5|$|Interest {{continued}} in {{the origins of the}} castle, which for a period were forgotten. Local medieval tradition suggested that the mound had been made by the devil, after he completed the dykes at Narborough and Newmarket, but by the Victorian period academics had concluded that the mound was either of Celtic or Norman origin, with late Victorian scholars correctly concluding that the Norman period was the most likely. Other traditions claimed that the mound covered a palace filled with treasure, or six silver bells from Thetford Priory. Archaeological investigations into Red Castle by G. <b>Knocker</b> between 1957–58, and during the early 1960s by R. R. Clarke and Barbara Green revealed the design and date of this castle site.|$|E
5|$|Mickl {{remained}} {{in charge of}} the 42nd Panzerjäger Battalion during the invasion. He got along well with Rommel, and his battalion fought well but suffered serious casualties during the Battle of Arras on 21 May while trying to stop the heavily armoured tanks of the British 1st Army Tank Brigade with its 37 mm anti-tank guns. His soldiers derided their guns as Panzeranklopfgerät (tank-door <b>knocker),</b> due to their failure to penetrate the British Matilda I and Matilda II tanks. Mickl's battalion tried to protect the exposed flank of the division, but was overrun. The situation was saved by anti-aircraft guns and field artillery which were able to knock out the British tanks with direct fire.|$|E
50|$|The farmer is {{connected}} to the shaft of the whirligig by a bamboo stick with an offset where the stick connects to the shaft. The result is: as the shaft turns the farmer’s arm lifts from the offset shaft which makes the farmer pull the string which lifts the bull’s head.The shaft contains a second feature, a set of <b>knockers</b> that create a bit of music on raised pieces of bamboo. There are a total of six <b>knockers</b> which strike six bamboo plates. The bamboo plates are raised by placing a circular piece of bamboo or something similar between the <b>knockers</b> and the bamboo base. Each rotation causes three <b>knockers</b> to hit plates so the sound is actually different at each rotation. The <b>knockers</b> are nailed in pattern to the shaft.|$|R

By Minnesota statute, <b>knockers</b> must be at most 1 in diameter, 30 in long, and 1 lb weight. The plants are not beaten with the <b>knockers</b> but require only a gentle brushing to dislodge the mature grain. The Ojibwa people call this plant manoomin, meaning [...] "harvesting berry" [...] (commonly translated [...] "good berry"). Some seeds fall to the muddy bottom and germinate later in the year.|$|R

5|$|The {{history of}} Brasenose College, Oxford {{stretches}} back to 1509, when the college {{was founded on}} the site of Brasenose Hall. Its name is believed to derive from the name of a bronze <b>knocker</b> that adorned the hall's door. The college was associated with Lancashire and Cheshire, the county origins of its two founders– Sir Richard Sutton and the Bishop of Lincoln, William Smyth– a link that was maintained strongly until {{the latter half of the}} nineteenth century. The first principals navigated Brasenose, with its Catholic sympathisers, through the reformation and continuing religious reforms. Most of Brasenose favoured the Royalist side during the English Civil War, although it produced notable generals and clergy on both sides. The library and chapel were completed in the mid-seventeenth century, despite Brasenose suffering continuing financial problems.|$|E
5|$|Gatiss {{originally}} resisted having Dickens {{star in the}} episode, as {{traditionally the}} Doctor only mentioned meeting historical figures, but he eventually warmed to the idea. As A Christmas Carol fan, Gatiss wanted to set the episode at Christmas. He later realised that Dickens' journey in the episode mirrored that of Ebenezer Scrooge. In one scene, Gatiss wanted the <b>knocker</b> on a door behind Dickens to briefly show the Gelth's face in reference to A Christmas Carol, but this visual effect was not done. The episode originally began in the TARDIS, as Gatiss wanted the first glimpse of 1860 to be through Rose's eyes. While this changed, Gatiss still wanted to show how great travelling in time is. It was scripted that snow would blow into the TARDIS when the doors opened, but this was cut because of budget reasons. Davies requested {{a scene in which}} the Doctor takes Rose to the future to see a world filled with walking corpses— the result if they had left before defeating the Gelth— but this was too expensive to film. During the scene in which the Doctor and Dickens are talking in the coach, the driver was supposed to shout down to them (referencing a Dickens work) and the coach was to crash, but this was also too expensive.|$|E

50|$|According to some Cornish folklore, the <b>Knockers</b> {{were the}} helpful spirits {{of people who}} had died in {{previous}} accidents in the many tin mines in the county, warning the miners of impending danger.

25|$|Mediæval European miners {{believed}} in underground spirits. The kobold filled this role in German folklore and {{is similar to}} other creatures of the type, such as the English bluecap, Cornish <b>knocker</b> and the Welsh coblynau. Stories of subterranean kobolds were common in Germany by the 16th century. Superstitious miners believed the creatures to be expert miners and metalworkers who could be heard constantly drilling, hammering, and shoveling. Some stories claim that the kobolds live in the rock, just as human beings live in the air.|$|E
25|$|The kobold's origins are obscure. Sources {{equate the}} {{domestic}} kobold with creatures {{such as the}} English boggart, hobgoblin and pixy, the Scottish brownie, and the Scandinavian nisse or tomte; while they align the subterranean variety with the Norse dwarf and the Cornish <b>knocker.</b> Irish historian Thomas Keightley argued that the German kobold and the Scandinavian nis predate the Irish fairy and the Scottish brownie and influenced the beliefs in those entities, but American folklorist Richard Mercer Dorson has discounted this argument as reflecting Keightley's bias toward Gotho-Germanic ideas over Celtic ones.|$|E

These values may change from season to season due to water availability and commodity prices.|$|E

500|$|The first {{reference}} to a [...] "Brasenose Hall" [...] {{is found in the}} forged charter of 1219, occupying at that time only one small part of the current site. It was recorded in 1278 as having four scholars, although over the next fifty years it was to acquire some corporate strength. The name [...] "Brasenose" [...] is thought to originate from a brass–lead door <b>knocker</b> in the shape of leopard (or lion) head; the nose-shaped door <b>knocker</b> of which one version now hangs above the high table of the main hall of Brasenose College. An alternative theory is that the name is a corruption of brasenhuis (brewhouse), but this is not widely accepted, although the college did have its own brewhouse up until 1889. This theory is believed to date back only to 1837.|$|E
500|$|During the 1333 {{disturbances}} in Oxford, {{a group of}} clerks from Brasenose Hall left the ongoing violence and {{made their way to}} Stamford, Lincolnshire. The Brasenose <b>knocker</b> was taken with them as a symbol of continuity, and only believed returned in 1890. Although Edward III intervened, ordering the students to return, some persisted in Stamford and acquired a second [...] "Brasenose Hall" [...] there. In 1381, Brasenose Hall, Oxford, acquired a lease from University College for parts of the current site. The Stamford establishment was considered a rival, and candidates for degrees at Oxford, were required to swear that they would not give or attend lectures in Stamford as late as 1827. Between 1480 and 1509 the Hall was responsible for supplying a vice-chancellor of the University and two of its proctors. Throughout this period, Brasenose appears to have aligned itself with Oxford's [...] "Northerners" [...] during periods of Northerner–Southerner violence in Oxford. In 1890 the college purchased Brazenose House [...] in Stamford and removed the <b>knocker</b> to Oxford.|$|E
