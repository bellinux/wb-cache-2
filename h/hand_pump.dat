50|$|Deep well <b>hand</b> <b>pumps</b> {{are used}} for high lifts of more than 15 m. The weight of the column of water is too great to be lifted {{directly}} and some form of mechanical advantage system such as a lever or flywheel is used.High lift pumps need to be stronger and sturdier {{to cope with the}} extra stresses. The installation, maintenance and repair of deep well <b>hand</b> <b>pumps</b> is more complicated than with other <b>hand</b> <b>pumps.</b>|$|R

25|$|The Sea Fury was {{powered by}} the newly {{developed}} Bristol Centaurus piston engine, which drove a five-bladed propeller. Many of the engine's subsystems, such as the fully automated cooling system, cockpit gauges, and fuel booster pump were electrical, powered by an engine-driven generator supplemented by two independent batteries. The hydraulic system, necessary to operate the retractable undercarriage, tail hook, and flaps, was pressurised to 1,800 psi by an engine-driven pump. If this failed a <b>hand</b> <b>pump</b> in the cockpit could also power these systems, a pneumatic pump was also driven by the engine for the brakes. Internal fuel was stored {{in a total of}} five self-sealing fuel tanks, two within the fuselage {{directly in front of the}} cockpit and three housed within the wings.|$|E
25|$|A 2004 BBC Radio 5 {{broadcast}} {{reported the}} site is contaminated with toxic chemicals including benzene hexachloride and mercury, held in open containers or loose on the ground. A drinking water sample from a well near the site had levels of contamination 500 {{times higher than the}} maximum limits recommended by the World Health Organization. In 2009, the Centre for Science and Environment, a Delhi-based pollution monitoring lab, released test results showing pesticide groundwater contamination up to three kilometres from the factory. Also in 2009, the BBC took a water sample from a frequently used <b>hand</b> <b>pump,</b> located just north of the plant. The sample, tested in UK, was found to contain 1,000 times the World Health Organization's recommended maximum amount of carbon tetrachloride, a carcinogenic toxin.|$|E
25|$|On 6March 1878, Henry Woollcombe took {{command of}} Endymion. This {{was due to}} the death of Rear-Admiral William Charles Chamberlain, Superintendent at Devonport. Captain Leveson Somerset, in command at Bermuda was {{promoted}} to the vacated position. Moresby was promoted to the Bermuda position and Woollcombe was promoted to replace him as captain of Endymion. On 12 April, a fire developed in shops at the Market Place, Hull. Forty marines from Endymion assisted the Hull Police in fighting the fire. They brought a <b>hand</b> <b>pump</b> but was unable to use it owing to incompatibility of the hose and hydrant, being different sizes. On 22August, a private in the Royal Marines was court-martialled at Portsmouth for desertion from Endymion. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six months imprisonment and dismissal from service.|$|E

50|$|For example, {{in a rural}} sub-Saharan {{community}} it may not {{be appropriate}} to provide a chlorinated and pumped water system because it cannot be maintained or controlled adequately - simple <b>hand</b> <b>pumps</b> may be better; while in a big city in the same country it would be inappropriate to provide water with <b>hand</b> <b>pumps,</b> and the chlorinated system would be the correct response.|$|R
25|$|The {{essential}} {{differences between}} a traditional cask and a keg {{are that the}} latter has a centrally located downtube and a valve that allows beer in and gas out when filling and vice versa when beer is dispensed. Also kegs have a simple concave bottom whilst the barrel or cask design allows sediment to be retained in the cask. This aspect of keg design means that all the beer in the keg is dispensed, which therefore requires that the beer be processed by filtration, fining or centrifuging, {{or some combination of}} these, to prevent sediment formation. Lastly, kegs have straight sides unlike the traditional barrel or cask shape. In order to get the beer out of a keg and into a customer's glass, it can be forced out with gas pressure, although if air or gas at low pressure is admitted {{to the top of the}} keg it can also be dispensed using a traditional <b>hand</b> <b>pump</b> at the bar.|$|E

50|$|However, villagers did {{not stop}} using {{traditional}} means of gathering water during this project. This was especially true when rain provided villagers with shallow water sources. These shallow wells were often easier to access than the wells with <b>hand</b> <b>pumps.</b> When faced with the option of using near surface water or traveling to the <b>hand</b> <b>pumps,</b> many villagers chose the former.|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} a Bank funded project that {{highlights}} many issues of <b>hand</b> <b>pumps</b> is the 1992 Mali Rural Supply Project. The project brought approximately 230 rural villages inclined towards periods of drought, and 228,000 people access to safe water. The project is notable {{in its attempt to}} bring responsibility for the upkeep of the pumps to the villages themselves. The complexity of the pumps is a fundamental problem for all programs of this kind, as well as the quality of the pumps given the heavy demands of a village. A 1994 study, also Bank funded, of the endurance of <b>hand</b> <b>pumps</b> in Africa showed that only 41 to 51 percent of <b>hand</b> <b>pumps</b> were still functioning. The Mali Rural Supply Project did positively affect the longevity of <b>hand</b> <b>pumps</b> by doing the following: establishing local depots of spare parts, training individuals to maintain pumps, scheduling inspections from officials of the project, forming local committees and recruiting volunteers.|$|R

500|$|Cask-conditioned ales (or cask ales) are {{unfiltered}} and unpasteurised beers. These beers are termed [...] "real ale" [...] by the CAMRA organisation. Typically, when a cask {{arrives in}} a pub, it is placed horizontally on a frame called a [...] "stillage" [...] {{which is designed}} to hold it steady and at the right angle, and then allowed to cool to cellar temperature (typically between [...] ), before being tapped and vented—a tap is driven through a (usually rubber) bung at the bottom of one end, and a hard spile or other implement is used to open a hole {{in the side of the}} cask, which is now uppermost. The act of stillaging and then venting a beer in this manner typically disturbs all the sediment, so it must be left for a suitable period to [...] "drop" [...] (clear) again, as well as to fully condition — this period can take anywhere from several hours to several days. At this point the beer is ready to sell, either being pulled through a beer line with a <b>hand</b> <b>pump,</b> or simply being [...] "gravity-fed" [...] directly into the glass.|$|E
500|$|According to the Smithsonian, Roper's first {{velocipede}} of 1867–1869 used {{a purpose}} built frame rather than adapting an existing velocipede frame by retrofitting a steam engine, but one contemporary newspaper account does assert that Roper repurposed a velocipede frame, and Setright and motoring author Roland Brown say Roper used a hickory wood frame {{built by the}} Hanlon Brothers, who made and demonstrated boneshakers at fairs and circuses, although the Smithsonian's Roper has an iron frame. It had a wheelbase of [...] and two [...] diameter wheels made of iron bands on wooden s with wooden spokes. It had a rigid, forged iron fork, and a solid handlebar with wooden grips. Unlike the modern twistgrip, where the grip on only one side is a sleeve that rotates around the handlebar to open the throttle, the Roper velocipede's entire bar was rotated with both hands, {{and it had a}} dual function. When turned forward, the throttle opened, and when turned backwards it applied the spoon brake on the front wheel. The seat doubled as the water reservoir; or the water tank can be described as saddle shaped. A <b>hand</b> <b>pump</b> transferred water from this tank to the boiler. The boiler was between the wheels with a [...] "nautical looking" [...] chimney from the boiler angling backwards behind the rider, with the firebox in the lower half of this housing, all of which hung from the frame with a spring to absorb shock, while two stay rods attached the bottom of the housing {{to the back of the}} frame. There were three water level cocks on the left side, near the water pump, and a drain valve on the bottom. The two cylinders, with bores of about [...] were located on either side of the frame, from the upper part of the boiler near the chimney, connecting to [...] cranks on the rear wheel. Exhaust steam, conveyed by tubing to the base of the chimney, provided a forced draft.|$|E

2500|$|Initially, {{the lifting}} {{mechanism}} {{consisted of a}} standard 8-ton aeroplane jack that took three minutes to raise the fort.
