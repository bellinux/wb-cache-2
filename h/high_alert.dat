5|$|Prior to the system's first landfall, the EPHC {{noted the}} threat of high waves, storm surge, and flooding. In addition, the navy, army, and police were on <b>high</b> <b>alert</b> in {{populated}} areas like La Paz due to the hurricane. On the mainland, roughly 700 people evacuated to shelters in Huatampo, a city that at that time had a population of 9,000, and Yavaros prior to landfall, but within hours {{after the passage of}} the hurricane, all but 127 had returned home.|$|E
5|$|While at peak intensity, {{the storm}} {{threatened}} Mozambique and forcing authorities {{to put the}} country on <b>high</b> <b>alert.</b> The British Foreign Office also issued a travel warning to Britons who were planning visits along the Bazaruto Archipelago. Additionally, the South African disaster management team was on full alert in the eastern portion of Mpumalanga. In addition, thousands of volunteers were placed on stand by.|$|E
5|$|In March 1695, Captain Juan Díaz de Velasco set {{out from}} Cahabón in Alta Verapaz, Guatemala, with 70 Spanish soldiers, {{accompanied}} by {{a large number of}} Maya archers from Verapaz, native muleteers, and four Dominican friars. The Spanish pressed ahead to Lake Petén Itzá and engaged in a series of fierce skirmishes with Itza hunting parties. At the lakeshore, within sight of Nojpetén, the Spanish encountered such a large force of Itzas that they retreated south, back to their main camp. Interrogation of an Itza prisoner revealed that the Itza kingdom {{was in a state of}} <b>high</b> <b>alert</b> to repel the Spanish; the expedition almost immediately withdrew back to Cahabón.|$|E

5|$|No. 825 Squadron FAA {{and their}} Fairey Swordfish were also made available. Lockheed Hudson's of No. 224 Squadron RAF and No. 233 Squadron RAF were also {{committed}} for reconnaissance operations. No. 22 Squadron RAF was recalled from leave {{to take part}} in any potential operation in the Channel. Hudsons from No. 407 Squadron RCAF were also available, and were placed on <b>high</b> <b>alert.</b> They took part in the fighting. RAF Bomber Command contributed its No. 5 Group RAF, containing some 242 of the 300 aircraft available to the service.|$|E
5|$|On 2 May 1945 {{news was}} {{received}} that all German forces {{west of the}} Isonzo River had surrendered. While this did not officially end the fighting in Italy, it was all but over. Five days later, {{on the night of}} 7 May, the battalion received the news that Germany had surrendered unconditionally to the Allies, and that the war in Europe was over. Nevertheless, tensions remained high and concerns about the intentions of Yugoslavia regarding the disputed province of Istria meant that the 28th (Māori) Battalion remained on <b>high</b> <b>alert.</b> This continued until early June when an agreement was reached and Yugoslavia withdrew its troops east of the Isonzo River.|$|E
5|$|Positioning the Second and Third Armies {{with their}} {{bridging}} equipment along the canal {{in preparation for}} Operation Badr would put the Israelis on <b>high</b> <b>alert.</b> Without {{the element of surprise}} Egyptian forces would suffer high losses in the attack (estimates for casualties already ran in the thousands). The Directorate of Military Intelligence (abbreviated Aman), which formulated Israel's intelligence estimate and was known for its competency, was tasked with detecting troop movements and activity along Egyptian and Syrian forces; military activity which would be particularly intensive in the last days preceding the assault.|$|E
50|$|Polls {{opened at}} 7:00 {{and there were}} over 52 million {{eligible}} voters {{to vote for the}} more than 18,000 positions. In addition, police and military forces were put on <b>higher</b> <b>alert</b> for expectations of violence which had resulted in about 60 deaths since campaigning began.|$|R
25|$|Although {{there were}} {{security}} alerts at many locations throughout the United Kingdom, no other terrorist incidents occurred outside central London. Suspicious packages were destroyed in controlled explosions in Edinburgh, Brighton, Coventry, Southampton, Portsmouth, Darlington and Nottingham.

50|$|In {{reaction}} to a second major terrorist attack on a public transport system in the 7 July 2005 London bombings, the police deployed armed Police Tactical Unit officers to patrol within stations {{the day after the}} bombings occurred, while pre-existing security measures were placed on <b>higher</b> <b>alert.</b>|$|R
5|$|Although the casemates {{have been}} altered over the years, {{many of their}} {{original}} features survive. None of the guns remain in situ but the metal rails on which they traversed are still in place. The casemates {{were divided into two}} sections. During periods of <b>high</b> <b>alert</b> the gun crews would live next to their weapons in the casemates' rear, an area known as the war accommodation. The front of the casemate was the gun emplacement proper, where the loading and firing took place. The iron shield protecting each casemate was fitted with iron bars from which two mantlets made of thick lengths of rope were hung. These protected the gun crew from splinters and smoke. A loading bar above the gun-port enabled the crew to lift the heavy shells and cartridges up to the mouth of the gun. These were dispensed from the magazines below via lifts {{on either side of the}} emplacements.|$|E
5|$|The Command was too {{expensive}} to maintain and cost cuts were made during the 1950s which caused a reduction in strength. By mid-1957 the Command had been cut to 82 aircraft. By mid-1958 it had shrunk to just 67. The Shackletons dominated {{the core of this}} force, numbering 54 aircraft. The Neptune was cut from the service altogether, beginning on 31 August 1956. There was little operational action for the Command at this point. It airlifted British Army forces into Egypt during the Suez Crisis which was its major action during this period. The lack of funds and any active conventional military role saw the Command struggle to keep its front-line strength high. There was a brief alert in October 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, when all six squadrons it then possessed were put on <b>high</b> <b>alert,</b> but nothing came of the crisis, although the Shackleton squadrons at RAF Ballykelly were sent to Macrihanish as it was known that Ballykelly was on the Soviet IRBM target list.|$|E
5|$|By April 1943, Western Area {{controlled}} four combat units: No.14 Squadron, flying Bristol Beaufort reconnaissance-bombers out of Pearce; No.25 Squadron, {{tasked with}} dive-bombing missions in Wirraways based at Pearce; No.76 Squadron, flying P-40 Kittyhawks out of Potshot (Exmouth Gulf); and No.85 Squadron, operating CAC Boomerang fighters from Pearce. The area command was {{also able to}} call on US Navy Catalinas of Patrol Wing10, based at Crawley, for reconnaissance and anti-submarine missions. The Beauforts and Catalinas flew several hundred maritime patrols during 1943. In March 1944, Western Area went on <b>high</b> <b>alert</b> in response to concerns that a Japanese naval force would raid Western Australia. Perth was reinforced with Nos.452 and 457 Squadrons, and Exmouth Gulf with Nos.18, 31, and 120 Squadrons, but no attack ensued and the units were directed {{to return to their}} home bases. The US Navy withdrew Patrol Wing10 mid-year, curtailing Western Area's ability to conduct long-range maritime reconnaissance; No.14 Squadron's fifteen serviceable Beauforts had to fly patrols of up to twenty-two hours in duration to search for German submarines reported in the area. As of 31May 1944, Western Area headquarters staff numbered 686, including 118 officers.|$|E

5|$|On 24 April, {{the first}} {{prisoner}} {{escaped from the}} main camp; {{the same day that}} the injured second prisoner was taken in by Machuca and his men. Interrogation of the new prisoner, {{who turned out to be}} an Itza nobleman, revealed that the Itza kingdom was in a state of <b>high</b> <b>alert</b> to repel the Spanish. Friar Cano met with his fellow Dominicans to discuss what should be done, having had information from both Machuca and his prisoner that the Itza were ready for war. The Dominicans were highly critical of the Spanish soldiers' readiness to open fire on poorly armed natives who offered no real threat to them, and suspected that President Barrios was nowhere near the lake; furthermore the Spanish were beginning to succumb to sickness, and the Verapaz Indian recruits were deserting daily. Díaz agreed with the Dominicans; two muleteers had already died from sickness, and he recognised that the size of his expedition was not sufficient for a full confrontation with the Itza nation. The expedition almost immediately withdrew back to Cahabón. The new prisoner, AjK'ixaw was later taken back to Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, where the Dominicans questioned him in detail. In Guatemala AjK'ixaw learnt Spanish and returned to Petén in 1696 as a guide and interpreter for another expedition, before turning on his captors. After the Spanish retreated to Guatemala, rumours ran rife among the Itza and Kowoj that they would return to engage in wholesale slaughter of the Maya population; large tracts of territory were abandoned in response, including many towns in an area stretching from Lake Petén Itzá eastwards to Tipuj and southwards to Mopán.|$|E
5|$|The Australian {{withdrawal}} from Vietnam brought {{to an end}} the doctrine of 'forward defence' through involvement in Southeast Asian wars. Instead, the Australian military's new focus was on the defence of continental Australia against external attack. In line with this change, the SASR {{took the lead in}} developing the Australian Army's capability to conduct patrol operations in Northern Australia. It was later recognised that this role required dedicated units with the Army forming three Regional Force Surveillance Units in the early 1980s trained by the SASR. In July 1977 two SASR patrols were deployed to north Irian Jaya with the approval of Indonesian authorities to provide first aid to the survivors of an RAAF Iroquois helicopter which had crashed in the remote jungle during survey operations, and to secure the wreckage from possibly being captured by members of the OPM independence movement. During this time the SASR also continued to train overseas with other special forces units. On one such exercise in the Philippines, a US special forces C-130 Hercules crashed into the South China Sea shortly after take-off from Subic Bay on 26 February 1981, killing 23 passengers including three Australians from the SASR, {{as well as a number}} of Americans, Filipinos, and New Zealanders. Meanwhile, following the Sydney Hilton bombing in February 1978, the SASR was given responsibility for providing Australia's military counter-terrorism response force, for which 2 Squadron was raised again in 1982. In addition to being able to respond to terrorist attacks in Australian cities, the SASR counter-terrorism unit was required to develop a capability to board ships underway and off-shore oil platforms together with clearance divers from the Navy Clearance Diving Branch. In May 1987 a squadron from the SASR was alerted for a possible deployment to Fiji as part of Operation Morris Dance, but did not leave Australia. The regiment was not involved in operations during the Gulf War in 1991 although two troops were again placed on standby for deployment at short notice, while other elements remained on <b>high</b> <b>alert</b> to respond to a terrorist incident in Australia if required.|$|E
