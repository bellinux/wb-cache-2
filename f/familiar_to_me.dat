6000|$|... “Not absolutely; but {{the deep}} {{learning}} of Mr. Jones is more <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> {{or even the}} polite masquerade of Monsieur Le Quoi.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Babcock?" [...] he said. [...] "Do you know, {{that name}} seems <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> somehow. I'm almost sure I've {{read it in}} the paper or something." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} see the man's face because of the blanket, but his voice sounded <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and I grew afraid. Still I must speak.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, it won't do, Sir Henry--it won't do! Even your voice, {{though you}} sunk {{it a few}} notes, was <b>familiar</b> enough <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> But hang it, man! What {{did you do it}} for? That's what gets over me. That you should stick up me, one of your closest friends, a man that worked himself to the bone when you stood for the division--and all {{for the sake of a}} Brummagem watch and a few shillings--is simply incredible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see," [...] he had said, on the {{day when}} he {{introduced}} it, [...] "I've come to grief so often in the matter of chairs that I've become chary as to how I use 'em. If all the chairs that I've had go crash under me was put together they'd furnish a good-sized house. Look before you leap is a well-known proverb, but, look before you sit down, has become a more <b>familiar</b> experience <b>to</b> <b>me</b> through life. It's an awkward thing bein' so heavy, and I hope you'll never know what it is, ladies." ...|$|R
5000|$|Fear of the unknown. They {{are afraid}} of new ideas. They are loaded with prejudices, not based upon {{anything}} in reality, but based on … if something is new, I reject it immediately because it’s frightening <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> What they do instead is just stay with the <b>familiar.</b> You know, <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> the most beautiful things in all the universe are the most mysterious.|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw you," [...] said Bonover, [...] "talking to a {{young lady}} in the avenue. Her face was somehow quite <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Who was she?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{in other}} things, I think," [...] {{he said with}} meaning, {{in a voice that}} seemed <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "Well, can I see the Prince Seti?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, now I understand,' said Merton; 'I {{knew that}} {{your face and}} voice were <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Did you not act in a revival of The Country Wife?' ...|$|E
60|$|The Duke came punctually, {{spruce and}} debonnair, a small rose in his buttonhole, his wizened cheeks aglow with the smart of the {{stinging}} east wind. With him came Lord Chelsford, whose face and figure were <b>familiar</b> enough <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{from the pages}} of the illustrated papers. Dark, spare, and tall, he spoke seldom, but I felt all the while the merciless investigation of his searching eyes. The Duke, on the other hand, seemed to have thrown aside some part of his customary reserve. He spoke at greater length and with more freedom than I had heard him.|$|R
6000|$|... "No. Heaven {{knows what}} the objects of his studies are. But here we are, and you must form your own {{impressions}} about him." [...] As he spoke, we turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small side-door, which opened into a wing of the great hospital. It was <b>familiar</b> ground <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and made our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashed wall and dun-coloured doors. Near the further end a low arched passage branched away from it {{and led to the}} chemical laboratory.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have {{the bills}} in, J. J.," [...] says Clive. [...] "Leave your cards on your friends, old boy; {{say good-bye to}} that pretty little strawberry-girl whose picture you have been doing; polish it off to-day, and dry the little thing's tears. I read P.P.C. in the stars last night, and my <b>familiar</b> spirit came <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in a vision, and said, 'Clive, son of Thomas, put thy travelling-boots on.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The boy departed, and {{presently}} I saw a {{face that}} seemed <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> peeping round {{the edge of the}} gateway. After a careful inspection its owner emerged.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I will go at {{once and}} make inquiry. The name Milton is not <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> but so many come and go that we {{sometimes}} forget names." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Most beautiful!" [...] said Nigel, gazing {{intently at}} the portrait. [...] "That dear child's face seems so <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that I could almost fancy I had seen it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is almost}} another tie between us," [...] she said. [...] "We have {{your name in}} France--it speaks with a <b>familiar</b> sound <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in this strange place. Dear Miss Stella, when my poor boy startled you by that cry for food, he {{recalled}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> the saddest of all my anxieties. When I think of him, I should be tempted if my better sense did not restrain me--No! no! put back the pocketbook. I am incapable of the shameless audacity of borrowing a sum of money which I could never repay. Let {{me tell you what}} my trouble is, and you will understand that I am in earnest. I had two sons, Miss Stella. The elder--the most lovable, the most affectionate of my children--was killed in a duel." ...|$|R
60|$|It terminates (the lane I mean) in {{a valley}} full of wood; which wood--chiefly oak and beech--spreads shadowy about the vicinage of a very old mansion, one of the Elizabethan structures, much larger, {{as well as more}} antique than Daisy Lane, the {{property}} and residence of an individual <b>familiar</b> both <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and <b>to</b> the reader. Yes, in Hunsden Wood--for so are those glades and that grey building, with many gables and more chimneys, named--abides Yorke Hunsden, still unmarried; never, I suppose, having yet found his ideal, though I know at least a score of young ladies within a circuit of forty miles, who would be willing to assist him in the search.|$|R
6000|$|The spring nights {{which came}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> there at Colony {{were of a}} quality quite new <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> The breeze, amiable and moist, was Southern, and the {{moonlight}} falling from the sky like a silent, all-enveloping cataract of silver, lay along the ground so mystically real that I could feel it with my hand. The air was at once tropic and Western, and this subtle blending of the North and the South, the strange and the <b>familiar,</b> appealed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> with such power that I wrote Zulime a statement of my belief that in becoming a part-owner in this land, I had assured for us both a happy and prosperous future. [...] "I shall come here every spring," [...] I declared, and {{in the glow of}} this enthusiasm, I purchased another farm of two hundred and forty acres and arranged with Seger for its management.|$|R
6000|$|Gliding to {{the seat}} where, half-lathered, the more or less ancient Mariner awaited Poll's return, the Prince muttered (in the French lingo, <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> from long exile in Boulogne): ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can't you {{remember}} his native name?" [...] asked another voice {{which was also}} <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> for I never forget voices though I am unable to place them at once.|$|E
6000|$|... "My young friend," [...] he said, [...] "your face is not <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> but I cannot refuse your kindly offer. It {{must be the}} last, however, {{absolutely}} the last." ...|$|E
60|$|The Tribune was yet empty when we entered, but in {{ten minutes}} after it was filled; suddenly, in a second of time, a head, chest, and arms grew above the crimson desk. This head I knew: its colour, shape, port, expression, were <b>familiar</b> both <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and Miss Fanshawe; the {{blackness}} and closeness of cranium, the amplitude and paleness of brow, the blueness and fire of glance, were details so domesticated in the memory, and so knit with many a whimsical association, as almost by this their sudden apparition, to tickle fancy to a laugh. Indeed, I confess, for my part, I did laugh till I was warm; but then I bent my head, and made my handkerchief and a lowered veil the sole confidants of my mirth.|$|R
6000|$|My strangeness, {{which had}} made me sleepless, had {{prompted}} that unconventional arrangement, as if I had expected in those solitary {{hours of the night}} to get on terms with the ship of which I knew nothing, manned by men of whom I knew very little more. Fast alongside a wharf, littered like any ship in port with a tangle of unrelated things, invaded by unrelated shore people, I had hardly seen her yet properly. Now, as she lay cleared for sea, the stretch of her maindeck seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> very fine under the stars. Very fine, very roomy for her size, and very inviting. I descended the poop and paced the waist, my mind picturing to myself the coming passage through the Malay Archipelago, down the Indian Ocean, and up the Atlantic. All its phases were <b>familiar</b> enough <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> every characteristic, all the alternatives which were likely <b>to</b> face <b>me</b> on the high seas--everything! [...] . except the novel responsibility of command. But I took heart from the reasonable thought that the ship was like other ships, the men like other men, and that the sea was not likely to keep any special surprises expressly for my discomfiture.|$|R
60|$|There {{is nothing}} strange in this, {{any more than}} there is {{anything}} strange in an instinct. An instinct is merely a habit that is stamped into the stuff of our heredity, that is all. It will be noted, in passing, that in this falling dream which is so <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> you and <b>me</b> and all of us, we never strike bottom. To strike bottom would be destruction. Those of our arboreal ancestors who struck bottom died forthwith. True, the shock of their fall was communicated to the cerebral cells, but they died immediately, before they could have progeny. You and I are descended from those that did not strike bottom; {{that is why you}} and I, in our dreams, never strike bottom.|$|R
6000|$|... "On the contrary," [...] said Clovis, [...] "the {{moustache}} is {{the only}} thing about you that seemed <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I felt certain that I had met it somewhere before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mrs. Bounderby,' said Harthouse, {{perfectly}} {{hearing this}} under- strain {{as it went}} on; 'your brother's face is quite <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Can I have seen him abroad? Or at some public school, perhaps?' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{went up to}} {{the place}} at which his brother was standing. In the simple, boyish way, so <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in the bygone time, he laid his hand on his brother's arm.|$|E
60|$|It was noon before I was released. Going on deck, I {{found that}} the {{schooner}} was at sea. Nothing of Halifax was visible but a tower or two, that were very <b>familiar</b> objects <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I confess I now began to regret the step I had taken, and, could I have been landed, it is probable my roving disposition would have received a salutary check. It was too late, however, and I was compelled {{to continue in the}} thorny and difficult path on which I had so thoughtlessly entered. I often look back to this moment, and try to imagine what might have been my fortunes, had I never taken this unlucky step. What the prince might have done for me, it is impossible to say; though I think it probable that, after the death of my father, I should have been forgotten, as seems to have been the case with my sister, who gradually fell from being considered and treated as one of the family in which she lived, into a sort of upper servant.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{would listen}} to no argument, but dashed {{out of the room}} like a madman. But perhaps these details are <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> you, and God knows they are painful <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> tell." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So please your honour's Grace," [...] replied English Wat, [...] "I confess it {{was very}} <b>familiar</b> in <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be sober when it was your Grace's {{pleasure}} that your train should be mad drunk; but in respect they were all Scottishmen but myself, I thought it argued no policy in getting drunken in their company, seeing that they only endure me even when we are all sober, and if the wine were uppermost, I might tell them a piece of my mind, and be paid with as many stabs as there are skenes in the good company." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A gentleman, a {{complete}} stranger," [...] she assented. [...] "This is his card. He seemed surprised {{that his name}} was not <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> He was quite sure that you would know it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A great name, my lord," [...] he said, bowing with grave {{ceremony}} to Wessex, [...] "and one <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> already, though I {{have not yet}} been honoured by seeing you at Court." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{a curious}} feeling as though your face were <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> It's been puzzling me for some time. But I can't situate my {{recollection}} {{in any place}} or at any time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Enough of this, sir," [...] said Claverhouse, in {{the tone}} of command which was <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> him; [...] "and let me know what you came <b>to</b> report <b>to</b> <b>me</b> just now." ...|$|R
5000|$|Knopfler {{explained}} in an interview, [...] "The pipes always made sense <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> {{and growing up}} in Glasgow as well as Newcastle, in my grandmother's home, there were Jimmy Shand records, so the sound of Celtic music always seems <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> me." ...|$|R
6000|$|He hesitated. She sprang on his knee; {{she pressed}} her cheek against his cheek with the caressing tenderness, <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> {{him in the first}} happy days when she was an infant. [...] "Oh, papa, {{are you going to be}} unkind <b>to</b> <b>me</b> for the first time in your life?" ...|$|R
