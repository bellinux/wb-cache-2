5|$|On July 8, 2016, the FBI {{announced}} that it was suspending active investigation of the Cooper case, citing a need to focus its investigative resources and manpower on issues of higher and more urgent priority. Local field offices will continue to accept any legitimate physical evidence—related specifically to the parachutes or the ransom money—that may emerge in the future. The 60-volume case file compiled over the 45-year course of the <b>investigation</b> <b>will</b> be preserved for historical purposes at FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C.|$|E

Since Michael Brown's death in Ferguson, Missouri, the US Department of Justice {{has made a}} call to action for police departments across the nation to implement body-worn cameras into their departments so further <b>investigation</b> <b>will</b> be possible.|$|E
25|$|The {{ship was}} only {{identified}} in 2015 after a historian found the map {{on which the}} Dutch navy had marked the wreck site and {{it was discovered that}} only one Dutch war ship had sunk that year, the Huis te Warmelo. The ship hit media attention in March 2016 when it was revealed that the unknown ship had a name and in what condition it was found in. She is the best preserved Dutch Navy ship found to this day and further <b>investigation</b> <b>will</b> be done on the wreck.|$|E
25|$|Norwegian police {{rounded up}} their {{investigation}} in May 2009. Until then, the detained suspect {{had been charged}} with 54 cases of sexual assault and attempted sexual assault; however, this number was raised with an unmentioned number at that time. He has admitted to involvement in 20 cases. The suspect who has been detained throughout the <b>investigation</b> <b>will</b> remain in custody until at least the end of August 2009. He has consistently agreed to prolonged detention to avoid being hounded by the news media should he have been released before the trial.|$|E

25|$|On 7 September, NBI {{reported}} that Bouanane had planned two alternative targets besides Turku Market Square. Robin Lardot, Director of NBI, {{told that the}} suspect was seeking a martyr's death during the attack. He possessed ISIS propaganda and had drafted a manifesto regarding the attack. Police had obtained a video in which Bouanane read the manifesto along with citations from the Quran outside Turku Cathedral before disseminating the video to a group chat on an instant messaging service. Lardot also emphasised that the <b>investigation</b> <b>will</b> continue for months {{in part due to}} the need to translate Arabic material.|$|E
25|$|At Roosevelt's request, Moore, Kreizler, and he {{meet the}} {{following}} morning in Roosevelt's office to discuss the case. Kreizler has examined the body and disagrees with the official coroner's report. He connects the Santorelli killing {{to that of a}} second case he knows of in which two children, Benjamin and Sofia Zweig, were killed and had their eyes gouged out. Roosevelt announces that he knows of two more murders that match the pattern. Roosevelt decides to investigate, but because Kreizler has such a dubious reputation as an alienist, and because the <b>investigation</b> <b>will</b> become politically difficult, he establishes a base of operations for them outside the police precinct. Politically, Roosevelt cannot afford {{to be associated with the}} investigation and is not involved with the day-to-day operations.|$|E
25|$|Geotechnical {{investigations}} are performed by geotechnical engineers or engineering geologists {{to obtain information}} on the physical properties of soil and rock around a site to design earthworks and foundations for proposed structures and for repair of distress to earthworks and structures caused by subsurface conditions. This type of investigation is called a site investigation. Additionally, geotechnical {{investigations are}} also {{used to measure the}} thermal resistivity of soils or backfill materials required for underground transmission lines, oil and gas pipelines, radioactive waste disposal, and solar thermal storage facilities. A geotechnical <b>investigation</b> <b>will</b> include surface exploration and subsurface exploration of a site. Sometimes, geophysical methods are used to obtain data about sites. Subsurface exploration usually involves soil sampling and laboratory tests of the soil samples retrieved.|$|E

25|$|In any study, some of {{the protein}} domains, those under <b>investigation,</b> <b>will</b> be varied {{according}} to {{the goals of the}} study whereas other domains, those that are not themselves being investigated, will be kept constant. For example, in a two-hybrid study to select DNA-binding domains, the DNA-binding domain, BD, will be varied while the two interacting proteins, the bait and prey, must be kept constant to maintain a strong binding between the BD and AD. There are a number of domains from which to choose the BD, bait and prey and AD, if these are to remain constant. In protein–protein interaction investigations, the BD may be chosen from any of many strong DNA-binding domains such as Zif268. A frequent choice of bait and prey domains are residues 263–352 of yeast Gal11P with a N342V mutation and residues 58–97 of yeast Gal4, respectively. These domains can be used in both yeast- and bacterial-based selection techniques and are known to bind together strongly.|$|E
25|$|We want {{every man}} and woman in these two {{counties}} to recall the dates of these murders and also to recall whether or not any person close to them was missing or out of pocket during those nights. Persons who have such information and have been withholding it when they know they should report it are leaving themselves open to possible charges of complicity in event the slayer is captured. Make no mistake {{about the fact that}} the slayer will be captured because we will not give up this hunt until he has been captured or killed. All information received will be treated confidentially. We urge you to come in and tell what you know. Don't be hesitant or fear that you are causing an innocent man embarrassment and trouble in as much all <b>investigation</b> <b>will</b> be confidential. This is no time to take any chance on information which might lead us to the slayer. This maniac must be captured. We believe that we are justified in going to any ends to halt this chain of murder. Bear in mind--this killer may strike at any one. He may strike at persons close to him. For that reason, we believe any person with information that may lead us to the murderer should act in the interest of self-preservation.|$|E

This compound, named calostomal, is responsible for the orange-red color of the fruit bodies. The methyl ester of calostomal was subjected to NMR spectroscopy and was identified as all-trans-16-oxohexadeca-2,4,6,8,10,12,14-heptaenoic acid. Chemically related pigments, the boletocrocins, had been isolated from the brightly colored Boletus laetissimus and B.rufoaureus.

500|$|In a {{press conference}} on August 8, 2009, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg (an {{airplane}} and helicopter pilot himself) stated that [...] "Until the National Transportation Safety Board makes a determination, nothing is a fact" [...] and stressed that the <b>investigation</b> <b>will</b> take weeks or months before those facts are known. Representatives from the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA), including AOPA President Craig Fuller, have appeared on numerous news programs and collaborated with news sources to explain {{the workings of the}} Hudson River VFR corridor and the safety record of flights in that area.|$|E
500|$|Global Times, {{a tabloid}} {{subsidiary}} of People's Daily, wrote three successive belligerent editorials on the case, an act viewed by Hong Kong media as an indirect recognition of China's {{role in the}} disappearances. The first editorial, on 4 January, opined that the bookshop's business model depended on [...] "stirring up troubles on the mainland ..... that it interferes with mainland affairs in a disguised way, and damages the mainland's vital interests to maintain its harmony and stability." [...] On 6 January 2016, they published another editorial stating that Causeway Bay Books being under investigation by Chinese officials for slander is [...] "reasonable", and also noted that [...] "all powerful agencies {{in the world have}} ways to evade the law, so that those under <b>investigation</b> <b>will</b> cooperate".|$|E

40|$|A {{survey of}} exo-electron {{emission}} literature {{has shown that}} the mechanism of exo-emission phenomena has yet to be ascertained. Also, there is probably no unique mechanism that will apply to all the exo-emission observations reported. For exo-emission to occur, trapping centers must first be formed to store electrons. Once such centers are formed, they can be made to give up their trapped electrons by the stimulation of light or oxygen. Future <b>investigations</b> <b>will</b> employ light-transparent films for collecting exo-electrons. Also, a carefully controlled experiment is necessary to detect the emission of exo-electrons from the surface of fatiguing metals. <b>Investigations</b> <b>will</b> include high-vacuum fatigue tests, autoradiography, and solid state collector experiments, and will provide a basis for future research on semiconductor layer collection...|$|R
