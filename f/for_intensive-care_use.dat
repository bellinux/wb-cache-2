40|$|Background: The Hospice Palliative Care Act in Taiwan was amended {{and allowed}} {{families}} to withdraw life-sustaining treatment for unconsciousness terminally ill patients. However, ventilator withdrawal {{in the intensive}} care unit (ICU) is still a challenge. We designed this retrospective observational study to evaluate the outcomes of palliative care withdrawal from terminal patients in the ICU. Methods: We retrospectively collected data from patients who had consulted the palliative care team for ventilator withdrawal in the ICU. In a 2 -year period, between 2013 and 2014, we reviewed the consultations in the surgical and medical ICU of a medical center. Results: There were 103 consultations for palliative care withdrawal in the ICU during 2013 – 2014. Thirty-seven patients who died within 72 hours after palliative care withdrawal were analyzed. The time to consult the palliative shared care team after admission to the ICU was significantly related to patients who had experienced the procedure of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The time to death after ventilator withdrawal was significantly related to whether “do not resuscitate” had been written. Other factors were not significantly related to the survival time after ventilator removal. Conclusion: In our study, ventilator withdrawal is more acceptable <b>for</b> <b>intensive-care</b> physicians when cardiac arrest had happened previously, and late referral for palliative care is frequently in the ICU. The survival time after ventilator removal was not shorter for those with do not resuscitate status.

40|$|In this study, we {{aimed to}} {{calculate}} device utilization ratios and device-associated infection rates to examine isolated agents and infection control {{measures in the}} Neurology-Neurosurgery Intensive Care Unit (NNICU) of Karadeniz Technical University Faculty of Medicine between January 2007 -December 2008. Patients were followed with active prospective surveillance method by infection control team. The diagnosis of hospital infections {{was based on the}} criteria of Center for Diseases Prevention and Control (CDC). Device-associated infection rates were calculated based on National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System (NNIS) recommendations. The most common device associated infections were ventilator-associated pneumoniae (VAP) and urinary catheter related urinary system infection (UC-USI) in our unit. In 2007 and 2008 years, mechanical ventilatory, central venous catheter and urinary catheter utilization rates were 0. 17 - 0. 28, 0. 25 - 0. 16 and 0. 98 - 0. 95 respectively. Device-associated infection rates at our unit in the following two years were as follows; VAP rates 21 - 24. 3 / 1000 ventilatory days, central venous catheter related blood stream infections (CVC-BSI) 18. 5 - 24. 7 / 1000 central venous catheter days, UC-USI 8. 5 - 2. 6 / 1000 urinary catheter days. Although VAP and CVC-BSI rates were increased markedly, UC-USI rates were decreased by 2008 (p< 0. 05 for all these infections). Acinetobacter spp., Pseudomonas spp. and coagulase negative staphylococcus were the most commonly isolated microorganisms from patients. In order to decrease the device-associated infections, suitable physical environment should be ensured as a priority <b>for</b> <b>intensive-care</b> units. Increased compliance with infection control measures such as handwashing, limitation of invasive-devices utilization and using aseptic techniques in catheterization are some other important approaches...|$|R

40|$|A {{survey of}} the staphylococcal infections {{occurring}} in a general hospital {{over a period of}} {{four and a half years}} showed that multiple-resistant strains of phage type 77 were endemic in the medical and surgical wards. Strains of this phage type were uncommon among patients attending the casualty department, and those found were usually either fully sensitive to antibiotics or resistant to benzylpenicillin only. Regular monitoring of patients admitted to the intensive-care unit showed that 58 % of staphylococcal infections in such patients were present at the time of admission to the unit. Although the wards thus constituted a significant reservoir of infection <b>for</b> the <b>intensive-care</b> unit, there was no evidence to suggest that the return of patients from the unit to the wards was responsible for the transfer of infection in the opposite direction. The possibility of reducing the numbers of multiple-resistant staphylococci in the general wards, by the screening of all new admissions for the presence of tetracycline-resistant strains, appears to be impracticable in this area...|$|R

40|$|Compact analyzers {{suited to}} near-patient testing esti-mate {{hematocrit}} {{by measuring the}} conductivity of undi-luted blood. We evaluated the accuracy of hematocrit determination of one such analyzer (Instrumentation Lab-oratory BGE Analyzer) against an automated cell counter (EPC) and packed cell volume (PCV) microhematocrit. When specimens (n = 34) from outpatient and ward patients were analyzed with all three methods, the BGE analyzer correlated well with both EPC and PCV hemat-ocrit determinations (BGE = 1. 00 PCV + 0. 3 %, S = 1. 6 %; BGE = 1. 04 EPC + 0. 4 %, S, = 2. 0 %), suggest-ing that all three methods are similar in performance for most patients. However, a patient with increased plasma osmolality showed significant decreases in BGE and PCV hematocrits relative to the EPC method. The differences in hematocrit measurements could be reproduced by adding solutes to blood in vitro or by modifying the plasma osmolality of rats in vivo. Samples from patients undergoing cardiac surgery, whose blood had large changes in protein concentration, showed discrepancies between hematocrits by conductivity and other methods; similar effects could be produced by changes in protein concentration or in vitro addition of polyethylene glycol. We conclude that conductivity measurements provide accurate hematocrit results for physiologically normal subjects but not <b>for</b> some <b>intensive-care</b> and surgical patients.

40|$|AbstractAn {{atypical}} pattern of coagulase-negative staphylococcal (CoNS) sepsis, characterized by persistence despite aggressive antibiotic therapy, {{has been described}} in neonates cared <b>for</b> in neonatal <b>intensive-care</b> units. Our aim was to analyse the clinical, microbiological and molecular determinants of this persistent CoNS bacteraemia. Neonates with late-onset CoNS bacteraemia were studied for a 2 -year period. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, microbiological and molecular data were compared between neonates with persistent (≥ 3 consecutive positive blood cultures) and non-persistent CoNS bacteraemia. Twenty-nine infants with persistent and 43 with non-persistent bacteraemia were identified, with no significant differences regarding demographic and clinical characteristics between the two groups. Of a total of 170 CoNS isolates, 80 showed biofilm production (54 persistent and 26 non-persistent; p 0. 013), whereas 127 were positive for the icaA and icaD genes (74 persistent and 53 non-persistent; p 0. 598). Sixty ica-positive isolates did not produce slime, whereas 13 ica-negative isolates showed biofilm production. Endotracheal intubation {{and the presence of}} central vascular catheters were significant risk factors for persistent bacteraemia, but, in a logistic regression model, only biofilm production was significantly related to the persistent form of the disease (p 0. 005). In this study, persistent CoNS sepsis in neonates requiring intensive care was not related to most of the known clinical risk factors, and it was associated with severe thrombocytopenia. Isolates associated with persistent bacteraemia were more likely to produce biofilm, independently of the presence of the ica operon...|$|R
40|$|The {{choice of}} {{empirical}} treatment of nosocomial pneumonia in the <b>intensive-care</b> unit (ICU) <b>used</b> {{to rely on}} the interval after the start of mechanical ventilation. Nowadays, however, the question of whether in fact there is a difference in the distribution of causative pathogens is under debate. Data from 308 ICUs from the German National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System, including information on relevant pathogens isolated in 11, 285 cases of nosocomial pneumonia from 1997 to 2004, were used for our evaluation. Each individual pneumonia case was allocated either to early- or to late-onset pneumonia, with three differentiation criteria: onset on the 4 th day, the 5 th day, or the 7 th day in the ICU. The frequency of pathogens was evaluated according to these categories. A total of 5, 066 additional cases of pneumonia were reported from 2005 to 2006, after the CDC criteria had been modified. From 1997 to 2004, the most frequent microorganisms were Staphylococcus aureus (2, 718 cases, including 720 with methicillin [meticillin]-resistant S. aureus), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1, 837 cases), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1, 305 cases), Escherichia coli (1, 137 cases), Enterobacter spp. (937 cases), streptococci (671 cases), Haemophilus influenzae (509 cases), Acinetobacter spp. (493 cases), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (308 cases). The order of the four most frequent pathogens (accounting for 53. 7 % of all pathogens) was the same in both groups and was independent of the cutoff categories applied: S. aureus was first, followed by P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and E. coli. Thus, the predictabilities of the occurrence of pathogens were similar for the earlier (1997 -to- 2004) and later (2005 -to- 2006) time frames. This classification is no longer helpful for empirical antibiotic therapy, since the pathogens are the same for both groups...|$|R
50|$|By the 1970s, NICUs were an {{established}} part of {{hospitals in the}} developed world. In Britain, some early units ran community programmes, sending experienced nurses to help care for premature babies at home. But increasingly technological monitoring and therapy meant special care for babies became hospital-based. By the 1980s, over 90% of births took place in hospital. The emergency dash from home to the NICU with baby in a transport incubator had become {{a thing of the}} past, though transport incubators were still needed. Specialist equipment and expertise were not available at every hospital, and strong arguments were made for large, centralised NICUs. On the downside was the long travelling time for frail babies and for parents. A 1979 study showed that 20% of babies in NICUs for up to a week were never visited by either parent. Centralised or not, by the 1980s few questioned the role of NICUs in saving babies. Around 80% of babies born weighing less than 1.5 kg now survived, compared to around 40% in the 1960s. From 1982, pediatricians in Britain could train and qualify in the sub-specialty of neonatal medicine.Not only careful nursing but also new techniques and instruments now played a major role. As in adult <b>intensive-care</b> units, the <b>use</b> of monitoring and life-support systems became routine. These needed special modification for small babies, whose bodies were tiny and often immature. Adult ventilators, for example, could damage babies' lungs and gentler techniques with smaller pressure changes were devised. The many tubes and sensors used for monitoring the baby's condition, blood sampling and artificial feeding made some babies scarcely visible beneath the technology. Furthermore, by 1975, over 18% of newborn babies in Britain were being admitted to NICUs. Some hospitals admitted all babies delivered by Caesarian section or under 2500 g in weight. The fact that these babies missed early close contact with their mothers was a growing concern. The 1980s saw questions being raised about the human and economic costs of too much technology, and admission policies gradually became more conservative.|$|R
