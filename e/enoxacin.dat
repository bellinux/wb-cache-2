50|$|After oral {{administration}} <b>enoxacin</b> is rapidly and well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The antibiotic is widely {{distributed throughout the}} body and in the different biological tissues. Tissue concentrations often exceed serum concentrations. The binding of <b>enoxacin</b> to serum proteins is 35 to 40%.The serum elimination half-life, in subjects with normal renal function, is approximately 6 hours. Approximately 60% of an orally administered dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug within 24 hours.A small amount of a dose of drug administered is excreted in the bile. High concentrations of the fluoroquinolone are reached in the urinary tract and this fact ensures an antibacterial effect continued over time, particularly in this district.|$|E

40|$|Ten normal volunteers {{participated in}} a randomized, five-way {{crossover}} study {{to determine the effect}} of concurrent <b>enoxacin</b> and antacid or ranitidine administration on <b>enoxacin</b> absorption. The bioavailability of a single oral 400 -mg <b>enoxacin</b> dose was significantly decreased, by 73 and 49 %, when Maalox TC was administered 0. 5 and 2 h before <b>enoxacin,</b> respectively. <b>Enoxacin</b> bioavailability was not significantly altered when the antacid was given 8 h before or 2 h after <b>enoxacin</b> administration. Ranitidine, administered intravenously 2 h before <b>enoxacin,</b> also significantly decreased <b>enoxacin</b> bioavailability, by 40 %. The correlation between the proximity of antacid administration and the magnitude of the decrease in <b>enoxacin</b> bioavailability supports complexation as the mechanism of the antacid-enoxacin interaction. However, reduction of <b>enoxacin</b> bioavailability by ranitidine suggests that elevated gastric pH may also {{play a role in the}} antacid-enoxacin drug-drug interaction...|$|E
40|$|Several {{methods were}} used to {{determine}} <b>enoxacin</b> uptake in Escherichia coli strains because washing of cells removed all or most cell-associated <b>enoxacin</b> whereas no washing was associated with large amounts of cell-bound <b>enoxacin.</b> Washing after up to 40 to 45 min of exposure to <b>enoxacin</b> followed by suspension in drug-free medium prevented a significant effect of <b>enoxacin</b> on cell growth. Cell uptakes obtained with different methods showed no difference {{in the shape of the}} timed uptake curves but did show significant quantitative differences. These results are consistent with cell-associated <b>enoxacin</b> comprising a freely exchangeable pool of drug. Lineweaver-Burk plots of uptake were consistent with uptake of <b>enoxacin</b> by simple diffusion. No saturability and no competition with ciprofloxacin were observed. Low temperature (4 degrees C) was associated with decreased uptake. Arsenate, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, sodium fluoride, sodium azide, and 2, 4 -dinitrophenol had no effect on uptake. We conclude that the mechanism of transport of <b>enoxacin</b> into cells is by simple diffusion. Mutants of E. coli with deficiency of outer membrane proteins F and C and an enoxacin-resistant mutant selected by serial passage with increasing <b>enoxacin</b> concentrations demonstrated that F porins play a significant role in <b>enoxacin</b> uptake and influence susceptibility to <b>enoxacin.</b> Uptake was shown to be similar in a strain of Bacillus subtilis...|$|E
40|$|This study {{compared}} <b>enoxacin</b> administered orally with cefoperazone administered intramuscularly for {{the treatment}} of Enterobacter aerogenes endocarditis in rabbits. The MICs and MBCs of both <b>enoxacin</b> and cefoperazone for an inoculum of 10 (5) CFU/ml of the E. aerogenes strain used were 0. 8 micrograms/ml, respectively. With an inoculum of 10 (8) organisms per ml, <b>enoxacin</b> at 2 and 5 micrograms/ml and cefoperazone at 60 and 155 micrograms/ml were effective in reducing titers of E. aerogenes in broth. E. aerogenes endocarditis in rabbits was treated with <b>enoxacin</b> (100 or 25 mg/kg orally every 6 h) or cefoperazone (60 mg/kg intramuscularly every 6 h) for 5 or 10 days. <b>Enoxacin</b> at 100 and 25 mg/kg significantly reduced bacterial titers of vegetations compared with those of untreated controls. <b>Enoxacin</b> at 100 mg/kg was significantly more effective than <b>enoxacin</b> at 25 mg/kg and cefoperazone. <b>Enoxacin</b> at 25 mg/kg and cefoperazone did not differ significantly. Cefoperazone and controls did not differ significantly. In uninfected rabbits single doses of cefoperazone achieved much higher concentrations in serum than single doses of <b>enoxacin</b> (25 and 100 mg/kg). The half-lives of <b>enoxacin</b> at 25 and 100 mg/kg were approximately three times longer than that of cefoperazone...|$|E

40|$|In a randomized, {{crossover}} study single 200 and 800 mg doses of <b>enoxacin</b> were administered intravenously and orally to eight healthy normal volunteers. Plasma and urinary <b>enoxacin</b> concentrations and urinary concentrations of its oxo-metabolite {{were determined by}} high-performance liquid chromatography. At {{the end of a}} 1 h intravenous infusion period, mean <b>enoxacin</b> plasma concentrations were 1 - 8 and 6 - 6 mg/ 1 for the 200 and 800 mg doses, respectively. Disappearance of <b>enoxacin</b> from the systemic circulation appeared to follow first order kinetics with harmonic mean elimination half lives of 3 - 3 and 4 - 7 h for the 200 and 800 mg dose groups, respectively. However, <b>enoxacin</b> kinetics were dose-dependent over the dose range tested. Total body clearance decreased and elimination half-life increased with increasing dose. The volume of distribution was large (2 - 8 I/kg) and independent of dose. Absorption of orally administered <b>enoxacin</b> was rapid, with mean peak plasma concentrations (1 - 0 and 3 - 8 rag/ 1) appearing one to two hours postdose. Absolute oral bioavailability averaged 89 %, and was independent of the dose administered. Cumulative <b>enoxacin</b> urinary recovery accounted for 51 - 53 % of the dose irrespective of dose or route of administration. <b>Enoxacin</b> renal clearance exceeded creatinine clearance indicating that urinary excretion of <b>enoxacin</b> involved both glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Urinary excretion of the oxo-metabolite averaged 16 % and 11 % following the 200 and 800 mg dose, respectively. Evidence of dose dependent decrease in <b>enoxacin</b> renal clearance and formation of its oxo-metabolite was observed. <b>Enoxacin</b> was well tolerated {{during the course of the}} trial. The present study shows that <b>enoxacin</b> pharmacokinetics can be characterized by apparent first order elimination, large volume of distribution, and dose-dependent increase of half life.

40|$|Increasing {{resistance}} of Haemophilus ducreyi to antimicrobials necessitates further trials of new antimicrobial agents for treating chancroid. <b>Enoxacin</b> has excellent in vitro activity against H ducreyi, and a randomised clinical trial of three doses of <b>enoxacin</b> 400 mg at intervals of 12 hours {{compared with a}} single dose of trimethoprim/sulphametrole (TMP/SMT) 640 / 3200 mg was therefore conducted. Of 169 men enrolled in the study, 86 received <b>enoxacin</b> and 83 received TMP/SMT. Ulcers were improved or cured in 65 / 73 men treated with <b>enoxacin</b> and 57 / 70 men treated with TMP/SMT. This difference was not significant. At 72 hours after treatment, H ducreyi was eradicated from ulcers of 72 / 77 men treated with <b>enoxacin</b> and of 67 / 74 of those treated with TMP/SMT. Patients with buboes responded equally well to both treatments. Of 100 H ducreyi strains tested, all were susceptible to both 0. 25 mg/l <b>enoxacin</b> and the combination of 0. 25 mg/l TMP and 5 mg/l SMT. Although most men treated with either regimen were cured, neither regimen {{appeared to be the}} optimum treatment for chancroid.

40|$|The skin {{permeation}} and partitioning of a fluorinated quinolone antibacterial agent, <b>enoxacin,</b> in liposomes and niosomes, after topical application, were elucidated in {{the present}} study. In vitro percutaneous absorption experi-ments were performed on nude mouse skin with Franz diffusion cells. The influence of vesicles on the physicochemical property and stability of the formulations were measured. The enhanced delivery across the skin of liposome and niosome encapsulated <b>enoxacin</b> had been observed after selecting the appropriate formulations. The optimized formulations could also reserve {{a large amount of}} <b>enoxacin</b> in the skin. A significant relationship between skin permeation and the cumulative amount of <b>enoxacin</b> in the skin was observed. Both permeation enhancer effect and direct vesicle fusion with stratum corneum may contribute to the permeation of <b>enoxacin</b> across skin. Formulation with niosomes demonstrated a higher stability after 48 h incubation compared to liposomes. The inclusion of cholesterol improved the stability of <b>enoxacin</b> liposomes according to the results from encapsulation and turbidity. However, adding negative charges reduced the stability of niosomes. The ability of liposomes and niosomes to modulate drug delivery without significant toxicity makes the two vesicles useful to formulate topical <b>enoxacin...</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Enoxacin</b> {{administered}} orally {{was compared}} with vancomycin administered intravenously {{for the treatment}} of experimental methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis. The MICs and MBCs of both <b>enoxacin</b> and vancomycin for an inoculum of 5. 0 X 10 (5) CFU of the methicillin-resistant S. aureus strain per ml were 1. 56 microgram/ml. With an inoculum of 10 (8) CFU/ml, <b>enoxacin</b> at 6 micrograms/ml and vancomycin at 180 micrograms/ml resulted in similar decreases in numbers of methicillin-resistant S. aureus in broth. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus endocarditis in rabbits was treated with <b>enoxacin</b> at 100 mg/kg orally every 12 h or vancomycin at 30 mg/kg intravenously every 12 h for 3 or 5 days. <b>Enoxacin</b> treatment for 3 or 5 days and vancomycin treatment for 5 days significantly reduced bacterial counts of vegetations compared with those in untreated control rabbits after 1 day of infection. Bacterial counts of vegetations after vancomycin treatment for 3 days did not differ significantly from those of untreated controls. Bacterial counts of vegetations in the four therapeutic groups did not differ significantly from one another. In uninfected rabbits single doses of vancomycin at 30 mg/kg administered intravenously achieved much higher concentrations in serum than did single doses of <b>enoxacin</b> at 100 mg/kg administered orally. <b>Enoxacin</b> had an elimination half-life in serum that was approximately 1. 5 times longer than that of vancomycin.

40|$|<b>Enoxacin</b> is a {{fluorinated}} quinolone {{with potential}} clinical {{use in the}} treatment of serious infections. Twenty-three patients (age, 19 to 87 years) with different degrees of renal function, including a group undergoing chronic hemodialysis, received <b>enoxacin</b> (400 mg) by intravenous infusion (1 h). Blood samples were collected before infusion; at the end of infusion; and at 5, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min and 3, 4, 6, 12, 18, 24, 48, and 72 h after infusion. <b>Enoxacin</b> and oxoenoxacin concentrations were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Pharmacokinetic parameters (mean +/- standard deviation) were calculated by using a noncompartmental PK model according to creatinine clearances (in milliliters per minute). Total clearance of <b>enoxacin</b> decreased from 4. 95 +/- 1. 16 ml/min per kg in the group with normal creatinine clearance to 0. 76 +/- 0. 21 ml/min per kg in the patients with severe renal failure (creatinine clearance, less than 15 ml/min), whereas the elimination half-life increased from 4. 5 +/- 1. 0 to 20 +/- 5 h, respectively. The elimination of oxoenoxacin (the main metabolite of <b>enoxacin)</b> in urine was markedly decreased when creatinine clearance was less than 15 ml/min. Hemodialysis removed an insignificant amount of <b>enoxacin</b> and oxoenoxacin. These data indicate that as creatinine clearance falls below 30 ml/min, the daily <b>enoxacin</b> dose should be reduced by half. During prolonged administration of <b>enoxacin</b> to patients with creatinine clearances of less than 30 ml/min, the accumulation of oxoenoxacin might lead to unexpected side effects...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of action of quinolones was investigated by use of various DNA gyrases reconstituted from wild-type and mutant GyrA and GyrB proteins of Escherichia coli. The quinolone sensitivities of the DNA supercoiling activity of the gyrases were generally parallel to the quinolone susceptibilities of strains having the corresponding enzymes and depended on gyrase subunits but not on substrate DNA. [3 H]Enoxacin did not bind to gyrase alone or DNA alone but bound to gyrase-DNA complexes when measured by a gel filtration method. There appeared to be two <b>enoxacin</b> binding phases, at low and high <b>enoxacin</b> concentrations, for the wild-type gyrase-DNA and type 2 GyrB (Lys- 447 to Glu) mutant gyrase-DNA complexes but only one <b>enoxacin</b> binding phase at the concentrations used for the GyrA (Ser- 83 to Leu) mutant gyrase-DNA and type 1 GyrB (Asp- 426 to Asn) mutant gyrase-DNA complexes. New <b>enoxacin</b> binding sites appeared {{in the presence of}} <b>enoxacin,</b> and the <b>enoxacin</b> binding affinities for the sites, especially at low <b>enoxacin</b> concentrations, near the MICs for the strains having the corresponding gyrases, correlated well with the <b>enoxacin</b> sensitivities of the gyrases and the MICs. From the results obtained, we propose a quinolone pocket model as the {{mechanism of}} action of quinolones, in which quinolones exert their action through binding to a gyrase-DNA complex and the quinolone binding affinities for the complex are determined by both GyrA and GyrB subunits in concert...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Breast {{cancer is}} the leading cause of cancer in women world wide both in the {{developed}} and developing countries. Thus effective treatment of breast cancer with potential anti-tumor drugs is important. In this study, human breast cancer cell line MCF- 7 has been employed to evaluate the antiproliferative activity of fluoroquinolone antibiotic <b>enoxacin</b> in culture. The present investigation shows that <b>enoxacin</b> induced growth inhibition of MCF- 7 cells at significant level. The growth inhibition is dose dependent, time dependent and irreversible in nature. Increase in population doubling time and decrease in saturation density were also observed in <b>enoxacin</b> treated cells. Growth inhibitory effects were also found to be independent of concentration of serum growth factors in medium. <b>Enoxacin</b> also altered cellular morphology in in vitro culture condition. After <b>enoxacin</b> treatment accumulation of MCF- 7 cells at G 2 /M phase suggested cell cycle arrest and in turn inhibition of cell growth, which needs further investigation. Thus, this study clearly demonstrates that human breast cancer cell MCF- 7 is highly responsive to fluoroquinolone antibiotic <b>enoxacin</b> treatment...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>enoxacin</b> and its {{metabolite}} 4 -oxoenoxacin on {{the disposition of}} theophylline were investigated in rats. Systemic clearance of theophylline was significantly decreased by approximately 40, 46, and 50 % after oral coadministration of 25, 100, and 200 mg of <b>enoxacin</b> per kg, respectively. No {{significant changes in the}} volume of distribution of theophylline were observed. 4 -Oxoenoxacin had no direct effect on theophylline disposition. Significant changes in urinary excretion of theophylline and its metabolites were observed. (i) Urinary excretion of unchanged theophylline was significantly increased in proportion to increases in <b>enoxacin</b> dosage. (ii) Decreases in renal clearance of theophylline and metabolic clearance of 1 -methyluric acid and 1, 3 -dimethyluric acid were observed. (iii) The percent decreases in the metabolic clearance of 1 -methyluric acid were dependent on <b>enoxacin</b> dosage. It is likely that <b>enoxacin</b> inhibits the elimination process, which depends on cytochrome P- 450 -mediated isozymes for N demethylation and oxidation, and that the capacity of the inhibitory effect of <b>enoxacin</b> is greater in the N-demethylation pathway than it is in oxidation...|$|E
40|$|This report {{examines}} {{the effects of}} exposure to <b>enoxacin</b> on interactions of bacteria and neutrophils. Pretreatment of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with x { to x 4 the MIC of <b>enoxacin</b> had no enhancing effect upon phagocytic killing when the antibiotic was not present. Phagocytic killing was synergistically enhanced when <b>enoxacin</b> was continually present although this was not manifested in increased phagocytosis. The enhanced killing was abrogated by disruption of bacterial opsonization, internalization and intraleukocytic killing processes of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. These observations indicate that the synergistic killing of Str. pneumoniae and Ps. aeruginosa by <b>enoxacin</b> and human neutrophils is due to enhanced intracellular killing and not an increase in phagocytosis...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{the results}} of a {{previous}} study which demonstrated a 50 % reduction in theophylline clearance during coadministration of 400 mg of <b>enoxacin</b> twice a day (b. i. d.), a sequential-design study was completed with seven nonsmoking, healthy adult female human volunteers. The subjects were given 200 mg of theophylline (Theo-Dur) orally every 12 h for 4 days. On day 5, the subjects began receiving 400 mg of <b>enoxacin</b> with each theophylline dose, and the dosage of theophylline was reduced to 100 mg b. i. d. This regimen was continued through day 8, after which <b>enoxacin</b> was discontinued. The theophylline dosage was increased to 200 mg b. i. d. on day 9, and theophylline monotherapy continued through day 12. The mean apparent theophylline clearance decreased by approximately 50 % during <b>enoxacin</b> coadministration. No significant differences in mean theophylline maximum concentration in serum, time to maximum concentration in serum, lowest concentration observed, or area under the concentration-time curve during the steady-state dosing were observed before, during, or after <b>enoxacin</b> coadministration when the theophylline dosage was reduced to 100 mg b. i. d. Reduction of the theophylline dose by 50 % at the onset of <b>enoxacin</b> dosing maintained constant theophylline concentrations in plasma. A return to the original theophylline dose immediately upon cessation of <b>enoxacin</b> therapy resulted in a transient 35 % increase in theophylline concentrations in plasma which lasted 24 to 48 h before returning to preenoxacin values. Although a 50 % reduction in the theophylline dose maintained constant mean theophylline concentrations when <b>enoxacin</b> was administered concomitantly, it appears that larger dose reductions (up to 75 %) could be required in patients with high theophylline clearances. In addition, larger transient increases in the theophylline concentration in plasma may be observed in these patients upon cessation of <b>enoxacin</b> therapy if the theophylline dose is immediately returned to normal. Thus, it is recommended that theophylline concentrations in plasma be monitored when concurrent <b>enoxacin</b> therapy is required...|$|E
40|$|<b>Enoxacin</b> {{has been}} {{identified}} as a small molecule inhibitor of binding between the B 2 -subunit of vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) and microfilaments. It inhibits bone resorption by calcitriol-stimulated mouse marrow cultures. We hypothesized that <b>enoxacin</b> acts directly and specifically on osteoclasts by disrupting the interaction between plasma membrane-directed V-ATPases, which contain the osteoclast-selective a 3 -subunit of V-ATPase, and microfilaments. Consistent with this hypothesis, <b>enoxacin</b> dose-dependently reduced the number of multinuclear cells expressing tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity produced by RANK-L-stimulated osteoclast precursors. <b>Enoxacin</b> (50 mu M) did not induce apoptosis as measured by TUNEL and caspase- 3 assays. V-ATPases containing the a 3 -subunit, but not the "housekeeping" a 1 -subunit, were isolated bound to actin. Treatment with <b>enoxacin</b> reduced the association of V-ATPase subunits with the detergent-insoluble cytoskeleton. Quantitative PCR revealed that <b>enoxacin</b> triggered significant reductions in several osteoclast-selective mRNAs, but levels of various osteoclast proteins were not reduced, as determined by quantitative immunoblots, even when their mRNA levels were reduced. Immunoblots demonstrated that proteolytic processing of TRAP 5 b and the cytoskeletal protein L-plastin was altered in cells treated with 50 mu M <b>enoxacin.</b> Flow cytometry revealed that <b>enoxacin</b> treatment favored the expression of high levels of DC-STAMP on the surface of osteoclasts. Our data show that <b>enoxacin</b> directly inhibits osteoclast formation without affecting cell viability by a novel mechanism that involves changes in post-translational processing and trafficking of several proteins with known roles in osteoclast function. We propose that these effects are downstream to blocking the binding interaction between a 3 -containing V-ATPases and microfilaments.

The <b>enoxacin</b> dose in which antacid was coadministered was randomly selected. Fourteen plasma samples were collected over 24 h, and urine was collected in two divided intervals over 48 h. <b>Enoxacin</b> concentrations in plasma and urine samples were determined by high-performance liquid chromatographic assays. The intensive antacid regimen did not change the total clearance (P = 0. 058) or steady-state volume of distribution (P = 0. 516) for <b>enoxacin.</b> However, the nonrenal clearance and half-life were significantly altered (P < 0. 05). The mean nonrenal clearance increased from 13. 27 +/- 3. 33 to 15. 68 +/- 2. 35 liters/h (18. 2 %) following the antacid regimen. This effect of antacid is unlikely to be of clinical significance. <b>Enoxacin</b> may be administered intravenously, but not orally, without regard to antacid treatment...|$|E
