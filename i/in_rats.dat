40|$|Intracellular [Na+] ([Na+]i) is {{centrally}} {{involved in}} regulation of cardiac Ca 2 + and contractility via Na+-Ca 2 + exchange (NCX) and Na+-H+ exchange (NHX). Previous work {{has indicated that}} [Na+]i is higher <b>in</b> <b>rat</b> than rabbit ventricular myocytes. This has major functional consequences, but {{the reason for the}} higher [Na+]i <b>in</b> <b>rat</b> is unknown. Here, resting [Na+]i was measured using the fluorescent indicator SBFI, with both traditional calibration and a novel null-point method (which circumvents many limitations of prior methods). In rabbit, resting [Na+]i was 4. 5 ± 0. 4 mm (traditional calibration) and 4. 4 mm (null-point). Resting [Na+]i <b>in</b> <b>rat</b> was significantly higher using both the traditional calibration (11. 1 ± 0. 7 mm) and the null-point approach (11. 2 mm). The rate of Na+ transport by the Na+ pump was measured as a function of [Na+]i <b>in</b> intact cells. <b>Rat</b> cells exhibited a higher Vmax than rabbit (7. 7 ± 1. 1 vs. 4. 0 ± 0. 5 mm min− 1) and a higher Km (10. 2 ± 1. 2 vs. 7. 5 ± 1. 1 mm). This results in little difference in pump activity for a given [Na+]i below 10 mm, but at measured resting [Na+]i levels the pump-mediated Na+ efflux is much higher <b>in</b> <b>rat.</b> Thus, Na+ pump rate cannot explain the higher [Na+]i <b>in</b> <b>rat.</b> Resting Na+ influx rate was two to four times higher <b>in</b> <b>rat,</b> and this accounts for the higher resting [Na+]i. Using tetrodotoxin, HOE- 642 and Ni 2 + to block Na+ channels, NHX and NCX, respectively, we found that all three pathways may contribute to the higher resting Na+ influx <b>in</b> <b>rat</b> (albeit differentially). We conclude that resting [Na+]i is higher <b>in</b> <b>rat</b> than <b>in</b> rabbit, that this is caused by higher resting Na+ influx <b>in</b> <b>rat</b> and that a higher Na+,K+-ATPase pumping rate <b>in</b> <b>rat</b> is a consequence of the higher [Na+]i...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine whether flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) protein was {{expressed}} <b>in</b> cultured <b>rat</b> brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs), which constitute the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and whether N -oxide from the tertiary amine, d -chlorpheniramine, was formed by FMO <b>in</b> <b>rat</b> BMECs. BMECs were isolated and cultured from the brains of three-week-old male Wistar rats. The expression of FMO 1, FMO 2 and FMO 5 proteins was confirmed <b>in</b> <b>rat</b> BMECs by western blotting analysis using polyclonal anti-FMO antibodies, but FMO 3 and FMO 4 proteins were not found <b>in</b> the <b>rat</b> BBB. Moreover, N -oxide of d -chlorpheniramine was formed <b>in</b> <b>rat</b> BMECs. The intrinsic clearance value for N -oxidation at pH 8. 4 was higher than that at pH 7. 4. Inhibition of N -oxide formation by methimazole was found to be the best model of competitive inhibition yielding an apparent K i value of 0. 53 μ mol/L, suggesting that N -oxidation was catalyzed by FMOs <b>in</b> <b>rat</b> BMECs. Although FMO activity <b>in</b> <b>rat</b> BMECs was lower than that <b>in</b> SD <b>rat</b> normal hepatocytes (rtNHeps), we suggest that rat BMECs enzymes can convert substrates of exogenous origin for detoxification, indicating that BMECs are an important barrier for metabolic products besides hepatic cells. </span...|$|R
