25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, when {{automobiles}} were still new technology, their production levels were low {{enough that they}} could be shipped in sufficient quantities in boxcars. Two to four automobiles would usually fit into one boxcar. But as the automobile industry grew in size, railroads found that they needed to modify the boxcars for more efficient loading. Some modifications included longer boxcars, larger sliding <b>double</b> <b>side</b> doors located near one end of the boxcar, or doors located on the boxcar ends.|$|E

40|$|We have {{successfully}} synthesized highly dense and well aligned zinc oxide nanowires (NWs) {{on the two}} sides of a PEDOT: PSS substrate by a single step low temperature hydrothermal method. The grown sample was used to fabricate a <b>double</b> <b>sided</b> piezoelectric nanogenerator (NG). The maximum harvested output power density from the fabricated <b>double</b> <b>sided</b> NG configuration was about 4. 44 mW cm(- 2). The results obtained from the present <b>double</b> <b>sided</b> NG were approximately double the output from a single side. In addition to that, the voltage polarity of the harvested voltage from {{the two sides of}} the NG has been investigated. The results showed that upon bending, an anisotropic voltage polarity is generated on the two sides. Indicating that, this <b>double</b> <b>sided</b> NG can be used as a self-powered voltage polarity based direction sensor. The results of the present flexible <b>double</b> <b>sided</b> NG is very promising for harvesting energy from irregular mechanical energy sources in the surrounding environment. In addition, the fabricated configuration showed stability for sensing and can be used in surveillance and security applications.
