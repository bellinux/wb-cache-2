5|$|Major {{depressive}} disorder (MDD), {{also known}} simply as depression, is a mental disorder characterized by {{at least two weeks}} of low mood that is present across most situations. It is often accompanied by low self-esteem, loss of interest in normally enjoyable activities, low energy, and pain without a clear cause. People may also occasionally have false beliefs or see or <b>hear</b> <b>things</b> that others cannot. Some people have periods of depression separated by years in which they are normal while others nearly always have symptoms present. Major depressive disorder can negatively affect a person's personal, work, or school life, as well as sleeping, eating habits, and general health. Between 2–7% of adults with major depression die by suicide, and up to 60% of people who die by suicide had depression or another mood disorder.|$|E

The authors question how accurately the reasonable suspicion test reflects the public's perspective, given that the test requires the court {{to look through the}} eyes of a reasonable observer in court who is familiar with the relevant facts, whereas most members of the public <b>hear</b> <b>things</b> from secondary sources.|$|E
25|$|Delirium tremens (DTs) is a rapid {{onset of}} {{confusion}} usually caused by withdrawal from alcohol. When it occurs, {{it is often}} three days into the withdrawal symptoms and lasts {{for two to three}} days. Physical effects may include shaking, shivering, irregular heart rate, and sweating. People may also see or <b>hear</b> <b>things</b> other people do not. Occasionally, a very high body temperature or seizures may result in death. Alcohol {{is one of the most}} dangerous drugs from which to withdraw.|$|E

500|$|Beyoncé first {{considered}} {{the idea of}} creating a [...] "visual album" [...] in June 2013, when only three or four songs had been completed. Explaining her motivation, she said she would often connect images, childhood memories, emotions and fantasies to songs she {{was in the midst of}} composing, and that she [...] "wanted people to hear the songs with the story that's in my head as that's what makes it mine". She highlighted the [...] "immersive experience" [...] of Michael Jackson's Thriller (1982) as the principal influence for creating a body work that would mean [...] "people would <b>hear</b> <b>things</b> differently and [...] actually be able to see the whole vision of the album".|$|E
500|$|Modal jazz of {{this type}} was not unique to this album. Davis himself had {{previously}} used the same method on his 1958 Milestones album, the 58 Sessions, and Porgy and Bess (1958), on which he used modal influences for collaborator Gil Evans's third stream compositions. Also, the original concept and method had been developed in 1953 by pianist and writer George Russell. Davis saw Russell's methods of composition {{as a means of}} getting away from the dense chord-laden compositions of his time, which Davis had labeled [...] "thick." [...] Modal composition, with its reliance on scales and modes, represented, as Davis called it, [...] "a return to melody." [...] In a 1958 interview with Nat Hentoff of The Jazz Review, Davis elaborated on this form of composition in contrast to the chord progression predominant in bebop, stating [...] "No chords ... gives you a lot more freedom and space to <b>hear</b> <b>things.</b> When you go this way, you can go on forever. You don't have to worry about changes and you can do more with the [...] line. It becomes a challenge to see how melodically innovative you can be. When you're based on chords, you know at the end of 32 bars that the chords have run out and there's nothing to do but repeat what you've just done—with variations. I think a movement in jazz is beginning away from the conventional string of chords... there will be fewer chords but infinite possibilities as to what to do with them." ...|$|E

2500|$|What to Do When You Are Dead was {{recorded}} between August and October 2004 at Water Music and The Machine Shop in Hoboken, New Jersey. Producer duties were handled by Machine. While making the album, frontman Ben Jorgensen analysed Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon (1973). He recorded his rhythm part first, followed by drums, then guitarist PJ Decicco tracked his lead parts and additional rhythm parts, {{ending with the}} bass lines. [...] Decicco said that Machine felt that the bass needed to be recorded last because it [...] "sometimes goes out of tune more so he has more of a reference to kind of <b>hear</b> <b>things</b> if he has them with the guitars already".|$|E

2500|$|... (12 June 2008) We {{completed}} our 2008 {{effort to}} get definitive evidence for ivorybills in the Choctawhatchee River Basin in early May…. Team members had no sightings of ivorybills and only two sound detections in 2008.… So where does all this leave us? Pretty much {{in the same position}} as in June 2006. We have a large body of evidence that Ivory-billed Woodpeckers persist along the Choctawhatchee River in the Florida panhandle, but we do not have definitive proof that they exist. Either the excitement of the ivorybill hunt causes competent birders to see and <b>hear</b> <b>things</b> that do not exist and leads competent sound analysts to misidentify hundreds of recorded sounds, or the few ivorybills in the Choctawhatchee River Basin are among the most elusive birds on the planet.|$|E
2500|$|The Fourth Apprentice {{takes place}} {{approximately}} {{six months after}} the end of Sunrise, during the summer, when the four Clans are suffering due to a drought. In ThunderClan, sisters Dovekit and [...] Ivykit become apprentices with Lionblaze as Dovepaw's mentor and [...] Cinderheart as Ivypaw's. While out in the forest, Dovepaw speaks of seeing brown animals (beavers) up the river building a dam, causing the drought, but no other cat believes her. Lionblaze realizes that Dovepaw is one of the Three foretold in the prophecy [...] "There will be three, kin of your kin, who hold the power of the stars in their paws", of which he and his brother Jayfeather are also a part. They each have a special power, and he realizes that Dovepaw's is the ability to see and <b>hear</b> <b>things</b> very far away, i.e., clairvoyance.|$|E
2500|$|After {{recording}} {{her third}} studio album, As I Am, Keys began to [...] "find {{the way to}} totally be myself and what that meant; figuring out what choices I wanted to make and not make in order to truly honor myself". She described The Element of Freedom as diverse, but noted {{that there is a}} [...] "balance". She explained that [...] "one side is strong and one side is vulnerable", which she pointed to as the theme of the album. The album has a [...] "strong, edgy feel", but is also [...] "intimate and vulnerable and delicate". While on BET's 106 & Park, she described the album: [...] "The way that the songs progress [...] are gonna take you on a natural high. I just want you to feel a sense of freedom, I want you to feel out-of-the-box, feel inspired, You're definitely going to be taken on a trip, I know you're going to be shocked, you're going to <b>hear</b> <b>things</b> that you probably didn't think that I would sound like. It's a journey." [...] Keys revealed to The Times that in the period she was recording the album, she listened to artists such as Genesis, Tears for Fears, Fleetwood Mac and The Police.|$|E
