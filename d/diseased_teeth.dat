40|$|Periodontal {{disease is}} a common cause of tooth loss in adults. The {{severity}} of periodontal disease is usually quantified based upon the magnitudes of several tooth-level clinical parameters, {{the most common of}} which is clinical attachment level (CAL). Re- cent clinical studies have presented data on the distribution of periodontal disease in hopes of providing information for localized treatments that can reduce the prevalence of periodontal disease. However, these findings have been descriptive without consid- eration of statistical modeling for estimation and inference. To this end, we visualize the mouth as a circle and the teeth as points located on the circumference of the circle to allow the use of circular statistical methods to determine the mean location of <b>diseased</b> <b>teeth.</b> We assume the directions of <b>diseased</b> <b>teeth,</b> as determined by their tooth averaged CAL values, to be observations from a von Mises distribution, the mean of which is a function of mouth-level covariates.

50|$|Historically, dental extractions {{have been}} used to treat a variety of illnesses. Before the {{discovery}} of antibiotics, chronic tooth infections were often linked to a variety of health problems, and therefore removal of a <b>diseased</b> <b>tooth</b> was a common treatment for various medical conditions. Instruments used for dental extractions date back several centuries. In the 14th century, Guy de Chauliac invented the dental pelican, which was used through the late 18th century. The pelican was replaced by the dental key which, in turn, was replaced by modern forceps in the 20th century. As dental extractions can vary tremendously in difficulty, depending on the patient and the tooth, a wide variety of instruments exist to address specific situations.

Lipopoly-saccharide (LPS) and lipid A, lipoprotein, fimbriae, and phosphorylated dihydroceramides of P. gingivalis have been reported to activate host cell responses through engagement of TLR 2. LPS and lipid A are the most controversial in this regard because con-flicting evidence has been reported concerning the capacity of P. gingivalis LPS or lipid A to engage TLR 2 versus TLR 4. In the present study, we first prepared P. gingivalis LPS by the Tri-Reagent method and evaluated this isolate for contamination with phosphorylated dihydroceramide lipids. Next, the lipid A prepared from this LPS was evaluated for the presence of phosphory-lated dihydroceramide lipids. Finally, we characterized the lipid A by the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionizationmass spec-trometry (MALDI-MS) and electrospray-MSmethods in order to quantify recovery of lipid A in lipid extracts from <b>diseased</b> <b>teeth</b> or subgingival plaque samples.

Furthermore, the lipid extracts derived from <b>diseased</b> <b>teeth</b> or subgingi-val plaque do not contain free lipid A constituents of P. gingivalis but contain substantial amounts of phosphorylated dihydro-ceramide lipids.

40|$|Copyright © 2006 American Academy of PeriodontologyBACKGROUND: Periodontal {{disease is}} marked by {{inflammation}} and damage to tooth-supporting tissues. In particular, damage occurs to factors present in cementum that {{are thought to have}} the ability to influence the regeneration of surrounding tissues. Bone sialoprotein and osteopontin are major non-collagenous proteins in mineralized connective tissues associated with precementoblast chemo-attraction, adhesion to the root surface, and cell differentiation. The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether the expression and distribution of bone sialoprotein and osteopontin on root surfaces affected by periodontitis are altered compared to healthy, non-diseased root surfaces. METHODS: Thirty healthy and 30 periodontitis-affected teeth were collected. Following fixation and demineralization, specimens were embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and exposed to antibodies against bone sialoprotein and osteopontin. Stained sections were assessed using light microscopy. RESULTS: Bone sialoprotein was not detected in the exposed cementum (absence of overlying periodontal ligament) of <b>diseased</b> <b>teeth.</b> In most areas where the periodontal ligament was intact, bone sialoprotein was detected for healthy and <b>diseased</b> <b>teeth.</b> For teeth reactive for bone sialoprotein, the matrix of the cementum just below the periodontal ligament was moderately stained. A similar immunoreactivity pattern for osteopontin was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of bone sialoprotein and osteopontin staining along exposed cementum surfaces may be due to structural and compositional changes in matrix components associated with periodontal disease. This may influence the ability for regeneration and new connective tissue attachment onto previously diseased root surfaces. Martin Lao, ­Victor Marino, and ­P. Mark Bartol...|$|E

30|$|There is {{considerable}} evidence supporting {{the view that}} peri-implant diseases are infectious in nature and mainly linked to an uncontrolled accumulation of bacterial plaque biofilms [1].

40|$|The {{development}} of diagnostic tests for a periodontal infection raises {{the issue as}} to what the appropriate reference standard, or "gold standard," should be for the evaluation of a new test. The present research was initiated to compare the ability of several detection methods, i. e., a serial dilution anaerobic culture and/or microscopic procedure, a DNA probe procedure, and immunological reagents using both an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and an indirect immunofluorescence assay to detect Treponema denticola, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in subgingival plaque samples taken from 204 periodontally <b>diseased</b> <b>tooth</b> sites. The prevalence of the four monitored species varied as a function of both the species and the detection method. Spirochetes were present in 99 % of the plaques, whereas A. actinomycetemcomitans was detected at the lowest frequency. The culture method yielded the lowest prevalence values for the three cultivable species. This raised the question as to which results, those obtained by culture or those obtained by the DNA probes and the immunological reagents, were the most reliable. This issue was addressed by looking at the prevalence profile of the monitored organisms, as determined by all the detection methods. If the species was detected by three or four of the detection methods, then it was considered present, whereas if it was absent by three or four of the detection methods, then it was considered absent. This approach showed the DNA probes and immunological reagents to be significantly superior (P less than 0. 05) to the culture approach for the detection of P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and B. forsythus and to be comparable to the microscopic approach in the detection of T. denticola...|$|R

In restorative dentistry, {{the study of the}} surface properties of materials meant to replace dental tissues in an irreversibly <b>diseased</b> <b>tooth</b> is important to avoid harmful changes in future treatments. We have experimentally analyzed the surface characterization parameters of two different types of dental-resin composites and pre-sintered and sintered zirconia ceramics. We studied two shades of both composite types and two sintered zirconia ceramics: colored and uncolored. Moreover, a surface treatment was applied to one specimen of each dental-resin. All the samples were submitted to rugometric and microtopographic non-invasive inspection with the MICROTOP. 06. MFC laser microtopographer in order to gather meaningful statistical parameters such as the average roughness (Ra), the root-mean-square deviation (Rq), the skewness (Rsk), and the kurtosis of the surface height distribution (Rku). For a comparison of the different biomaterials, the uncertainties associated to the surface parameters were also determined. With respect to Ra and Rq, significant differences between the composite shades were found. Among the dental resins, the nanocomposite presented the highest values and, for the zirconia ceramics, the pre-sintered sample registered the lowest ones. The composite performance may have been due to clusterformation variations. Except for the composites with the surface treatment, the sample surfaces had approximately a normal distribution of heights. The surface treatment applied to the composites increased the average roughness and moved the height distribution farther away from the normal distribution. The zirconia-sintering process resulted in higher average roughness without affecting the height distribution.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{prevalence}} {{and levels of}} six bacterial pathogens within the subgingival/submucosal microbiota at teeth versus implants with various clinical conditions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-two Chinese were included. Four subgingival/submucosal sites were selected for microbiological sampling within each subject, that is, (1) healthy peri-implant tissues; (2) peri-implantitis [PPD ≥ 5 mm, presence of bleeding on probing (BOP) and confirmed radiographic bone loss]; (3) healthy gingiva; and (4) periodontitis (PPD ≥ 4 mm). Subgingival/submucosal plaque was sampled using paper points. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) was used to quantify six pathogens, including Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. g.), Treponema denticola (T. d.), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (A. a.), Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. n.), Prevotella intermedia (P. i.), and Staphylococcus aureus (S. a.). Counts were log 10 -transformed. RESULTS: The most commonly detected species were S. a. and F. n., while A. a. and. P. i. had the lowest detection frequency. The detection frequencies of <b>diseased</b> <b>tooth</b> or implant sites {{for each of the}} six target species were either equal to or higher than the respective frequencies at the corresponding healthy sites. There were no statistically significant differences for any of the species or clinical sites (P > 0. 05, Cochran's Q test). No statistically significant differences in the bacterial loads were found among the four clinical sites; with the exception of F. nucleatum. This was more abundant in periodontitis sites (P = 0. 023, Friedman's 2 -way anova). Both periodontal and peri-implant sites, irrespective of their health status, were revealed to harbor S. aureus cells. The log 10 -transformed loads of S. aureus were approximately 3. 5 within each of the clinical sites (P = 0. 232). This was the highest of the six species analyzed.

To understand the effect of fluorosis on periodontal healing, the initial step during healing, such as fibroblast attachment to the root surface, needs to be evaluated. Hence, the objective {{of the present study was}} to study the attachment of fluorosed fibroblasts on the fluorosed and nonfluorosed root fragments. Materials and Methods: A total of 56 fluorosed and nonfluorosed, periodontally healthy and <b>diseased</b> <b>tooth</b> roots were obtained and allotted to eight groups: Fluorosed and nonfluorosed healthy controls (FH and NFH, respectively), fluorosed and nonfluorosed diseased controls (FD and NFD, respectively), fluorosed and nonfluorosed roots treated with scaling and root planing (FD + S and NFD + S, respectively), and similar groups treated with scaling and root planing and 24 % ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) gel application for 2 min (FD + SE and NFD + SE, respectively). After the respective treatment, the root fragments were incubated in the human periodontal ligament fibroblast cells obtained and cultured from freshly extracted healthy human fluorosed premolar tooth root. Results: In the nonfluorosed roots category, greater attachment was found in the untreated nonfluorosed diseased (P = 0. 036) and SRP-treated nonfluorosed diseased groups (P = 0. 008) as compared to the nonfluorosed healthy group. While in the fluorosed roots category, no significant difference was observed in FL-FA (P > 0. 05) within the group. However, no attachment was observed in EDTA-treated fluorosed root fragments. When fluorosed groups were compared to nonfluorosed groups, no significant changes were noted between the groups. Conclusion: SRP proves to be a standard requirement for fibroblast attachment to occur both in fluorosed and nonfluorosed roots. Although there was no significant difference in attachment between SRP and SRP + EDTA among fluorosed roots, EDTA does not seem to be a promising agent for root biomodification in fluorosed roots in a given concentration and time of treatment...|$|R

Materials and Methods: A total of 112 fluorosed and nonfluorosed, periodontally healthy and <b>diseased</b> <b>tooth</b> roots were obtained and allotted to eight groups : f 0 luorosed healthy (FH) and non-FH (NFH) controls, fluorosed diseased (FD) and non-FD (NFD) controls, fluorosed and nonfluorosed teeth treated with scaling and root planning (SRP) (FD SRP and NFD SRP) and similar groups treated with SRP and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (FD SRP + EDTA and NFD SRP + EDTA) burnishing treatment with 24 % EDTA gel for 2 min. After the respective treatment half of the root fragments in each group were incubated in the human periodontal ligament fibroblast cells obtained and cultured from freshly extracted FH and NFH human premolar tooth root. The nonfluorosed fibroblasts are elongated, flat cells thus they show increased attachment to root the surface. Results: When comparison was carried out between the attachment of fluorosed and nonfluorosed fibroblasts on NFD groups treated with scaling and EDTA, significant results were obtained with increased attachment seen on the group incubated with nonfluorosed fibroblasts (P = 0. 029). While on comparison between the attachment of fluorosed and nonfluorosed fibroblasts on NFH group, NFD group treated with SRP and NFD group, no significant results were obtained (P > 0. 05). On comparison between the attachment of fluorosed and nonfluorosed fibroblasts on FD group treated with SRP, highly significant results were obtained with increased attachment seen in the group incubated with nonfluorosed fibroblasts (P = 0. 001). While the comparison of attachment of fluorosed and nonfluorosed fibroblasts on FH group, FD group treated with SRP + EDTA and FD group revealed no significant results (P > 0. 05). Interpretation and Conclusion: SRP proves yet to be a standard requirement for fibroblast attachment to occur both in fluorosed and nonfluorosed teeth. Although, there is no significant difference in attachment between SRP and SRP + EDTA among fluorosed teeth, EDTA {{does not seem to be}} a promising agent for root biomodification in fluorosed teeth in given concentration and time of treatment...|$|R
