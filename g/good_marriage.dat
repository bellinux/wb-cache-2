5|$|In 1646–47, Ashmole {{made several}} {{simultaneous}} approaches to rich widows {{in the hope}} of securing a <b>good</b> <b>marriage.</b> In 1649, he married Mary, Lady Mainwaring (daughter of Sir William Forster of Aldermaston), a wealthy thrice-widowed woman twenty years his senior; she may have been a relative by marriage of his first wife's family and was the mother of grown children. The marriage took place despite the opposition of the bride's family, and it did not prove to be harmonious: Lady Mainwaring filed suit for separation and alimony but it was dismissed by the courts in 1657. Nevertheless, the marriage provided Ashmole with Mary's first husband's estates centred on Bradfield in Berkshire which left him wealthy enough to pursue his interests, including botany and alchemy, without concern for having to earn a living. He arranged for his friend Wharton to be released from prison and appointed him to manage the estates.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a {{young woman}} named Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss) begins a new career at Sterling Cooper as Don's secretary. She is excited {{to be working in}} Manhattan, but finds herself {{overwhelmed}} by her new surroundings. The office manager, Joan Holloway (Christina Hendricks), a voluptuously beautiful and capable woman, proves more intimidating than helpful as she gives advice on how to be appealing to the men of the office and how that will lead to both success in the office and a <b>good</b> <b>marriage.</b> Peggy is dismayed to find a secretary in the bathroom crying. A junior account executive named Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser) makes boorish comments about Peggy's appearance and clothing, causing Don to rebuke him. On her break, Peggy goes to the office of a doctor recommended by the all-knowing Joan, where she gets a prescription for the recently introduced birth control pill, which at the time was not supposed to be prescribed to unmarried women or married women without their husband's consent. Later in the day, Peggy makes a subtle, sexually inviting gesture to Don, but he definitively rejects her advances.|$|E
5|$|The band began {{production}} on Parachutes in late 1999, after producing & releasing The Blue Room EP with British record producer Chris Allison. Allison {{was asked to}} assist with production, and the band's musical direction, which was desired by both the band & the A department. Production started with the track 'High Speed', {{which was part of}} the EP and was later re-released as a part of Parachutes. Allison describes 'High Speed' as thus: 'You'll notice it is quite a bit different to the other tracks, because there are other sounds going on in it: we wanted to mix a soundscape in with the classic rock sound on that particular track. I thought 'High Speed' was a really <b>good</b> <b>marriage</b> between the classic rock sound and the new sound that was developing out of it, something that was more atmospheric'. Seven tracks in all were recorded during the sessions at Orinoco studios in London, with three of them ending up on The Blue Room EP.|$|E

5|$|He had eleven known children, all by Elizabeth. His eldest son, and heir, John, Earl of Lincoln (c. 1462–16 June 1487), eventually, due to King Richard III {{losing his}} own son, became heir to his {{maternal}} uncle's throne. Following Richard's death at Bosworth Field, Lincoln rebelled {{against the new}} king Henry VII, and himself was killed at the Battle of Stoke. John de la Pole's second son, Geoffrey, was born circa 1464, but died young. Next, Edward (1466–1485) joined the church and became Archdeacon of Richmond. John de la Pole's first daughter, Elizabeth (c. 1468–1489), married Henry Lovel, 8th Baron Morley (1466–1489), and had no issue. John's dukedom descended to his fourth son, Edmund (1471–30 April 1513), who had to bargain energetically with the king and pay a substantial amount before it was granted. He eventually became a Yorkist pretender to Henry VIII's crown, who had him beheaded. Another daughter, Dorothy, {{who was born in}} 1472, died young, whilst next, Humphrey (1474–1513) took Holy Orders, while Anne (1476–1495) became a nun. John's final daughter, Katherine (c. 1477–1513), made a <b>good</b> <b>marriage</b> to William, Baron Stourton, with whom she had no issue. John de la Pole's two youngest sons both seem to have been involved in a plot against Henry VII that was discovered in 1501. Sir William de la Pole, of Wingfield Castle (1478–1539) was imprisoned in the Tower of London, for thirty-seven years. Before this he had married Katherine Stourton; she was twenty years older than him, and they had no issue. The youngest son, Richard de la Pole (1480–1525), managed to escape to France on the discovery of the 1501 plot. Taking part in France's campaigns during the Italian Wars, he was killed at the Battle of Pavia, 24 February 1525.|$|E

25|$|Mrs Broad is {{the owner}} and keeper of The Grapes, a {{comfortable}} inn in the Liberties of the Savoy, where Stephen often stays when in London after finding it in Post Captain as a refuge from debt collectors for Aubrey. Mrs. Broad looks after Stephen as best as she can, and tolerates his habitual untidiness, and his habit of dissecting dead animals and human corpses in the inn premises. She has a daughter, Lucy, who assists her in running The Grapes. She appears in The Ionian Mission, when Villiers and Maturin realize a <b>good</b> <b>marriage</b> for them means separate homes, and Maturin settles again into The Grapes. In The Reverse of the Medal, her inn has {{burned to the ground}} and is not yet rebuilt, so Maturin stays in his club, Blacks. In The Letter of Marque, The Grapes is nearly rebuilt, and Mrs. Broad is again watching over Maturin. At the start of The Commodore, Maturin brings Sarah and Emily Sweetings to Mrs Broad, in hopes they will learn useful social ways in England, as they cannot sail in the squadron.|$|E
25|$|Charles Pouch-Lafarge was a big, coarse man of twenty-eight, {{a son of}} Jean-Baptiste Lafarge, {{justice of}} the peace in Vigeois. In 1817, his father bought the former charterhouse, or Carthusian monastery, in the hamlet of Le Glandier in Corrèze, run by Carthusian monks since the 13th century, but fallen into {{disrepair}} after its suppression in the French Revolution. In an effort to make it profitable, Charles turned part of the estate into a foundry, a venture that plunged him into debt. In 1839, bankrupt, he saw a <b>good</b> <b>marriage</b> as the only way to pay his creditors. He engaged the same marriage broker who was hired to find a husband for Marie. Charles advertised himself as a wealthy iron master with property worth more than 200,000 francs with an annual income of 30,000 from the foundry alone. He also carried letters of recommendation from his priest and local deputy. To hide the fact that a marriage broker was involved in this, Marie's uncle passed off Charles as a friend and arranged a fortuitous meeting with Marie at the opera. Marie found Charles common and repulsive, but since he advertised himself as the owner of a palatial estate, she agreed to marry him. Thus, four days after the meeting, her aunt announced their engagement, and they were married on 10 August 1839. The couple then left Paris for Le Glandier to live at the estate.|$|E

We say that a mechanism (game form) is normal if at any action profile, an agent who obtains his endowments neither pays nor receives a positive amount. In the context of auctions, this simply means that losers receive no bill. We prove that for any normal mechanism, if its Nash equilibrium allocations are Pareto efficient for all preference profiles, then the equilibrium allocations are necessarily in the core. The result holds for a large class of allocation problems in which monetary transfers are feasible and the consumption space is discrete except for the space of transfers. Examples include auctions with any number of objects, economies with indivisible public <b>goods,</b> <b>marriage</b> problems, and coalition formation...|$|R
