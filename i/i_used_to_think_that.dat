25|$|I was {{lobbying}} at the Council of Europe and at Parliament; I {{was over}} in Washington, in Jo'burg, in South America. It was 'let's get guns for the Contras', that sort of stuff. I was enjoying it immensely, I got to go with these guys and fire off AK-47s. I always like to go where the action is, and for that period in the Reagan/Thatcher days, it was great fun, it was all expenses paid and I {{got to see the}} world. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> World Briefing was a bit funny. The only scary thing about those publications was the mailing listpeople like George Bushand the fact that Hart would talk to the head of British Intelligence for an hour. I used to think it was us having a laugh, putting some loony right-wing sell in, and that somebody somewhere was taking it seriously. You've got to understand that we had a sense of humour about this.|$|E
2500|$|At {{this time}} Kossowski began to pray, [...] " [...] … because when I was so deep in this {{calamity}} and nearly dead I promised myself that if I {{came out of}} this subhuman land I would tender my thanks to God. I hesitate to call it a vow, it was rather a promise to myself but later <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it was my obligation …" ...|$|E
2500|$|Bublé had {{a strong}} passion for ice hockey and {{wanted to become a}} {{professional}} hockey player for the Vancouver Canucks growing up, but he believed he wasn't good enough. [...] "I wanted so bad to be a hockey player... If I was any good at hockey, I probably wouldn't be singing right now." [...] He often played hockey in his youth, watched Vancouver Canucks games with his father, and said that he [...] "went to every single home game as a kid... I remember I wanted to be Gary Lupul, I wanted to be Patrik Sundstrom and Ivan Hlinka. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> being named Michael Bublé was pretty cool because I was close to being called Jiri Bubla." [...] Bublé shared his hockey interest with his grandfather.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're right, Fred. D'you know, {{it strikes}} me that I'm a far more selfish and despicable brute than <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, sir! <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> so myself, once,' said Mark. 'But I ain't {{so clear}} about it now. A dear, sweet creetur, sir!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But wasn't it wretched in prison? Wasn't it miserably cold? <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of you {{of nights}} in some wretched ill-aired cell.... You...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Over {{this woman}} question. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> a woman must inevitably lose {{something}} of her charm if {{she took up}} such studies." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I can {{see through}} a {{millstone}} as well as another,' said the captain; 'and <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Norman and Gertrude meant to hit it off together.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'How sweet {{it is to}} {{hear you}} say so! And the {{wonderful}} thing is that you have never seemed disappointed. I always expected that some day after marriage--not immediately, perhaps, {{but at the end of}} a week or so--you would suddenly give a start, like those poor people who are hypnotised, and you would say, [...] "Why, <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> she was pretty! <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> she was sweet! How could I be so infatuated over a little, insignificant, ignorant, selfish, uninteresting--" [...] O Frank, the neighbours will see you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{remember}} <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{you rather}} wild and shy; {{but it is}} difficult now to imagine you a romp," [...] said Gwendolen, smiling.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Pretty! I {{have seen}} {{the women of the}} round world--before I went to--well, never mind where, <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> the Poles the most magnificent, but she--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{you call}} {{yourself}} his friend! His friend!" [...] (Metallic laugh, most unpleasant.) [...] "It shows how one can be deceived. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> you a kind-hearted man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Justly judged! I {{shall have}} enough of him by and by, if I take him out to Canada. Once <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> would be deliverance; now it has become nothing but a {{gigantic}} trouble!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But man {{is never}} satisfied. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> when I got you spliced, I should have {{nothing else to}} wish for; but now I'm {{beginning}} to want little grandsons to rock upon my knees." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think so. He always scolded me. He did {{not like}} me. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I would go away and leave him. I wish that I had never come to Llanfeare. I do;--I do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{look at me}} that way! You {{have n't}} {{advanced}} so rapidly as <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> you would; you haven't distinguished yourself so much," [...] she went on, irrelevantly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, ay!" [...] {{said the}} doctor, [...] "there's {{much more in}} the boy than <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think.</b> He's a capital fellow, and more like his mother than any of them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because {{you have}} a spite against Carson, and you wish to get him into trouble. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> you a fair and square man, Hardwick, but I find I am mistaken." ...|$|R
60|$|Years ago <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it was {{responsible}} for nearly all of it, but latterly I have come {{to think that this}} was an error. Indeed, it is now my conviction that it is responsible for hardly any of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is giving}} up {{almost too much}} to our amusements. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I should like to move for a return {{of the number of}} hunting and {{shooting}} gentlemen in both Houses. I believe it would be a small minority." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{it is no}} {{dream to}} me, Felix;--or if so, I {{do not mean to}} wake any more. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I should never care very much for anybody out of my own family;--but now--" [...] And she then pressed her little hand upon his arm.|$|E
60|$|LADY A. Oh! Why did I {{ever ask}} that wretch De Levis? <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> him pathetic. Meg did you know----Ronald Dancy's coat was wet? The General {{happened}} to feel it.|$|R
60|$|LARRY. He's not {{the same}} <b>to</b> me. He <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be very civil to Master Larry: a deal too civil, <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think.</b> Now he's as surly and {{stand-off}} as a bear.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes. But worldly {{advantage}} from an art doesn't {{depend upon}} mastering it. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> it did; but it doesn't. Those who get rich need have no skill {{at all as}} artists.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish I {{could go}} with you, Dick. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> {{when the work}} of searching for your father had begun, I could wait patiently for the result; but instead of that, I find myself even more anxious and more nervous than I was at Shadwell." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And so I was. And yet I {{felt that}} I {{ought not to}} have been sure. Sometimes, in my solitude, <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I myself had been wrong. I began to doubt whether under any {{circumstances}} I could have been justified in asking your father's daughter to be my wife." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{you love}} {{this time of}} the evening, Mr. Wooster, when the sun has gone to bed and all the bunnies come out to have their little suppers? When I was a child, <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> rabbits were gnomes, and that if I held my breath and stayed quite still, I should see the fairy queen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And is she bright at all, {{and simple}} still? She was the brightest, {{simplest}} lass in all Bull'ompton, <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think.</b> <b>I</b> suppose her old ways have a'most left her, Mr. Fenwick?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I married you {{in spite}} of it, and don't regret doing so. How cold you seem this afternoon! and yet <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{there never was a}} warmer heart than yours." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘I remember,’ resumed Mr. Gabriel Parsons, ‘when I was {{a younger}} man, with what a strange {{compound}} of feelings <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> drink that toast, and how <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> every woman was an angel.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Her {{acquaintance}} {{will begin}} earlier than mine. Do you remember showing me my first glow-worm at Beauchastel? <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the gem of my walks, before I knew better. It {{is a great}} treat to have poor Walter here in the holidays, so good and pleasant; but I must say one charm is the pleasure of being alone together afterwards.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} thought so too. I {{remember}} how <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it would last for ever, I felt I would rather die than be without you, and I used to long for {{the time when you}} would be faded and wrinkled so that nobody cared for you any more and I should have you all to myself." ...|$|E
60|$|LOUIS. I'll {{tell you}} a secret. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> our {{marriage}} was all an affectation, and that I'd break loose and run away some day. But now that I'm going to be broken loose whether I like it or not, I'm perfectly fond of you, and perfectly satisfied because I'm going to live as part of you and not as my troublesome self.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, not very. I {{wish there}} was a Y. M. C. A. here, so I could take up regular exercise. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> could do pretty good acrobatics, if I had a chance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> once," [...] said Hirst. [...] "But now they're all types. Don't take us,--take this hotel. You {{could draw}} circles round the {{whole lot of}} them, and they'd never stray outside." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "About {{the average}} height," [...] {{the captain said}} with some {{surprise}} in his tone; [...] "broader than Arabs generally are, but lithe and sinewy. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{there must be some}} Malay blood in him." ...|$|R
