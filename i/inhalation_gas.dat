25|$|Helium-3 nuclei have an {{intrinsic}} nuclear spin of , and {{a relatively high}} magnetogyric ratio. Helium-3 can be hyperpolarized using non-equilibrium means such as spin-exchange optical pumping. During this process, circularly polarized infrared laser light, tuned to the appropriate wavelength, is used to excite electrons in an alkali metal, such as caesium or rubidium inside a sealed glass vessel. The angular momentum is transferred from the alkali metal electrons to the noble gas nuclei through collisions. In essence, this process effectively aligns the nuclear spins with the magnetic field {{in order to enhance}} the NMR signal. The hyperpolarized gas may then be stored at pressures of 10 atm, for up to 100 hours. Following <b>inhalation,</b> <b>gas</b> mixtures containing the hyperpolarized helium-3 gas can be imaged with an MRI scanner to produce anatomical and functional images of lung ventilation. This technique is also able to produce images of the airway tree, locate unventilated defects, measure the alveolar oxygen partial pressure, and measure the ventilation/perfusion ratio. This technique may be critical for the diagnosis and treatment management of chronic respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, cystic fibrosis, and asthma.|$|E

30|$|All of the {{participants}} had longer endurance times to exhaustion under HO conditions than under NO conditions during high-intensity intermittent exercise (Fig.  1). Although {{there is evidence that}} exposure to hyperoxia improves performance during continuous exercise for more than 3  min [24, 27, 33], the effects of hyperoxic <b>gas</b> <b>inhalation</b> on performance during intermittent exercise have been controversial [30]. Exercise performance was improved by <b>inhalation</b> of hyperoxic <b>gas</b> during 6 -min recovery periods between five repetitions of high-intensity bench swimming [30], but not by <b>inhalation</b> of hyperoxic <b>gas</b> during 2 -min recovery periods between six 3 -min laboratory-based kayak ergometer sessions [22]. Our current results demonstrate that <b>inhalation</b> of hyperoxic <b>gas</b> during five entire 3 -min sessions of high-intensity intermittent exercise alternated with 3 -min rest periods improves exercise performance.|$|R
50|$|If the {{gas supply}} to the dosage {{mechanism}} were to fail without warning, the gas addition would stop and the diver would use up the oxygen in the loop gas until it became hypoxic and the diver lost consciousness. To prevent this, there is a controllable flow restriction in the inhalation side of the loop, which is operated by pressure from the supply gas in the dosage mechanism. This is open when there is suitable operating pressure in the dosage mechanism, but if this falls, the flow warning system imposes a restriction to the <b>inhalation</b> <b>gas</b> flow, similar {{to the effect of}} a low supply pressure on an open circuit demand valve, which warns the diver that there is a feed gas supply failure. The diver can then activate the reserve mechanism on the cylinder valve, which allows the last 25 bar from the cylinder to be used, which will de-activate the warning restriction. If the gas supply remains inadequate, the diver must take other action, such as bailing out to an independent open circuit gas supply.|$|E

40|$|In vivo {{monitoring}} of cells labeled with paramagnetic iron oxide particles by {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) is complicated by intrinsic contrast of blood vessels. Distinction between T 2 * effects caused by blood vessels from those caused by labeled cells was so far only possible after carefully following the location of hypointense regions through subsequent slices of T 2 *-weighted 3 -D MRI datasets, a procedure that is time consuming and not always reliable {{in the case of}} smaller blood vessels. Here, we demonstrate that the modification of the <b>inhalation</b> <b>gas</b> mixture from the routinely used composition 35 % O 2 and 65 % N 2 O to a mixture containing 95 % O 2 and 5 % CO 2 results in a contrast suppression of most small blood vessels and reduces the intrinsic T 2 * effect of large vessels dramatically in an animal model. This change in protocol of physiological conditions was well tolerated by all studied animals, even over prolonged experimental times. The changed <b>inhalation</b> <b>gas</b> mixture thus provides a more reliable identification method for small clusters of iron oxide labeled cells in vivo...|$|E
40|$|General anesthetics (GAs) have {{transformed}} surgery through their actions to depress {{the central nervous}} system and blunt the perception of surgical insults. Counterintuitively, many of these agents activate peripheral nociceptive neurons. However, the underlying mechanisms and significance of these effects have not been explored. Here, we show that clinical concentrations of noxious i. v. and <b>inhalation</b> <b>GAs</b> excite sensory neurons by selectively activating TRPA 1, a key ion channel in the pain pathway. Further, these GAs induce pain-related responses in mice that are abolished in TRPA 1 -null animals. Significantly, TRPA 1 -dependent neurogenic inflammation is greater in mice anesthetized with pungent compared with nonpungent anesthetics. Thus, our results show that TRPA 1 is essential for sensing noxious GAs. The pronociceptive effects of GAs combined with surgical tissue damage could lead to a paradoxical increase in postoperative pain and inflammation...|$|E
40|$|Label-free {{functional}} imaging {{of single}} {{red blood cells}} (RBCs) in vivo holds the key to uncovering the fundamental mechanism of oxygen metabolism in cells. To this end, we developed single-RBC photoacoustic flowoxigraphy (FOG), which can image oxygen delivery from single flowing RBCs in vivo with millisecond-scale temporal resolution and micrometer-scale spatial resolution. Using intrinsic optical absorption contrast from oxyhemoglobin (HbO_ 2) and deoxyhemoglobin (HbR), FOG allows label-free imaging. Multiple single-RBC functional parameters, including total hemoglobin concentration (C_(Hb)), oxygen saturation (sO_ 2), sO_ 2 gradient (∇SO_ 2), flow speed (v_f), and oxygen release rate (rO_ 2), have been quantified simultaneously in real time. Working in reflection instead of transmission mode, the system allows minimally invasive imaging at more anatomical sites. We showed the capability to measure relationships among sO_ 2, ∇SO_ 2, v_f, and rO_ 2 in a living mouse brain. We also demonstrated that single-RBC oxygen delivery was modulated by changing either the <b>inhalation</b> <b>gas</b> or blood glucose. Furthermore, we showed that the coupling between neural activity and oxygen delivery could be imaged at the single-RBC level in the brain. The single-RBC functional imaging capability of FOG enables numerous biomedical studies and clinical applications...|$|E

40|$|Goalto {{evaluate}} routine anesthesia {{strategy in}} ablation procedures by French electrophysiologists (EPs). MethodA questionnaire was e-mailed to 110 French EP. ResultsAnswers {{were obtained from}} 95 EP (86. 4 %) : 25 % working in a private center, 75 % in a public center. Anesthesiologists are always available in 70. 8 % of private centers vs 11. 4 % of public centers. When available, 54. 2 % are entirely dedicated to electrophysiology in private vs 18. 6 % in public centers. When an anesthesiologist is not available, sedation is obtained using midazolam associated with nalbuphin (32 %), morphine (16 %) or fentanyl (9 %). Propofol is used occasionally by 29 % of EPs (35 % in public, 9 % in private centers). Nitrous oxide <b>inhalation</b> <b>gas</b> is available in 40 % of private and 34. 3 % of public centers. Private EPs are satisfied with the anesthesiologist strategy in 100 % of cases versus only 41 % of public EP. A good or very good relationship with anesthesiologists is declared by 92 % of private EPs versus only 56 % of public EPs. ConclusionsCollaboration of anesthesiologists with EPs {{seems to be more}} operational in private centers.

40|$|Impaired {{nutrition}} of the {{intervertebral disc}} has been hypothesized {{to be one}} of the causes of disc degeneration. However, no causal relationship between decreased endplate perfusion and limited nutrient transport has been demonstrated to support this pathogenic mechanism. To determine the importance of endplate perfusion on solute diffusion into the nucleus pulposus and to show causality of endplate perfusion on intranuclear diffusion in large animal lumbar intervertebral discs, diffusive transport into ovine lumbar intervertebral discs was evaluated after inhibiting adjacent vertebral endplate perfusion. Partial perfusion blocks were created in vertebrae close and parallel to both endplates of lumbar discs of anaesthetized sheep. To assess diffusivity of small molecules through the endplate, N 2 O was introduced into the <b>inhalation</b> <b>gas</b> mixture and concentrations of intranuclear N 2 O were measured for 35 min thereafter. Post mortem, procion red was infused through the spinal vasculature and perfusion through the endplate was assessed by quantifying the density of dye-perfused endplate vascular buds in histology sections. Perfusion of the endplates overlying the nucleus pulposus was inhibited by almost 50 % in the partially blocked discs relative to the control discs. There was also a nine-fold decreased transport rate of intranuclear N 2 O in partially blocked discs compared with control discs. The density of perfused endplate vascular buds correlated significantly to the amount of transported intranuclear N 2 O (r 2 = 0. 52, P = 0. 008). The vertebral endplate was demonstrated to be the main route of intravascular solute transport into the nucleus pulposus of intervertebral discs, and inhibition of endplate perfusion can cause inhibited solute transport into the disc intranuclear tissue...|$|E
