5|$|The Battle of Salamis {{marked the}} {{turning point in the}} Greco-Persian wars. After Salamis, the Peloponnese, and by {{extension}} Greece as an entity, was safe from conquest; and the Persians suffered a major blow to their prestige and morale (as well as severe material losses). At the following battles of Plataea and Mycale, the threat of conquest was removed, and the Allies were able to go on the counter-offensive. The Greek victory allowed Macedon to revolt against Persian rule; and over the next 30 years, Thrace, the Aegean Islands and finally Ionia would be removed from Persian control by the Allies, or by the Athenian-dominated successor, the Delian League. Salamis started a decisive swing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> power toward the Greeks, which would culminate in an eventual Greek victory, severely reducing Persian power in the Aegean.|$|E
5|$|William met the {{invasion}} by dividing his forces into two groups. The first, which he led, faced Henry. The second, which included some who became William's firm supporters, such as Robert, Count of Eu, Walter Giffard, Roger of Mortemer, and William de Warenne, faced the other invading force. This second force defeated the invaders at the Battle of Mortemer. In addition to ending both invasions, the battle allowed the duke's ecclesiastical supporters to depose Mauger from the archbishopric of Rouen. Mortemer thus marked another {{turning point in}} William's growing control of the duchy, although his conflict with the French king and the Count of Anjou continued until 1060. Henry and Geoffrey led another invasion of Normandy in 1057 but were defeated by William at the Battle of Varaville. This was the last invasion of Normandy during William's lifetime. In 1058, William invaded the County of Dreux and took Tillières-sur-Avre and Thimert. Henry attempted to dislodge William, but the Siege of Thimert dragged on for two years until Henry's death. The deaths of Count Geoffrey and the king in 1060 cemented the shift <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> power towards William.|$|E
5|$|As the {{inception}} of the United Nations as an intergovernmental entity slowly began formalizing in 1944, delegates from 44 of its early member states met at a hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire for the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference, now commonly referred to as the Bretton Woods conference. Delegates remained cognizant {{of the effects of the}} Great Depression, struggles to sustain the international gold standard during the 1930s, and related market instabilities. Whereas previous discourse on the international monetary system focused on fixed versus floating exchange rates, Bretton Woods delegates favored pegged exchange rates for their flexibility. Under this system, nations would peg their exchange rates to the U.S. dollar, which would be convertible to gold at $35 USD per ounce. This arrangement is commonly referred to as the Bretton Woods system. Rather than maintaining fixed rates, nations would peg their currencies to the U.S. dollar and allow their exchange rates to fluctuate within a 1% band of the agreed-upon parity. To meet this requirement, central banks would intervene via sales or purchases of their currencies against the dollar. Members could adjust their pegs in response to long-run fundamental disequillibria <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> payments, but were responsible for correcting imbalances via fiscal and monetary policy tools before resorting to repegging strategies. The adjustable pegging enabled greater exchange rate stability for commercial and financial transactions which fostered unprecedented growth in international trade and foreign investment. This feature grew from delegates' experiences in the 1930s when excessively volatile exchange rates and the reactive protectionist exchange controls that followed proved destructive to trade and prolonged the deflationary effects of the Great Depression. Capital mobility faced de facto limits under the system as governments instituted restrictions on capital flows and aligned their monetary policy to support their pegs.|$|E

25|$|Early on, Leopold was {{assigned}} to hunt and kill bears, wolves, and mountain lions in New Mexico.

The official jobless rate fell from 15 percent in 1979 to 11 percent in 1980, but, {{partly because of the}} rapid growth of the labor force, unemployment rose again, to 13 percent in 1985. Inflation fell to about 25 percent in the 1981–82 period, but it climbed again, to more than 30 percent in 1983 and more than 40 percent in 1984. Although inflation eased somewhat in 1985 and 1986, it remained one of the primary problems facing economic policy makers.|$|E

25|$|A {{major shift}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> power {{is in the}} air; Eilan senses that {{the death of her}} peace-loving Arch-Druid {{grandfather}} will cause it. She tells her friend Caillean (who was rescued from her uncaring mother in Hibernia by Lhiannon) to take a group of young priestesses to the isle of Avalon to found a new sanctuary and become the first high-priestess of Avalon. In Vernemeton, Eilan is increasingly pressured by the new Arch-Druid, her father, to stop promoting peace and collaboration with the Romans. In a dramatic showdown she sacrifices herself (along with her love Gaius) to avoid a bloody insurgency and, in particular, {{to save the life of}} her son Gawen.|$|E
25|$|When a Mafia boss retires from {{leadership}} (or is killed), his clan's {{reputation as}} effective protectors and enforcers often goes with him. If his replacement has a weaker reputation, clients may lose {{confidence in the}} clan and defect to its neighbours, causing a shift <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> power and possible conflict. Ideally, the successor to the boss will have built a strong reputation of his own as {{he worked his way}} up the ranks, giving the clan a reputable new leader. In this way, established Mafia clans have a powerful edge over newcomers who start from scratch; joining a clan as a soldier offers an aspiring mafioso a chance to build up his own reputation under the guidance and protection of senior mafiosi.|$|E
25|$|Cutolo overplayed {{his hand}} in the Cirillo affair. His former {{political}} protectors turned and provided their support to his main rival Carmine Alfieri. When his main 'military' chief, Vincenzo Casillo was killed in January 1983 by the allies of Alfieri, it was clear Cutolo had lost the war. His power declined considerably. Not only Cutolo but many other Camorra gangs understood the shift <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> power caused by the death of Casillo. They abandoned the NCO and allied themselves with Alfieri. His sister who ran the business was arrested in 1993. He was moved to a prison on the island Asinara, far away from Naples and his ability to communicate with the outside was severely restricted when the harsh 41-bis prison regime was imposed upon him.|$|E

30|$|Facing {{imbalances}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> domestic {{economic environment}} and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> international <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> payments, {{a mix of}} opposing fiscal and monetary policy may help {{to strike a balance}} in both fields. This is because fiscal policy is more closely related to national economy while monetary policy is more related to the external economic environment. When the economy suffers from unemployment and sluggish growth domestically with a deficit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> international <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> payments, expansionary fiscal policy would help to stimulate general demand and create jobs. Although enlarged demand might drive up imports and increase <b>the</b> deficit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> international <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> payments, fiscal policy would affect the national economy more than the international economy. Logically, it would boost general demand (national income) first and then be reflected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> international <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> payments. <b>The</b> job opportunities created by new demand could more than offset the international deficit it brings. On the other hand, tight monetary policy that pushes up interest rates and welcomes capital inflow would help to rebalance <b>the</b> international <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> payments but suppress demand and worsen the unemployment situation. If one considers the short-term impact only, monetary policy would affect the international environment more than the domestic environment.|$|R

25|$|The {{break-up}} of Al-Andalus {{into the}} competing taifa kingdoms helped the long embattled Iberian Christian kingdoms gain the initiative. The {{capture of the}} strategically central city of Toledo in 1085 marked a significant shift <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> power in favour of the Christian kingdoms. Following a great Muslim resurgence in the 12th century, the great Moorish strongholds in the south fell to Christian Spain in the 13th century—Córdoba in 1236 and Seville in 1248. In the 13th and 14th centuries, the Marinid dynasty of Morocco invaded and established some enclaves on the southern coast but failed {{in their attempt to}} re-establish North African rule in Iberia and were soon driven out. After 800 years of Muslim presence in Spain, the last Nasrid sultanate of Granada, a tributary state would finally surrender in 1492 to the Catholic monarchs Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Ferdinand II of Aragon.|$|E
25|$|With the {{emergence}} of the Republicans as the nation's first major sectional party by the mid-1850s, politics became the stage on which sectional tensions were played out. Although much of the West– the focal point of sectional tensions– was unfit for cotton cultivation, Southern secessionists read the political fallout as a sign that their power in national politics was rapidly weakening. Before, the slave system had been buttressed to an extent by the Democratic Party, which was increasingly seen as representing a more pro-Southern position that unfairly permitted Southerners to prevail in the nation's territories and to dominate national policy before the Civil War. But Democrats suffered a significant reverse in the electoral realignment of the mid-1850s. 1860 was a critical election that marked a stark change in existing patterns of party loyalties among groups of voters; Abraham Lincoln's election was a watershed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> power of competing national and parochial interests and affiliations.|$|E
25|$|Although {{periphery}} {{nations are}} exploited by core countries, {{there is a}} purpose to the unequal exchanges of goods. For instance, the core countries {{have an incentive to}} gain a profit and this enables the world market to further grow. At times, there is a change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> trade between the periphery and core countries. This occurs when the prices of exports from periphery countries decrease at a faster rate than the exports from core nations. In this case, the governments of the periphery nation are affected in several ways. For instance, there is an increase in unemployment as well as a decrease in state income. This type of interaction is unique because the core country involved is somewhat weaker than normal. An example of this occurring is the growth of the industrial capabilities of Italy and Russia {{towards the end of the}} 19th century. This has also occurred in other periphery nations such as Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa.|$|E
