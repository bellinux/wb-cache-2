50|$|Dynamic {{simulation}} (or {{dynamic system}} simulation) {{is the use}} of a computer program to model the time varying behavior of a system. The systems are typically described by ordinary differential equations or partial differential equations. As mathematical models incorporate real-world constraints, like <b>gear</b> <b>backlash</b> and rebound from a hard stop, equations become nonlinear. This requires numerical methods to solve the equations. A numerical simulation is done by stepping through a time interval and calculating the integral of the derivatives by approximating the area under the derivative curves. Some methods use a fixed step through the interval, and others use an adaptive step that can shrink or grow automatically to maintain an acceptable error tolerance. Some methods can use different time steps {{in different parts of the}} simulation model. Industrial uses of dynamic simulation are many and range from nuclear power, steam turbines, 6 degree of freedom vehicle modeling, electric motors, econometric models, biological systems, robot arms, mass spring dampers, hydraulic systems, and drug dose migration through the human body to name a few. These models can often be run in real time to give a virtual response close to the actual system. This is useful in process control and mechatronic systems for tuning the automatic control systems before they are connected to the real system, or for human training before they control the real system.Simulation is also used in computer games and animation and can be accelerated by using a physics engine, the technology used in many powerful computer graphics software programs, like 3ds Max, Maya, Lightwave, and many others to simulate physical characteristics. In computer animation, things like hair, cloth, liquid, fire, and particles can be easily modeled, while the human animator animates simpler objects. Computer-based dynamic animation was first used at a very simple level in the 1989 Pixar short film Knick Knack to move the fake snow in the snowglobe and pebbles in a fish tank.|$|E

40|$|The Cassini {{spacecraft}} dynamics-related telemetry during long Main Engine (ME) burns {{has indicated}} {{the presence of}} stable limit cycles between 0. 03 - 0. 04 Hz frequencies. These stable limit cycles cause the spacecraft to possess non-zero oscillating rates for extended periods of time. This indicates that the linear ME guidance control system does not model the complete dynamics of the spacecraft. In this study, we propose that the observed limit cycles in the spacecraft dynamics telemetry appear from a stable interaction between the unmodeled nonlinear elements in the ME guidance control system. Many nonlinearities in the control system emerge from translating the linear engine gimbal actuator (EGA) motion into a spacecraft rotation. One such nonlinearity comes from the <b>gear</b> <b>backlash</b> in the EGA system, which {{is the focus of}} this paper. The limit cycle characteristics and behavior can be predicted by modeling this <b>gear</b> <b>backlash</b> nonlinear element via a describing function and studying the interaction of this describing function with the overall dynamics of the spacecraft. The linear ME guidance controller and <b>gear</b> <b>backlash</b> nonlinearity are modeled analytically. The frequency, magnitude, and nature of the limit cycle are obtained from the frequency response of the ME guidance controller and nonlinear element. In addition, the ME guidance controller along with the nonlinearity is simulated. The simulation response contains a limit cycle with similar characterstics as predicted analytically: 0. 03 - 0. 04 Hz frequency and stable, sustained oscillations. The analytical and simulated limit cycle responses are compared to the flight telemetry for long burns such as the Saturn Orbit Insertion and Main Engine Orbit Trim Maneuvers. The analytical and simulated limit cycle characteristics compare well with the actual observed limit cycles in the flight telemetry.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} two {{practically}} important {{issues associated with}} the development of an electromechanical brake (EMB, Brake-by-wire) and its safety control in early design stage. ^ The first issue is the development of an analytical dynamic model which should have all relevant degrees of freedom without being unnecessarily complex so as to be useful in PC simulation environment. This objective is achieved through the analytical model development of all relevant hardware components of EMB and modal analysis of its linearized approximation for model reduction. This model fulfills the need arising due to the nonexistence of an analytical model for EMB. The developed model has six degrees of freedom (DOF) and includes essential nonlinearities such as <b>gear</b> <b>backlashes,</b> Coulomb frictions, and disk air gap clearance. ^ The second issue is concerned with the safety control of EMB, either in case of force sensor failure or without using expensive force sensor for cost-saving purposes. To establish a force feedback structure without using force sensor, two simplified models are developed for contacting phase and non-contacting phase respectively, and a novel model based edge detection method is proposed and evaluated. Various parameter estimations are then performed to find realistic ways to obtain accurate and reliable estimates of key system parameters on-line to deal with the large operating ranges and changing working conditions of EMB. In addition, to deal with various nonlinearities and uncertain system parameters associated with an EMB, an advanced indirect adaptive robust controller (IARC) incorporated with the air gap management is designed for the entire brake operation to ensure a robust control performance. Extensive simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the analytical model and the achievable control performance of the imbedded IARC design without force sensor. Simulation results reveal that, in terms of transient tracking performance for ABS cycling, the proposed IARC clamping force controller without using force sensor shows much better results than the conventional PI controller with using force sensor. Thus, aside from the benefit of providing a fail-safe control strategy for force sensor failure, a much more stringent ABS cycle than currently used can be achieved with the proposed IARC to improve the friction force between the tire and the road for a shorter stopping distance. Such a much improved clamping force control performance is also vital for future advanced vehicle control using EMB. ...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objectives}} {{of this research}} are to develop a control- oriented dynamic model for <b>geared</b> servomechanisms with <b>backlash</b> and friction and to establish systematic methodologies of designing a feedforward plus feedback controller to achieve high precision. First, the dynamic model {{for the purpose of}} real- time control is developed for a spur <b>gear</b> system with <b>backlash</b> and friction. The complicated variation of the meshing stiffness as a function of contact point along the line of action is studied. Then the mean value of the meshing stiffness is used as the stiffness constant in the proposed model. Without sliding friction, two, simulations, free vibration and constant load operation, are performed to illustrate the effects of <b>backlash</b> on <b>gear</b> dynamics. Comparisons are also given of the simulation results with those of Yang and Sun's model. Then the average friction torque instead of the instantaneous friction torque is, proposed for the model to simplify the complexity of the system. Another two simulations are performed to illustrate the effects of backlash and friction on gear dynamics. In addition, the effect of adding a damper on the driving shaft, is also studied. Secondly, since the model for a <b>geared</b> servomechanism with <b>backlash</b> and friction is one example of nonsmooth dynamic systems, the traditional methods of examining existence and uniqueness properties and checking stability condition for such geared system are no longer valid. In this dissertation, Filippov's solution concept and his theorems are used to examine the existence and uniqueness properties for the proposed dynamic model. Furthermore, based on the extended stability theorems proposed by Shevitz and Paden, a general methodology is developed for the analysis of the stability, conditions of the equilibrium points for piece-wise continuous systems. The developed dynamic model is also examined using the above strategy. Finally, conventional control methods for a geared servomechanism usually do not take backlash and friction into account. As a result, accurate position control can not be achieved. In this dissertation, a new open-loop, optimization- based controller is developed to achieve accurate position tracking of a geared servomechanism. Path generation, selection of appropriate control input function, and optimization techniques for the design of such a controller are discussed. A systematic method of finding appropriate state, feedback gains to reduce the effects of possible load disturbance and model errors is also proposed. Numerical simulation results indicate that the improvement is quite satisfactory...|$|R
