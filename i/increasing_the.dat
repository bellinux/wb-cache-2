5|$|A {{contract}} {{to build the}} ship that would become Agincourt was signed on 3June 1911, and its keel was laid on 14September 1911. The design called for a staggering fourteen 12-inch guns, something historian David Topliss attributed to political necessity: the ship had to appear more powerful to the Brazilian populace than her predecessors (with twelve 12-inch guns) but, without <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> gun size, the only option left was <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> total number of guns.|$|E
5|$|Among the actinides, thorium and uranium are {{the easiest}} to isolate.
