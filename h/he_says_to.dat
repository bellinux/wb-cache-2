5|$|Eureka {{has been}} read in many ways, {{in part because}} Poe's sincerity in the work is questionable. It has been {{considered}} prophetically scientific, intuitively romantic, and even calculatingly ironic. Lacking scientific proof, Poe {{said it was not}} his goal to prove what <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> be true, but to convince through suggestion.|$|E

After an agonized hesitation at the crux of the decision, she surprises Homer at the plant and kisses him warmly. An ecstatic Homer abandons his work post to carry Marge away in his arms. His co-workers want to know what to tell the boss.

25|$|Distinguished {{in figure}} and manners, Abelard was seen {{surrounded}} by crowds – {{it is said}} thousands of students – drawn from all countries by the fame of his teaching. Enriched by the offerings of his pupils, and entertained with universal admiration, he came, as <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>to</b> think himself the only undefeated philosopher in the world. But a change in his fortunes was at hand. In his devotion to science, he had always lived a very regular life, enlivened only by philosophical debate: now, {{at the height of}} his fame, he encountered romance.|$|E

Gregory and Mary go off together, leaving Jason standing before the restaurant's mural of Dante and Beatrice, making clear his failure {{as an artist and}} lover. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> himself: [...] "I am alive, yet every hope I had is dead.

500|$|Meeting with Deep Throat again, Deep Throat {{explains}} that Wilczek is being detained {{by the government}} at an undisclosed location. When Mulder asks if the COS survived, Deep Throat assures him the virus left no trace of it, and that scientists from the Defense Department have unsuccessfully examined the machine for any remaining signs of the program. At the Eurisko Building, Peterson directs a team attempting to recover the COS, but is told by his superiors to destroy the machine in six hours. Unbeknownst to Peterson, the COS comes back to life and watches as <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> himself, [...] "I'm going to figure this thing out if it kills me".|$|E

[...] When a prisoner whom the Nazis believe to be a Jew claims to be German, Spiegelman has difficulty deciding whether to present this character as a cat or a mouse. [...] Throughout the book, Spiegelman incorporates and highlights banal details from his father's tales, sometimes humorous or ironic, giving a lightness and humanity to the story which [...] "helps carry the weight of the unbearable historical realities".|$|E
500|$|Two {{prints of}} Doppelgänger in its {{original}} 35mm format, for UK release, are known to exist. One is retained by the British Film Institute (BFI), the other by Fanderson, the official fan society dedicated to the Gerry Anderson productions. The original prints of Doppelgänger position Ian Hendry before Roy Thinnes in the opening credits; in the Journey to the Far Side of the Sun format, Thinnes is billed before Hendry. Certain UK prints alter the final scene featuring the old Jason Webb {{with the addition of}} a short voice-over from Thinnes in character as Ross, who is heard speaking a line that <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> Webb earlier in the film: [...] "Jason, we were right.

500|$|Hamlet {{is often}} {{perceived}} as a philosophical character, expounding ideas that are now described as relativist, existentialist, and sceptical. For example, he expresses a subjectivistic idea when <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> Rosencrantz: [...] "there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so". The idea that nothing is real except {{in the mind of}} the individual finds its roots in the Greek Sophists, who argued that since nothing can be perceived except through the senses—and since all individuals sense, and therefore perceive things differently—there is no absolute truth, but rather only relative truth. The clearest alleged instance of existentialism is in the [...] "to be, or not to be" [...] speech, where Hamlet is thought by some to use [...] "being" [...] to allude to life and action, and [...] "not being" [...] to death and inaction.|$|E
500|$|Manohar {{was part}} of a group {{involved}} in anti-government activities. Rangan drew similarities between his motives and those of characters in the Italian film The Night of the Shooting Stars (1982) and Unaru. Mouna Ragam introductory credits feature photographs of Revathi from her childhood through her teenage years which, according to rapper Blaaze, help viewers [...] "understand the girl, the character, her nature". According to Rangan, the scene where Divya is looking after Chandrakumar at the hospital reflects her traditional qualities; with her strengths, she is humane and vulnerable. Divya's mischievous nature is shown in a scene where she teaches a Sardar offensive Tamil phrases, which <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> V. K. Ramasamy's character. Revathi compared herself to Divya, saying that Divya believes in [...] "living life to the fullest" [...] and she was once like that. Sujatha Narayanan, writing for The New Indian Express, described Chandrakumar as a [...] "patient-understanding-and-poised-at-all-times" [...] man and Manohar as a [...] "dashing, brave and epitome-of-the-word-'dude. Narayanan noted that Divya, like the female leads in most of Ratnam's films, is [...] "practical with strong convictions" [...] and the characters [...] "go through their confusions unapologetically".|$|E

500|$|Hideaki Anno {{attempted}} to create characters that reflected {{parts of his}} own personality. The characters of Evangelion struggle with their interpersonal relationships, their personal problems, and traumatic events in their past. The human qualities of the characters have enabled some viewers of the show {{to identify with the}} characters on a personal level, while others interpret them as historical, religious, or philosophical symbols. Shinji Ikari is the series protagonist and the designated pilot of Evangelion Unit-01. After witnessing his mother Yui Ikari's death as a child, Shinji was abandoned by his father, Gendo Ikari. He is emotionally hyper-sensitive and sometimes does as expected out of fear of rejection, but he has often rebelled and refused to pilot the Eva because of the extremely excruciating harm that has been done to him or to his friends. Throughout the series <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> himself [...] "I mustn't run away" [...] as a means of encouraging himself to face the threats of the day, and this sometimes actually gives him bravery in battle, but he has a lingering habit of withdrawing in response to traumatic events. Anno has described Shinji as a boy who [...] "shrinks from human contact" [...] and has [...] "convinced himself that he is a completely unnecessary person".|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Jenna, {{worn out}} from working on TGS {{during the day}} and on her {{unlicensed}} Janis Joplin biopic at night, visits Dr. Leo Spaceman (Chris Parnell) for help so she can work on both. He gives Jenna a military-grade experimental drug currently being tested on rats to stay awake. At the same time, Tracy believes that having enough money to pay FCC fines means that he can say anything on television, and <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> Liz, [...] "I can even say what Ernest Borgnine whispered to me." [...] As a result, Tracy curses on The Martha Stewart Show, and after learning that the show's advertisers are pulling out, due to his actions, decides to sponsor the show. Meanwhile, Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming for General Electric, Jack Donaghy, desperately tries to find a name for a pocket microwave oven that is not offensive in any language. With Liz gone, Jack assigns the TGS writing staff, Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander), James [...] "Toofer" [...] Spurlock (Keith Powell), J. D. Lutz (John Lutz), Josh Girard (Lonny Ross), and Sue LaRoche-Van der Hout (Sue Galloway), to this task. After their unsuccessful attempts, Kenneth suggests [...] "The Funcooker" [...] which Jack decides is the perfect name.|$|E

Miles then radios Ben again, saying they have made it to Hydra Island and about his plan about the plane.

500|$|... "Russian Roulette" [...] {{begins with}} a [...] "searing" [...] guitar solo that later {{transitions}} into a [...] "pulsing" [...] beat which stays constant {{until the end of}} the song. The single opens with the lyrics, [...] "Take a breath/ Take it deep/ Calm yourself/ <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> me/ If you play/ You play for keeps/ Take the gun/ And count to three." [...] The metaphor about the game of Russian roulette is also present in the chorus in which Rihanna sings, [...] "And you can see my heart beating/ You can see it through my chest/ I said I'm terrified, but I'm not leaving/ I know that I must pass this test/ So just pull the trigger." [...] In the upcoming verse, the character that the singer portrays in the song it's scared that the man talking to her will always have a power over, [...] "Say a prayer to yourself/ He says close your eyes/ Sometimes it helps/ And then I get a scary thought/ That he's here means he's never lost." [...] "Russian Roulette" [...] ends with a sound of a gun shot, which according to Michaelangelo Matos of The A.V. Club extends the drama accompanied by [...] "harrowing scenarios and tremulous vocals".|$|E
500|$|The {{story is}} about {{a little boy who}} leaves his home with his dog to shop for food items for his mother, and {{attempts}} to remember the list of things she wanted him to buy. [...] The original request from his mother is [...] "six farm eggs, a cake for tea, a pound of pears, and don't forget the bacon." [...] Along with the dog, he is accompanied on his trip by a butterfly. In order to avoid forgetting items, the boy recites his mother's list to himself. Throughout his trip to the store, the boy sees items along the way that play tricks with his memory, and items on his list one-by-one become substituted with other goods. [...] "Six farm eggs" [...] initially becomes [...] "Six fat legs" [...] then [...] "Six clothes pegs", and [...] "A cake for tea" [...] initially becomes [...] "A cape for me" [...] then [...] "A rake for leaves", and [...] "A pound of pears" [...] initially becomes [...] "A flight of stairs" [...] then [...] "A pile of chairs". By the end of his trip, the boy has forgotten the initial items requested, and supplants them in his mind with [...] "Six clothes pegs, a rake for leaves, a pile of chairs, and don't forget the bacon". Then he goes to the junk shop and says to a merchant there, [...] "Six clothes pegs, a rake for leaves, and a pile of chairs please!". The merchant in the junk shop assists the boy in compiling to this odd list. While travelling back to his home, he remembers the original items and corrects his mistakes. Then on the way home, <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> himself, [...] "Six farm eggs, a cake for tea, and a pound of pears". However, he still forgets to acquire bacon when he gets home. And finally, he says, [...] "I FORGOT THE BACON!". Finally, the final panel depicts the child carrying a basket and a coin purse, taking his dog attached to a leash, and do an en route; probably to purchase the bacon which he forgot.|$|E
