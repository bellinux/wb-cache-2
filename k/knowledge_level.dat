2500|$|The EMDs next {{priority}} is to provide and assist the layperson/caller with pre-arrival instructions to help the victim, using standardized protocols developed in co-operation with local medical directors. Such instructions may consist of simple advice to keep the patient calm and comfortable or to gather additional background information for responding paramedics. [...] The instructions can also frequently become more complex, providing directions over the telephone for an untrained person to perform CPR, for example. [...] Examples of EMDs guiding family members through assisting a loved one {{with the process of}} childbirth prior to the arrival of the ambulance are also quite common. [...] The challenge for the EMD is often the <b>knowledge</b> <b>level</b> of the caller. [...] In some cases, the caller may have prior first-aid and/or CPR training, but it is often just as likely that the caller has no prior training or experience at all. [...] This process may still consist of a symptom-based flip-card system, but is increasing automated into the CAD software.|$|E

The participants were consisted of 1184 students from 11 secondary schools in Mugla and asked to fill out a questionnaire form, which was consisted of 50 questions. The form contained two scales, one of socio-demographical property of the individuals and the other scale was about <b>knowledge</b> <b>levels</b> of students. The findings present a clear data of the well known dilemma of knowing the right thing and doing wrong about risks of those that should beware of AIDS.

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, however, it became obvious, {{that a more}} {{professional}} approach is needed. The sending of physicians to the scene was introduced, following the concept [...] "bringing the doctor to the patient, not the patient to the doctor". The development of the system [...] "emergency physician" [...] (Notarzt) started, bearing the need for somewhat qualified assistance on scene. A law to establish the occupation of Rettungssanitäter has been discussed, with a 3-year training curriculum. The government however saw difficulties in financing the training of this new profession. So, eventually in 1977 the original idea was introduced as a 3.5 month (520 hours) training curriculum common to all Länder (federal states) of Germany. This led to a more professionalized approach, but clearly {{below the level of}} the intended original law. By the 1980s it became clear that many situations were occurring in which the <b>knowledge</b> <b>level</b> of the Rettungssanitäter was inadequate, especially in cases where a Notarzt wasn't available in time. The developing of pre-clinical procedures demanded additional qualification for treating patients in the field. It was deemed necessary to find a new profession with even more knowledge and skills.|$|E
2500|$|... 2005 – Med Jones of the International Institute of Management {{introduced}} the first GNH Index and Global GNH Index Survey. The GNH Index, {{also known as}} Gross National Well-being (GNW) Index framework served as the first integrated objective (economic) and subjective (happiness) socioeconomic development framework. Prior the GNH Index, there were few development indices that improved upon {{the gross domestic product}} (GDP), but did not measure happiness. For example, the Genuine Progress Indicator was focused on the environmental cost of economic development, then later (in 2006) it was updated to include similar measures to the GNH Index. Another development index is the Human Development Index (HDI) that originally focused on literacy and education but also did not measure happiness. The HDI now measures three basic dimensions of human development, health (as measured by life expectancy at birth), overall <b>knowledge</b> <b>level</b> (as measured by the literacy rate), and standard of living (as measured by GDP per capita for a given year). Among the criticisms of the HDI is the complaint that it [...] is a mixture of stock measures (life expectancy at birth and literacy rate) and a flow measure (GDP per capita for a given year). [...] To overcome this criticism, Hou, Walsh, and Zhang (2015) proposed a new index called HDIF (Human Development Index Flow), in which they replaced life expectancy at birth by the under-five mortality rate (for a given year), and they also replaced the literacy rate by the gross primary school enrollment ratio for a given year). [...] They calculated both the HDI and the HDIF for many countries and found that [...] "the HDIF and the HDI tend to converge for wealthy countries and diverge for poor countries, especially those with low HDI rankings". The development performance of poor countries improved using the HDIF while the performance of the wealthy countries declined.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundHealthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) are an {{important}} public health problem. It is estimated that approximately 1 out of every 20 hospitalized patients will contract an HCAI. The risk is substantial not only to patients but also to healthcare workers, who may contract deadly blood-borne infectious diseases. Hence, {{it is essential for}} healthcare professionals to have adequate knowledge regarding infection prevention practices (IPPs) to reduce the burden of these illnesses among patients seeking care. MethodsThis cross-sectional study was conducted among 268 medical students at Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore. Information regarding important IPPs such as hand hygiene (HH), needle-stick injuries (NSIs), and standard precautions (SPs) was collected using a semi-structured questionnaire. The collected information was analyzed using SPSS v. 11. Fisher's exact test was used to test the association between variables of interest. ResultsOverall, <b>knowledge</b> <b>levels</b> regarding HH were low in aspects such as healthcare workers’ hands as sources of infection (40 %) and the minimum time needed to apply hand rubs (45. 7 %), whereas <b>knowledge</b> <b>levels</b> were high in aspects such as indications for using HH. Regarding NSI prevention, <b>knowledge</b> <b>levels</b> were low in aspects such as activities with the highest NSI risk (56 %). However, <b>knowledge</b> <b>levels</b> were high in relation to SPs. ConclusionThe <b>knowledge</b> <b>levels</b> regarding infection practices were not adequate among the participants, particularly in the case of hand hygiene methods. Other important aspects, such as needle-stick injuries and use of standard precautions, were better understood, although many aspects still require improvement. These findings suggest the need to consider strengthening the training related to IPPs as a separate entity in the existing curriculum...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Sexuality in {{the elderly}} still remains a taboo, {{especially}} in the institutional context. Demographic changes have been occurring these past few years which led {{to an increase in}} the number of institutionalized elders, as an attempt to respond their needs. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to know the <b>levels</b> of <b>knowledge</b> and attitudes of the professional caregivers, how these are related and how these relate with the socio demographic variables. METHODS: Quantitative, exploratory, comparative and correlational study. Convenience sample of professional caregivers (n= 329), which accepted to participate by answering to the Aging Sexual Knowledge and Attitudes Scale (ASKAS), which allowed the knowledge and attitudes measure about sexuality {{in the elderly}}. RESULTS: There is a positive correlation between the <b>knowledge</b> <b>levels</b> and the attitudes and, generally, the caregivers present good <b>knowledge</b> <b>levels</b> and the attitudes about sexuality in the elderly are permissive. However, there is a difference between the qualified technicians and the auxiliary staff, as the former present better <b>knowledge</b> <b>levels</b> and more permissive attitudes. Generally, the individuals with higher educational qualifications also present higher <b>knowledge</b> <b>levels</b> and more permissive attitudes. None of subjects referred attending any kind of training or education in this area. Single individuals present better <b>knowledge</b> <b>levels</b> and more permissive attitudes than the married ones. The older individuals present less permissive attitudes as well as the more experienced caregivers. CONCLUSION: The knowledge is related with the attitudes about sexuality in the elderly. This topic remains a delicate subject for many of the individuals, especially for who work in an institutional context. Education and training of these caregivers and a continuous research play a key role in the quality of life of the elders and the quality of the provided services...|$|R

Multi-session tasks were used in the study, which enables the convenience of eliciting users’ topic knowledge during their process of completing the whole tasks. The study was a 3 -session laboratory experiment with 24 participants, each time working on one subtask in an assigned 3 -session general task. The general task was either parallel or dependently structured. Questionnaires were administered before and after each session to elicit users’ perceptions of their <b>knowledge</b> <b>levels,</b> task attributes, and other task features, for both the overall task and the sub-tasks. Our results support the assumption that users’ knowledge generally increases after each search session, but there were exceptions in which a “ceiling” effect was shown. We also found that knowledge was correlated with users’ perceptions of task attributes and accomplishment. In addition, task type was found to affect several aspects of <b>knowledge</b> <b>levels</b> and <b>knowledge</b> change.
