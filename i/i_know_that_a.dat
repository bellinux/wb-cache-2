2500|$|The Genesis port of Flicky was {{reviewed}} by multiple western publications, {{most of which}} found the game to have poor graphics and sound but highly addictive and enjoyable gameplay. Reviewers noted poor initial impressions based on appearance and sound. They found the sprites to be simple, the colors garish, and the music repetitive. However, when they began to play the game, {{they found that the}} simple appearance complemented the simple yet engaging gameplay. Computer and Video Games described Flicky as a guilty pleasure and discussed its cute appearance in positive light. Reviewers from Electronic Gaming Monthly also pointed out the games cuteness and concluded that the game was aimed for children and provided lower scores. Critics from both Computer and Video Games and Mean Machines wrote that employees in their offices were disappearing into their game room to play Flicky.
