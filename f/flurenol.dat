40|$|Recently, {{numerous}} {{studies have been conducted}} to evaluate the development of soybean crop productivity and the formation of root nodules with respect to the management of nitrogen fertilizers. Objective of this research was to evaluate the effects of <b>flurenol</b> foliar application on the productivity and root nodules formation of soybean (Glycine max L. Merrill) plants and the total protein patterns in seed and root nodules. Soybean (Glycine max L. Merrill) plants cv. Crawford were cultivated in newly reclaimed sandy soil during two growing seasons and treated by foliar application of <b>flurenol</b> at 50, 100 and 200 mg L - 1 at 40 Days after Sowing (DAS). Furthermore, electrophoretic analysis of the seeds and root nodules was conducted to investigate the total protein bands and their similarity using sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) method. Most <b>flurenol</b> treatments resulted in significantly decreased plant height and increased the number of branches. Furthermore, the number of root nodules and the dry weight of the plants significantly increased in response to treatment with 100 mg L - 1 <b>flurenol,</b> with up to 47. 67 and 35. 67 root nodules and root nodule dry weights of 0. 2287 and 0. 1777 g being observed in 2006 and 2007, respectively. Evaluation of the root nodule protein patterns revealed a dissimilarity of 33. 33 % between all <b>flurenol</b> treatments and untreated plants. Based on these results, <b>flurenol</b> treatment at 100 mg L - 1 with inoculating seeds with Bradyrhizobium japonica is recommended to enable the reduction of N fertilizers and increase the yield productivity of soybean cv. Crawford in Egypt...|$|E
40|$|Basipetal {{transport}} of [14 C]IAA in hypocotyl segments isolated from various regions of etiolated Helianthus annuus L. cv NK 265 seedlings declines with increasing physiological age. This decline {{was the result}} of a reduction in both transport capacity and apparent velocity. Net IAA uptake was greater and the abilities of auxin transport inhibitors to stimulate net IAA uptake were reduced in older tissues. Net IAA accumulation by microsomal vesicles exhibited a similar behavior with respect to age. Specific binding of [3 H]N- 1 -naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) to microsomes prepared from young and older hypocotyl regions was saturable and consistent with a single class of binding sites. The apparent affinity constants for NPA binding in microsomes prepared from young versus older tissues were 6. 4 and 10. 8 nanomolar, respectively, and the binding site densities for young versus old tissues were 7. 44 and 3. 29 picomoles/milligram protein, respectively. Specific binding of [3 H]NPA in microsomes prepared from both tissues displayed similar sensitivities toward unlabeled <b>flurenol</b> and exhibited only slight differences in sensitivity toward 2, 3, 5 -triiodobenzoic acid. These results demonstrate that the progressive loss of basipetal IAA transport capacity in etiolated Helianthus hypocotyls with advancing age is associated with substantial alterations in the phytotropin-sensitive, IAA efflux system and they suggest that these changes are, at least partially, responsible for the observed reduction of polar IAA transport with advancing tissue age...|$|E
