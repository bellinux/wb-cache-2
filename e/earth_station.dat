5|$|The {{basis for}} TrollSat was an {{agreement}} signed in 2006 between the Norwegian Polar Institute, the Norwegian Space Centre and Kongsberg Satellite Services. It specified that the Space Centre would install a Kongsberg-built radome, while the Polar Institute would provide power and undertake maintenance. In exchange, they could freely use the <b>earth</b> <b>station</b> {{for their own}} transmission needs. The commercial activities would {{be carried out by}} Kongsberg Satellite Services. A concern was raised regarding if satellite downloading would violate the Antarctic Treaty, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs negated. The station started operations on 1 March 2007 and was officially opened by Prime Minister of Norway, Jens Stoltenberg.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{contract with}} ESRO lasted until 1 July 1974, when their low-Earth orbit program terminated. NTNF proposed closing Tromsø Telemetry Station as the remaining customers {{did not provide}} sufficient revenue to keep operations viable. Norway also declined to join the European Space Agency (ESA), which resulted in little hope in ESA choosing to cooperate with a Norwegian <b>earth</b> <b>station.</b> NTNF also looked into outright selling the station to ESA, but the offer was turned down. Kongsfjord Telemetry Station was closed in 1974.|$|E
25|$|Iridium routes {{phone calls}} through space. In {{addition}} to {{communicating with the}} satellite phones in its footprint, each satellite in the constellation also maintains contact with two to four adjacent satellites, and routes data between them, to effectively create a large mesh network. There are several earth stations which link to the network through the satellites visible to them. The space-based backhaul routes outgoing phone call packets through space {{to one of the}} <b>earth</b> <b>station</b> downlinks ("feeder links"). Station-to-station calls from one satellite phone to another can be routed directly through space without going through an <b>earth</b> <b>station.</b> As satellites leave the area of an <b>earth</b> <b>station,</b> the routing tables are updated and packets headed for the <b>earth</b> <b>station</b> are forwarded to the next satellite just coming into view of the <b>earth</b> <b>station.</b> Communication between satellites and earth stations is at 20 and 30GHz.|$|E

25|$|For special purposes, other active {{elements}} {{have been}} used. For example, {{in the early}} days of the satellite communication, parametric amplifiers were used. The core circuit was a diode whose capacitance was changed by an RF signal created locally.

The second failure, detected on 16 May, was attributed to excessive radiation from the Sun.|$|E

25|$|The eighty gigabits {{per second}} of {{bandwidth}} each Ka band satellites offers is an improvement on the four to six {{gigabits per second}} capacity available from earlier interim satellites. The satellites bounce signals from a satellite dish on the premises to an <b>earth</b> <b>station,</b> known as a 'gateway'; the gateway is then connected to a POI via a fibre backhaul. The satellite design was 'not easy', because the required coverage is about 'five per cent of the world's land mass' containing 'at least 200,000 premises' spread across 'over 7,000 kilometres' of area between Cocos Islands and Norfolk Island.|$|E
25|$|In March 2012, {{following}} Delhi and Mumbai, RMC Chennai started installing 10 50-feet automatic {{rain gauge}} (ARG) stations to provide location-specific weather data. Equipped to measure humidity, rainfall and temperature, {{they will help}} make accurate forecasts, specifying the rainfall variability. Hourly data from the ARG stations are transmitted to a geostationary satellite, which re-transmits the data, which help to validate the measurements from the Doppler radar, to the receiving <b>earth</b> <b>station</b> at Pune. The ARGs are run on solar power. The first one was installed in Sholinganallur followed by Taramani, Anna University, Hindustan University, LMOIS Kolapakkam, Poonamallee, Chembarambakkam, Puzhal, Kattupakkam and Avadi.|$|E

25|$|The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) {{provided}} {{assistance of}} $500,000 {{for setting up}} the Experimental Satellite Communications <b>Earth</b> <b>Station</b> (ESCES) at Ahmedabad and nominated the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) as the executing agency for this project. The UNDP provided another $1.5million, for setting up a TV studio at Ahmedabad and a TV transmitter at Pij in Kheda district. It also gave assistance for setting up a TV Training Institute to train many of the programme production staff who would join All India Radio to work on SITE. UNESCO was the executing agency for this project. UNICEF contributed to SITE by sponsoring 21 film modules produced by Shyam Benegal, a noted Indian filmmaker. This resulted {{in a lot of}} interaction between filmmakers and folk-artists. Shyam Benegal went on to include many of these artists in his children's feature film Charandas Chor (1975).|$|E
25|$|The {{television}} programmes {{prepared by}} the Indian government at the four studios were transmitted at 6GHz to ATS 6 from one of two ground stations located in Delhi and Ahmedabad. These signals were then re-transmitted at 860MHz by the satellite, which were directly received in 2000 villages by community television receivers with 3m parabolic antennas. Regular television stations also received the signals and broadcast them to another 3000 villages in the standard VHF television band. Each television signal had two audio channels to carry audio in two major languages of each cluster. This setup was called the Direct Reception System (DRS). Apart from the direct broadcasts, the <b>earth</b> <b>station</b> at Ahmedabad was micro-wave linked to the TV transmitter built {{in the village of}} Pij. The Delhi studio was linked to the terrestrial TV transmitters of AIR. A receive-only station was built in Amritsar and linked to the local TV transmitter.|$|E
