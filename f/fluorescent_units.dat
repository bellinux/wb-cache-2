There was a significant (P less than 0. 01) correlation between the immunofluorescence recorded with the fluorometer and that evaluated visually with a microscope. The swine exposed orally to swine dysentery infective inoculum and subsequently hyperimmunized by the intravenous inoculation of live cultures of T. hyodysenteriae had the highest average <b>fluorescent</b> signal <b>unit,</b> which was 104. 5.

Flow cytometric analysis of cells fluorescently-tagged with the lectins Bandeiraea simplicifolia (BS- 1) and Concanavalin A (ConA) indicated that CLENDOs of midcycle CL do not {{differ from those of}} pregnancy.

40|$|A {{new class}} of Dendrimeric Systems (Dendrimers and Dendrons) {{and the study of}} their {{properties}} in molecular recognition processes are presented. These Dendrimers (BAPAD: BisAminoalkylPolyAmideDendrimers), are designed to present peripheral amino groups and based on a skeletal amide bonds. They will be prepared by iterative condensation of di(beta-amino) acids prepared by reduction of the corresponding azido or nitro compounds. Dendron-like systems will be prepared following the same methodology. The versatility of these dendrimeric structures can be exploited by the dinitroderivative approach, according to the synthetic strategies that can be applied in the dendrimer construction.

40|$|An {{enzyme-linked}} immunoassay (EIA) {{combined with}} a solution hybridization (SH) reaction was devised to detect human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) provirus amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In this nonisotopic PCR assay, designated PCR-EIASH, a fragment of the HIV- 1 gag gene from {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs) was first amplified with biotinylated primers. The biotinylated amplified DNA segment was reacted in solution with an internal RNA probe labeled with digoxigenin- 11 -UTP. Hybrids were captured in a microtiter plate coated with streptavidin. Specific bound hybrids were quantitated by the addition of an enzyme-labeled antibody against digoxigenin and a fluorogenic substrate. The hybridization, immunological, and amplification parameters of PCR-EIASH were optimized as follows: 12. 5 pmol of each primer was used in the PCR; the reannealing reaction of amplified products with the RNA probe, which was used at 0. 30 microgram/ml, was completed in 30 min at 70 degrees C in 2 x SSC (1 x SSC is 0. 15 M NaCl plus 0. 015 M sodium citrate). Five copies of HIV- 1 DNA diluted in a lysate of 100, 000 PBMCs from a seronegative control could be detected by PCR-EIASH with a signal of 41 +/- 3 <b>fluorescent</b> <b>units</b> above a background noise of 13 +/- 2 <b>fluorescent</b> <b>units.</b> A total of 91 PBMC lysates from 91 seropositive patients sampled once and 20 PBMC lysates from 10 seropositive patients sampled twice were tested in duplicate in the PCR-EIASH; 107 samples were positive in duplicate tests, 1 sample was indeterminate, and 3 samples were negative.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{photosynthetic}} unit (PSU) is reviewed {{in the light}} of the authors' results in the fields of fluorescence and luminescence (delayed light). Models of PSU are mainly distinguished by the amount of exciton exchange which is allowed between units. The “separate” model, with its “first-order” character, is not consistent with fluorescence kinetic data. The sigmoidal rise of fluorescence under actinic light is best explained by “nonseparate” models; however, most of these models assume a delocalization of excitons or centers. The “connected” model introduced here is not subject to this criticism. It discloses a new effect (the “îlot” effect) : a nonrandom grouping of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>units</b> the consequences of which are discussed. It is noted that a “two-quantum” model for the photochemical reaction gives results very similar to those of the connected model.

Neutralizing antibody levels to RV- 3 and AT/ 76 increased rapidly postchallenge.

Control nonvaccinated piglets that were fed AT/ 76 developed severe dehydrating diarrhea and low levels of neutralizing antibody to AT/ 76 alone. The apparent heterologous clinical protection observed in this study could have been predicted from results of in vitro assays. Neutralization tests with reduction of fluorescence focus indicated a one-way cross-reaction between RV- 3 and AT/ 76 such that hyperimmune antiserum to RV- 3 neutralized porcine virus to moderate titer, but not vice versa.

40|$|Several methods {{exist to}} {{retrieve}} and purify DNA fragments after agarose or {{polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis}} for subsequent analyses. However, molecules present in low concentration and molecules similar in size to their neighbors are difficult to purify. Capillary electrophoresis has become popular in molecular diagnostic laboratories because of its automation, excellent resolution, and high sensitivity. In the current study, the ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer was reconfigured into a fraction collector by adapting the standard gel block to accommodate a collection tube at the distal end of capillary. The time to collect the desired peaks was estimated by extrapolating from standard capillary electrophoresis using the original gel block. Fraction collection from a mixture of DNA fragments amplified from wild type and several internal tandem duplication mutations of the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt 3) gene yielded highly purified DNA fragments containing internal tandem duplication mutations and predictable electrokinetics using the reconstructed gel block.

40|$|The {{self-organization}} of {{the proper}} subunits of a fluorescence chemosensor {{on the surface of}} silica nanoparticles allows the easy design and realization of new effective sensing systems. Commercially available silica particles (20 nm diameter) were functionalized with triethoxysilane derivatives of selective Cu(II) ligands and fluorescent dyes. Grafting of the sensor components to the particle surface ensures the spatial proximity between the sensor components and, as a consequence, binding of Cu(II) ions by the ligand subunits leads to quenching of the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>units</b> emission. In 9 : 1 DMSO-water solution, the coated silica nanoparticles (CSNs) selectively detect copper ions down to nanomolar concentrations. The operative range of the sensors can be tuned either by switching the ligand units or by modification of the components ratio. Sensors with the desired photophysical properties can be easily prepared by using different fluorescent dyes. Moreover, the organization of the network of sensor components gives rise to cooperative and collective effects: on one hand, the ligand subunits bound to the particle surfaces cooperate to form multivalent binding sites with an increased affinity for the Cu(II) ions; on the other hand, binding of a single metal ion leads to the quenching of several fluorescent groups producing a remarkable signal amplification...|$|E

Purified porcine surfactant served as a further control. Lamellar bodies and lung ultrasound score were also measured in {{a subset of the}} neonates treated with CPAP. Surfactant was administered according to the European guidelines, and clinical data were collected prospectively. Surfactant activity was measured as adsorption at the air/liquid interface and given in relative <b>fluorescent</b> <b>units</b> (RFU). Results: Surfactant activity differed among native porcine surfactant (median, 4863 RFU; IQR, 4405 - 5081 RFU), healthy term neonates (median, 2680 RFU; IQR, 2069 - 3050 RFU), and preterm neonates with RDS (median, 442 RFU; IQR, 92 - 920 RFU; P <. 0001).

40|$|Recently, we have {{developed}} a series of fast photochromic imidazole dimers with a [2. 2]paracyclophane ([2. 2]PC) moiety that bridge diphenylimidazole units and succeeded the acceleration of the thermal decoloration rate. The colorless [2. 2]PC-bridged imidazole dimers show a photoinduced homolytic bond cleavage of the C-N bond between the imidazole rings to give a pair of colored imidazolyl radicals upon UV light irradiation, followed by the radical-radical coupling reaction to form the initial C-N bond between the imidazole rings. The decoloration reaction to give the initial imidazole dimer proceeds only thermally. The high quantum yield close to unity of the photochromic reaction and the large extinction coefficient of the radical achieve both high optical density at the photostationary state and rapid switching speed. The application to rapid fluorescence switching has been investigated {{to develop a new}} type of photochromic fluorescence switching molecule applicable to super-resolution microscopy. The widespread absorption of the colored radical lying between 500 and 900 nm enables the efficient quenching of the excited electronic state of the fluorophores by Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the fluorophores to the radical moiety. We successfully developed a [2. 2]PC-bridged imidazole dimer possessing a fluorescein moiety as a fluorescence unit.

Fluorescents are mass marketed. CFL fluorescents are the cheapest option, but more than a couple bulbs are almost always required to be running at once. The next step up is shop lights, available mostly in 2-ft (609 mm) or 4-ft (1219 mm) fluorescent tubes. The best type of fluorescent are called High Output Fluorescents. Also available in 2-ft (609 mm) and 4-ft(1219 mm) tubes, these bulbs provide more wattage (54 watts each is standard) thus more lumens per watt (92 at the current time).

Especially, fabricating fluorescent materials for the detection of Zinc cation has drawn much more attention [9 – 13], as Zinc not only plays important roles in human bodies [14, 15], but also closely relates to severe pathological diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases [16]. So far, much study has been done for the detection and real-time localization of Zn(II). Yasuhiro Shiraishi’s group has synthesized a quinoline–polyamine conjugate as a fluorescent chemosensor for quantitative detection of Zn(II) in water [17]. Maarten Merkx et al. used chelating fluorescent protein chimeras for ratiometric detection of Zn(II) in living cells and the detection range was from 10 nM to 1 mM [18]. Jinshi Ma and coworkers have synthesized several bis(pyrrol- 2 -yl-methyleneamine) ligands as fluorescent sensor for Zn(II) [11], and their results revealed that the ligands exhibit excellent fluorescent properties. However, much of the work was just based on organic molecules as fluorescent chemosensors. For a few practical applications the attachment of the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>units</b> to a solid support has advantages like the possibility of recovering the materials for their repetitive use. For this point, scientists chose silica nanoparticles [12], nanosized boehmite particles [13] and silicon nanowires [19] to support fluoresence ligands as fluorescence sensors. And these materials exhibit excellent selectivity and sensitivity to sense metal ions.|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesSupervised {{exercise}} training (SET) {{is recommended}} for patients with intermittent claudication (IC). The optimal exercise programme has not been identified, and the potential adverse effects of exercise on these patients warrant consideration. Calpain proteases have been linked with tissue atrophy following ischaemia–reperfusion injury. High calpain activity may therefore cause muscle wasting in claudicants undergoing SET, and skeletal muscle mass (SMM) is integral to healthy ageing. This study assesses the impact of (1) treadmill-based SET alone; and (2) treadmill-based SET combined with resistance training on pain-free walking distance (PFWD), SMM, and calpain activity. MethodsThirty-five patients with IC were randomised to 12 weeks of treadmill only SET (group A), or combined treadmill and lower-limb resistance SET (group B). PFWD via a 6 -minute walking test, SMM via dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, and calpain activity via biopsies of gastrocnemius muscles were analysed. ResultsIntention-to-treat analyses revealed PFWD improved within group A (160  m to 204  m, p = . 03), but not group B (181  m to 188  m, p = . 82). There was no between group difference (p = . 42).

40|$|The genetic {{profiles}} of evidentiary samples found at crime scenes are generated {{in order to}} determine the likelihood that a person contributed to DNA to the sample. One of the most challenging aspects of forensic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analysis is that samples collected from crime scenes often contain only trace amounts of DNA; these samples are often referred to as low template DNA (LTDNA). Due to the low initial concentration of genetic material in LTDNA samples, substantive environmental insults will likely result in compromised DNA profiles that exhibit lower allele peak heights than expected, or in some cases, complete allele drop-out. The research detailed in this study investigates the impact various sources of compromise have on relative <b>fluorescent</b> <b>unit</b> (RFU) signal obtained from LTDNA samples. The potential for stochastic allele loss during a silica extraction of DNA prior to downstream processing is first considered using a dynamic systems model simulating the probability for allelic loss at each step in the procedure. Next, the impacts of damaging or degrading the DNA on the electropherogram signal are explored. Trends in RFU signal of LTDNA samples subjected to sonication by a sonic dismembrator probe, ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, and enzymatic digestion by two different enzymes are assessed, with the aim of creating a reference for typical behaviors in RFU signal data in compromised LTDNA. The distributions of electropherogram profile data from compromised LTDNA are then compared against one another {{in order to determine}} if the compromising methods explored in the study act on the samples in similar ways. The RFU signal data from the compromised LTDNA are then evaluated alongside the provided degradation index (DI) value resulting from quantification using the Quantifiler® Trio quantification kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Oyster Point, CA). The DI value acts as an early assessment of the quality of DNA samples and can be used to optimize downstream processing. Its ability to accurately predict behavior in compromised LTDNA samples is assessed through comparison of the DI value to the decrease in RFU signal as the samples are subjected to higher levels of simulated environmental insults...|$|R
40|$|A male infant with {{a severe}} {{neutrophil}} motility disorder and poorly polymerizable actin in PMN extracts was reported {{over a decade ago}} to have neutrophil actin dysfunction (NAD) (1974. N. Engl. J. Med. 291 : 1093 - 1099). Polymerized actin (F-actin) content of fixed and permeabilized intact neutrophils from the father, mother, and sister of the NAD index case have been measured using nitrobenzoxadiazole-phallacidin, a fluorescent compound which binds specifically to actin filaments. F-actin content of unstimulated PMN from all three family members was significantly lower than unstimulated control PMN (mean 23. 6 +/- 0. 4 SEM <b>fluorescent</b> <b>units</b> vs. 32. 6 +/- 0. 6 for controls). After stimulation with the chemotactic peptide FMLP, maximal F-actin content of NAD family member PMN was below that of controls (52. 7 +/- 1. 3 vs. 72. 6 +/- 1. 8). F-actin content of detergent insoluble cytoskeletons after stimulation with FMLP was also significantly lower in PMN from NAD family members as compared with controls (21 +/- 6 % vs. 73 +/- 8 %). PMN extracts from the father and mother, when treated with 0. 6 M KCl, polymerized half as much actin as controls. Whereas diisopropylfluorophosphate treatment of normal PMN decreased actin polymerizability in cell extracts, this treatment increased the assembly of actin in parental PMN extract. Addition of purified actin to NAD extracts failed to reveal an abnormal actin polymerization inhibitory activity, and no obvious structural defect in actin purified from the father's PMNs was noted by HPLC and two dimensional thin layer chromatography of tryptic digests. The present studies of actin assembly in intact PMNs confirm that NAD is associated with a true defect in PMN actin assembly and is a genetic disorder that is recessively inherited...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveThe {{receptor}} {{for advanced}} glycation end products (RAGE) is expressed {{at high levels}} in the lung, particularly in type 1 alveolar cells, and {{has been shown to}} amplify injury triggered by acute stress. Previous studies suggest serum concentrations of soluble RAGE increase during pulmonary reperfusion injury after transplantation. RAGE blockade has been shown to suppress hepatic and cardiac ischemia and reperfusion injury in mice. Thus we tested the hypothesis that RAGE mediates tissue-injury mechanisms in ischemia and reperfusion injury in the lung. MethodsC 57 BL/ 6 mice were subjected to 30 minutes of pulmonary ischemia by clamping the left hilum, followed by 60 minutes of reperfusion. Lung function was assessed by means of blood gas analysis, and capillary leak was assessed by injecting fluorescein isothiocyanate–labeled albumin and comparing fluorescence in bronchial lavage fluid with that in serum. Histologic analysis of the lung was performed by a pathologist naive to the experimental conditions. ResultsIn animals subjected to RAGE blockade, significant increases in Po 2 (108 vs 73 mm Hg, P =. 0094) and more than 3 -fold decrease in capillary leak Relative <b>Fluorescent</b> <b>Units</b> (RFU, 6. 12 vs 1. 75; P =. 001) were observed. Histologic examination revealed significant injury reduction in soluble RAGE-treated animals versus control animals. RAGE knockout mice exhibited a protected phenotype when exposed to pulmonary ischemia and reperfusion. Additionally, interleukin 8 production and nuclear factor κB activation were increased in control mice. ConclusionAbrogation of RAGE signaling attenuates pulmonary ischemia and reperfusion injury. This study suggests that RAGE might {{play a central role in}} pulmonary reperfusion injury and in transplantation and that blockade of RAGE might offer a potential target to abrogate pulmonary reperfusion injury in clinical transplantation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDigital PCR in {{droplets}} (ddPCR) is {{an emerging}} method {{for more and}} more applications in DNA (and RNA) analysis. Special requirements when establishing ddPCR for analysis of genetically modified organisms (GMO) in a laboratory include the choice between validated official qPCR methods and the optimization of these assays for a ddPCR format. Differentiation between droplets with positive reaction and negative droplets, that is setting of an appropriate threshold, can be crucial for a correct measurement. This holds true in particular when independent transgene and plant-specific reference gene copy numbers have to be combined to determine the content of GM material in a sample. Droplets which show <b>fluorescent</b> <b>units</b> ranging between those of explicit positive and negative droplets are called ‘rain’. Signals of such droplets can hinder analysis and the correct setting of a threshold. In this manuscript, a computer-based algorithm has been carefully designed to evaluate assay performance and facilitate objective criteria for assay optimization. Optimized assays in return minimize the impact of rain on ddPCR analysis. We developed an Excel based ‘experience matrix’ that reflects the assay parameters of GMO ddPCR tests performed in our laboratory. Parameters considered include singleplex/duplex ddPCR, assay volume, thermal cycler, probe manufacturer, oligonucleotide concentration, annealing/elongation temperature, and a droplet separation evaluation. We additionally propose an objective droplet separation value which is based on both absolute fluorescence signal distance of positive and negative droplet populations and the variation within these droplet populations. The proposed performance classification in the experience matrix can be used for a rating of different assays for the same GMO target, thus enabling employment of the best suited assay parameters. Main optimization parameters include annealing/extension temperature and oligonucleotide concentrations. The droplet separation value allows for easy and reproducible assay performance evaluation. The combination of separation value with the experience matrix simplifies the choice of adequate assay parameters for a given GMO event...|$|E
40|$|A rapid, simple fluorometric {{method is}} {{described}} for measuring antibody to Pasteurella haemolytica in sera of cattle. Various antigen preparations were compared {{for the test}} including live, formalin-killed and phenol-killed P. haemolytica. A preparation composed of formalin-killed organisms from a 22 hour culture gave consistent results and {{was used in the}} studies. The test was reproduciable with percent coefficients of variation for <b>fluorescent</b> signal <b>unit</b> values on ten or more replicate samples ranging from 5. 7 to 28. 0. Sera from calves vaccinated by aerosol exposure to live P. haemolytica had up to a five-fold increase in antibody titer as measured by the flurometric method test during a 21 day period. Fluorometric method titers were comparable to those obtained by the indirect bacterial agglutination test. There was no seroconversion to P. haemolytica in calves vaccinated by aerosol exposure of P. multocida. The major advantages of the fluorometric method test over conventional methods are that the assay does not require serial dilutions of serum samples and thus limits time and effort to determine antibody titers...|$|R
40|$|A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain {{reaction}} (RT-PCR) and microplate-reverse hybridization method {{were developed to}} detect and type dengue viruses in patients plasma specimens. A silica method was used to isolate RNA; and 32 ̆ 7 -noncoding region universal primers were used to amplify dengue virus RNA. Using RT-PCR and ethidium bromide staining we could detect dengue virus in serum spiked with serially diluted dengue virus {{with a level of}} sensitivity similar to that of a quantitative fluorescent focus assay of dengue viruses in cell culture, i. e. 1. 4 <b>fluorescent</b> focus <b>units</b> per reaction. Applying this assay to 14 dengue-positive plasma samples and 13 dengue-negative samples, dengue viremia was detectable by RT-PCR with a sensitivity comparable to mosquito inoculation. To determine the serotypes, digoxigenin-labeled PCR products from plasma samples and six laboratory adapted dengue viruses were hybridized in stringent conditions to serotype-specific DNA probes immobilized on microplates, and the hybridized product was detected with a colorimetric assay. Serotypes of dengue viruses, in cell culture and in patient plasma specimens, were identified using this method...|$|R
40|$|Phenylcarbamate {{derivatives}} of amylose and β-cyclodextrin show excellent chiral recognition {{when used}} as chiral stationary phases (CSPs) for high-performance liquid chromatography. To open up new possibilities of carbohydrate-based materials, we developed chiral fluorescent sensors based on amylose and β-cyclodextrin (Am- 1 b and CyD- 1 b, respectively) by attaching <b>fluorescent</b> π-conjugated <b>units</b> {{on their side}} chains. Their recognition abilities toward chiral analytes containing a nitrophenyl unit were evaluated by measuring the enantioselective fluorescence quenching behavior. Both sensors showed {{the same degree of}} enantioselective fluorescence response for various aromatic nitro compounds. However, in some cases, their enantioselectivities were different depending on the analytes. The difference in the chiral recognition abilities between Am- 1 b and CyD- 1 b seems {{to be based on the}} structural difference of their inherent backbones, that is, the one-handed helical structure and cyclic structure, respectively. The study on the resolution ability of the Am- 1 b-based CSP revealed that the terthienyl-based pendant of Am- 1 b provides not only a fluorescent functionality but also a different chiral recognition site from that of amylose tris(phenylcarbamate) ...|$|R
