40|$|Density, {{viscosity}} and {{refractive index}} of some binary mixtures of <b>dibutyl</b> <b>maleate</b> with acetophenone, cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone, and 3 -pentanone have been measured {{over the entire}} composition range at (303. 15, 308. 15 and 313. 15) K and at atmospheric pressure. Excess volume (V E) and deviation in viscosity () have been estimated from the experimental data of density and viscosity. The results of excess properties are interpreted in terms of molecular interactions. These results were fitted to Redlich-Kister polynomial equation to estimate the binary coefficients and standard errors. Further the values of (V E) have been analyzed using Prigogine-FloryPatterson (PFP) theory. Refractive index composition data {{are discussed in the}} light of various equations suggested by Lorentz-Lorentz, Weiner and Newton. The mixture viscosities have also been correlated using Auslaender and Krishnan-Laddha models...|$|E
40|$|Statistical {{copolymerization}} {{has been}} performed for five binary systems using 1 -methoxy- 2 -methyl- 1 -trimethylsilyloxy propene (initiator) and tetrabutylammonium bibenzoate (catalyst) in tetrahydrofuran solution. The copolymer compositions {{were determined by}} elemental analysis for nitrogen and the results evaluated by the Kelen-Tudos method. The monomer pairs concerned are (1) acrylonitrile (AN) and methyl methacrylate (MMA), (2) AN and ethyl methacrylate (EMA), (3) AN and butyl methacrylate (BMA), (4) AN and butyl acrylate (BA), (5) AN and <b>dibutyl</b> <b>maleate</b> (DBM). The reactivity ratios determined in this study are: (1) gamma(AN) = 10. 22, gamma(MMA) = 0. 07; (2) gamma(AN) = 5. 68, gamma(EMA) = 0. 16; (3) gamma(AN) = 8. 59, gamma(BMA) = 0. 09 : (4) gamma(AN) = 4. 08, gamma(BA) = 0. 06; (5) gamma(AN) = 1. 38, gamma(DBM) = 0. 06.

40|$|The {{chemical}} reactions occurring during the melt blending between a <b>dibutyl</b> <b>maleate</b> functionalized polyolefin (POF) and poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) {{in the presence}} of Zn(OOCCH 3) 2 $ 2 H 2 O were studied as a function of blending conditions, such as the preliminary drying of PET, the presence of a nitrogen flow during blending and the time of blending. The selective extraction of POF/PET 30 / 70 by weight blends to remove unreacted PET and the determination of its molecular weight by viscosimetric measurements allowed to evaluate both the grafting points’ number and the molecular weight of PET. In this way the impact of degradation of PET onto its grafting by transesterification onto POF was investigated. The examined blending conditions were shown to affect both PET degradation and POFePET copolymer formation. In order to correlate data about macromolecular and morphological structure with the final properties of the blends, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and tensile tests were also carried out...|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{knowledge}} of PVC degradation and stabilisation, chemical modifications were imposed on degraded PVC and raw PVC {{with the aim of}} obtaining non-migrating additives. The modifications were carried out mainly in the presence of <b>dibutyl</b> <b>maleate</b> (DBM), and the resulting polymer contained dibutyl maleic residues. Such modifications result in a polymer which contain substantive additives which resist migration under aggressive environments. Previous studies have shown that stable nitroxyl radicals function as stabilisers in polymer during processing (e. g. PP, PVC) by deactivating a large number of kinetic chains via a redox process whereby the concentrations of the nitroxyl and its reduced form, the hydroxylamine, fluctuate reciprocally and rhythmically. In order to understand the major reactions involved in such systems, a simulation method was used which resulted in a mathematical model and some rate constants, explaining the kinetic behaviour exhibited by such system. In the process of forming a suitable model, two nonlinear oscillators were proposed, which could be of interest in the study of nonlinear phenomenon because of their chaotic behaviour...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThree new {{vinyl ether}} {{monomers}} containing phosphonate moieties were synthesized from transetherification reaction. We {{showed that the}} yield was dependent on the spacer length between the vinyl oxy group and the phosphonate moieties: when the spacer is a single methylene side reaction may occur, leading {{to the formation of}} acetal compounds. Free-radical copolymerizations of phosphonate-containing vinyl ether monomers with maleic anhydride were carried out, leading to alternated copolymers of rather low molecular weights (from 1000 to 7000 g/mol). Both gel permeation chromatography and 31 P NMR analyses enhanced possible intramolecular transfer reactions occurring from the phosphonate moieties. Kinetic investigation showed that the electron-withdrawing character of the phosphonate moieties tends to decrease the rate of copolymerization. Nevertheless, almost complete monomers conversion was reached after 30 min of reaction with dimethyl vinyloxyethylphosphonate (VEC 2 PMe). Then, radical copolymerization of VEC 2 PMe with a series of electron- accepting monomers, that is, <b>dibutyl</b> <b>maleate,</b> dibutylitaconate, itaconic anhydride, butyl maleimide, and methyl maleimide, led to a series of alternated copolymers. From kinetic investigation, we showed that the higher the electron-accepting effect, the faster the vinyl ether consumption and the higher the molecular weights...|$|E
40|$|The {{relation}} between ignition delay and flame lift-off length (based on OH* chemiluminescence) {{has been studied}} in an optically accessible heavy-duty diesel engine. Soot production has been studied as well, using both exhaust soot data and high-speed imaging of the in-cylinder natural luminosity. Since the luminosity is estimated to scale with T^ 13 for our experimental conditions, the local temperature becomes a decisive factor {{in the interpretation of}} naturalluminosity images. The fuels used include regular diesel and blends of various oxygenates (cyclohexanone, anisole, and <b>dibutyl</b> <b>maleate)</b> with synthetic diesel, to cover a wide range of cetane numbers and oxygen content. Based on a literature review, we hypothesize that the flame speed only determines an upper limit for the flame lift-off length (rather than its exact position). Under conditions that promote auto-ignition, the lift-off length may be shorter, and is likely governed by ignition chemistry. For the oxygenated fuels, the flame lift-off length is found to increase with ignition delay. An inverse correlation is found between the soot luminosityand the oxygen ratio at the lift-off length. The anisole-blend does not produce measurable amounts of exhaust soot as long as the injection duration is shorter than the ignition delay. Under cooled EGR-like conditions, the ignition delay is so large that anisole is considered a candidate fuel for soot-free operation of heavy-duty diesel engines up to medium load...|$|E
40|$|The biggest {{challenge}} {{in front of}} energy scientists {{is to find the}} alternative to diesel engine fuel due to depletion of fossil fuels and the environmental pollution, which is increasing alarmingly. Oxygenated fuel is one of the viable solutions to the global environmental changes. Dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and <b>Dibutyl</b> <b>Maleate</b> (DBM) are two hopeful fuel additives to reduce emission in diesel engine, due to their high oxygen content, 53. 3 and 28 % respectively. This paper presents an experimental study of their effects on the emission characteristics of a diesel engine. DMC and DBM was used with diesel in different blends for all load ranges of the engine viz. at no load, 25 %, 50 % and 75 % of full load and at full load. All tests were conducted at steady state and were set at constant engine speed 1500 RPM. The smoke content reduces by 35 % at full load conditions using DMC 20 blend, the oxygen content in the emission increases by 39 % with DBM 15, the decrease in the % of unburnt hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide is respectively 19 and 21. The blends of diesel with 15 % DMC and DBM by volume is the best fraction for reduction of smoke and CO emissions without much affecting the performance of the engine. On the basis of the results obtained, these additives are effective method for reducin...|$|E
40|$|Combustion {{behavior}} of various oxygenated fuels {{has been studied}} in a DAF heavy-duty (HD) directinjection (DI) diesel engine. From these fuels, it is well-known that they lead to lower particle (PM) emissions; however, for a given fuel oxygen mass fraction, there are significant differences in PM reduction. Although this {{can be traced back}} to the specific molecular structure of the oxygenate in question, no consensus can be found in the literature as to the explanation hereof. In this study, the sooting tendency (smoke number) of three oxygenates [viz., tripropylene glycol methyl ether (TP), <b>dibutyl</b> <b>maleate</b> (DB), and cyclohexanone (X 1) ] was compared to that of commercial diesel fuel (EN 590, D). The results suggest that the cetane number (CN) (i. e., fuel reactivity) may play an important role. More specifically, the low reactive oxygenate X 1, with its cyclic carbon chain, was found to perform exceptionally well compared to the more reactive linear and branched oxygenates DB and TP, respectively. Cyclic oxygenates are abundant in nature. Cellulose, the most common organic compound on earth, is the best-known example. Although it is not trivial, liquid cyclic oxygenates can be made from lignocellulosic biomass. Particularly, the production of C 6 oxygenates (e. g., guaiacol, cyclohexanone, phenol, etc.), which can be derived from lignin, is the subject of current investigation. Fuels produced from such biomass (e. g., plant waste or the nonedible part of plants) are referred to as secondgeneration biofuels and are expected to play a pivotal role in the near future...|$|E
