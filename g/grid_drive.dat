40|$|This paper {{presents}} the electrical design and first operational {{results of a}} 5 Megawatt feedback controlled amplifier system designed to drive a 300 uH saddle coil set on the ``HBT-EP`` tokamak. It {{will be used to}} develop various plasma feedback techniques to control and inhibit the onset of plasma disruptions that are observed in high ``B`` plasmas. To provide a well characterized system, a high fidelity, high power closed loop amplifier system has been refurbished from the Los Alamos ``ZT-P`` equilibrium feedback system. In it`s configuration developed for the Columbia HBT-EP tokamak, any desired waveform may be generated within a I 100 ampere and 16 kV peak to peak dynamic range. An energy storage capacitor bank presently limits the effective full power pulse width to 10 mS. The full power bandwidth driving the saddle coil set is {approximately} 12 kHz, with bandwidth at reduced powers exceeding 30 kHz. The system is designed similar to a grounded cathode, push-pull, transformer coupled, tube type amplifier system. `Me push pull amplifier consists of 6 each Machlett ML 8618 magnetically beamed triodes, 3 on each end of the (center tapped) coupling transformer. The transformer has. I volt-seconds of core and a 1 : 1 turns ratio. The transformer is specially designed for high power, low leakage inductance, and high bandwidth. Each array of ML 8618 `s is (grid) driven with a fiber optic controlled hotdeck with a 3 CXI 0, 000 A 7 (triode) output. To linearize the ML 8618 <b>grid</b> <b>drive,</b> a minor feedback loop in the hotdeck is utilized. Overall system response is controlled by active feedback of the saddle coil current, derived from a coaxial current viewing resistor. The detailed electrical design of the power amplifier, transformer, and feedback system will be provided in addition to recent HBT-EP operational results...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the initial electrical and mechanical design of two phase-locked 30 Megawatt RMS, 150 kHz oscillator systems used for current drive and plasma sustainment of the ''Translation, Confinement, and Sustainment'' (TCS) field reversed configuration (FRC) plasma. By {{the application of}} orthogonally-placed saddle coils {{on the surface of}} the glass vacuum vessel, the phase-controlled rotating magnetic field perturbation will induce an electric field in the plasma which should counter the intrinsic ohmic decay of the plasma, and maintain the FRC. Each system utilizes a bank of 6 parallel magnetically beamed ML 8618 triodes. These devices are rated at 250 Amperes cathode current and a 45 kV plate voltage. An advantage of the magnetically beamed triode is their extreme efficiency, requiring only 2. 5 kW of filament and a few amps and a few kV of <b>grid</b> <b>drive.</b> Each 3. 5 uH saddle coil is configured with an adjustable tank circuit (for tuning). Assuming no losses and a nominal 18 kV plate voltage, the tubes can circulate about 30 kV and 9 kA (pk to pk) in the saddle coil antenna, a circulating power of over 33 megawatts RMS. On each cycle the tubes can kick in up to 1500 Amperes, providing a robust phase control. DC high-voltage from the tubes is isolated from the saddle coil antennas and tank circuits by a 1 : 1 coaxial air-core balun transformer. To control the ML 8618 's phase and amplitude, fast 150 Ampere ''totem-pole'' grid drivers, an ''on'' hot-deck and an ''off'' hot-deck are utilized. The hot-decks use up to 6 each 3 CPX 1500 A 7 slotted radial beam triodes. By adjusting the conduction angle, amplitude may be regulated, with inter-pulse timing, phase angle can be controlled. A central feedback timing chassis monitors each systems' saddle coil antenna and appropriately derives each systems timing signals. Fiber-optic cables are used to isolate between the control room timing chassis and the remote power oscillator system. Complete system design detail will be presented in addition to anticipated (computer generated) performance characteristics. Initial design and construction began in FY 97, and will continue through FY 98, with delivery to the experiment in FY 99, for commencement of physics experiments on sustaining the FRC...|$|E

Their stability and entrainment process are important in global climate studies, as well as for local weather forecasting. The purposes of the experimental simulations are to study this process and to address this paradox. The effects of buoyancy reversal is investigated, followed by two types of experiments. An instability experiment involves the behavior of a fully turbulent wake near the inversion generated by a sliding plate. Due to buoyancy reversal, the heavy, mixed fluid starts to sink, turning the potential energy created by the mixing process into kinetic energy, thereby increasing the entrainment rate.
