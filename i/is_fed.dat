The female incubates for 17–18days before the altricial downy chicks are hatched, and <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> at the nest by the male. The female broods the newly hatched chicks for around ten days, and then both parents share feeding and nest sanitation duties. The chicks fledge 31–41days after hatching.|$|E

Such larvae have soft bodies with no limbs, and have a blind gut (presumably so that they do not foul their cell).|$|E

5|$|Amino acids {{are either}} used to {{synthesize}} proteins and other biomolecules, or oxidized to urea {{and carbon dioxide}} {{as a source of}} energy. The oxidation pathway starts with the removal of the amino group by a transaminase. The amino group <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> into the urea cycle, leaving a deaminated carbon skeleton {{in the form of a}} keto acid. Several of these keto acids are intermediates in the citric acid cycle, for example the deamination of glutamate forms α-ketoglutarate. The glucogenic amino acids can also be converted into glucose, through gluconeogenesis (discussed below).|$|E
5|$|Galveston Bay {{is mostly}} shallow {{with an average}} depth of 7–9feet. It <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> by the Trinity River and the San Jacinto River, {{numerous}} local bayous and incoming tides from the Gulf of Mexico. This unique and complex mixing of waters from different sources supports many types of marine life including crabs, shrimp, oysters, and many varieties of fish thereby supporting a substantial fishing industry. Additionally the system of bayous, rivers, and marshes that ring the Bay support their own ecosystems allowing for diverse wildlife and enabling freshwater farming of crawfish. The areas near the bay shore in fact have a higher diversity of habitats than the nearby Gulf coast.|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} with 141 multiparous pregnant sows {{was conducted to}} investigate whether the supply of glucogenic energy {{at the end of}} pregnancy may be insufficient for an optimal growth of the foetuses in sows that <b>are</b> <b>fed</b> a diet {{with a high level of}} non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) and low level of starch. Sows <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> one of three diets from day 85 of pregnancy until parturition: : :Sows <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> a high NSP low starch diet. The daily intake of starch and sugar was 500 g. : :Sows <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> the same diet in the same amount as the sows in treatment 1 plus an extra daily amount of 500 g starch from wheat starch (is glucogenic energy). This means that the sows <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> 0. 58 kg/d extra wheat starch (is 6. 73 MJ glucogenic NE) during the last month of pregnancy. : :Sows <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> the same diet in the same amount as the sows in treatment 1 plus an extra daily amount of 200 g soya oil (is 6. 73 MJ lipogenic NE). This treatment was added because otherwise it will not be clear whether energy or glucogenic energy is thelimiting factor. : :From day 1 of day 85 of pregnancy all sows <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> the high NSP low starch diet. During lactation all sows <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> the same lactation diet. Effects on litter performance, on changes in body weight and backfat thickness of the sows, and on feed intakeduring lactation were studied. The supply of extra dietary starch or extra dietary fat in late-pregnant sows that <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> a high NSP low starch diet did not increase litter weight at birth. This suggests that sows that <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> the high NSP low starch diet received sufficient glucogenic energy for foetal development. : :The number of stillborn piglets was numerically higher in sows that received extra dietary fat at the end of pregnancy. Sows that <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> extra dietary starch or extra dietary fat increased more in weight and backfat thickness during late pregnancy than sows that <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> the high NSP low starch diet. Decreases in weight and backfat thickness during lactation were similar for the three experimental treatments. Voluntary feed intake during lactation was slightly decreased in sows that <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> extra starch or extra fat in late pregnancy. :The present study shows that late-pregnant sows can <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> a high NSP low starch diet without adverse effects on litter weight at birth. A daily intake of 500 to 600 g starch and sugar in latepregnant sows seems sufficient for optimal growth of the foetuses...|$|R

40|$|CONSOL {{completed}} {{characterization of}} 64 samples from five run conditions of HTI Run ALC- 1 (227 - 94), in which raw and cleaned (oil-agglomerated at low pH) Black Thunder Mine subbituminous coal <b>was</b> <b>fed</b> and processed using only dispersed catalysts in the liquefaction reactors. Extraction of THF-soluble resid from the pressure-filter cakes was more complete when agglomerates <b>were</b> <b>fed,</b> leaving only 5 % or less THF solubles in the extracted cakes. When raw coal <b>was</b> <b>fed,</b> the extracted cakes contained 9 - 34 % THF solubles. HTI also observed improved filtration during the periods that agglomerates <b>were</b> <b>fed.</b> Improved operability, if verified by additional work, {{could be an}} economically significant benefit of coal cleaning by oil agglomeration at low pH. An apparently higher Mo addition rate (see fourth bullet) {{may have contributed to}} the benefits of using oil-agglomerated coal. Other stream sample characteristics changed when oil-agglomerated coal <b>was</b> <b>fed</b> in Conditions 2 - 4, relative to when uncleaned coal <b>was</b> <b>fed</b> in Conditions 1 and 5. The ash content of the 0 - 6 bottoms samples was lower when oil-agglomerates <b>were</b> <b>fed.</b> The THF-soluble 524 {degrees}C+ resid concentration in the feed slurry doubled when agglomerated coal <b>was</b> <b>fed.</b> Three factors may have influenced these characteristics. Higher coal conversion would have produced more resid. More efficient toluene-extraction of the filter cake would have recycled more resid. Removal of distillate as product to offset oil fed as part of the agglomerated coal would preferentially recycle the heaviest components...|$|R
5|$|In modern times, a {{wide variety}} of causes have contributed to the condor's decline. Its low clutch size (one young per nest), {{combined}} with a late age of sexual maturity, make the bird vulnerable to artificial population decline. Significant past damage to the condor population has also been attributed to poaching, especially for museum specimens, lead poisoning (from eating animals containing lead shot), DDT poisoning, electric power lines, egg collecting, and habitat destruction. During the California Gold Rush, some condors were even kept as pets. The leading cause of mortality in nestling condors is the ingestion of trash that <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> to them by their parents.|$|E

The river then turns south in southern Idaho and eventually flows into the northeast arm of the Great Salt Lake. The Weber River also starts on the north slope of the Uinta Mountains and flows into the east edge of the lake.
