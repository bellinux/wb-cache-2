500|$|Similar to {{the long}} jump, the triple jump takes place on a track heading towards a sandpit. Originally, athletes would <b>hop</b> <b>on</b> the same leg twice before jumping into the pit, but this was changed to the current [...] "hop, step and jump" [...] pattern from 1900 onwards. There is some dispute over whether the triple jump was contested in ancient Greece: while some historians claim that a contest of three jumps {{occurred}} at Ancient Games, others such as Stephen G. Miller believe this is incorrect, suggesting that the belief stems from a mythologised account of Phayllus of Croton having jumped 55 ancient feet (around 16.3m). The Book of Leinster, a 12th-century Irish manuscript, records the existence of geal-ruith (triple jump) contests at the Tailteann Games.|$|E

500|$|In 1977 Le Mesurier portrayed Jacob Marley in a BBC {{television}} {{adaptation of}} A Christmas Carol, which starred Michael Hordern as Ebenezer Scrooge; Sergio Angelini, {{writing for the}} British Film Institute about Le Mesurier's portrayal, considered that [...] "although never frightening, he does exert {{a strong sense of}} melancholy, his every move and inflection seemingly tinged with regret and remorse". In 1979 he portrayed Sir Gawain in Walt Disney's Unidentified Flying Oddball, directed by Russ Mayberry, and co-starring Dennis Dugan, Jim Dale and Kenneth More. The film, an adaptation of Mark Twain's novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, was hailed by Time Out as [...] "an intelligent film with a cohesive plot and an amusing script" [...] and cited it as [...] "one of the better Disney attempts to <b>hop</b> <b>on</b> the sci-fi bandwagon".

Raised in the borough's East New York-section, Maxwell's previous musical experience included his beginnings {{as a singer}} in the congregation of his Baptist church, which had {{become an integral part}} of his life after the death of his father in a plane crash. Already a fan of what he described as [...] "jheri curl soul", which was the trademark of early 1980s R acts such as Patrice Rushen, S.O.S. Band and Rose Royce, Maxwell began to teach himself to play a variety of instruments.

Once the style was more defined, they picked from tracks they had worked on which fell in line with others, similar to making a mix tape. The group intends to release these recordings that were closely related to Wildflower [...] "within a year or so" [...] of the album's release. This will help them [...] "clean the slate" [...] for new music to be made.|$|E
