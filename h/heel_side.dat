25|$|The {{object of}} the jump was to revitalize his feud with Negro Casas. El Hijo del Santo lost a match to Casas at the CMLL 63rd Anniversary show on September 20, 1996 and took a brief hiatus. While gone, Negro Casas turned técnico (face) and his former allies, Scorpio, Jr. and Bestia Salvaje said they had a {{surprise}} for Casas. The set-up was a trios match with Negro Casas, El Dandy and Héctor Garza on the técnico side with Scorpio, Jr. and Bestia Salvaje on the rudo (or <b>heel)</b> <b>side.</b> El Hijo del Santo {{came down to the}} ring with Scorpio and Salvaje but was wearing a disguise and pretending to be El Felino, the brother of Negro Casas. During the match, Scorpio and Salvaje began attacking Casas and the fans, unaware of the ruse, expected El Felino to save his brother from the beating. Once he entered the ring, El Hijo del Santo removed the disguise and revealed himself as Scorpio and Salvaje's partner, thus turning rudo {{for the first time in}} his career.|$|E
50|$|The {{illustration}} called 'Stopping and Hitting' {{shows that}} when a vertical stick shaft is aligned to {{the centre of the}} ball part of the ball protrudes to the <b>heel</b> <b>side,</b> this would happen even if the heel was not a bend but a 90° corner {{and the only way to}} cover the entire ball with the shaft held vertical is to use a set-back head—that is a head that is set-back to the <b>heel</b> <b>side</b> of the shaft.|$|E

5000|$|During Embry's {{times as}} a heel, fans(especially in Puerto Rico) would often chant Erica! Erica! to draw heat, because Eric Embry called the Puerto Rican fans [...] "greasy, slimy Puerto Ricans". He also insulted commentor and used-to-be referee from the <b>heel's</b> <b>side,</b> Hugo Savinovich, by calling him [...] "son of a bitch", instead of the correct last name, {{that led to a}} heated feud.|$|R
50|$|Foot {{maceration}} occur whenever exposed for prolong periods to moist conditions. Large watery blisters appear {{which are}} painful when they open {{and begin to}} peel away from the foot itself. The <b>heels,</b> <b>sides</b> and bony prominences are left with large areas of extremely sensitive, red tissue, exposed and prone to infection. As the condition worsens, more blisters develop due to prolonged dampness which eventually covers the entire heel and/or other large, padded sections of the foot, especially the undersides as well as toes. Each layer in turn peels away resulting in deep, extremely tender, red ulcerations.|$|R

50|$|In boardsports, {{the method}} grab is a tweaked {{form of the}} melon grab, where the rider grabs the <b>heel</b> <b>side</b> of the board between the {{bindings}} or at the front binding with the front hand.|$|E
50|$|To {{perform the}} method grab, the rider will begin by {{rotating}} their board 90 degrees to their backside (facing opposite {{the direction of}} travel). During or upon the rotation, the rider will grab {{the center of their}} board on the <b>heel</b> <b>side.</b> The rider may now revert to a normal position and land.|$|E
50|$|During {{the unit}} {{turmoil in the}} early parts of 2008, Horiguchi {{remained}} firmly on the <b>heel</b> <b>side</b> of Muscle Outlaw'z, and followed them to Real Hazard. He acted as secretary to the Brave Gate belt commissioner Yoshito Sugamoto, which was actually the Brave Gate champion (and his fellow MO'z stablemate) Gamma himself, enforcing the outrageous rules randomly put in place by him that allowed Gamma to win title matches or retain his title if he lost the match.|$|E
50|$|In April 2009, Nakamura turned <b>heel,</b> <b>siding</b> {{with the}} former members of GBH (especially Toru Yano) in a feud against Togi Makabe and Tomoaki Honma. This new group was soon named Chaos with Nakamura as their leader. Nakamura began to work a much rougher style, using a lot of knees and {{continuing}} to use a straight right hand as a frequent move {{in addition to the}} Bomaye, his new finisher. It was the Bomaye that took him to the finals of the 2009 G1 Climax, where he fell to Togi Makabe. Prior to the final Nakamura had gone undefeated, winning each match with the Bomaye. The move was also credited for fracturing IWGP Heavyweight Champion Hiroshi Tanahashi's orbital bone in the semi-finals of the G1, which forced Tanahashi to vacate the title later that month.|$|R

50|$|He {{would make}} his return as Bakery Yagi, costing Crazy MAX a match against the Italian Connection by whacking SUWA in the knee with a baguette. At this point, the Italian Connection was full of {{internal}} strife {{as to whether the}} stable was to be face or heel. As Bakery, he came down on the <b>heel</b> <b>side.</b> He began carrying loaves of bread to the ring, and using them as weapons in matches. When the ItaCon split, Yagi sided with the heels.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, the ItaCon {{was divided}} over the face/heel issue, with Kondo leading the <b>heel</b> <b>side.</b> He {{would lead the}} turn, briefly rename to Dotti Shuji, and soon after revert to his real name. He and Yasshi formed a group called Hagure Gundam (Rogue Corps in English) with fellow ItaCon member Shogo Takagi, and Toru Owashi. When Hagure Gundam was joined by Masaaki Mochizuki, it was renamed Aagan Iisou. Mochizuki would later be {{kicked out of the}} stable after he and Kondo feuded over who was leader, and Takuya Sugawara was added to the group.|$|E
50|$|The Volley was {{originally}} developed in 1939 as a tennis shoe by Adrian Quist, a famous Australian tennis player & employee of Dunlop. Adrian borrowed {{a pair of}} boat shoes (with Herringbone sole) during his Davis Cup tournament win in the USA and upon his return, convinced Dunlop to develop this high grip sports shoe. The original shoe was called the Volley OC (Orthopaedically Correct) and was worn by Rod Laver, Margaret Court, Evonne Goolagong Cawley, Ken Rosewall etc. The Volley OC continued up until the 1970s when it {{was replaced by the}} Volley International which featured the 3 stripe woven tape around the <b>heel,</b> <b>side</b> quarter panels which secure the tongue, and new look injection moulded rubber sole.|$|E
50|$|The Glacier was {{essentially}} an improved Wind-class icebreaker, {{larger and more}} powerful. Like them, her entire hull was designed for great strength. With a relatively short length {{in proportion to the}} great power developed, her bow had the characteristic sloping forefoot that enabled her to ride up on heavy ice and break it with the weight of the vessel. The stern was similarly shaped to facilitate breaking ice while backing down. The sides of the icebreaker were rounded, with marked tumble home, and she had fore, aft and <b>side</b> <b>heeling</b> tanks that enabled the ship to break free from ice by <b>heeling</b> from <b>side</b> to side and changing trim fore to aft. Diesel electric machinery was chosen for its controlability and resistance to damage.|$|R

50|$|The setup of {{this shot}} {{begins with the}} puck on the backhand <b>heel</b> <b>side</b> of the hockey stick. The puck {{location}} at this point will be even with or {{on the outside of}} the skate opposite of the intended direction of the shot. There will be a weight transfer from one skate to the other, also in the shot direction, when shot commences. At this time the puck will slide along the blade from the heel towards the toe with the eventual release of the puck toward the net. With a backhand shot it is much easier to release the puck from the middle of the blade, rather than the toe, because when shooting backhand the curve is in the opposite direction. The shooter does have some control over the direction of the backhand shot -- by pointing the stick blade during the follow through, the player can direct the action of the puck. This shot can obviously be used with a straight stick, but can have different shot results.|$|E
5000|$|The sample {{illustrated}} {{does not}} reach the line A1A1 on the 'heel edge' and the Y axis is not central to the shaft, {{which raises the question}} [...] "How is the stick positioned for measurement of permitted deviation." [...] The answer is that the vertical axis Y runs through the top centre of the handle and the stick is assumed to be suspended from that top centre point and perpendicular to the X axis (the ground), the curve {{to the base of the}} head of the stick being in contact with the ground, it is therefore not necessary for the Y axis to pass through the centre of the shaft just above the head of the stick, although in most traditional sticks it will do so (or very nearly do so—as 'rake' to the handle may cause the Y axis to run a few millimeters to the <b>heel</b> <b>side</b> of the true centre of the shaft). To October 2015 no official measuring method or device for measuring 'permitted deviation' has been approved by the FIH.|$|E

5000|$|Newer {{designs of}} wedges, {{especially}} the sand wedge, {{have changed the}} shape of the sole slightly to reduce the bounce along the <b>heel</b> (hosel <b>side)</b> and provide a more curved leading edge. This newer shape allows for the golfer to [...] "open" [...] the clubface for short, high-backspin chip shots that [...] "stick" [...] on the green or even roll backwards, without the wide heel lifting the bottom edge of the club at address or the additional angle providing too much bounce.|$|R
60|$|Thus admonished, the archer {{waved his}} gauntleted {{hand to his}} father, and digging his <b>heels</b> into the <b>sides</b> of his little pony soon drew up with the Squire. Nigel glanced over his {{shoulder}} and slackened speed until the pony's head was up to his saddle.|$|R
5000|$|It may {{be noted}} from the diagram above {{that no matter}} how [...] "tight" [...] the heel bend, {{reversing}} the stick head over the ball, with a [...] "traditional" [...] style hockey stick head, always requires both a vertical and horizontal adjustment of the stick head position. This is not anywhere near as difficult as it was with the very long head stick and this sort of adjustment will be almost sub-conscious in an experienced player. Note too, that when the shaft is held vertically, the ball is more securely stopped, when on the ground, to the toe side of the shaft rather than {{in the middle of the}} shaft. Novice players frequently assume that the centre of the ball will align with the centre of the shaft when stopping the ball in this way and as a result, the ball deflects off to the <b>heel</b> <b>side</b> and usually into their feet. Because of the heel slope on the stick head the vertical shaft stop is actually much easier to carry out securely (when the ball is on the ground) if the handle is held at least 10° off the vertical, with the top of the handle sloped to the player's left. When the ball in the air, a little off the ground, below knee height for example, is often easier to catch the ball correctly if the handle is vertical.|$|E
5000|$|It will be {{appreciated}} after {{a glance at}} the illustration of the 'English' style hockey stick that stopping a ball on the ground with the handle held vertically would not be easy. If the ball is lined up centrally with the centre of the handle (red) it would be likely to deflect off the <b>heel</b> <b>side</b> of the head. Even with the ball positioned central to the head (blue) stopping would not have been very secure with an upright handle. Presenting the stick at an angle of 35° or more (40° in the illustration) solves the problem of the ball running off the head by presenting a very long area behind the ball (relative to the width of the ball) but presents the problem of the best or optimum position to stop the ball for the following action. For hitting the optimum positions seems to be where a line projected through {{the leading edge of the}} shaft of the handle passes through the centre of the ball because it is the position closest to the centre line of the handle where the entire width of the head is behind the ball. Stopping the ball closer to the toe of the stick is acceptable but not optimal, as adjustment, which takes time, is necessary before the next intended action. [...] In the modern stick the vertical handle position is still not as secure as an angled presentation of the handle but the angle now can be considerably less, because of the tighter heel bend and the stopping and hitting positions of the ball are easier to determine. The line of the leading edge of the handle still projects close to the center of the ball when the angle of the stick handle is in the 30°-50° range and a line through the centre of the handle will project to the back and underside of the ball.|$|E
40|$|Feet {{displacement}} {{is recognized}} {{to be an}} important element in standing and is also linked to postural instability in elderly people with diabetes. This study investigates standing balance in diabetic patients in four asymmetric feet displacements. Quiet standing balance was investigated using the Biodex Balance System in 18 diabetic patients and compared with 18 control elderly subjects. The four standing conditions, namely, comfortable feet position, preferred feet position with a stance width of 17 [*]cm and 15 ° angle between the medial borders, feet side by side, and <b>heel</b> <b>side</b> by side with a 30 ° angle between medial edges of feet were evaluated (i. e. eyes opened, eyes closed). The overall stability was calculated by measuring anterior–posterior and medial–lateral indices in standing conditions. Differences among feet positions were compared using an analysis of variance and the independent t-test. The diabetic patients were unstable in the medial–lateral direction when standing with feet side by side versus <b>heel</b> <b>side</b> by side with a 30 ° angle between medial edges of feet (p[*]=[*] 0. 012 and 0. 011, respectively), while in controls the anterior–posterior stability scores between standing in preferred foot position with stance width of 17 [*]cm and 15 ° angle between the medial borders versus feet side by side, and <b>heel</b> <b>side</b> by side with a 30 ° angle between medial edges of feet versus preferred foot position with stance width of 17 [*]cm and 15 ° angle between the medial borders had significant difference (p...|$|E

2500|$|With his {{ownership}} reinstated, McMahon {{shifted his}} sights to, then babyface, Test, who was kayfabe dating Shane's sister, Stephanie. Shane disapproved of the relationship, feeling Stephanie was dating [...] "beneath the family's standards", {{and wound up}} feuding with Test. With help from the Mean Street Posse, McMahon made Test's life a living hell. At SummerSlam, McMahon met Test in a [...] "Love Her or Leave Her" [...] match, with the stipulation being that if McMahon won the match, Test and Stephanie {{could no longer see}} each other, and if he lost, McMahon would give his blessings to the pair. Test was able to get the win, and McMahon eventually settled his differences with Test, thus making his second face run by becoming his ally. As his father, Vince, then feuded with Triple H, Shane was attacked in early December 1999 by Triple H and D-Generation X (DX). He was thrown off the stage in a gang style attack, in which Billy Gunn and Road Dogg prevented members of the Corporation from saving Shane. Later in the year, Stephanie turned <b>heel,</b> <b>siding</b> with her new kayfabe husband then-heel, Triple H (the two began their off-screen relationship around this time, but did not marry in real life until 2003). With that, the McMahon-Helmsley Faction began, {{and all of the other}} McMahons disappeared from television.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Using {{physical}} wedges (PWs) {{to modify}} dose distribution and more homogeneous target coverage is a well-established technique. However, {{there are many}} problems with PWs known as beam hardening, which made them problematic. This can be overcome by dynamic wedges which do not filter beam. Comparison of physical properties of physical and enhanced dynamic wedges (EDWs) restricted to homogeneous medium. Hence, the main {{aim of this study}} is to compare dosimetric properties of physical and EDWs at bladder inhomogeneous phantom as a most common case implementing wedges. Materials and Methods: An inhomogeneous pelvic phantom with homogeneities of uterus, femur, soft tissue, rectum, and bladder was designed. Eclipse treatment planning system with the aim of bladder target was used for calculations. All dose distributions were measured with EBT 3 films. Results: Comparison between beam profiles of physical and EDWs at wedged and nonwedged directions shows a greater difference at near inhomogeneous soft tissue interface and also at <b>heel</b> <b>side</b> of wedges. Conclusion: Little difference observed between dose distribution of physical and EDWs shows neglectable effect of beam hardening produced by PW compared to EDW at inhomogeneous medium. Furthermore, EBT 3 films present good feature to measure dose distributions at EDW fields...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} some years, {{there has been}} a lot of {{discussion}} about the challenges in the field of heavy oil production in horizontal wells. The Autonomous Inflow control Valve (AICV), which has been developed by InflowControl AS, is self-regulated and does not require external force to control the flow. AICV is a very new technology which has the capacity to increase the recovery of heavy oil from horizontal wells. In this report, a computational study of a thin horizontal reservoir section with AICVs is presented, discussed and compared with the conventional ICDs. The near well reservoir section is modeled by using reservoir simulation software Rocx in combination with OLGA. Two different cases were simulated for a well section of 992 m. One case is with conventional ICD and another case is with AICV. Both cases were simulated with a differential pressure of 10 bar. The reservoir section considered in both cases is homogeneous with permeability 5 Da. The initial total oil production rate for both cases was 2500 m 3 /day. First, water breakthrough occurs in the <b>heel</b> <b>side</b> of the well due to heel-toe effect. When water break through occurs, the first AICV in the heel chokes the water production locally while the other AICVs are producing oil. In the similar manner, the other AICVs close locally after water breakthrough. Thus the water-cut is controlled and remains low. This gives a good representation of the AICV action and the recovery is increased. AICV can works reversibly also. The meaning is that the closed AICV starts to produce oil if it encounters higher concentration of oil. This reverse AICV action was observed in simulation after 10 days of production. The simulation shows that the recovery of heavy oil production with AICVs is increased by approximately 21 % compared to conventional ICDs...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the work presented in this thesis is to investigate {{the two sides of}} the flute, the face and the heel of a twist drill. The flute face was designed to yield straight diametral lips which could be extended to eliminate the chisel edge, and consequently a single cutting edge will be obtained. Since drill rigidity and space for chip conveyance have to be a compromise a theoretical expression is deduced which enables optimum chip disposal capacity to be described in terms of drill parameters. This expression is used to describe the flute <b>heel</b> <b>side.</b> Another {{main objective}} is to study the effect on drill performance of changing the conventional drill flute. Drills were manufactured according to the new flute design. Tests were run in order to compare the performance of a conventional flute drill and non conventional design put forward. The results showed that 50 % reduction in thrust force and approximately 18 % reduction in torque were attained for the new design. The flank wear was measured at the outer corner and found to be less for the new design drill than for the conventional one in the majority of cases. Hole quality, roundness, size and roughness were also considered as a further aspect of drill performance. Improvement in hole quality is shown to arise under certain cutting conditions. Accordingly it might be possible to use a hole which is produced in one pass of the new drill which previously would have required a drilled and reamed hole. A subsidiary objective is to design the form milling cutter that should be employed for milling the foregoing special flute from drill blank allowing for the interference effect. A mathematical analysis in conjunction with computing technique and computers is used. To control the grinding parameter, a prototype drill grinder was designed and built upon the framework of an existing cincinnati cutter grinder. The design and build of the new grinder is based on a computer aided drill point geometry analysis. In addition to the conical grinding concept, the new grinder is also used to produce spherical point utilizing a computer aided drill point geometry analysis...|$|E
