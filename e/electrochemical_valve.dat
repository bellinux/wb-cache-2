40|$|The system {{disclosed}} is {{for controlling}} the iodine {{level in a}} water supply in a spacecraft. It includes an iodine accumulator which stores crystalline iodine, an <b>electrochemical</b> <b>valve</b> to control the input of iodine to the drinking water and an iodine dispenser. A pump dispenses fluid through the iodine dispenser and an iodine sensor to a potable water tank storage. The iodine sensor electronically detects the iodine level in the water, and through electronic means, produces a correction current control. The correction current control operates the electro-chemical iodine valve to release iodine from the iodine accumulator into the iodine dispenser...|$|E
40|$|Porous anodic oxide (PAO) {{films are}} grown by <b>electrochemical</b> {{oxidation}} of <b>valve</b> metals in baths that dissolve the oxide. The self-organized hexagonal patterns of pores in these films {{have led to}} many investigations of PAO-based devices. However, the mechanisms of pore formation and ordering {{have not yet been}} fully explained. Recent experimental and modeling results indicate the importance of plastic flow during growth of self-ordered PAO. 1 Here we investigated the origin of stress driving plastic flow, and the possible role of stress in the morphological instability leading to pore formation. We report the first measurements of the evolution of stress distributions in barrier anodic oxide layers on Al, just prior to the appearance of pores. In situ stress measurements were carried out with th...|$|R
40|$|An <b>electrochemical</b> {{microbial}} check <b>valve</b> method (EC-MCV) {{for controlling}} the iodine disinfectant in potable water (PW) for NASA's space operations was proposed. The factors affecting {{the design and}} performance of the unit were analyzed. This showed {{that it would be}} feasible to construct a recyclable unit in a small volume that will operate in either an iodine removal or addition mode. The EC-MCV should remove active iodine species rapidly from PW, but the rapid delivery rates at end-use may make complete removal of excess I(-) difficult under some conditions. Its performace change with AgI buildup needs to be investigated, as this controls the time for recycling the unit. The EC-MCV has advantages over the passive microbial check valve (MCV) method currently in use, as it would allow precise control of the I 2 level and would not introduce excess I(-) to the water. The presence of oxygen in the EC-MCV needs to be investigated as it could affect the efficiency of I 2 addition and excess I(-) removal...|$|R
