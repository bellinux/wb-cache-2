500|$|Traditional Indian {{society is}} {{sometimes}} defined by social hierarchy. The Indian caste system embodies {{much of the}} social stratification {{and many of the}} social restrictions found in the Indian subcontinent. Social classes are defined by thousands of endogamous hereditary groups, often termed as jātis, or [...] "castes". India declared untouchability to be illegal in 1947 and has since enacted other anti-discriminatory laws and social welfare initiatives. At the workplace in urban India and in international or leading Indian companies, the caste related identification <b>has</b> <b>pretty</b> much lost its importance.|$|E
500|$|Because Kapoor and Chopra were {{starring}} {{together for}} the first time, Anjaana Anjaani {{was one of the most}} anticipated films of the year. [...] Exclusive stills from the film were released to the media on 4 October 2010. Chopra released a one-minute teaser trailer on 6 August 2010 on her Twitter account. It received positive feedback from critics and audiences, many calling it promising.

[...] Following the teaser release the first trailer appeared on 9 August 2010. The film's first song was released around the same time.|$|E
500|$|UT {{fans were}} unhappy with ABC's {{television}} {{coverage of the}} event. The network elected {{to stick with the}} Oklahoma vs. Texas A game instead of switching to the Kansas vs. Texas game. ABC stayed with the Oklahoma vs. A game through the final down and then ran threefull minutes of commercials while the Texas vs. Kansas game continued. By the time they switched over Texas was already leading 14–0. The ABC announcers started their coverage saying [...] "And now, we'll join the game you've been waiting for all week, which <b>has</b> <b>pretty</b> much already been decided." [...] ABC then broke away from their coverage at halftime to broadcast other events. This left thousands of UT fans who assembled to watch the game in Darrell K. Royal – Texas Memorial Stadium stranded without coverage for much of the game.|$|E

Liam Gallagher {{collected}} the award alone before presenting his speech, which thanked Bonehead, McGuigan and Alan White but not his brother, Noel. Liam threw his microphone and the band's award into the crowd. On 15 March 2010, Liam defended his actions at the awards ceremony, saying [...] "I'm sick of it all being about me and Noel, {{the last couple of}} months <b>has</b> <b>pretty</b> much been all about me and him so I thought it was only right to mention the other lads who played on the album and the best fans in the world," [...] and [...] "I thought it was a nice gesture to give this to the fans, obviously it was misinterpreted as per usual."

500|$|Lyrically [...] "I Don't Give A" [...] {{describes}} {{a day in}} the life of Madonna, with the singer working through her schedule. The verses during the chorus are representative of how Madonna had previously ignored her detractors, instead choosing to express it with her music with the lines, [...] "I'm moving fast, Can you follow my track, I'm livin' fast, And I like it like that, I do ten things all at once, And if you have a problem, I don't give a." [...] During the bridge, the lyrics presumably talks about a marriage which did not work out for unknown reasons, [...] "I tried to be a good girl/ I tried to be your wife/ I diminished myself/ And I swallowed my light." [...] Many critics agreed that the song <b>has</b> <b>pretty</b> direct lyrics that seem to take aim at her ex-husband, film director Guy Ritchie. However, when asked if Ritchie was indeed the subject of the song, Madonna's representative Liz Rosenberg added that [...] " [...] has not explained the lyrics and if they are about someone specifically ... I appreciate that people will speculate." [...] The song ends with Minaj uttering the final line, [...] "There's only one queen and that's Madonna. Bitch!" ...|$|E
500|$|Nichols guest {{starred in}} three episodes of CBS's Criminal Minds, and was then {{promoted}} {{as a series}} regular. Her role was Ashley Seaver, an FBI cadet assigned to the BAU. The casting choice came amid uproar from the series' fanbase as she {{was brought in to}} replace exiting actresses A.J. Cook and Paget Brewster; she told Parade magazine that the show' fans at first [...] "hated" [...] her, with many sending her hate messages through Twitter, because [...] " [...] they were very angry about [...] situation." [...] However, as the season went on, viewers eventually gave her character a warm reception. [...] "It just kind of worked. It was a long process," [...] she said. It was later informed that Nichols had been let go from the show. Nichols next starred in the indie drama-romance feature A Bird of the Air (formerly known as The Loop), where she played Fiona [...] "a librarian who joins a highway patrolman to uncover the mysteries behind the cryptic sayings spoken by an ancient parrot." [...] She described the film as a [...] "quirky, edgy love story" [...] and felt that playing her role [...] "was great for me, because [...] is a departure from some of the roles I've been offered". It was released in selected theaters on September 23, 2011, to mixed reviews; while The New York Times remarked that the actress [...] "is consistently appealing in the kind of role Zooey Deschanel <b>has</b> <b>pretty</b> much cornered", Village Voice felt her character was [...] "a grating twit" [...] in her hands.|$|E

But since then, razz <b>has</b> <b>pretty</b> much permeated the culture. We couldn't {{have done it without}} Hollywood's help." [...] Wilson is referred to as [...] "Ye Olde Head Razzberry". The ceremony's program is modeled after the Academy Awards, but is [...] "deliberately low-end and tacky".

2500|$|The Jezabels {{formed in}} 2007 after the four members met as {{students}} at the University of Sydney. Their music was described by national youth radio station, Triple J, as a blend of alternative rock, indie rock, and disco pop. The Jezabels' Facebook page describes their genre as [...] "intensindie". Hayley Mary (born Hayley Frances McGlone) and Heather Shannon both went to Byron Bay High School and had performed together as a folk duo in Byron Bay. Samuel Lockwood also grew up in Byron Bay. The band's name {{is based on the}} biblical character, Jezebel, who Mary perceived as being [...] "misunderstood or misrepresented" [...] and described her as [...] "an example of how women are really wrongly presented". Lockwood recognised Mary and Shannon when he saw them at university and invited them to join a band for a competition. The group are Nik Kaloper on drums and percussion, Sam Lockwood on lead guitar, Hayley Mary on lead vocals and Heather Shannon on piano and keyboard. Mary recalled: [...] "It was a combination of four individual desires to play music and taking whatever opportunities we could find — which happened to be each other ...

2500|$|King of Hearts {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} most music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 77, based on 12 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Allmusic editor Andy Kellman called it [...] "clearly the singer’s best album yet [...] his most unified set of songs", adding that [...] "Lloyd <b>has</b> <b>pretty</b> much perfected {{the art of}} transcending the modern-R Lothario cliché". Maura Johnston of The Village Voice described the album as [...] "utterly replayable" [...] and commented that it [...] "veers {{back and forth between}} unabashed romanticism , club-borne lust , and the brooding, yet unleashed love songs that helped him initially break onto the scene". The A.V. Clubs Evan Rytlewski complimented Polow da Don's material for Lloyd and wrote that the album [...] "doubles down on his amorous enthusiasm, pushing it to such delirious extremes that these songs feel risky and uncharted even as they play to his most obvious strengths". Glenn Gamboa of Newsday called it [...] "ambitious" [...] and commended Lloyd as [...] "a bold thinker and a skillful singer". Pitchfork Media's David Drake praised [...] "the chemistry of Lloyd with producer Polow da Don", writing that [...] "his work is primarily devoted to underlining Lloyd's vocals for maximum impact."

2500|$|The MDNA Tour has {{received}} positive reviews. A journalist from The Jerusalem Post described {{the show in}} Tel Aviv as an [...] "assault on the senses". He further comments, [...] "Despite the confused ideas underlying the performance, it's difficult to imagine somebody not enjoying a Madonna concert. Say what you will about the Kabbalah-studying, gun-toting, fashionista of pop music– and everyone has something to say– but the woman knows how {{to put on a}} good show". Jon Parales from The New York Times wrote that [...] "the concert is a display of energy and nutty inventiveness, with Madonna costumed as everything from baton twirler to folk dancer", adding that it [...] "is less a story than an excellent excuse for extravagant, perpetually surprising production numbers involving more than three dozen performers, while it turns some of Madonna's past hits inside out." [...] New York Daily News called the show [...] "an idea-intensive, message-packed riddle wrapped in an enigma that must be seen to be believed", arguing that the show's risky artistry [...] "deserves praise." [...] German newspaper Berliner Morgenpost wrote: [...] "Madonna live in 2012 is still magical and unmatched", Newspaper El País said [...] "Madonna shows her intelligence, femininity and elegance in a danceable and spectacular show," [...] Shirley Halperin from The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "With three decades of superstardom under her belt, Madonna <b>has</b> <b>pretty</b> much perfected the art of mass entertainment with a hint of scandal. So {{it should come as no}} surprise, even in the Holy Land, that her show would open with a giant cross, the clang of a church bell and cloaked clergymen"; while the show was given a positive review, the fact that the tour contains many songs from the MDNA album was criticized. Saeed Saeed from The National states the performance in Abu Dhabi saw Madonna [...] "bearing her soul". He says, [...] "While her previous Sticky and Sweet tour saw her lightly poking fun at herself and her various musical guises throughout the years, this concert was at times brutally dark and suffocating and as much an emotional exorcism as a performance".|$|E
