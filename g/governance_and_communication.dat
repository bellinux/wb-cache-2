40|$|The {{annual reports}} by trade bodies such as FICCI and PriceWaterHouseCooper on the {{entertainment}} & media industry in India and extensive local {{media coverage of}} media growth provides {{a picture of a}} sector undergoing continuous transformation and change. This growth however is taking place within a policy environment that ironically is bereft of substantial policy. Both the Broadcast Bill and Convergence Bill have been shelved and unlike governance in the press sector that involves the oversight of regulatory and accountability bodies such as the Press Council of India, the governance of broadcasting is being carried out on an ad hoc basis and in a policy vacuum. It can be argued that no policy in itself amounts to a policy of sorts. This environment has been of particular benefit to the larger media houses who have used their economic and political muscle to strengthen their dominance in cross sectoral media markets. A clear winner in this jockeying for inter-sectoral media dominance is the Chennai-based Sun TV empire. In direct contrast, the over-regulated response by the government to opening up of the community radio sector does suggest that there are differing agendas related to the liberalizing of the media in India.

40|$|AbstractIn {{an era of}} {{increased}} human pressure on planet Earth, sound environmental governance regimes {{are more important than}} ever. Digital technologies are increasingly turned to by environmental regulators to aid <b>governance</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication.</b> We examine the ‘behind the scenes’ institutional dynamics of a public body in its digital information provision (specifically dynamic river level information). Based on in-depth interviews with staff across a large environmental regulator we have brought to light four pivotal areas of institutional dynamics: (1) institutional priority and path dependency; (2) management and resources; (3) institutional identity and interdepartmental dynamics; and (4) ability and willingness to change. We gained insight into explicit and covert barriers and opportunities in relation to digital information provision that are likely to occur in other public institutions too. Besides identified barriers that were of a technical, structural, managerial or cultural nature, arguably the most important barrier was conceptual, i. e. the prevalence of ‘efficiency and efficacy’ perspectives on information and communications technology (ICT) amongst staff, in which ICT is primarily perceived as a neutral solution in itself {{to a wide variety of}} issues. Opportunities were nonetheless present in the form of enthusiasm and some critical thinking about digital innovation among staff, and an emphasis on the importance of stakeholder inclusion in the design of ICT. We conclude that there is a need to connect institutional social learning with the development of ‘conceptual perspectives’ on ICT, in which ICT is not seen as a solution in itself, but as a set of tools in a wider transformational process, or as a lens to look at existing or new practices. This is more likely to strengthen cornerstones of contemporary environmental governance, such as improved information access and reconceptualisations of ‘traditional’ barriers of uncertainty, liability and distrust in relation to information provision...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the extent to which organizational infrastructure and institutional leadership facilitated or hindered institutionalizing service learning as pedagogy at a small health professions college. Through interviews and content and discourse analysis, we found that data supported the notion that service learning 2 ̆ 2 fit 2 ̆ 2 the mission, however, data also revealed some resistance to using service learning on the part of some faculty members and administrators. Consequently, <b>governance</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> channels appeared as barriers to institutionalization because the administration 2 ̆ 7 s words and deeds were incongruent. Nursing faculty 2 ̆ 7 S espoused values and actual behaviors were congruent thus forcing them to lead for change from the bottom of their College hierarchy. Increased research on service learning as pedagogy can be found in the literature (Elyer 2 ̆ 6 Giles, 1999; Furco, 2001; Giles 2 ̆ 6 Elyer, 1998; Weglarz 2 ̆ 6 Seybert, 2004). Service learning as pedagogy advocates for a combination of higher education curricula partnerships with community agencies by providing community services while creating learning centered, reflective environments for students. This pedagogical approach is particularly suited to nursing and to social work professions, typically female-dominated fields where much of service learning research was conducted (Hamner, Wilder, Avery, 2 ̆ 6 Byrd, 2002). Gilligan (1982) realized that women often make decisions based on their connection with others. Gelmon, Holland, and Shinnamon (1998) found that sustainability for service learning in curriculum was a direct relationship between faculty and community partners, not surprising given the natural interaction between health care providers and the community. The researchers also noticed that when service learning in curriculum thrived, a relationship existedbetween faculty involvement, academic leadership, and institutional commitment...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze and {{describe}} the nature of various aspects of policy making in three selected Newfoundland school boards. Particular attention was paid to the political components of policy and policy development, educational <b>governance</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> patterns. Superintendents, board chairmen, board members, senior administrators and program coordinators participated in the study. A questionnaire, adapted from one used by Coleman (1979), was administered to all participants. In addition, a structured interview was conducted with each superintendent and chairman. An overall response rate of 81 % was obtained. [...] Data collected from the questionnaire were analyzed in two parts. Part A was coded and means were calculated for each area of difficulty in policy making. Means for Part B indicated the response of each group toward the appropriate level of involvement for school board members, administrators and denominational representative in seven major policy areas. The structured interview data were recorded, coded and divided into areas of distinct response. A composite profile of each interviewee was then constructed around the major aspects of policy making. Finally, questions posed in the statement of the problem were answered. [...] Findings and conclusions from the study indicate that policy making in the three selected school boards tends to follow the rational mode. Hence, one is left to speculate on a possible closed system approach to policy making. Administrators play a dominant role in policy development with the superintendent being the primary initiator and presentor of policy issues. Response patterns from all groups give support to this practice. Although perceptions of a definition of policy are similar to those found in literature, descriptions of the nature of policy lead one to infer that existing policy more closely resembles administrative rules for day-to-day district operation. Communication patterns are largely formal with the superintendent acting as mediator in policy issues. [...] Recommendations for action included inservice for policy makers, the development of guidelines for policy making, written policy handbooks, graduate courses in policy studies and an examination of school board / interest group interactions. Recommendations for further study included an examination of the superintendent's position as well as existing relationships between various educational agencies, the nature of policy in school boards, the impact of interest group activity on educational policy making and political communication patterns...|$|E
40|$|Quality, patient safety, {{access and}} {{value for money}} are the {{principles}} on which current health policy is based. Within that policy, health services aim to provide efficient and effective care, {{as close to the}} patient’s home as possible, with a view to improved health outcomes and satisfaction for patients. Ours is a small country with increasing demands on our healthcare system. These demands include demographic changes, increased public expectations and inequalities in access to care. The changing nature of healthcare - new technologies and clinical specialisation - and financial and regulatory pressures from national and international bodies - add further challenges. The Irish healthcare system is being reformed to meet these challenges: primary, social and community delivered care is being optimised; the range of care delivered in hospitals and the manner of its delivery is changing. For instance, specialist and complex care is being centralised and there is an increasing use of day case procedures in all specialties. Also national clinical programmes have been established to improve and standardise patient care, by bringing together clinical disciplines and enabling them to share innovative ways of delivering greater benefits for patients. Acute hospitals, the focus of this report, are but one element of the healthcare landscape. We have a large number and range of acute hospitals in Ireland, each held in high esteem and accessed primarily by its local population for most of their hospital care. However, it is difficult to achieve the necessary reform and developments required of our hospitals while they exist in isolation one from another. The provision of quality, safe healthcare requires increasing levels of co-operation and overarching systems of clinical <b>governance</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication.</b> The formation of Irish acute hospitals into a small number of groups, each with its own governance and management, will provide an optimum configuration for hospital services to deliver high quality, safe patient care in a cost effective manner. Grouping hospitals will allow appropriate integration and improve patient flow across the continuum of care. Each grouping will include a primary academic partner which will stimulate a culture of learning and openness to change within the hospital group. These groups will lead in the future to the establishment of hospital trusts on a statutory basis and the introduction of Universal Health Insurance (UHI), a key commitment in the Programme for Government 2011. The report recommends what these groups should be, sets out a governance and management framework and recommends an open and transparent process for the appointment of chief executives of future hospital trusts...|$|E
