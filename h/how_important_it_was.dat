5|$|Jelling, in Denmark, is {{the largest}} royal {{memorial}} from the Viking Age and it was made by Harald Bluetooth in memory of his parents Gorm and Tyra, and in honour of himself. It {{was only one of}} the two large tumuli that contained a chamber tomb, but both barrows, the church and the two Jelling stones testify to <b>how</b> <b>important</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to mark death ritually during the pagan era and the earliest Christian times.|$|E
5|$|Majure {{was a man}} who {{yearned to}} please his passengers, and if he made them happy then he also made his airline happy. He had often spoken to friends about <b>how</b> <b>important</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> for him to get {{travelers}} to their destinations on time and how proud he was of USAir's on-time record. All the same, he was also portrayed as a by-the-book, cautious pilot.|$|E
500|$|Retrospective reviews {{have also}} been positive. Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times gave [...] "Rose" [...] {{four out of five}} stars in 2013, {{particularly}} praising Rose's fleshed-out life and how it welcomed in new viewers. While he noted [...] "minor gripes" [...] and felt the Autons' destruction was toned-down, he praised the direction and the performances and called it [...] "a blinding success". The A.V. Club reviewer Alasdair Wilkins gave the episode a grade of a B, also noting <b>how</b> <b>important</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> that Rose's world was shown first. He felt that some effects already seemed dated in 2013 and Jackie and Mickey were one-dimensional, but the episode succeeded above all else, especially in developing Rose and the Doctor's relationship and pointing out that Doctor Who is dangerous. In 2013, Ben Lawrence of The Daily Telegraph named [...] "Rose" [...] {{as one of the top}} ten Doctor Who stories set in the contemporary time.|$|E

500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in the subsequent press conference. Michael Schumacher broke into tears when asked if matching Ayrton Senna's number of victories {{meant a lot to}} him. He later regained his composure and spoke about <b>how</b> <b>important</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to maintain the life of the engine at the circuit. Michael Schumacher revealed that the cause of his emotion was of him thinking about Senna's death at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix and said that he was surprised at how the media reacted to the moment which said that Schumacher [...] "was human after all". Häkkinen revealed that his team made modifications to his car at his pit stop which contributed to him setting the fastest lap of the race. He also admitted that he was unable to catch Michael Schumacher due to the presence of the two Minardis which cost him time. Ralf Schumacher said he was not worried from being challenged by Verstappen and Zonta during the event because of the Williams's quick pace. He also was confident that Williams had confirmed itself as the third strongest team in Formula One.|$|E
500|$|Comparing Jack's {{relationship}} with Ianto to his romantic tension with Gwen, David-Lloyd states [...] "I think [...] different sorts of love or lust, {{as it might}} be, and I think that's an ongoing thing ... At the moment, I think there's two different sorts of love going on there." [...] He also states that he feels that Ianto's {{relationship with}} Jack is his first same-sex relationship, and doesn't feel that Ianto would be a [...] "labelist", but were he, he would identify as bisexual, but that he [...] "wouldn't regard himself {{the same way as}} Jack does because they're from different times." [...] Author Stephen James Walker feels sorry for Ianto, perceiving his relationship with Jack as a one-sided one. To him, Ianto views the relationship as [...] "serious and committed", as seen in [...] "A Day in the Death" [...] where he tells Owen that it is not just about sex. However, from dialogue in [...] "Something Borrowed", Walker believes that Jack appears to equate his relationship with Ianto to nothing more than a [...] "recreational activity". Walker also notes <b>how</b> <b>important</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> for Ianto when he cut in to dance with Jack, as {{this is the first time}} that his relationship with Jack is presented before the rest of the crew. The novel The House that Jack Built includes a scene where Gwen tries to clarify whether Ianto understands the nature of his relationship with Jack, saying [...] "You do know he's ...", which Ianto finishes [...] "Just a shag?" [...] before adding [...] "Yes I know. I can't help it, though. I've never been much good at casual." [...] In radio play [...] "The Dead Line", set just prior to series three, Ianto expounds his insecurities to Jack, who refutes them, confirming that his feelings for Ianto are real. When asked if the relationship will continue in series three, executive producer Julie Gardner replied, [...] "Yes, I like seeing them as a couple", while director Euros Lyn stated that [...] "the love story between Captain Jack and Ianto [...] to unfold" [...] in the third series. While Gareth David-Lloyd feels that the love story between Jack and Ianto was not fully resolved, which is [...] "part of the tragedy", the character and his relationship with Jack had been sufficiently explored in the third series for David-Lloyd to be [...] "happy to walk away from it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{have argued}} that the anthem is too male-centric. Lyrics such as [...] "Our manhood we pledge to thy liberty" [...] suggest the song was {{originally}} intended to be sung only by men. Amandala correspondent Naomi Burn suggested that [...] "manhood" [...] be replaced by [...] "honour" [...] so that the lyrics would have more relevance for women. It has also been noted that women are never mentioned in the anthem, only men. A 1998 survey of approximately 2,000 Belizean women asked <b>how</b> <b>important</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to include women in the national anthem. 14.6% answered [...] "most important", 19.7% answered [...] "somewhat important", and 63.4% answered [...] "not very important".|$|E

Butterfield's testimony lasted from 2 PM to 6:30 PM. [...] The four investigators swore themselves to secrecy, and agreed to tell only the Chief Counsel and Chief Minority Counsel to the Senate Watergate Committee. Chief Counsel Samuel Dash says he immediately informed his subordinate, Deputy Chief Counsel Rufus L. Edmisten, and then Democratic Senator Sam Ervin, chairman of the committee. Both Ervin and Dash realized <b>how</b> <b>important</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> politically to have had a Republican uncover the taping system.
