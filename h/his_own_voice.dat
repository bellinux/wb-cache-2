Recurring voice actors and writers Kirker Butler, Mark Hentemann, Danny Smith and Alec Sulkin made minor appearances in the episode.|$|E
5|$|Harald {{appears in}} a number of {{historical}} fiction books. Justin Hill's Viking Fire is the second in his Conquest Trilogy, and tells the life of Harald in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>voice.</b> He serves as the protagonist in two children's books by Henry Treece, The Last of the Vikings/The Last Viking (1964) and Swords from the North/The Northern Brothers (1967). He also appears as the protagonist in the trilogy The Last Viking (1980) by Poul Anderson, and in Byzantium (1989) by Michael Ennis, which chronicles Harald's career in the Byzantine Empire.|$|E
5|$|Seth MacFarlane voices {{four of the}} show's main {{characters}}: Peter Griffin, Brian Griffin, Stewie Griffin, and Glenn Quagmire. MacFarlane {{chose to}} voice these characters himself, believing {{it would be easier}} to portray the voices he had already envisioned than for someone else to attempt it. MacFarlane drew inspiration for the voice of Peter from a security guard he overheard talking while attending the Rhode Island School of Design. Stewie's voice was based on the voice of English actor Rex Harrison, especially his performance in the 1964 musical drama film My Fair Lady. MacFarlane uses <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>voice</b> while portraying Brian.|$|E

5|$|The {{complications}} kept Ebert {{off the air}} for {{an extended}} period of time. Ebert made his first public appearance since mid-2006 at Ebertfest on April 25, 2007. He was unable to speak, instead communicating through his wife. He returned to reviewing on May 18, 2007, when three of his reviews were published in print. In July 2007, he revealed that he was still unable to speak. Ebert adopted a computerized voice system to communicate, eventually using a copy of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>voice</b> created from his recordings by CereProc. In March 2010, his health trials and new computerized voice were featured on The Oprah Winfrey Show. Ebert later proposed a test to determine the realism of a synthesized voice.|$|E
5|$|Though Haley is ostensibly a ghostwriter on the Autobiography, modern {{scholars}} tend {{to treat}} him as an essential and core collaborator who acted as an invisible figure {{in the composition of}} the work. He minimized <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>voice,</b> and signed a contract to limit his authorial discretion in favor of producing what looked like verbatim copy. However, MalcolmX biographer Manning Marable considers this view of Haley as simply a ghostwriter as a deliberate narrative construction of black scholars of the day who wanted to see the book as a singular creation of a dynamic leader and martyr. Marable argues that a critical analysis of the Autobiography, or the full relationship between MalcolmX and Haley, does not support this view; he describes it instead as a collaboration.|$|E
5|$|Ann {{believes}} the {{figures to be}} the ghosts of Quint and Jessel, seeking to continue their passionate and violent sexual encounters through Miles and Flora. However, she is concerned to find that others apparently cannot see the ghosts. She then begins to suspect that Miles and Flora, having been groomed by and involved {{in the activities of}} Quint and Jessel, may be deliberately seeking to bring the pair back. She resolves to leave Bly, but, when saying goodbye to Miles, learns that he, too, sees the figures. Minutes after leaving, she asks to be taken back. Later, Ann panics, believing Miles and Flora to have left the house. She finds them by the lake, but they are playing roughly; when Miles pushes Flora's head under the water, Ann sees the pair as Quint and Jessel. She rushes to intervene, and grapples with the figure which alternates between Quint and Miles. When Ann repeatedly strikes Miles, Mrs Grose stops her, and Flora says that she no longer wishes to see Ann. After ordering the staff and Flora away from Bly, Ann waits with Miles to confront Quint. The pair are scared, but when Quint arrives Ann tells Miles to demand that Quint leave him alone. Miles (speaking with Quint's voice) shouts at Ann, but eventually (in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>voice)</b> tells the ghostly Quint that he wishes him to leave. Ann embraces Miles, whose body goes limp.|$|E

50|$|Acharya himself grew to find <b>his</b> <b>own</b> {{distinct}} <b>voice</b> in literature. Even Ajneya, when {{he first}} met Acharya, {{found it difficult to}} believe that the young man was the author of Ajneya ki kaavya Titirsha.|$|R

25|$|Boulainvilliers's {{study of}} Spinoza, as {{captured}} in the collected treatises published by Renée Simon (1973), shows an exceptional development from a basic criticism to an enlightened understanding marked by the incredibly generous {{way in which he}} let his opponent use <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>voice.</b>|$|E
25|$|In March 2011, Yonezu and 7 {{other musicians}} created Balloom, an {{independent}} music label for Internet musicians to widen their musical opportunities. Since the first meetings Yonezu {{had with the}} company, he intended to release music using <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>voice</b> and not Vocaloid software.|$|E

60|$|Peter told 'im, arter fust calling 'im {{some more}} names, because Ginger was past it, and when 'e'd {{finished}} old Sam said 'ow surprised {{he was at}} them for letting Bill do it, and told 'em how they ought to 'ave prevented it. He sat there talking as though 'e enjoyed the sound of <b>'is</b> <b>own</b> <b>voice,</b> and he told Peter and Ginger all their faults and said wot sorrow it caused their friends. Twice he 'ad to throw the bedclothes over their 'eads because o' the noise they was making.|$|R
5000|$|Texas Pete - An evil cowboy and {{the main}} villain of the series. His goals are {{generally}} simple-minded, be it world domination, the destruction of SuperTed, or simply increasing <b>his</b> <b>own</b> wealth. <b>Voiced</b> by Victor Spinetti.|$|R
25|$|While Walker and Ross' exit left {{a hole in}} the Panic! songwriting regime, the {{experience}} became the catalyst for Urie finding <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>voice</b> and the confidence to take over as the band's principal songsmith. The lyrics touch on themes of manipulation and confusion. Vices & Virtues took over two years to create, and the increased time in the studio brought forth new musical experimentation.|$|E
25|$|With Britten, Pears was {{a co-founder}} of the Aldeburgh Festival in 1947 and the Britten-Pears School in 1972. After Britten died in 1976, Pears {{remained}} {{an active participant in}} the festival and the school, where he was director of singing. <b>His</b> <b>own</b> <b>voice</b> had a distinctive timbre, not to all tastes, but such was his musical skill that he could use the voice to good effect in many styles of music.|$|E
25|$|Diorama is {{the first}} album by Japanese {{musician}} Kenshi Yonezu, which was released on May 16, 2012. It was the first studio album released under his real name, {{and the first to}} use <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>voice</b> as opposed to his Vocaloid albums released under the name Hachi. The album was one of the top independent releases in Japan in 2012, {{and was one of the}} winners of the 5th CD Shop Awards.|$|E
6000|$|He {{was silent}} for some moments; then, {{collecting}} himself, and looking fixedly at Guy, he said, in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> steady <b>voice,</b> though very feeble,--'I suppose, humanly speaking, it is an even chance between life and death?' ...|$|R
50|$|Johnson joined Live & Kicking at {{the start}} of series 3 as the {{voice-over}} man who lived in the cupboard and was never seen on air. His voice was already well known with listeners to Virgin Radio where he presented a show of <b>his</b> <b>own.</b> <b>His</b> <b>voice</b> has since featured on several other BBC shows including Friends Like These, Children in Need, The National Lottery, Record Breakers and Comic Relief.|$|R
50|$|Fentress went on {{to another}} New York based firm, KPF (Kohn Pedersen Fox) Architects, {{continuing}} his interest in large scale public and private buildings. KPF had an approach that factored in context as Fentress was finding <b>his</b> <b>own</b> distinctive <b>voice.</b>|$|R
25|$|He {{returned}} to Paris in 1937 as an exchange student {{to work on}} his doctoral thesis on the idea of order in the work of Thomas Aquinas. In 1938, Coffey's second volume of poetry, Third Person, was published by George Reavey's Europa Press. He also contributed translations to the same publisher's Thorns of Thunder (1936), the first collection of Paul Éluard's work published in English. The poems of this period saw Coffey shake off his earlier influences and begin to find <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>voice,</b> but, for a variety of reasons, Third Person was to be his last poetry publication for a quarter century.|$|E
25|$|Ginsberg showed {{this poem}} to Kenneth Rexroth, who criticized it as too stilted and academic; Rexroth {{encouraged}} Ginsberg to free {{his voice and}} write from his heart. Ginsberg took this advice and attempted to write a poem with no restrictions. He was under the immense influence of William Carlos Williams and Jack Kerouac and attempted to speak with <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>voice</b> spontaneously. Ginsberg began the poem in the stepped triadic form he took from Williams but, {{in the middle of}} typing the poem, his style altered such that his own unique form (a long line based on breath organized by a fixed base) began to emerge.|$|E
25|$|Pierce {{is known}} for his {{distinctive}} voice and, like his Frasier co-star, Kelsey Grammer, is often called upon to provide voice work. His notable roles include the narrator of the movie The Mating Habits of the Earthbound Human in 1999, walking stick insect Slim in A Bug's Life, Doctor Delbert Doppler in Disney's film Treasure Planet, and the amphibian Abe Sapien in Hellboy. Pierce refused credit for his Hellboy role because he felt it was the performance of Doug Jones, and not <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>voice,</b> which ultimately brought the character of Abe Sapien to life. He was the voice for Drix, a cold pill, in the animated comedy Osmosis Jones.|$|E
50|$|During editing, filmmakers {{tried to}} remake Hawking's {{synthesised}} voice, {{but it did}} not turn out as they wanted. Hawking enjoyed the film enough that he granted them permission to use <b>his</b> <b>own</b> synthesised <b>voice,</b> which is heard in the final film.|$|R
50|$|A Jimmy Fallon sketch. Debuted November 2, 2002. Fallon plays Joey Mack, an obnoxious radio DJ who {{has special}} guests on his show, but almost never lets them talk on air {{because he is}} too preoccupied with <b>his</b> <b>own</b> comic <b>voices.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Scott Yanow awarded the album 4 stars stating [...] "This early {{recording}} finds Redman discovering <b>his</b> <b>own</b> individual <b>voice</b> on {{five of his}} frequently emotional originals... this San Francisco date is quite adventurous and holds one's interest throughout".|$|R
25|$|Aside from {{residing}} {{with his}} father as he strove to find <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>voice</b> and work out his philosophical ideas, Hazlitt also stayed over with his older brother John, who had studied under Joshua Reynolds and was following {{a career as a}} portrait painter. He also spent evenings with delight in London's theatrical world, an aesthetic experience that would prove, somewhat later, of seminal importance to his mature critical work. In large part, however, Hazlitt was then living a decidedly contemplative existence, one somewhat frustrated by his failure to express on paper the thoughts and feelings that were churning within him. It was at this juncture that Hazlitt met Samuel Taylor Coleridge. This encounter, a life-changing event, was subsequently to exercise a profound influence on his writing career that, in retrospect, Hazlitt regarded as greater than any other.|$|E
25|$|Not {{knowing how}} to play or compose music did not stop António from making music by himself. He would, using a tape recorder, {{mimicking}} sounds and rhythms while he sang, using <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>voice</b> or even tapping his hands on different objects. These recordings were then used by his supporting studio musicians {{as the basis for}} the song arrangements. Variações' music is characterized by the use of a variety of instruments, ranging from synthesizers, to Portuguese and classical guitars, to accordions and more. Defying genre definition, he created his own description for his sound: something between Braga and New York, reflecting the cosmopolitan, yet down to earth and rural aspect of his eclectic style. He was intent on becoming a popular artist in the true sense of the word and he managed to reach audiences which were very diverse, from the blue collar to the white collar workers, to the uneducated and the intellectuals, to young and old alike.|$|E
25|$|He spoke English, French, Spanish, Italian, German, and Russian fluently, {{as well as}} some Turkish {{and modern}} Greek. He was {{proficient}} in accents and dialects in all his languages. Ustinov provided his own German and French dubbing for some of his roles, both for Lorenzo's Oil. As Hercule Poirot, he provided <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>voice</b> for the French versions of Thirteen at Dinner, Dead Man's Folly, Murder in Three Acts, Appointment with Death and Evil under the Sun but, unlike Jane Birkin, who had dubbed herself in French for both this film and Death on the Nile, Ustinov did not provide his voice for the latter (his French voice being provided by Roger Carel, who had already dubbed him in Spartacus and other films). He dubbed himself in German as Poirot only in Evil under the Sun (his other Poirot roles being undertaken by no less than three different actors). On the other hand, he provided only his German voice for Disney's Robin Hood and NBC's Alice in Wonderland.|$|E
60|$|He didn't at all {{mind the}} {{disorder}} and rancid {{smell of the}} cage; he had no fear of the tiger's sleek murderous power. But he was somewhat afraid of the sound of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> tremorous <b>voice.</b> He had spoken aloud so little lately.|$|R
