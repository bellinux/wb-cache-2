5|$|Both {{enemies and}} their bullets can be shot down. Defeating enemies will {{sometimes}} reveal item boxes, which can hold precious metals such as {{gold and silver}} for extra points, and bombs. Only five bombs can be held at a time, {{which can be used}} to clear the screen of enemies. Weapon upgrades may appear after defeating certain enemies. These weapons, such as shotguns and machine guns, will increase the player's <b>firing</b> <b>speed</b> or damage output. When a player's bullets hit an enemy, a gauge {{at the bottom of the}} screen will gradually fill. Once filled, the player will be awarded with a Vulcan gun, the most powerful weapon in the game which grants invincibility. The gauge will then begin to deplete and the Vulcan gun will disappear once empty.|$|E
5|$|Each planet {{offers a}} {{possible}} quest or {{challenge to the}} player. Challenges are tactical battles in which the player must fight against a variety of enemies. However, ships can only be harmed from behind or below; attacks from any other position will be countered by the ships' shields. Upon succeeding, a new chapter {{is added to the}} player's character's story, and the player is rewarded with ship upgrades. These upgrades are used to customize ships with improvements, such as increased <b>firing</b> <b>speed</b> or heavier rear armor. The upgrades available to the player upon finishing each encounter with an enemy can vary, so the player may not receive the same upgrade by playing the same encounter in two different adventures. Flotilla has cooperative and split-screen multiplayer modes that can be played with an additional Xbox 360 controller.|$|E
25|$|As the <b>firing</b> <b>speed</b> is {{increased}} beyond this, non-interrupted elliptic orbits are produced; one {{is shown in}} (D). If the initial firing is above {{the surface of the}} Earth as shown, there will also be non-interrupted elliptical orbits at slower firing speed; these will come closest to the Earth at the point half an orbit beyond, and directly opposite the firing point, below the circular orbit.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{approximate}} discrete-event systems {{in which there}} exist considerable states and events, David and Alla define a continuous Petri net (CPN). So far, CPNs have been a useful tool not only for approximating discrete-event systems but also for modelling continuous processes. Due to different ways of calculating instantaneous <b>firing</b> <b>speeds</b> of transitions, various continuous Petri net models, such as the CCPN (constant speed CPN), VCPN (variable speed CPN) and the ACPN (asymptotic CPN), have been proposed, where the continuous flow is specified uniquely by maximal <b>firing</b> <b>speeds.</b> However, in applications such as chemical processes there exist situations where the continuous flow must be above some minimal speed or {{in the range of}} minimal and maximal speeds. In this paper, {{from the point of view}} of approximating a time Petri net, the CPN is augmented with maximal and minimal <b>firing</b> <b>speeds,</b> and a novel continuous model, i. e., the Interval speed CPN (ICPN) is defined. The enabling and firing semantics of transitions of the ICPN are discussed, and the facilitating of continuous transitions is classified into three levels: 0 -level, 1 -level and 2 -level. Some policies to resolve the conflicts and algorithms to undertake the behavioural analysis for the ICPN are developed. In addition, a chemical process example is presented...|$|R
25|$|If the {{cannonball}} {{is fired}} with sufficient speed, the ground curves {{away from the}} ball {{at least as much}} as the ball falls – so the ball never strikes the ground. It is now in what could be called a non-interrupted, or circumnavigating, orbit. For any specific combination of height above the center of gravity and mass of the planet, there is one specific <b>firing</b> <b>speed</b> (unaffected by the mass of the ball, which is assumed to be very small relative to the Earth's mass) that produces a circular orbit, as shown in (C).|$|E
500|$|Some {{characters}} who previously appeared in War for Cybertron feature updated appearances and transformation schemes, or moving parts that animate regardless of player action, similar to breathing. The character Optimus Prime was redesigned for a [...] "more warrior-type feel", with more bulk {{added to his}} body mass. The weaponry in Fall of Cybertron was also modified and enhanced; the designers of the game put out a call {{to everyone in the}} studio for new weapon ideas. Matt Tieger of High Moon explained that in addition to new designs, each weapon could be upgraded, continuing, [...] "We really made a conscious choice to make every upgrade a significant improvement, so one upgrade might increase your <b>firing</b> <b>speed</b> by 75%. We could have made the system so {{that there were a lot}} of upgrades that each improved your guns a little bit, but we wanted to make each upgrade feel like this giant thing. That way when players buy it they’re really going to feel the difference." ...|$|E
2500|$|At a {{specific}} horizontal <b>firing</b> <b>speed</b> called escape velocity, {{dependent on the}} mass of the planet, an open orbit (E) is achieved that has a parabolic path. At even greater speeds the object will follow a range of hyperbolic trajectories. In a practical sense, both of these trajectory types mean the object is [...] "breaking free" [...] of the planet's gravity, and [...] "going off into space" [...] never to return.|$|E
30|$|For {{our three}} {{wildlife}} functional groups, {{the other four}} fire regime characteristics: size, rate of spread, intensity, and season, seem immediately significant during a fire, particularly for the animals that shelter in place. Changing <b>fire’s</b> <b>speed</b> or intensity may overheat soil-insulated animals. An increase in <b>fire</b> size or <b>speed</b> may make escape or recolonization impossible for large- or medium-sized animals. Possibly the most damaging, a change in fire season may affect vulnerable stages of nest building, offspring rearing, or juvenile survival for all three wildlife functional groups.|$|R

2500|$|If {{the cannon}} fires its ball {{with a low}} initial speed, the {{trajectory}} of the ball curves downward and hits the ground (A). As the <b>firing</b> <b>speed</b> is increased, the cannonball hits the ground farther (B) away from the cannon, because while the ball is still falling towards the ground, the ground is increasingly curving away from it (see first point, above). All these motions are actually [...] "orbits" [...] in a technical sense – they are describing a portion of an elliptical path around {{the center of gravity}} – but the orbits are interrupted by striking the Earth.|$|E
2500|$|Electrical sensors (EMG) {{inserted}} into affected muscle groups, while painful, {{can provide a}} definitive diagnosis by showing pulsating nerve signals being transmitted to the muscles {{even when they are}} at rest. The brain appears to signal portions of fibers within the affected muscle groups at a <b>firing</b> <b>speed</b> of about 10Hz causing them to pulsate, tremble and contort. When called upon to perform an intentional activity, the muscles fatigue very quickly and some portions of the muscle groups do not respond (causing weakness) while other portions over-respond or become rigid (causing micro-tears under load). The symptoms worsen significantly with use, {{especially in the case of}} focal dystonia, and a [...] "mirror effect" [...] is often observed in other body parts: Use of the right hand may cause pain and cramping in that hand as well as in the other hand and legs that were not being used. Stress, anxiety, lack of sleep, sustained use and cold temperatures can worsen symptoms.|$|E

50|$|A modern {{battery of}} six guns, each firing 43 kg {{projectiles}} with a burst <b>firing</b> <b>speed</b> of four rounds per minute, can deliver over a metric tonne of ordnance per minute {{for up to}} four minutes.

40|$|Diversity {{effects on}} {{many aspects of}} {{ecosystem}} function have been well documented. However, fire is an exception: fire experiments have mainly included single species, bulk litter, or vegetation, and, as such, the role of diversity as a determinant of flammability, a crucial aspect of ecosystem function, is poorly understood. This study {{is the first to}} experimentally test whether flammability characteristics of two-species mixtures are non-additive, i. e., differ from expected flammability based on the component species in monospecific fuel. In standardized fire experiments on ground fuels, including monospecific fuels and mixtures of five contrasting subarctic plant fuel types in a controlled laboratory environment, we measured flame speed, flame duration, and maximum temperature. Broadly half of the mixture combinations showed non-additive effects for these flammability indicators; these were mainly enhanced dominance effects for temporal dynamics - <b>fire</b> <b>speed</b> and duration. Fuel types with the more flammable value for a characteristic determined the rate of <b>fire</b> <b>speed</b> and duration of the whole mixture; in contrast, maximum temperature of the fire was determined by the biomass-weighted mean of the mixture. These results suggest that ecological invasions by highly flammable species may have effects on ground-fire dynamics well out of proportion to their biomass. © 2012 van Altena, van Logtestijn, Cornwell and Cornelissen...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Reliability {{analysis}} for reparable multi-components systems {{is based on}} stochastic discrete event models like Markov models or Stochastic Petri Nets (SPNs). When the number of components increases, the analytical expression of the steady state is tedious to work out because of the combinatory explosion with discrete models. For this reason, fluidification is investigated to estimate the asymptotic behaviour of the stochastic processes with Continuous Petri Nets (CPNs). The contributions of this paper are {{to point out the}} limits of the CPNs to approximate the stochastic steady state and to propose continuous Petri nets with piecewise-constant maximal <b>firing</b> <b>speeds</b> for fluidification...|$|R
50|$|The {{time that}} the chain takes to move around a {{complete}} loop of the rectangle controls the rate of fire, so varying the motor speed allows chain guns, in principle, to fire at a rate continuously variable from single rounds to the maximum safe rate imposed by the pressure drop rates in the barrel after firing a cartridge, mechanical tolerances, and other factors. For example, the 7.62mm NATO version EX-34 was advertised to offer 570 rounds per minute, and developmental work was underway for a 1,000-rounds-per-minute version. In practice, chain guns usually {{have two or three}} set <b>firing</b> <b>speeds.</b>|$|R

One was to greatly increase the <b>firing</b> <b>speed</b> of the 40 while also incorporating any minor changes that would improve its range. This produced the 40mm L70, which remains popular to this day. The other was to design a larger weapon with much greater effective range and a larger explosive load that offset a lower firing rate. This {{was based on the}} existing 57 mm lvakan M/50 design, likewise upgraded for more range and higher firing rates. This design became the 57 mm L70 gun.|$|E
