5|$|Two visiting Wasco County commissioners were {{poisoned}} with <b>glasses</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> containing Salmonella bacteria {{during a}} visit to Rajneeshpuram on August 29, 1984. Both men fell ill and one was hospitalized. Afterward, members of Sheela's team spread Salmonella on produce in grocery stores and on doorknobs and urinal handles in the county courthouse, but this did not produce the desired effects. In September and October 1984, they contaminated the salad bars of 10 local restaurants with Salmonella, infecting 751people. Forty-five people received hospital treatment; all survived.|$|E
5|$|At bedtime on Christmas Eve, {{the family}} makes last-minute {{preparations}} at home, Marge tells everyone {{that no one}} can open presents until 7 AM and confiscates all of the alarm clocks. However, Bart drinks 12 <b>glasses</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> to wake up early and secretly unwraps his gifts, one of which is a remote-controlled fire truck. Bart plays with it until it sprays water on an overloaded electrical socket, causing a fire that engulfs and melts the plastic Christmas tree and all of the presents beneath it. Bart hides the evidence outside beneath the snow in the front yard.|$|E
5|$|Having {{previously}} gained {{political control}} of Antelope, Oregon, Rajneesh's followers, who were based in nearby Rajneeshpuram, sought election {{to two of}} the three seats on the Wasco County Circuit Court that were up for election in November 1984. Fearing they would not gain enough votes, Rajneeshpuram officials decided to incapacitate voters in The Dalles, the largest population center in Wasco County. The chosen biological agent was Salmonella enterica Typhimurium, which was first delivered through <b>glasses</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> to two County Commissioners and then, on a larger scale, at salad bars and in salad dressing.|$|E

50|$|Therefore, any {{particular}} unit <b>of</b> <b>water</b> becomes worth less to people as the supply <b>of</b> <b>water</b> increases. On the other hand, diamonds are in much lower supply. They are of such low supply that {{the usefulness of}} one additional diamond {{is greater than the}} usefulness <b>of</b> one additional <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> which is in abundant supply. Thus, diamonds are worth more to people. Therefore, those who want diamonds are willing to pay a higher price for one diamond than for one <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> and sellers <b>of</b> diamonds ask a price for one diamond that is higher than for one <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{centrifugal}} railways {{built in}} the 1840s were extensively tested before allowing human riders. The operators of the Railways tested the rides {{with a variety of}} things occupying the cars, including egg crates, <b>glasses</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> flowers, sandbags, and even a monkey. Although the 1840s centrifugal railways had no reported safety issues, a later version built in 1865 at the Cirque Napoléon was quickly closed by police after the first car sent through the loop derailed.|$|E
25|$|The {{human body}} {{contains}} from 55% to 78% water, depending on body size. To function properly, the body requires {{between one and}} seven liters of water per day to avoid dehydration; the precise amount depends {{on the level of}} activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. Most of this is ingested through foods or beverages other than drinking straight water. It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people, though most specialists agree that approximately 2 liters (6 to 7 <b>glasses)</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> daily is the minimum to maintain proper hydration. Medical literature favors a lower consumption, typically 1 liter of water for an average male, excluding extra requirements due to fluid loss from exercise or warm weather.|$|E

25|$|At Cabinet on 15 June, Reynaud {{urged the}} Cabinet {{to adopt the}} Dutch example, that the Army should lay down its arms so that the fight could be {{continued}} from abroad; Pétain was sympathetic. Pétain was sent to speak to General Weygand (who was waiting outside, as {{he was not a}} member of the Cabinet). Weygand persuaded him that this would be a shameful surrender. Chautemps then suggested a fudge proposal, an inquiry about terms. The Cabinet voted 13-6 for the Chautemps proposal. Reynaud tried to resign on the spot but Lebrun shouted at him. Admiral Darlan, who had been opposed to an armistice until 15 June, now agreed, provided the French fleet was kept out of German hands. On 15 June, Reynaud threw two <b>glasses</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> over de Portes at dinner; a key telegram had been found in her bed after it went missing.|$|E
25|$|Greater than 75–95% of {{colorectal}} cancer occurs {{in people with}} little or no genetic risk. Risk factors include older age, male gender, high intake of fat, alcohol, red meat, processed meats, obesity, smoking, and a lack of physical exercise. Approximately 10% of cases are linked to insufficient activity. The risk from alcohol appears to increase at greater than one drink per day. Drinking 5 <b>glasses</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> a day is linked to a decrease in the risk of {{colorectal cancer}} and adenomatous polyps. Streptococcus gallolyticus is associated with colorectal cancer. Some strains of Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex are consumed by millions of people daily and thus may be safe. 25 to 80% of people with Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus bacteremia have concomitant colorectal tumors. Seroprevalence of Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus is considered as a candidate practical marker for the early prediction of an underlying bowel lesion at high risk population. It has been suggested that the presence of antibodies to Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus antigens or the antigens themselves in the bloodstream may act as markers for the carcinogenesis in the colon.|$|E
25|$|On April 4, 1975, Aquino {{announced}} that he was going on a hunger strike, a fast to the death to protest the injustices of his military trial. Ten days through his hunger strike, he instructed his lawyers to withdraw all motions he had submitted to the Supreme Court. As weeks went by, he subsisted solely on salt tablets, sodium bicarbonate, amino acids, and two <b>glasses</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> a day. Even as he grew weaker, suffering from chills and cramps, soldiers forcibly dragged him to the military tribunal's session. His family and hundreds of friends and supporters heard Mass nightly at the Santuario de San Jose in Greenhills, San Juan, praying for his survival. Near the end, Aquino's weight had dropped from 54 to 36 kilos. Aquino nonetheless was able to walk throughout his ordeal. On May 13, 1975, on the 40th day, his family and several priests and friends, begged him to end his fast, pointing out that even Christ fasted only for 40 days. He acquiesced, confident that he had made a symbolic gesture. But he remained in prison, and the trial continued, drawn out for several years. On November 25, 1977, the Military Commission charged Aquino along with NPA leaders Bernabe Buscayno (Commander Dante) and Lt. Victor Corpuz, guilty of all charges and sentenced them to death by firing squad. The death sentence was never carried out as Aquino's death sentence was commuted by President Marcos in May 1980.|$|E

500|$|The second {{music video}} for [...] "This Too Shall Pass" [...] was {{directed}} by James Frost. Similar to the band's video for [...] "Here It Goes Again", the [...] "This Too Shall Pass" [...] video features a four-minute, apparent one shot sequence of the song being played {{in time to the}} actions of a giant Rube Goldberg machine built in a two-story warehouse from over 700 household objects, traversing an estimated half-mile course. As the song and machine operate, the members of the band are seen singing alongside the machine, with the members being shot at by paint guns at the song's finale. Parts of the machine are synchronized in time with the music; in one instance, <b>glasses</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> are used to repeat part of the song's melody in the fashion of a glass harp. One part of the machine shows the [...] "Here It Goes Again" [...] video on a television before it is smashed by the machine. The MAKE magazine 1993 Ford Escort racecar, used for the 24 Hours of LeMons, appears in the video along with a miniature LEGO version of the car. Alongside the LEGO car, several LEGO mini-figurines are displayed as a reference to the marching band video.|$|E
500|$|Ali {{learned that}} his {{regurgitation}} talents {{had the potential to}} entertain and to earn money through performance at the age of fifteen:I tried out my tricks first of all in the street, swallowing many <b>glasses</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and then pouring forth a great fountain {{from one side of the}} road to the other... A cafe proprietor saw me doing this one day, and chased me down the street. I thought he wanted to beat me up, but no—all he did was to put a coin in my hand and ask me to repeat the trick. Finally, he was so delighted that he asked me to come to his cafe and entertain the customers. Taking his abilities on the road, Ali met an Italian man in Cairo who signed him to a contract for music hall performances. Ali performed under contract throughout Europe and at times for heads of state. According to Ali, in or about 1914 he was summoned by Tsar NicholasII of Russia to perform at the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg, Russia. He stated that the Tsar [...] "must have liked my performance because he awarded me a special decoration, which is now one of my most treasured possessions." [...] Following World War I, Ali began managing his own affairs and toured the world, learning more tricks as he went.|$|E
500|$|Capper had not died {{immediately}} as her murderers believed, {{and after}} they left she managed to scramble back up the embankment and stagger along the lane for approximately {{a quarter of a}} mile (400 m) to Compstall Road before being found at 06:10 by Barry Sutcliffe and two of his colleagues on their way to work. She told them: [...] "Over there, in the field. They burnt me, they put petrol on me." [...] They immediately took her to a nearby house and roused the residents, Michael and Margaret Coop, to call for an ambulance. Michael Coop said: [...] "Both her hands appeared like ash. Her legs were just like raw meat and her feet appeared to be badly charred. I was struck by how polite the victim was. She was constantly thanking my wife for her assistance." [...] Margaret Coop said: [...] "I instinctively went to put my arms around her but she pulled away because she could not bear to be touched. Her head was shaved and there were recent, not new, cuts to her head. Her face was almost featureless. Her hands were red raw and black at the fingertips. Her legs were red from top to bottom. She couldn't bear anything near her legs." [...] Capper drank six <b>glasses</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> but was unable to hold the glass herself because of the injuries to her hands. Margaret Coop said: [...] "She looked like the victim of an attack in the Vietnam war. But I felt she would survive. I had this theory that, now she had got to somewhere she could be helped, she would live." [...] Capper was rushed to the hospital and was able to give the names of her six assailants and Powell's address before falling into a coma. The extent of her burns was such that her mother and stepfather were unable to recognise her, and she was positively identified by a partial fingerprint from her thumb, the only part of her hands not severely burned. She died on 18 December 1992, without regaining consciousness.|$|E

2500|$|Early {{recommendations}} for the quantity of water required for maintenance of good health suggested that 6–8 <b>glasses</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> daily is the minimum to maintain proper hydration. However {{the notion that a}} person should consume eight <b>glasses</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> per day cannot be traced to a credible scientific source. The original water intake recommendation in 1945 by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council read: [...] "An ordinary standard for diverse persons is 1 milliliter for each calorie of food. Most of this quantity is contained in prepared foods." [...] More recent comparisons of well-known recommendations on fluid intake have revealed large discrepancies in the volumes of water we need to consume for good health. Therefore, to help standardize guidelines, {{recommendations for}} water consumption are included in two recent European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) documents (2010): (i) Food-based dietary guidelines and (ii) Dietary reference values for water or adequate daily intakes (ADI). [...] These specifications were provided by calculating adequate intakes from measured intakes in populations of individuals with “desirable osmolarity values of urine and desirable water volumes per energy unit consumed.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Synthesizing his Adventist beliefs {{with his}} {{scientific}} and medical knowledge, Kellogg created {{his idea of}} [...] "biologic living." [...] This {{was the idea that}} appropriate diet, exercise, and recreation was required in order to maintain a healthy body, mind, and soul. As such, the policies and therapies at the Battle Creek Sanitarium were very much in line with these principles of biologic living, such as the focus on vegetarianism or drinking 8-10 <b>glasses</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> a day. In fact, his belief that biologic living would protect his health was so strong that he did not even feel it necessary to get vaccinated against smallpox.|$|E
2500|$|For {{those who}} have healthy kidneys, it is rather {{difficult}} to drink too much water, but (especially in warm humid weather and while exercising) it is dangerous to drink too little.

The popular claim that [...] "a person should consume eight <b>glasses</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> per day" [...] {{seems to have no}} real basis in science. Studies have shown that extra water intake, especially up to 500ml at mealtime was conducive to weight loss. Adequate fluid intake is helpful in preventing constipation.|$|E
