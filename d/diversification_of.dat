5|$|The Cretaceous period saw the {{appearance}} of more plant defense mechanisms. The <b>diversification</b> <b>of</b> flowering plants (angiosperms) at that time {{is associated with the}} sudden burst of speciation in insects. This <b>diversification</b> <b>of</b> insects represented a major selective force in plant evolution, and led to selection of plants that had defensive adaptations. Early insect herbivores were mandibulate and bit or chewed vegetation; but the evolution of vascular plants lead to the co-evolution of other forms of herbivory, such as sap-sucking, leaf mining, gall forming and nectar-feeding.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} whether {{and in what}} measure scientists tend to diversify their research activity, and if this tendency varies according to their belonging to different disciplinary areas. We analyze the nature <b>of</b> research <b>diversification</b> along three dimensions: extent <b>of</b> <b>diversification,</b> intensity <b>of</b> <b>diversification,</b> and degree <b>of</b> relatedness of topics in which researchers diversifies. For this purpose we propose three bibliometric indicators, based on the disciplinary placement of scientific output of individual scientists. The empirical investigation shows that the extent <b>of</b> <b>diversification</b> is lowest for scientists in Mathematics and highest in Chemistry; intensity <b>of</b> <b>diversification</b> is lowest in Earth sciences and highest in Industrial and information engineering; and degree of relatedness is lowest in Earth sciences and highest in Chemistry...|$|R

40|$|This study {{contributes}} to the research on the effect <b>of</b> <b>diversification</b> on performance under conditions of uncertainty. More specifically, we examine diversification {{in the context of}} venture capital firms. Drawing on the knowledge and organizational learning literature, we hypothesize that firms benefit from either low levels <b>of</b> <b>diversification</b> because <b>of</b> efficiencies in processing knowledge or high levels <b>of</b> <b>diversification</b> because <b>of</b> access to broad information that facilitates solving complex problems and the ability to direct a portfolio company down different trajectories. Consistent with our hypotheses, we find a U-shaped relationship. Firms benefit from either low or high levels of diversification; moderate levels yield the poorest results. When uncertainty is highest (i. e., early stage investing, no coinvestors), the effects are most pronounced...|$|R

5|$|During the Late Permian, {{increasing}} aridity and the <b>diversification</b> <b>of</b> reptiles contributed into {{a decline}} in terrestrial temnospondyls, but semiaquatic and fully aquatic temnospondyls continued to flourish, including the large Melosaurus of Eastern Europe. Other temnospondyls, such as archegosaurids, developed long snouts and a close similarity to crocodiles, although they lacked the armor characteristic of the latter group. These temnospondyls included the largest known batrachomorph, the 9-m-long Prionosuchus of Brazil.|$|E

5|$|Megalodon faced {{a highly}} {{competitive}} environment. However, its position {{at the top of}} the food chain probably had a profound impact on the structuring of marine communities. Fossil evidence indicates a correlation between megalodon and the emergence and <b>diversification</b> <b>of</b> cetaceans and other marine mammals. Juvenile megalodon preferred habitats where small cetaceans were abundant, and adult megalodon preferred habitats where large cetaceans were abundant. Such preferences may have developed shortly after they appeared in the Oligocene.|$|E
5|$|Sequence {{analysis}} {{suggests that the}} catalytic β subunits diverged earlier in evolution than the predominantly structural α subunits. In bacteria that express a 20S proteasome, the β subunits have high sequence identity to archaeal and eukaryotic β subunits, whereas the α sequence identity is much lower. The presence of 20S proteasomes in bacteria may result from lateral gene transfer, while the <b>diversification</b> <b>of</b> subunits among eukaryotes is ascribed to multiple gene duplication events.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} venom {{is thought to}} have {{provided}} the catalyst for the rapid <b>diversification</b> <b>of</b> snakes in the Cenozoic period, particularly to the Colubridae and their colonization of the Americas. Scholars suggest that the reason for this huge expansion was the shift from a mechanical to a biochemical method of subduing prey. Snake venoms attack biological pathways and processes that are also targeted by venoms of other taxa; for instance, calcium channel blockers have been found in snakes, spiders, and cone snails, thus suggesting that venom exhibits convergent evolution.|$|E

5|$|With {{the growing}} {{industrialization}} that accelerated during the 20th and 21st century, Italian society gradually moved from an agricultural base to an urban and industrial center. This change weakened traditional culture {{in many parts}} of society; a similar process occurred in other European countries, but unlike them, Italy had no major initiative to preserve traditional musics. Immigration from North Africa, Asia, and other European countries led to further <b>diversification</b> <b>of</b> Italian music. Traditional music came to exist only in small pockets, especially as part of dedicated campaigns to retain local musical identities.|$|E
40|$|The {{marginal}} benefits <b>of</b> <b>diversification</b> {{exceed the}} costs by a decreasing margin, and diversifying beyond the optimal level {{will produce a}} wealth loss. This trade-off predicts an inverted U-relation between the degree <b>of</b> <b>diversification</b> and wealth. We find empirical {{evidence in support of}} this trade-off proposition. Consistent with the trade-off, firms diversify cautiously and stop diversifying before the marginal benefits are offset by the costs. Our findings lend support to the arguments suggesting efficient diversification. In line with the endogeneity <b>of</b> <b>diversification,</b> the findings also indicate that the optimal level <b>of</b> <b>diversification</b> can vary across firms depending on their reasons for diversifying...|$|R
