500|$|The {{hidden track}} [...] "Honey" [...] is a percussive, lighthearted love song that {{contains}} a sample of singer Nancy Wilson's 1978 song [...] "I'm in Love". The track opens with a reprise of [...] "Amerykahn Promise", with an announcer saying, [...] "We hope you <b>enjoyed</b> <b>your</b> journey and now we’re putting control of you back to you", and a countdown leading to [...] "Honey". According to Badu, the song is about [...] "a lover, a fictitious character named Slim, who I'm chasing." [...] Allmusic's Andy Kellman commented that the song is included as an unlisted track as [...] "it doesn't fit into the album's fabric, what with its drifting, deeply sweetened, synth-squish-and-string-drift groove." ...|$|E

[...] Epstein replied with, [...] "We just popped in to say hello. I <b>enjoyed</b> <b>your</b> performance." [...] He introduced Taylor, who merely nodded a greeting, said, [...] "Well done, then, goodbye", and left.

Taylor replied that he honestly thought they were [...] "absolutely awful", but there was something [...] "remarkable" [...] about them. Epstein sat there smiling {{for a long time before}} exclaiming, [...] "I think they're tremendous!" [...] Later, when Epstein was paying the bill, he grabbed Taylor's arm and said, [...] "Do you think I should manage them?" ...|$|E
