500|$|For {{the timing}} of {{introducing}} the new characters, the showrunners decided to introduce the Punisher immediately and hold back on Elektra briefly, with Ramirez explaining that [...] "one of the pitfalls when we have this many great characters to play with is wanting to throw them at the wall", but {{it was important to}} take the time to introduce the new characters properly to the audience, particularly to the people who weren't already familiar with them. Elaborating on the aim to keep the story focused on Murdock, Petrie revealed that the writers would often come up with [...] "amazing stuff" [...] for the season, but then realize that they had forgotten about Murdock and had to [...] "completely turn it over and look at how this affects Matt and filter it through that prism." [...] Ramirez added,It could easily become The Punisher story or the Elektra story that Matt cameos in, and not vice versa. So, we built it like a Matt story, <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> wanted to put him through, where we wanted to get him, by the end of the season, and what we wanted to have him learn about himself, and we used an Elektra and Frank story throughout, to get him there... we talked about when we watch shows in 13 episode stretches, how do we watch them? What is an exciting structure that we would like to think about here? Do we divide it right down the middle? Do we do a three-act structure?...If you were to sit and watch 13 episodes, you would absolutely feel a structure, much like in the comics. That’s what we did this season.|$|E

Dara Cook from MTV called the song [...] "airy ditty" [...] and wrote [...] " [...] Mariah exudes as much sentiment as hollowed-out driftwood." [...] Cook continued onto the song's production, writing [...] "By texturing it into the song, producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis have finally found productive use (other than song closing spectacle) for Mariah's high octave shriek." [...] AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine named [...] "Heartbreaker" [...] {{as one of his}} top three choices from the album. Danyel Smith from Entertainment Weekly called the song a [...] "delectable confection" [...] and wrote [...] "she smartly uses Jay-Z's droll rap about a bratty girlfriend as tart counterpoint to her creamy tones," [...] however calling it a recycled version of Carey's previous songs [...] "Dreamlover" [...] (1993) and [...] "Fantasy" [...] (1995). Elysa Gardner from the Los Angeles Times called the song [...] "breezy" [...] and noted how Carey [...] "brings a similarly light, sensuous touch" [...] to [...] "Heartbreaker". Additionally, Gardner complimented Jay-Z's rap verses, calling them [...] "sly." [...] Editor from Rolling Stone Arion Berger, called it [...] "nasal, silken and declarative" [...] while [...] "riding the percolating beat." [...] Additionally, Berger also compared it to Carey's [...] "Fantasy", for its similar usage of a sampled hook. Tom Sinclair from Entertainment Weekly reviewed the song individually, giving it an F. He called it a [...] "rehash" [...] of [...] "Fantasy" [...] and wrote [...] "What self-respecting artist would have the gall to recycle the Tom Tom Club's 'Genius of Love' (the source of 'Fantasy') for a second time in four years? It's a given that pop will eat itself, but this sort of self-cannibalization should be illegal." [...] Chuck Taylor from Billboard gave the song a mixed review, writing [...] "Yes it's a hit, and her voice is in fine form, but 'Heartbreaker' is a disappointment <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> know [...] she's capable of writing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Taste can be {{objective}} {{in terms of}} the five tastes (sweet, salt, sour, bitter, and savory) {{but it can also be}} subjective <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> deem [...] "good" [...] and [...] "bad." [...] Taste is [...] "subjective, objective, and qualitative". In terms of it being a philosophical concept, taste is hard to define because it is essentially subjective when pertaining to the personal preferences of individuals i.e. [...] "'de gustibus non est disputandum' (there is no disputing taste)". We cannot tell someone they do not think something tastes good because we do not agree, and vice versa. In order to evaluate taste in this context, we must explore all the ways in which taste can be defined. According to Alan Weiss, taste fulfills the purpose of six functions: taste is the tool in which we use to define flavor; it is also flavor and how we categorize flavor (sweet or salty); it is the preference, we as the tastemakers, place on specific flavors and our demand for those flavors; it is whether we choose to like or dislike a certain taste and therefore allow it into our general society of acceptable tastes or exile it; it is the value in which we place on certain taste (one might believe one's taste in Bach or Rothko earns one capital); and lastly, with good judgement comes good taste and therefore, one with expressively good taste are expected to have good judgement, just as those in bad taste are expected to be in bad judgement ...|$|E

5000|$|It is {{important}} for the actor to understand [...] "not too quickly". He must reflect and interrogate himself about the possibilities; he should surprise himself.

50|$|De Moivre {{pioneered the}} {{development}} of analytic geometry and the theory of probability by expanding upon {{the work of his}} predecessors, particularly Christiaan Huygens and several members of the Bernoulli family. He also produced the second textbook on probability theory, The Doctrine of Chances: a method of calculating the probabilities of events in play. (The first book about games of chance, Liber de ludo aleae (On Casting the Die), was written by Girolamo Cardano in the 1560s, but it was not published until 1663.) This book came out in four editions, 1711 in Latin, and in English in 1718, 1738, and 1756. In the later editions of his book, de Moivre included his unpublished result of 1733, which is the first statement of an approximation to the binomial distribution <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> now call the normal or Gaussian function. This was the first method of finding the probability of the occurrence of an error of a given size when that error is expressed in terms of the variability of the distribution as a unit, and the first identification of the calculation of probable error. In addition, he applied these theories to gambling problems and actuarial tables.|$|E
