5|$|After World War II, the Philippines {{was for a}} time {{regarded}} as the second wealthiest in East Asia, next only to Japan. In the 1960s its <b>economic</b> performance started being overtaken. The economy stagnated under the dictatorship of President Ferdinand Marcos as the regime spawned <b>economic</b> mismanagement and political volatility. The country suffered from slow <b>economic</b> growth and bouts of <b>economic</b> recession. Only in the 1990s with a program of <b>economic</b> liberalization did the economy begin to recover.|$|E
5|$|Beginning with William Stanley Jevons and Clément Juglar in the 1860s, economists {{attempted}} {{to explain the}} cycles of frequent, violent shifts in <b>economic</b> activity. A key milestone in this endeavor was {{the foundation of the}} U.S. National Bureau of <b>Economic</b> Research by Wesley Mitchell in 1920. This marked the beginning of a boom in atheoretical, statistical models of <b>economic</b> fluctuation (models based on cycles and trends instead of <b>economic</b> theory) that led to the discovery of apparently regular <b>economic</b> patterns like the Kuznets wave.|$|E
5|$|Critics of {{the policy}} of <b>economic</b> {{liberalization}} pursued during the Menem Presidency argued that Argentina's <b>economic</b> woes were caused by neoliberalism, which had been actively promoted by the U.S. government and the IMF under the Washington Consensus. Others have stressed that the main shortcoming of <b>economic</b> policy-making during the 1990s was that <b>economic</b> reform was not pursued with enough determination. A 2004 report by the IMF's Independent Evaluation Office criticised the IMF's conduct prior to Argentina's <b>economic</b> collapse of 2001, saying the IMF had supported the country's fixed exchange rate for too long, and was too lenient towards fiscal deficits.|$|E
5|$|Humans employ {{nature for}} both leisure and <b>economic</b> activities. The {{acquisition}} {{of natural resources}} for industrial use remains a sizable component of the world's <b>economic</b> system.Some activities, such as hunting and fishing, are used for both sustenance and leisure, often by different people. Agriculture was first adopted around the 9th millennium BCE. Ranging from food production to energy, nature influences <b>economic</b> wealth.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the then-Prime Minister of Russia, Vladimir Putin, {{announced}} {{his support for}} Nursultan Nazarbayev's idea {{for the creation of}} a Eurasian <b>Economic</b> Union. On 18 November 2011, the presidents of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia signed an agreement setting a target of establishing the Eurasian <b>Economic</b> Union by 2015. The member states put together a joint commission on fostering closer <b>economic</b> ties.|$|E
5|$|In September 1975, Gravel {{was named}} {{as one of}} several Congressional Advisers to the Seventh Special Session of the United Nations, which met to discuss {{problems}} related to <b>economic</b> development and international <b>economic</b> cooperation.|$|E
5|$|Michael Walker of the Fraser Institute and Friedman {{hosted a}} series of {{conferences}} from 1986 to 1994. The goal {{was to create a}} clear definition of <b>economic</b> freedom and a method for measuring it. Eventually this resulted in the first report on worldwide <b>economic</b> freedom, <b>Economic</b> Freedom in the World. This annual report has since provided data for numerous peer-reviewed studies and has influenced policy in several nations.|$|E
5|$|On January 1, 2012, {{the three}} states {{established}} the Eurasian <b>Economic</b> Space which ensures the effective functioning {{of a single}} market for goods, services, capital and labour, and to establish coherent industrial, transport, energy and agricultural policies. The agreement included a roadmap for future integration and established the Eurasian <b>Economic</b> Commission (modelled on the European Commission). The Eurasian <b>Economic</b> Commission serves as the regulatory agency for the Eurasian Customs Union, the Single <b>Economic</b> Space and the Eurasian <b>Economic</b> Union.|$|E
5|$|Recovery {{began with}} the mid-1948 {{currency}} reform in Western Germany, and was sped up by the liberalisation of European <b>economic</b> policy that the Marshall Plan (1948–1951) both directly and indirectly caused. The post-1948 West German recovery {{has been called the}} German <b>economic</b> miracle. Italy also experienced an <b>economic</b> boom and the French economy rebounded. By contrast, the United Kingdom {{was in a state of}} <b>economic</b> ruin, and although it received a quarter of the total Marshall Plan assistance, more than any other European country, continued relative <b>economic</b> decline for decades.|$|E
5|$|Russia's <b>economic</b> {{development}} minister {{stated that}} the Turkish <b>economic</b> minister, Nihat Zeybekci, put forward an initiative for closer cooperation with the Eurasian <b>Economic</b> Union, including {{the formation of a}} free trade zone between the union and Turkey.|$|E
5|$|Several {{key areas}} have been {{targeted}} for <b>economic</b> analysis and reform: the environmental effects of unconstrained <b>economic</b> growth; the consequences of nature being treated as an <b>economic</b> externality; {{and the possibility of}} an economics that takes greater account of the social and environmental consequences of market behavior.|$|E
5|$|The BJP's <b>economic</b> {{policy has}} changed {{considerably}} since its founding. There {{is a significant}} range of <b>economic</b> ideologies within the party. In the 1980s, like the Jana Sangh, it reflected the thinking of the RSS and its affiliates. It supported swadeshi (the promotion of indigenous industries and products) and a protectionist export policy. However, it supported internal <b>economic</b> liberalisation, and opposed the state-driven industrialisation favoured by the Congress.|$|E
5|$|The Court of the Eurasian <b>Economic</b> Union {{replaced}} the Court of the Eurasian <b>Economic</b> Community (EurAsEC Court) in 2015. It {{is in charge}} of dispute resolution and the interpretation of the legal order within the Eurasian <b>Economic</b> Union. Its headquarters is in Minsk. The court is composed of two judges from each member state, appointed by the heads of government of the member states. Their term of office is nine years.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian <b>Economic</b> Union {{has sought}} to base its model on the European Union. All {{institutions}} carry out their work {{in compliance with the}} Treaty on the Eurasian <b>Economic</b> Commission (EEC) and the international agreements that provide the legal and regulatory framework of the Customs Union and the Single <b>Economic</b> Space.|$|E
5|$|The Kingdom of Mysore {{reached a}} peak in <b>economic</b> power under Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan, in the post-Mughal {{era of the}} mid-late 18th century. They {{embarked}} on an ambitious program of <b>economic</b> development, aiming to increase the wealth and revenue of Mysore. Under their reign, Mysore overtook the Bengal Subah as India's dominant <b>economic</b> power, with productive agriculture and textile manufacturing.|$|E
5|$|The University System of Ohio is the nation's largest {{comprehensive}} public {{system of}} higher education. Member universities include the University of Cincinnati, {{which has a}} $3+ billion annual <b>economic</b> impact and is the largest employer in Cincinnati, Kent State University, which contributes a $1.9 billion <b>economic</b> impact in Northeast Ohio, and the University of Toledo, which contributes a $1.1 billion <b>economic</b> impact in Northwest Ohio.|$|E
5|$|The West Triangle <b>Economic</b> Zone is an <b>economic</b> zone {{designated}} by the Chinese government comprising Chengdu, Chongqing and Xi'an. Created as part of China's Western Development strategy, the West Triangle <b>Economic</b> Zone contributes nearly 40% of Western China's GDP. Furthermore, Chongqing is one of China's five National Central Cities, while both Chengdu and Xi'an are Regional Central Cities.|$|E
5|$|The {{collective}} leadership {{first set}} out to stabilize the Soviet Union and calm Soviet society, a task which {{they were able to}} accomplish. In addition, they attempted to speed up <b>economic</b> growth, which had slowed considerably during Khrushchev's last years as ruler. In 1965, Kosygin initiated several reforms to decentralize the Soviet economy. After initial success in creating <b>economic</b> growth, hard-liners within the Party halted the reforms, fearing that they would weaken the Party's prestige and power. No other radical <b>economic</b> reforms were carried out during the Brezhnev era, and <b>economic</b> growth began to stagnate in the early-to-mid-1970s. By Brezhnev's death in 1982, Soviet <b>economic</b> growth had, according to several historians, nearly come to a standstill.|$|E
5|$|The <b>economic</b> {{growth has}} been driven by the {{expansion}} of services that have been growing consistently faster than other sectors. It is argued that the pattern of Indian development has been a specific one and that the country may be able to skip the intermediate industrialisation-led phase in the transformation of its <b>economic</b> structure. Serious concerns have been raised about the jobless nature of the <b>economic</b> growth.|$|E
5|$|When {{discussing}} the Eurasian <b>Economic</b> Union, Vladimir Putin said the Eurasian <b>Economic</b> Union would include closer coordination of <b>economic</b> and monetary policy, {{including the use}} of a common currency in the future. Although the creation of a monetary union was not envisaged in the Eurasian <b>Economic</b> Union Treaty, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev called for the introduction of a common currency for the Eurasian <b>Economic</b> Union. Leonid Slutsky, head of the State Duma's CIS committee, backed Medvedev's proposal to start discussions on the creation of a monetary union. Slutsky said it could be introduced shortly after 2015, when the union's structure becomes clear.|$|E
5|$|With {{strong support}} from Ryzhkov, Gorbachev {{abolished}} the Central Committee <b>economic</b> department, thereby strengthening the authority of central government over <b>economic</b> matters. From then on, the government could not be blamed for <b>economic</b> policies initiated by the Party leadership. The establishment of the post of President of the Soviet Union by Gorbachev in 1990 weakened {{the power of the}} government apparatus; a move Ryzhkov and his second cabinet opposed.|$|E

25|$|A multitiered {{network of}} transregional <b>economic</b> {{cooperation}} associations also was established. The Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986–90) divided China into three regions — eastern, central, and western, {{each with its}} own <b>economic</b> development plans. In addition to the three major regions, three echelons of <b>economic</b> cooperation zones were created. The first echelon — national-level <b>economic</b> development zones — cut across several provincial-level boundaries and linked major <b>economic</b> areas. Among these were the Shanghai <b>Economic</b> Zone, the Northeastern <b>Economic</b> Zone, the energy production bases centering on Shanxi Province, the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan <b>Economic</b> Zone, and the Southwestern <b>Economic</b> Zone. The second-echelon network linked provincial-level capitals with designated ports and cities along vital communication lines and included the Huaihai <b>Economic</b> Zone (consisting of fifteen coastal prefectures and cities in Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, and Shandong provinces) and the Pearl River Delta <b>Economic</b> Zone centered on the southern city of Guangzhou. The third tier of zones centered on provincial-level capitals and included the Nanjing Regional <b>Economic</b> Cooperation Association. Smaller-scale lateral <b>economic</b> ties below the provincial level, among prefectures, counties, and cities, also were formed.|$|E
25|$|These include: (a) <b>economic</b> policy, disseminated by {{government}} agencies and central banks, (b) <b>economic</b> conditions, generally revealed through <b>economic</b> reports, and other <b>economic</b> indicators.|$|E
25|$|China, {{having been}} through {{a long period of}} <b>economic</b> {{downturn}} before 1978, has recently become one of the world's major <b>economic</b> powers, following the implementation of <b>economic</b> reform from 1979. China shows a great development potential from its remarkable <b>economic</b> growth rate in these years.|$|E
