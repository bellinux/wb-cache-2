A concept of the edge Burgers vector is introduced to describe such dislocations by analogy with the Burgers vector of standard bulk dislocations. Analytical solutions for the structure and energy of <b>edge</b> <b>stacking</b> dislocations in bilayer graphene are obtained depending on the magnitude of elongation and angles between the edge Burgers vector, direction of elongation and edge. The barrier for penetration of stacking dislocations inside the bilayer is estimated.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is to present a new {{approach}} for recovering 3 D shape of an object. We exploited the idea of image reconstruction from projection to construct the cross-section image of the object. Each of the cross-section images is computed from a series of photographs taken at a number of angles around the object. A corresponding intensity profile (row) on each digitized photograph resembles a projection data, which can be used to reconstruct a cross-section image of the object. To extract a 2 D coordinate of sectional contour of the object, edge detection is performed followed by locating the x-y position of the pixel constituting the detected <b>edge.</b> <b>Stacking</b> of 2 D contours yields a 3 D coordinate of the object. To provide better 3 D visualization, we also performed a surface-rendering technique on the volumetric data constructed from a stack of cross-section image. Unlike conventional 3 D-shape recovery method which uses stereo pairs of camera, our technique does not suffer from a laborious corresponding problem. The 3 D – acquisition system is simple, as it requires only a digital camera and a rotating platform. Our purposed method is tested to perform 3 D-shape recovery of a variety of objects. The result is very promising. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{replacement}} of asbestos fibres with cellulose fibres in producing corrugated fibre reinforced cement sheets by the Hatschek process resulted in <b>edge</b> cracking for <b>stacked</b> sheets. This {{was due to}} the hydrophilic nature of cellulose, which increases its tendency for exchanging water with the surroundings. The drying process of corrugated sheets, in a stack, resulted in shrinkage hence edge cracking along the sheet. To reduce the magnitude of drying shrinkage and edge cracking potential, several mitigation strategies were proposed including the surface treatment of cellulose fibres, incorporation of wollastonite microfibres, addition of admixtures and superplasticizers, kaolin inclusion as partial {{replacement of}} cement and different exposure conditions. A fundamental understanding in mechanisms behind volume changes and how cracks form was crucial for optimization of the mitigation strategies. This thesis initially used a review approach to understand the mechanisms involved in different types of shrinkage and the role of different mitigation techniques. The ultimate goal was to achieve lower drying shrinkage and cracking risks in corrugated sheets along with reducing its economic impact. As a result, surface treatment of cellulose fibres, based on transforming the hydrophilic nature of cellulose to hydrophobic state, was investigated. Furthermore, inclusion of wollastonite/ kaolin as partial replacement of cement, were evaluated. Also, the potential of adding admixtures/ superplasticizers was explored. Finally, investigation on development of <b>edge</b> cracks in <b>stacked</b> corrugated fibrecement sheets was conducted under different exposure conditions. The results and findings of this research showed no significant improvement in permeability with cellulose surface treatment. Wollastonite microfibres promoted pore discontinuity hence significant reduction in permeability thus lower drying shrinkage. However, the resultant sheets were brittle. By reducing water content with addition of superplasticizers, density was enhanced thus reducing volume change from drying and wetting. Kaolin acted as internal restraint for shrinkage, refining the microstructure at the interfacial transition zone thus increasing density and its pozzolanic reaction enhanced mechanical properties.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{summarizes}} {{our recent}} {{work on the}} development of thermal anemometry to measure velocity and temperature fluctuations in oscillating flows. First, we demonstrate that velocity cannot be measured accurately by hot-wire anemometry in oscillating flows when the flow reverses its direction. Indeed, there is no unique and well-defined correlation between the flow velocity and heat transfer near flow reversal, which prevents the recovery of velocity fluctuations from the anemometer signal. Second, we detail new procedures for the measurement of temperature fluctuations in oscillating flows using cold-wire thermometry. Thermal inertia alters the response of the sensor to temperature changes. The thermal inertia of the cold-wire (operated by a constant-current or a constant-voltage anemometer) is corrected instantaneously using the same wire but in the heated mode (operated by a constant-voltage anemometer). The new procedures are validated in an acoustic standing-wave where temperature fluctuations amplitudes lower than 0. 2 K at approximately 1000 Hz are successfully measured.
