Good <b>friends</b> <b>do</b> not necessarily make good chavrusas. If the chavrusas spend too much time chatting or joking with each other at the expense of their study time, they are advised to find different study partners.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Ajay Singh Rathod (R. Madhavan), {{a flight}} {{lieutenant}} in the Indian Air Force who is Sonia's fiancé, is killed when his jet, a MiG-21, crashes. The government proclaims that the crash was caused by pilot error and closes the investigation. Knowing that Rathod was an ace pilot, Sonia and her <b>friends</b> <b>do</b> not accept the official explanation. Instead, they claim that he sacrificed his life to save hundreds of other lives {{that would have been}} lost had he ejected from the aircraft and left it to crash into a populous city. They investigate and learn that the crash was due to a corrupt defence minister Shastri (Mohan Agashe), who had signed a contract exchanging cheap and illegal MiG-21 aircraft spare parts for a personal favour. To their surprise, they learn that the key person who was responsible for organizing the deal was Karan's father, Rajnath Singhania (Anupam Kher).|$|E
25|$|Some Conservative <b>Friends</b> <b>do</b> not self-describe {{this witness}} as {{being part of}} their {{simplicity}} testimony, but rather their integrity testimony, viewing it as an obedience to God's will rather than a witness to a human-generated ideal. Thomas Hamm, in his book Quakers in America, describes a transition among most Friends from plainness to simplicity.|$|E

The idea came together after he saw a Game Boy {{and the ability to}} communicate between Game Boys, and Tajiri decided Pokémon made the most sense on the handheld console. Tajiri pioneered the idea of connectivity between handheld game consoles, by suggesting that Game Boys could use their link cables in order to have <b>friends</b> <b>do</b> more than simply play against each other.|$|E
25|$|In {{common with}} other Christian {{denominations}} {{derived from the}} 16th century Puritanism, many <b>Friends</b> <b>do</b> not observe religious festivals (e.g. Christmas, Lent, or Easter), but instead believe that Christ's birth, crucifixion, and resurrection, should be commemorated {{every day of the}} year. For example, many Quakers feel that fasting at Lent, but then eating in excess at other times of the year is hypocrisy and therefore many Quakers, rather than observing Lent, live a simple lifestyle all the year round (see Testimony of Simplicity). These practices are {{often referred to as the}} testimony against times and seasons.|$|E
25|$|Job laments {{the day of}} his birth; {{he would}} like to die, but even that is denied to him. His three friends Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite, console him. The <b>friends</b> <b>do</b> not waver in their belief that Job's {{suffering}} is a punishment for sin, for God causes no one to suffer innocently, and they advise him to repent and seek God's mercy. Job responds with scorn: a just God would not treat him so harshly, patience in suffering is impossible, and the Creator should not take his creatures so lightly, to come against them with such force.|$|E

25|$|Within some Friends Churches in the Evangelical Friends Church, in {{particular}} in Rwanda, Burundi, {{and parts of the}} U.S., an adult believer's baptism by immersion in water, is optional. Within Liberal Friends, Conservative Friends, and Pastoral Friends Churches, <b>Friends</b> <b>do</b> not practise water baptism, Christening, or other initiation ceremonies to admit a new member or a newborn baby. Children are often welcomed into the meeting at their first attendance. Formerly, children born to Quaker parents automatically became members (sometimes called Birthright membership), but this is no longer the case in many areas. Some parents apply for membership on behalf of their children, while others allow the child to decide whether to become a member when they are ready, and older in age. Some meetings adopt a policy that children, some time after becoming young adults, must apply independently for membership.|$|E
25|$|Nick recuperates in a {{military}} hospital in Saigon with no knowledge of his friends. After being released, he goes AWOL and aimlessly stumbles through the red-light district at night. He encounters Julien Grinda, a Frenchman, outside a gambling den where men play Russian roulette for money. Grinda entices the reluctant Nick to participate and leads him into the den. Mike {{is present in the}} den, watching the game, but the two <b>friends</b> <b>do</b> not notice each other at first. When Mike does see Nick, he is unable to get his attention. When Nick is introduced into the game, he grabs the gun, fires it at the current contestant, and then again at his own temple, causing the audience to riot in protest. Grinda hustles Nick outside to his car to escape the angry mob. Mike cannot catch up with them as they speed away.|$|E
500|$|Although he {{was trying}} new things musically, Ochs did not abandon his protest roots. He was profoundly {{concerned}} with the escalation of the Vietnam War, performing tirelessly at anti-war rallies across the country. In 1967 he organized two rallies to declare that [...] "The War Is Over"—"Is everybody sick of this stinking war? In that case, <b>friends,</b> <b>do</b> what I {{and thousands of other}} Americans have done—declare the war over."—one in Los Angeles in June, the other in New York in November. He continued to write and record anti-war songs, such as [...] "The War Is Over" [...] and [...] "White Boots Marching in a Yellow Land". Other topical songs of this period include [...] "Outside of a Small Circle of Friends", inspired by the murder of Kitty Genovese, who was stabbed to death outside of her New York City apartment building while dozens of her neighbors reportedly ignored her cries for help, and [...] "William Butler Yeats Visits Lincoln Park and Escapes Unscathed", about the despair he felt {{in the aftermath of the}} Chicago 1968 Democratic National Convention police riot.|$|E

500|$|In Willow's dream {{she struggles}} {{to find her}} place in the school theater {{production}} of Death of a Salesman, while her friends and classmates are apparently fully costumed, prepared, and ready to go on stage. Her confusion represents her lack of self-confidence, her fear that she still does not fit in or have a place in the world, unlike those around her, who are competent and know what is going on. She wears ordinary clothes, but the others repeatedly comment on the excellence of her [...] "costume", a reference to her fear that her <b>friends</b> <b>do</b> not see what she has grown into, but rather what she was when younger: nerdy and awkward. This fear is confirmed when Buffy strips off her shirt and jeans, revealing the same unfashionable turtleneck and corduroy jumper she wore in episode one of the series, four years earlier, before her demon-fighting experiences and study of magic increased her confidence and competence. Willow stands anxiously {{at the front of the}} class, trying to read a paper, while her classmates express their boredom with listening to her and Oz whispers into Tara's ear, until she is attacked by the First Slayer and her breath is sucked out of her body.|$|E
500|$|As of July 1989 about $500 {{million in}} {{donations}} had been {{delivered to the}} Armenians from 113 countries. Most of those funds went into the initial relief work and medical care plus the beginning portion of the rebuilding phase. Yuri S. Mkhitarian, an Armenian State Building Committee official, gave an updated damage report that included some of the outlying communities away from the population centers stating that 342 villages were damaged and another 58 were destroyed. The negative effect the earthquake had on the economy of Armenia was apparent. Mkhitarian said that 130 factories were destroyed and 170,000 people were out of work. Officials acknowledged that the work to complete the rebuilding may take {{up to five years}} or longer, a supposition that more than doubled Gorbachev's estimate of two years. At that time 20 projects had completed the planning process and some had been approved and construction started. In Leninakan there was a need for 18 new hospitals, 12 of which could be funded {{with the assistance of the}} republics of the Soviet Union, but foreign help would be required to build six additional facilities. Boris Karapetyan, director of earthquake studies at the Yerevan Polytechnical Institute, said of the difficult rebuilding process [...] "Coordination is a major, major problem. This is a massive undertaking, and foreign involvement is both a necessary and a complicating factor. We need foreign assistance—and there is no doubt about that—but our <b>friends</b> <b>do</b> not know the local conditions and propose things that cannot or should not be built in an earthquake-prone region." ...|$|E

2500|$|Burr {{certainly}} knew of Hamilton's publicly opposing his ascension to the vice-presidency in 1800. Hamilton made confidential statements against him, such {{as those}} enumerated in Hamilton's private letter to Supreme Court Justice Rutledge. In the attachment to that letter, Hamilton had argued against Burr's character on repetitive scores, for example [...] "suspected on strong grounds of having corruptly served {{the views of the}} Holland Company ... his very <b>friends</b> <b>do</b> not insist on his integrity ... he will court and employ able and daring scoundrels ... his conduct indicates [...] Supreme power in his own person ... will in all likelihood attempt a usurpation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Most {{words in}} Fuzhou dialect have {{cognates}} in other varieties of Chinese, so a non-Fuzhou speaker {{would find it}} much easier to understand Fuzhou dialect written in Chinese characters than spoken in conversation.

[...] This was considered an aspect of simplicity because it was simply telling the truth rather than embellishing it with an oath, which is not necessary if one is supposed to always tell the truth.

And in a way we still are," [...] said one classmate in 1996. Jerry Atkins stated [...] "What happened was so tragic and for many of us who lived through it, the frustration and sadness will always be there." [...] Mrs. Brown said, [...] "I trust the men who are handling the investigation into my daughter's death. I'm sure they'll find who ever did it. If he is caught, I would like to kill him.

2500|$|Conservative Friends (also {{known as}} [...] "Wilburites" [...] after their founder, John Wilbur), {{share some of}} the beliefs of George Fox and the Early Friends. Many Wilburites see {{themselves}} as the Quakers whose beliefs are most true to original Quaker doctrine, arguing that the majority of Friends [...] "broke away" [...] from the Wilburite Quakers in the 19th and 20th centuries (rather than the Wilburites being the [...] "breakaway" [...] sect). Conservative Friends place their trust in the immediate guidance of God. Conservative Friends completely reject all forms of religious symbolism and outward sacraments, such as the Eucharist and water baptism. Conservative <b>Friends</b> <b>do</b> not believe in relying upon the practice of outward rites and sacraments, to have a living relationship with God through Christ; believing that holiness can exist in all of the activities of one's daily life—and that all of life is sacred in God. Many Conservative Friends believe that a meal held with others can become a form of communion with God, and with one another.|$|E
