50|$|As {{the name}} implies, the <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> {{appears as a}} flat sheet of liquid. The pattern is formed by an {{elliptical}} or a round orifice on a deflective surface that is tangent to the exit orifice. The orifice has an external groove with a contoured internal cylindrical radius, or “cat’s eye” shape. In the elliptical orifice design, the <b>pattern</b> <b>sprays</b> out of the orifice {{in line with the}} pipe. In the deflector design, the <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> is perpendicular to the pipe. There are two categories of <b>flat</b> <b>spray,</b> tapered and even, depending on the uniformity of the spray over the <b>spray</b> <b>pattern.</b> <b>Flat</b> <b>spray</b> <b>patterns</b> with tapering edges are produced by straight-through elliptical spray nozzles. This <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> is useful for overlapping patterns between multiple nozzle headers. The result is uniform distribution across the entire <b>sprayed</b> surface. Non-tapered <b>flat</b> <b>spray</b> nozzles are used in cleaning applications that require a uniform <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> without any overlap in spray area.|$|R

40|$|According to EU Directive 2009 / 128 /EC {{pesticide}} application equipment must function reliably and be {{used properly}} for its intended purpose ensuring that pesticides can be accurately dosed and distributed. The transverse distribution of the spray mixture in the target area must be even, where relevant. Spray jets of double <b>flat</b> <b>spray</b> nozzles are angled forward and backward. Depending {{on the design of}} the sprayer and boom height, parts of the equipment get splashed by the angled spray jet. Problems arise with lift masts which are fitted very close to the frame of the sprayer. Solutions might be technical modifications of the boom and tube. If technical changes are not possible, the use of <b>flat</b> <b>spray</b> nozzles on the boom is recommended in the critical area in combination with double <b>flat</b> <b>spray</b> nozzles. Results from sprayer inspection are shown with regard to cross distribution. Oftentimes, the deepness of the scanner patternator is not suitable in order to catch both spray jets of double <b>flat</b> <b>spray</b> nozzles. An upgrade for Herbst scanner patternator SPRAYERTEST 1000 is available. A modified table HV 1000 -L with 2 m in depth, which is double of the current one, is introduced to deal with that specific problem.

50|$|Dynamic {{viscosity}} {{is defined}} as the property of a liquid that resists change in the shape or arrangement of its elements during flow. Liquid viscosity primarily affects <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> formation and drop size.

50|$|Nozzle wear is {{indicated}} {{by an increase in}} nozzle capacity and by a change in the <b>spray</b> <b>pattern,</b> in which the distribution (uniformity of <b>spray</b> <b>pattern)</b> deteriorates and increases drop size. Choice of a wear-resistant material of construction increases nozzle life. Because many single fluid nozzles are used to meter flows, worn nozzles result in excessive liquid usage.|$|R
40|$|The size of subcooled liquified {{nitrogen}} droplets {{are measured}} with a 5 mW He-Ne laser {{as a function of}} pressure difference (delta P) across <b>flat</b> <b>spray</b> and full cone pressure atomizing nozzles. For delta P's of 3 to 30 psid, the spray sauter mean diameter (SMD) ranged between 250 to 50 microns. The pressure range tested is representative of those expected during cryogenic fluid transfer operations in space. The droplet sizes from the <b>flat</b> <b>spray</b> nozzles were greater than those from the full cone nozzle. A power function of the form, SMD varies as delta P(exp a), describes the spray SMD {{as a function of the}} delta P very well. The values of a were - 0. 36 for the <b>flat</b> <b>spray</b> and - 0. 87 for the full cone. The reduced dependence of the <b>flat</b> <b>spray</b> SMD on the delta P was probably because of: (1) the absence of a swirler that generates a turbulence within the nozzle to enhance atomization, and (2) a possible increase in shearing stress resulting from the delayed atomization due to the absence of turbulence. The nitrogen quality, up to 1. 5 percent is based on isenthalpic expansion, did not have a distinct and measurable effect on the spray SMD. Both bimodal and monomodal droplet size population distributions were measured. In the bimodal distribution, the frequency of the first mode was much greater than the frequency of the second mode. Also, the frequency of the second mode was low enough such that a monomodal approximation probably would give reasonable results...|$|R

40|$|There are {{a number}} of reasons for {{incorrect}} spray distributions but horizontal boom vibrations, effected by soil unevenness, are a major cause of irregular <b>spray</b> <b>patterns.</b> A modal model of a flexible sprayer boom was developed, based on experimental measurements and modal analysis techniques to investigate horizontal boom vibrations and the related <b>spray</b> <b>pattern.</b> Field input forces were simulated with a tractor and mounted sprayer driven over a standardized bumpy road.

The nozzles used may not be listed fire sprinklers, and are usually selected for a specific <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> to conform to the three-dimensional nature of the hazard (e.g. typical <b>spray</b> <b>patterns</b> being oval, fan, full circle, narrow jet). Examples of hazards protected by water spray systems are electrical transformers containing oil for cooling or turbo-generator bearings. Water spray systems can also be used externally on the surfaces of tanks containing flammable liquids or gases (such as hydrogen).

50|$|Impact of a spray {{onto the}} target surface is {{expressed}} as the force/area, N/m2 or lb/in2. This value {{depends on the}} <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> distribution and the spray angle.

40|$|The {{effects of}} nozzle wear on the flow rate and <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> of fan nozzles made of {{different}} materials and of different nominal capacities were investigated.

The percentage increase in flow rate for all tips varied approximately with the square root of the operation time. Wear measurements for new and worn orifices showed that wear mainly increased the minor axis length of the elliptical orifice.

40|$|Pesticide {{application}} {{is an integral}} part of crop production and ground-based agricultural boom sprayers are used extensively to apply pesticides to the crop canopy or soil surface across millions of acres in the United States. Efficient {{application is}} necessary to minimize costs and limit adverse environmental impacts. Errors in flow rate and system pressure measurements may cause as-applied maps to incorrectly indicate application rates and could negatively affect downstream data processing or analysis. The goals of this study were to provide quantified measurements on the effects of nozzle setup errors on <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> uniformity and evaluate how laboratory patternator data would compare to measurements on a full spray boom. More specific objectives were to: 1) determine the effects from factors such as nozzle lateral angle, nozzle spacing, nozzle replacement and nozzle pitch angle on <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> distribution, 2) evaluate a simulation approach to predict the effects of single nozzle boom setup errors on full boom system pattern uniformity, and 3) assess full boom operational measurements (e. g., flow, pressure, and <b>spray</b> <b>pattern)</b> to assess sensitivity for predicting boom distribution errors. Laboratory and field-based tests were devised to quantify the impact of nozzle setup and operational errors on <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> uniformity, boom pressure, and nozzle flow rates. Results indicated that small variations in boom setup or nozzle operation (i. e., pressure or flow) can cause significant errors in spray nozzle distribution which may not be completely detectable by measuring <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> alone. Simulations using laboratory data from setup or operational errors reflected similar changes in <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> CV as full boom data with similar setup errors. These findings were significant in that it may be possible to model full boom spray distributions based on smaller laboratory-collected datasets. Finally, full boom system-based pressure and flow measurements were compared with similar values at the boom subsection level. Results indicated that localized issues with nozzles or boom subsections may not be readily detected with system-based measurements. Those relying on system-based readings (e. g., pressure or flow) should expect errors exceeding 10 % compared to localized measurements across the spray boom. Advisor: Joe D. Luc...|$|R
