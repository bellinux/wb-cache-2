(And no, they didn 2 ̆ 7 t think the earth was flat [...] .). But in 1507 a peculiar item appeared–the Waldseemüller map– that outlined a fourth part of the world called 2 ̆ 2 America, 2 ̆ 2 with the Atlantic Ocean on the one side and an unnamed ocean on the other.

40|$|Plato and Aristotle {{justified}} {{their political}} theories by defining justice as to allocate to each his or hers own {{in accordance with}} that person s nature. It is just, then, Plato argues, to set {{a person who is}} by nature fitted to be a cobbler to cobble, a guardian to guard and so on. One s nature determines one s place in a just society. Interestingly, Aristotle argues that the virtues are different for men and women while Plato argues that the virtues of men and women are the same. By insisting that courage, as virtue, for a man is commanding while it is obeying for a woman, Aristotle justifies his claim that men ought to rule while women ought to be ruled. If we project Aristotle s argument on Plato, we get the interesting result that sex does not serve as a measure of who gets to rule whom since the virtues of men and women are the same. In the essay The Legal Status and Political Role of Women in Plato s Laws. David Cohen indicates that scholars have Shrugged off Plato s legislation in regard to women because <b>it</b> simply <b>didn</b> t seem particularly important what Plato thought about women and politics one way or the other. If Cohen s assessment is correct, scholars neglect of Plato s women is simultaneously a neglect of part of Plato s political justice. Plato s notion of justice in reference to the male nature is but half the story. The story will not be complete until the female nature is, as thoroughly as the male nature, connected with Plato s notion of justice. The Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy states that feminism is grounded on the belief that women are oppressed or disadvantaged by comparison with men, and that their oppression is in some way illegitimate or unjustified. In this essay we will use the general characterisation of feminism as an approach to examine whether the tasks in the public and the private sphere allocated to women by Plato are warranted by his notion of justice. That is, does Plato oppress women by assigning them tasks and functions, which, in reference to his views on female nature, are illegitimate? For a discriminatory treatment of individuals can only be justified by the notion of justice if a relevant difference is found. If thus women are not allocated their own in accordance with their nature, then Plato commits a fallacy, which could have unfortunate effects on the whole notion of justice. In this essay we shall focus on the Republic, the Timaeus and the Laws while leaving out the passing comments of the other dialogues. We shall treat these three dialogues one at a time in an effort to interpret them by their separate arguments. We will follow the arguments in detail and use every mean at our disposal to unveil the argument s implications relevant to our study of Plato s political justice in reference to women. Enjo...|$|R

40|$|Bob Kerrey 2 ̆ 7 s memoir {{begins with}} a promise to his dying father {{to find out what}} {{happened}} to the father 2 ̆ 7 s brother, lost in the Philippines during WWII. This Kerrey did, but instead of writing his uncle 2 ̆ 7 s story, he wrote his own, of growing up in the 1950 s in Lincoln, Nebraska, one of seven children in a solid, church-going, middle-class family. 2 ̆ 2 We biked everywhere, 2 ̆ 2 Kerrey writes. 2 ̆ 2 The edge of the universe lay at the ends of the dirt roads leading to those places where the wild and wooly frontier began. 2 ̆ 2 The fearful things in this safe place were either abstract (Soviet and Martian invasions) or very concrete (spring floods). In the plainest of plain prose, Kerrey records his high school ambitions (to defy his asthma and make the football team like his older brother) and his years at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, where he majored in pharmacy. Although one of his college girlfriends joined the Freedom Riders in 1961, Kerrey confesses that he himself 2 ̆ 2 knew or cared little about the world outside Lincoln. 2 ̆ 2 Looking back, he both loves his childhood and marvels at how fully he accepted its limitations. Yet a note of self-justification intrudes even when he is self-critical: he joined a fraternity with exclusionary membership clauses because he wanted to belong; but he credits the fraternity with giving him 2 ̆ 2 a chance to lead 2 ̆ 2 when he was elected its president. He does not ask himself whom he was leading nor toward what end. In 1966, Kerrey received his draft notice and instead volunteered for the navy and its special forces unit, the SEALS. His attitude toward the war was passive: he could not imagine refusing to serve but hoped it would end before he had to go. Kerrey 2 ̆ 7 s analysis of the war is brief, superficial, and contradictory. He knew little about the conflict when he volunteered and seems not to have learned a great deal since. He is content to believe that the US intervened in the war out of a desire to secure the 2 ̆ 2 freedom and self-determination of the South Vietnamese, 2 ̆ 2 that in the delta, where he fought, people sympathized 2 ̆ 2 with whomever they feared most, 2 ̆ 2 and that the North Vietnamese defeated the US because 2 ̆ 2 we lost the battle for public opinion not only in the United States but also in South Vietnam 2 ̆ 7 s countryside. 2 ̆ 2 He does not explain why South Vietnamese opinion mattered, if fear alone determined people 2 ̆ 7 s sympathies. One dark February night in 1969, Kerrey led his team into the delta village of Thanh Phong, which, the South Vietnamese district chief had assured him, contained no civilians since the entire village was loyal to the National Liberation Front. The goal was to kill or capture high level enemy officials supposedly meeting in the village. First, the inhabitants of a house on the outskirts of the village are killed for fear they would warn the others. Kerrey 2 ̆ 2 did not have to give an order to begin the killing but I could have stopped <b>it</b> and <b>didn</b> 2 ̆ 7 t. 2 ̆ 2 He leaves out who lived in the house: two grandparents and five grandchildren. Next, the team searched several houses in the village, finding no meeting and no men. Meanwhile the women and children had gathered outside the houses, talking loudly. 2 ̆ 2 We had two choices: withdraw or continue to search the houses in the dark. 2 ̆ 2 The choice was apparently made for them: a shot rang out and Kerrey 2 ̆ 7 s team responded with 2 ̆ 2 a tremendous barrage of fire [...] 2 ̆ 2 Here Kerrey hides behind the passive voice: 2 ̆ 2 I saw women and children in front of us being hit and cut to pieces. 2 ̆ 2 At least one member of Kerrey 2 ̆ 7 s team has disputed this version of events, making Kerrey a direct agent in the killing of the family on the outskirts of the village and denying there had been hostile fire in the village...|$|R
