40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} Asian {{understandings of}} the definition of <b>indigenous</b> <b>peoples</b> in international law. The rights of <b>indigenous</b> <b>peoples</b> have emerged strongly in the international domain, culminating in 2007 with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of <b>Indigenous</b> <b>Peoples.</b> Yet, the question of definition and identity of <b>indigenous</b> <b>peoples</b> remains uncertain and indeterminate, at least from an Asian perspective. Traditionally <b>indigenous</b> <b>peoples</b> are understood to be those who were victims of European colonial settlements. It is the aim of this research to find out whether <b>indigenous</b> <b>peoples</b> exist in Asia by analyzing the approaches taken by select Asian states and non-state groups within these states who claim to be <b>indigenous</b> <b>peoples.</b> The thesis also examines whether there are any specific rights belonging to <b>indigenous</b> <b>peoples</b> which have attained the status of customary international law...|$|R
40|$|<b>Indigenous</b> <b>peoples</b> {{are among}} the most {{vulnerable}} people on Earth, yet states are ambivalent about recognizing their rights. Several factors explain this. First, <b>Indigenous</b> <b>peoples</b> have been denied legal personality since the fifteenth century because of cultural, political, and economic differences between <b>Indigenous</b> <b>peoples</b> and Europeans and because recognition was not compatible with colonization. Second, the liberal individualism of the contemporary human rights regime fails to protect and promote the group rights of <b>Indigenous</b> <b>peoples</b> to existence and self-determination. While <b>Indigenous</b> <b>peoples</b> see these rights as inextricably linked, states regard self-determination for <b>Indigenous</b> <b>peoples</b> as an unacceptable challenge to external sovereignty and internal stability...|$|R

5|$|Botanists {{study how}} plants produce food {{and how to}} {{increase}} yields, for example through plant breeding, making their work important to mankind's ability to feed the world and provide food security for future generations. Botanists also study weeds, which are a considerable problem in agriculture, and the biology and control of plant pathogens in agriculture and natural ecosystems. Ethnobotany {{is the study of}} the relationships between plants and people. When applied to the investigation of historical plant–people relationships ethnobotany may be referred to as archaeobotany or palaeoethnobotany. Some of the earliest plant-people relationships arose between the <b>indigenous</b> <b>people</b> of Canada in identifying edible plants from inedible plants. This relationship the <b>indigenous</b> <b>people</b> had with plants was recorded by ethnobotanists.|$|E

5|$|<b>Indigenous</b> <b>people</b> of the Dakelh and Tsilhqot'in tribes have {{inhabited}} {{the area for}} hundreds of years. In pre-contact times, these people lived a nomadic lifestyle. They did not build permanent structures in which to live, as they moved from region to region to find food and resources. Animals such as caribou, martin, moose and caribou were hunted and trapped by the Dakelh and Tsilhqot'in tribes. In summer, these people gathered roots, plants and a volcanic glass called obsidian. Anahim obsidian was traded widely throughout the Interior {{and up and down}} the Coast from the community of Bella Coola. Arrowheads and knives were made from obsidian because when it breaks with a characteristic conchoidal fracture, it creates very sharp edges. A modified form of this lifestyle is practiced by some <b>indigenous</b> <b>people</b> to this day.|$|E

40|$|The {{place of}} <b>Indigenous</b> <b>peoples</b> at the {{intersection}} of domestic and international arenas has shifted. While international law was traditionally used by states to oppress <b>Indigenous</b> <b>peoples,</b> today it can be used by <b>Indigenous</b> <b>peoples</b> to hold states to account and to assert specific demands for continued participation in law and politics at a domestic and international level. This shift is evidenced by the transformation of the concept of indigeneity. This was originally a term imposed upon <b>Indigenous</b> <b>peoples</b> by colonial powers, and was used to bind various groups of <b>Indigenous</b> <b>peoples</b> and to account for state action in relation to them. However, in recent years <b>Indigenous</b> <b>peoples</b> have had a significant stake in creating and clarifying the imposed concept and its contemporary use and meaning. This has transformed indigeneity from a tool of oppression to a tool of potentially greater freedom. For those <b>Indigenous</b> <b>peoples</b> searching for and demanding justice, this suggests a necessary starting point {{at the intersection}} of the domestic and the international...|$|R
