5|$|The Carnegie Ridge is sliding under Ecuadorian land, causing coastal uplift and volcanism. The ridge's {{movement}} {{may also}} have changed the type of faulting along the coast, causing strike-slip <b>faults</b> (<b>faults</b> that move horizontally past each other). Evidence of this subduction altering the course of faulting is found at the Yaquina fault, which, {{unlike the rest of}} the Panama Basin <b>faults,</b> trends to the west instead of north-south, indicating that the Carnegie Ridge may be colliding with the continental mass of Ecuador. This collision created northwest-southeast and northeast-southwest-trending <b>faults</b> in the region, and with that, caused strong earthquakes in Riobamba in 1797 and Alausi in 1961. Several of the northwest-southeast-trending <b>faults</b> converge in the Inter-Andean Valley where the 1949 Ambato earthquake took place.|$|E
5|$|The {{convergence}} {{of the two}} blocks continued even after their collision, generating strike-slip <b>faults.</b> The Saravan fault east of Taftan is one such fault; the 2013 Saravan earthquake occurred on this fault.

5|$|The {{earthquake}} {{originated in}} the Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone, among the most active seismic areas in the Southeastern United States and one capable of producing moderately strong earthquakes, a few of which have caused damage. The frequency for non-damaging earthquakes from this zone measures out to about one per year, and it has produced many faint earthquakes recorded on seismographs. Such earthquakes have been helpful in highlighting the activity of <b>faults</b> below the Paleozoic detachment. Fault-plane solutions of multiple earthquakes throughout the area confirmed strike-slip faulting between two steeply declining planes. Both right and left-lateral movement occurs in the area, most movement being associated with north-to-south planes (right-lateral) and east-to-west planes (left-lateral). All of these mechanisms indicate reactivation of basement <b>faults</b> below more-recent <b>faults.</b> These basement <b>faults</b> probably converge on one another, and one being strong and the other being weak, produce earthquakes.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{its history}} of {{generating}} great earthquakes (1857, 1906) {{the focal point}} of earthquake hazard assessment in California has been the strike-slip San Andreas System of <b>faults.</b> However, a system of <b>faults,</b> including the Sierra Madre–Cucamonga Fault System that runs along the border of the San Gabriel and San Fernando Valleys, has also caused a series of moderate to large events in the Greater Los Angeles Area. The westernmost portion of this fault system ruptured in 1971 and has been identified as one of six major fault systems that pose a threat to the highly populated region.|$|E
5|$|During the Silurian period (444–419 Ma) the {{continent}} of Laurentia gradually collided with Baltica, joining Scotland to the area that would become England and Europe. Sea levels rose as the Ordovician ice sheets melted, and tectonic movements created major <b>faults</b> which assembled the outline of Scotland from previously scattered fragments. These <b>faults</b> are the Highland Boundary Fault, separating the Lowlands from the Highlands, the Great Glen Fault that divides the North-west Highlands from the Grampians, the Southern Uplands Fault and the Iapetus Suture, which runs from the Solway Firth to Lindisfarne and which marks {{the close of the}} Iapetus Ocean and the joining of northern and southern Britain.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} robustness of the AERS (Aero-engine Rotor System) and {{to solve the problem}} of lacking <b>fault</b> samples in <b>fault</b> diagnosis and the difficulty in identifying early weak <b>fault,</b> we proposed a new method that it not only can identify the early <b>fault</b> of AERS but also it can do self-recovery monitoring of <b>fault.</b> Our method is based on the analysis of the early <b>fault</b> features on AERS, and it combined the SVM (Support Vector Machine) with the stochastic resonance theory and the wavelet packet decomposition and <b>fault</b> self-recovery. First, we zoom the early <b>fault</b> feature signals by using the stochastic resonance theory. Second, we extract the feature vectors of early <b>fault</b> using the multi-resolution analysis of the wavelet packet. Third, we input the feature vectors to a <b>fault</b> classifier, which can be used to identify the early <b>fault</b> of AERS and carry out self-recovery monitoring of <b>fault.</b> In this paper, features of early <b>fault</b> on AERS, the zoom of early <b>fault</b> characteristics, the extraction method of early <b>fault</b> characteristics, the construction of multi-fault classifier and way of <b>fault</b> self-recovery monitoring are studied.

5|$|However, most of {{the rocks}} {{have one thing in}} common; the rocks are {{generally}} hard and erosion-resistant. The Rocky Mountain Trench is thought to be a partial graben, or a long narrow strip of land that has dropped in elevation over time because of parallel <b>faults</b> on both sides. <b>Faults</b> in the Kootenay River watershed trend north-northwest to south-southeast as is common in much of British Columbia. The underlying rock is generally stable and contains more outcroppings of metamorphic and igneous rock as one progresses westwards.

5|$|Induction generators, {{which were}} {{often used for}} wind power {{projects}} in the 1980s and 1990s, require reactive power for excitation so substations used in wind-power collection systems include substantial capacitor banks for power factor correction.

5|$|Tensional forces {{forming the}} Basin and Range physiogeographic {{province}} {{to the west}} about 20 to 25million years ago in Tertiary time created the two <b>faults</b> that bound the Markagunt Plateau (which underlies the park): the Sevier Fault on {{the east and the}} Hurricane Fault on the west. The Hurricane fault zone is a major, active, steeply west-dipping normal fault that stretches at least 155miles (250km) from south of the Grand Canyon northward to Cedar City, Utah.
