40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{determine}} the transcriptional expression of mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) in MGC 803 cell lines subjected by various time-phase hypoxic dispositions, and further {{to discuss the}} influence of mtDNA transcripts on hypoxic resistance to irradiation. METHODS The MGC 803 cells exposed to anoxic environment were divided into control group (0 h), hypoxic group (2 h, 8 h, 16 h, 24 h) and irradiated group after <b>exposing</b> <b>the</b> hypoxia. RT-PCR was applied to detect the transcripts of cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI), NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 (ND 4), ND 5, cytochrome b (cyt-b) and ATPase 6 (ATP- 6) in MGC 803 cell lines at various time-phases of hypoxic, and after X-ray irradiation. Flow cytometry and colony formation assay were conducted to evaluate the cell cycle phase and survival fraction. RESULTS COI and ND 4 transcripts of MGC 803 cell lines were influenced remarkably by hypoxia. COI transcripts were decreased remarkably with the elongation time of <b>exposing</b> <b>the</b> hypoxic, and reduced to one fourth of its original amount of pre-hypoxia 24 h after <b>exposing</b> <b>the</b> hypoxia. ND 4 transcripts were increased initially, and elevated to two folds 8 h after <b>exposing</b> <b>the</b> hypoxia, and then reduced to one second 24 h after <b>exposing</b> <b>the</b> hypoxia. Hypoxia resulted in G 1 phase blockage, especially after hypoxia for 16 h. The survival fraction of MGC 803 cells <b>exposing</b> <b>the</b> hypoxia in irradiated group showed that as <b>the</b> time of <b>exposing</b> <b>the</b> hypoxic before irradiation is prolonged, the survival fraction of MGC 803 cells may have an elevated tendency. CONCLUSION The tumor cells with lower expression levels of the COI and the ND 4 after <b>exposing</b> <b>the</b> hypoxic have stronger resistance to the radiation, which indicates that increasing the expression levels of the COI and the ND 4 might be advantageous to enhance the sensitivity of hypoxic tumor cells to the radiotherapy...|$|R

By 2005 and 2006, McCain was pushing for amendments to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act that would limit creation of off-reservation casinos, as well as limiting the movement of tribes across state lines to build casinos.|$|E
5|$|Despite having dark plumage in a {{tropical}} climate, frigatebirds have found ways not to overheat—particularly {{as they are}} exposed to full sunlight when on the nest. They ruffle feathers to lift them away from the skin and improve air circulation, and can extend and upturn their wings to <b>expose</b> <b>the</b> hot undersurface to the air and lose heat by evaporation and convection. Frigatebirds also place their heads in the shade of their wings, and males frequently flutter their gular pouches.|$|E

5|$|Most {{exploitation}} of oil shale involves mining followed by shipping elsewhere, after {{which one can}} burn the shale directly to generate electricity, or undertake further processing. The most common methods of surface mining involve open pit mining and strip mining. These procedures remove most of the overlying material to <b>expose</b> <b>the</b> deposits of oil shale, and become practical when the deposits occur near the surface. Underground mining of oil shale, which removes less of the overlying material, employs the room-and-pillar method.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of his}} {{endeavour}} to <b>expose</b> <b>the</b> {{public to}} more foreign-language works, Johnson facilitated the translation of educational texts, serious fiction, and philosophy (he was less interested in translating popular novels).

His publication of a translation of Constanin Volney's deistic Les Ruines, ou méditations sur les révolutions des empires (1791) quickly became a bestseller. Johnson also had some of the most prominent French children's literature translated, such as the works of Madame de Genlis.|$|E
5|$|Commercial diving {{operations}} may <b>expose</b> <b>the</b> diver to {{more and}} sometimes greater hazards than recreational diving, but the associated occupational {{health and safety}} legislation is less tolerant of risk than recreational, particularly technical divers, may be prepared to accept. Commercial diving operations are also constrained by the physical realities of the operating environment, and expensive engineering solutions are often necessary to control risk. A formal hazard identification and risk assessment is a standard and required part of the planning for a commercial diving operation, and this is also the case for offshore diving operations. The occupation is inherently hazardous, and great effort and expense are routinely incurred to keep the risk within an acceptable range. The standard methods of reducing risk are followed where possible.|$|E
