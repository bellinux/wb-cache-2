5|$|The star fort was {{constructed}} {{in the immediate vicinity}} of medieval Osijek after the defeat of the Ottoman forces in 1687, due to Osijek's strategic importance. Constructed starting in 1712 to plans by Mathias von Kaiserfeld and then Maximilian Gosseau de Henef, all five planned bastions and two gates were complete by 1715. By 1735, the <b>inner</b> <b>town</b> was finished and three northern bastions had been added. When complete, it was the largest and most advanced Habsburg fortress on the border with the Ottoman Empire, consisting of eight bastions and featuring armories, depots, a garrison headquarters, military court, construction office, a garrison physician, guardhouse, officers' apartments, a military hospital and seven barracks. The completed fort was entirely surrounded with walls and palisades and had four main gates at each side (north, south, east, west). Tvrđa had street lights by 1717 and was the site of the first public water supply in Croatia, opened in 1751.|$|E
25|$|The {{network of}} cities in the Second Bulgarian Empire grew in the 13th and 14th centuries; {{numerous}} new urban centres rose to prominence. The cities were usually constructed in difficult-to-access locations and generally consisted of an inner and outer town. The nobility lived in the <b>inner</b> <b>town,</b> which included the citadel, while most citizens inhabited the outer town. There were separate neighbourhoods for the nobility, craftsmen, merchants, and foreigners. The capital Tarnovo had three fortified hills—Tsarevets, Trapezitsa, and Momina Krepost, built along the meanders of the Yantra river. Several neighbourhoods along the river's banks including separate quarters for Western Europeans and Jews.|$|E
25|$|The {{turning point}} for Famagusta was 1192 {{with the onset of}} Lusignan rule. It was during this period that Famagusta {{developed}} as a fully-fledged town. It increased in importance to the Eastern Mediterranean due to its natural harbour and the walls that protected its <b>inner</b> <b>town.</b> Its population began to increase. This development accelerated in the 13th century as the town became a centre of commerce for both the East and West. An influx of Christian refugees fleeing the downfall of Acre (1291) in Palestine transformed it from a tiny village into one of the richest cities in Christendom.|$|E

25|$|The second capital Preslav covered {{an area of}} 5km2 in {{the shape}} of {{irregular}} pentagon and like Pliska was divided into inner and outer town. The city experienced an extensive construction programme under Simeon I who intended it to rival Constantinople. The <b>inner</b> <b>town</b> contained two palaces, called by the archaeologists the Western Palace and the Throne Hall that were linked. Very few elements of the decoration have survived marble plates and two monolith columns of green marble that probably enclosed the arch above the throne. The whole complex was larger than the Pliska Palace and was walled with the bath adjoining the southern wall. A ceremonial road covered with stone plates linked the northern gate and the palace complex and formed a spacious plaza in front of it. The outer town housed estates, churches, monasteries, workshops and dwellings. Adjoined to the outer side of southern gates of the <b>inner</b> <b>town</b> there was a large trading edifice with 18 rooms for commerce on the first floor and accommodation rooms on the second. The most common plan of the commercial, artesian and residential monastic edifices was rectangular with the first floor being used for production, and the second one for living. Some of the buildings had marble or ceramic tile floors, and others had verandas on the second floor. There were two types of plumbingmade of masonry or of clay pipes that brought water from the mountains to the city.|$|E
25|$|After the {{withdrawal}} of the Mongols, Eger began to flourish all over again. Lambert, the bishop of Eger, received a permit from Béla IV for the building a stone fortress. So the nearly destroyed town revived and reached the peak of its medieval development in the l4th and 15th centuries. During this period the forests which spread to the limits of the town were cleared for the most part, and vines were planted in their place. More and more town-houses were built in the settlement. Roads were constructed among which the ones in the <b>inner</b> <b>town</b> were narrow and twisting but those leading to the northern mining towns were wider. The versions surrounding settlements such as Almagyar and Czigléd were built up along with Eger.|$|E
25|$|Once {{inside the}} fort, the Ottoman troops {{surrounded}} the city, digging trenches around and placing artillery {{to break down}} the walls. On a nearby hill were also installed several culverins to bombard the <b>inner</b> <b>town.</b> Martín de Córdoba, who had less than 500 men available to defend the city, prepared for the assault. This one took place on 20 May. Hassan sent ahead to 12,000 alarabs to break the resistance of the Spanish harquebusiers and facilitate the assault to two columns of regular troops which would attack secondly. Despite the heavy losses they suffered, the alarabs managed to scale the walls and raise the Ottoman flag on the battlements. However, the Spanish expelled them soon. In that attack nearly 2,500 men died, mostly falling into the moat around the town.|$|E

25|$|Between 2 and 4 August, the French army {{under the}} general command of Marshal Jacques Henri de Durfort de Duras again crossed the Rhine river {{and began the}} {{destruction}} of major towns in Baden. On 10 August 1689, a French army unit {{under the command of}} General Ezéchiel du Mas, Comte de Mélac appeared in front of Pforzheims town gates, but this time the town refused to surrender. In response, the French army began shelling the town with cannons from the Rod hill located southwest of the town, and the several hundred soldiers of the German imperial command, who were defending the town, were forced to surrender. After a short period of looting, the French troops set the <b>inner</b> <b>town</b> area on fire on 15 August, which made that area uninhabitable for several weeks. Then the French moved on.|$|E
25|$|The {{density of}} the network of towns was large. The {{economic}} historian Paul Bairoch estimated that in 800 Pliska had 30,000 inhabitants and around 950 Preslav had some 60,000 making it the largest city in non-Muslim Europe, save Constantinople. In comparison, the largest cities in contemporary France and Italy did not reach 30,000 and 50,000 respectively. Alongside the two capitals existed other prominent urban centres that made Bulgaria the most urbanised region in Christian Europe at the time along with Italy. According to contemporary chronicles there were 80 towns only {{in the region of}} the lower Danube. Surviving sources list more than 100 settlements in the western areas of the Empire where the Bulgarian Orthodox Church possessed properties. The larger urban centres consisted of inner and outer town. The <b>inner</b> <b>town</b> would be encircled with stone walls and had administrative and defence functions, while the outer town, usually unprotected, was the centre of economic activities with markets, workshops, vineyards, gardens and dwelling for the populace. However, {{it should be noted that}} as elsewhere in the Early Middle Ages, the country remained predominantly rural.|$|E
25|$|Following their {{withdraw}} from Canton, the British relocated the expeditionary force to Hong Kong. Just {{as with the}} Chinese commanders, the British leaders debated how the war should be continued. Elliot wanted to cease military operations and reopen trade, while Major General Gough wanted to capture the city of Amoy and blockade the Yangtze River. In July a typhoon struck Hong Kong, damaging British ships in the harbor and destroying some of the facilities the expedition was building on the island. The situation changed when on 29 July Elliot was informed {{that he had been}} replaced as Superintendent by Henry Pottinger, who arrived in Hong Kong on 10 August to begin his administration. Pottinger wanted to negotiate terms with the Qing for the entire country of China, rather than just the Pearl River, and so he turned away Chinese envoys from Canton and gave permission for the expeditionary force to proceed with their war plans. Admiral Sir William Parker also arrived in Hong Kong to replace Humphrey Fleming Senhouse (who had died of a fever on 29 June) as the commander of the British naval forces in China. Admiral Parker was a proponent of combined operations between the navy and army, and believed that these tactics could be implemented against the Chinese. It was agreed by the British commanders that combat operations should be moved north to put pressure on Beijing, and on 21 August the fleet sailed for Amoy. On 25 August the British fleet entered the Jiulong River estuary and arrived at Amoy. The city was prepared for a naval assault, as Qing military engineers had built several artillery batteries into the granite cliffs overlooking the river. A purely naval assault was considered too risky by Parker, prompting Gough to order a combined naval and ground attack on the defenses. On 26 August British marines and regular infantry (under the covering fire of the Royal Navy) flanked and destroyed the Chinese defenses guarding the river. Several large British ships failed to destroy the largest of the Chinese batteries (which withstood over 12,000 cannonballs fired at it), so the position was scaled and captured by the British infantry. The city of Amoy was abandoned on 27 August, and British soldiers entered the <b>inner</b> <b>town</b> where they blew up the citadel's powder magazine. 26 Chinese junks and 128 cannons were captured, with the captured guns being thrown into the river by the British. As Lord Palmerston wanted Amoy to become an international trade port {{at the end of the}} war, Gough ordered that no looting be tolerated and had officers enforce the death penalty for anyone found to be plundering. However, many Chinese merchants refused to ask for British protection out of fear of being branded as traitors to the Qing dynasty. The British withdrew to an island on the river, where they established a small garrison and blockaded the Jiulong River. With the city empty of any army, peasants, criminals, and deserters looted the town. The Qing army retook the city and restored order several days later, after which the city governor declared that a victory had been won and 5 British ships sunk.|$|E

2500|$|Korneuburg has {{an almost}} ovoid layout [...] The large {{rectangular}} grid plan layout {{with a large}} square in the centre has been compared with Silesian town layouts and presumably represents a re-design of the internal layout {{at the start of}} the 14th century, within the older town defences. Typical of this Silesian layout is the Market Square with the ‘Ringplatz’, with an isolated ‘Rathhaus’ or Town Hall in the centre, which was surrounded by the market. Originally Klosterneuburg and Kornueburg were administered together as ‘Nivenburg’. Kornueberg had market rights by 1114 and was granted a charter in 1298 by Duke Albrecht I, which led to the formal separation of Kornueburg from Klosterneuburg. in 1298 by Duke AlbrechtI I. [...] Also by this charter the town was to have ‘landesfürstliche Festung’, implying that the Emperor rather than the citizens were responsible for the maintenance of the wall. The main information for the defences comes from the plan of the defences published by Merian about 1650. This shows a double wall, and beyond this a water-filled moat circling the town. [...] At various strategic points there were ravelins, which were moated. Three gates, the Kloster Tor, the Viener Tor and the Schiff Tor, each had a circular moated barbican in front of them, presumably with a drawbridge.

2500|$|With the {{completion}} of mine clearing operations on the Turkish portion of the site, archaeological work was resumed in September 2011. Excavations in the Inner and Outer Towns were carried out by a joint Turco-Italian team from the Universities of Bologna , Gaziantep [...] and Istanbul [...] {{under the direction of}} Prof. Dr. Nicolò Marchetti. The second season, from August to November 2012, brought several new art findings and archaeological discoveries, the most remarkable of which is Katuwa's Palace (c. 900 BC) to the east of the Processional Entry. The third season, from May to October 2013, extended the exposure of Katuwa's palace, retrieving a cuneiform tablet with an exorcism {{in the name of the}} god Marduk, as well as the ruins of Lawrence's excavation house in the <b>Inner</b> <b>Town,</b> from which literally hundreds of fragments of sculptures and hieroglyphic inscriptions have been retrieved. The fourth season started in May 2014 and continued through October 2014: in Katuwa's palace several orthostats exquisitely carved with a procession of gazelle-bearers have been found, some of them in situ, next to a courtyard paved with squared slabs. In the Neo Assyrian period that courtyard was covered by a mosaic floor made of river pebbles forming squares alternating in black and white color. Lawrence's excavation house was completely excavated. During the fifth season, April to October 2015, more significant discoveries have been made in the palace area, both for Late Hittite sculptures, and Neo Assyrian refurbishments, with tens of items - including two fragments of clay prysmatical cylinders inscribed with a unique cuneiform text by Sargon, intended for display, telling how he captured and reorganized the city of Karkemish - retrieved in a 14-m-deep well, sealed in 605 BC at the time of the Late Babyonian takeover. The sixth season, May to July 2016, saw a number of excavation areas opened also near the border, due to the added security represented by the construction of the wall (see below). Thus, in 2016 a complete stratigraphic record was obtained also for peripheral areas, greatly adding to our understanding of urban development between LB II and the Achaemenid period. In the seventh season, from 7th May to 18th July 2017, the major breakthroughs were the beginning of the excavations on the north-western end of the acropolis and the discovery in the eastern Lower Palace area of a monumental building dating from the LB II. Among the finds, in addition to new sculpted complete artworks from the Iron Age, fragments of Imperial Hittite clay cuneiform tablets and c. 250 inscribed bullae should be mentioned.
