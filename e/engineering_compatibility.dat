40|$|Background: Software {{developers}} are facing increased pressure to lower development time, release new software versions more frequent to customers and {{to adapt to}} a faster market. This new environment forces developers and companies to move from a plan based waterfall development process to a flexible agile process. By minimizing the pre development planning and instead increasing the communication between customers and developers, the agile process tries to create a new, more flexible way of working. This new way of working allows developers to focus their efforts on the features that customers want. With increased connectability and the faster feature release, the security of the software product is stressed. To develop secure software, many companies use security engineering processes that are plan heavy and inflexible. These two approaches are each others opposites and they directly contradict each other. Objective: The objective of the thesis is to evaluate how to develop secure software in an agile process. In particular, what existing best practices can be incorporated into an agile project and still provide the same benefit if the project was using a waterfall process. How the best practices can be incorporated and adapted to fit the process while still measuring the improvement. Some security engineering concepts are useful but the best practice is not agile compatible and would require extensive adaptation to integrate with an agile project. Method: The primary research method used throughout the thesis is case studies conducted in a real industry setting. As secondary methods for data collection a variety of approaches have been used, such as semi-structured interviews, workshops, study of literature, and use of historical data from the industry. Results: The security engineering best practices were investigated though a series of case studies. The base agile and security <b>engineering</b> <b>compatibility</b> was assessed in literature, by developers and in practical studies. The security engineering best practices were group based on their purpose and their compatibility with the agile process. One well known and popular best practice, automated static code analysis, was toughly investigated for its usefulness, deployment and risks of using as part of the process. For the risk analysis practices, a novel approach was introduced and improved. As such, a way of adapting existing practices to agile is proposed. Conclusion: With regard of agile and security engineering we did not find that any of the investigated processes was agile compatible. Agile is reaction driven that adapts to change, while the security engineering processes are proactive and try to prevent threats before they happen. To develop secure software in an agile process the developers should adopt and adapt key concepts from security engineering. These changes will affect the flexibility of the agile process but it is a necessity if developers want the same software security state as security engineering processes can provide...|$|E

50|$|The 2005 RL {{was also}} the first Honda vehicle to use the Advanced <b>Compatibility</b> <b>Engineering</b> (ACE) body structure, which has since proliferated {{throughout}} every newly introduced Honda and Acura vehicle design. The ACE structure features extensive use of high-tensile steel and lightweight aluminum components in a front-mounted polygonal main frame, designed to engage vehicles of differing size and weight in a frontal collision and spread the forces through multiple structural pathways, while preventing or minimizing cabin deformation. In practical terms, this means in an SUV versus ACE structure car collision, there is a greater chance that the ACE body structure will engage with the SUV's frame and dissipate collision forces around the passenger compartment. In more conventional non-ACE car structures, the SUV frame has a much greater chance of missing or over-riding the conventional car's major structural components and a greater chance of deforming the passenger compartment.|$|R

The front airbags use a dual-threshold, dual-stage technology that can adjust the timing and speed of each airbag deployment depending on the degree of impact and the driver's or front passenger's seat belt usage. If sensors deem the front passenger too small (less than 65 lb), the front airbag is designed not to deploy. The front passenger's side airbag is also designed to shut off if a child or small-statured adult is leaning into the airbag's deployment path.

Before Trilinos version 11. 0, released in 2012, Epetra used the C++ int data-type for storing global and local indices for degrees of freedom (DOFs). Since int is typically 32 -bit, this limited the largest problem size to be smaller than approximately two billion DOFs. This was true even if a distributed memory machine could handle larger problems. We have added optional support for C++ long long data-type, which is at least 64 -bit wide, for global indices. To save memory, maintain the speed of memory-bound operations, and reduce further changes to the code, the local indices are still 32 -bit.

The Random Coupling Model in conjunction with Random Matrix Theory thus makes explicit predictions for the statistical aspect (Probability Density Functions-PDFs) of the impedance, admittance and scattering fluctuations of waves within such wave-chaotic cavities. More importantly, these fluctuations are expected to be universal in that their statistical description depends only upon the value of a single dimensionless cavity loss-parameter. This universality in the impedance, admittance and scattering properties is not restricted to electromagnetic systems, but is equally applicable to analogous quantities in quantum-mechanical or acoustic systems, which also comprise of short-wavelength waves confined within complicated-shaped potential wells or acoustic-resonators. In this dissertation, I will experimentally show the validity of the "radiation impedance" to accurately quantify the port-coupling characteristics. I will experimentally prove the existence of these universal fluctuations in the impedance, admittance and scattering properties of quasi-two-dimensional and three-dimensional wave-chaotic systems driven by one-port or two-ports, and validate that their statistical nature is described through Random Matrix Theory. Finally, I will utilize the Random Coupling Model to formulate a prediction-algorithm to determine the shape and scales of induced voltages PDFs at specific points within complicated enclosures, such as computer boxes, when irradiated by high-intensity, short-wavelength electromagnetic energy. The insight gained from the experimental validation of the Random Coupling Model allows one to conceive of certain design-guidelines for cavity-enclosures that are more resistant to attack from an external short-wavelength electromagnetic source...|$|R
