The topics of wildlife conservation and global ecological accountability warrant a depth that the author seems unwilling to give her book." [...] Kirkus Reviews referred to the book as [...] "an enlightening cautionary take" [...] and [...] "a charmingly personal account", but also as [...] "loosely organized and occasionally sparse on detail". John Wilkes, in the Los Angeles Times, wrote, [...] "Although naive and overdrawn at times, this heartfelt tale will bring tears and smiles {{to even the most}} stubbornly objective reader." [...] Donna Mitchell, writing in The Wilson Bulletin (now The Wilson Journal of Ornithology), wrote that Houle's interpretation of the falcons' behavior is excessively [...] "anthropomorphic", but also that [...] "Ms. Houle's perseverance and dedication to the protection of the Peregrine Falcon is admirable and an incentive not only to young biologists just getting started but {{to those of us who}} <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than discouraged with the struggle to protect endangered species and their habitats." ...|$|E
500|$|For the {{majority}} of the recordings, Saadiq played most of the instruments, including bass, keyboard, guitar, Mellotron, percussion, and drums, and he also layered each recorded instrumental part afterwards. Brungardt used a Neumann U 47 microphone to record each of Saadiq's instrument parts. Saadiq recorded his vocals on a dynamic microphone alone in the recording studio's control room, an approach encouraged to him earlier in his career by record producer and audio engineer Gerry Brown. According to Brungardt, [...] " [...] voice benefits from a dynamic mic because it tends to give him more bottom and presence. Plus dynamic mics can sound a little older when pushed". With the songs' guitar parts, Brungardt wanted to create additional distortion in order to produce a grittier guitar sound for the songs, a stylistic preference Saadiq and he had acquired from listening to a great deal of indie rock at the time. He applied several techniques to achieve this sound, including increasing the gain on Saadiq's Fender Twin guitar amplifier, using a software plug-in for the recordings in post-production, and re-amping Saadiq's guitar parts. In his interview for EQ Magazine, Brungardt discussed using a Massey TapeHead, one of his preferred plug-ins, in the recording process, stating [...] "I’ll use that {{on a lot of things}} to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> grit. It thickens stuff up nicely if you record something that’s a little too bright. I usually go a lot for darker tones when recording and mixing".|$|E

[...] What had set the Colts apart from the other bidders was a clause they agreed to insert into Wolford’s new contract. [...] It {{guaranteed}} that Will Wolford, left tackle, would remain the highest paid player on the Colts’ offense {{for as long as he}} played on it. [...] Better paid than the Colts’ running backs, the Colts’ wide receivers, or any of the other acknowledged stars. [...] Even if the Colts went out and got themselves the NFL’s most expensive quarterback, Wolford’s salary would rise to eclipse his, too. [...] “I thought linemen would <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> money from free agency,” said Wolford later. [...] “But I didn’t think that would happen. [...] I was numb.” ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{the mid-1980s}} Hüsker Dü became SST's star attraction, their strong songwriting and {{increasingly}} melodic music becoming the key link between hardcore and the developing sound of college rock. The steady recording and release of records by the band (which released three albums {{over the course}} of 1984 and 1985) created an influx of income for the label and afforded it leverage to gather payment from distributors for other releases. However, the band felt that SST did not devote enough attention to its releases; Hüsker Dü drummer Grant Hart said after the band left the label, [...] "I think there's a little reluctance on their part to let anything <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> attention than Black Flag." [...] In 1985, Hüsker Dü wanted to self-produce its third studio album, New Day Rising. Ignoring the band's wishes, SST assigned Spot to supervise the sessions. Grant Hart later explained: [...] "We had no other choice but to work with him. SST made us work with him". Aware of the tension, Spot [...] "had to do what the record company wanted". New Day Rising, as a result, became one of the last recordings Spot did for the label, and the band soon signed to major label Warner Bros. Records.|$|E
2500|$|The Salt Lake Tribune {{said that}} the album [...] "largely drops the punk-by-numbers that {{dominated}} past efforts to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> personal lyrically, thus becoming more approachable." [...] Alan Sculley of The Daily Herald explained that, [...] "Coming Home pretty much leaves any punk element behind. The songs still rock - just note the wallop delivered by [...] "Hold My Hand" [...] or [...] "Connected." [...] But the band pulls back on the tempos of {{virtually all of the}} songs." [...] Scene Point Blank writer Chris Abraham noted, [...] "Coming Home still encompasses the things that make New Found Glory great. Relatable lyrics, hooks so melodic and catchy that my hands are red from not buying a mitt, and, despite a mellower tone, I could still imagine myself going fucking nuts singing along to these songs live." [...] AbsolutePunk founder Jason Tate warned that, [...] "it's crucial you abandon any pre-conceived expectations for this album. If you're anticipating the band's previous albums re-hashed, you're going to be completely let-down. While the choruses and sing-a-long hooks could compete with the best on any of their previous albums - it's the slower melodic approach to the songs that truly makes the album come alive and fully breathe." [...] Rae Alexandra of Kerrang! magazine called the album a [...] "massive departure" [...] and suggested that, [...] "NFG are taking what will be, by far, the biggest gamble of their career. Some of you won't even recognise them immediately; it's not fast, it's not forced, but - in an entirely new way - it soars." [...] In an earlier Kerrang! article discussing the album, Alexandra wrote that [...] "It's Not Your Fault" [...] displays [...] "more maturity - and piano - than ever before", while [...] "When I Die" [...] is [...] "low key with orchestral accents", making it [...] "one of the most beautiful moments on Coming Home." [...] Corey Apar of AllMusic was in agreement and stated that [...] "from the album's packaging to the comfortable nature of the music, it actually feels more mature {{in a way that is}} catchy without seeming to care about radio accessibility." ...|$|E
