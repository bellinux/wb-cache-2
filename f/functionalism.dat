5|$|Despite Putnam's {{rejection}} of <b>functionalism,</b> it {{has continued to}} flourish and has been developed into numerous versions by thinkers as diverse as David Marr, Daniel Dennett, Jerry Fodor, and David Lewis. <b>Functionalism</b> helped lay the foundations for modern cognitive science and is the dominant theory of mind in philosophy today.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Putnam {{abandoned}} his adherence to <b>functionalism</b> and other computational theories of mind. His change of mind was {{primarily due to}} the difficulties that computational theories have in explaining certain intuitions {{with respect to the}} externalism of mental content. This is illustrated by Putnam's own Twin Earth thought experiment (see Philosophy of language). He also developed a separate argument against <b>functionalism</b> in 1988, based on Fodor's generalized version of multiple realizability. Asserting that <b>functionalism</b> is really a watered-down identity theory in which mental kinds are identified with functional kinds, Putnam argued that mental kinds may be multiply realizable over functional kinds. The argument for <b>functionalism</b> is that the same mental state could be implemented by the different states of a universal Turing machine.|$|E
5|$|<b>Functionalism</b> was {{formulated}} by Hilary Putnam and Jerry Fodor {{as a reaction}} to the inadequacies of the identity theory. Putnam and Fodor saw mental states in terms of an empirical computational theory of the mind. At about the same time or slightly after, D.M. Armstrong and David Kellogg Lewis formulated a version of <b>functionalism</b> that analyzed the mental concepts of folk psychology in terms of functional roles. Finally, Wittgenstein's idea of meaning as use led to a version of <b>functionalism</b> as a theory of meaning, further developed by Wilfrid Sellars and Gilbert Harman. Another one, psychofunctionalism, is an approach adopted by the naturalistic philosophy of mind associated with Jerry Fodor and Zenon Pylyshyn.|$|E
5|$|One {{can solve}} these problems, {{according}} to Fodor, with <b>functionalism,</b> a hypothesis {{which was designed}} to overcome the failings of both dualism and reductionism. What is important is the function of a mental state regardless of the physical substrate which implements it. The foundation for this view lies in the principle of the multiple realizability of the mental. Under this view, for example, I and a computer can both instantiate ("realize") the same functional state though we are made of completely different material stuff (see graphic at right). On this basis <b>functionalism</b> can be classified as a form of token materialism.|$|E
5|$|It was not, however, {{until the}} 1960s that Danish architects entered the world scene with their highly {{successful}} <b>Functionalism.</b> This, in turn, {{has evolved into}} more recent world-class masterpieces such as the Sydney Opera House and the Great Belt Bridge {{paving the way for}} a number of Danish designers to be rewarded for excellence both at home and abroad.|$|E
5|$|Today, such a {{position}} is often adopted by interpreters of Wittgenstein such as Peter Hacker. However, Hilary Putnam, the originator of <b>functionalism,</b> has also adopted {{the position that the}} mind–body problem is an illusory problem which should be dissolved according to the manner of Wittgenstein.|$|E
5|$|What {{all these}} {{different}} varieties of <b>functionalism</b> share in common is the thesis that mental states are characterized by their causal relations with other mental states and with sensory inputs and behavioral outputs. That is, <b>functionalism</b> abstracts away from {{the details of the}} physical implementation of a mental state by characterizing it in terms of non-mental functional properties. For example, a kidney is characterized scientifically by its functional role in filtering blood and maintaining certain chemical balances. From this point of view, it does not really matter whether the kidney be made up of organic tissue, plastic nanotubes or silicon chips: it is the role that it plays and its relations to other organs that define it as a kidney.|$|E
5|$|Aarhus has {{developed}} in stages, from the Viking age to modern times, all {{visible in the}} city today. Many architectural styles are represented {{in different parts of}} the city such as Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, Rococo, National Romantic, Nordic Classicism, Neoclassical, Empire and <b>Functionalism.</b> The city has grown up around the main transport hubs, the river, the harbour and later the railway station, and as a result, the oldest parts of the city are also the most central and busiest today.|$|E
5|$|Establishment of {{sociology}} as an independent, recognized academic discipline is amongst Durkheim's {{largest and most}} lasting legacies. Within sociology, his work has significantly influenced structuralism or structural <b>functionalism.</b> Scholars inspired by Durkheim include Marcel Mauss, Maurice Halbwachs, Célestin Bouglé, Alfred Radcliffe-Brown, Talcott Parsons, Robert K. Merton, Jean Piaget, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Ferdinand de Saussure, Michel Foucault, Clifford Geertz, Peter Berger, Robert Bellah, social reformer Patrick Hunout and others.|$|E
5|$|Fodor {{argues that}} mental states, such as beliefs and desires, are {{relations}} between individuals and mental representations. He maintains that these representations {{can only be}} correctly {{explained in terms of}} a language of thought (LOT) in the mind. Furthermore, this language of thought itself is an actually existing thing that is codified in the brain and not just a useful explanatory tool. Fodor adheres to a species of <b>functionalism,</b> maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language of thought.|$|E
5|$|In {{philosophy}} of mind, Putnam {{is known for}} his argument against the type-identity of mental and physical states based on his hypothesis of the multiple realizability of the mental, and for the concept of <b>functionalism,</b> an influential theory regarding the mind–body problem. In {{philosophy of}} language, along with Saul Kripke and others, he developed the causal theory of reference, and formulated an original theory of meaning, introducing the notion of semantic externalism based on a famous thought experiment called Twin Earth.|$|E
5|$|Jerry Fodor, Putnam, {{and others}} noted that, along with being an {{effective}} argument against type-identity theories, multiple realizability implies that any low-level explanation of higher-level mental phenomena is insufficiently abstract and general. <b>Functionalism,</b> which identifies mental kinds with functional kinds that are characterized exclusively {{in terms of}} causes and effects, abstracts from the level of microphysics, and therefore {{seemed to be a}} better explanation of the relation between mind and body. In fact, there are many functional kinds, such as mousetraps, software and bookshelves, which are multiply realized at the physical level.|$|E
5|$|The {{architectural}} {{designs of}} these projects have reflected not only the style currents of their time, but the societal debate over the purpose they were intended to serve. Nationalistic ambitions early on gave way to austere designs based on <b>functionalism,</b> and then to designs that emphasized human and ecological needs. To a great extent, Norwegian architects have found {{the opportunity to develop}} their signature styles through these projects, and thereby also a Norwegian architectural dialect.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} {{evolution}} was widely accepted in scientific circles {{within a few}} years of the publication of Origin, but the acceptance of natural selection as its driving mechanism was much less widespread. The four major alternatives to natural selection in the late 19th century were theistic evolution, neo-Lamarckism, orthogenesis, and saltationism. Alternatives supported by biologists at other times included structuralism, Georges Cuvier's teleological but non-evolutionary <b>functionalism,</b> and vitalism.|$|E
5|$|The {{contemporary}} {{discipline of}} sociology is theoretically multi-paradigmatic {{as a result}} of the contentions of classical social theory. In Randall Collins' well-cited survey of sociological theory he retroactively labels various theorists as belonging to four theoretical traditions: <b>Functionalism,</b> Conflict, Symbolic Interactionism, and Utilitarianism. Modern sociological theory descends predominately from functionalist (Durkheim) and conflict-centred (Marx and Weber) accounts of social structure, as well as the symbolic interactionist tradition consisting of micro-scale structural (Simmel) and pragmatist (Mead, Cooley) theories of social interaction. Utilitarianism, also known as Rational Choice or Social Exchange, although often associated with economics, is an established tradition within sociological theory. Lastly, as argued by Raewyn Connell, a tradition that is often forgotten is that of Social Darwinism, which brings the logic of Darwinian biological evolution and applies it to people and societies. This tradition often aligns with classical <b>functionalism.</b> It was the dominant theoretical stance in American sociology from around 1881 to 1915 and is associated with several founders of sociology, primarily Herbert Spencer, Lester F. Ward and William Graham Sumner. Contemporary sociological theory retains traces of each of these traditions and they are by no means mutually exclusive.|$|E
5|$|<b>Functionalism,</b> {{which began}} in the 1930s, relied on {{rational}} architecture making use of bricks, concrete, iron and glass, preferably to meet social needs. Its main proponents in Denmark were Frits Schlegel, Mogens Lassen, Vilhelm Lauritzen and, especially Arne Jacobsen with his Bellavista developments north of Copenhagen. Another of Jacobsen's masterpieces was the Aarhus City Hall which he designed together with Erik Møller in 1937 and completed in 1948. The tower is 60 meters tall and the tower clock face has a diameter of 7 meters. The building is made of concrete plated with marble from Porsgrunn in Norway.|$|E
5|$|Social {{stratification}} is {{the hierarchical}} arrangement of individuals into social classes, castes, and divisions within a society. Modern Western societies stratification traditionally relates to {{cultural and economic}} classes arranged in three main layers: upper class, middle class, and lower class, but each class may be further subdivided into smaller classes (e.g. occupational). Social stratification is interpreted in radically different ways within sociology. Proponents of structural <b>functionalism</b> suggest that, since the stratification of classes and castes is evident in all societies, hierarchy must be beneficial in stabilizing their existence. Conflict theorists, by contrast, critique the inaccessibility of resources and lack of social mobility in stratified societies.|$|E
5|$|Childe {{has been}} {{considered}} the principal contributor to archaeological methodology {{in the first part}} of the 20th century. His theoretical approach blended together Marxism, diffusionism, and <b>functionalism.</b> Childe was critical of the evolutionary archaeology which was dominant during the 19thcentury. He believed that those archaeologists who adhered to it placed a greater emphasis on artefacts themselves rather than their makers. He recognised flaws in the technological-based three-age system first developed by Danish antiquarian Christian Jürgensen Thomsen, rejecting its evolutionary chronology that divided prehistory into the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age by noting that many of the world's societies were still effectively Stone Age in their technology. He nevertheless saw it as a useful model for analysing socio-economic development when combined with a Marxist model. He therefore used technological criteria for dividing up prehistory into three ages, but instead used economic criteria for sub-dividing the Stone Age into the Palaeolithic and Neolithic, rejecting the concept of the Mesolithic as useless.|$|E
5|$|The streets Volden (The Rampart) and Graven (The Moat) {{testify to}} the defences of the initial Viking {{settlement}} and Allégaderingen in Midtbyen roughly follows the boundaries of that settlement. The street network {{in the inner city}} formed during the Middle Ages with narrow, curved streets and low, dense housing by the river and coast. Vesterport (Westward Gate) still bears the name of a medieval city gate and the narrow alleyways Posthussmøgen and Telefonsmøgen are remnants of toll stations from that time. The inner city has the oldest preserved buildings, especially the Latin Quarter, with houses dating back to the early 17thcentury in Mejlgade and Skolegade. Medieval merchants' mansions with courtyards can be seen in Klostergade, Studsgade and Skolegade. By far, the largest part of the present day city was built during and after the industrialization of the late 1800s and the most represented architectural styles are historicism and modernism, especially Danish <b>functionalism</b> of which there are many fine examples.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} years, companies applied {{the principles of}} corporate identity and corporate design to increase awareness and recognition by consumers and differentiation from competitors. Olivetti became famous for its attention to design through their corporate design activities. In 1936 Olivetti hired Giovanni Pintori in their publicity department and promoted Marcello Nizzoli from the product design department to develop design in a comprehensive corporate philosophy. In 1956, inspired by the compelling brand character of Olivetti, Thomas Watson, Jr., CEO of IBM, retained American architect and industrial designer Eliot Noyes to develop a corporate-wide IBM Design Program consisting of coherent brand-design strategy together with a design management system to guide and oversee the comprehensive brand identity elements of: products, graphics, exhibits, architecture, interiors and fine art. This seminal effort by Noyes, with his inclusion of Paul Rand and Charles Eames as consultants, {{is considered to be}} the first comprehensive corporate design program in America. Up to and during the 1960s, debates in the design community were focused on ergonomics, <b>functionalism,</b> and corporate design, while debates in management addressed Just in time, Total quality management, and product specification. The main proponents of design management at that time were AEG, Bauhaus, HfG Ulm, the British Design Council, Deutscher Werkbund, Olivetti, IBM, Peter Behrens, and Walter Paepcke.|$|E
5|$|Monism is the {{position}} that mind and body are not ontologically distinct entities (independent substances). This view was first advocated in Western philosophy by Parmenides in the 5th century BC and was later espoused by the 17th century rationalist Baruch Spinoza. Physicalists argue that only entities postulated by physical theory exist, and that mental processes will eventually be {{explained in terms of}} these entities as physical theory continues to evolve. Physicalists maintain various positions on the prospects of reducing mental properties to physical properties (many of whom adopt compatible forms of property dualism), and the ontological status of such mental properties remains unclear. Idealists maintain that the mind is all that exists and that the external world is either mental itself, or an illusion created by the mind. Neutral monists such as Ernst Mach and William James argue that events in the world {{can be thought of as}} either mental (psychological) or physical depending on the network of relationships into which they enter, and dual-aspect monists such as Spinoza adhere to {{the position}} that there is some other, neutral substance, and that both matter and mind are properties of this unknown substance. The most common monisms in the 20th and 21st centuries have all been variations of physicalism; these positions include behaviorism, the type identity theory, anomalous monism and <b>functionalism.</b>|$|E
25|$|Theoretical {{perspectives}} used in criminology include psychoanalysis, <b>functionalism,</b> interactionism, Marxism, econometrics, systems theory, postmodernism, genetics, neuropsychology, evolutionary psychology, etc.|$|E
25|$|Another Western {{country in}} which constructivism had a strong {{influence}} was former Czechoslovakia when it was the main source for a development of a specific Czech and Slovak form of <b>functionalism.</b> The most known constructivist building in former Czechoslovakia is probably the Commercial and Residential Centre Manderla in Bratislava. The first propagators of constructivism and later <b>functionalism</b> in Czechoslovakia were Jiří Grossmann and Alois Balán. They were activ above all in Bratislava which in 1920s–1930s became a new dynamic capital.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} monisms in the 20th and 21st centuries {{have all been}} {{variations}} of physicalism; these positions include behaviorism, the type identity theory, anomalous monism and <b>functionalism.</b>|$|E
25|$|Archaeological theory now borrows from a {{wide range}} of influences, {{including}} neo-evolutionary thought, phenomenology, postmodernism, agency theory, cognitive science, structural <b>functionalism,</b> gender-based and feminist archaeology, and systems theory.|$|E
25|$|During {{this time}} notable anthropologists such as Mintz, Murphy, Sahlins, and Wolf {{eventually}} broke away; experimenting with structuralist and Marxist approaches to culture, {{they continued to}} promote cultural anthropology against structural <b>functionalism.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many {{current and}} recent philosophers—e.g., Daniel Dennett, Willard Van Orman Quine, Donald Davidson, and Jerry Fodor—operate within a broadly physicalist or materialist framework, {{producing}} rival accounts of {{how best to}} accommodate mind, including <b>functionalism,</b> anomalous monism, identity theory, and so on.|$|E
25|$|The {{field of}} {{educational}} psychology involves the study of memory, conceptual processes, and individual differences (via cognitive psychology) in conceptualizing new strategies for learning processes in humans. Educational psychology has been built upon theories of operant conditioning, <b>functionalism,</b> structuralism, constructivism, humanistic psychology, Gestalt psychology, and information processing.|$|E
25|$|Helsinki also {{features}} several buildings by Finnish architect Alvar Aalto, {{recognized as one}} of the pioneers of architectural <b>functionalism.</b> However, some of his works, such as the headquarters of the paper company Stora Enso and the concert venue Finlandia Hall, have been subject to divided opinions from the citizens.|$|E
25|$|Like {{the other}} {{stations}} along the Sørlandet Line, the station building at Nodeland received a standardized design. It {{was built in}} the overall Neoclassical architecture style adapted in the 1920s. By the 1940s the designs had been altered to include elements of <b>functionalism.</b> It has siding of weatherboard.|$|E
25|$|Until a {{resurgence}} of interest for the period during the 1980s (marked by several scholarly studies and public exhibitions), Nordic Classicism {{was regarded as a}} mere interlude between two far more well-known architectural movements, National Romanticism or Jugendstil (often seen as equivalent or parallel to Art Nouveau) and <b>Functionalism</b> (aka Modernism).|$|E
25|$|Like {{the other}} {{stations}} along the Sørlandet Line, the now demolished station building at Breland received a standardized design. It {{was built in}} the overall Neoclassical architecture style adapted in the 1920s. By the 1940s the designs had been altered to include elements of <b>functionalism.</b> It has siding of weatherboard.|$|E
25|$|Cognitive {{psychology}} studies cognition, {{the mental}} processes underlying mental activity. Perception, attention, reasoning, thinking, problem solving, memory, learning, language, and emotion are areas of research. Classical cognitive psychology {{is associated with}} a school of thought known as cognitivism, whose adherents argue for an information processing model of mental function, informed by <b>functionalism</b> and experimental psychology.|$|E
25|$|Although the Chinese Room {{argument}} was originally presented {{in reaction to}} the statements of AI researchers, philosophers have come to view it as {{an important part of the}} philosophy of mind. It is a challenge to <b>functionalism</b> and the computational theory of mind, and is related to such questions as the mind–body problem, the problem of other minds, the symbol-grounding problem, and the hard problem of consciousness.|$|E
25|$|Analytical Marxism's non-Marxist {{critics also}} raised methodological objections. Against Elster and the {{rational}} choice Marxists, Carver argued that methodological individualism {{was not the}} only form of valid explanation in the social sciences, that <b>functionalism</b> in the absence of micro-foundations could remain a convincing and fruitful mode of inquiry, and that rational choice and game theory were far from being universally accepted as sound or useful ways of modelling social institutions and processes.|$|E
25|$|The {{break from}} the {{classical}} mode came first with the Gothic revival, then the development of modernism during the 19th century. The Bauhaus promoted pure <b>functionalism,</b> stripped of superfluous ornament, and that {{has become one of}} the defining characteristics of modern architecture. There are some exceptions. Postmodernism introduced an ironic use of the orders as a cultural reference, divorced from the strict rules of composition. On the other hand, a few practitioners e.g. Quinlan Terry and Stuart Martin still work in a traditional classical idiom.|$|E
