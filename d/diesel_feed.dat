30|$|The {{conventional}} HDS {{process is}} usually conducted over sulfided CoMo/γ-Al 2 O 3 or NiMo/γ-Al 2 O 3 catalysts. A variety of metal contents, promoters, support properties, etc., {{have been studied}} and used {{for the development of}} versatile deep HDS catalyst system. Despite their robust nature, conventional catalysts, however, do not have sufficient activity to desulfurize <b>diesel</b> <b>feed</b> streams to ultra-low sulfur levels under normal operating conditions. They require severe operating conditions such as high temperature, low space velocity and high hydrogen partial pressure. Such severe processing conditions generally lead to rapid catalyst deactivation, shorter cycle lengths and reduced throughput.|$|E
40|$|International audienceTo produce ultra low-sulfur {{gasoline}} {{and meet the}} new regulations, {{the improvement of the}} HDS reaction by the removal of inhibitors, like nitrogen-containing compounds (N-compounds) commonly found in middle distillates used for <b>diesel</b> <b>feed,</b> could be worth considering. Liquid–liquid extraction using 1 -butyl- 3 -methyl-imidazolium chloride (BMIm+Cl−) was found to be a very promising approach for the removal of neutral N-compounds with high selectivity towards sulfur. BMIm+Cl− was first evaluated using synthetic solution with dibenzothiophene and carbazole as model compounds, and a high selectivity for N-compounds was found. In order to explain the observed selectivity, the extraction of heterocyclic aromatic compounds from a hydrocarbon mixture by BMIm+Cl− was studied as the function of the toluene/n-dodecane ratio. The extraction of sulfur-containing compounds and basic N-compounds decreased when the mass fraction of toluene increased, whereas the extraction of proton donor N-compounds was found to be almost independent of the mass fraction of toluene. We thus assumed that the selective extraction of indole and carbazole by BMIm+Cl− could be explained both by electron pair acceptor properties of the imidazolium ring and by the binding of the hydrogen-donor group with chloride anion of the RTIL. BMIm+Cl− was then evaluated using straight-run <b>diesel</b> <b>feed,</b> containing 13400 ppm S and 105 ppm N. An extraction of up to 50 % of the N-compounds was obtained in one step, whereas the sulfur concentration reduction was only 5 %. The selectivity of the extraction process towards heterocyclic aromatic compounds and polyaromatic compounds using BMIm+Cl− was further emphasized by two-dimensional GC-MS analysis of the extracted compounds...|$|E

Recently, we have shown that chloride-based ionic liquids (ILs) can selectively extract N-compounds from straight-run diesel feeds. However, the measurable solubility of ILs in hydrocarbon fuel is not a desired outcome of the process. Thus, the covalent binding of ILs moieties on polymers was studied. Starting from Merrifield resin, three resins were prepared with imidazolium, pyridinium, and triethylammonium chloride functionality.

Gas-phase activation {{was carried out in}} 1 or 20 bar H 2 /H 2 S(10 %), whereas liquid-phase activation comprised sulfidation in a model <b>diesel</b> <b>feed,</b> spiked with dimethyldisulfide and 20 bar H 2. Full sulfidation of calcined precursors was difficult to achieve (type I), as shown by XPS and EXAFS. CA addition slowed the sulfidation of cobalt and molybdenum in 1 bar H 2 /H 2 S compared to a catalyst with no additives, but it substantially increased sulfidation rates in 20 bar H 2 /H 2 S. This can be attributed to reduced support interactions and enhanced reducibility of molybdenum. Liquid-phase sulfidation was initiated by a release of H 2 S at ∼ 250 °C due to decomposition of the spiking agent dimethyldisulfide. The resulting active phase was composed of predominantly MoS 2 single-layers, whereas stacked layers formed after gas-phase activation. Catalytic activity in thiophene and DBT HDS mainly depended on the number of promoted sites. Catalysts prepared with CA had the highest degree of promotion and were most active in thiophene and DBT HDS, whereas the catalyst with PA performed best in gas-oil HDS due to increased stability...|$|E

40|$|International @ RAFFINAGE+DSA:CGE:PAFInternational audienceHydrodesulfurization (HDS) {{is a major}} {{process of}} {{petroleum}} refining destined to the removal of sulphur compounds from fuels, {{in order to satisfy}} environmental concerns. At the present day, the legislation for gasoline and diesel admits 10 ppm of sulphur. HDS catalysts are composed by Ni or Co promoted molybdenum sulfide phases dispersed in an alumina support with high specific surface, preferentially {{in the form of the}} so-called CoMoS phase. In the industrial process, these catalysts can perform during an average of 2 years, depending on the type of feed used. During the cycle of a HDS process, deactivation of the catalyst is attributed to three main causes: coke deposition (inducing both pore plugging and catalytic site blocking), metals deposition and segregation of the active phase. In the industrial units, to keep necessary performance, the catalyst deactivation is compensated by an increase in temperature. The aim of our work is to study the effect of coking and active phase changes on the deactivation of the HDS catalyst (of CoMo/Al 2 O 3 type) applied to the HDS of a <b>diesel</b> <b>feed.</b> In order to understand these phenomena, the aging of the catalyst must be accelerated; in order to reproduce the characteristics observed in a 6 months to 2 years run on a much shorter time scale. The typical operating conditions of a HDS process on a straight-run gasoil (SRGO) are 340 °C, 40 bar and a ratio H 2 /GO of 250 Nl/l; the accelerated aging tests must be performed under more severe but still realistic conditions. Using a commercial CoMo/Al 2 O 3 catalyst, different series of aging tests have been performed by increasing the temperature (up to 390 °C), limiting the hydrogen supply (from 250 to 25 Nl/l), introducing nitrogen and aromatic inhibitors in the feedstock or using mixed feedstocks (SRGO and SRGO/LCO). After every aging test, the hydrotreated diesel samples and the aged catalysts have been recovered for further analysis of catalyst texture, active phase and coke structure. Aging tests were performed with durations between 90 and 250 hours, reaching a coke amount of 8 %wt and a total volume of pores loss up to 30 %.

30|$|Biodiesel {{seems to}} be a {{realistic}} fuel for future; it has become more attractive recently because of its environmental benefits. Biodiesel is an environmentally friendly fuel {{that can be used in}} any diesel engine without modification [1]. Recently, heterogeneous catalysts derived from renewable materials, such as oyster shell [2], egg shell [3], mud crab shell [4], and mollusk shells [5] have been employed for conversion of oils to biodiesel. Previously, those catalysts source were generally considered as waste. Normally, disposal of these waste materials from seafood processing are an economic or environmental problem for entrepreneurs and local governments. However, biodiesel production catalysts prepared from these “wastes” are a promising “green” technology. Hydroxyapatite the main component of bones and teeth, attracts considerable interests in many areas because of acid–base properties, ion-exchange ability, and adsorption capacity [6]. Thus, bone waste of animal which contain hydroxyapatite (HA) can also be used as raw material to develop heterogeneous green catalysts for biodiesel production. HA is an efficient solid base catalyst used for many reactions such as the Michael addition [7] and the reaction of ring opening [8]. Bone does have 65 – 70  % hydroxyapatite and 30 – 35  % organic compounds (on a dry weight basis) [9]. Recently, Obadiah et al. worked on the biodiesel production from palm oil using calcined waste animal bone as catalyst. The biodiesel yield was 96.78  % under optimal reaction conditions of 20  wt% of catalysts, 1 : 18 oil to methanol ratio, 200  rpm of stirring of reactants and at a temperature of 65  °C [10]. Desirable feedstock characteristics include adaptability to local growing conditions, regional availability, high oil content, favorable FA composition, compatibility with existing farm practices, low agricultural inputs, definable growing season, uniform seed maturation rates, markets for byproducts, compatibility with fallow lands, and rotational adaptability with commodity crops [11]. Biodiesel prepared from feedstocks that meet all or most of these criteria hold the greatest promise as alternatives to mineral <b>diesel.</b> <b>Feed</b> stocks of interest in the current study included peanut and rapeseed oils. The peanut or groundnut belongs to the Fabaceae family and China and India represent 56  % of the world’s cultivated area. The percentage of oleic acid in traditional peanut oil ranges from 41 to 67  %, whereas high-oleic cultivars contain close to 80  % of this constituent [12]. Rapeseed is now second largest oilseed crop after soybean and the third largest vegetable oil and characterized by high level of erucic acid which may cause serious damage to heart and lever [13].|$|E

The values of Monod kinetic parameters namely, μ max, maximum specific growth rate and Ks, saturation constant of the microbial growth and Yield coefficient of surfactant have been measured to be 0. 096 h- 1, 71 mg/L, and 17 μmol/g dry cell weights respectively by conducting batch type experiments. A continuous chemostat was studied using different hydrodynamic and physico-chemical parameters like dilution rate, initial concentration of organo-sulfur compounds in diesel, stirring rate and aeration rate. Surfactant part was characterized by determination of surface tension (Ring method), E 24, TLC, HPLC and GC-MS. The interfacial tension of the supernatant fermented by Rhodococcus sp decreased from 28 dynes/cm to 9 dynes/cm. The surface tension of aqueous nutrient phase and diesel was observed to decrease from 71 dynes/cm to 30 dynes/cm and to 20 dynes/cm from 30 dynes/cm respectively. Values of emulsification index (E 24) were determined to vary from 18 to 58 over the growth period of 2 to 48 hours in the chemostat. The critical miceller concentration was found to be 200 mg/L. The simulated data have been compared with the experimental ones to validate the model...|$|R
40|$|Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) is a {{promising}} technology for producing electricity cleanly and efficiently. This {{type of fuel}} cell is a high temperature fuel cell operating around 1000 °C for state-of-the-art SOFC. An advantage of the high temperature {{is the possibility of}} combined heat and power generation which would even further increase the efficiency of this technology. However, due to high operating temperatures, there are problems associated with the development and commercialization of SOFC, such as requirement of high temperature gas seals, and relatively poor long-term stability. The current trend in SOFC development is therefore to reduce the operating temperature of the cell to the range 600 - 800 °C. However, this requires developing new cell designs and materials since decreasing the operating temperature increases the ohmic overpotential due to higher ionic diffusion resistance in the electrolyte, thereby reducing electrochemical performance. For intermediate temperature SOFC, SDC is {{a promising}} electrolyte material to reduce the ohmic overpotential. The present research focused on developing a lD model of SDC based SOFC validated for a number of feed gas compositions, from humidified H 2, mixture of CO and C 02, to several syngas compositions (typical of diesel syngas, biomass syngas and pre-reformed natural gas). The model was developed for an anode supported cell. Few parameters were used as free fit parameters: essentially structural parameters, such as porosity and tortuosity, as well as kinetic parameters for H 1 and CO electrochemical reactions. In most cases, the simulated results (polarization curve) fitted well the experimental data. It was seen that the performance of CO/C 02 system is considerably lower than the H 2 /H 20 system. The model results also allowed to access variables' profiles that would not be accessible experimentally, such species composition profile and local current density along the anode. In particular, it was observed that most the electrochemical reaction occurred within 10 μm away from the anode/ electro I yte interface. In the literature, the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction is considered to occur only over Ni, but the present work demonstrated that SDC is active toward the WGS reaction. Therefore, a kinetic study was carried out to determine a rate expression for the WGS reaction. This rate expression was then incorporated into the SOFC model. The results indicated that inclusion of the WGS reaction on SDC has minor or negligible effect in most situations, except in the case of CO mole fraction for the <b>diesel</b> syngas <b>feed</b> at higher cell voltage. The reason was that the composition of diesel syngas was such that there was a higher driving force for the WGS reaction to proceed in the reverse WGS direction. When the water content is high enough, {{as in the case of}} higher current densities, the form of the derived rate expression for the WGS on SDC makes the value of this rate very small. The rate expression was derived using relatively small amounts of water because of experimental limitation and therefore, the form of this rate needs to be revisited by considering higher amount of water...|$|R
40|$|Emissions to air {{and water}} are related to both soil and plant {{processes}} and production-related choices regarding fertilisation, feeding strategy, etc. made by farmers. The main purpose of this thesis was to study {{the environmental impacts of}} agricultural production by developing simulation models describing the physical flows of farm production for different scenarios. The SALSA models (Systems Analysis for Sustainable Agriculture) were constructed and case studies carried out on arable, pig meat and milk/meat production. These environmental systems analyses encompassed the entire process from production of input materials (fertilisers, fuel, electricity, etc.) via on-farm processes (machine operations, crop growth, soil/plant emissions, emissions from animals and manure storage, etc.) until products were ready at the farm gate. Simulation outputs in terms of land use and environmental impacts for eutrophication, acidification, global warming potential and primary energy use were evaluated using Life Cycle Assessment methodology. A combined model was also constructed to reflect the interplay between the decision-making farmer and arable production. This was accomplished by linking SALSA to a decision model. The SALSA models proved to be valuable tools in studying the environmental impacts of the processes involved. Since the environmental impacts and energy use values obtained by simulations were divided by the amount of crops, milk, meat, etc. produced, yield had a major influence on the outcome. Nitrogen use was a key factor affecting both yield and all environmental categories. Another important factor was choice of manure management system, where large amounts of ammonia could be emitted, contributing to eutrophication and acidification. There were considerable differences in the environmental effects of crops and feed ingredients. The pig growth study showed that by choosing feedstuffs with a low environmental impact during production, some of the environmental burdens could be avoided. Feed produced on-farm in combination with synthetic amino acids was environmentally favourable for pig production. Simulations of the milk/meat production system indicated that high-level milk production complemented with meat production from a suckler herd gave slightly lower environmental impacts than low-level milk production due to the higher milk production efficiency from more concentrates in the feed. Mineral fertiliser production, fuel for machinery operations and drying were significant energy uses in crop production. In livestock production, electricity for operation of buildings and milking equipment, long-distance shipping of soybean meal, production of plastic silage wrapping and <b>diesel</b> fuel for <b>feeding</b> were significant energy uses. Emissions contributing to global warming potential originated mainly from enteric fermentation in animals and nitrous oxide emissions from soils and recipient waters. Development of the combined simulation model demonstrated the possibility of operationally integrating research from social sciences and natural sciences. The results showed the importance of society supporting more environmentally friendly production in improving sustainability in agriculture...|$|R
