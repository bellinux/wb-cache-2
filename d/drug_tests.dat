5|$|In late 2005, two NHL {{players who}} had been listed as {{potential}} Olympians failed <b>drug</b> <b>tests</b> administered by the WADA. American Bryan Berard, who had competed in the 1998 Winter Olympics, tested positive for 19-Norandrosterone. Canadian José Théodore failed a drug test because he was taking Propecia, a hair loss medication that contains the non-performance-enhancing drug Finasteride. Both players received two-year bans from international competition, although neither had made their team's final roster.|$|E
5|$|The IIHF {{follows the}} World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) {{regulations}} on performance-enhancing drugs. The IIHF maintains a Registered Testing Pool, {{a list of}} top players who are subjected to random in-competition and out-of-competition <b>drug</b> <b>tests.</b> According to the WADA, a positive in-competition test results in disqualification of the player and a suspension that varies {{based on the number}} of offences. When a player tests positive, the rest of their team is subjected to testing; another positive test can result in a disqualification of the entire team. In 2001, the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) pushed for American NHL players who were potential Olympians to be subject to random <b>drug</b> <b>tests.</b> The USOC requires all Olympic-bound athletes to be randomly tested by the United States Anti-Doping Agency, but had exempted NHL players in 1998. The NHL preferred a more uniform method, in which all players would undergo the same number of tests from the WADA. An agreement was reached that the WADA would start testing players after the NHL playoffs were finished.|$|E

5|$|Based on the {{analysis}} of rat and human urine by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, mephedrone {{is thought to be}} metabolised by three phase 1 pathways. It can be demethylated to the primary amine (producing compounds 2, 3 and 5), the ketone group can be reduced (producing 3) or the tolyl group can be oxidised (producing 6). Both 5 and 6 are thought to be further metabolised by conjugation to the glucuronide and sulfate derivatives. Knowledge of the primary routes of metabolism should allow the intake of mephedrone to be confirmed by <b>drug</b> <b>tests,</b> as well as more accurate determination of the causes of side effects and potential for toxicity.|$|E

5|$|New York's 1988 season {{got off to}} a {{turbulent}} start due an offseason scandal involving Taylor. Taylor had abused cocaine, violating the NFL's substance abuse policy and was suspended for the first four games of the season. Taylor's over-the-edge lifestyle was becoming an increasing concern for fans and team officials. After his return, however, Taylor recorded 15.5 sacks in 12 games. The intense worry and scrutiny would prove to be for naught as {{for the rest of his}} career Taylor would pass his <b>drug</b> <b>tests.</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies {{economic issues}} posed by illicit <b>drug</b> <b>testing.</b> The firm 2 ̆ 7 s decision {{to adopt a}} <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> program is analyzed {{in the context of}} a matching model. Essay one studies the labor market effects of preemployment <b>drug</b> <b>testing.</b> While <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> enhances productive efficiency, many of these welfare gains are dissipated by a labor market externality. <b>Drug</b> <b>testing</b> also benefits drug-free workers at the expense of drug users. Low turnover rates, high injury rates, the use of job training, and large workforces all increase the likelihood that the firm adopts a preemployment <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> program. Essay two considers the use of “for cause” <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> in conjunction with preemployment testing. Large firms and firms with high injury rates test with greater intensity than others. As the firm becomes larger, it is relatively more likely to adopt a preemployment testing program than a “for cause” policy. Essay three studies the pattern of adoption of preemployment <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> over time. The early adoption of <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> programs is positively related to factors influencing their profitability. ...|$|R

50|$|Soon, {{controversy}} over <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> would cause powerlifting to splinter into multiple federations. In 1981, the American Drug Free Powerlifting Association (ADFPA), led by Brother Bennett, {{became the first}} federation {{to break away from}} the USPF, citing the need to implement effective <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> in the sport. Meanwhile, the IPF was moving towards adopting <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> at international meets, and requiring member nations to implement <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> at national meets as well. In 1982, <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> was introduced to the IPF men's international championship, although the USPF championships that year did not have <b>drug</b> <b>testing.</b> The IPF's push for <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> was resisted by some American lifters, and in 1982 Larry Pacifico and Ernie Frantz founded the American Powerlifting Federation (APF), which advertised its categorical opposition to all <b>drug</b> <b>testing.</b> In 1987 the American Powerlifting Association (APA) and World Powerlifting Alliance were formed by Scott Taylor. The APA and WPA offer both <b>drug</b> <b>tested</b> and non-tested categories in most of their competitions. Ultimately, the USPF failed to conform to IPF demands, and was expelled from the international body in 1997, with the ADFPA, now named USA Powerlifting (USAPL), taking its place.|$|R

5|$|Amphetamine is {{frequently}} measured in urine or blood {{as part of}} a drug test for sports, employment, poisoning diagnostics, and forensics. Techniques such as immunoassay, which is {{the most common form of}} amphetamine test, may cross-react with a number of sympathomimetic drugs. Chromatographic methods specific for amphetamine are employed to prevent false positive results. Chiral separation techniques may be employed to help distinguish the source of the drug, whether prescription amphetamine, prescription amphetamine prodrugs, (e.g., selegiline), over-the-counter drug products that contain levomethamphetamine, or illicitly obtained substituted amphetamines. Several prescription drugs produce amphetamine as a metabolite, including benzphetamine, clobenzorex, famprofazone, fenproporex, lisdexamfetamine, mesocarb, methamphetamine, prenylamine, and selegiline, among others. These compounds may produce positive results for amphetamine on <b>drug</b> <b>tests.</b> Amphetamine is generally only detectable by a standard drug test for approximately 24hours, although a high dose may be detectable for days.|$|E

He joined the Massachusetts Army National Guard when he was 19, receiving his basic training at Fort Dix, New Jersey, and attending Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) classes at the campus of Northeastern University. He was trained in infantry, quartermaster, and airborne duties, and in 1994 he joined the Judge Advocate General's Corps (JAG). He {{was active in the}} Guard for 35 years rising to the rank of colonel. As the Army National Guard's head defense attorney in New England, Brown defended Guard members who had disciplinary difficulties such as positive <b>drug</b> <b>tests,</b> and provided estate planning and real estate advice to those who were about to deploy to war zones.

40|$|The {{intrusive}} {{nature of}} <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> implicates the concern over a person 2 ̆ 7 s right to privacy. Currently, Congress has proposed legislation which would establish minimum <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> requirements in professional sports. This legislation is {{a reaction to}} suspicions and investigations surrounding Major League Baseball players {{and the use of}} performance enhancing drugs. Federally mandated <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> would raise constitutional issues regarding the players 2 ̆ 7 rights against mandatory <b>drug</b> <b>testing.</b> These concerns could be avoided if <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> policies are implemented through a collective bargaining agreement, negotiated and agreed upon between the leagues and their players associations. Thus, as previously asserted, collective bargaining provides the ideal forum for implementing performance-enhancing <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> policies in professional sports. Part II of this article explores the evolution and nature of professional sports in America and analyzes why the public is demanding that professional athletes be submitted to performance-enhancing <b>drug</b> <b>testing.</b> 2 ̆ 2 Part III of the article scrutinizes the nature of <b>drug</b> <b>testing,</b> examines the associated onstitutional concerns, and recognizes current <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> policies in professional sports. Part IV of the article provides an overview of collective bargaining agreements and the use of arbitration. Then, Part V explains why collective bargaining is the appropriate forum for implementing performance-enhancing <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> policies in professional sports.

5|$|On the July 7 {{episode of}} SmackDown, it was {{announced}} that Lesnar would be facing Randy Orton at SummerSlam, who himself had just returned to WWE from injury. Two days later on July 9, WWE allowed Lesnar to have a one-off fight for UFC 200. Lesnar failed two of his <b>drug</b> <b>tests</b> for this fight, but he was not suspended by WWE because he is not a full-time performer. On July 19 at the 2016 WWE draft, Lesnar was the #5 draft pick for the Raw brand. Reports claimed that he would have been #1 had he not failed his UFC <b>drug</b> <b>tests.</b> Orton was drafted to SmackDown, thus making their match an interbrand match, while WWE billed their face-off as a match fifteen years in the making. Along with Heyman, Lesnar made his return to Raw on August 1 (his first appearance on WWE programming since WrestleMania 32), but during his segment Orton appeared and attacked Lesnar with an RKO. Lesnar then attacked Orton during his match the following night on SmackDown Live, performing an F-5 on Orton. At SummerSlam on August 21, Lesnar defeated Orton by technical knockout, leaving Orton with a forehead wound which required ten staples. Much to Shane McMahon's dismay, Lesnar would later attack Shane with an F-5. The end made many people believe Lesnar had gone off script due to the severity of Orton's head wound. Lesnar was later storyline fined $500 for delivering an F-5 to SmackDown Commissioner Shane McMahon and his assault on Orton. On September 24 at a house show in Chicago, Illinois, Lesnar defeated Orton in a no-disqualification rematch, with the match being billed as a Suplex City death match.|$|E

This paper aims to address this matter by presenting the findings of a survey of construction apprentices and their attitudes to workplace <b>drug</b> <b>testing.</b> The results indicate that under some circumstances there is approval for tests; testing with advance warning is preferred to random testing. In addition, the practice of workplace <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> in a company would not deter most respondents from applying for a position there. However, attitudes towards most aspects of <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> - such as the need for random testing, the right of employers to <b>test</b> for <b>drugs,</b> and infringement of personal rights - are characterised by extreme variability.

5|$|The six-man {{match at}} SummerSlam was {{originally}} {{supposed to be}} a mixed tag-team match between the team of Tatanka and Sherri Martel and the team of Bam Bam Bigelow and Luna Vachon. However, Luna broke her arm and Sherri left the WWF in July 1993, however, forcing the WWF to change the match. Two reasons have been given for Sherri's departure: her decision to enroll in cosmetology school and failed <b>drug</b> <b>tests.</b> As a result, Tatanka teamed with The Smoking Gunns and Bigelow teamed with The Headshrinkers. The Gunns and Headshrinkers were rivals in the tag team division but had no real storyline.

5|$|Athletes have {{historically}} been willing to take legal and health risks to improve their performance, with some even stating their willingness to risk their lives, as exemplified by research by Mirkin, Goldman and Connor in researching attitudes to the so-called Goldman dilemma. To prevent use of performance-enhancing substances, athletes must submit to <b>drug</b> <b>tests</b> that are conducted {{both in and out}} of competition by anti-doping officials or accredited medical staff. Penalized athletes are susceptible to higher testing upon return to competition. Athletes found to have taken substances on the World Anti-Doping Agency's banned list receive sanctions and may be banned from competition for a period of time that corresponds to the seriousness of the infraction. However, the use of substances not on the prohibited list may also result in sanctions if the substance is deemed similar to a banned substance in either composition or effect. Athletes may also be sanctioned for missing tests, seeking to avoid testing or tampering with results, refusing to submit to testing, through circumstantial evidence, or confession of use.|$|E

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to {{determine}} if a <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> program could impact or change student drug use at the secondary education level. Secondary purposes were to 1) assess the perceptions of secondary education students toward licit and illicit drugs, drug use, and the newly implemented <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> program, and 2) to examine why drug use may continue even after a <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> program has been implemented. Data was collected through the use of questionnaires, discussion groups, and one-on-one interviews. Examination of the questionnaire data indicated that student drug use was not substantially deterred by the newly implemented <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> program over a three to four month time period. Also, students' perceptions of the newly implemented <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> program were mainly that of disagreement. Students commented that they felt the <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> policy was implemented to "catch them" using drugs rather than "help them" with a possible drug addiction. One of the main reasons that the <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> program did not have a great deterrent effect on student drug use, as suggested by the students, was that the odds were not high enough that they would be selected to be <b>drug</b> <b>tested.</b> In some instances, <b>drug</b> <b>testing</b> was not proving to be a deterrent to drug use, but rather a deterrent to participation in school activities.
