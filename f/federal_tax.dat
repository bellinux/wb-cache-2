5|$|Until 1976, <b>federal</b> <b>tax</b> {{incentives}} {{were virtually}} non-existent for {{buildings on the}} National Register. Before 1976 the <b>federal</b> <b>tax</b> code favored new construction rather than the reuse of existing, sometimes historical, structures. In 1976, the tax code was altered to provide tax incentives that promote preservation of income-producing historic properties. The National Park Service was given the responsibility to ensure that only rehabilitations that preserved the historic character of a building would qualify for <b>federal</b> <b>tax</b> incentives. A qualifying rehabilitation is one that the NPS deems consistent with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. Properties and sites listed in the Register, {{as well as those}} located in and contributing to the period of significance of National Register Historic Districts, became eligible for the <b>federal</b> <b>tax</b> benefits.|$|E

5|$|A key {{question}} surrounding the FairTax {{is whether the}} tax {{has the ability to}} be revenue-neutral; that is, whether the tax would result in an increase or reduction in overall <b>federal</b> <b>tax</b> revenues. Economists, advisory groups, and political advocacy groups disagree about the tax rate required for the FairTax to be truly revenue-neutral. Various analysts use different assumptions, time-frames, and methods resulting in dramatically different tax rates making direct comparison among the studies difficult. The choice between static or dynamic scoring further complicates any estimate of revenue-neutral rates.|$|E
5|$|Adams also {{rebuilt the}} Navy, adding six fast, {{powerful}} frigates, {{most notably the}} USS Constitution.

The incidence of corporate income tax has {{been a matter of}} considerable ongoing controversy for decades. State and local taxes vary widely, but are generally less progressive than <b>federal</b> <b>taxes</b> as they rely heavily on broadly borne regressive sales and property taxes that yield less volatile revenue streams, though their consideration does not eliminate the progressive nature of overall taxation.|$|R
5|$|The Commission {{recommended}} {{that the federal government}} assume responsibility for financing social programs such as old-age pensions and unemployment insurance. It also argued that Ottawa should establish equity among provinces and that redistribution of <b>federal</b> <b>tax</b> revenues should be based on need, an idea that became central to Macdonald's thinking about federal-provincial relations. Among other things, the Commission called on the Macdonald government to continue paving roads; to undertake a program of rural electrification to keep young people on family farms; and, to establish a professional civil service that would defend Nova Scotia's interests against federal bureaucrats in Ottawa.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of his {{business}} career, Romney and his wife had a net worth of between $190 and $250million, including their retirement account, worth between $20 and $100million. Most of that wealth has been held in blind trusts since 2003, some of it offshore. An additional blind trust, valued at $100million in 2012, exists in the name of their children. In 2010, Romney and his wife received about $22million in income, almost all of it from investments such as dividends, capital gains, and carried interest; and they paid about $3million in federal income taxes, for an effective tax rate of 14percent. For the years 1990–2010, their effective <b>federal</b> <b>tax</b> rates were above 13percent with an average rate of about 20percent.|$|E
5|$|Chicago Landmark is a {{designation}} of the Mayor of Chicago and the Chicago City Council for historic buildings and other sites in Chicago, Illinois, United States.

Once a site is designated as a landmark, it {{is subject to the}} Chicago Landmarks Ordinance, which requires that any alterations beyond routine maintenance, up to and including demolition, must have their permit reviewed by the Landmarks Commission. Many Chicago Landmarks are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places, providing <b>federal</b> <b>tax</b> support for preservation, and some are further designated National Historic Landmarks, providing additional federal oversight.|$|E

5|$|During the transition, many {{or most of}} the {{employees}} of the IRS (105,978 in 2005) would face loss of employment. The Beacon Hill Institute estimate is that the federal government would be able to cut $8 billion from the IRS budget of $11.01 billion (in 2007), reducing the size of <b>federal</b> <b>tax</b> administration by 73%. In addition, income tax preparers (many seasonal), tax lawyers, tax compliance staff in medium-to-large businesses, and software companies which sell tax preparation software could face significant drops, changes, or loss of employment. The bill would maintain the IRS for three years after implementation before completely decommissioning the agency, providing employees time to find other employment.|$|E
5|$|Just {{as there}} is a need for tax shifting, there is also a need for subsidy shifting. Subsidies are not an {{inherently}} bad thing as many technologies and industries emerged through government subsidy schemes. The Stern Review explains that of 20 key innovations from the past 30years, only one of the 14 was funded entirely by the private sector and nine were totally publicly funded. In terms of specific examples, the Internet was the result of publicly funded links among computers in government laboratories and research institutes. And the combination of the <b>federal</b> <b>tax</b> deduction and a robust state tax deduction in California helped to create the modern wind power industry.|$|E
5|$|Other {{aspects of}} the excise law also caused concern. The law {{required}} all stills to be registered, and those cited for failure to pay the tax had to appear in distant Federal, rather than local courts. The only Federal courthouse was in Philadelphia, some 300 {{miles away from the}} small frontier settlement of Pittsburgh. From the beginning, the Federal government had little success in collecting the whiskey tax along the frontier. Many small western distillers simply refused to pay the tax. Federal revenue officers and local residents who assisted them bore the brunt of the protester's ire. Tax rebels harassed several whiskey tax collectors and threatened or beat those who offered them office space or housing. As a result, many western counties never had a resident <b>Federal</b> <b>tax</b> official.|$|E

5|$|Other {{candidates}} in the Democratic field included sitting lieutenant governor Thelma Stovall, Terry McBrayer (the choice of sitting governor Julian Carroll), congressman Carroll Hubbard, state auditor George Adkins, and Louisville mayor Harvey Sloane. Initially the leading candidate, Stovall was hampered during the campaign by ill health. During the campaign, Brown was attacked by McBrayer for refusing to release his <b>federal</b> <b>tax</b> returns. McBrayer also claimed that Brown had not voted in a Democratic primary since 1975, a charge validated by public voting records. Nevertheless, Brown won the primary {{by a margin of}} 25,000 votes. The race was so close that Sloane, Brown's closest competitor, refused to concede for two days. Brown defeated former Republican governor Louie B. Nunn in the 1979 general election by a vote of 554,083 to 376,809.|$|E
5|$|The FairTax is a {{national}} tax, but can be administered by the states rather than a federal agency, which may have a bearing on compliance as the states' own agencies could monitor and audit businesses within that state. The 0.25% retained by the states amounts to $5 billion the states would have available for enforcement and administration. For example, California should receive over $500 million for enforcement and administration, {{which is more than}} the $327 million budget for the state's sales and excise taxes. Because the federal money paid to the states would be a percentage of the total revenue collected, John Linder claims the states would have an incentive to maximize collections. Proponents believe that states that choose to conform to the <b>federal</b> <b>tax</b> base would have advantages in enforcement, information sharing, and clear interstate revenue allocation rules. A study by the Beacon Hill Institute concluded that, on average, states could more than halve their sales tax rates and that state economies would benefit greatly from adopting a state-level FairTax.|$|E
5|$|The Swiss Federal budget had a size of 62.8 billion Swiss francs in 2010, {{which is}} an {{equivalent}} 11.35% of the country's GDP in that year; however, the regional (canton) budgets and the budgets of the municipalities are not counted {{as part of the}} federal budget and the total rate of government spending is closer to 33.8% of GDP.
