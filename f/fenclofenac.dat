50|$|<b>Fenclofenac</b> is a nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID) previously used in rheumatism. It has mild immunosuppressive {{effects and}} may displace thyroid hormone from its binding protein. It {{can also cause}} lichen planus.|$|E
40|$|A six month single-blind, {{randomized}} parallel group study {{comparing the}} effects of <b>fenclofenac</b> and diclofenac in 63 patients with rheumatoid arthritis is described. Both treatments produced improve-ments in clinical measurements, with a significant between-treatment effect in favour of <b>fenclofenac</b> for overall pain, night pain and duration of morning stiffness. Both treatments produced a decrease in IgM and the <b>fenclofenac</b> group produced decreases in plasma viscosity and ESR, the latter showing a significant between-treatment effect in favour of <b>fenclofenac.</b> No clinically significant changes in routine haematology and biochemistry were noted. Unwanted effects leading to with-drawal of therapy were reported by five patients in the <b>fenclofenac</b> group and three patients in the diclofenac group. Two patients in the <b>fenclofenac</b> group {{and one in the}} diclofenac group were withdrawn for reasons unrelated to therapy. In the diclofenac group two and four patients were withdrawn for clinical deterioration and inadequate effect respectively. KEY WORDS: Rheumatoid arthritis; Fenclofenac; Diclofenac. <b>FENCLOFENAC</b> and diclofenac belong to the phenylacetic acid group of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and both have been shown to provide good symptomatic relief {{in a wide range of}} studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (1, 2).

40|$|Response to non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) is {{not usually}} assessed {{on the basis of}} concentration measurements: identification of a concentration-effect relationship has proved difficult to achieve. Dose and concentration-effect relationships of <b>fenclofenac</b> have been determined in a group of 18 patients with rheumatoid arthritis at three dose levels (600, 1200 and 1800 mg day- 1). The study was double-blind and treatments were randomised according to a Latin square design. A multiple linear regression technique (GLIM) was used in the analysis. The best model to describe the change in effect in terms of dose and concentration incorporated an average slope and an individual subject intercept for each effect measurement. On average, an improvement in grip strength of 20 mm Hg could be obtained with an increase in <b>fenclofenac</b> (trough) concentration of 100 micrograms ml- 1...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY This {{study has}} {{set out to}} {{establish}} whether <b>fenclofenac</b> has an antirheumatic effect {{in addition to its}} anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity. The results show that {{during the course of a}} 6 -month study the drug improved clinical parameters, including the articular index, early morning stiffness, ring sizes, and grip strength, and produced changes in laboratory measurements such as the levels of C-reactive protein, IgG, and rheumatoid factor. A clear distinction has been made in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis between those drugs which have anti-inflammatory/analgesic properties and a second group of drugs which have actions on the rheumatoid process itself. This latter group includes drugs such as D-penicillamine, gold, levamisole, azathioprine, and cyclophosphamide. These drugs interfere with the disease process as judged by clinical remission, a fall in erythrocyte sedimen-tation rate (ESR), a decline in C-reactive protei...|$|E
