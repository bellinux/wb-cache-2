50|$|The IEC {{was created}} only {{shortly before the}} 2013 elections, and had only 8-months to prepare for it. It {{introduced}} pre-printed ballot cards designed to conform to international standards. Prior to this, voters needed to write down their preferred candidate’s names. This meant illiterate voters could not vote in secret, as they had to ask voting staff to write down their vote, risking voting fraud. The new ballots also had enhanced security features to help ensure legitimacy. The IEC also introduced indelible ink, {{and for the first}} time all <b>election</b> <b>staff,</b> 32,000 at this election, were trained.

Increased state costs would be partially offset by savings resulting from reductions in compensation to affected UC officials.

50|$|The Government of Alberta {{commissioned}} four Chief Electoral Officers to help run the election. The election {{proved to}} be a logistical challenge as no similar election had ever been conducted on a worldwide scale.

Van Buren was in charge of Canada, United States and Alaska, Newfoundland, Bermuda, Nassau and Jamaica. L.P. Danis was the Chief Returning Officer for France, Belgium and Holland. The jobs of the Chief Electoral Officers included finding out where Albertans were stationed, setting up polling stations, and overseeing collection of ballots. In some cases polling stations were set up directly in the trenches causing delays to the election as <b>election</b> <b>staff</b> came under hostile fire.|$|E

40|$|In {{terms of}} ‘free and fair ’ the Guatemalan {{first and second}} round of {{elections}} in November and December 2003 were probably the best in 60 years. The paper discusses the key roles played by the international community, Guatemalan <b>election</b> <b>staff</b> and domestic observers in overcoming threats to the process. The elections are viewed within the overall political, social and economic context of Guatemala. If rhetoric were bankable, Oscar Berger, would be beginning his presidency with a very favourable balance. Good appointments to eco-nomic portfolios join a few symbolically important gestures to indigenous and human rights communities. Berger has committed his government to implementation of the 1996 Peace Accord’s political, economic and cul-tural objectives. However, formidable obstacles stand in his path. He inherits an empty treasury from his pred-ecessor Alfonso Portillo and confronts a public service environment of endemic corruption. His political coalition Gran Alianza Nacional (GANA) occupies a minority position in the legislature. Traditional discrimination against the generally impoverished Maya is changing, but too slowly to satisfy the indigenous population and the inter-national community. The paper forecasts that Berger’s administration {{will be unable to}} substantially correct sys-temic weaknesses and cultural prejudice, but may lay the foundations for more lasting change by successor gov-ernments.
