5|$|Giovanni Battista Grassi, {{professor}} of Comparative Anatomy at Rome University, showed that human malaria {{could only be}} transmitted by Anopheles (Greek anofelís: good-for-nothing) mosquitoes. Grassi along with coworkers Amico Bignami, Giuseppe Bastianelli and Ettore Marchiafava announced at the session of the Accademia dei Lincei on 4 December 1898 that a healthy man in a non-malarial zone <b>had</b> <b>contracted</b> tertian malaria after being bitten by an experimentally infected Anopheles claviger specimen.|$|E

The guest judge slot was axed for the London auditions, but continued with Perry judging in Dublin, Lott in Cardiff and Scherzinger at the auditions in Manchester. Cole was unable to attend the Manchester auditions because she <b>had</b> <b>contracted</b> malaria and was not replaced for them.|$|E
5|$|He left West Africa in January 1899, after a {{successful}} posting, but in ill-health; {{a third of}} the officers sent with him had died while on secondment, and Blackader <b>had</b> <b>contracted</b> malaria as well as suffering an attack of dysentery. He spent six months on leave to recover, and then sailed to take command of a company of the 1st Leicesters, still stationed in South Africa.|$|E

5|$|Mercury {{was born}} of Parsi descent in the Sultanate of Zanzibar, and grew up there and in India before moving {{with his family to}} Middlesex, England, in his teens. He formed Queen in 1970 with guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor. Mercury died in 1991 at age 45 due to {{complications}} from AIDS, having confirmed the day before his death that he <b>had</b> <b>contracted</b> the disease.|$|E
5|$|The fort {{was also}} used as a {{temporary}} naval hospital in the late 1820s and early 1830s, before Bighi Hospital was opened. During the cholera epidemic of 1837, patients who <b>had</b> <b>contracted</b> the disease at the Ospizio in Floriana were transferred to Ricasoli. Most of them died within a few days, and they were buried within the nearby Wied Għammieq cemetery. Another cholera epidemic broke out at Ricasoli in 1865.|$|E
5|$|After {{the lethal}} second wave struck in late 1918, new cases dropped abruptly– almost to nothing after {{the peak in}} the second wave. In Philadelphia, for example, 4,597 {{people died in the}} week ending 16 October, but by 11 November, {{influenza}} had almost disappeared from the city. One explanation for the rapid decline of the lethality of the disease is that doctors simply got better at preventing and treating the pneumonia that developed after the victims <b>had</b> <b>contracted</b> the virus, although John Barry stated in his book that researchers have found no evidence to support this.|$|E

5|$|At age 15, Redding {{left school}} to help financially support his family; his father <b>had</b> <b>contracted</b> {{tuberculosis}} and was often hospitalized, leaving his mother as the family's primary income earner. He {{worked as a}} well digger, as a gasoline station attendant and occasionally as a musician. Pianist Gladys Williams, a locally well-known musician in Macon and another who inspired Redding, often performed at the Hillview Springs Social Club, and Redding sometimes played piano with her band there. Williams hosted Sunday talent shows, which Redding attended with two friends, singers Little Willie Jones and Eddie Ross.|$|E
5|$|The Christian Science Publishing Society publishes several periodicals, {{including}} the Christian Science Monitor, winner of seven Pulitzer Prizes between 1950 and 2002. This had a daily circulation in 1970 of 220,000, which by 2008 <b>had</b> <b>contracted</b> to 52,000. In 2009 it {{moved to a}} largely online presence with a weekly print run. In the 1980s the church produced its own television programs, and in 1991 it founded a 24-hour news channel, which closed with heavy losses after 13 months.|$|E
5|$|The ensuing {{economic}} and political crisis was arguably the worst since the country's independence. By the end of 2002, the economy <b>had</b> <b>contracted</b> by 20% since 1998. Over {{the course of two}} years, output fell by more than 15%, the Argentine peso lost three-quarters of its value, and registered unemployment exceeded 25%. Income poverty in Argentina grew from an already high 35.4% in October 2001 to a peak of 54.3% in October 2002.|$|E

5|$|The {{last major}} European {{outbreak}} of smallpox was in 1972 in Yugoslavia, after a pilgrim from Kosovo {{returned from the}} Middle East, where he <b>had</b> <b>contracted</b> the virus. The epidemic infected 175 people, causing 35 deaths. Authorities declared martial law, enforced quarantine, and undertook widespread re-vaccination of the population, enlisting {{the help of the}} WHO. In two months, the outbreak was over. Prior to this, there had been a smallpox outbreak in May–July 1963 in Stockholm, Sweden, brought from the Far East by a Swedish sailor; this had been dealt with by quarantine measures and vaccination of the local population.|$|E
5|$|Wiggins' family {{initially}} attributed {{his death}} to lung cancer {{that had led}} to respiratory failure. Family members {{said that he had}} gotten sick with a cough and that his condition had worsened quickly. Wiggins weighed under 75 pounds {{at the time of his}} death. Several days later, a physician disclosed that Wiggins' health problems were complications of AIDS. Wiggins stated that he <b>had</b> <b>contracted</b> the disease via intravenous drug use. He became the first baseball player known to have died from AIDS.|$|E
5|$|Alexander's death raised {{questions}} about the succession to the throne as well as the nature of the Greek regime. As the king <b>had</b> <b>contracted</b> an unequal marriage his descendants were not in the line of succession. The Hellenic Parliament demanded that Constantine I and Crown Prince George be excluded from the succession but sought to preserve the monarchy by selecting another member of the royal house as the new sovereign. On 29 October 1920, the Greek minister in Berne, acting {{under the direction of the}} Greek authorities, offered the throne to Alexander's younger brother, Prince Paul. Paul, however, refused to become king while his father and elder brother were alive, insisting that neither of them had renounced their rights to the throne and that he therefore could never legitimately wear the crown.|$|E

5|$|During Team Canada's stay in Moscow, the team's {{treatment}} {{was the source}} of numerous complaints by the players. When leaving Sweden, the team was informed that the players would stay at one hotel, their wives at another. The players threatened not to go, and the arrangements were changed to keep the players and wives together at the Intourist Hotel. The players' wives were fed sub-standard food and the players would smuggle some of their food to their wives. The team <b>had</b> <b>contracted</b> to have Canadian beer and steaks delivered to them in Moscow. The beer was lost at the airport, while the steaks were cut in half. At a practice after game six, the Soviets tried to cut short the Canadians' practice.|$|E
5|$|Early on September5, {{reconnaissance}} found {{a central}} barometric pressure of 995mbar (hPa; 29.38inHg), the lowest recorded {{in relation to}} the storm. Around this time, Babe also intensified into a hurricane, attaining maximum winds of 75mph (120km/h). Later that day, Hurricane Babe made landfall near Cocodrie, Louisiana and quickly weakened to a tropical storm. By landfall, the eye of Babe <b>had</b> <b>contracted</b> to roughly 14mi (23km). On September6, the storm had weakened to a tropical depression and was moving northeast into Mississippi. The system continued this movement for the following two days. While crossing South Carolina, forecasters thought that the system would emerge into the Atlantic Ocean and regenerate into a tropical depression. However, the remnants of Babe dissipated shortly before crossing into North Carolina early on September9.|$|E
5|$|Herb Hunter {{arranged}} {{for a group of}} All-Stars, including Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Earl Averill, Charlie Gehringer, Jimmie Foxx and Lefty Gomez, to tour Japan playing exhibitions against a Japanese all-star team. Despite the fact that Berg was a mediocre, third-string catcher, he was invited at the last minute to make the trip. Among the items Berg took with him to Japan were a 16-mm Bell & Howell movie camera and a letter from MovietoneNews, a New York City newsreel production company with which Berg <b>had</b> <b>contracted</b> to film the sights of his trip. When the team arrived in Japan, he gave a welcome speech in Japanese and also addressed the legislature.|$|E

5|$|Johnson was {{contracted}} {{to finish the}} edition in 18 months but as the months passed, his pace slowed. He told Charles Burney in December 1757 {{that it would take}} him until the following March to complete it. Before that could happen, in February 1758 he was arrested again for an unpaid debt of £40. The debt was soon repaid by Tonson, who <b>had</b> <b>contracted</b> Johnson to publish the work; this motivated Johnson to finish the edition to repay the favour. Although it took him another seven years to finish, Johnson completed a few volumes of his Shakespeare to prove his commitment to the project.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's work on The Plays of William Shakespeare took {{up most of}} his time. On 8 June 1756, Johnson {{published}} his Proposals for Printing, by Subscription, the Dramatick Works of William Shakespeare, which argued that previous editions of Shakespeare were edited incorrectly {{and needed to be}} corrected. Johnson's progress on the work slowed as the months passed, and he told music historian Charles Burney in December 1757 that it would take him until the following March to complete it. Before that could happen, he was arrested again, for a debt of £40, in February 1758. The debt was soon repaid by Jacob Tonson, who <b>had</b> <b>contracted</b> Johnson to publish Shakespeare, and this encouraged Johnson to finish his edition to repay the favour.

5|$|Three more {{individuals}} {{who say they}} had unprotected sex with Usher sued him on allegations of fraud, sexual battery, infliction of emotional distress and more, alleging that he was positive for the herpes virus and didn't tell them in advance. All three are represented by attorney Lisa Bloom who said {{at the news conference}} on 8 August 2017 that one of her three clients <b>had</b> <b>contracted</b> genital herpes allegedly from Usher. One of the accusers, Quantasia Sharpton, said she had unprotected sex with him after a concert she attended around her 19th birthday. The other two accusers, one male, one female, preferred to remain anonymous plaintiffs. Sharpton admitted she tested negative for herpes and Bloom stated she didn't know if the singer had the disease.|$|E
