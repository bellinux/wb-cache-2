40|$|Most {{windowing}} systems {{follow the}} independent overlapping windows approach, which {{emerged as an}} answer {{to the needs of the}} 80 s ' applications and technology. Advances in computers, display technology, and the applications demand more functionality from window management systems. Based on these changes and the problems of current windowing approaches, we have updated the requirements for multiwindow systems to guide new methods of window management. We propose elastic windows with improved spatial layout and rapid multi-window operations. Multi-window operations are achieved by <b>issuing</b> <b>operations</b> on window groups hierarchically organized in a space-filling tiled layout. Sophisticated multi-window operations and spatial layout dynamics helps users to handle fast task-switching and to structure their work environment to their rapidly changing needs. We claim that these multi-window operations and the improved spatial layout decrease the cognitive load on users. Users found our prototype system to be comprehensible and enjoyable as they playfully explored the way multiple windows are reshaped...|$|E
40|$|We present Iris, a practical, {{authenticated}} {{file system}} designed to support workloads from large enterprises storing data in the cloud and be resilient against potentially untrustworthy service providers. As a transparent layer enforcing strong integrity guarantees, Iris lets an enterprise tenant maintain a large file system in the cloud. In Iris, tenants obtain strong assurance not just on data integrity, but also on data freshness, as well as data retrievability in case of accidental or adversarial cloud failures. Iris offers an architecture scalable to many clients (on the order of hundreds or even thousands) <b>issuing</b> <b>operations</b> on the file system in parallel. Iris includes new optimization and enterprise-side caching techniques specifically designed to overcome the high network latency typically experienced when accessing cloud storage. Iris also includes novel erasure coding techniques for efficient support of dynamic Proofs of Retrievability (PoR) protocols over the file system. We describe our architecture and experimental results on a prototype version of Iris. Iris achieves end-to-end throughput of up to 260 MB per second for 100 clients issuing simultaneous requests on the file system. (This limit is dictated by the available network bandwidth and maximum hard drive throughput.) We demonstrate that strong integrity protection in the cloud can be achieved with minimal performance degradation. ...|$|E

40|$|The memory {{consistency}} {{model in}} a language defines {{the order in which}} the results of write operations maybe observed through read operations. The behavior of a UPC program may depend on the timing of accesses to shared variables, so a program defines a set of possible executions, rather than a single execution. The memory consistency model constrains the set of possible executions for a given program; the user may then rely on properties that are true of all of those executions. The memory consistency model is defined in terms of the read and write operations issued by each thread in naive translation of the code, i. e., without any code transformations by the compiler, with each thread <b>issuing</b> <b>operations</b> as defined by the abstract machine defined in ISO C 5. 1. 2. 3. A UPC compiler or run time system may perform various code transformations to improve performance, so long as they are not visible to the programmer - i. e., provided the set of externally-visible behaviors (the input/output dynamics and volatile behavior defined in ISO C 5. 1. 2. 3) from any execution of the transformed program are identical to those of the original program executing on the abstract machine and adhering to the consistency model defined in this document...|$|E
40|$|Most {{windowing}} systems {{follow the}} independent overlapping windows approach, which {{emerged as an}} answer to the needs of early computer users. Due to advances in computers, display technology, and increased information needs, modern users demand more functionality from window management systems. We propose Elastic Windows with improved spatial layout and rapid multi-window operations as an alternative to current window management strategies. In this approach, multi-window operations are achieved by <b>issuing</b> <b>operations</b> on window groups hierarchically organized in a space-filling tiled layout similar to TreeMaps. 1 Sophisticated multiwindow operations have been developed to handle fast task-switching and to structure the work environment of users to their rapidly changing needs. We claim that these multi-window operations and the tiled spatial layout dynamics decrease the cognitive load on users by decreasing the number of window operations. This paper describes the Elastic Windows interface in detail and then presents a user study conducted to compare the performance of 12 users with Elastic Windows and traditional Independent Overlapping Windows. User performance was measured in terms of task environment setup, switching, and task execution for 2, 6, and 12 window situations. Elastic Windows users had statistically significantly faster performance for all tasks in 6 and 12 window situations. These results suggest promising possibilities for multiple window operations and hierarchical nesting, which {{can be applied to the}} next generation of tiled as well as overlapped window managers. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. key words: window management; multi-window operations; hierarchical windows; personal role management; World Wide Web; windowing system evaluatio...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} two game-theoretic {{settings to}} determine the optimal values of an issuer 2 ̆ 7 s interchange fee rate, an acquirer 2 ̆ 7 s merchant discount rate, and a merchant 2 ̆ 7 s retail price in a credit card network. In the first setting, we investigate a two-stage game problem in which the issuer and the acquirer first negotiate the interchange fee rate, and the acquirer and the retailer then determine their merchant discount rate and retail price, respectively. In the second setting, motivated by the recent US bill “H. R. 2695,” we develop a three-player cooperative game in which the issuer, the acquirer, and the merchant form a grand coalition and bargain over the interchange fee rate and the merchant discount rate. Following the cooperative game, the retailer makes its retail pricing decision. We derive both the Shapley value- and the nucleolus-characterized, and globally-optimal unique rates for the grand coalition. Comparing the two game settings, {{we find that the}} participation of the merchant in the negotiation process can result in the reduction of both rates. Moreover, the stability of the grand coalition in the cooperative game setting may require that the merchant should delegate the credit card business only to the issuer and the acquirer with sufficiently low operation costs. We also show that the grand coalition {{is more likely to be}} stable and the U. S. bill “H.
