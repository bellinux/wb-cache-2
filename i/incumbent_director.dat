As a result, there was confusion at IIM-L campus for almost a week. The allegations against Devi Singh, who served two term as director of IIM-L, ranges from nepotism to mismanagement of accounts. The Central Vigilance Commission also asked the HRD ministry to 're investigate' allegations of corruption against Devi Singh.|$|E

40|$|I {{address the}} problem of {{corporate}} governance. I offer a theory of CEO replacement, using Nash bargaining game. CEO replacement involves the board monitoring of the CEOs and the CEO succession policy, which is in regards to the inside promotion or the outside recruiting of the new CEO when the incumbent CEO is fired. I argue that CEO replacement decisions made by the incumbent CEO and the <b>incumbent</b> <b>directors</b> may exhibit inefficiencies from the point of maximizing corporate profit, and instead, these decisions tend to favor the <b>incumbent</b> <b>directors</b> and the CEO themselves...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows that}} proxy {{contests}} {{have a significant}} adverse effect on careers of <b>incumbent</b> <b>directors.</b> Following a proxy contest, directors experience a significant decline in number of directorships {{not only in the}} targeted company, but also in other non-targeted companies. The results are established using the universe of all proxy contests during 1996 - 2010. To establish that this effect of proxy contests is causal, we use within-firm variation in directors’ exposure to proxy contests and exploit the predetermined schedule of staggered boards that only allows a fraction of directors to be nominated for election every year. We find that nominated directors relative to non-nominated ones lose 45 % more seats on other boards. We discuss that this pattern can be expected if proxy contest mechanism imposes a signifi-cant career cost on <b>incumbent</b> <b>directors...</b>|$|R

50|$|In a proxy fight, <b>incumbent</b> <b>directors</b> and {{management}} have the odds stacked {{in their favor}} over those trying to force the corporate change. These incumbents use various corporate governance tactics to stay in power, including: staggering the boards (i.e., having different election years for different directors), controlling access to the corporation's money, and creating restrictive requirements in the bylaws. As a result, most proxy fights are unsuccessful. However, it has been recently noted that proxy fights waged by hedge funds are successful more than 60% of the time.|$|R
40|$|We {{identify}} a commitment problem that prevents bidders from unseating resisting and entrenched <b>incumbent</b> <b>directors</b> of target companies through proxy fights. We discuss potential remedies {{and argue that}} activist investors are more resilient to this commitment problem and can mitigate the resulting inefficiencies by putting such companies into play. This result holds even if bidders and activists have similar expertise and can use similar techniques to challenge the incumbents, and it {{is consistent with the}} evidence that most proxy fights are launched by activists, not by bidders. Building on this insight, we study the implications of activist interventions on the M 2 ̆ 6 A market...|$|R

Although the existing regulatory regime does not clearly address the legitimacy of most defensive tactics, the Chinese regulatory authorities implicitly allow such ATPs. This thesis reveals that the widely adopted ATPs can effectively impede potential takeovers and provide undue protection to inefficient <b>incumbent</b> <b>directors</b> and dominant shareholders. The development of an active corporate control market will be significantly delayed if such ATPs are condoned. This thesis argues {{that the use of}} ex ante takeover defences should not be allowed.
