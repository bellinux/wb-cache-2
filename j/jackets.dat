Georgia Tech head coach Paul Johnson, entering his second season {{as head of the}} Yellow <b>Jackets,</b> had high hopes that Georgia Tech would be able to improve upon its 2008 performance. Others agreed with Johnson's assumption, as the Yellow <b>Jackets</b> were ranked No. 15 in the preseason Associated Press and USA Today coaches' polls.|$|E
5|$|After {{beginning}} the 2007–08 {{season with the}} Pirates, Rome was traded from the Ducks to the Columbus Blue <b>Jackets,</b> along with Clay Wilson, for Geoff Platt, on November 15, 2007. Rome {{was assigned to the}} Blue Jackets' AHL affiliate, the Syracuse Crunch, immediately following the trade. After appearing in 41 games with Syracuse, scoring 3 goals and 24 points, he was called up to Columbus on February 26, 2008. He scored his first NHL goal late in the season against goaltender Dominik Hašek, in a 3–2 loss against the Red Wings on April 3, 2008. After his first Blue <b>Jackets</b> training camp in September 2008, Rome was placed on waivers. After clearing, he was assigned to start the season with Syracuse. He remained with the Crunch until February 2009, when he was recalled by the Blue <b>Jackets</b> {{for the remainder of the}} 2008–09 season. He played eight games with the Blue <b>Jackets,</b> registering one assist. Over 48 games in the AHL, he notched 7 goals and 28 points. Rome remained with the Blue <b>Jackets</b> for the franchise's first playoff season in 2009, competing in one game. Columbus was eliminated in the first round by Detroit.|$|E

5|$|After {{being drafted}} by the Blue <b>Jackets,</b> Filatov signed a three-year {{contract}} with the club on July 10, 2008. His base salary for the contract was $875,000, with bonus clauses that could bring the value as high as $1.35million per season. His signing with Columbus created some controversy within the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), however, as League President Alexander Medvedev claimed that the Blue <b>Jackets</b> owed CSKA Moscow compensation of at least $1.5million for signing Filatov. Medvedev claimed that although the term of the contract had expired, under Russian law it did not terminate until an indemnity amount had been negotiated. The Blue <b>Jackets</b> and Filatov believed that giving his club 30 days notice was sufficient to terminate the contract. CSKA threatened to withhold Filatov's transfer card, thus impeding his ability to play in another league, but Filatov, his lawyers and the Blue <b>Jackets</b> believed they had followed the necessary tenets of Russian law. Filatov's contract was one of six reviewed by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) {{in an attempt to}} mediate the disputes between the KHL and NHL. During this investigation, the players were unable to play international hockey sanctioned by the IIHF. In September, the KHL dropped its opposition to Filatov's contract with the Blue <b>Jackets,</b> and he received his transfer.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{effectiveness}} of four different carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) hybridized methods to retrofit the high strength concrete columns with shear capacity deficiency {{for improving the}} shear behavior is described in this paper. These retrofitting methods include the wrapped <b>jacketing,</b> the L-shaped <b>jacketing</b> combined with wrapped <b>jacketing,</b> the clamp plates plus wrapped <b>jacketing</b> and the L-shaped <b>jacketing,</b> clamp plates and wrapped <b>jacketing.</b> Five specimens were tested under low reversed cyclic loading. The influence of retrofitting on the failure mode, ductility, strength, stiffness degradation, and distribution of CFRP strain is analyzed. The {{results indicate that the}} retrofitted specimens exhibit high levels of ductility superior to the reference specimen. Among the four retrofitting methods, the {{effectiveness of}} method of only the wrapped <b>jacketing</b> is the worst, the method of the clamp plates plus wrapped <b>jacketing</b> has better performance compared to the method of the L-shaped <b>jacketing</b> combined with wrapped <b>jacketing,</b> and the method of the L-shaped <b>jacketing,</b> clamp plates and wrapped <b>jacketing</b> performs best...|$|R
5|$|At the 2008 NHL Entry Draft, Filatov was {{selected}} sixth overall by the Columbus Blue <b>Jackets.</b> Filatov was the top-ranked European skater by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau. Filatov played two {{seasons with the}} Blue <b>Jackets</b> organization. During the 2009–10 season, Filatov was unhappy with his situation in Columbus and was loaned to CSKA Moscow {{for the remainder of}} the season. At the 2011 NHL Entry Draft, the Blue <b>Jackets</b> then traded him to Ottawa in exchange for a third-round draft pick. In December 2011, the Senators loaned Filatov to CSKA Moscow for the balance of the 2011–12 season. The following season, Filatov signed with Salavat Yulaev. The Senators chose not to tender Filatov a qualifying offer, making him a free agent.|$|E
5|$|At the {{completion}} of his contract following the 2016–17 season, Schroeder as a restricted free agent {{was not to be}} tendered a new contract with the Wild. Approaching his free agent status, Schroeder was traded by the Wild to the Columbus Blue <b>Jackets</b> in exchange for Dante Salituro on June 23, 2017. He was later signed by the Blue <b>Jackets</b> to avoid free agency with a two-year contract on June 27, 2017.|$|E
5|$|Because Clemson {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Georgia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Chris Tanner returned the kickoff to the Tech 29-yard line, and the Yellow <b>Jackets</b> began the first offensive drive of the half. Jones opened the drive with a 16-yard run, then the Yellow <b>Jackets</b> converted a fourth down to continue down the field. Six plays after the fourth-down conversion, Tech quarterback Nesbitt ran {{into the end zone}} for a touchdown. The following extra point gave Tech a 23–13 lead with 9:12 remaining.|$|E

5|$|Columbus started March with a 2–0 shutout {{against the}} Colorado Avalanche. They {{proceeded}} {{to win their}} next game against the Phoenix Coyotes 5–2, which {{marked the first time}} that the Blue <b>Jackets</b> posted back-to-back regulation victories during the season. Columbus again defeated the Coyotes three days later to earn their first three-game win streak of the season. They extended the streak to four with a win over the Los Angeles Kings before it came to an end with a 4–1 loss to the St. Louis Blues. It was the only four-game win streak of the season for the Blue <b>Jackets.</b> They immediately matched their four-game win streak with a four-game losing streak and with ten games remaining, the Blue <b>Jackets</b> were the first team eliminated from playoff contention. Shortly after being eliminated, they were defeated by the Edmonton Oilers 6–3; the loss clinched last place in the NHL for Columbus. It was the first time in franchise history the Blue <b>Jackets</b> finished in 30th place.|$|E
5|$|During the {{off-season}} the Blue <b>Jackets</b> parted ways with defensemen Jan Hejda, Anton Stralman, Sami Lepisto and Mike Commodore. Hejda, who played {{four of his}} first five NHL seasons with the Blue <b>Jackets,</b> was offered a contract by Columbus, but felt that the organization undervalued him and left via free agency. Columbus had offered him a three-year, $7.5 million contract. He instead signed a four-year, $13 million deal with the Colorado Avalanche. Stralman and Lepisto were not given qualifying offers which made them unrestricted free agents, and both signed with other teams. Commodore had originally signed a big contract with the Blue <b>Jackets</b> in 2008, but fell out of favor. He was waived, sent to the minors and eventually had his contract bought out. In order to replace the departed players, Columbus not only acquired James Wisniewski, but also signed ten-year NHL veteran Radek Martinek. Martinek played only seven games with the Blue <b>Jackets</b> before suffering a concussion and missing {{the remainder of the}} season. Brett Lebda was brought in to replace him.|$|E
5|$|Filatov did {{not make}} the team after {{attending}} training camp with the Blue <b>Jackets,</b> instead making his North American professional debut for the Blue Jackets' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Syracuse Crunch. On October 15, 2008, however, Filatov was called up to the NHL, playing in his first game and scoring his first goal with the Blue <b>Jackets</b> on October 17 against the Nashville Predators. For the rest of the 2008–09 season, Filatov split time between the AHL and the NHL. He played eight games with the Blue <b>Jackets,</b> finishing the season with four goals. He became the first Blue <b>Jackets</b> rookie to record a hat-trick in the January 10, 2009, game against the Minnesota Wild. At the end of the season, Filatov had played 39 games with the Crunch in the AHL, scoring 16 goals and 16 assists. For his performances, he was named as a starter for the PlanetUSA team in the 2009 AHL All-Star Game.|$|E

5|$|Finishing {{with the}} worst record in the NHL, Columbus had {{the best chance of}} {{receiving}} the first overall pick in the 2012 draft. With the NHL's weighted draft lottery the Blue <b>Jackets</b> had a 48.2% chance of drafting first overall. However, the lottery was won by the Edmonton Oilers, who proceeded to leapfrog Columbus and secure the number one draft pick for a third consecutive year. It was the fifth time that the Blue <b>Jackets</b> were dropped one draft position in the franchise's 12 lottery participations.|$|E
5|$|Following the Richmond Depot, other depots {{started up}} {{throughout}} the South to supply their respective regional forces. Major depots were in Columbus, Athens and Atlanta, Georgia for the Army of Tennessee and Houston, Texas and Shreveport, Louisiana for the Trans-Mississippi forces. The {{use of the}} depot system meant that army-wide uniformity was impossible, as different depots had unique uniforms (Columbus Depot <b>Jackets</b> for instance, had breast pockets, whilst Richmond Depot <b>Jackets</b> did not). This resulted in a varied set of uniforms worn by different Confederate units.|$|E

In addition, Clemson's offense was almost completely shutdown by Georgia Tech's defense in the first half, and the Tigers were plagued by turnovers, which contributed to the win for the Yellow <b>Jackets.</b>|$|E

This led him to try out for another professional team, the Baltimore Orioles of the Eastern Amateur Hockey League (EAHL). Unfortunately for Brimsek, the Orioles decided to cut him. Disappointed, Brimsek hitchhiked back to Eveleth. On his way back home, he had a chance meeting with the owner of the Pittsburgh Yellow <b>Jackets,</b> John H. Harris.

The thick <b>jacket</b> material kept {{the tips of}} the <b>jacket</b> from bending as easily as a normal thickness <b>jacket.</b> The slits that weakened the <b>jacket</b> left triangular shapes in the tip of the <b>jacket,</b> and these triangular sections of <b>jacket</b> would end up pointing out after expansion, leading to the [...] "Talon" [...] name. The bullets were coated with a black colored, paint-like lubricant called [...] "Lubalox," [...] and loaded into nickel-plated brass cases, which made them visually stand out from other ammunition. While actual performance of the Black Talon rounds was not significantly better than any other comparable high performance hollow-point ammunition, the reverse taper <b>jacket</b> did provide reliable expansion under a wide range of conditions, and many police departments adopted the round.|$|R
