He drafted the Constitution of Malaysia, and as Commissioner of Law Revision wrote the Internal Security Act (ISA) of 1960, which {{provided for the}} <b>detention</b> <b>of</b> persons without trial. The ISA was later used to oppress political opponents or those dedicated to non-violent activities, which Hickling later said was not his intention.|$|E

5|$|The {{issue of}} whether the Act was constitutionally valid {{revolved}} around the fact that immigration detention {{is a form of}} administrative detention, or detention imposed by the executive branch of government. Detention generally {{is considered to be a}} judicial function, which can be exercised only by courts, pursuant to Chapter III of the Australian Constitution. However, there are certain exceptions which allow non-judicial detention, such as detention in order to effect an arrest, or detention for quarantine purposes. Courts in Australia have also held that, generally, <b>detention</b> <b>of</b> non-citizens for immigration purposes is also valid.|$|E

5|$|The {{principle}} that the correct test in judicial review proceedings is an objective one continues to apply in cases not involving the Internal Security Act. In Kamal Jit Singh v. Minister for Home Affairs (1992), the Court of Appeal remarked that, following Chng Suan Tze, {{the power of the}} Minister for Home Affairs under section 30(a) of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act to order the preventive <b>detention</b> <b>of</b> a person was dependent on the Minister's objective, and not subjective, satisfaction that the person was associated with criminal activities.|$|E
5|$|A new {{resettlement}} programme was {{proposed by the}} British Home Secretary, David Blunkett in October 2001, having been hinted at by the previous Home Secretary, Jack Straw, {{in a speech to}} the European Conference on Asylum in Lisbon in June 2000. The legal basis for the programme's funding was established by Section 59 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. This act was passed by the House of Commons by 362 votes to 74 in June 2002 and by the House of Lords – at the ninth attempt, following concern about the introduction of measures allowing for the <b>detention</b> <b>of</b> asylum seekers in rural areas) – in November 2002.|$|E
5|$|Al-Kateb v Godwin, was a {{decision}} of the High Court of Australia, which ruled on 6 August 2004 that the indefinite <b>detention</b> <b>of</b> a stateless person was lawful.

The Commonwealth Minister for Immigration's decision to refuse the application was upheld by the Refugee Review Tribunal and the Federal Court. In 2002, Al-Kateb declared that he wished to return to Kuwait or Gaza. However, since no country would accept Al-Kateb, he was declared stateless and detained under the policy of mandatory detention.|$|E

In the last phase, slaughter house wastewater was added to row sewage 50 - 50. With a <b>detention</b> time <b>of</b> 1 -day, reductions in COD and TSS were 80 and 98 %...|$|R
5|$|Although {{potentially}} dangerous objects and money were confiscated and stored when a prisoner first entered the Bastille, most wealthy prisoners continued {{to bring in}} additional luxuries, including pet dogs or cats to control the local vermin. The Marquis de Sade, for example, arrived with an elaborate wardrobe, paintings, tapestries, a selection of perfume, {{and a collection of}} 133 books. Card games and billiards were played among the prisoners, and alcohol and tobacco were permitted. Servants could sometimes accompany their masters into the Bastille, as in the cases of the 1746 <b>detention</b> <b>of</b> the family of Lord Morton and their entire household as British spies: the family's domestic life continued on inside the prison relatively normally. The prisoners' library had grown during the 18th century, mainly through ad hoc purchases and various confiscations by the Crown, until by 1787 it included 389 volumes.|$|E
5|$|An {{incident}} at PJC illustrated Robinson's impatience with authority figures he perceived as racist—a character trait that would resurface repeatedly in his life. On January 25, 1938, {{he was arrested}} after vocally disputing the <b>detention</b> <b>of</b> a black friend by police. Robinson received a two-year suspended sentence, but the incident—along with other rumored run-ins between Robinson and police—gave Robinson a reputation for combativeness {{in the face of}} racial antagonism. While at PJC, he was motivated by a preacher (the Rev. Karl Downs) to attend church on a regular basis, and Downs became a confidant for Robinson, a Christian. Toward the end of his PJC tenure, Frank Robinson (to whom Robinson felt closest among his three brothers) was killed in a motorcycle accident. The event motivated Jackie to pursue his athletic career at the nearby University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he could remain closer to Frank's family.|$|E

Khánh offered no evidence, only claiming that the French had paid a hitman US$1300 to kill him, before later inflating the supposed reward for his assassination. American intelligence officials in Vietnam privately said that they were not aware of any such threat.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, the Rowlatt Act gave {{extensive}} {{powers to}} the British government and police, and allowed indefinite arrest and <b>detention</b> <b>of</b> individuals, warrant-less searches and seizures, restrictions on public gatherings, and intensive censorship {{of media and}} publications. The public opposition to this act eventually led to mass campaigns of non-violent civil disobedience throughout the country demanding guaranteed civil freedoms, and limitations on government power. Indians, who were seeking independence and their own government, were particularly influenced by the independence of Ireland {{and the development of}} the Irish constitution. Also, the directive principles of state policy in Irish constitution were looked upon by the people of India as an inspiration for the independent India's government to comprehensively tackle complex social and economic challenges across a vast, diverse nation and population.|$|E
