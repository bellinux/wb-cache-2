40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{international}} civil aviation safety purely in the sense of,,security" which means protection against {{acts of unlawful interference}} against civil aviation. The thesis is composed of ten chapters. Chapter two is introductory and defines basic notions as aircraft piracy or aviation terrorism. Chapter three characterises main forms of acts of unlawful interference against civil aviation as they were regarded in the past as well as in nowadays. Chapter four is concerned with legal sources of the International Aviation Law. Chapter five describes origins of the international repressive system and provides interpretation of the most important international antiterrorism conventions. Chapter six focuses on <b>the</b> <b>exercise</b> of <b>juridiction</b> and extradition under the Tokyo Convention from 1963, the Hague Convention from 1970 and the Montreal Convention from 1971. The classification of unlawful acts against the civil aviation based on the responsibility for such acts is the object of the chapter seven.

Assuming that the population is split into three jurisdictions of respective size n 1, n 2 and n 3, we derive exact formulas for the probability of the referendum paradox under the Impartial Culture model.
