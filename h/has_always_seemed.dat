500|$|Mayberry {{made the}} Phillies' opening day roster {{for the first}} time, and {{recorded}} the game-winning RBI via a pinch hit single in the Phillies' first game, but was optioned back to the minors after the Phillies activated Shane Victorino from the disabled list in early June. Subsequently, Mayberry returned to the big-league club when Victorino {{went back to the}} disabled list. Throughout 2011, Mayberry did not have a defined role on the club. In August, columnist David Murphy wrote, [...] "While the Phillies may not see evidence that Mayberry should be part of their everyday plans, it is getting hard to ignore the two huge offensive tools he brings to the table: immense power, and a curious ability to hit when it counts." [...] He added, [...] "Charlie Manuel <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> to have a soft spot in his heart for Mayberry. And, more importantly, he <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> to have a knack for when to put him into a game." [...] Manuel compared Mayberry to former Phillie Jayson Werth in terms of their size, athleticism, {{and the fact that they}} both hit better against left-handed pitching than right-handed pitching, noting that he planned to give Mayberry a chance to start if Ben Francisco floundered. Ultimately, the Phillies traded away Francisco after the season, in part due to Mayberry's emergence. He finished the season batting [...]273/.341/.513, with a [...]854 OPS and 15 home runs in 104 games, and made his postseason debut in the National League Division Series against the St. Louis Cardinals that September.|$|E
500|$|A different, widely {{circulated}} story {{suggests that}} Peel urinated on the pitch before being dismissed by Hawke. Woodhouse, writing in 1989, suggested that [...] "it {{is difficult to}} ascertain the truth behind this long-standing tale", while Hodgson observes: [...] "I have never been convinced of this account because it <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> {{to be so much}} out of character for a cricketer of that time when so much stress was placed upon behaving 'like a gentleman' even in one's cups." [...] Mick Pope writes: [...] "The more recent accusation that Peel urinated on the pitch remains unjust, unproven and such a myth... that it should have no place in any study of Bobby Peel, the cricketer." [...] The story originated in a cricket publication, Cricket Quarterly, in 1968. The historian Rowland Bowen, in an article called [...] "Fresh Light on the Dismissal of R Peel in 1897", claimed that an [...] "aged Yorkshireman of 85" [...] told him that Peel had urinated and that this was a common practice then. Subsequent research by the historian Irving Rosewater established that Bowen's information came to him second-hand. The 85-year-old had not used the word [...] "urinated" [...] but had actually said [...] "pissed at the wicket", meaning that Peel was drunk ("pissed" [...] being slang for drunk) on the pitch ("at the wicket"). Rosewater suggests that this was merely repetition of the already known story, not the new information claimed by Bowen. Rosewater self-published his findings in a book called An Unjust Slur on Bobby Peel in 1997.|$|E

500|$|Australia won the toss. The match {{began in}} damp conditions, {{and before the}} pitch began to dry, at which point it would become {{extremely}} difficult for batting, the Australian opening batsmen scored 135 in 90 minutes; Australia's total reached 173 for one wicket at lunch, and Victor Trumper scored a century in that time. MacLaren was subsequently criticised for allowing Australia to score so quickly, but claimed that his carefully planned strategy was rendered obsolete when Trumper began to strike {{the ball out of}} the ground. MacLaren commented: [...] "I couldn't very well have had a man fielding in the bloody practice ground, now could I?" [...] The bowlers recovered the situation to some extent, and following a century from Jackson, England trailed by 37 runs after the first innings. In the second innings, Australia collapsed to the England bowlers, but Tate dropped a crucial catch while stationed by MacLaren {{at the edge of the}} field. MacLaren also received criticism for this, as Tate was unaccustomed to fielding on the boundary. Gibson notes that MacLaren [...] "later spent much breath defending himself on this point"; although it is not clear how Tate came to be moved—a later interpretation is that MacLaren moved Tate there rather than ask an amateur player to cross the field for a few deliveries—most commentators agree that this was the turning point of the match. England were left needing 124 runs to win. MacLaren opened the batting, having batted at number four in the first innings, and tried to score quickly, but was caught from a big hit. According to Gibson, he returned to the dressing room in fury, throwing his bat across the room and saying that he had [...] "thrown away the match and the bloody rubber [...] ". Gibson suggests that the implication that only MacLaren could have guided England to victory must have had a demoralising effect on the remaining batsmen, and speculates that he felt guilty over the composition of a team that looked likely to lose. Gibson comments: [...] "This does not say much for MacLaren as a captain. Indeed, it <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> to me a shocking performance, from the choice of the team to the chuck of the bat." [...] Wickets continued to fall and Tate, the last batsman, was bowled when England needed four runs to win.|$|E

In his {{presence}} I was almost always reduced to total silence. This was an extremely good thing, as it meant that we concentrated exclusively on the music. Above all, he taught me the meaning of silence and the meaning of singing. He said I was incredibly obstinate and did only what I wanted to. It's true that I've only ever played what I wanted. And so he left me to do as I liked." ...|$|E

The totalitarian Thirty Tyrants had anointed themselves as the elite, and {{in the minds of}} his Athenian accusers, Socrates was guilty because he was suspected of introducing oligarchic ideas to them. Larry Gonick, in his [...] "Cartoon History of the Universe" [...] writes, [...] "The trial of Socrates <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> mysterious...the charges sound vague and unreal...because behind the stated charges was Socrates real crime: preaching a philosophy that produced Alcibiades and Critias... but of course he couldn't be prosecuted for that under the amnesty(which had been declared after the overthrow of the Thirty Tyrants)... so his accusers made it [...] "not believing the Gods of the city, introducing new Gods, and corrupting the youth." ...|$|E

2500|$|Originally {{published}} as The Secret Ascension by Tor Books in 1987 (but subsequently reprinted with the author's preferred title), {{this work is}} an homage to writer Philip K. Dick, a pastiche of his style, and includes an alternate reality version of Dick as a character. [...] The novel {{is set in a}} world in which Richard Milrose Nixon, in his fourth term as president, holds fascistic control over America, and the science fiction works of Philip K. Dick remain unpublished, distributed underground as samizdat, while his realist fiction titles are the ones that are celebrated as masterpieces. Author and reviewer Orson Scott Card writes that [...] "the climax is not just an inward epiphany for a character… he world changes in wonderful strange ways, and the audience can read the book passionately, with sweating fingers, eager to see what happens next, yet reluctant to leave the present moment. Imagine: A writer who is already one of the best, taking risks and finding ways to be better." [...] Card does take Bishop to task for the author's characterization of Richard Nixon, calling it a [...] "caricature" [...] and a [...] "stock character of a madman." [...] Locus reviewer Tom Whitmore calls the book [...] "a masterful pastiche" [...] and [...] "…the closest thing to a classic Dick sf novel anyone has ever done." [...] Gerald Jonas in the New York Times writes [...] "Mr. Bishop is a solid, serious writer whose reach (in his previous work) <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> to me to exceed his grasp. Here, he catches some of Dick's fire, especially in the early chapters… Then a lot happens very quickly (as in some of Dick's own novels), and the satire, which should hold things together, turns predictable. But…the ending (starring Philip K. Dick) approaches sublimity." [...] The novel was nominated for the Arthur C. Clarke Award in 1989.|$|E
