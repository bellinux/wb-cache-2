40|$|Dengue/dengue {{hemorrhagic fever}} is the world's most widely spread mosquito-borne arboviral disease and threatens {{more than two-thirds}} of the world's population. Cases are mainly {{distributed}} in tropical and subtropical areas in accordance with vector habitats for Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus. However, the role of <b>imported</b> <b>cases</b> and favorable meteorological conditions has not yet been quantitatively assessed. This study verified the correlation between the occurrence of indigenous dengue and <b>imported</b> <b>cases</b> in the context of weather variables (temperature, rainfall, relative humidity, etc.) for different time lags in southern Taiwan. Our findings imply that <b>imported</b> <b>cases</b> have a role in igniting indigenous outbreaks, in non-endemics areas, when favorable weather conditions are present. This relationship becomes insignificant in the late phase of local dengue epidemics. Therefore, early detection and <b>case</b> management of <b>imported</b> <b>cases</b> through timely surveillance and rapid laboratory-diagnosis may avert large scale epidemics of dengue/dengue hemorrhagic fever. An early-warning surveillance system integrating meteorological data will be an invaluable tool for successful prevention and control of dengue, particularly in non-endemic countries...|$|R

40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					Swaziland {{has made}} great {{progress}} towards {{its goal of}} malaria elimination by 2015. However, malaria importation from neighbouring high-endemic Mozambique through Swaziland&# 8217;s eastern border remains a major factor that could prevent elimination from being achieved. In order to reach elimination, Swaziland must rapidly identify and treat <b>imported</b> malaria <b>cases</b> before onward transmission occurs. 				 				 					 						Methods 					A nationwide formative assessment was conducted over eight weeks {{to determine if the}} <b>imported</b> <b>cases</b> of malaria identified by the Swaziland National Malaria Control Programme could be linked to broader social networks and to explore methods to access these networks. 				 				 					 						Results 					Using a structured format, interviews were carried out with malaria surveillance agents (6), health providers (10), previously identified <b>imported</b> malaria <b>cases</b> (19) and people belonging to the networks identified through these interviews (25). Most <b>imported</b> malaria <b>cases</b> were Mozambicans (63 %, 12 / 19) making a living in Swaziland and sustaining their families in Mozambique. The majority of <b>imported</b> <b>cases</b> (73 %, 14 / 19) were labourers and self-employed contractors who travelled frequently to Mozambique to visit their families and conduct business. Social networks of <b>imported</b> <b>cases</b> with similar travel patterns were identified through these interviews. Nearly all <b>imported</b> <b>cases</b> (89 %, 17 / 19) were willing to share contact information to enable network members to be interviewed. Interviews of network members and key informants revealed common congregation points, such as the urban market places in Manzini and Malkerns, as well as certain bus stations, where people with similar travel patterns and malaria risk behaviours could be located and tested for malaria. 				 				 					 						Conclusion 					This study demonstrated that <b>imported</b> <b>cases</b> of malaria belonged to networks of people with similar travel patterns. This study may provide novel methods for screening high-risk groups of travellers using both snowball sampling and time-location sampling of networks to identify and treat additional malaria cases. Implementation of a proactive screening programme of importation networks may help Swaziland halt transmission and achieve malaria elimination by 2015...|$|R

50|$|After WHO {{raised the}} {{influenza}} pandemic phase to phase 4 on April 28, 2009, Taiwan established the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC), and convened the first CECC {{meeting on the}} same day.

Besides routine fever screening, {{which has been in}} place since the SARS period in 2003, multiple border quarantine measures began on April 29 to delay the importation of the virus, as a result of meeting. On-board quarantine was performed on all flights came directly from the Americas and passengers were encouraged to report voluntarily to quarantine officers if they had flu-like symptoms. Through enhanced screening and quarantine, the first <b>imported</b> <b>case</b> was found when a 52-year-old foreign resident of Taiwan returned from the United States via Hong Kong on May 20. The man had been in the United States from February 20 to May 18 and was symptomatic on his flight back to Taiwan. He was sent to designated hospital directly from the airport, isolated, treated with oseltamivir and recovered fully. All passengers seated within three rows of the ill passenger were contacted, given chemoprophylaxis and quarantined. Quarantine on board discontinued on May 20, after the first case was found. In the following week, 9 more imported cases were found by fever screening in the airport. On May 24, the first domestic case that became infected with influenza A (H1N1) through close contact with an <b>imported</b> <b>case</b> was diagnosed. Because of enhanced contact tracing and prophylactic treatment, local transmission of the virus was stopped and no other domestic cases were found.

The theoretical model we developed, which mimics the current surveillance system, predicted that without vector control (VC), the probability of local transmission after introduction of viraemic patients was around 2 %, {{and the number of}} autochthonous cases between five and 15 persons per hectare, depending on the number of <b>imported</b> <b>cases.</b> Compared with this baseline, we considered different strategies (VC after clinical suspicion of a case or after laboratory confirmation, for <b>imported</b> or autochthonous <b>cases)</b> : Awaiting laboratory confirmation for suspected <b>imported</b> <b>cases</b> to implement VC had no significant impact on the epidemiological outcomes analysed, mainly because of the delay before entering into the surveillance system.
