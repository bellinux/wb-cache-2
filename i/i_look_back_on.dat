5|$|As <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> it today, I see {{the whole}} picture very differently. It's true that I hated missing out on Sexton. And the first few months, I was miserable at Everett. But being bused to Everett {{turned out to be}} one of the best things that ever {{happened}} to me. It got me out of my own little world and taught me how to understand white people, how to communicate and deal with them.|$|E
500|$|He {{released}} Diamond Dreams in 2008. The {{album was}} a collaboration with Kent Goodson, pianist for country star George Jones. It tells baseball stories inspired by West's umpiring career. Goodson later said, [...] "As <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> how this CD came together, I realize that I am a musician and Joe is an umpire. But {{his love for}} music and my love for baseball bonded us in this project." [...] Sports blogger Voodoo Brown described West as [...] "in creepmode from the gate." [...] Sportswriter Doug Miller said that the album was [...] "a fun, humorous and often touching collection of spoken-word gems in which the listener gets a perfect sampling of the true personality of Cowboy Joe West." ...|$|E
500|$|In his {{autobiography}} released {{a few years}} later, Gerrard reflected that Liverpool were fortunate to win, but was critical of Arsenal's [...] "bitter" [...] reaction: [...] "Wenger and Ljungberg kept complaining about the hand-balls. Get real, boys. That's football. Grow up." [...] He reserved special praise for his opponent Vieira however, saying {{a few days after}} the game: [...] "It was my job to try and stop him, but he definitely got the better of me that day. He's such a great player. He's so fit, and he dictates the pace of a game. There are a lot of things you can learn just by watching him." [...] Assessing his career in a column for the Telegraph, Owen wrote that winning the cup was [...] "...the best day of my career, the game <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> more than any other and think it was the most exhilarating experience I ever had playing football." ...|$|E
60|$|Under these dreadful apprehensions <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> {{the life}} <b>I</b> had led {{with the utmost}} {{contempt}} and abhorrence. I blushed, and wondered at myself how I could act thus, how I could divest myself of modesty and honour, and prostitute myself for gain; and I thought, if ever it should please God to spare me this one time from death, {{it would not be}} possible that I should be the same creature again.|$|R
60|$|So we parted. So I entered--doubting nothing, foreboding nothing--on a {{scene in}} my life which <b>I</b> now <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> with unfeigned repentance and regret.|$|R
60|$|If I {{had spoken}} to Doctor Dormann as I had {{positively}} resolved to speak, he would, beyond all doubt, have forbidden the employment of Madame Fontaine's remedy; Mr. Keller would have died; and the innocent woman who had saved his {{life would have been}} suspected, perhaps even tried, on a charge of murdering him. I really trembled when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the terrible consequences which must have followed, if I had succeeded that morning in keeping myself awake.|$|R
500|$|Formby {{returned}} to Britain at Christmas and appeared in Dick Whittington at the Grand Theatre, Leeds for nine weeks, and then, in February 1947, {{he appeared in}} variety for two weeks at the London Palladium. Reviewing the show, The Times thought Formby was [...] "more than ever the mechanized perfection of naive jollity. His smile, though fixed, is winning, and his songs... are catchy". In September that year he went on a 12-week tour of Australia and New Zealand. On his return he was offered more film roles, but turned them down, saying [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> some of the films I've {{done in the past}} {{it makes me want to}} cringe. I'm afraid the days of being a clown are gone. From now on I'm only going to do variety". He began suffering increasing health problems including a gastric ulcer, and was treated for breathing problems from his heavy smoking. He finished the year in pantomime, appearing as Buttons in Cinderella at the Liverpool Empire Theatre, with Beryl playing Dandini.|$|E
500|$|While {{writing the}} album, Wentz drew lyrical {{inspiration}} from rapper Lil Wayne, whom he called [...] "the best lyricist of [...]" [...] Speaking of Infinity on Highs lyrical themes, Wentz stated, [...] "On the last record, the lyrics were about 'This is where we're {{going to be}} a year from now, and this is what you're going to be saying about us.' But this time, we realized that a lot of bands should spend less time running their mouths and more time writing their songs." [...] In 2013, Wentz reflected, [...] "on a record like Infinity on High, I feel like I tried really hard to explain my perspective – and when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> it in hindsight I think it’s an extremely unrelatable record. Critics felt that much of the lyrics address the band's rise to fame and the pressure of maintaining a loyal fanbase. Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker commented that [...] "The only top-ten acts that talk about fame as much as Fall Out Boy does are rappers, although their take on selling records is less conflicted." [...] Cory Apar of Allmusic opined that [...] "Wentz' lyrics are oftentimes resentful, full of fame-induced angst, and really emphasize his need to drive home his position that stardom has not changed the band." ...|$|E

60|$|I came to London {{the next}} day after we parted, but did not go {{directly}} to my old lodgings; but for another nameless reason took a private lodging in St. John's Street, or, as it is vulgarly called, St. Jones's, near Clerkenwell; and here, being perfectly alone, I had leisure {{to sit down and}} reflect seriously upon the last seven months' ramble I had made, for I had been abroad no less. The pleasant hours I had with my last husband <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> with an infinite deal of pleasure; but that pleasure was very much lessened when I found some time after that I was really with child.|$|R

2500|$|In May 2013, {{asked about}} how {{he wanted to be}} remembered in his retirement, Beckham said, [...] "I just want people to see me as a hardworking footballer, someone that's passionate about the game, someone that – every time I stepped on the pitch – I've given {{everything}} that I have, because that's how I feel. That's how <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> it and hope people will see me." ...|$|E

On {{the subject of}} his time with the England team, Sidebottom said [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> my international career I have achieved more than I could ever have dreamed. I have had a truly fantastic period of my life with England. Winning the Twenty20 World Cup in the West Indies, my Test debut at Lords, a Test hat-trick against New Zealand, plus a Man of the Series award, {{are just a few of}} the highlights." ...|$|E

6000|$|I {{was feeling}} weak and {{depressed}} when I {{came down from}} London one November evening to the south coast: the sea, the clear sky, the bright colours of the afterglow kept me too long on the front in an east wind in that low condition, {{with the result that}} I was laid up for six weeks with a very serious illness. Yet when it was over <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> those six weeks as a happy time! Never had I thought so little of physical pain. Never had I felt confinement less--I who feel, when I am out of sight of living, growing grass, and out of sound of birds' voices and all rural sounds, that I am not properly alive! ...|$|R

I wish I had taken the game more serious because I know I {{could have done a}} lot better. But I do have the memories. A lot of guys I played with and against are now scouts for major league teams and we stay in touch from time to time. I made a lot of friends and had a lot of fun."

2500|$|An often {{overlooked}} literary influence on Kerouac was James Joyce, whose work he alludes {{to more than}} any other author. Kerouac had high esteem for Joyce and he often used [...] Joyce's stream-of-consciousness technique. Regarding On the Road, he {{wrote in a letter to}} Ginsberg, [...] "I can tell you now as <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the flood of language. It is like Ulysses and should be treated with the same gravity." [...] Additionally, Kerouac admired Joyce's experimental use of language, as seen in his novel Visions of Cody, which uses an unconventional narrative as well as a multiplicity of authorial voices.|$|E
2500|$|Kyle MacLachlan says Dylan McDermott was {{the first}} choice for the {{character}} of Zack Carey, but he declined and MacLachlan was then cast. The actor later recalled, [...] "That was a decision {{that was sort of}} a tough one to make, but I was enchanted with Paul Verhoeven. Particularly Robocop, which I loved. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> it now and it’s a little dated, but it’s still fantastic, and I think it’s got some of the great villains of all time in there. It was Verhoeven and [...] Eszterhas, and it seemed like {{it was going to be}} kind of dark and edgy and disturbing and real." ...|$|E

60|$|Now we had met {{but to be}} parted {{again by}} death, which seemed hard indeed. Yet since we had met, for my part Fate had my {{forgiveness}} for I knew that we should meet again. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> what <b>I</b> had done and left undone, and could not blame myself overmuch. True, {{it would have been}} wiser if I had stayed by Irene and Heliodore, and not led that charge against the Greeks. Only then, as a soldier, I should never have forgiven myself, for how could I stand still while my comrades fought for me? No, no, I was glad I had led the charge and led it well, though my life must pay its price. Nor was this so. I must die, not because I had lifted sword against Irene's troops, but for the sin of loving Heliodore.|$|R
60|$|About noon we sailed for Clovelly. Our smooth passage {{across the}} {{magnificent}} Bay of Bideford is the recollection of our happy voyage which <b>I</b> find myself <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> most admiringly while I now write.|$|R
2500|$|In 1813 and 1814, Harris was {{attached}} to the 8th Veteran's Battalion based in London, having been rejected from foreign service by the Duke of Wellington, who decreed no survivors of Walcheren were to serve in his army as none were fit for marching or fighting. There he served alongside several detachments of French deserters, again witnessing the frequent brutal punishment of the day, when a man was given 700 lashes for desertion. Stricken with illness, he was unable to rejoin his regiment during the Hundred Days Campaign and thus forfeited his pension. Nonetheless, Harris’ final words on the subject are very revealing. [...] "I enjoyed life more whilst on active service than I have ever done since, and <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> my time spent on the fields of the Peninsula as the only part worthy of remembrance".|$|E
2500|$|It {{says in the}} Akathist that St. Herman envisioned [...] "an Episcopal throne in this land."

[...] There were pan-Orthodox celebrations; Sunday of Orthodoxy gatherings were major events and the spirit of the faithful and clergy was elevated in this gathering of the Church. [...] Now we look back just ten years later and find the gathering of bishops at Ligonier is hailed as the greatest event of American Orthodoxy! [...] I wonder how the canonization of America's first saint is relegated to some lesser place in the life of Orthodoxy in America. [...] Even Ligonier was hopeful {{to those of us who}} were serving the churches in multiple jurisdictions. [...] Soon we were disappointed when hierarchs removed their names from the documents that were prepared; one on evangelism and the other on administrative unity.|$|E
2500|$|However, Powell {{lost his}} seat in the {{election}} by 731 votes to the Social Democratic and Labour Party's Eddie McGrady, mainly because of demographic and boundary changes that resulted in there being many more Irish Nationalists in the constituency than before. The boundary changes had arisen due to his own campaign {{for the number of}} MPs representing Northern Ireland to be increased to the equivalent proportion {{for the rest of the}} United Kingdom, as part of the steps towards greater integration. McGrady paid tribute to Powell, recognising the respect he was held by both Unionists and Nationalists in the constituency. Powell said, [...] "For the rest of my life when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the 13 years I shall be filled with affection for the Province and its people, and their fortunes will never be out of my heart". He received a warm ovation from the mostly Nationalist audience and as he walked off the platform, he said the words Edmund Burke used on the death of candidate Richard Coombe: [...] "What shadows we are, what shadows we pursue". When a BBC reporter asked Powell to explain his defeat, he replied: [...] "My opponent polled more votes than me".|$|E

I often reflected how my lover at the Bath, struck at the hand of God, repented and abandoned me, and refused to see me any more, though he loved me to an extreme; but I, prompted by that worst of devils, poverty, returned to the vile practice, and made the advantage {{of what they call}} a handsome face to be the relief to my necessities, and beauty be a pimp to vice.|$|R
