We can simplify this relationship using an abstraction layer of cyclic motor outputs corresponding to different kinds of locomotion.

40|$|A CTAS/FMS {{integration}} {{project at}} Ames Research Center addresses extensions to the CTAS {{air traffic management}} concept, among them the introduction of arrival routes specially designed for the use with a Flight Management System. These FMS arrival routes shall allow {{for the use of}} the INS' lateral and vertical navigation capabilities throughout the arrival until final approach. For the use in this project CTAS controller support tools that compliment the concept have been created. These tools offer controllers access to CTAS' prediction and planning capabilities in terms of speed and route advisories. The objective is to allow for a more strategic way of controlling aircraft. Expected benefits are an increase in arrival rate and a reduction of average travel times through TRACER airspace. A real time simulation is being conducted at Ames to investigate how FMS arrivals and approach transitions - with and without the support of CTAS tools - effect the flow of arriving traffic within TRACER airspace and the controllers' task performance. Four conditions will be investigated and compared to today's technique of controlling traffic with tactical vectoring: 1. FMS arrivals and approach transitions are available for controllers to issue to equipped aircraft - traffic permitting; 2. Speed advisories that match CTAS' runway balancing and sequencing plan are displayed to Feeder controllers; 3. Approach transition advisories (e. g., location of the base turn point) are displayed to <b>Final</b> <b>controllers</b> for tactical clearances ("Turn base now"); and 4.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we present}} the {{synthesis}} of a robust controller for uncertain discrete systems. The synthesis method of such a robust controller is the generalization of the Loop Shaping Design Procedure (LSDP) approach of McFarlane and Glover in the discrete case {{based on the work}} of Gu et al. We exploit the bilinear transform known as Tustin’s method in order to formulate the discrete loop shaping technique. A discrete weighting filter and a shaped discrete plant result from this technique. By taking into account the coprime factor uncertainty representation for the resulting shaped plant and by applying the small gain theorem, we define the concept of the robust stabilization of the discrete LSDP approach. This concept is based on the resolution of an optimization problem characterized by the maximum stability margin for {{the synthesis of}} the robust controller. To calculate the robust controller we transform this problem to a standard robust Formula controller design based on the resolution of the Riccati equations. Also, we present the gap metric theory to characterize the controller’s robustness. We note that the resulting <b>final</b> <b>controller</b> is the combination of the discrete weighting filter and the robust controller.
