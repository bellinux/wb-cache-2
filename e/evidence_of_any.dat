5|$|Crystal Palace's two Dicynodon {{models are}} based on {{incomplete}} Permian fossils found in South Africa, along with Owen's guess that they were similar to turtles. There is no <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> shelled Dicynodon, and recent more complete fossils show that they looked more like Hippopotamus.|$|E
5|$|Most {{academic}} sources {{maintain that}} the associations made between world events and Nostradamus's quatrains are largely the result of misinterpretations or mistranslations (sometimes deliberate) or else are so vague as to render them useless as <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> genuine predictive power.|$|E
60|$|It {{was nearly}} three o'clock before he {{returned}} to the cabin with the few tools that he had gathered. When he did so, he found Olly awaiting him, with a slight flush of excitement on her cheek, but no visible <b>evidences</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> late employment to be seen in the cabin.|$|R
50|$|No visible <b>evidence</b> remains <b>of</b> <b>any</b> early kitchen house, {{probably}} timber, {{associated with}} the 1863 building.|$|R
60|$|There were no <b>evidences</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> struggle, no {{overturned}} chairs or disarranged furniture. The grate {{was full}} of fluttering ashes of burnt paper, and the easy chair near the fire had evidently been used. On the floor was a handkerchief, a little morsel of lace. Anna saw it, {{and for the first}} time found herself trembling.|$|R
5|$|The pied butcherbird {{is listed}} as being a species of least concern by the IUCN, on account of its large range and stable population, with no <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> {{significant}} decline.|$|E
5|$|Irene was Johnson's only play, and {{was first}} {{performed}} on 6 February 1749 in a production {{by his friend}} and former pupil, David Garrick. The play was a commercial success and earned Johnson more money than anything else he had written up to that point. It was never revived during his lifetime, {{and there is no}} subsequent <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> other full-scale productions of Irene anywhere until 1999, {{making it one of the}} most unsuccessful plays ever written by a major author.|$|E
5|$|Mitcham Cricket Club {{was formed}} in 1685, the club playing on what is today known as Mitcham Cricket Green. The site has hosted cricket matches ever since. Mitcham is {{believed}} to be the world's oldest cricket club as there is no <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> club being founded before 1685. Croydon, Dartford and London had all been founded by the 1720s but their dates of origin have been lost, although there was an actual reference to a London Club in 1722.|$|E
50|$|Of {{fracture}} surfaces examined, none {{showed signs}} of fatigue but were caused by stress overload {{at the moment of}} impact. There was no abnormality with engine function in the moments before the crash and no <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> failure <b>of</b> <b>any</b> aircraft system.|$|R
6000|$|... "That," [...] said Barbara, with a {{trace of}} dryness, [...] "is a {{question}} you can answer best, though I saw no especial <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> activity <b>of</b> <b>any</b> kind. The question is--Can you do nothing better still? This province needs big bridges and daringly-built roads." ...|$|R
40|$|A {{fractured}} kinematic linkage of {{the landing}} gear assembly of an aircraft was analyzed. Fractographic features suggest that the linkage has failed by tensile overload. The material of the linkage {{was found to be}} Cr-Mn steel. There were no <b>evidences</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> delayed failure such as fatigue. The reason for excessive load on the linkage in question has to be established and corrective measures incorporated to prevent the recurrence of similar failure...|$|R
5|$|The {{garden warbler}} {{has a very}} large range of 9,650,000km2 (3,700,000mi2), and its {{population}} in Europe is estimated at 17–31million breeding pairs. Allowing for birds breeding in Asia, the total population is between 54–124million individuals. There is no <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> serious decline in numbers, so it is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern.|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> visits by eminent {{people to the}} castle, {{although}} there is a belief that in 1207 KingJohn visited and donated £5 towards the upkeep of its chapel. EdwardII certainly visited the castle and was there for three days in November 1323, during which time he also visited Norton Priory.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} central bank {{interventions}} on the US dollar and Deutsche mark found only limited <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> substantial effect on deviations from UIRP. UIRP {{has been found}} to hold over very small spans of time (covering only a number of hours) with a high frequency of bilateral exchange rate data. Tests of UIRP for economies experiencing institutional regime changes, using monthly exchange rate data for the US dollar versus the Deutsche mark and the Spanish peseta versus the British pound, have found some evidence that UIRP held when US and German regime changes were volatile, and held between Spain and the United Kingdom particularly after Spain joined the European Union in 1986 and began liberalizing capital mobility.|$|E
40|$|Examination {{revealed}} {{that both the}} cone bearings sent for investigation had mechanical damages at localized regions on the cage. The damages were caused by impact with a solid object. With the information provided, {{it was not possible}} to establish what exactly had caused the damage. The hardness and the microstructure of the bearing elements were found satisfactory and there were no abnormalities in the bearings. Also, there were no <b>evidences</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> heat effects...|$|R
30|$|A {{study was}} {{assessed}} {{to have a}} moderate level <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> if <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the above criteria were not met. On the other hand, the study was assessed not to have deficits that are described below for studies with a low level <b>of</b> <b>evidence.</b>|$|R
25|$|It has {{not been}} found to be {{effective}} for the treatment <b>of</b> <b>any</b> disease. The 2008 Trick or Treatment book said that no <b>evidence</b> exists <b>of</b> <b>any</b> beneficial effects <b>of</b> cupping for <b>any</b> medical condition.|$|R
5|$|Engines and {{propellers}} numbers 1 to 3 suffered substantial {{damage in}} the crash, but engine and propeller number 4 suffered much less damage. The investigators determined {{that at the time}} of impact, propellers 1, 2 and 3 were turning normally and their engines were producing power but propeller number 4 was feathered and its engine was not operating. There was also some evidence that action was taken by the crew to unfeather propeller number 4 in the moments before impact. None of the engines contained <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> internal failure prior to impact. All the magnetos were tested and the results indicated normal ignition was available to all engines up to the time of impact.|$|E
5|$|Programs {{encouraging}} sexual abstinence do {{not appear}} to affect subsequent HIV risk. <b>Evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> benefit from peer education is equally poor. Comprehensive sexual education provided at school may decrease high risk behavior. A substantial minority of young people continues to engage in high-risk practices despite knowing about HIV/AIDS, underestimating their own risk of becoming infected with HIV. Voluntary counseling and testing people for HIV does not affect risky behavior in those who test negative but does increase condom use in those who test positive. It is not known whether treating other sexually transmitted infections is effective in preventing HIV.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific swift has a {{very large}} range, {{exceeding}} 10,000,000km2 (3,800,000mi2). Its population is unknown, although it is common throughout its breeding range with no <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> decline. It is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern. There appear to be no significant threats to this bird; predation is low, and this swift is not tied to a particular habitat. Some birds may die through misadventure or become exhausted when lost on migration (the first record for the Western Palaearctic was found resting on a North Sea gas platform), but swifts have high survival rates and are generally long-lived. The common swift, a close relative of the Pacific swift, has been recorded as reaching 21years old.|$|E

"He habitually dined well, {{at a good}} restaurant; he {{had many}} trivial love-affairs, which were sensual but not passionate; he was {{exceedingly}} quarrelsome and unusually avaricious. ... It {{is hard to find}} in his life <b>evidences</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> virtue except kindness to animals ... In all other respects he was completely selfish. It is difficult to believe that a man who was profoundly convinced of the virtue of asceticism and resignation would never have made any attempt to embody his convictions in his practice." ...|$|R

5000|$|MacFarlane went on {{to testify}} {{in front of the}} United States Congress that she {{believed}} there was an organized, nationwide conspiracy of individuals and [...] "orthodox satanic groups" [...] sexually abusing children, although she never presented <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> who <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the individuals are nor proof <b>of</b> <b>any</b> orthodox satanic groups.|$|R
5|$|The {{political}} {{context of the}} event, coupled {{with a variety of}} curious circumstances (for instance, the Russian agent Kim Philby was head of counter-intelligence for MI6 in Gibaltar at the time), immediately gave rise to numerous speculation that Sikorski's death had been no accident, and may have been the direct result of a Soviet, British, or even Polish conspiracy. Some modern sources note that the accident is not fully explained However, as Roman Wapiński noted in his biographical entry on Sikorski in the Polish Biographical Dictionary in 1997, no conclusive <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> wrongdoing has been found, and Sikorski's official cause of death is listed as an accident.|$|E
5|$|There is no <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> direct Norwegian rule in {{the area}} other than a few brief occupations {{although}} the written record is weak and no contemporary records of the Norse period from the Outer Hebrides exist. It is however known that Hebrides were taxed using the Ounceland system and evidence from Bornais suggests that settlers {{there may have been}} more prosperous than families of a similar status in the Northern Isles, possibly due to a more relaxed political regime. Latterly, the Hebrides sent eight representatives from Lewis and Harris and Skye and another eight from the southern Hebrides to the Tynwald parliament on Man.|$|E
5|$|While abbot, Foliot {{supervised}} {{the acquisition of}} a dependent priory {{in the city of}} Hereford for the monastery. Most of the abbey buildings predate Foliot's time as abbot, and there is no sure <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> buildings he added to the monastery. During his abbacy, a dispute that had dragged on between Gloucester and the Archdiocese of York over some manors was finally settled in Gloucester's favour. This was done with a group of forged charters that Foliot may have helped to create. Forging charters was a common practice in English monasteries of the time. Foliot also had disputes with the Welsh bishop Uhtred, Bishop of Llandaff, over Goldcliff Priory and a church in Llancarfan, concerning tithes and new chapels that had been built without Gloucester Abbey's permission.|$|E

50|$|According to Godwin, James or John Cary, {{bishop of}} Lichfield and Goventry, succeeded bishop Gatrik in Exeter; {{but there is}} no <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> this, <b>any</b> more than <b>of</b> his having been bishop of Lichfield and Coventry.|$|R
50|$|Cupping {{is poorly}} {{supported}} by scientific evidence. In their 2008 book Trick or Treatment, Simon Singh and Edzard Ernst write that no <b>evidence</b> exists <b>of</b> <b>any</b> beneficial effects <b>of</b> cupping for <b>any</b> medical condition. A 2011 review found tentative evidence for pain but nothing else.|$|R
5|$|During the Kingdom, the Senate {{consisted}} of persons selected {{to the position}} by the King, a power which the consuls inherited {{after the end of}} the monarchy. In the very early republic, senators were primarily chosen due to their birth, but by the late Republic, and especially after Sulla, membership in the Senate became predicated on having previously held a magistracy. In the late 4th century BC, the consul's power to control Senate membership was transferred to the censor, exercised with considerable discretion, until laws passed in the late Republic formalised some kind of hearing before censorial decisions. In line with the censor's duty to protect morals, senators were required to be of good character, not have been found guilty of a criminal offence, and not be a person tainted with ignominy (e.g. bankrupts, former gladiators, prostitutes, or deserters). Before the time of Augustus, there is no <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> kind of property qualification. The Senate {{consisted of}} around 300 prior to the dictatorship of Sulla, but after his dictatorship, it consisted of somewhere over 500 men.|$|E
