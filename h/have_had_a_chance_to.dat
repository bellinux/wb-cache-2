5|$|In {{the first}} round, Teixeira {{connected}} with a head kick for three points. He delivered another blow to Atias' head in the second round, bringing the score to 8:0. Atias' coach got the score adjusted to 7:0 after a discussion with the judges. Teixeira's success continued, scoring 16 total points {{by the end of}} the third round. Atias' only scored two points after being penalized for an illegal kick to the legs. Atias lost in the round of 16 against Venilton Teixeira from Brazil by point gap of 2–16. Atias would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> compete for the bronze medal if Teixeira reached the finals, however he failed to do so and therefore Atias was eliminated from competition.|$|E

25|$|Private treaty sales – Occasionally, {{when looking}} at an auction {{catalogue}} {{some of the items}} have been withdrawn. Usually these goods have been sold by 'private treaty'.

25|$|At this point, {{the growing}} tide of {{revolution}} was becoming discernible, giving Hoveyda {{ample opportunity to}} leave the country before revolutionary forces could <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> overthrow the 2500-year-old monarchy. Aside from persistent efforts by family and friends {{to leave the country}} as quickly as possible, the Shah himself proposed Hoveida with an ambassadorial position to Belgium. His refusal to leave the country can be judged as being a result of naïveté or blind optimism, but Hoveida's decision can also be assessed from alternate angles. For one, {{he did not want to}} abandon his mother who was incapable of traveling at the time. On a more personal level, Hoveyda came to the conclusion that after years of self-exile, he would do all he could to remain in Iran. With all these points of rationale being considered, Hoveida actually came to believe that revolutionary fervour was capable of being contained and that everything would eventually straighten out, allowing the country to resume its present course.|$|E
25|$|By the 1580s, whaling was in decline, as ships {{returned}} to port half empty. This decade also {{coincided with the}} period when the king needed Spanish Basque ships for his armadas. The trade was particularly affected in 1586, 1587, and 1588, when Spanish Basque ships and sailors were detained {{in preparation for the}} 1588 armada against England. The threat of such detentions continued to undermine Spanish Basque whaling into the 1590s and early 1600s. Although whale stocks may <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> increase in the 1590s and early 1600s with the diminution of the Spanish Basque fleet, it appears the French Basques may have taken up the slack of their counterparts of northeastern Spain. In April 1602, Saint-Jean-de-Luz alone sent seven ships to carry out whaling in Terranova. Other factors, such as attacks by hostile Inuit (which, according to parish records, resulted in at least three instances of fatalities between 1575 and 1618), piratical attacks by the English and Dutch, and the opening of the Spitsbergen fishery (see below) may have also played a part in the decline.|$|E

The actor said [...] "I like the psychology, and I like the thinking {{that went into the}} episode as a viewer. As an actor, I felt like an opportunity passed me by. If I had to do any episode over again, it would be that one." [...] The actor called the episode in 1995 the greatest missed opportunity they had. Chris Carter disagreed, stating that Fox Mulder's role in the episode was the right way to do it, and that the dramatic weight for the episode had to shift from Mulder to Dana Scully.|$|E

[...] Prior to the album's release, Usher was put under the management of Grace Miguel—whom he is in a relationship with—replacing Randy Phillips, who managed Usher for a short period after he split with his mother, Jonnetta Patton for a second time, in 2008. The cover art and track listing for both the standard and deluxe edition of the album were revealed on May 3, 2012. On June 4, 2012, 30 second snippets of each track were leaked on the internet.|$|E
500|$|Diarmaid Ferriter {{selected}} {{the book as}} his pick in The Sunday Business Post feature [...] "Authors' choices". Ferriter commented: [...] "Rogan has to be admired for his perseverance and determination {{when it comes to}} chronicling {{the life and times of}} contrary musical giants – having previously tackled Morrissey. Well-researched biography is always to be encouraged, particularly when dealing with a difficult and elusive character". David Sinclair, author of Wannabe: How The Spice Girls Reinvented Pop Fam, reviewed the book for The Guardian, and commented: [...] "Rogan's scrutiny of Morrison's work is undertaken with no less care than that devoted to the details of the singer's life story, and the analysis and appreciation of Morrison's very real accomplishments as a musician provide some welcome ballast to a personal portrayal that is otherwise almost comically unflattering. Rogan's book certainly sheds new light on the life and times of this puzzling and reclusive performer." [...] Sinclair also noted the book takes a negative tone towards some of Morrison's mannerisms, and concluded his review with: [...] "But it may be as well to get hold of a copy before Morrison's legal representatives <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> get out their fine-tooth combs." ...|$|E

Leykis later reflected on his comparative lack of success in the New York market, explaining that the station never truly got behind him, [...] "We were talking to [...] about the show being on the station on a regular basis.

2500|$|Gordon Dahlquist of The Kubrick FAQ {{argues that}} the name change [...] "deliberately mirrors Jack Torrance being both the husband of Wendy/father of Danny and the mysterious man in the July Fourth photo. It is to say he is two people: the man with choice in a perilous {{situation}} {{and the man who}} has 'always' been at the Overlook. It's a mistake to see the final photo as evidence that the events of the film are predetermined: Jack has any number of moments where he can act other than the way he does, and that his (poor) choices are fueled by weakness and fear perhaps merely speaks all the more to the questions about the personal and the political that The Shining brings up. In the same way Charles had a chance – once more, perhaps – to not take on Delbert's legacy, so Jack may <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> escape his role as 'caretaker' to the interests of the powerful. It's the tragic course of this story that he chooses not to." [...] Dahlquist's argument is that Delbert Grady, the 1920s butler, and Charles Grady, the 1970s caretaker, rather than being either two different people or the same are two 'manifestations' of a similar entity; a part permanently at the hotel (Delbert) and the part which is given the choice of whether to join the legacy of the hotel's murderous past (Charles), just as the man in the photo is not exactly Jack Torrance, but nor is he someone entirely different. Jack in the photo has 'always' been at the Overlook, Jack the caretaker chooses {{to become part of the}} hotel. The film's assistant editor Gordon Stainforth has commented on this issue, attempting to steer a course between the continuity-error explanation on one side and the hidden-meaning explanation on the other; [...] "I don't think we'll ever quite unravel this. Was his full name Charles Delbert Grady? Perhaps Charles was a sort of nickname? Perhaps Ullman got the name wrong? But I also think that Stanley did NOT want the whole story to fit together too neatly, so [...] absolutely correct, I think, to say that 'the sum of what we learn refuses to add up neatly'." ...|$|E

2500|$|Powell {{donated the}} maximum {{allowable}} amount to John McCain's {{campaign in the}} summer of 2007 and in early 2008, his name was listed as a possible running mate for Republican nominee McCain's bid during the 2008 U.S. presidential election. However, on October 19, 2008, Powell announced his endorsement of Barack Obama during a Meet the Press interview, citing [...] "his ability to inspire, because of the inclusive nature of his campaign, because he is reaching out all across America, because of who he is and his rhetorical abilities", in addition to his [...] "style and substance." [...] He additionally referred to Obama as a [...] "transformational figure". Powell further questioned McCain's judgment in appointing Sarah Palin as the vice presidential candidate, stating that {{despite the fact that she}} is admired, [...] "now that we <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> watch her for some seven weeks, I don't believe she's ready to be president of the United States, which is the job of the vice president." [...] He said that Obama's choice for vice-president, Joe Biden, was ready to be president. He also added that he was [...] "troubled" [...] by the [...] "false intimations that Obama was Muslim." [...] Powell stated that [...] " [...] is a Christian—he's always been a Christian... But the really right answer is, what if he is? Is there something wrong with being a Muslim in this country? The answer's no, that's not America." [...] Powell then mentioned Kareem Rashad Sultan Khan, a Muslim American soldier in the U.S. Army who served and died in the Iraq War. He later stated, [...] "Over the last seven weeks, the approach of the Republican Party has become narrower and narrower [...] I look at these kind of approaches to the campaign, and they trouble me." [...] Powell concluded his Sunday morning talk show comments, [...] "It isn't easy for me to disappoint Sen. McCain in the way that I have this morning, and I regret that [...] I think we need a transformational figure. I think we need a president who is a generational change and that's why I'm supporting Barack Obama, not out of any lack of respect or admiration for Sen. John McCain." [...] Later in a December 12, 2008, CNN interview with Fareed Zakaria, Powell reiterated his belief that during the last few months of the campaign, Palin pushed the Republican party further to the right and had a polarizing impact on it.|$|E
