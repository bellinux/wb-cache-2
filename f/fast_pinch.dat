Presently Z pinches are the most intense laboratory X ray sources (1. 8 MJ in 5 ns from a volume 2 mm in diameter and 2 cm tall). Powers in excess of 200 TW have been obtained. This warrants summarizes the present knowledge of physics that governs the behavior of radiating current-carrying plasma in fast Z-pinches. This survey covers essentially all aspects of the physics of fast Z pinches: initiation, instabilities of the early stage, magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor instability in the implosion phase, formation of a transient quasi-equilibrium near the stagnation point, and rebound. Considerable attention is paid to the analysis of hydrodynamic instabilities governing the implosion symmetry. Possible ways of mitigating these instabilities are discussed. Non-magnetohydrodynamic effects (anomalous resistivity, generation of particle beams, etc.) are summarized. Various applications of <b>fast</b> Z <b>pinches</b> are briefly described.

40|$|Substantial {{evidence}} suggests that conceptual processing of manipulable objects is associated with potentiation of action. Such data have been viewed as evidence that objects are recognized via access to action features. Many objects, however, are associated with multiple actions. For example, a kitchen timer may be clenched with a power grip to move it but pinched with a precision grip to use it. The present study tested the hypothesis that action evocation during conceptual object processing is responsive to the visual scene in which objects are presented. Twenty-five healthy adults were asked to categorize object pictures presented in different naturalistic visual contexts that evoke either move- or use-related actions. Categorization judgments (natural vs. artifact) were performed by executing a move- or use-related action (clench vs. pinch) on a response device, and response times were assessed {{as a function of}} contextual congruence. Although the actions performed were irrelevant to the categorization judgment, responses were significantly faster when actions were compatible with the visual context. This compatibility effect was largely driven by <b>faster</b> <b>pinch</b> responses when objects were presented in use-compatible, as compared with move-compatible, contexts. The present study is the first to highlight the influence of visual scene on stimulus-response compatibility effects during semantic object processing.

40|$|Abstract. It {{has been}} shown that the quasi-equilibrium radius ratio of a <b>fast</b> compressional <b>pinch</b> is {{independent}} of the absolute magnitude of the driving current; it depends only on the current shape and on the length variation of the pinch during pinching. In this paper it is shown that a current step, switched on to the discharge current of a pinch as it approaches its quasi-equilibrium radius ratio as defined by a lossless energy balance theory, shifts the value of to a significantly lower value, thus enhancing pinch compression. It is proposed that this current-stepping technique may be used as a prelude to radiation cooling to eventually achieve the very small radius ratios required for a pinch fusion reactor. 1...|$|R

A comparison of the co- and countercurrent injected waves indicates that current drive (as opposed to heating) is responsible for the rotation profile modifications.

40|$|The linear-transformer-driver (LTD) is a {{recently}} developed pulsed-power technology that shows great promise {{for a number}} of applications. These include a Z-pinch-driven fission-fusion-hybrid reactor that is being developed by the Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics. In support of the reactor development effort, we are planning to build an LTD-based accelerator that is optimized for driving wire-array Z-pinch loads. The accelerator comprises six modules in parallel, each of which has eight series 0. 8 -MA LTD cavities in a voltage-adder configuration. Vacuum transmission lines are used from the interior of the adder to the central vacuum chamber where the load is placed. Thus the traditional stack-flashover problem is eliminated. The machine is 3. 2  m tall and 12  m in outer diameter including supports. A prototype cavity was built and tested for more than 6000 shots intermittently at a repetition rate of 0. 1  Hz. A novel trigger, in which only one input trigger pulse is needed by utilizing an internal trigger brick, was developed and successfully verified in these shots. A full circuit modeling was conducted for the accelerator. The simulation result shows that a current pulse rising to 5. 2  MA in 91  ns (10 %– 90 %) can be delivered to the wire-array load, which is 1. 5  cm in height, 1. 2  cm in initial radius, and 1  mg in mass.

40|$|Numerical {{calculations}} {{have been}} performed to investigate the role that load thickness may play {{in the performance of}} <b>fast</b> annular z <b>pinch</b> implosions. In particular, the effects of load thickness on the mitigation of the magnetically-driven Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability and energy coupling between the load and generator are addressed. using parameters representative of the Z accelerator [R. B. Spielman et al., Phys. Plasmas, 5, 2105 (1998) ] at Sandia National Laboratories, two dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations show that increased shell thickness results in lower amplitude, slightly longer wavelength RT modes. In addition, there appears to be an optimum in load velocity which is directly associated with the thickness of the sheath and subsequent RT growth. Thin, annular loads, which should couple efficiently to the accelerator, show a large reduction in implosion velocity due to extreme RT development and increased load inductance. As a consequence, thicker loads on the order of 5 mm, couple almost as efficiently to the generator since the RT growth is reduced. This suggests that z-pinch loads can be tailored for different applications, depending on the need for uniformity or high powers...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{conservation}} is currently {{one of the}} greatest challenges for chemical process industries world wide and especially in oil refineries and chemical industries. Reducing energy consumption and using energy more efficiently is becoming increasingly important, as the impact of energy use on the environment, and the need for reduced cost of production becomes vital. Utilizing Process Integration (PI) techniques for both new and retrofit plant designs enables the process engineer to create efficient energy recovery systems with lower production cost and improved environmental performance. Among the energy recovery systems, heat exchanger networks are of great importance. In process integration, heat exchanger networks are synthesized and retrofitted using two methods which are the Pinch Technology method and the Mathematical Programming method. Despite its success, conventional Pinch Technology methods face serious criticisms. Much of these criticisms related to the complexities in the resultant structure of the heat exchanger networks. The complexity in the network is brought about by the <b>fast</b> development in <b>Pinch</b> technology without taking into consideration the ease of plant operation. These complex HENs make the plant operators face difficulties in understanding where individual streams were going. The criticisms can be removed by decomposing the overall problem into a number of sub-problems associated with specific parts of the process under consideration. Decomposing the problem has major benefits; o It will allow the designer to produce energy-efficient network structures that are simple. o It will control piping costs and avoid the hazards associated with over-integration. o It will simplify the network design and retrofit processes. o It will avoid the need for sophisticated network-optimization procedures o It can be employed using any process-integration targeting software. This has implications for software vendors and purchasers In this study, the “Problem Decomposition” method (also called “Structural Targeting” method) based on Pinch Technology was applied to retrofit existing heat exchanger networks which were retrofitted using the traditional Pinch Technology retrofit method. The example networks were selected from published scientific papers. At {{the end of the study}} a comparison between the results of the two retrofit methods was made. Three case studies were selected for this purpose; a Crude Distillation Unit and two Pulp & Paper plants. The heat exchanger networks of these plants were originally retrofitted using the traditional retrofit method. The results obtained after the application of the Problem Decomposition retrofit method to these case studies, showed much better results in the final retrofitted heat exchanger networks compared to the results that obtained by using the traditional method. The criteria on which the comparison was based are : • The amount of savings in hot utility consumption • The payback period on the capital investment due to the addition of new heat transfer area to the existing heat exchanger networks or due to the installation of new heat exchangers • The structure of the final retrofitted heat exchanger networks • The simplicity of the design phase and the ability of the designer to interact with the analysis and design phases during the retrofit design work...|$|R
