5|$|Enhanced {{geothermal}} systems (EGS) actively inject {{water into}} wells {{to be heated}} and pumped back out. The water is injected under high pressure to expand existing rock fissures to enable the water to freely flow in and out. The technique was adapted from oil and <b>gas</b> <b>extraction</b> techniques. However, the geologic formations are deeper and no toxic chemicals are used, reducing the possibility of environmental damage. Drillers can employ directional drilling to expand {{the size of the}} reservoir.|$|E
5|$|Each race {{relies on}} two {{resources}} {{to sustain their}} game economies and to build their forces: minerals and vespene gas. Minerals are needed for all units and structures, and are obtained by using a worker unit to harvest the resource directly from mineral nodes scattered around the battlefield. Players require vespene gas to construct advanced units and buildings, and acquire it by constructing a <b>gas</b> <b>extraction</b> building {{on top of a}} geyser and using worker units to extract the gas from it. In addition, players need to regulate the supplies for their forces to ensure that they can construct the number of units they need. Although the nature of the supply differs between the races—Terrans use physical supplies held in depots, Protoss use psionic energy channeled from their homeworld via pylons, and Zerg are regulated by the number of controlling overlord units present—the supply mechanic essentially works {{in exactly the same way}} for each race (just with differing impacts on gameplay), allowing players to create new units when there are sufficient resources to sustain them.|$|E
5|$|Houston is {{recognized}} worldwide for its energy industry—particularly {{for oil and}} natural gas—as well as for biomedical research and aeronautics. Renewable energy sources—wind and solar—are also growing economic bases in the city. The Houston Ship Channel is also {{a large part of}} Houston's economic base. Because of these strengths, Houston is designated as a global city by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network and global management consulting firm A.T. Kearney. The Houston area is the top U.S. market for exports, surpassing New York City in 2013, according to data released by the U.S. Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration. In 2012, the Houston–The Woodlands–Sugar Land area recorded $110.3billion in merchandise exports. Petroleum products, chemicals, and oil and <b>gas</b> <b>extraction</b> equipment accounted for roughly two-thirds of the metropolitan area's exports last year. The top three destinations for exports were Mexico, Canada, and Brazil.|$|E

50|$|The {{extraction}} {{and use of}} {{shale gas}} can affect the environment through the leaking of extraction chemicals and waste into water supplies, the leaking of greenhouse <b>gases</b> during <b>extraction,</b> and the pollution caused by the improper processing of natural gas. A challenge to preventing pollution is that shale <b>gas</b> <b>extractions</b> varies widely in this regard, even between different wells in the same project; the processes that reduce pollution sufficiently in one extraction {{may not be enough}} in another.|$|R

25|$|Mining {{operations}} can {{be grouped}} into five major categories {{in terms of}} their respective resources. These are oil and <b>gas</b> <b>extraction,</b> coal mining, metal ore mining, nonmetallic mineral mining and quarrying, and mining support activities. Of all of these categories, oil and <b>gas</b> <b>extraction</b> remains {{one of the largest in}} terms of its global economic importance. Prospecting potential mining sites, a vital area of concern for the mining industry, is now done using sophisticated new technologies such as seismic prospecting and remote-sensing satellites. Mining is heavily affected by the prices of the commodity minerals, which are often volatile. The 2000s commodities boom ("commodities supercycle") increased the prices of commodities, driving aggressive mining. In addition, the price of gold increased dramatically in the 2000s, which increased gold mining; for example, one study found that conversion of forest in the Amazon increased six-fold from the period 2003–2006 (292 ha/yr) to the period 2006–2009 (1,915 ha/yr), largely due to artisanal mining.|$|E
40|$|The coupled hydro-mechanical {{state in}} soils coming from consolidation/subsidence {{processes}} and undergoing plasticity phenomena is here evaluated {{by means of}} the subloading surface model. The most important feature of this theory is the abolition of the distinction between the elastic and plastic domains, as it happens in the conventional elastoplastic models. This means that plastic deformations are generated whenever there is a change in stress and a smoother elastoplastic transition is produced. The plasticity algorithm has been implemented in the PLASCON 3 D FE code, coupling hydro-thermo-mechanical fields within a saturated (locally partially saturated) porous medium subjected to external loads and water/gas withdrawals from deep layers (aquifers/reservoirs). The 3 D model has been first calibrated and validated against examples taken from the literature, and then subsidence analyses at regional scales due to <b>gas</b> <b>extractions</b> have been developed to predict the evolution of settlements and pore pressure in soils for long-term scenarios...|$|R
