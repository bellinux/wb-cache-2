5|$|Sheldon goes {{to get a}} haircut; {{his usual}} barber Mr. D'Onofrio is in a coma, so the barber's nephew Angelo (Peter Onorati) is there instead. Sheldon is uncomfortable with the {{situation}} and runs away. Later, he talks to his friends; Penny (Kaley Cuoco) offers to cut his hair while Raj (Kunal Nayyar) and Amy (Mayim Bialik) suggest other barbers. <b>He</b> <b>rejects</b> all of their ideas.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of lesser Hyksos kings in Egypt is currently debated. Ryholt {{has shown that}} a statement in Eusebius' epitome of the Aegyptiaca indicating that the Hyksos had vassals contains a corruption of Manetho's original text. Thus, <b>he</b> <b>rejects</b> {{the hypothesis that the}} 16th Dynasty comprised vassals of the Hyksos and maintains instead that it was a native Egyptian dynasty independently reigning over the Theban region between the fall of the 13th Dynasty and the advent of the 17th Dynasty.|$|E

5|$|Arjuna, {{one of the}} Pandavas, recollects a curse {{which could}} help him stay incognito for one year. In the past, Arjuna was felicitated by Indra, the king of deities for gaining the divine weapon, Pashupatastra, from Lord Shiva through {{dedicated}} devotion. The celestial dancer Urvashi {{falls in love with}} Arjuna but <b>he</b> <b>rejects</b> her advances as he considered her a motherly figure. Feeling insulted, Urvashi cursed him to lose his masculinity and turn into an eunuch. Indra arrived and asked Arjuna to treat this curse as a blessing in disguise as the 13th year is arriving. Taking this into account, Arjuna turns into a transgender dance teacher Brihannala.|$|E
5|$|Habermas {{argues that}} his ethical theory is an {{improvement}} on Kant's ethics. <b>He</b> <b>rejects</b> the dualistic framework of Kant's ethics. Kant distinguished between the phenomena world, {{which can be}} sensed and experienced by humans, and the noumena, or spiritual world, which is inaccessible to humans. This dichotomy was necessary for Kant because it could explain the autonomy of a human agent: although a human is bound in the phenomenal world, their actions are free in the intelligible world. For Habermas, morality arises from discourse, which is made necessary by their rationality and needs, rather than their freedom.|$|E
5|$|Stacey Branning (Lacey Turner), Danielle's {{best friend}} in Walford, is also deeply {{affected}} by the incident, which triggers her bipolar disorder. She becomes non-compliant with her medication, has sex with Ryan, and is raped and attacked by Archie at the launderette. She believes both men are planning to kill her and is involuntarily committed to hospital, where she befriends Becca Swanson (Simone James). Upon her return to Walford along with Becca, Stacey restarts a relationship with Bradley Branning (Charlie Clements) when <b>he</b> <b>rejects</b> his girlfriend Syd Chambers (Nina Toussaint-White) for her.|$|E

5|$|Briam tells Kamala {{to stay in}} her quarters, but Captain Picard {{allows her}} to travel {{throughout}} the ship, with the unaffected Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) as her escort. This results in a fight nearly breaking out in Ten Forward, when Kamala begins to interact with several miners. The Ferengi seek to bribe Briam to turn Kamala over to them, but <b>he</b> <b>rejects</b> their offer. As he leaves, they attack him, causing him to fall, hit his head, and lose consciousness. The Enterprise turns the Ferengi over to the nearest starbase to stand trial, but Briam is unable {{to participate in the}} ceremony. Kamala helps Picard to take on Briam's role, and the two become close. He seeks to resist her abilities and tells her to be herself, and she explains that the woman he wants her to be is who she actually is.|$|E
5|$|Fifield (Sean Harris) is a {{geologist}} on the Prometheus. After waking up, <b>he</b> <b>rejects</b> friendly overtures from Millburn and casts doubt on Shaw and Holloway's mission hypothesis. Fifield accompanies the expedition to an artificial structure and deploys his spectagraphs, which {{begin to develop}} a layout for the Juggernaut. When the expedition encounters a decapitated Engineer, Fifield abandons his research and leaves the group with Millburn following. They become lost, failing to rendezvous {{with the rest of}} the expedition who has left because of the storm, and find a mound of Engineer corpses and a hidden room containing the thawed, mutating black liquid. They also encounter Hammerpedes: extraterrestrial, eel-like creatures which attack them. Fifield decapitates one, and its corrosive blood melts his helmet. The deformed and mutated Fifield returns to the Prometheus, where he attacks the crew and murders several members before he is killed.|$|E
5|$|He {{begins the}} section with an {{analysis}} of the temporal opening found in the skull of many extant birds. After a thorough comparison, <b>he</b> <b>rejects</b> the notion, which was common at the time, that this temporal opening was homologous with the supratemporal fenestra in reptiles. Instead, he concludes that it is a recent feature. Next he makes some observations on the wing structure of modern nestling birds. He finds that some species of extant birds have claws on their first and second fingers when very young, and some, like the hoatzin, will even use these temporary claws to climb about, including in the branches of trees. He also discovers that far more nestlings have a nonfunctional claw on the first digit, and some adult birds do as well.|$|E

5|$|He is {{critical}} of greed for gold, such as the absurdity of using the metal for coins in the early Republic. He gives examples of the way rulers proclaimed their prowess by exhibiting gold looted from their campaigns, such as that by Claudius after conquering Britain, and tells the stories of Midas and Croesus. He discusses why gold is unique in its malleability and ductility, far greater than any other metal. The examples given are its ability to be beaten into fine foil with just one ounce, producing 750 leaves four inches square. Fine gold wire can be woven into cloth, although imperial clothes usually combined it with natural fibres like wool. He once saw Agrippina the Younger, wife of Claudius, at a public show on the Fucine Lake involving a naval battle, wearing a military cloak made of gold. <b>He</b> <b>rejects</b> Herodotus's claims of Indian gold obtained by ants or dug up by griffins in Scythia.|$|E
5|$|Seeing the {{positive}} reception by the female audience, Glenda tries to convince Deke {{to join the}} Tex Warner Show. Driving in Deke's hotrod, she tells him about his potential. Not willing to leave his first steady job in a year, <b>he</b> <b>rejects</b> the offer, but Glenda asks him to think about it. Upon returning to town, Glenda calls the Highway Beverage Company, after which she and Tex quit the Tallman campaign {{to return to their}} own roadshow. Later that night, Deke is provoked at a restaurant by the boyfriend of one of his fans, who wants to hear him sing a song. After singing to a tune from the jukebox, he starts a fight with him. He is later exonerated by the police.|$|E
5|$|Sonya gives Rodya a cross {{when he goes}} to turn {{himself in}} and symbolizes the burden Raskolnikov must bear. Sonya tells him they will bear the cross {{together}} and is taking part of his burden onto herself, encouraging him to confess. Sonya and Lizaveta had exchanged crosses, so originally the cross was Lizaveta's—whom Rodya didn't intend to kill, making it an important symbol of redemption. Sonya's face reminds him of Lizaveta's face, another example of his guilty conscience and symbolizes a shared grief. Self-sacrifice, along with poverty, is a larger theme of the novel. The desperation of poverty creates a situation where the only way to survive is through self-sacrifice, which Raskolnikov consistently rejects, as part of his philosophical reasoning. For example, <b>he</b> <b>rejects</b> Razumikhin's offer of employment and the idea of his sister's arranged marriage. Raskolnikov originally rejects Sonya's offer to accompany him to the confession but, in a feverish state of mind, sees her following him through the market, and finds power in that idealism.|$|E

5|$|The name {{by which}} the series is known today is not Goya's own. His {{handwritten}} title on an album of proofs given to a friend reads: Fatal consequences of Spain's bloody war with Bonaparte, and other emphatic caprices (Spanish: Fatales consequencias de la sangrienta guerra en España con Buonaparte, Y otros caprichos enfáticos). Aside from the titles or captions given to each print, these are Goya's only known words on the series. With these works, he breaks {{from a number of}} painterly traditions. <b>He</b> <b>rejects</b> the bombastic heroics of most previous Spanish war art to show the effect of conflict on individuals. In addition he abandons colour in favour of a more direct truth he found in shadow and shade.|$|E
5|$|For {{several years}} on the series, a {{defining}} characteristic of Todd's personality was his resistance to close relationships and sexual intimacy, which were due to his mistreatment by others, especially his adoptive father, who may have raped {{him when he was}} fourteen. It was also due to his horrific past misdeeds, including his rape of Marty and dysfunctional aspects of his relationship with Blair. Surviving a near-death experience and being presumed dead in 1995 and, upon his return in 1996, finding Blair having sex with Patrick made Todd bitter; seeing Blair with another man sexually, soon after his presumed death, caused him to shut down emotionally. The writers made Todd's fear of intimacy into a prominent obstacle for his relationship with his second wife, Téa. When she at one point attempts to seduce Todd by stripping down naked {{in front of him and}} pleading with him to make love to her, <b>he</b> <b>rejects</b> her, explaining that he no longer trusts himself to be intimate in that way; he subsequently throws her out, practically naked, into the middle of a snowstorm.|$|E
5|$|Julius Seelye Bixler {{reviewed}} the book twice, in 1952 and 1953. In his first review {{he wrote that}} he believed Stace was trying to have his {{cake and eat it}} with regards to the truth of both naturalism and mysticism. Bixler also wonders whether the revelation of God can really be free of concepts and thus whether time and eternity are utterly unrelated as Stace maintains. He identifies points in Stace’s thought where there is continuity between these two states and mystical language does appear to refer to concepts. Finally <b>he</b> <b>rejects</b> the book’s analogy of mystical experience to the evocative power of art, maintaining that art must be somewhat related to logic. Nonetheless, Bixler does concur that the book is a fascinating confessio fidei and personal statement. A year later, he reviewed Time and Eternity alongside Religion and the Modern Mind. As well as reiterating the points he had made earlier, Bixler judges the second book more favourably and recommends reading the two together to better understand the problems they address.|$|E

His {{friendship}} with Donna Yates (Lisa Hammond) grows {{and they have}} a one-night stand, but, feeling it is making their friendship weird, <b>he</b> <b>rejects</b> her afterwards despite her thinking she might have deeper feelings for him. Things between them are awkward, and when Donna's foster brother Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood) finds out, he confronts Fatboy and locks him a cupboard. He returns the next day to find that Fatboy has not been discovered, and from how scared Fatboy is, realises something is wrong. Fatboy opens up about the fact his mother used to lock him up for extended periods of time, which led to him assuming the comedic persona of 'Fatboy'. Vincent convinces him to use his real name, Arthur, again, and gives him a job as DJ at his bar The Albert as long as he no longer puts on a false persona, starting with admitting to Donna that he will now be showing his true self to her.

Fatboy tells Dot {{that he is going to}} see his father for Christmas, and shares a final dinner with her before saying goodbye. He confronts Vincent one last time, demanding that he stay away from Dot, and leaves Walford.|$|E
