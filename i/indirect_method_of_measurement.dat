The conversion formula between these two different scattering based on two calibration curves is derived, which describes the quantitative relationship between acoustic and electromagnetic wave scattering at arbitrary frequencies by spheres of arbitrary sizes. In addition, the scaling relationship of the sizes of those two spheres and the corresponding frequencies are discussed in detail, and an <b>indirect</b> <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> of electromagnetic scattering by the spheres is proposed...|$|E
40|$|This study {{argues that}} an {{evaluation}} of the relationship between CEO turnover and corporate performance can be usefully approached in three steps. (1) An empirical longitudinal analysis of 88 German corporations which had experienced a change in CEO shows that different kinds of CEO turnover are associated with different developments in published performance during the succession period. (2) Using a structural equations model it is possible to demonstrate the aptness of a hypothesis on performance variation based on agency theory and using empirical data on involuntary CEO turnover.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of unrealistic optimism {{with regard to}} a genetic risk situation was investigated within a group of female adults (study 1) {{and a group of}} adolescents (study 2). In both studies, the <b>indirect</b> <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> elicited a significant optimistic bias. Contrary to Weinstein (1982, 1987) we found no relation between the direct or indirect measures of unrealistic optimism and personal experience with the risk, perceived frequency of occurrence or perceived preventability of the risk. Trait-Anxiety was significantly related to the extent of unrealistic optimism, but only when the direct measure was used. Together {{with the fact that the}} indirect measure resulted in a much stronger bias than the direct one, this suggests that there exists an important difference between both measures. Further research on the measurement of unrealistic optimism and on its determinants in specific risk situations is needed. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|An intense, low-frequency tone (about 30 Hz) modulates the {{sensitivity}} of the inner ear to high-frequency stimulation. This modulation is correlated with the displacement of the basilar membrane. The findings suggest that the modulation may also affect cochlear tuning. We have investigated modulation of cochlear tuning by low-frequency sound in the guinea pig. Applying <b>indirect</b> <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> (narrow-band analysis <b>of</b> compound action potentials and compound-action-potential tuning curves), the results suggest a shift of the excitation pattern along the basilar membrane towards higher-frequency areas. The shift occurred for both scala tympani and scala vestibuli displacement of the cochlear partition. Tuning curves, obtained from single units in the cochlear nerve, show sensitivity loss and a tip shift towards lower frequencies. This was also found for both scala tympani displacement and scala vestibuli displacement. The shift of the tip of the tuning curve towards lower frequencies corresponds to the inferred high-frequency shift of the excitation pattern. The relationship of these phenomena with the pathophysiology of Ménière's disease and with possible active mechanisms in cochlear transduction is discussed...|$|R

Therefore, the real-time technology {{is supported by}} <b>indirect</b> <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurements.</b> One such solution is the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> line-line intersection. Having determined the position (the coordinates) of the so-called base points on {{the extension of the}} wall faces of a building, and having calculated the coordinates of intersection of the lines of relationships between the base points, the coordinates of corners of a building structure are obtained, which are relatively unreliable. In order to increase the reliability of these coordinates, the author proposes to add an innovative solution called vector translation to the classical <b>method</b> <b>of</b> line-line intersection. This paper proves the thesis on the increased reliability of determining the coordinates of corners of buildings by conducting an appropriate mathematical analysis of these formulas, using the algorithm developed by the author.

40|$|Use of {{near-infrared}} reflectance spectroscopy in soil analysis. A review. This paper {{presents a}} literature review {{on the development}} of near infrared reflectance spectroscopy for soil analysis and the contribution of this technique to the evaluation of soil fertility analysis. This technique is used to estimate the chemical composition of soil samples {{on the basis of their}} absorption properties. It is therefore an <b>indirect</b> <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement,</b> which requires a calibration phase for the prediction of these properties. NIR spectroscopy offers many advantages compared to reference analysis: it is known to be a physical, non-destructive, rapid, reproducible and low cost method. Often employed in other analytical domains, such as agro-food, NIR spectroscopy has, however, seldom been used in soil characterization, due to the complexity of the soil matrix. Thanks to the development of chemometric methods, numerous studies have recently been conducted to evaluate the feasibility of the application of the technique in soil analysis. Most authors conclude that NIR spectroscopy is promising; however, to date, use of the technique has not spread to routine laboratories. The paper is organized as follows. Firstly, we provide an overview of the NIR spectroscopy technique and related chemometric methods. Secondly, we describe the soil characteristics that can be predicted using this technique. Finally, we detail examples of results that have been obtained through the use of the technique, mainly in the determination of clay and organic carbon content, and of cation exchange capacity...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 Satellite based {{observations}} {{are becoming more}} widespread for operational and decision making activities in water resources due to their near real-time availability as well as minimization of difficulties related to ground based hydrological measurements. In this study, two crucial hurdles to advance real-world operationalization of satellite datasets are addressed. First, a simple, easy-to-access, easy-to-build, robust and consistent open-source web portal is developed connecting complex models to facilitate satellite based observations by developing nations. Second, to enhance the predictability skill of satellite-based estimations, an innovative and dynamic web analytics-based correction system is developed to reduce the uncertainty related to <b>indirect</b> <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> by the satellites. The correction system comprised of precipitation correction and streamflow correction. In precipitation correction, web crawled precipitation from different sites of government agencies of South Asia region are used to estimate bias in satellite based precipitation. This dynamically bias adjusted precipitation is then used to simulate hydrological models to obtain streamflow. Simulated streamflow is corrected using discharge climatology and gauged discharge observations. These corrected datasets are finally shared through South Asian Surface Water Modelling System (SASWMS) web portal. On an average, these dynamic correction techniques reduced RMSE in streamflow by 80 - 90 %. The take-home message is that {{with the growth of}} open-source tools, it is now possible for any resource-constrained water management agency to build robust and cost-effective operational web portals based on satellite data and non-proprietary software. With dynamic correction features that can also be built from open-source tools, the well-known limitations of satellite-based operationalization can be overcome for water management agencies of developing countries...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the normal development of pituitary volume by means <b>of</b> direct <b>measurements</b> made on thin-section 3 D MR acquisitions. METHODS: The volume of the normal pituitary gland in children and adolescents was measured by using 3 D MR sequences with a section thickness of 0. 6 to 0. 75 mm. The clinical study group consisted of 199 pediatric patients with clinically normal pituitary function and no abnormal findings on routine MR studies. The volume of the posterior pituitary was also measured in all the subjects. RESULTS: A phantom study revealed measurement errors within 25 %. In the clinical study, the measured pituitary volumes showed a growth spurt during puberty, which was more prom-inent in girls. Posterior pituitary volumes showed gradual growth without such a spurt. Among 5 - to 9 -year-olds, the posterior pituitary volumes were significantly larger for boys than for girls.

Cover crop is largely used in viticultural areas based on the many positive agronomic and environmental benefits it provides. However, {{it is not clear}} what effect the cover crop can have on water use in the vineyard. This study is designed to develop a further understanding of the role cover crops play in total water use in the vineyard and develop our understanding of the potential use of cover crops as a water management tool. Two techniques were used to measure cover crop water use, the mini-lysimeters and a portable open chamber and data from both was compared to reference evapotranspiration (ETo) (FAO guidelines). While the mini-lysimeters seemed to be limited in their ability to accurately represent the water use of the surrounding soil, the open chamber method is a reliable and suitable instrument to be used for the accurate <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> evapotranspiration. Further, the relationship between vineyard grass water use and the contributing environmental factors thought to influence water use were analyzed.

40|$|Ziel: Nach einem Jahr dialektisch-behavioral orientierter Behandlung von Borderline Patienten im ambulanten Setting werden verschiedene Wirksamkeitskriterien und Therapieprozessvariablen, wie die Qualität der Therapieallianz aus Patientenperspektive untersucht. Methode: In einer naturalistischen Studie absolvierten 47 Borderline-Patienten eine DBT-orientierte Behandlung. Das Therapieergebnis wurde mittels indirekten und direkten Veränderungsmaßen, wie Patientenziele erfasst. Prozessvariablen wurden qualitativ mittels halbstrukturierter Interviews nach einem Jahr Therapie untersucht, wobei 28 Interviews in die Analyse einflossen. Speziell die Therapiebeziehung wurde zusätzlich quantitativ mit Hilfe des Working-Alliance-Inventory erfasst, welcher nach jeder Therapiesitzung erhoben wurde. Quantitative wie {{qualitative}} Analysen wurden integriert. Ergebnisse: Die meisten Patienten zeigten im Behandlungsverlauf Fortschritte innerhalb direkt, wie auch indirekt erhobener Therapieerfolgsmaße. Die Therapieallianz steht dabei in positivem Zusammenhang mit der Therapiezielerreichung und einigen BPS-relevanten Symptomen, nicht jedoch mit Reduktion von Selbstverletzung/Suizidalität. Die qualitativen Analysen der retrospektiv erlebten Wirkfaktoren zeigen hilfreiche und weniger hilfreiche Aspekte im Therapieverlauf, wobei Beziehungsfaktoren und Therapeutenvariablen durch die Patienten als besonders wichtig bewertet werden. Schlussfolgerung: Aus Patientenperspektive wird die Bedeutung der Therapieallianz hervorgehoben, die mit der Erreichung individuell definierter Therapieziele und der Reduktion einiger borderline-typischer Symptome in Verbindung steht. Die Therapieallianz wird aus Patientenperspektive vor allem durch therapeutische “Soft Skills”, wie Empathie, Selbstoffenbarung und Verständnis geformt. Darüber hinaus wird die Fähigkeit des Therapeuten, sich auf die Bedürfnisse des Patienten einzulassen und verschiedene DBT-spezifische Fertigkeiten vermitteln zu können betont. Objective: To {{investigate the}} patient`s perspective about the key mechanisms of change, especially {{the quality of}} the therapeutic alliance and to analyse different criteria of outcomes {{in the first year of}} out-patient dialectical behavioral therapy. Method: Participants were 47 outpatients diagnosed with BPD, who enrolled in a naturalistic trial of DBT. Severity of symptoms were assessed at intake and one year after beginning of treatment. Direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> were used, for example individual goals from patients perspective. Alliance was assessed with the Working-Alliance-Inventory for patient´s perspective for every session and in addition with a qualitative interview after one year for 28 persons of the sample. Furthermore the interview includes all more or less helpful aspects of the process of psychotherapy. The research integrates quantitative and qualitative methods. Results: Patients showed positive changes over the course of treatment measured with direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>methods.</b> Results indicate an association between alliance and some BPD symptoms and achievement of individual goals but not self-injurious acts or suicide attempt. The qualitative analysis supports differentiation between helpful and unhelpful aspects of the key mechanisms of change from patients perspective. In the client’s view, the strongest categories comprised relationship factors and therapist variables. Conclusions: Results emphasize the importance of a strong therapeutic alliance in the treatment of patients with BPD from patients perspective, but not consistently for the assessed outcomes. The alliance was experienced and formed mainly by the therapist’s “soft skills” such as empathy, self-disclosure and understanding. The therapist’s ability to attune to the client’s needs implied the use of a wide range of DBT-specific skills...|$|R

Twenty five patients undertook a graded bicycle exercise test, cycling at workloads increasing from 41, 65, 114, and 163 W (250 to 400, 700, and 1000 kpm per min) with each grade being maintained for three minutes unless the exercise test was terminated earlier {{at the point of}} fatigue. Intra-arterial pressures were recorded continuously and indirect measurements made at steady state levels in the 30 seconds before each change in grade and immediately after the termination of the exercise protocol. The mean difference in systolic blood pressure at 5. 5 minutes of exercise showed that the indirect measurement underestimated the direct measurement. Immediately after the termination of exercise the blood pressure fell precipitiously to a highly significant degree. For both systolic and diastolic pressures there was considerably individual variability.

Silicon deoxidates cast irons at lower temperatures, at higher temperatures this function is taken over by carbon. Logarithmic dependences of oxygen activity on temperature for individual graphite forms (lamellar, vermicular, and spheroidal ones) have been obtained. Determination of total oxygen content in cast iron on the other hand gives valuable information for controlling surface and internal quality of cast irons. Practical implications: Possibility of control the cast iron structure and graphitization during crystallization by monitoring the oxygen content with an <b>indirect</b> <b>method</b> <b>of</b> oxygen activity <b>measurement</b> in the melt before metal pouring the mould. Originality/value: The used method gives reproducible results which are comparable under different conditions of metal melting and pouring. Obtained knowledge extends the understanding in the field of cast irons crystallization by less known influence of oxygen...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} biological age on the physical performance of elite youth athletes, whilst validating current <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> measuring maturity levels. Methods: A sample of one hundred and ninety one male elite youth athletes participated in a <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> maturity using a direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>method</b> {{over the course of}} a season. Seventy-three of this focussed non-random sample of elite youth games players took part in the <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> !BUA (Broadband Ultrasound AtienGafiari) at the dald'a'rie'u"§ to idéñiif' skeletal thaturity and frovidé a ndrnátivC data set for this <b>method.</b> An <b>indirect</b> <b>method</b> <b>of</b> maturity <b>measurement</b> by Sherar ci al. (2005) involved a series <b>of</b> anthropometric <b>measurements</b> followed by various calculations to provide a normative data set. The zlationships between these two <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> biological maturity were identified using Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient. The tracking of physical performance {{over the course of a}} season involved a series of field'based tests that were recorded over three separate test occasions. Results: Anthropometric measurements indicated elite youth soccer lâ 9 ê to be en aVèPagè ialler (5. 91 àth) than a similar aged géhéial population, additionally these same athletes were found to have on average a greater body mass (6. 3 kg) than the same set of norm scales. A normative data set for the <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> BUA (dBIMHz) was generated ranging from 51. 64 - 85. 25 ± 8. 07 - 18. 85 (mean ± s. d.). Significant correlations were established between BUA and all Sherar determined values (p 0. 05). The profiling of physical performance against a similar aged population highlighted superior physical performance from the elite athletes. Vertical jump performance had a greater mean average of 8. 1 cm.

However, plateaus in performance were prevalent in most as the season progressed. Conclusions: Results found the Sherar method to be a useful tool to assess biological maturity in young athletes. The recording of physical performance over the course of a season indicated young elite athletes to have a superior level of skill and fitness than similar aged population norms. Comparisons also indicated these elite athletes to be on average taller and have a larger body mass than comparative norms...|$|R
40|$|Solid-State Fermentation (SSF) of Aspergillus niger FTCC 5003 on Palm Kernel Cake (PKC) is a {{practical}} approach to upgrade PKC into value added product. Present study was conducted on Aspergillus niger FTCC 5003 growth profile and models {{that are able to}} describe the growth in SSF using PKC substrate. Due to the difficulties of separating cell biomass quantitatively from the substrate for SSF systems, <b>indirect</b> <b>method</b> for <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> cell growth during SSF of PKC by Aspergillus niger FTCC 5003 was studied based on the estimation of glucosamine and protein content. Preliminary relationships between glucosamine and protein contents to fungal dry cell weight (D w) were developed using simulated homogenous SSF data using glass beads as support materials. Both glucosamine and protein contents were well correlated to the fungal dry cell weight in SSF on support materials for protein and glucosamine, respectively. The equations obtained were used for the estimation of cell biomass profile during SSF of PKC from the data of glucosamine and protein as growth indicator study. The estimated fungal dry cell weight based on protein concentration and Î²-mannanase activity as metabolic activity for microbial growth were well correlated to PKC dry weight which, indicating that both were suitable marker in describing the growth of A. niger FTCC 5003 in this system. In contrast, estimated fungal dry cell weight based on glucosamine concentration was not suitable to describe the growth of A. niger FTCC 5003...|$|R
40|$|Although peatlands {{cover only}} 3 % of the Earth’s surface, they {{constitute}} a huge reservoir of carbon. It {{is estimated that}} they accumulate one third of carbon contained in all types of soils worldwide. Therefore, knowledge of the physical, chemical, and biological properties of peat is important for prevention of peat degradation and release of carbon stored as CO 2 into the atmosphere. In organic soils, water plays {{a very important role}} as a protective factor against mineralisation of organic matter. Therefore, organic soils are characterised by high specificity and dissimilarity from mineral soils. The hydrological factor induces a variety of changes in the physical and chemical properties, e. g. low redox potential or low oxygen content in soil pores. Many soil processes are determined by the soil oxygenation status, which can be measured with various indicators as well as direct and indirect <b>measurements.</b> One <b>of</b> the <b>indirect</b> <b>methods</b> is <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> the redox potential. The oxidation-reduction potential (redox potential or Eh) {{is a measure of the}} ratio of oxidised to reduced forms in a solution. This parameter is inextricably linked to oxygen supply and the processes of consumption thereof by microorganisms and plant roots. Therefore, the redox potential is used as an indicator of the oxygenation status and the content of biogenic forms and toxins in the soil environment and sediments. In the case of submerged soils, penetration of atmospheric oxygen into the soil is limited due to low rates of oxygen diffusion and, hence, low redox potential, which inhibits plant growth through inhibition of respiration and production of toxins in reducing conditions. The aim of this article is (1) to the show soil-plant-soil microorganism interactions taking place on peatbogs in the context of redox potential, (2) to investigate the responses of plants and soil microorganisms to the changing redox potential, and (3) to demonstrate the mechanisms of plant adaptation to the reducing conditions prevailing in peatbogs...|$|R
