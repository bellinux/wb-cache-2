In October 1864, 984 of 7,402 prisoners were reported as sick in the barracks. Meanwhile, in November 1864, as repairs were being carried out, water was cut off to the camp and even to the hospital.

Operating funds were disbursed to all commuter operators and the Rock Island was to be provided with new equipment to replace the tired 2700 series and Capone cars. New Budd bilevels that were near copies of the 1961 Milwaukee Road cars arrived in 1978. New EMD F40PH units arrived in late 1977 and, in summer, 1978, briefly could be seen hauling Capone cars.

They went on to perform sold out concerts on November 17 at Osaka Big Cat and November 20 at Shibuya-AX, which Minato chose not to participate in.

25|$|In {{the late}} 1980s {{and until the}} mid 1990s, visual kei {{received}} increasing popularity throughout Japan, when album sales from visual kei bands started to reach record numbers. The most notable bands to achieve success during this period included X Japan, Buck-Tick and Luna Sea; however, a drastic change in their appearance accompanied their success. The first band whose recordings achieved a notable success was Dead End, whose independent album <b>Dead</b> <b>Line</b> (1986) sold over 20,000 copies, while major Ghost of Romance (1987) reached No. 14 on the Oricon albums chart. They even had two albums released by American label Metal Blade Records, however, Dead End and D'erlanger disbanded in 1990, and from the mid 1988s and 1989s Buck-Tick and X Japan started to gain mainstream success. In 1992, X Japan tried to launch an attempt to enter the American market, even signing with Atlantic Records for a US album, but this ultimately did not happen.|$|E

2500|$|In 1958, {{when most}} of the GS class engines had already been scrapped, a then black-and-silver painted 4449 was removed from storage and donated on April 24, 1958, to the city of Portland, Oregon, where it was placed on outdoor public display in Oaks Park. Since the {{equipment}} was considered obsolete, 4449 was not actively chosen for static display. It was picked simply {{because it was the first}} in the <b>dead</b> <b>line</b> and could be removed with the least number of switching moves. [...] During its time on display, 4449 was repeatedly vandalized and had many of its parts stolen, including its builder's plates and whistle. The locomotive quickly deteriorated due to neglect. It was evaluated for restoration in 1974 after becoming a candidate to pull the American Freedom Train. Its size, power, and graceful lines made it a good fit for the Bicentennial train. After finding that 4449's bearings and rods were in good shape, it was chosen.|$|E

50|$|A rugby league {{field is}} similar, {{it may be}} 112-122 by 68 metres (122.5-133.4 × 74.3 yards).

40|$|Abstract—Cache {{memories}} {{have traditionally}} been designed to exploit spatial locality by fetching entire cache lines from memory upon a miss. However, {{recent studies have shown}} that often the number of sub-blocks within a line that are actually used is low. Furthermore, those sub-blocks that are used are accessed only a few times before becoming dead (i. e., never accessed again). This results in considerable energy waste since 1) data not needed by the processor is brought into the cache, and 2) data is kept alive in the cache longer than necessary. We propose the Dead Sub-Block Predictor (DSBP) to predict which sub-blocks of a cache line will be actually used and how many times it will be used in order to bring into the cache only those sub-blocks that are necessary, and power them off after they are touched the predicted number of times. We also use DSBP to identify <b>dead</b> <b>lines</b> (i. e., all sub-blocks off) and augment the existing replacement policy by prioritizing <b>dead</b> <b>lines</b> for eviction. Our results show a 24 % energy reduction for the whole cache hierarchy when averaged over the SPEC 2000, SPEC 2006 and NAS-NPB benchmarks. I...|$|R

60|$|To {{relieve the}} monotony I {{had taken to}} fishing, and early that morning I had {{departed}} from the Coldwater {{in one of the}} boats on such an excursion. A gentle west wind was blowing.

6000|$|The stenographer and {{typewriter}} of the Acropolis Hotel (there! I've let {{the name}} of it out!) was Miss Ida Bates. She was a hold-over from the Greek classics. There wasn't a flaw in her looks. Some old-timer paying his regards to a lady said: [...] "To have loved her was a liberal education." [...] Well, even to have looked over the black hair and neat white shirtwaist of Miss Bates was equal to a full course in any correspondence school in the country. She sometimes did a little typewriting for me, and, as she refused to take the money in advance, she came to look upon me as something of a friend and protégé. She had unfailing kindliness and a good nature; and not even a white-lead drummer or a fur importer had ever dared to cross the <b>dead</b> <b>line</b> of good behaviour in her presence. The entire force of the Acropolis, from the owner, who lived in Vienna, down to the head porter, who had been bedridden for sixteen years, would have sprung to her defence in a moment.|$|E
