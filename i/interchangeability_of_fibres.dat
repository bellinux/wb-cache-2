40|$|<b>Interchangeability</b> <b>of</b> drug {{products}} {{has very}} different features with small molecules and with biologicals. With small-molecule drugs, {{a statement of}} bioequivalence generally indicates therapeutic equivalence and interchangeability. In contrast, with the much more sensitive and complicated biological drugs, a declaration of biosimilarity emphatically {{does not imply that}} a patient could be switched from one product to another. Both formulations may be prescribed and administered to subjects who have not received yet the drug in any of its forms. However, regulatory agencies have been very cautious about enabling and permitting interchangeability. Notably, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of the USA sets very formidable and severe conditions for enabling the <b>interchangeability</b> <b>of</b> biological drug products. The background and conditions for the <b>interchangeability</b> <b>of</b> both small-molecule and biologic drug products are presented in detail. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the <b>interchangeability</b> <b>of</b> paid and volunteer labor. It reports on estimates and prevalence <b>of</b> such <b>interchangeability</b> {{through a series of}} studies of Canadian nonprofits: two national surveys of nonprofit organizations and case studies of two hospitals. The first study found evidence that volunteers were replacing paid staff and that paid staff were replacing volunteers, sometimes in the same organization. The second study explored this pattern further and found the percentage of tasks that were interchangeable. The third study found that about two-thirds of the organizations in the sample agreed that the <b>interchangeability</b> <b>of</b> tasks occurred, but the data indicated that it was limited to about 12 % of tasks, not dissimilar to the estimates from the case studies. The implications of the results are discussed, and a model for the <b>interchangeability</b> <b>of</b> paid and volunteer labor is presented...|$|R

This results in an architecture based on open standards, allowing <b>interchangeability</b> <b>of</b> terminological systems, servers and clients...|$|R

2500|$|The {{industrial}} revolution was facilitated by two elements: <b>interchangeability</b> <b>of</b> parts and division of labor. Division of labor {{has always been}} a feature from the beginning of civilization, {{the extent to which the}} division is carried out varied considerably depending on period and location. Compared to the Middle Ages, the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery were characterized by a greater specialization in labor, one of the characteristics of growing European cities and trade. It was in the late eighteenth century that Eli Whitney popularized the concept <b>of</b> <b>interchangeability</b> <b>of</b> parts when he manufactured 10,000 muskets. Up to this point in the history of manufacturing, each product (e.g. each gun) was considered a special order, meaning that parts of a given gun were fitted only for that particular gun and could not be used in other guns. [...] <b>Interchangeability</b> <b>of</b> parts allowed the mass production of parts independent of the final products in which they would be used.|$|R

The <b>interchangeability</b> <b>of</b> the elements of production potential is an economic problem to a greater extent.

Taken in into account, different approaches to managing the effective use and development of productive capacity in an unstable economic environment are proposed...|$|R

The primary objectives of the lecture are to: (i) review interpatient and intrapatient pharmacokinetic variability; (ii) introduce the concepts of therapeutic equiva-lence and bioequivalence; (iii) introduce the current FDA stan-dards on bioequivalence; (iv) introduce the basic approach of bioequivalency testing; (v) provide {{an example of a}} clinical study assessing bioequivalence, showing calculations and con-clusion regarding bioequivalency; and (vi) discuss the current FDA standards of bioequivalence as they relate to the approval of generic formulations of highly variable drugs and to the <b>interchangeability</b> <b>of</b> formulations of drugs with low therapeu-tic indices. The overall goal of the lecture is to introduce phar-macy students to bioequivalence and to bioequivalency testing, such that they may appropriately address the concerns of patients regarding generic substitution and appropriately advise physicians regarding the <b>interchangeability</b> <b>of</b> approved drug formulations...|$|R
