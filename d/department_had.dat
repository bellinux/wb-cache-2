5|$|Critics {{also pointed}} out that the index could allow the city to reach lethally high levels of carbon {{monoxide}} without any alert if the levels of other pollutants remained low. However, the <b>department</b> <b>had</b> to contend with the fact that no universally accepted standards for recording smog existed at that time, and many of the flaws existed {{for lack of a better}} alternative. During the 1966 smog, one of the former commissioners said he would have readily adopted a better system, if one existed.|$|E

Chinese journalists and dissidents said the Central Propaganda <b>Department</b> <b>had</b> instructed media to censor or otherwise under-report on Liu Xiaobo and the peace prize award.|$|E
5|$|Overall, Hurricane Mitch killed about 7,000people in Honduras, with 11,000missing in {{the months}} after the storm. There were 8,000people listed as missing about ten days after Mitch struck, {{although}} problems with record-keeping made it difficult to determine the exact total. Choluteca Department in the southern portion of the country had the most deaths, with 1,200 fatalities. Francisco Morazán Department, which includes Tegucigalpa, had about 1,000deaths, and Yoro <b>Department</b> <b>had</b> 911fatalities. There were deaths in every department, however.

5|$|The {{notion of}} barefoot hordes pushing heavily-loaded bicycles, driving oxcarts, or acting as human pack animals, moving {{hundreds}} {{of tons of}} supplies in this manner was quickly supplanted by trucks (especially Soviet, Chinese, or Eastern Bloc models), which quickly became the main method of supply transportation. As early as December 1961, the 3rd Truck Transportation Group of PAVN's General Rear Services <b>Department</b> <b>had</b> become the first motor transport unit fielded by North Vietnamese to work the trail {{and the use of}} motor transport escalated.|$|E
5|$|The team {{conducted}} intense preparations {{during the}} spring and fall practices before the 1940 season. On one occasion, Stanford athletic director Al Masters angrily complained that the maintenance <b>department</b> <b>had</b> left on the practice field lights, only to be told that the team was still practicing. In one scrimmage, the varsity offense managed only a single touchdown against the freshman team, which prompted Shaughnessy to secretly draft a single-wing playbook in the event that the T formation failed.|$|E
5|$|While other {{companies}} marketed directly to foreign air forces, {{as part of}} the FX program, the F-5G could only be marketed by the State Department. Under this policy umbrella, Northrop had to submit every piece of marketing material to government review, which could take months. The State <b>Department</b> <b>had</b> no interest in selling the FX; from its perspective it was one aircraft among many, leading to a lackadaisical approach, and led to complaints from Northrop that the government was not promoting the F-20 enough.|$|E

5|$|A north–south freeway was {{originally}} planned as an Interstate Highway allowing through traffic {{to bypass the}} city of Detroit. This plan {{was included in the}} 1955 General Location of National System of Interstate Highways (Yellow Book), an early proposal for what would become the Interstate Highway System. The Yellow Book contained an inset of the proposed freeways in and around the Detroit area including a north–south freeway east of the current I-275 corridor. The 1958 numbering plan for Michigan submitted by the State Highway <b>Department</b> <b>had</b> this route initially marked as I-73. William Swanson in the MDOT Highway Planning Unit later stated that the department also planned to reverse the numbering of I-75 and I-275 between Newport and Davisburg; I-75 would have bypassed downtown Detroit just as it bypassed downtown Flint and downtown Saginaw to the north, and the auxiliary number (I-275) would have been used on the freeway through downtown Detroit.|$|E
5|$|For some years, {{the cause}} of the disease was unknown, and {{hypotheses}} included tree ageing, fungi, viruses, and environmental factors such as an increase in ultra-violet light. Another hypothesis was that a genetic problem may have been induced in Northland and Auckland by the thousands of cabbage trees brought into the area from elsewhere and planted in gardens and parks. The Lands and Survey <b>Department</b> <b>had</b> a native plant nursery at Taupo in the central North Island, which was used to grow plants for use in parks, reserves and carparks. In many Northland parks, cabbage trees from the central North Island were growing and flowering within metres of natural forms. Any offspring produced might have been poorly adapted to local conditions. After nearly five years of work, scientists found the cause was a bacterium Phytoplasma australiense, which may be spread from tree to tree by a tiny sap-sucking insect, the introduced passion vine hopper.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Carl Williams, the {{superintendent}} of the New Jersey State Police, {{wrote a letter to}} Pope John Paul II asking him to raise the issue of Shakur's extradition during his talks with President Fidel Castro. During the pope's visit to Cuba in 1998, Shakur agreed to an interview with NBC journalist Ralph Penza. Shakur later published an extensive criticism of the NBC segment, which inter-spliced footage of Trooper Foerster's grieving widow with an FBI photo connected to a bank robbery of which Shakur had been acquitted. On March 10, 1998 New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman asked Attorney General Janet Reno to do whatever it would take to return Shakur from Cuba. Later in 1998, U.S. media widely reported claims that the United States State <b>Department</b> <b>had</b> offered to lift the Cuban embargo in exchange for the return of 90U.S. refugees, including Shakur.|$|E

5|$|In the 1953 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, Route 3 was realigned {{to follow the}} entire length of the Route S3 freeway. In addition, Route 3 in Secaucus was shifted off the Paterson Plank Road to the newly built Secaucus Bypass. The {{original}} alignment of Route 3 became Route 153. Only the section west of Paterson Plank Road was state-maintained after the renumbering, and the entire route was eliminated by the 1990s. In the mid-1950s, Route 3 was planned as one of the original routes of the Interstate Highway System; however, the New Jersey State Highway <b>Department</b> <b>had</b> deemed it too expensive to bring it up to Interstate Highway standards and Interstate 280 was favored instead. In 1959, the Lincoln Tunnel approach was designated as Interstate 495 and Route 3 was truncated back to U.S. Route 1/9 in North Bergen.|$|E
5|$|Jaguar's {{marketing}} <b>department</b> <b>had</b> allocated {{space on}} their {{stand at the}} motor show for the XJ220, but {{had not seen the}} vehicle until its arrival. Jaguar chairman John Egan and Roger Putnam, {{who was in charge of}} Jaguar's racing activities, were shown the vehicle the week before the motor show and signed off on the concept, allowing its unveiling. The car received an overwhelmingly positive reception by public and press, and a number of wealthy Jaguar enthusiasts handed over blank cheques to secure a purchase option should the XJ220 concept go into production. Ferrari's display of their F40 model at the same event was overshadowed; an estimated 90,000 additional visitors came to see the Jaguar XJ220.|$|E
5|$|Legislation for a Pilgrim Tercentenary half dollar was {{introduced}} in the House of Representatives by Massachusetts' Joseph Walsh on March 23, 1920, with the bill designated as H.R. 13227. It was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures, of which Indiana Congressman Albert Vestal was the chairman. That committee held hearings on the bill on March 26, 1920, {{as well as on the}} coinage proposal that would become the Alabama Centennial half dollar, which was the first order of business. Once the committee voted to favorably recommend the Alabama bill, which provided for 100,000 half dollars, it proceeded to consider the Pilgrim proposal. Vestal had two days previously written to Treasury Secretary David F. Houston, and Houston responded that while his <b>department</b> <b>had</b> not opposed the Maine Centennial (previously approved by the committee) or Alabama coinage bills, the Treasury had concerns that issuing large numbers of different designs would aid fraudsters.|$|E

5|$|NuScale {{was founded}} based on {{research}} funded by the US Department of Energy and conducted by Oregon State University, the Idaho National Laboratory, and other colleges beginning in 2000. At the time, Oregon State's nuclear <b>department</b> <b>had</b> been developing passive water-circulation techniques for cooling in nuclear plants. The research grant ended in 2003, but {{a group of scientists}} at Oregon State University continued the work. They built a test lab at one-third the actual scale of the technology and inherited related patents from the university in 2007, in exchange for a small equity in the company. NuScale was founded that same year. Its first funding round was in January 2008 for an undisclosed sum. It began seeking certification with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in February 2008.|$|E
5|$|On 2 October 1997, the {{prosecution}} {{began to call}} more witnesses. Although attendance did not abate, most observers were police officers or paid spectators. One witness, {{who claimed to have}} participated in a sting operation to arrest Sumaji, was arrested for perjury. An officer who investigated Sumaji reported that he had pursued the driver based on instinct, not evidence. Wuryanto, while presenting his account, was contemptuous towards the defence and ordered by the judge several times to answer truthfully. On 3 November, {{the prosecution}} withdrew its case. Under Indonesian law, the judges had the right to find the subject guilty despite the prosecution's withdrawal; after further consideration, on 27 November, the tribunal acquitted Sumaji. Following the acquittal, Bantual police refused to investigate Udin's murder further; several of Yogyakarta's police chiefs stated that the <b>department</b> <b>had</b> fulfilled its duty by arresting a suspect and sending him to trial.|$|E
5|$|Royall and Marbury envisaged {{nuclear energy}} being {{controlled}} by experts, {{with a minimum}} of political interference. The commissioners would be appointed for indefinite terms, and the President's power to remove them would be limited. They would be supported by four advisory boards, for military applications, industrial uses, research and medicine, the membership of which would be restricted to those with technical qualifications. Day-to-day running of the organization would {{be in the hands of}} an administrator and his deputy. The Royall–Marbury Bill was reviewed by the Interim Committee at its July 19 meeting and revised in line with their suggestions. After the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki lifted the veil of secrecy surrounding the Manhattan Project, Royall and Marbury were able to consult with the Attorney General, the Judge Advocate General and the Office of Scientific Research and Development. The draft was sent to the President in August for circulation among, and comment from, affected government agencies. Only the State <b>Department</b> <b>had</b> objections, on the basis that it was still involved in trying to hammer out an international agreement on nuclear energy.|$|E
