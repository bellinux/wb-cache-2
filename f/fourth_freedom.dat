2500|$|Free {{movement}} of capital was traditionally {{seen as the}} <b>fourth</b> <b>freedom,</b> after goods, workers and persons, services and establishment. The original Treaty of Rome required that restrictions on free capital flows only be removed {{to the extent necessary}} for the common market. From the Treaty of Maastricht, now in TFEU article 63, [...] "all restrictions on the {{movement of}} capital between Member States and between Member States and third countries shall be prohibited". This means capital controls of various kinds are prohibited, including limits on buying currency, limits on buying company shares or financial assets, or government approval requirements for foreign investment. By contrast, taxation of capital, including corporate tax, capital gains tax and Financial transaction tax are not affected so long as they do not discriminate by nationality. According to the Capital Movement Directive 1988, Annex I, 13 categories of capital which must move free are covered. In Baars v Inspecteur der Belastingen Particulieren the Court of Justice held that for investments in companies, the capital rules, rather than freedom of establishment rules, were engaged if an investment did not enable a [...] "definite influence" [...] through shareholder voting or other rights by the investor. That case held a Dutch Wealth Tax Act 1964 unjustifiably exempted Dutch investments, but not Mr Baars' investments in an Irish company, from the tax: the wealth tax, or exemptions, had to be applied equally. On the other hand, TFEU article 65(1) does not prevent taxes that distinguish taxpayers based on their residence or the location of an investment (as taxes commonly focus on a person's actual source of profit) or any measures to prevent tax evasion. Apart from tax cases, largely following from the opinions of Advocate General Maduro, a series of cases held that government owned golden shares were unlawful. In Commission v Germany the Commission claimed the German Volkswagen Act 1960 violated article 63, in that §2(1) restricted any party having voting rights exceeding 20% of the company, and §4(3) allowed a minority of 20% of shares held by the Lower Saxony government to block any decisions. Although this was not an impediment to actual purchase of shares, or receipt of dividends by any shareholder, the Court of Justice's Grand Chamber agreed that it was disproportionate for the government's stated aim of protecting workers or minority shareholders. Similarly, in Commission v Portugal the Court of Justice held that Portugal infringed free movement of capital by retaining golden shares in Portugal Telecom that enabled disproportionate voting rights, by creating a [...] "deterrent effect on portfolio investments" [...] and reduing [...] "the attractiveness of an investment". This suggested the Court's preference that a government, if it sought public ownership or control, should nationalise in full the desired proportion of a company in line with TFEU article 345.|$|E

50|$|The Japan-United States {{bilateral}} {{air transport}} agreement of 1952 {{has been viewed}} as being particularly contentious, because unlimited fifth freedom traffic rights have been granted to designated US air carriers serving destinations in the Asia Pacific region west of Japan. For example, in the early 1990s, the Japanese government's refusal to permit flights on the New York City—Osaka—Sydney route led to protests by the US government and the airlines that applied to serve that route. The Japanese government countered that about 10% of the traffic on the Japan - Australia sector was third and <b>fourth</b> <b>freedom</b> traffic {{to and from the}} US, while the bilateral agreement specified that primary justification for unlimited fifth freedom traffic was to fill up aircraft carrying a majority of US-originated or US-destined traffic under third and <b>fourth</b> <b>freedom</b> rights. Japan had held many unused fifth freedom traffic rights beyond the USA. However, these were seen as being less valuable than the fifth freedom traffic rights enjoyed by US air carriers via Japan, because of the higher operating costs of Japanese airlines and geographical circumstances. Japan serves as a useful gateway to Asia for North American travelers. The US contended that Japan's favourable geographical location and its flag airlines' carriage of a sizeable volume of sixth freedom traffic via gateway cities in Japan helped to level the playing field. In 1995, the air transport agreement was updated by way of liberalizing Japanese carriers' access to US destinations, while placing selected restrictions on US air carriers.|$|E

The ASEAN-SAM is expected to liberalise air travel between member-states in the ASEAN region, allowing ASEAN airlines to benefit directly from the growth in air travel, and also free up tourism, trade, investment, and service flows between member states.

50|$|The {{unofficial}} {{sixth freedom}} combines {{the third and}} fourth freedoms and is the right to carry passengers or cargo from a second country to a third country by stopping in one's own country. It can also be characterized as a form of the fifth freedom with an intermediate stop in the operating airline's home market. This characterization is often invoked as protectionist policy as the traffic, like fifth freedom traffic, is secondary in nature to third and <b>fourth</b> <b>freedom</b> traffic. Consequently, some nations seek to regulate sixth freedom traffic as though it were fifth freedom traffic. China {{is an example of a}} country that restricts sixth freedom traffic from third party countries. Specifically, it is difficult for airlines to obtain permission from China to serve the country via codeshare flights from intermediate countries.|$|E

40|$|The air {{transport}} regime, {{which was established}} under Bermuda I-type agreements, has been altered {{during the last two}} decades through the liberalization of international {{air transport}}. International air transport liberalization was initiated by the domestic deregulation of the US. After that, the US began exporting its liberalization policy to the international air transport market through liberal bilateral agreements. Since the early- 1990 's, the US has concluded numerous open skies agreements. Corresponding with the US liberalization policy, the EC initiated its regional liberalization and the EU achieved a fully open aviation market within the EU region through three liberalization packages. While liberalization of air transport has been proceeding in the international market, Japan was seeking to amend the Japan-US Civil Air Transport Agreement of 1952, which was modeled on Bermuda I. The development of Japanese and US carriers made the agreement unsuitable for the reality of the Japan-US market. At the same time, the ambiguous capacity clauses of the agreement caused serious interpretive disputes. Japan was seeking a restrictive agreement while the US desired an open skies agreement. It became evident during air transport negotiations. Japan and the US concluded an interim agreement in January 1998. The agreement of 1998 grants six carriers (three carriers for each country) unlimited third and <b>fourth</b> <b>freedom</b> rights and greatly liberalizes fifth freedom rights. The agreement also guarantees other Japan and US carriers very liberal third and <b>fourth</b> <b>freedom</b> rights and some limited fifth freedom rights. Furthermore, the agreement permits code-sharing in the Japan-US market for the first time. Although the two countries managed to reach on agreement, Japan must amend the Japanese Aviation Act for more efficient code-sharing between Japan and US carriers and solve its serious airport congestion problem in order to expand services under the new agreement...|$|E
