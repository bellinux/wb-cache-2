5000|$|The cut {{should be}} made to retain 1 meter or more of the fiber, in order to {{establish}} <b>equilibrium</b> <b>mode</b> <b>distribution</b> conditions for the second measurement. In a multimode fiber, the lack of an <b>equilibrium</b> <b>mode</b> <b>distribution</b> could introduce errors in the measurement due to output coupling effects. In a single-mode fiber, measuring a shorter cutback fiber could result in significant transmission of cladding modes (light carried in the cladding rather than the core of the optical fiber), distorting the measurement. The errors introduced will result in conservative results (i.e., higher transmission losses and lower bandwidths) than would be realized under equilibrium conditions.|$|E
50|$|In {{multimode}} fibers, {{the term}} equilibrium numerical aperture is sometimes used. This {{refers to the}} numerical aperture {{with respect to the}} extreme exit angle of a ray emerging from a fiber in which <b>equilibrium</b> <b>mode</b> <b>distribution</b> has been established.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Equilibrium</b> <b>mode</b> power <b>distributions</b> were {{reported}} in early multimode transmission systems at propagation distances as short as a few hundred metres. However, as fibre manufacturing improved, the minute waveguide dimensional and structural changes that produce mode-mixing have been greatly reduced. The length of fibre required to attain true equilibrium is now {{much greater than the}} length of practical multimode transmission systems, which makes the term effectively obsolete.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>equilibrium</b> <b>mode</b> power <b>distribution</b> {{of light}} {{travelling}} in an optical waveguide or fiber, is {{the distribution of}} light {{that is no longer}} changing with fibre length or with input modal excitation. This phenomenon requires both mode filtering and mode mixing to occur in the fibre to produce a state that is independent of the <b>mode</b> power <b>distribution</b> launched by the light source. At propagation distances exceeding the equilibrium length, intramodal pulse distortion increases (bandwidth decreases) as the square root of length.|$|R

50|$|The term {{equilibrium}} length is sometimes {{used to describe}} a stationary mode distribution, which is the length of multi-mode optical fiber necessary to attain a static mode distribution from a specific excitation condition. Equilibrium length is, strictly, the longest such length, as would result from a widely variable range of input excitation. Other terms for {{equilibrium length}} are equilibrium coupling length and <b>equilibrium</b> <b>mode</b> <b>distribution</b> length.|$|E

The Fe-sensor cannot be operated in <b>equilibrium</b> <b>mode</b> because of the very long time necessary to reach the hydrogen pressure equilibrium.

40|$|Self-starting {{performance}} {{is a key}} factor in the evaluation of a Darrieus straight-bladed vertical axis turbine. Most traditional studies have analyzed the turbine’s self-starting capability using the experimental and numerical data of the forced rotation. A 2 D numerical model based on the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software ANSYS-Fluent was developed to simulate the self-starting process of the rotor at constant incident water-flow velocities. The vertical-axis turbine (VAT) rotor is driven directly by the resultant torque generated by the water flow and system loads, including the friction and reverse loads of the generator. It is found that the incident flow velocity and the moment of inertia of the rotor have little effect on the averaged values of tip-speed ratios in the equilibrium stage under no-load conditions. In the system load calculations, four modes of the self-starting were found: stable <b>equilibrium</b> <b>mode,</b> unstable <b>equilibrium</b> <b>mode,</b> switch mode and halt mode. The dimensionless power coefficient in the simulations of passive rotation conditions is found to be, on average, 38 % higher than those achieved in the simulations of forced rotation conditions...|$|R

50|$|In {{the absence}} of strong mode-mixing, high order mode {{filtering}} is the primary remaining mechanism for potential change of an input <b>mode</b> power <b>distribution.</b> If a well-aligned laser is the optical source, the <b>mode</b> power <b>distribution</b> is highly concentrated in the lowest order modes, and remains essentially unchanged with distance {{due to the lack}} of mode-mixing. If an optical source that overfills the fibre is used, only the highest order guided mode group experiences excess attenuation, and the <b>mode</b> power <b>distribution</b> becomes slightly filtered as a result.

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} a novel scene change detection method using complexity and edge direction based on intra prediction mode in H. 264 /AVC compressed video. When scene change occurs, {{there is less}} temporal correlation between consecutive frames. Therefore, most of macro-blocks are encoded in intra mode. Using this property, the proposed method calculates the percentage of intra mode blocks in each predictive frame {{in order to get}} candidates of scene change frames. To detect accurate scene change frames, we generate the Intra <b>Mode</b> <b>Distribution</b> Histogram (IMDH) representing edge directionality and image roughness. By similarity matching of consecutive two IMDHs, we decide scene change frames. The distance between two IMDHs is measured using χ 2 -statistic. The experimental results show that our method is efficient and robust. Key-Words: Scene Change Detection, H. 264 /AVC, Intra <b>Mode</b> <b>Distribution</b> Histogram. ...|$|R

In Fullerton, Karney, and Baylis (2012), we show that it may actu-ally reduce emissions in other sectors (“negative leakage”). But reducing emissions in both sec-tors may merely reflect welfare costs of carbon policy that reduce real income and, thus, reduce consumption of both outputs. These possibilities capture the concern that unilateral carbon policy might have a high cost per global unit of carbon abated (that is, low “cost effectiveness”).

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{an investigation into}} methods for controlling the <b>mode</b> <b>distribution</b> in multimode optical fibres. The major contributions presented in this thesis are summarised below. Emerging standards for Gigabit Ethernet transmission over multimode optical fibre {{have led to a}} resurgence of interest in the precise control, and specification, of modal launch conditions. In particular, commercial LED and OTDR test equipment does not, in general, comply with these standards. There is therefore a need for mode control devices, which can ensure compliance with the standards. A novel device consisting of a point-load mode-scrambler in tandem with a mode-filter is described in this thesis. The device, which has been patented, may be tuned to achieve a wide range of <b>mode</b> <b>distributions</b> and has been implemented in a ruggedised package for field use. Various other techniques for mode control have been described in this work, including the use of Long Period Gratings and air-gap mode-filters. Some of the methods have been applied to other applications, such as speckle suppression and in sensor technology. A novel, self-referencing, sensor comprising two modal groups in the <b>Mode</b> Power <b>Distribution</b> has been designed and tested. The feasibility of a two-channel Mode Group Diversity Multiplexed system has been demonstrated over 985 m. A test apparatus for measuring <b>mode</b> <b>distribution</b> has been designed and constructed. The apparatus consists of a purpose-built video microscope, and comprehensive control and analysis software written in Visual Basic. The system may be fitted with a Silicon camera or an InGaAs camera, for measurement in the 850 nm and 130 nm transmission windows respectively. A limitation of the measurement method, when applied to well-filled fibres, has been identified and an improvement to the method has been proposed, based on modelled Laguerre Gauss field solutions.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{proposes a}} two-step {{evaluation}} process {{to assess the}} developed driving cycles for carbon dioxide emissions. The {{first step is to}} compare the driving operating <b>mode</b> <b>distributions</b> from developed driving cycles with real world ones. The second step is to predict the carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions by using the developed driving cycles under the latest version of MOVES, MOVES 2010 framework, which are then compared with and evaluated by the real-world CO 2 emissions. Evaluation results show that the driving cycles developed by the driving operating <b>mode</b> <b>distribution</b> measure result in more accurate CO 2 emission estimations. Introduction and Background The greenhouse gases (GHG) contribute a substantial share of responsibilities to the globate climate change or global warming, which is also called greenhouse effect.

Two diode laser stacks with six bars each, delivering 370 watts of initial laser power are polarization-multiplexed to achieve higher brightness. Each stack incorporates a beam transformation optic that transforms the oblong <b>mode</b> <b>distribution</b> of the diode laser stacks into symmetric beams.

Our findings suggest that monopoly unions with risk-averse/neutral members may effectively act as commitment devices driving firms to the symmetric Cournot mode of competition.
