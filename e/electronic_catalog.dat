25|$|The {{introduction}} of electronic {{information in the}} last quarter of the twentieth century brought a new era of library operations and services, with the ability to access information resources beyond those available in the physical facility. As early as 1973, the Library began to take advantage of electronic information services by acquiring the New York Times Information Bank, the first computerized online information retrieval service. By the 1990s, the library was able to access thousands of U.S. and foreign newspapers and magazines, highly specialized biographic and subject information, and U.S. government and think tank documents through commercial and government databases. The development of the Department's Intranet on the Open Net system has made the resources of the library accessible to Department employees worldwide. The library's <b>electronic</b> <b>catalog,</b> new acquisitions lists, and connection to reference services are available on the Department's I-Net.|$|E

40|$|The {{number of}} <b>electronic</b> <b>catalogs</b> has grown rapidly {{during the past}} few years. Most of these catalogs use {{standard}} databases for storing and retrieving product information. Using ordinary databases for product catalogs, however, has the major drawback that it is often very difficult to find the products desired: very often, the database does not return a matching product at all or it returns many products that have to be examined manually. To overcome this problem, we propose the use of Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) techniques as an approach to requirement-oriented retrieval of products. CBR incorporates product knowledge into the database by means of a similarity measure. Recently, a number of commercial <b>electronic</b> <b>catalogs</b> based on CBR have been realized.

40|$|The {{world today}} {{is full of}} {{information}} systems which make huge quantities of information available. This incredible amount of information is clearly overwhelming Internet endusers. As a consequence, intelligent tools to identify worthwhile information are needed, in order to fully assist people in finding the right information. Moreover, most systems are ultimately used, not just to provide information, but also to solve problems. Encouraged by the growing popular success of Internet and the enormous business potential of electronic commerce, e-catalogs have been consolidated {{as one of the}} most relevant types of information systems. Nearly all currently available <b>electronic</b> <b>catalogs</b> are offering tools for extracting product information based on key-attribute filtering methods. The most advanced <b>electronic</b> <b>catalogs</b> are implemented as recommender systems using collaborative filtering techniques. This dissertation focuses on strategies for coping with the difficulty of building intelligent catalogs which fully support the user in his purchase decision-making process, while maintaining the scalability of the whole system. The contributions of this thesis lie on a mixed-initiative system which is inspired by observations on traditional commerce activities. Such a conversational model consists basically of a dialog between the customer and the system, where the user criticizes proposed products and the catalog suggests new products accordingly. Constraint satisfaction techniques are analyzed in order to provide a uniform framework for modeling <b>electronic</b> <b>catalogs</b> for configurable products. Within the same framework, user preferences and optimization constraints are also easily modeled. Searching strategies for proposing the adequate products according to criteria are described in detail. Another dimension of this dissertation faces the problem of scalability, i. e., the problem of supporting hundreds, or thousands of users simultaneously using intelligent <b>electronic</b> <b>catalogs.</b> Traditional wisdom would presume that in order to provide full assistance to users in complex tasks, the business logic of the system must be complex, thus preventing scalability. SmartClient is a software architectural model that uses constraint satisfaction problems for representing solution spaces, instead of traditional models which represent solution spaces by collections of single solutions. This main idea is supported by the fact that constraint solvers are extreme in their compactness and simplicity, while providing sophisticated business logic. Different SmartClient architecture configurations are provided for different uses and architectural requirements. In order to illustrate the use of constraint satisfaction techniques for complex <b>electronic</b> <b>catalogs</b> with the SmartClient architecture, a commercial Internet-based application for travel planning, called reality, has been successfully developed. Travel planning is a particularly appropriate domain for validating the results of this research, since travel information is dynamic, travel planning problems are combinatorial, and moreover, complex user preferences and optimization constraints must be taken into consideration...|$|R

40|$|To {{attract and}} keep {{people at a}} web site {{is one of the}} major {{challenges}} in electronic commerce. More advertising, providing more useful information, or designing more flashy pages cannot prevent the Internet surfers from getting lost in the huge amount of information, especially the electronic catalogues. One solution is to customize the website for each for individual user through the analysis of preferences and interests in the user profile. The site should be able to customize itself on information content, information organization and information display. Information collection, analysis, and customization form a process to improve and customize the web site for each user, without Webmaster interference in normal operation.

However, apart from design frameworks and guidelines for Web-based EC, not much has been done by researchers or practitioners on how <b>electronic</b> <b>catalogs</b> (e-catalogs) influence the users' desirability and satisfaction as purchasers. In this correspondence, we investigate the form of media that represented the most efficient mode to present products to Web users by summarizing and evaluating various existing forms of e-catalogs and their respective responses from Web users. We conclude that a 3 -D virtual object (VO) is the most efficient mode of <b>electronic</b> <b>cataloging</b> for Web interface due to a better sense of presence of users, a more attractive and enjoyable media of delivery of useful information to users, and a higher level of engagement of user's memory. A 3 -D VO, as a result, generates the highest users' satisfaction, which leads to increased propensity to purchase. Further, we discuss the practical and theoretical research implications of these findings to e-catalogs. © 2007 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT * <b>Electronic</b> <b>catalogs</b> are {{information}} about {{products and services}} in the electronic commerce environment, and require diverse and flexible schemas. A catalog management system supports the definition, storage, retrieval, and management of product information throughout the e-commerce process, and thus, is an essential component in almost all e-business applications. However, the diversity in product types, applications, and vocabulary (language) makes it a difficult system to design and implement. We present in this paper the modeling and design issues in an e-catalog management system and introduce a system that implements our approaches to these issues.
