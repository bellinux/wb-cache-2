5|$|Chatwin {{had hoped}} to read Classics at Merton College, Oxford, but the end of National Service in the United Kingdom meant there was more {{competition}} for university places. He was forced to consider other options. His parents discouraged the ideas he offered—an acting career or work in the Colonial Service in Kenya. Instead, Chatwin's <b>father</b> <b>asked</b> one of his clients for a letter of introduction to the auction house Sotheby's. An interview was arranged, and Chatwin secured a job there.|$|E
5|$|Tom Pryce's helmet design was, in {{comparison}} to later drivers', simple and restrained. His helmet was plain white all over until 1970. At that year's race at Castle Combe, his <b>father</b> <b>asked</b> Pryce to make his helmet stand out more {{so that he could}} easily identify him in a pack of cars. Pryce added five black vertical lines to his helmet, placed just above his visor. From that time the only change to this design was the addition of a Welsh flag to the side of his helmet in 1974.|$|E
5|$|González-Gordon was {{involved}} with conservationism from an early age; {{he was also an}} avid bird watcher and would become an ornithologist. His family estate was located in the Coto Doñana, a wetland {{at the mouth of the}} river Guadalquivir, near Jerez de la Frontera, in southern Spain. Here González-Gordon became interested in the local ecosystem and invited European ornithologists to visit the area. When two Spanish ornithologists, Professor Francisco Bernis and José Antonio Valverde visited, González-Gordon served as their guide. The González-Gordon family saw that the wetlands were threatened by the planting of eucalyptus trees and large-scale drainage plans proposed by the government. Mauricio, together with his <b>father,</b> <b>asked</b> Bernis to try and influence Spanish dictator Francisco Franco into abandoning these proposals. The trio wrote a memorandum which was presented to Franco himself by Mauricio's father Manuel. By November 1953, Bernis had finished a report on the value of the Doñana, which showed that the area had exceptional ecological value. The group sought international support for their goals and found it. The efforts of González-Gordon to dissuade Franco exposed him to some danger, but the Franco government conceded and the drainage plans were aborted.|$|E

500|$|Troy Middleton was {{the fifth}} of nine {{children}} and grew {{up at the end}} of the 19th century on a 400-acre plantation in southeastern Copiah County. [...] The plantation was virtually a self-contained community, and he had a variety of chores to do depending on the season, with sausage-stuffing being one of his favorites. The local Lick Creek and Strong River had plentiful fish that he would catch, and he loved to hunt, particularly with his 12-gauge shotgun. [...] While his family was Episcopal by heritage, they worshiped at the Bethel Baptist Church, a few miles west of Georgetown, the only church reachable on a Sunday morning. [...] His education was conducted at the small Bethel schoolhouse, near the Bethel Church, but in the summertime he was tutored by his oldest sister Emily, who came home from Blue Mountain College to share her knowledge of different subjects with her family.
