5000|$|The <b>delayed</b> <b>neutrons</b> allow {{a nuclear}} reactor to respond several orders of {{magnitude}} more slowly than just prompt neutrons would alone.

25|$|Loss of <b>delayed</b> <b>neutrons</b> - In {{order to}} be predictably controlled, nuclear {{reactors}} rely on <b>delayed</b> <b>neutrons.</b> They require additional slowly-evolving neutrons from fission product decay to continue the chain reaction. Because the <b>delayed</b> <b>neutrons</b> evolve slowly, this makes the reactor very controllable. In an LFTR, the presence of fission products in the heat exchanger and piping means a portion of these <b>delayed</b> <b>neutrons</b> are also lost. They {{do not participate in}} the core's critical chain reaction, which in turn means the reactor behaves less gently during changes of flow, power, etc. Approximately up to half of the <b>delayed</b> <b>neutrons</b> can be lost. In practice, it means that the heat exchanger must be compact so that the volume outside the core is as small as possible. The more compact (higher power density) the core is, the more important this issue becomes. Having more fuel outside the core in the heat exchangers also means more of the expensive fissile fuel is needed to start the reactor. This makes a fairly compact heat exchanger an important design requirement for an LFTR.|$|R

2500|$|The {{physics of}} {{radioactive}} decay also affects neutron populations in a reactor. One such process is <b>delayed</b> <b>neutron</b> emission {{by a number}} of neutron-rich fission isotopes. These delayed neutrons account for about 0.65% of the total neutrons produced in fission, with the remainder (termed [...] "prompt neutrons") released immediately upon fission. The fission products which produce delayed neutrons have half lives for their decay by neutron emission that range from milliseconds to as long as several minutes, and so considerable time is required to determine exactly when a reactor reaches the critical point. Keeping the reactor in the zone of chain-reactivity where delayed neutrons are necessary to achieve a critical mass state allows mechanical devices or human operators to control a chain reaction in [...] "real time"; otherwise the time between achievement of criticality and nuclear meltdown {{as a result of an}} exponential power surge from the normal nuclear chain reaction, would be too short to allow for intervention. This last stage, where delayed neutrons are no longer required to maintain criticality, is known as the prompt critical point. There is a scale for describing criticality in numerical form, in which bare criticality is known as zero dollars and the prompt critical point is one dollar, and other points in the process interpolated in cents.|$|E
50|$|<b>Delayed</b> <b>neutron</b> {{analysis}} {{can be used}} for accurate screening of various materials for fissile content. The determination requires only six minutes and features a 15-picogram detection limit. Samples of smears, vegetation, soil, rock, plastics, wood, metal, and sand are equally amenable to <b>delayed</b> <b>neutron</b> analysis. This tool facilitates International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA efforts to establish wide area monitoring and enables individual inspectors to obtain large numbers of samples in the hopes of finding required evidence. By screening those samples, the very high costs of destructive analysis are required only for those samples deemed interesting. <b>Delayed</b> <b>neutron</b> analysis is becoming increasingly useful for these studies.|$|E

50|$|For every 1000 {{neutrons}} {{released by}} fission, a small number, typically {{no more than}} about 7, are delayed neutrons which are emitted from the fission product precursors, called <b>delayed</b> <b>neutron</b> emitters. This <b>delayed</b> <b>neutron</b> fraction, {{on the order of}} 0.007 for uranium, is crucial for the control of the neutron chain reaction in reactors. It is called one dollar of reactivity. The lifetime of delayed neutrons ranges from fractions of seconds to almost 100 seconds after fission. The neutrons are usually classified in 6 <b>delayed</b> <b>neutron</b> groups. The average neutron lifetime considering delayed neutrons is approximately 0.1 sec, which makes the chain reaction relatively easy to control over time. The remaining 993 prompt neutrons are released very quickly, approximately 1 μs after the fission event.|$|E
50|$|Using U-235 as an example, this nucleus absorbs thermal neutrons, and the {{immediate}} mass products of a fission event are two large fission fragments, which are {{remnants of the}} formed U-236 nucleus. These fragments emit two or three free neutrons (2.5 on average), called prompt neutrons. A subsequent fission fragment occasionally undergoes a stage of radioactive decay that yields an additional neutron, called a <b>delayed</b> <b>neutron.</b> These neutron-emitting fission fragments are called <b>delayed</b> <b>neutron</b> precursor atoms.|$|E
5000|$|In nuclear engineering, {{a prompt}} neutron is a neutron {{immediately}} emitted by a nuclear fission event. Prompt neutrons {{emerge from the}} fission of an unstable fissionable or fissile heavy nucleus almost instantaneously. <b>Delayed</b> <b>neutron</b> decay can occur within the same context, emitted after beta decay {{of one of the}} fission products. <b>Delayed</b> <b>neutron</b> decay can occur at times from a few milliseconds to a few minutes. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission defines a prompt neutron as a neutron emerging from fission within 10−14 seconds.|$|E
40|$|We {{performed}} measurements with a small, light-weight neutron generator, {{which can}} be carried by one person. The time structure of <b>delayed</b> <b>neutrons</b> was measured in order to detect and identify hidden or shielded nuclear material in geometrical configurations whereof only the outer shape is known but little or no information {{is available on the}} inner structure. A small block of depleted uranium was irradiated repeatedly by a sealed neutron tube of a 14 MeV neutron generator for different time intervals. The <b>delayed</b> <b>neutrons</b> were measured by a neutron "slab" counter consisting of 6 He- 3 tubes moderated by high density polyethylene. After the end of each interrogating neutron pulse we analyzed the <b>delayed</b> <b>neutrons</b> in different time intervals, ranging from 3 s to 300 s and thus recorded the "decay curves" of the <b>delayed</b> <b>neutrons.</b> We optimized neutron irradiation and measuring time to gain information on the existence of fissionable material in a short time.

40|$|The {{physical}} and technical means are discussed {{for the detection}} and identification of nuclear weapons. Especially active detection methods (neutron irradiation) give clear results. It {{is nearly impossible to}} obstruct these methods by counter measures. A small volume of depleted uranium was irradiated with neutrons from radioactive sources as well as from a transportable neutron generator. The direct and <b>delayed</b> <b>neutrons</b> from induced fission were detected. The time dependent intensity of the <b>delayed</b> <b>neutrons</b> gives within a short time a clear indication of the fissionable material...|$|R
40|$|Nondestructive {{measuring}} capabilities for the in situ {{detection and}} analysis of nuclear material are considered as possible measures to discover illicit trafficking of nuclear material and to prohibit nuclear proliferation. Therefore, we performed measurements on the time structure of <b>delayed</b> <b>neutrons</b> after the induced fission of nuclear material by a pulsed 14 MeV neutron tube. The measured decay curves were fitted to the well known six groups of <b>delayed</b> <b>neutrons.</b> The relative strengths of the different groups were reproduced well for the measurements with the long irradiation time (60 s) and the long counting time (approx. 200 s) for the <b>delayed</b> <b>neutrons.</b> For shorter irradiation or measuring times {{only some of the}} relations could be reproduced. Our measurements show that a clear detection of the <b>delayed</b> <b>neutrons</b> is possible, even in presence of a high neutron background. So the measurements are not disturbed by neutrons from (alpha, neutron) reaction inside uranium oxide or from spontaneous fission of plutonium isotopes. Thinking of verification of weapons materials this measurement method allows confirmation of fissile materials content without disclosing sensitive information (like geometry). These experiments show that fissionable material can be detected clearly and easily in a suspicious box with a pulsed neutron generator within a very short time (several minutes) ...|$|R

50|$|In nuclear engineering, {{a prompt}} neutron is a neutron {{immediately}} emitted by a nuclear fission event, {{as opposed to}} a <b>delayed</b> <b>neutron</b> decay which can occur within the same context, emitted after beta decay of one of the fission products anytime from a few milliseconds to a few minutes later.|$|E
50|$|By definition, a {{reactivity}} of zero dollars is just barely {{on the edge}} of criticality using both prompt and <b>delayed</b> <b>neutrons.</b> A reactivity less than zero dollars is subcritical; if not already zero, the power level will decrease exponentially and a sustained chain reaction will not occur. One dollar is defined as the threshold between delayed and prompt criticality; on average each prompt neutron will cause exactly one additional fission, and the <b>delayed</b> <b>neutrons</b> will then increase power. A reactivity between $0 and $1 is still supercritical and power will still increase exponentially, but because the chain reaction partly depends on the <b>delayed</b> <b>neutrons</b> the power rise will be slow enough to be easily and safely controlled with mechanical control rods. A power reactor operating at steady state (constant power) will therefore have an average {{reactivity of}} $0, with small fluctuations above and below this value.|$|R
40|$|The {{calculation}} of the time-dependent extinction probability (EP) in an infinite medium of fissile material is calculated including <b>delayed</b> <b>neutrons.</b> This extension of the model reveals some interesting consequences, {{one of which is}} the appearance of an initial plateau in the EP in the range 10 (- 6) to 10 (- 4) s which is significantly less than the final asymptotic plateau value reached as time tends to infinity; i. e. the steady state EP. This steady state is delayed by the presence of the <b>delayed</b> <b>neutrons</b> by a time of the order of 3 /lambda (similar to 36 s) where lambda is the mean decay constant of the precursors. The presence of the initial plateau is due specifically to <b>delayed</b> <b>neutrons</b> and has not been commented on before. Several other situations are considered, with differing initial conditions, and are illustrated by numerical results...|$|R
50|$|Like thermal {{reactors}}, {{fast neutron}} reactors {{are controlled by}} keeping the criticality of the reactor reliant on <b>delayed</b> <b>neutrons,</b> with gross control from neutron-absorbing control rods or blades.|$|R
5000|$|In nuclear engineering, a <b>delayed</b> <b>neutron</b> is {{a neutron}} emitted after a nuclear fission event, {{by one of}} the fission {{products}} (or actually, a fission product daughter after beta decay), any time from a few milliseconds to a few minutes after the fission event.

5000|$|The <b>delayed</b> <b>neutron</b> {{fraction}} of the SL-1 is 0.70%... Conclusive evidence revealed that the SL-1 excursion {{was caused by the}} partial withdrawal of the central control rod. The reactivity associated with the 20 inch withdrawal of this one rod has been estimated to be 2.4% δk/k which was sufficient to induce prompt criticality and place the reactor on a 4 millisecond period.|$|E
50|$|Another concept, is the {{effective}} fraction of delayed neutrons, {{which is the}} fraction of delayed neutrons weighted (over space, energy, and angle) on the adjoint neutron flux. This concept arises because delayed neutrons are emitted with an energy spectrum more thermalized relative to prompt neutrons. For low enriched uranium fuel working on a thermal neutron spectrum, {{the difference between the}} average and effective <b>delayed</b> <b>neutron</b> fractions can reach 50 pcm.|$|E
50|$|In a delayed-critical assembly, the <b>delayed</b> <b>neutrons</b> {{are needed}} to make k-effective greater than one. Thus the time between {{successive}} generations of the reaction, T, {{is dominated by the}} time it takes for the <b>delayed</b> <b>neutrons</b> to be released, on the order of seconds or minutes. Therefore, the reaction will increase slowly, with a long time constant. This is slow enough to allow the reaction to be controlled with electromechanical control systems such as control rods, and as such all nuclear reactors are designed to operate in the delayed-criticality regime.|$|R
5000|$|The CAESAR reactor design {{exploits}} {{the fact}} that the fission products and daughter isotopes produced via nuclear reactions also decay to produce additional <b>delayed</b> <b>neutrons.</b> Filippone claims that unlike conventional water-cooled fission reactors, where fission occurring in enriched [...] fuel rods moderated by liquid-water coolant ultimately creates a Maxwellian thermal neutron flux profile, the neutron energy profile from <b>delayed</b> <b>neutrons</b> varies widely.

40|$|In {{previous}} works, {{the authors}} have developed an effective solution technique for calculating the pulsed Feynman- and Rossi-alpha formulae.

Furthermore, it was also shown that both the deterministic (i. e. {} synchronizing with the pulsing of neutron source) and stochastic (non-synchronizing) Feynman-alpha formulae can be obtained with this solution technique. However, for mathematical simplicity and the sake of insight, the formal derivation was performed in a model without <b>delayed</b> <b>neutrons.</b> In this paper, to demonstrate the robustness of the technique, the pulsed Feynman- and Rossi-alpha formulae were re-derived by taking one group of <b>delayed</b> <b>neutrons</b> into account.

5000|$|The chain {{reaction}} in the first critical reactor, CP-1, was initiated by neutron sources generated during its prior subcritical test runs.

50|$|In contrast, a {{critical}} assembly {{is said to}} be prompt-critical if it is critical (k=1) without any contribution from <b>delayed</b> <b>neutrons</b> and prompt-supercritical if it is supercritical (the fission rate growing exponentially, k>1) without any contribution from <b>delayed</b> <b>neutrons.</b> In this case the time between successive generations of the reaction, T, is only limited by the fission rate from the prompt neutrons, and the increase in the reaction will be extremely rapid, causing a rapid release of energy within a few milliseconds.
