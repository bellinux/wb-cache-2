500|$|Although Crawley {{itself is}} not {{mentioned}} in the Domesday Book of 1086, the nearby settlements of Ifield and Worth are recorded. The first written record of Crawley dates from 1202, when a licence was issued by King John for a weekly market on Wednesdays. Crawley grew slowly in importance over the next few centuries, but was boosted in the 18th century by the construction of the turnpike road between London and Brighton. When this was completed in 1770, travel between the newly fashionable seaside resort and London became safer and quicker, and Crawley (located approximately halfway between the two) prospered as a coaching halt. [...] By 1839 it offered almost an hourly service to both destinations. The George, a timber-framed house dating from the 15thcentury, expanded to become a large coaching inn, taking over adjacent buildings. Eventually an annexe had to be built {{in the middle of the}} wide High Street; this survived until the 1930s. The original building has become the George Hotel, with conference facilities and 84bedrooms; it retains many period features including an iron <b>fireback.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{fireplace}} is red Rouge de Rance marble {{with cream}} and black marble, patterned with inlaid semi-precious stone including green malachite: all imported materials. The intertwined initials of Edward and Elizabeth {{his wife are}} central on the fire surround and <b>fireback,</b> which is prominently dated 1867. The inlay features the White Rose of Yorkshire, possibly in Parian marble, which is repeated on the carved corinthian columns on the fire surround. The mantelshelf is massive enough to support three lifesized marble busts: Edward Akroyd on the left, his father Jonathan in the centre, and his wife Elizabeth on the right (by Nicolo Bazzanti). [...] The bust of Elizabeth is remarkable in that it has the trompe-l'Å“il effect of a veil over the face. The glazed hearth tiles are similar to Mintons tiles but are probably locally made.|$|E
50|$|The crested <b>fireback</b> {{is found}} in lowland forests of the Thai-Malay Peninsula, Borneo and Sumatra. There are four {{subspecies}} of the crested <b>fireback,</b> but in 2014 the subspecies rufa was split as a distinct species from the others. Males of the subspecies from Borneo and Bangka Island, L. i. ignita (lesser Bornean crested <b>fireback)</b> and L. i. nobilis (greater Bornean crested <b>fireback),</b> have brown central tail feathers, whitish legs and are rufous below. The male Vieillot's crested <b>fireback,</b> L. rufa, of the Thai-Malay Peninsula and most of Sumatra has white central tail feathers, red legs and bluish black streaked white below. The final subspecies, Delacour's crested <b>fireback,</b> L. i. macartneyi, {{is found in}} south-eastern Sumatra and the male has white to the tail, whitish legs and a variable amount of rufous below. As macartneyi specimens are variable, the Handbook of Birds of the World regards it as a hybrid between rufa and a possible relictual or introduced population of ignita. The female of L. i ignita and L. i. nobilis have a dark, blackish tail and whitish legs, while female of L. i.a rufa has a chestnut brown tail and red legs.|$|E

50|$|The Siamese <b>fireback</b> (Lophura diardi) {{also known}} as Diard's <b>fireback</b> is a fairly large, {{approximately}} 80 cm long, pheasant. The male has a grey plumage with an extensive red facial skin, crimson legs and feet, ornamental black crest feathers, reddish brown iris and long curved blackish tail. The female is a brown bird with blackish wing and tail feathers.The Siamese <b>fireback</b> is distributed to the lowland and evergreen forests of Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam in Southeast Asia. This species is also designated as the national bird of Thailand. The female usually lays between four and eight rosy eggs.|$|E

50|$|It was {{introduced}} into Europe by the 14th century with its main decorative uses being as <b>firebacks</b> and plates for woodburning stoves in Germany, the Netherlands and Scandinavia.

5000|$|The primary {{function}} of a <b>fireback</b> {{is to protect the}} wall {{at the back of the}} fireplace. This was especially important where the wall was constructed of insubstantial material such as daub (a mud and straw mixture coating interwoven wooden wattles), brick or soft stone. Protective metal plates that became available when cast iron was developed enabled fires to be placed against walls without danger to the fabric of the building. A secondary function is as a radiator of stored heat. The metal is heated by the fire, and then that heat is radiated into the room. The thick iron keeps the heat which would otherwise be lost and gives back this heat to the room. A <b>fireback</b> thus may increase the efficiency of the fire. Wood fires have low efficiency, and for those that prefer the atmosphere of an open wood fire the <b>fireback</b> helps to minimise this problem. The thicker the <b>fireback,</b> the longer (and softer) this radiative effect.|$|E

50|$|Grounds: There are {{numerous}} <b>firebacks,</b> {{which are the}} remains of the enlisted soldiers' chimneys, as well as reconstructed replicas of the guard house and an officers' quarters. A 40 ft monument commemorates the commanding officers and men who were stationed here. Natural features found in the park include a rock-shelter cave and large glacial erratics.|$|R
50|$|Herringbone work, {{particularly}} in stone, {{is also used}} to make <b>firebacks</b> in stone hearths. Acidic flue gases tend to corrode lime mortar, so a finely-set herringbone could remain intact with a minimum of mortar used. Usk Castle has several fine examples. The herringbone pattern produces opposing shear plane faces, increasing the relative surface area and therefore rendering it a more sound design for mortar and brick.|$|R
50|$|Around 1732 at Massaponax, Spotswood built {{what may}} have been the first {{purpose-built}} foundry in the British North American Colonies. This was a double-air furnace (usually used to make cannon) and was used to recast pig iron produced at Tubal into final shapes (kettles, andirons, <b>firebacks,</b> etc. and possibly cannon). Neither of Spotswood's iron operations were at Germanna. Spotswood was not, as is commonly believed, involved in the Fredericksville Furnace.|$|R

5000|$|Former Spaghetti Western and peplum star, Richard Harrison, {{appeared}} {{in three of}} Page's films, <b>Fireback,</b> Hunter's Crossing and Blood Debts (1983). Many of his earlier efforts were written or co-written by Watanabe, Kristoff, Gaines or Harrison using a pseudonym. The majority of Page's films have been generally classified as Z-movies, characterized by loose, seemingly improvised narrative (<b>Fireback,</b> for example, is supposed {{to take place in}} the United States, but the setting suddenly changes to [...] "The Jungle" [...] for the last third of the film), bizarre plot twists, and comically bad acting accentuated by equally poor dubbing. Gratuitous, often sadistic violence is mixed with near childlike naivety, with characters having comic book names like [...] "Panther" [...] and [...] "Cat Burglar". Another trademark of the earlier Page films were oversized, customized special weapons, which feature prominently in <b>Fireback</b> and Blood Debts.|$|E
5000|$|Though he {{had married}} in 1843, the duke did not succeed to his title until 1852. In that year, he {{purchased}} the house located at 22 Arlington Street in St. James's, a district of the City of Westminster in central London from Henry Somerset, 7th Duke of Beaufort for Â£60,000. The duke lavished expenses on the house for approximately a decade, including installing iron <b>firebacks</b> with his coronet and motto. Upon his death, the house passed to his widow who sold it to Ivor Guest, 1st Baron Wimborne via auction in 1867.|$|R
25|$|Roach {{was able}} to {{continue}} expanding the business through {{the sale of a}} variety of products, including Franklin stoves, <b>firebacks,</b> slats for iron shutters and other items. In 1856 he added a new steam boiler to the ironworks for driving a blower which forced a draft into the melting furnace, thus obtaining a higher temperature and melting the iron faster, which saved valuable man-hours. He also purchased the adjoining property at 104-106 Goerck St., upon which stood a small three-storey building. Roach used the third floor as a pattern shop, while renting out the first and second floors to an iron shutter manufacturer.|$|R

5000|$|A {{wide range}} of {{accessories}} are used with fireplaces, which range between countries, regions, and historical periods. For the interior, common in recent Western cultures include grates, fireguards, log boxes, andirons, pellet baskets, and fire dogs, all of which cradle fuel and accelerate burning. A grate (or fire grate) is a frame, usually of iron bars, to retain fuel for a fire. Heavy metal <b>firebacks</b> are sometimes used to capture and re-radiate heat, to protect {{the back of the}} fireplace, and as decoration. Fenders are low metal frames set {{in front of the fireplace}} to contain embers, soot and ash. For fireplace tending, tools include pokers, bellows, tongs, shovels, brushes and tool stands. Other wider accessories can include log baskets, companion sets, coal buckets, cabinet accessories and more.|$|R
50|$|The new iron works, {{which was}} called Hammersmith, began {{operations}} in 1646. It {{consisted of a}} blast furnace for producing pig iron and gray iron (the later of which was poured into molds to make <b>firebacks,</b> pots, pans, kettles, and skillets), a forge where pig iron was refined into wrought iron and a 500-pound hammer was used to make merchant bars, which were sold to blacksmiths for manufacture into finished products, and a rolling and slitting mill where flat stock {{that could be used}} to manufacture nails, bolts, horse shoes, wagon tires, axes, saw blades, and other implements was produced. At the time, it was one of the most technologically advanced iron works in the world. Once functioning, the Iron Works ran for thirty weeks of the year and produced one ton of cast iron a day.|$|R
5000|$|The story's {{popularity}} {{was further}} assured after {{it appeared in}} La Fontaine's Fables (I.18). It then began to be applied {{on a number of}} domestic items, including buttons, <b>firebacks,</b> snuff graters, household china and tiles, and on wallpaper. [...] Among the artists who have chosen it as a subject are Frans Snyders (about 1650),Jan van Kessel, senior (1661), Jean-Baptiste Oudry (1747) and his son Jacques-Charles, [...] Hippolyte Lecomte, and Philippe Rousseau (1816-1887). It also features on the right-hand side of Gustav Klimt's [...] "The Fable" [...] (1883). There the fox is accompanied by two storks, one of which has a frog in its beak - in reference to the fable of The Frogs Who Desired a King. In the contemporary fountain sculpture by the Catalan Eduard Batiste Alentorn (1855-1920) in Barcelona's Parc de la Ciutadella, the frustrated fox kicks over the tall vessel, from which the fountain's water pours.|$|R
