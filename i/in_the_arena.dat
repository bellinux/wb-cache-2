5|$|Aerial robots must be {{unmanned}} and autonomous, {{and must}} compete {{based on their}} ability to sense the semi-structured environment of the competition arena. They may be intelligent or preprogrammed, but they must not be controlled by a remote human operator. Computational power need not be carried on the air vehicle itself. Computers operating from standard commercial power may be set up outside the competition arena boundary and uni- or bi-directional data may be transmitted to/from the vehicles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>arena.</b> Size or weight constraints are normally placed on the aerial robots, which must be equipped with a method of manually activated remote override of the primary propulsion system.|$|E

5|$|As a {{criminal}} lawyer who took on dramatic cases, Macdonald got himself noticed {{well beyond the}} narrow confines of the Kingston business community.

And, while there, he was learning the arts of argument and of persuasion that would serve him all his political life.|$|E
5|$|As enemies {{accumulate}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>arena,</b> {{the amount}} of safe space decreases. This, alongside the enemies' aggressive behaviour, encourages constant player movement and spatial awareness. The player character can move at high speed and jump to perform evasive manoeuvres. The game employs advanced movement techniques to increase player speed and jump height. The player can gain a speed boost by strafing while jumping. The shotgun-like blast can supplement the jumping mechanism; the player can be propelled further and perform a double jump by firing downwards while still in the air.|$|E

The entire production {{was shot in}} Russia. In her feature film debut, McDougal's character, Jessemina, is a slave girl who is forced into fighting as a female gladiator in an Ancient Roman colony by its corrupt governor. The role offered McDougal her first opportunity {{to act in a}} dramatic role and to demonstrate her physical abilities with the movie's sword fighting sequences. The movie, initially titled Gladiatrix was deemed to be a knockoff of Gladiator. Although the movie was not well received, it has turned into a lesser known cult film.|$|E
5|$|In May 2001, Oslo City Council {{voted to}} sell their {{properties}} at Fornebu to Fornebu Boligspar (FB), which again had agreements to sell {{a lot for the}} stadium to Stabæk. In November 2002, Borgarting Court of Appeal concluded that Norrønafly had the right to continue leasing a hangar—located at the planned location of the venue—until 2014.

5|$|Moving {{from the}} PlayStation Portable to the PlayStation 3 allowed the {{development}} team {{to add more}} details to the character designs, additional atmospheric sounds, as well as slightly tweak the gameplay system, now allowing camera control with the right analog stick. In addition, the Mirage Arena (a multiplayer component from the original game) has been reworked to only be a single-player experience. Yasue said enemy strengths and AI <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>arena</b> were adjusted to account for this. The inclusion of the Final Mix version in the collection {{marked the first time}} for this version to be released outside Japan.|$|E
5|$|Retiarii first {{appeared}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>arena</b> during the 1st century AD {{and had become}} standard attractions by the 2nd or 3rd century. The gladiator's lack of armour and his reliance on evasive tactics meant that many considered the retiarius the lowliest (and most effeminate) of an already stigmatised (i.e. gladiators) class. Passages from the works of Juvenal, Seneca, and Suetonius suggest that those retiarii who fought in tunics may have constituted an even more demeaned subtype (retiarii tunicati) who were not viewed as legitimate retiarii fighters but as arena clowns. Nevertheless, Roman artwork, graffiti, and grave markers include examples of specific net-men who apparently had reputations as skilled combatants and lovers.|$|E
