"Therefore much pains {{was taken}} on her by ministers {{and others on}} Saturday, Sunday, and Monday morning, that she might resile from that {{confession}} which was suspected to be but a temptation of the devil, to destroy both her soul and body; yea, it was charged home upon her by the ministers, that there was just ground of jealousy that her confession was not sincere, and she was charged before the Lord to declare the truth, and not to take her blood upon her own head. Yet she stiffly adhered to what she had said, and cried always to be put away with the rest. Whereupon, on Monday morning, being called before the judges, and confessing before them what she had said, she was found guilty and condemned to die with the rest that same day. Being carried forth {{to the place of}} execution, she remained silent during the first, second, and third prayer, and then perceiving that there remained no more but to rise and go to the stake, she lifted up her body, and with a loud voice cried out, 'Now all you that see me this day, know that I am now to die as a witch by my own confession, and I free all men, especially the ministers and magistrates, of the guilt of my blood. I take it wholly upon myself--my blood be upon my own head; and as I must make answer to the God of Heaven presently, I declare I am as free of witchcraft as any child; but being delated by a malicious woman, and put in prison under the name of a witch, disowned by my husband and friends, and seeing no ground of hope of my coming out of prison, or ever coming in credit again, through the temptation of the devil I made up that confession on purpose to destroy my own life, being weary of it, and choosing rather to die than live;'--and so died. Which lamentable story, as it did then astonish all the spectators, none of which could restrain themselves from tears; so it may be to all a demonstration of Satan's subtlety, whose design is still to destroy all, partly by tempting many to presumption, and some others to despair. These things to be of truth, are attested by an eye and <b>ear</b> <b>witness</b> who is yet alive, a faithful minister of the gospel."[71] It is strange the inference {{does not seem to have}} been deduced, that as one woman out of very despair renounced her own life, the same might have been the case in many other instances, wherein the confessions of the accused constituted the principal if not sole evidence of the guilt.|$|E

40|$|Elements {{of musical}} {{improvisation}} {{have been present}} throughout the medieval, renaissance, and baroque eras, however, improvisation had the most profound recorded presence in the baroque era. Improvisation is inherently a living practice and leaves little documentation behind for historians to study, but however elusive, {{it is still important}} to trace where instances of this improvised art appear throughout the eras listed above. It is also interesting to trace what role improvisation would later have in realizing the Baroque ideals of emotional expression, virtuosity, and individuality. This paper seeks to focus on a few of the best documented mediums of improvisation within each era. During the medieval period, improvisation took on the form of improvised counterpoint against a plainsong. In the renaissance, improvised harmony of faburden and the contenance angloise is this paper’s selected example. In the Baroque, this study seeks to describe several areas where improvisation appears such as the art of improvised accompaniment from figured bass symbols, the practice of expressive ornamentation on a written melody, and improvised vocal embellishments and cadenzas of the da capo aria. A final aim of this research is to provide examples to clarify the definition of improvisation as {{the degree to which the}} composer of a musical work has given control of its realization to the performer. Treatises and <b>ear</b> <b>witness</b> accounts of improvised musical forms provided primary sources. Other sources used in this research included writings on performance practices of different historical eras and writings on the changing relationship between the composer and the performer. This paper also consults writings on how improvised music was perceived historically as opposed to composed music...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{has three}} main {{objective}}s. The first objective (A) includes Study I, which investigates the parameter fundamental frequency (F 0) and its robustness in different acoustic contexts by using different measures. The outcome concludes that using the alternative baseline {{as a measure}} will diminish the effect of low-quality recordings or varying speaking liveliness. However, both creaky voice and raised vocal effort induce intra-variation problems that are yet to be solved. The second objective (B) includes study II, III and IV. Study II investigates {{the differences between the}} results from an <b>ear</b> <b>witness</b> line-up experiment and the pairwise perceptual judgments of voice similarity performed by a large group of listeners. The study shows that humans seem to be much more focused on similarities of speech style than features connected to voice quality, even when recordings are played backwards. Study III investigates the differences between an automatic voice comparison system and humans’ perceptual judgments of voice similarity. The experiments’ results show {{that it is possible to}} see a correlation between how speakers were judged as more or less different using multidimensional scaling of similarity ranks compared to both the automatic system and the listeners. However, there are also differences due to the fact that human listeners include information about speech style and have difficulties weighting the parameters, i. e. ignoring them when they are contradictory. Study IV successfully investigates a new functional method for how to convert the perceptual similarity judgments made by humans and then compare those to the automatic system results within the likelihood ratio framework. It was discovered that the automatic system outperformed the naïve human listeners in this task (using a very small dataset). The third objective (C) includes study V. Study V investigates several statistical modelling techniques to calculate relevant likelihood ratios using simulations based on existing reference data in an authentic forensic case of a disputed utterance. The study presents several problems with modelling small datasets and develops methods to take into account the lack of data within the likelihood ratio framework. In summary, the thesis contains a larger historical background to forensic speaker comparison to guide the reader into the current research situation within forensic phonetics. The work further seeks to build a bridge between forensic phonetics and automatic voice recognition. Practical casework implications have been considered throughout the work on the basis of own experience as a forensic caseworker and through collaborative interaction with other parties working in the field, both in research and in forensic practice and law enforcement. Since 2005, the author has been involved in over 400 forensic cases and given testimony in several countries...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{significance}} of Sámi and indigenous vocal and musical expression in ethno and indigenous political mobilizing in the 1970 s and particularly in June 1979. My point of departure is the Davvi Šuvva festival; the first Sámi and international indigenous culture and music festival after the establishing of the World Council of Indigenous Peoples. It took place on a hill in a Sámi and Swedish/Finnish border village {{in the north of}} Sweden {{and in the middle of}} Sápmi. My research is based on the interviews with people who organized the festival, artists and audience as well as written contemporary sources, a film about the event and 16 authentic tapes of recordings of the concerts at Davvi Šuvva. The oral sources of eye and <b>ear</b> <b>witnesses</b> represent insider views and experiences and the contemporary written sources of attending news paper journalists and writers from other magazines represent both insider and outsider perspective. “Davvi Šuvva 1979 ” also documents the ethno political background of the festival and discusses various perspectives on collective identity. While powwow dance and traditional native chanting expressed First Nation and Cree Indian identity and Inuit identity was expressed by traditional drum dance and drum singing Davvi Šuvva also demonstrated how yoik conveyed various Sámi identities. My intention is to show how and why vocal and musical expressions had, and still have, a particular significance in oral indigenous cultures as a means of struggle. The conclusions reached are that manifestations of Sámi and indigenous cultural expression and resistance like the Davvi Šuvva festival contributed to pride, recovery, dignity and positive self awareness and that the festival as such strengthened Sámi identity and indigenous togetherness and belonging...|$|R
6000|$|Oh, {{that the}} dear man Luther had but told us here {{what he meant}} by the term, Gospel! That St. Paul had seen even St. Luke's, is but a conjecture, {{grounded}} on a conjectural interpretation of a single text, doubly equivocal; namely, that the Luke mentioned was the same with the Evangelist Luke; and that the 'evangelium' signified a book; the latter, of itself improbable, derives its probability from the undoubtedly very strong probability of the former. If then not any book, much less the four books, now called the four Gospels, were meant by Paul, but the contents of those books, as far as they are veracious, and whatever else was known on equal authority at that time, though not contained in those books; if, in short, the whole sum of Christ's acts and discourses be what Paul meant by the Gospel; then the argument is circuitous, and returns to the first point,--What 'is' the Gospel? Shall we believe you, and not rather the companions of Christ, the eye and <b>ear</b> <b>witnesses</b> of his doings and sayings? Now I should require strong inducements to make me believe that St. Paul had been guilty of such palpably false logic; and I therefore feel myself compelled to infer, that by the Gospel Paul intended the eternal truths known ideally from the beginning, and historically realized in the manifestation of the Word in Christ Jesus; and that he used the ideal immutable truth as the canon and criterion of the oral traditions. For example, a Greek mathematician, standing in the same relation of time and country to Euclid as that in which St. Paul stood to Jesus Christ, might have exclaimed in the same spirit: [...] "What do you talk to me of this, that, and the other intimate acquaintance of Euclid's? My object is to convey the sublime system of geometry which he realized, and by that must I decide." [...] "I," [...] says St. Paul, [...] "have been taught by the spirit of Christ, a teaching susceptible of no addition, and for which no personal anecdotes, however reverendly attested, can be a substitute." [...] But dearest Luther was a translator; he could not, must not, see this.|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between vocal characteristics and perceived age {{is of interest}} in various contexts, as is the possibility to affect age perception through vocal manipulation. A few examples of such situations are when age is staged by actors, when <b>ear</b> <b>witnesses</b> make age assessments based on vocal cues only or when offenders disguise their voice to appear younger or older. This paper investigates how speakers spontaneously manipulate two age related vocal characteristics (f 0 and speech rate) in attempt to sound younger versus older than their true age, and if the manipulation corresponds to actual age related changes in f 0 and speech rate (Study 1). Further aims of the paper is to determine how successful vocal age disguise is by asking listeners to estimate the age of generated speech samples (Study 2) and to examine whether or not listeners use f 0 and speech rate as cues to perceived age. In Study 1, participants from three age groups (20 - 25, 40 - 45 and 60 - 65 years) agreed to read a short text under three voice conditions. There were 12 speakers in each age group (six women and six men). They used their natural voice in one condition, attempted to sound 20 years younger in another and 20 years older in a third condition. In Study 2, 60 participants (listeners) listened to speech samples from the three voice conditions in Study 1 and estimated the speakers’ age. Each listener was exposed to all three voice conditions. The results from Study 1 indicated that the speakers increased fundamental frequency (f 0) and speech rate when attempting to sound younger and decreased f 0 and speech rate when attempting to sound older. Study 2 showed that the voice manipulations had an effect in the sought-after direction, although the achieved mean effect was only 3 years, which is {{far less than the}} intended effect of 20 years. Moreover, listeners used speech rate, but not f 0, as a cue to speaker age. It was concluded that age disguise by voice can be achieved by naïve speakers even though the perceived effect was smaller than intended...|$|R
6000|$|... --First {{permit me}} to remove a very natural, indeed almost inevitable, mistake, {{relative}} to my lectures; namely, that I 'have' them, or that the lectures of one place or season are in any way repeated in another. So far from it, that on any point that I had ever studied (and on no other should I dare discourse--I mean, that I would not lecture on any subject for which I had to 'acquire' the main knowledge, even though a month's or three months' previous time were allowed me; on no subject that had not employed my thoughts for {{a large portion of}} my life since earliest manhood, free of all outward and particular purpose)--on any point within my habit of thought, I should greatly prefer a subject I had never lectured on, to one which I had repeatedly given; and those who have attended me for any two seasons successively will bear witness, that the lecture given at the London Philosophical Society, on the 'Romeo and Juliet', for instance, was as different from that given at the Crown and Anchor, {{as if they had been}} by two individuals who, without any communication with each other, had only mastered the same principles of philosophic criticism. This was most strikingly evidenced in the coincidence between my lectures and those of Schlegel; such, and so close, that it was fortunate for my moral reputation that I had not only from five to seven hundred <b>ear</b> <b>witnesses</b> that the passages had been given by me at the Royal Institution two years before Schlegel commenced his lectures at Vienna, but that notes had been taken of these by several men and ladies of high rank. The fact is this; during a course of lectures, I faithfully employ all the intervening days in collecting and digesting the materials, whether I have or have not lectured on the same subject before, making no difference. The day of the lecture, till the hour of commencement, I devote to the consideration, what of the mass before me is best fitted to answer the purposes of a lecture, that is, to keep the audience awake and interested during the delivery, and to leave a sting behind, that is, a disposition to study the subject anew, under the light of a new principle. Several times, however, partly from apprehension respecting my health and animal spirits, partly from the wish to possess copies that might afterwards be marketable among the publishers, I have previously written the lecture; but before I had proceeded twenty minutes, I have been obliged to push the MS. away, and give the subject a new turn. Nay, this was so notorious, that many of my auditors used to threaten me, when they saw any number of written papers on my desk, to steal them away; declaring they never felt so secure of a good lecture as when they perceived that I had not a single scrap of writing before me. I take far, far more pains than would go to the set composition of a lecture, both by varied reading and by meditation; but for the words, illustrations, &c., I know almost as little as any one of the audience (that is, those of anything like the same education with myself) what they will be five minutes before the lecture begins. Such is my way, for such is my nature; and in attempting any other, I should only torment myself in order to disappoint my auditors--torment myself during the delivery, I mean; for in all other respects it would be a much shorter and easier task to deliver them from writing. I am anxious to preclude any semblance of affectation; and have therefore troubled you with this lengthy preface before I have the hardihood to assure you, that you might as well ask me what my dreams were in the year 1814, as what my course of lectures was at the Surrey Institution.|$|R

So blame me, and by no means another poet, and I will humbly confess that I deserve to be blamed in some measure.

There was also one Freeman, (who was more than an ordinary Doctor) sent for, to cast out this Devil; and I was there when he attempted to do it. The manner whereof was this. They had the possessed into an out- room, and laid him on his belly upon a Form, with his head hanging over the Forms end; then they bound him down thereto: which done, they set a pan of Coals under his mouth, and put something therein which made a great smoak; by this means (as 'twas said) to fetch out the Devil. There therefore they kept the man till he was almost smothered in the smoak, but no Devil came out of him; at which Freeman was somewhat abashed, the man greatly afflicted, and I made to go away wondering and fearing. In a little time therefore that which possessed the man, carried him out of the World, according to the cursed Wishes of his Son. And this was the end of this hellish mirth.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{is a brief}} {{survey and}} {{interpretation}} of {{the text of the}} only two heraclitean fragments that connect explicitly psuche and logos, B 45 and B 115. Introductory pages deal with the traditional significance of the word psuche, and the meaning and philosophical importance of the complex term of logos, which appears in several other genuine texts. Part I is concerned with B 45 : “If you go to the soul’s limits, you wouldn’t find them, even if you traveled every path: so deep is its logos”. It is mainly an exploration of its many different resonances and its paradoxical rationality. The focal points of attention are the ideas of “limits” and “searching”, which are then linked to mortality. The second section includes brief discussion on B 36, and concludes that its relevancy to the interpretation of B 45 is questionable and unclear. The third section tries to recover the general outlines of Heraclitus conception of [human] soul as the home of knowledge and speech (as a quick glimpse of B 107 reveals [“Eyes and <b>ears</b> are bad <b>witnesses</b> for those who have barbarous souls”]), which strongly suggests the idea of self-knowledge as the background of B 45. The last section deals with the more difficult B 115 (“It belongs to the soul a logos that increases itself”), recognizing first the problem of authenticity, and especially the objection of inconsistency between the idea of a logos that “increases itself” and Heraclitus’ theory of “measures”, venturing a conjectural interpretation that draws attention to the main, common point of both fragments: the inner character of logos, its immanency in psuche, and its most suggestive implication, an idea of self-conciousness, a fundamental philosophical notion that could be thus much more ancient than what is usually thought...|$|R
5000|$|Ferguson, {{unable to}} secure the first guard, found {{it much easier to}} pass the second. After {{ascending}} to the second floor, Ferguson left his own guard at the steps to stop anyone who might come looking for him. Three Confederate soldiers came into the room of Orange Sells, Lieutenant Smith, and Captain Dagenfeld, of the 12th Ohio Cavalry. Ferguson, flanked by one unknown man, and Hildreth, (rank unknown), walked into the room without saying a word, pulled out his musket and stopped directly in front of Sells's bed. Lieutenant Smith recognized Ferguson as he reached {{the middle of the floor}} and moaned, [...] "Champ, is that you?" [...] Ferguson made no reply, but jerked his gun up to point at Smith and hit the breech with his right hand. He then looked at Smith and asked, [...] "Smith, do you see this?" [...] Smith then begged Ferguson not to shoot saying, [...] "Champ, for God's sake, don’t shoot me here." [...] Ferguson then put the gun to Smith's head and shot three times before the gun went off. The ball hit Smith in the side of the forehead and went through the other <b>ear.</b> Five <b>witnesses</b> in the hospital testified at the trial of Champ Ferguson that they heard or saw Ferguson shoot Smith. Even the Rebel quartermaster's sergeant, A.J. Watkins, testified that he saw Smith dead in his bed promptly after hearing a shot. No one said anything after Smith begged Ferguson not to shoot. Ferguson's partner in crime at the hospital, Hildreth, had been watching the event with a carbine in one hand and a pistol in the other guarding the Federal wounded in the room. After the shot, Hildreth turned to Ferguson and said, [...] "Champ, be sure your work is well done." [...] After examining the body, Ferguson concluded, [...] "He is damned dead." [...] Dr. Murfree was at the office of the hospital when a nurse came in saying a lot of soldiers had killed a man in the hospital. Dr. Murfree and Major Stringfield, an officer in the Army of Virginia, took off to the hospital. Upon reaching the hospital, the pair was confronted by one of Ferguson's men that was guarding the steps with drawn revolvers. Dr. Murfree told the man to go downstairs, but the man replied that Captain Ferguson had ordered him to no let anyone pass. Dr. Murfree pushed past the guard while Major Stringfield remained behind to contend with the guard. Dr. Murfree met Ferguson on the next set of steps flanked by his armed guard. Ferguson was yelling loudly that he intended to kill all the Federal officers in Smith's room. This included Colonel Hanson of the 37th Kentucky Volunteers, and Captain Degenfeld of the 12th Ohio Cavalry. Dr. Murfree exclaimed, [...] "Gentlemen, you must go down from here; this is a place for the sick and wounded, and you must not disturb them," [...] to which Ferguson retorted, [...] "I will shoot you." [...] Dr. Murfree repeated his sentiment, stating that he was in charge of the hospital before Champ Ferguson advanced to within three feet of Dr. Murfree and said, [...] "I don’t care who you are, damn you, I will kill you." [...] Abruptly, Lieutenant Philpot, of Ferguson's company stepped in between the pair and motioned that they should leave. The group then mounted their horses and rode off shouting, [...] "We have killed the man that killed Hamilton." [...] The most interesting point that Dr. Murfree makes is that the group ran off yelling that they had avenged Hamilton. One other witness made reference to Captain Hamilton in the trial of Champ Ferguson. This circumstance refutes Sensing's conclusions that he was murdered due to his heinous acts.|$|R
