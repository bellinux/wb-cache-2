Alaskan king crab fishing reported over 300 fatalities per 100,000 as of 2005, with over 80% of those deaths caused by drowning or hypothermia.|$|E

50|$|When the {{slickline}} parts, {{this can}} create an expensive 'fishing' job.

Because of the downtime involved in 'fishing', meaning not being able to flow the oil/gas well, the client is losing money by lack of production and also the cost of the slickline unit to fish, and the cost of what is left in the hole if it is not fished out (in the oil/gas industry, if the cause of the <b>fishing</b> <b>job</b> was not the fault of the slickline company, the oil/gas company is usually responsible to pay for it, and it can be very expensive).|$|E

30|$|The San Vito- 1 {{well was}} drilled in 1980 without any major {{challenges}} up to 2000  m depth {{due to the}} experience already gained from the other three high-temperature drilling projects in the Mofete field. The first <b>fishing</b> <b>job</b> at 2330  m resulted {{in some parts of}} equipment left inside the wellbore. The well was side-tracked just below the 9 5 / 8 ″ production casing. Mud gelling and coagulation was experienced at 2488  m. An attempt of freeing the drill string with explosive materials failed due to high temperatures decomposing the explosive charges. Another attempt of side-tracking the well with coil tubing also failed and another ‘fish’ was left inside the hole. A back-off fishing procedure proved to be successful at 2013  m; however, around 400  m of drill string was left at the well bottom. Drilling was later continued to 3045  m and completed at the same depth with slotted liner pipe. At 2500  m, only the melting of zinc samples was successful in registering well temperatures of about 419  °C. Production tests were attempted; however, the well showed a rapid increase of temperature at the wellhead, which was not rated for temperatures in excess of 300  °C. The San Vito- 1 well was eventually killed (Baron and Ungemach 1980). Later analysis from purge test results proved that reservoir fluid from the San Vito- 1 well had a pH level of 3.2 (De Vito et al. 1989) proving aggressive downhole environment.|$|E

Indian fisheries sector provide dependency for over 14. 5 million {{people across the country}} with Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala, being the top three marine fish producing states of the country. Even possessing the highest literacy rate in the country, the irony exists that the fishers of Kerala are marginalized far way behind with comparatively higher level of literacy rate and educational attainment which limits them with minimal alternative livelihood options. This study is an attempt to examine the socio-economic profile of the fishing community in the Poonthura fishing village of the Thiruvananthapuram district of Kerala, where fishing is the most important economic activity. Among the 222 fishing villages of Kerala, Thiruvananthapuram has the maximum number of marine fishing villages (19 per cent) where in fishermen reside. Poonthura village {{is one of the major}} fishing villages from the South West hotspot regions of India, situated in the suburbs of Thiruvananthapuram district, the capital of Kerala. The study analyzed various socioeconomic aspects such as thefishing activity, basic household data, economic as well as historic and cultural dependence on fishing, gender equity, employment and occupational structure, community infrastructure, income distribution and assets, physical capital, financial capital, social capital, and exposure of the fishermen families by taking 500 samples from the study area.

40|$|ABSTRACT Title of Dissertation: ANALYZING THE IMPACT OF PARTICIPATORY PLANNED CONSERVATION POLICIES IN THE NEGRIL ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AREA, WESTERN JAMAICA 			 	 Lovette Miller Anderson, Doctor of Philosophy, 2007 Dissertation {{directed}} by: 	Professor Ruth Defries									Department of Geography This dissertation research {{sought to}} determine {{the ways in which}} the participatory-planned conservation policies influence changes in local populations' natural resource use. The research took place in the Negril Environmental Protection Area, western Jamaica and covered the period 1990 to 2005. The two major questions asked were 1) In what ways do participatory-planned conservation policies influence changes in the protected area's natural resource use? 2) How does group membership and demography influence the perception of the conservation policies and of changes in natural resource use? The research employed trend analyses, content analyses, a population survey, discriminant analyses and semi-structured interviews to answer the research questions. In general, the research finds that national socioeconomic development interests were given priority over the participatory-planned conservation policies. The changes in local populations' natural resource use were primarily due to the national socioeconomic policies that were in place prior to the protected area designation as well as those that were implemented during the study period. Second, the research finds that, in general, groups that have shared histories were homogeneous in their views of conservation and/or development. In contrast, newer entrants to the protected area were generally heterogeneous in their views of conservation and/or development. Further, the research finds that changes in the demographic characteristics of local populations significantly influence the perception of conservation and development. For example, respondents who were relatively new to the protected area generally had a positive perception of conservation and of the decline in <b>fishing</b> <b>jobs.</b> In contrast, respondents who have lived there relatively longer had a negative perception of conservation and of the decline in <b>fishing</b> <b>jobs.</b> By examining the complexity of implementing the participatory-planned conservation policies in Negril's postcolonial and non-colonial socioeconomic and political landscape, this research extends the discourse on protected areas from large, relatively low populated areas to the complex geographic landscapes that currently describe some newer protected areas...|$|R

40|$|This report {{examines}} {{economic and}} social impacts {{of the first two}} years of crab rationalization on the Aleutians East Borough communities of King Cove, Akutan and False Pass. The study was conducted by the University of Alaska Institute of Social and Economic Research (ISER) for the Aleutians East Borough (AEB) and the City of King Cove. The report is based on a literature review, interviews conducted during visits to each study community, analysis of federal and state and local fisheries data and community data, and a household survey conducted by the City of King Cove. The primary focus of the study is on King Cove, because it is a larger community which has experienced greater effects of crab rationalization. Crab rationalization resulted in dramatic consolidation in Bering Sea crab fisheries. During {{the first two years of}} rationalization, consolidation reduced the number of boats participating in the Bristol Bay Red King Crab fishery and the Bering Sea Snow Crab fishery by about two-thirds.

50|$|The Plains aborigines {{have once}} owned {{extensive}} space for agriculture and hunting. They solved their disputes {{by means of}} betel-nuts treats, apologies or fights. They led a life of self-sufficiency without restriction and suppression from outside regulations or foreign armies. For a very long time, {{before the arrival of}} the Han Chinese, the Plains aborigines only used simple agricultural tools, such as sticks and spades, to plant millet, taro and yam. And they only produced what they required for living. Without knowledge of fertiliser, they always found new lands to plant when the land was exhausted. In addition, they still lived on primitive ways of fishing and hunting. The hunting methods included traps, spears and arrows. And they used nets, baskets and arrows for fishing. Usually, women were responsible for farming, while young men took on hunting and <b>fishing</b> <b>jobs.</b> Their hunting targets were mainly deer and wild boars. There were regular seasons for hunting deer and it was prohibited to hunt young deer, {{in order to maintain the}} ecological balance. When the Dutch occupied Taiwan, they have taught the Plains aborigines farming skills and administered a policy of breeding farm cattle. They indirectly ruled the indigenes and managed the land cultivation. After the improvement of farming skills, the Plains aborigines changed their crop into rice. This happened more obviously to the southern tribes that had earlier contacts with foreigners. The northern tribes still planted millet mostly until the early Qing period.|$|R
