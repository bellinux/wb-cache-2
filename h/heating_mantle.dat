50|$|A <b>heating</b> <b>mantle,</b> or isomantle, is a {{piece of}} {{laboratory}} equipment used to apply heat to containers, as an alternative to other forms of heated bath. In contrast to other heating devices, such as hotplates or Bunsen burners, glassware containers may be placed in direct contact with the <b>heating</b> <b>mantle</b> without substantially increasing the risk of the glassware shattering, because the heating element of a <b>heating</b> <b>mantle</b> is insulated from the container so as to prevent excessive temperature gradients. Heating mantles may have various forms. In a common arrangement, electric wires are embedded within a strip of fabric that can be wrapped around a flask. The current supplied to the device, and hence the temperature achieved, is regulated by a rheostat. This type of <b>heating</b> <b>mantle</b> is quite useful for maintaining an intended temperature within a separatory funnel, for example, after the contents of a reaction have been removed from a primary heat source.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In the United States, {{the surface}} heat flow can be {{separated}} into two main components. The first component {{is due to}} radioactive heat sources in the upper crust, and the second component is due to sources in the lower crust and upper <b>mantle.</b> The <b>heat</b> flow from the lower crust and upper mantle is constant over large regions, called heat flow provinces, and the transitions between provinces are very narrow (less than 100 km). High values of <b>mantle</b> <b>heat</b> flow (> 1. 4 ìcal/cm 2 sec) occur in the Basin and Range, Columbia Plateaus, Northern Rocky Mountains, Southern Rocky Mountains physiographic provinces, and in the Franciscan rocks east of the San Andreas fault zone. Normal or near-normal <b>mantle</b> <b>heat</b> flow (0. 8) {{is found in the}} United States east of the Rocky Mountains, in the Colorado Plateaus, the Southern California batholith, and in the Puget Sound Region. Subnormal <b>mantle</b> <b>heat</b> flow (0. 4, the lowest known anywhere) occurs in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.
