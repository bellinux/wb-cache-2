50|$|Dunne {{believed}} that he experienced precognitive dreams. The first he records occurred in 1898, in which he dreamed of the time on his watch before waking up and checking it. Several such experiences, some quite dramatic, led him to undertake a scientific investigation into the phenomenon. Based on years of experimentation with such precognitive dreams and <b>hypnagogic</b> <b>states,</b> both on himself and on others, he claimed that in such states, the mind was not shackled to the present {{and was able to}} perceive events in the past and future with equal facility. He used this to support his new theory of time and consciousness. His landmark An Experiment with Time (1927) recounts the story and also includes his account of the theory of serial time. It has been frequently reprinted.|$|R

5000|$|Naturally, amnesia {{contributes}} {{to the difficulty of}} studying hypnagogia, as does the typically fleeting nature of hypnagogic experiences. These problems have been tackled by experimenters in a number of ways, including voluntary or induced interruptions, sleep manipulation, the use of techniques to [...] "hover on the edge of sleep" [...] thereby extending the duration of the <b>hypnagogic</b> <b>state,</b> and training in the art of introspection to heighten the subject's powers of observation and attention.|$|E
5000|$|A {{hypnopompic}} state (or hypnopomp) {{is the state}} of consciousness leading out of sleep, a term coined by the psychical researcher Frederic Myers. Its mirror is the <b>hypnagogic</b> <b>state</b> at sleep onset; though often conflated, the two states are not identical. The <b>hypnagogic</b> <b>state</b> is rational waking cognition {{trying to make sense of}} non-linear images and associations; the {{hypnopompic state}} is emotional and credulous dreaming cognition trying to make sense of real world [...] They have a different phenomenological character. Depressed frontal lobe function in the first few minutes after waking - known as [...] "sleep inertia" [...] - causes slowed reaction time and impaired short-term memory. Sleepers often wake confused, or speak without making sense, a phenomenon the psychologist Peter McKeller calls [...] "hypnopompic speech". When the awakening occurs out of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, in which most dreams occur, the hypnopompic state is sometimes accompanied by lingering vivid imagery. Some of the creative insights attributed to dreams actually happen in this moment of awakening from REM. In Deirdre Barrett's The Committee of Sleep, Margie Profet's McArthur-award winning biology experiment is shown to be one of these.|$|E
50|$|Proprioception is {{occasionally}} impaired spontaneously, {{especially when}} one is tired.

These effects are presumed to arise from abnormal stimulation of the part of the parietal cortex of the brain involved with integrating information from different parts of the body.|$|E

40|$|Near-death {{experiences}} (NDEs) are {{an intriguing}} and somewhat awkward {{topic in the}} scientific medicine. They {{can be defined as}} the memory of impressions occurring during life-threatening conditions, including a number of special elements such as out-of-body experiences, pleasant feelings, seeing a tunnel, a light, deceased relatives, or a life review. Their transcendent tonality leads one to consider them a priori as doubtful or non-existent, not relevant, or a matter of psychiatric or organic disturbances at most. The available interpretations of NDEs, despite being scientifically sound, so far remain only speculations or, at best, clues without any demonstration, while others are not even plausible or neglect facts incompatible with the ruling mechanistic and reductionistic view, showing the deep epistemological implications of their explanation. In the past few decades NDEs, hypnosis, relaxation, and meditation have been included among the so-called altered states of consciousness (ASC), together with other physiological and pathological conditions, such as dreaming, sensory deprivation, <b>hypnagogic</b> <b>states,</b> epilepsy, effects of hallucinogens, and psychotic symptoms. However, the very term ASC, semantically suggesting abnormality, looks to be questionable for physiological mind activities like hypnosis and meditation. NDEs and hypnosis appear as two entirely distinct phenomena, but some common processes probably tinge them. Hypnosis has seldom been used to evoke previous NDEs in an attempt to relive them; conversely, NDE-like experiences have been induced in hypnosis in the context of psychotherapy with the aim of approximating their transformational therapeutic aspects and facilitating both first- and second-order patient changes. Fortunately, an increasing dissatisfaction has emerged in recent years with our merely organic medicine, which has been paralleled by a growing interest in consciousness, subjectivity, and spirituality. There is an increasing need to reappraise our paradigm and the still mysterious mind–brain–world relationship; the so-called ASC also call for a broader approach, to reappraise them in a perspective, including their still misunderstood physiology, merging mechanisms, contents, and meanings in a whole without prejudices, not even scientific ones...|$|R
40|$|So-called altered {{states of}} {{consciousness}} (ASC) are an intriguing, still under-researched topic, with profound neuropsychological and epistemological implications. In {{the last few decades}} there has been increasing multidisciplinary interest in consciousness and ASC, a term encompassing a wide range of pathological and non-pathological conditions, including dreaming, near-death experiences (NDEs), <b>hypnagogic</b> <b>states,</b> hallucinogenic experiences, epileptic seizures, psychotic symptoms, coma, and minimally conscious states. There has also been considerable research on procedures that may affect ASC including hypnosis and various forms of meditation. Since the term altered implies for some abnormality or dysfunction, the concept of anomalous experiences (not necessarily implying pathology) is increasingly used and more general. The term non-ordinary mental expressions (NOME) encompasses both anomalous (at least for a particular culture at a particular time) experiences and related neuropsychological processes and induction procedures. Our use of non-ordinary: a) does not assume pathology; and b) is suitable for sophisticated and positive mental activities, including, creativity, intuition, and some forms of spirituality. We use the term mind to include both conscious and preconscious processes, and question the notion that, "ordinary", waking consciousness provides the only epistemologically valid stance with regard to the mind and its interactions with reality. Similarly, although genius and madness both imply something beyond normal, they differ importantly in their ontology and implications. In short, NOME refers to both experiences and procedures that seek to change short- or long-term psychological processes. Regarding the latter, meditation is an intentional activity, calling for training of attention and reflective awareness, and varying in specific procedures and outcomes. With regard to an absence of pathology, NDEs, which have several features in common with mystical experiences, may occur {{in the absence of any}} brain disorder and bring about positive changes. Reductionist interpretations of NDEs as pathophysiological do not explain nor encompass the whole range of their phenomenology. Instead, brain areas and neurotransmitters potentially involved in these experiences may provide a common terrain for both pathological and non-pathological mind expressions. We believe that a proper approach to NOME should adopt a neurophenomenological approach to the study of brain mechanisms and subjective experiences as a whole, integrating experiential and neuroscientific perspectives, without any a priori fixed hierarchy or ontology. The brain-mind relationship can be analyzed as a recursive loop, where brain activity gives rise to mental phenomena and mental processes, in turn, yield functional and plastic changes in the brain. This Research Topic will include international experts in NOME as well as young researchers within a multidisciplinary discussion, in which neuroscientists, psychologists, psychiatrists, philosophers, anthropologists, and other professionals will be asked to contribute. We aim to reappraise the importance of NOME and its implications for the mind-brain-world relationship. The editors will solicit original research contributions as well as theoretical papers, such as reviews, mini-reviews, and theoretical discussions...|$|R

Drawing primary inspiration from reading about the ambient ‘happenings’ of Robert Rich in California in the 1980 s - these were immersive all-night shows, performed to sleeping audiences, that stretched the definition of a ‘concert’ beyond all familiar limits. These much-mythologised happenings are part physical experience, part community intervention, part scientific experiment, part mystic ritual. Macpherson and Mayall, along with cellist Yotam Levy will perform a synthesis of found sound, prepared drones, and live instrumental playing. The focus of the event is around everything being very slow. Anything resembling a melody might unfold over a half an hour or so. The concentration is really one of subtlety, slowness, extremely drawn out transitions, and exploring an unfolding sense of continuity.

50|$|The <b>hypnagogic</b> <b>state</b> {{can provide}} insight into a problem, the best-known example being August Kekulé’s {{realization}} that the structure of benzene was a closed ring while half-asleep {{in front of a}} fire and seeing molecules forming into snakes, one of which grabbed its tail in its mouth. Many other artists, writers, scientists and inventors — including Beethoven, Richard Wagner, Walter Scott, Salvador Dalí, Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla and Isaac Newton — have credited hypnagogia and related states with enhancing their creativity. A 2001 study by Harvard psychologist Deirdre Barrett found that, while problems can also be solved in full-blown dreams from later stages of sleep, hypnagogia was especially likely to solve problems which benefit from hallucinatory images being critically examined while still before the eyes.|$|E
5000|$|Thought {{processes}} on {{the edge}} of sleep tend to differ radically from those of ordinary wakefulness. For example, something that you agreed with in a state of Hypnagogia may seem completely ridiculous to you in an awake state. Hypnagogia may involve a [...] "loosening of ego boundaries ... openness, sensitivity, internalization-subjectification of the physical and mental environment (empathy) and diffuse-absorbed attention." [...] Hypnagogic cognition, in comparison with that of normal, alert wakefulness, is characterized by heightened suggestibility, illogic and a fluid association of ideas. Subjects are more receptive in the <b>hypnagogic</b> <b>state</b> to suggestion from an experimenter than at other times, and readily incorporate external stimuli into hypnagogic trains of thought and subsequent dreams. This receptivity has a physiological parallel; EEG readings show elevated responsiveness to sound around the onset of sleep.|$|E
5000|$|A Dreamachine is [...] "viewed" [...] {{with the}} eyes closed: the {{pulsating}} light stimulates the optic nerve and thus alters the brain's electrical oscillations. Users experience increasingly bright, complex patterns of color behind their closed eyelids (a similar effect may be experienced when travelling as a passenger in a car or bus; close your eyes as the vehicle passes through flickering shadows cast by roadside trees, or under a close-set line of streetlights or tunnel striplights). The patterns become shapes and symbols, swirling around, until the user feels surrounded by colors. It is claimed that by using a Dreamachine one may enter a <b>hypnagogic</b> <b>state.</b> [...] This experience may sometimes be quite intense, but to escape from it, one needs only to open one's eyes.The Dreamachine may be dangerous for persons with photosensitive epilepsy or other nervous disorders.

5000|$|The {{technique}} of embodied imagination takes dreaming as the paradigm for all work with images.

Bosnak describes how a dream [...] "instantaneously presents a total world, so real that you are convinced you are awake. You don't just think so, you know it in the same way you now know you are awake reading this book." [...] So from the perspective of dreaming, the image is a place. [...] Based on this notion, the dreamer can re-enter the landscape of the dream and flash back into its images to more fully and deeply explore and experience them. The dreamer explores the images of the dream while in a <b>hypnagogic</b> <b>state,</b> a state of consciousness between waking and sleeping. While in this state, the dreamer is asked a series of questions that help him or her to re-experience the dream by describing details of its landscape and image.|$|E
