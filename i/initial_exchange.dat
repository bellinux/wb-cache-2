5|$|The battle {{occurred}} in stages: an <b>initial</b> <b>exchange</b> of artillery fire, a minor charge by Confederate Brig. Gen. Lewis Armistead, and three successive waves of Confederate infantry charges triggered by unclear orders from Lee and {{the actions of}} Maj. Gens. Magruder and D. H. Hill, respectively. In each phase, {{the effectiveness of the}} Federal artillery was the deciding factor, repulsing attack after attack, resulting in a tactical Union victory. After the battle, McClellan and his forces withdrew from Malvern Hill to Harrison's Landing, where he remained until August 16. His plan to capture Richmond had been thwarted.|$|E

The latter ship required less than a month of repairs but Conqueror was not ready for service until March 1915.|$|E

5|$|The first {{attack on}} Île de la Passe was {{launched}} {{on the evening}} of 10 August, with Staunch towing boats carrying over 400 soldiers, Royal Marines and volunteer sailors to the island under cover of darkness, guided by Nereides pilot. During the night however, the pilot became lost and the boats were scattered in high winds and had not reassembled by dawn. To distract French attention from the drifting boats, Pym directed Captain Henry Lambert in Iphigenia to sail conspicuously off Port Napoleon, where {{the main body of the}} French squadron, led by Hamelin in Vénus, was based. Pym joined Lambert later in the day and the frigates subsequently returned to the waters of Grand Port by different routes, confusing French observers from the shore as to British intentions. By 13 August, the boats originally intended for the attack had still not been assembled and Pym decided that he could not risk waiting any longer without the French launching a counterattack. Launching his own boats at 8:00 pm, guided by the pilot and commanded by Pym's second in command, Lieutenant Norman, Pym's marines and sailors landed on the island in darkness under heavy fire from the defenders. Norman was killed in the <b>initial</b> <b>exchange</b> of fire, but his deputy, Lieutenant Watling, seized the island by storming the fortifications surrounding the battery. Seven British personnel were killed and 18 wounded in the battle, in which the storming party managed to seize intact French naval code books and took 80 prisoners. Willoughby was furious that Pym had assumed command of the operation without his permission and the officers exchanged angry letters, part of an ongoing disagreement between them that engendered mutual distrust.|$|E

500|$|The parties {{met at the}} {{homestead}} of Henry D. Brewer three miles (4.8km) north of Grangeville (which is near Hanford), the marshal's group having just been at Braden's house. Later testimony from uninvolved parties indicated that the party of settlers were lightly armed and had every intention of persuading the railroad party to delay their actions until a pending court case could be resolved. However, there was bad blood between Crow and Harris, and Hartt had previously threatened to kill any [...] "sandlappers" [...] (a derisive term for homesteaders, equivalent to the modern day [...] "redneck"), and an argument broke out between them. Harris and Hartt simultaneously opened fire at each other. Crow, a skilled marksman who was armed with a shotgun, singlehandedly killed or wounded most of the settlers' party. After the <b>initial</b> <b>exchange</b> of gunfire ended, Crow fled the scene, but {{was shot in the}} back about [...] away by an unknown assailant before he could reach safety. Poole and Clark did not participate in the battle and left immediately after the incident, possibly defusing tensions enough to avoid further bloodshed.|$|E

2500|$|The second {{engagement}} at Hsin Ho {{occurred on}} the night of April 4–5, 1947, and it would be the last major clash between American and Communist forces during Operation Beleaguer. A party of Communist raiders with an estimated strength of 350 men made a [...] "planned and coordinated attack" [...] on three isolated points of the dump's perimeter. Five Americans were killed in the <b>initial</b> <b>exchange</b> of gunfire, and the Communists broke into the ammunition storage area. Eight more Americans were wounded as the heavily outnumbered guard detachment attempted to defend the dump. According to their plans, the Chinese used horse-drawn carts and pack animals to haul away captured ammunition, and they also set up an ambush on the road to Tangku, where American reinforcements would arrive from.|$|E
2500|$|Specific {{details of}} what {{triggered}} the massacre are debated. According to some accounts, Yellow Bird began to perform the Ghost Dance, telling the Lakota that their [...] "ghost shirts" [...] were bulletproof. As tensions mounted, Black Coyote {{refused to give up}} his rifle; he was deaf and had not understood the order. Another Indian said: [...] "Black Coyote is deaf." [...] (Black Coyote did not speak English.) When the soldier persisted, he said, [...] "Stop. He cannot hear your orders." [...] At that moment, two soldiers seized Black Coyote from behind, and (allegedly) in the struggle, his rifle discharged. At the same moment, Yellow Bird threw some dust into the air, and approximately five young Lakota men with concealed weapons threw aside their blankets and fired their rifles at Troop K of the 7th. After this <b>initial</b> <b>exchange,</b> the firing became indiscriminate.|$|E
2500|$|At Fort McHenry, some 1000 {{soldiers}} {{under the}} command of Major George Armistead awaited the British naval bombardment. Their defense was augmented by the sinking of a line of American merchant ships at the adjacent entrance to Baltimore Harbor in order to thwart passage of British ships. The attack began on the morning of September 13, as the British fleet of some nineteen ships began pounding the fort with rockets and mortar shells. After an <b>initial</b> <b>exchange</b> of fire, the British fleet withdrew just beyond the [...] range of Fort McHenry's cannons. For the next 25 hours, they bombarded the outmanned Americans. On the morning of September 14, an oversized American flag, which had been raised before daybreak, flew over Fort McHenry. The British knew that victory had eluded them. The bombardment of the fort inspired Francis Scott Key, a native of Frederick, Maryland, to write [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] as witness to the assault. It later became the country's national anthem.|$|E

2500|$|This was an {{extremely}} important accomplishment as American military commands in the Pacific {{had no idea that}} there was any effective armed resistance on Mindanao or even in the Philippines. General Charles Willoughby, MacArthur's intelligence chief, had assured him that there was no possibility of such. The American command in the Pacific first heard of Fertig when the Japanese announced that a bombing mission had killed [...] "Major General Fertig," [...] but the Americans simply dismissed it as propaganda. It took weeks before American intelligence was able to confirm who Fertig was, and that he was alive and not operating as an agent of the Japanese. Part of this investigative process involved Mary Fertig who was contacted for personal information on her husband's life. Mrs. Fertig was actually in receipt of a letter that her husband had sent on the last American plane leaving Mindanao. A phrase in the letter, [...] "Pineapples for Breakfast", let Mrs. Fertig know that her husband was alive and well on Mindanao, as that is where they spent short vacations and, while there, he enjoyed having pineapples for breakfast. The latest American intelligence had placed Fertig on Corregidor {{at the time of the}} surrender, and so the U.S. Army assumed that he was either dead or a prisoner of the Japanese. In February 1943, with tenuous communication established, General MacArthur appointed Fertig as Commanding Officer of the 10th Military District on Mindanao. During the <b>initial</b> <b>exchange</b> of messages, MacArthur disallowed any promotion of American armed forces personnel in the Philippines to general rank. As a result, Fertig [...] "reduced" [...] himself in rank to colonel, but continued wearing the brigadier general stars fashioned for him by a Filipino metalsmith.|$|E
