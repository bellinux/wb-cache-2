5|$|In 1928, {{a second}} PL-8, and {{equipped}} with a Hispano-Suiza 12M, 375kW (500hp) <b>engine,</b> <b>was</b> built.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, the RB.106 {{program was}} cancelled, necessitating {{the use of}} the backup Wright J67 engine instead. In 1955, this <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> also cancelled, leaving the design with no engine. At this point, the Pratt & Whitney J75 was {{selected}} for the initial test-flight models, while the new TR 13 <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> developed at Orenda for the production Mk 2s.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{also suffered}} from engine problems, however, {{that were not}} so easily cured; the Ranger <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> well known for unreliability, and was particularly prone to overheating problems that were never satisfactoriarly solved. The aircraft's original XV-770-4 <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> replaced by a XV-770-6, with a repositioned oil cooler, during flight testing; despite this, the problems continued.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{promising}} projects in the application of combined heat and power(CHP) lies in energy production for buildings. Stirling <b>engines</b> <b>are</b> very applicable to residential buildings, especially because of the higher electricity/heat efficiency. A literature review on stirling <b>engines</b> <b>is</b> first provided and a number of research works on the development and applications of Stirling <b>engines</b> <b>are</b> discussed. Then according to buildings' energy consumption, relevant output of power density of Stirling <b>engines</b> <b>is</b> estimated. From the results, the design parameters of Stirling <b>engines</b> <b>are</b> derived and the temperature difference on frequency and performance of Stirling <b>engines</b> <b>is</b> also discussed...|$|R

50|$|Retirement from {{passenger}} service {{started with}} the fissioning of Norwegian State Railways. 8 <b>engines</b> <b>were</b> transferred to the CargoNet freight company. In 2002, a further six <b>engines</b> <b>were</b> sold to the Swedish operator Tågkompaniet and the remaining three <b>engines</b> <b>were</b> purchased by CargoNet. In 2007 all <b>engines</b> from Tågkompaniet <b>were</b> sold back to Norway. Two 16 <b>engines</b> <b>were</b> lost when burnt up by fire during cargo services across the Swedish border.|$|R
5|$|The <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> {{moved forward}} 100mm (4in) to improve {{longitudinal}} stability.|$|E

5|$|Britain {{considered}} {{the selection of}} Rolls-Royce to develop the advanced engine for the MRCA to be essential, and was strongly opposed to adopting an engine from an American manufacturer, {{to the point where}} the UK might have withdrawn over the issue. In September 1969, Rolls-Royce's RB 199 <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> selected to power the MRCA. One advantage over the US competition was that a technology transfer between the partner nations had been agreed; the <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> to be developed and manufactured by a joint company, Turbo-Union. The programme was delayed by Rolls-Royce's entry into receivership in 1971; the nature of the multinational collaboration process helped avoid major disruption of the Tornado programme. Research from the supersonic airliner Concorde contributed to the development and final design of the RB.199 and of the engine control units.|$|E
50|$|For most uses, the {{cylinders}} of the <b>engine</b> <b>were</b> double-acting. Opposing {{sides of the}} high- and low-pressure cylinders were cross-connected to each other. Where <b>engines</b> <b>were</b> used for pumping, Woolf <b>engines</b> <b>were</b> also built with paired single-acting cylinders.|$|R

5|$|On 4 February 1908, a light <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> in a sidelong {{collision}} with a passenger train {{due to a}} signalman's error. Seven passengers were injured.|$|E
5|$|One {{aircraft}} was fitted with the Shvetsov M-71 for trials in 1944. However the <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> {{not yet ready}} for service and the program was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|Restricted driver {{visibility}} {{due to the}} air-smoothed casing. The exhaust {{problem was}} never adequately resolved, and continued to beat down onto the air-smoothed casing when the <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> on the move, obscuring the driver's vision from the cab.|$|E
50|$|The {{railway used}} to be of general {{economic}} significance for many decades. Initially steam <b>engines</b> <b>were</b> obtained from the Baldwin Locomotive Works. The last set of 2-8-0 steam <b>engines</b> <b>were</b> obtained in 1953. In 1957 the first Alstom diesel-electric <b>engines</b> <b>were</b> delivered, later <b>engines</b> <b>were</b> delivered in 1968, and again in 1992. The last delivery consisted of Alstoms AD24 BBB with the numbers 2401-9.Few steam and diesel <b>engines</b> <b>are</b> in an operational mode and numbers of availability conflict.

5|$|Simons Wrecking Company No. 2 is a H.K. Porter, 0-6-0T {{steam engine}} built in 1941. The tank engine, which is oil fired, {{worked for the}} US Navy during World War II in Virginia as #14. Later the <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> put into service with Simons Wrecking Co. as No. 2.|$|E
5|$|The RA615H <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> {{developed}} at Honda's Automobile Research and Development facilities in Utsunomiya in Tochigi Prefecture—the same facility {{used to develop}} the Honda Civic WTCC {{for use in the}} World Touring Car Championship and the Honda NSX-GT to compete in the Japanese Super GT championship—with the project led by Yasuhisa Arai.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} directed by Tetsuya Nomura, who also created the story concept and main character designs. Nomura {{wanted to create}} a darker Final Fantasy title unsuitable for the main series. The initial development went slowly, and by 2007 the scale of the project generated discussions about rebranding the game as the next main entry in the series. Production on Versus XIII ended in 2012, when it was rebranded as Final Fantasy XV and transferred over to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The PlayStation 3 version, which was originally built using the company's proprietary Crystal Tools game <b>engine,</b> <b>was</b> abandoned due to concerns about the platform's shortening life cycle. Its <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> changed to Luminous Studio, Square Enix's custom-built engine for eighth-generation gaming hardware.|$|E
5000|$|Crate <b>engines</b> <b>are</b> {{well suited}} in many {{different}} vehicle platforms. <b>Engines</b> <b>are</b> often used in the following applications: ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> {{the same}} 90° 4.3 litre V8 {{as in the}} {{standard}} F430. The output remains the same at , {{as well as the}} torque at 343 lbft Nm. The <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> equipped with Double Overhead Camshafts and contains 4 valves per cylinder. The <b>engine</b> <b>is,</b> and always has been, naturally aspirated. The <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> mounted behind the cockpit, and faces longitudinally (along the length of the car).|$|R
50|$|Note: diesel <b>engines</b> <b>are</b> not {{available}} in North America. Starting from late 2004 diesel <b>engines</b> <b>are</b> Fiat-sourced common rail units.|$|R
5|$|This new 'dreamworld' <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> {{successfully}} {{released to}} the public for use on the live servers on June 25, 2015. While the engine is still in a 'beta' state, it is available for use with the 'live' production servers.|$|E
5|$|VAT {{could offer}} only petrol engines until 1953. The most common ones were the Hercules engines made {{domestically}} under licence by SAT and Tampella. The SAT-made <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> called the Sisu AMG or SA5, {{and the engine}} made by Tampella was the Tampella 6000. The second most common <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> the Cadillac V8 1G and the third was the White 160 AX, which Kytölä had bought from Central Europe. Some Bedford petrol engines were used in Defence Forces lorries in the 1960s and Ford V8 engines were used for fire engines. The first diesel Vanajas were powered by Saurer and Kämper engines. The vast majority of diesel engines were supplied by Leyland and AEC. A few Vanajas were equipped with the Perkins R6 or the Ford Trader 510E. In some cases, the <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> provided by the customer; one Vanaja was powered by a Mercedes-Benz diesel engine.|$|E
5|$|After version 1.0 {{had been}} finished, the engine's code name White <b>Engine</b> <b>was</b> changed to the {{official}} title Crystal Tools. This was not only done to represent {{the company and its}} works better, but also due to the refractive effects of real-life crystals that were meant to symbolize the flexibility of the engine. Over the next few months, the programmers advanced the engine to version 1.1 and added preliminary support for the Wii. In September 2011, Final Fantasy Versus XIII director Tetsuya Nomura announced that his team had replaced Crystal Tools with a proprietary action game engine that was supplemented by the lighting technology of the company's new Luminous Studio engine. Other teams, such as the staff behind Final Fantasy XIII-2, kept using and refining Crystal Tools. For , the <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> adjusted to make it more suitable to games with an open world design.|$|E
5000|$|Power: The <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> a {{controlled}} 5.0L V8 (R302ci for the Ford Falcon and 304ci for the Holden Commodore). Most {{parts of the}} <b>engine</b> <b>are</b> controlled and unlike the Australian Touring Cars (Supercars Championship) which uses fuel injection, the series uses {{a controlled}} carburettor. The other control parts for the <b>engine</b> <b>are</b> manifolds, exhausts, cam-shafts, rockers, air-filter/cold air box and ignition. The <b>engines</b> <b>are</b> rev-limited to 6400rpm. Top speed is 240 km/h.|$|R
50|$|As of the 2008 season, the {{railroad}} operates three coal-fired narrow-gauge steam locomotives. <b>Engine</b> #1 <b>is</b> an 0-4-4-0 Orenstein & Koppel articulated mallet built in 1902. <b>Engine</b> #2 <b>is</b> a 0-4-0 Henschel built in 1936. <b>Engine</b> #3 <b>is</b> an 0-4-0 H. K. Porter tank built in 1927. <b>Engine</b> #4 <b>is</b> a W. G. Bagnall 0-4-4-0T, built in 1947. The 5th <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> a 1951 General Electric, four wheel, diesel-electric <b>engine</b> that <b>was</b> battery operated for underground mining at the Idarado Mine near Telluride, Colorado. The <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> currently {{being used by}} {{the railroad}}'s track crew.|$|R
50|$|Petrol <b>engines</b> <b>are</b> Family 0 (1.0-1.4) and Family 1 (1.6), {{and diesel}} <b>engines</b> <b>are</b> {{derivative}} from MultiJet (1.3) and Circle L (1.7).|$|R
5|$|Around 1954, NATC {{modified}} the sole surviving XAJ-1 to conduct inflight refueling tests using the probe and drogue configuration. The turbojet <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> removed and the fuel hose and its drogue extended {{out from the}} jet's former exhaust opening. Aircraft in service retained the turbojet and had their bomb bay doors modified to accommodate the hose and drogue. They were refueling aircraft during late 1954.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1950s and in {{the early}} 1960s, VAT and the French Camions Willème SA had plans for joint production, but only one jointly {{produced}} prototype was ever made; the chassis was from Vanaja, the <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> from AEC, and the cabin, which was a forward control type cabin and partly made from glass fibre, was from Willème.|$|E
5|$|Bovington Tank Museum, Dorset, UK. Tiger II {{with early}} {{production}} turret is on display. This vehicle {{was the second}} soft steel prototype made and did not see active service.
