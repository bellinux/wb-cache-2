Research is, therefore, required to elucidate {{the patterns of}} biodiversity that exist and {{the factors that influence}} them, particularly under changing climates. Landscape processes affect environmental heterogeneity, which in turn affect patterns of biodiversity. Two inland Antarctic nunataks, Robertskollen and the Northern Buttress of Vesleskarvet, were selected for investigation to determine the potential impact of selected environmental factors on lichen distribution and abundance, at the intra- and inter-nunatak scales. Lichens were found to prefer rock faces with dips between 1 ° and 45 °, and northern/southern aspects.

During three expeditions, 2009 - 2011, we examined three sites on the South Shetland Islands in Antarctica. Two of them displayed intensive sulfide mineralization and generated acidic (pH 3. 2 - 4. 5), iron-rich drainage waters (up to 1. 78 mM Fe), which infiltrated as groundwater (as Fe 2 +) and as superficial runoff (as Fe 3 +) into the sea, the latter with the formation of schwertmannite in the sea-ice. The formation of ARD in the Antarctic was catalyzed by acid mine drainage microorganisms found in cold climates, including Acidithiobacillus ferrivorans and Thiobacillus plumbophilus. The dissolved iron (DFe) flux <b>from</b> <b>rock</b> <b>weathering</b> (nonmineralized control site) was calculated to be 0. 45 × 109 g DFe yr- 1 for the nowadays 5468 km of ice-free Antarctic rock coastline which is of the same order of magnitude as glacial or aeolian input to the Southern Ocean. Additionally, the two ARD sites alone liberate 0. 026 and 0. 057 × 109 g DFe yr- 1 as point sources to the sea.

The median of the total dissolved solid concentration of the Songhua River was 104. 8 mg/L, about two times higher than the global average (65. 0 mg/L), but lower than that of other Chinese Rivers. Prevalent ions were Na+, Ca 2 + and HCO 3 (-), and the average Ca 2 +/Na+ and Mg 2 +/Na+ molar ratios were 0. 70 and 0. 42, which were close to silicate weathering end-member. Long-term trend analysis by seasonal MK test showed that from 1962 to 1984, Ca 2 +, Na+ + K+ and HCO 3 (-) were significantly increasing, and the increasing rates calculated by linear fit slopes for Ca 2 +, Na+ + K+ and HCO 3 (-) ions were 0. 22, 0. 63 and 2. 35 mg/year, respectively.

The SO 42 ¯/Cl¯ ratio reveal that more than 87 % of sulphate (frequently > 95 %) of total sulphate carried by the subglacial runoff and proglacial streams was derived from non-snowpack sources. The proximity of non-snowpack sulphate δ 34 S (∼ 8 – 19 ‰) to the δ 34 S of the major rocks in the vicinity (∼− 6 to + 18 ‰) suggest that the non-snowpack sulphate was principally derived <b>from</b> <b>rock</b> <b>weathering.</b> Furthermore, Ca 2 ++Mg 2 +/SO 42 ˉ molar shows that sulphate acquisition in the meltwaters was controlled by two major processes: 1) coupled-sulphide carbonate weathering (molar ratio ∼ 2) and, 2) re-dissolution of secondary salts (molar ratio ∼ 1). The δ 34 S–SO 4 = + 19. 4 ‰ > δ 34 S–S of rock, accompanied by increased sulphate concentration also indicates an input from re-dissolution of secondary salts. Overall, δ 18 O composition of these non-snowpack sulphate (− 11. 9 to − 2. 2 ‰) mostly stayed below the threshold δ 18 O value (− 6. 7 to − 3. 3 ‰) for minimum O 2 condition, suggesting that certain proportion of sulphate was regularly supplied from anaerobic sulphide oxidation. 高緯度北極域のSO 42 −の発生・消滅源やそれに関連する生物地球化学的プロセスを理解するために、冬季の積雪、夏の融解水、および岩石サンプルを採取し、主要イオン濃度および安定同位体比（δ 18 O, δ 34 S）を分析した。SO 42 −/Cl−比から、氷河底排水と氷河前縁の水路によって輸送される全SO 42 −のうち、 87 %以上が積雪以外の起源であることがわかった。積雪外起源のSO 42 −のδ 34 Sと周辺の岩石のδ 34 Sの値が近いことから、積雪外起源のSO 42 −は主に岩石の風化によってもたらされたと考えられる。さらに、Ca 2 + + Mg 2 +/SO 42 −比から融解水中のSO 42 −濃度は主に、硫化物と炭酸塩の風化および、二次塩の再溶解の２つのプロセスによって制御されていると考えられる。SO 42 −濃度の増加をもたらす岩石中のδ 34 S−SO 4 = + 19. 4 ‰はδ 34 S−Sよりも高く、これもまたSO 42 −が二次塩の再溶解によって供給されたことを示している。積雪外起源のSO 42 −のδ 18 Oのほとんどは、O 2 の下限状態の閾値よりも低い。これは、ある一定量のSO 42 −は定期的に嫌気的な硫化物の酸化によって供給されていることを示している...|$|R

This is markedly lower than those obtained in amphibolite (0.45  mhos), which means that the aquifer vulnerability in gneisses is relatively higher compared to those in amphibolite terrain. Accordingly, the potential for water infiltration through the regolith, inferred from the total longitudinal conductance, is better in gneiss terrains than in amphibolite. Notwithstanding, bedrock resistivities of only five out of nineteen (19) locations were fractured (Table  5, Fig.  12). However, the percentage of occurrences of partially weathered basement was 48 % and quite enormous (Fig.  12), and with this, the degree of rock decomposition can also be said to be equally high. Bedrock fractures occurred at the depth of 16.6 – 27.3  m (av. 22.5  m). This is comparatively deeper than other bedrocks (Table  5).

Small organisms feeding on the nutrients created large areas without oxygen, which caused a mass extinction of marine species, while the levels of CO2 dropped all over the world, allowing the formation of ice caps on the poles.|$|R
40|$|The Central Clay Plain is {{situated}} between latitudes 16 ° and 10 ° North and longitudes 32 ° and 37 ° East, in the Republic of the Sudan. The parent materials of the clay soils which cover almost this entire area belong to two broad groups: alluvial, deltaic and paludal sediments from rivers {{belonging to the}} Nile system (aggradational clay plains), and colluvio-alluvial deposits derived <b>from</b> local <b>rock</b> <b>weathering,</b> pediplanation and short-distance transport (degradational clay plains). The soils are classified as Vertisols in three international systems. Relationships between soil parent material, landform, climate, vegetation and soils were defined in the field. Field studies were supported by an analysis of mineralogical, chemical and physical soil data. The various landscapes that together make the Central Clay Plain were delineated on a 1 : 2 000 000 pedogeomorphic map. Hypotheses on the sedimentation history of the aggradational plains were tested against data on geology, palaeoclimatology and palaeobotany in the literature. Soils, vegetation and landforms show the degradational plains to be pediplains in an advanced stage of planation. Special attention is given to soil classification, soil genesis, the process of pedoturbation, and the origin and impact of relatively small differences in soil morphology. It {{was found that the}} climatic north-south gradient has a stronger influence on soil properties than differences in parent material between aggradational and degradational plains...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates slope {{stability}} of soil nailed walls which {{are located on}} sites formed with mostly residual soils. Residual soils, forming <b>from</b> <b>weathered</b> <b>rocks</b> {{can be found in}} many parts of the world with different characteristics and appearance based on type of the parent rock they have been formed of. A review on geotechnical properties of residual soils that have been used in previous studies in different parts of the world will be presented and then evaluated to be used as parameters for numerical analysis of soil nailed walls. Slope stability assessment is performed by LEM analysis and a discussion on the results of analysis is presented in this paper. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EngineeringFull Tex...|$|R

40|$|Sudden {{geometric}} {{increase in}} population of Ado-Ekiti has {{lead to an}} increase in demand for water and harnessing of subsurface water reserve. This research investigated the possible infiltration of dissolved mineral <b>from</b> <b>weathered</b> <b>rock</b> into subsurface water in the area (basement complex rocks), and comparing the mineral level with the set standard for quality water by the World Health Organization Physical test were carried out on hardness, colour, odour, conductivity, pH, and turbidity. Chemical test for sodium (Na+) and potassium (K 2 +) was also done using experimental scientific set standard. The analysis of the sodium, potassium ions, and the conductivity of the water indicate that dissolved mineral <b>from</b> <b>rocks</b> have great influence on the underground water property. The level of the dissolved mineral is within the acceptable limit for water quality standard set by the W. H. O. Sourcing for underground water should not be based on hydro geological variable alone but possible chemical interference from the geology of the environment (rock type) ...|$|R
