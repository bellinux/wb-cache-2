30|$|The {{literature}} cited so far primarily emphasizes entrepreneurial {{networks and}} network resources in general {{but does not}} consider that numerous entrepreneurs are incubated and may hence also profit from incubator-provided network resources. Consequently, it is critical for scholarly research to study both networks {{that are related to}} start-ups’ incubation and “private” external networks that extend beyond the incubator. In the following review, we therefore pay particular attention to studies related to <b>incubation</b> and incubator <b>network</b> resources.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a new approach}} to describe the spread of research topics across disciplines using epidemic models. The approach is based on applying individual-based models from mathematical epidemiology to the diffusion of a research topic over a contact network that represents knowledge flows over the map of science -as obtained from citations between ISI Subject Categories. Using research publications on the protein class kinesin as a case study, we report a better fit between model and empirical data when using the citation-based contact <b>network.</b> <b>Incubation</b> periods on the order of 4 to 15. 5 years support the view that, whilst research topics may grow very quickly, they face difficulties to overcome disciplinary boundaries.

30|$|Taken together, the {{reviewed}} studies generally {{indicate that}} a crucial mission of business incubators is to enable the tenants to leverage network resources internally and with external agents. However, {{a number of the}} studies have reported that these activities have proven challenging. Inter-tenant networking is limited and business incubators’ mission to foster external network resources is also limited and not particularly adapted “to serve effectively each individual tenant” (Tötterman and Sten 2005, p. 503). It thus appears that network resources shaped through <b>network</b> <b>incubation</b> also tend to be generic in nature. In addition, {{it is interesting to note}} that incubation studies are practically silent on comparing the value and characteristics of the path-dependent trajectory of the tenants’ “private” networks established prior to incubation and in parallel with incubation. Sá and Lee (2012, p. 248) addressed this issue when referring to incubator start-ups, claiming that “most of their strategic relations were established before locating at MaRS [the incubator] or through their own effort,” but we lack systematic knowledge of how incubator tenants may combine incubator network resources with “private” external network resources.|$|R
30|$|The {{incubator}} firms mainly {{relied on}} “private” external networks beyond the incubator to acquire critical resources. These were identity-based and path-dependent networks established prior to incubation or more recent calculative networks {{that they had}} actively sought. Hence, the incubator firms took responsibility for acquiring networks and did not rely solely on the incubator for critical network resources. This implies that the incubator management, and the internal networks between incubator firms and the incubator’s extended network, to a modest extent provided the firms with critical (idiosyncratic) external network resources but instead provided the start-ups with strategic and advisory network resources that are more generic in nature. Hence, the research findings show that practically all tenants had abundant external “private” network resources that {{can be described as}} idiosyncratic (non-generic) in nature. All of the tenants had their own story to tell about the development of these network resources, both before and after <b>incubation.</b> These external <b>network</b> resources were most critical for start-ups in all phases of the enterprise development through their provision of R&D knowledge, access to monetary funding, and market access.|$|R
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide {{insights}} on the relational dimension of a networked business incubator (NBI), by investigating the intermediary role of incubator management in fostering social and business ties linking tenants among each other, with the incubator management and external actors. Design/methodology/approach - The paper offers a literature review on the NBIs and advances a comprehensive analytical framework of the <b>networked</b> <b>incubation</b> model. This framework is empirically illustrated through a case study research on a leading Italian private NBI, namely, H-Farm. The collection of primary data was conducted by means of face-to-face in-depth interviews and a survey. Data were processed through social network analysis (SNA) tools. Findings - The results highlight the co-presence and interaction of social and business ties, which build up a vital environment nurturing an entrepreneurial ecosystem. Community-based relationships and the intermediation of incubator management are crucial for supporting tenants in product and business development activities. Research limitations/implications - These results pave the way to further research, oriented to the conceptualization of a NBI as a (small) cluster. Moreover, the application of the SNA tools adopted invites further research on networked incubators, applying the same methodology in new directions. Originality/value - This paper adds to previous literature on NBIs by providing evidence of the intermediary role of incubator management in promoting and facilitating social and business relationships occurring among tenants, between tenants and the incubator management, as well as with external advisors, clients and suppliers...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCyanobacteria are {{widespread}} photosynthetic microorganisms {{among which}} some {{are able to}} fix atmospheric nitrogen. We investigated the impact of indigenous cyanobacteria strains (Nostoc) inoculation on physical characteristics of poorly aggregated soils from Guquka (Eastern Cape, South Africa). The soil aggregates (3 – 5 mm) were arranged into a layer of 10 – 20 mm thick, and sprayed with cyanobacteria solution. Subsequently the inoculated and un-inoculated samples were incubated (30 C, 80 % humidity, continuous illumination at 100 lmol m– 2 s– 1). Their micromorphological characteristics and aggregate stability were investigated, after 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 weeks of incubation, by using high resolution Cryo-SEM and aggregate breakdown tests. Micromorphological investigations revealed that the surface of uninoculated samples remained uncovered, while the inoculated samples were partially covered by cyanobacteria material after one week of <b>incubation.</b> Adense superficial <b>network</b> of cyanobacterial filaments and extracellular polymer secretions (EPS) covered their surface after 4 and 6 weeks of incubation. Organo-mineral aggregates comprising cyanobacterial filaments and EPS were observed after 6 weeks of incubation. The results of aggregate breakdown tests showed {{no significant difference between}} un-inoculated samples after 1, 2, 3, 4 or 6 weeks, while they revealed improvement of aggregate stability for inoculated samples. The improvement of aggregate stability appeared in a short while following inoculation and increased gradually with time and cyanobacteria growth. The increase in aggregate stability is likely related to the changes induced in micromorphological characteristics by cyanobacterial filaments and EPS. It reflects the effect of coating, enmeshment, binding and gluing of aggregates and isolated mineral particles by cyanobacteria material...|$|R
