5000|$|Because {{a single}} {{abnormal}} TSH level can be misleading, T3 and T4 levels must {{be measured in}} the blood to further confirm the diagnosis. When circulating in the body, T3 and T4 are bound to transport proteins. Only {{a small fraction of}} the circulating thyroid hormones are unbound or free, and thus biologically active. T3 and T4 levels can thus be measured as free T3 and T4, or total T3 and T4, which takes into consideration the <b>free</b> <b>hormones</b> in addition to the protein-bound <b>hormones.</b> <b>Free</b> T3 and T4 measurements are important because certain drugs and illnesses can affect the concentrations of transport proteins, resulting in differing total and <b>free</b> thyroid <b>hormone</b> levels.

One of the major constraints of getting plant regeneration from the explants of C. olitorius was the production of healthy seedlings in vitro. An efficient seed germination system and healthy seedling production have been established at BJRI. Seeds of different varieties (O 4, O 9897, OM 1 and O 72) of C. olitorius germinated on both agar supported <b>hormone</b> <b>free</b> MS medium and cotton supported <b>hormone</b> <b>free</b> liquid MS medium.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{describes}} {{the presence of}} 33 pharmaceuticals and hormones in waters from two sewage treatment plants (STPs) situated in Catalonia, in northeastern Spain. The target compounds were one psychoactive stimulant, one antiepileptic, four analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, one lipid regula-tors, two anti-ulcer agents, nine antibiotics (sulfonamides andmacrolides), two beta-blockers, twometabolites, and 11 <b>hormones</b> (<b>free</b> and conjugates). The determination was performed using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry after enrichment by solid-phase extraction with Oasis HLB sorbent.
