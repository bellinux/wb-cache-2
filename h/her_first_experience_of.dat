500|$|On 9 October Fram had <b>her</b> <b>first</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> ice pressure. Archer's {{design was}} quickly vindicated {{as the ship}} rose and fell, the ice being unable to grip the hull.

He arranged for his daughter's first job, at the influential Biba boutique, when she was 15. The next year, she left North London Collegiate and began a training program at Harrods. At her parents' behest, she also took fashion classes at a nearby school. Soon she gave them up, saying, [...] "You either know fashion or you don't."

And it took me years to learn enough to live up to what they said for those first notices. I find it so stupid. I remember the critic very well and have never forgiven him." ...|$|E
500|$|The BBC purposefully {{searched for}} an actress with Asperger {{syndrome}} {{to play the}} part of Poppy. Lizzy Clark auditioned for the part after her mother saw an advert on an autism website. Clark was selected to play Poppy, and the role in Dustbin Baby was <b>her</b> <b>first</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> professional acting. Clark was the first actress with Asperger syndrome to portray a fictional character with the condition. Clark, who has since campaigned with her mother against characters with conditions such as Asperger syndrome being played by actors without the condition, said [...] "My Asperger's made some things on the film set difficult at first, like dealing with the sudden noise of the storyboard, but I was soon so focused on acting that I didn't notice anything else." ...|$|E

60|$|Then Helen {{flashed a}} look at Bo, which look gave her a delicious, almost irresistible desire to laugh.

Bo turned white then red as a rose.|$|E
60|$|Then she {{sat down}} to watch her mother die, and to think. Could there be any good God, she wondered, if He allowed such things to happen.

60|$|They {{made the}} rounds of the hospitals, which were already crowded with wounded, and Gys stopped at one long enough to assist the French doctor in a {{delicate}} operation.

60|$|I knew, too, {{that her}} concern at my state was the greater {{because it was}} not <b>her</b> <b>first</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> a trouble of this kind. My elder long- absent brother had {{scarcely}} ceased to be a boy before throwing off all belief in the Christian creed and congratulating himself on having got rid of old wives' fables, as he scornfully expressed it. But never a word did he say to her of this change, and without a word she knew it, and when she spoke to us on the subject nearest to her heart and he listened in respectful silence, she knew the thought and feeling--that was in him-that he loved her above everybody but was free of her creed.|$|E
6000|$|She {{wanted to}} look at him, but could not. A queer sort of exultation had seized on her. This man had power; yet she had power over him. If she wished she could make him her slave, her dog, chain him to her. She had but to hold out her hand, and he would go on his knees to kiss it. She had but to say, [...] "Come," [...] and he would come from {{wherever}} he might be. She had but to say, [...] "Be good," [...] and he would be good. It was <b>her</b> <b>first</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> power; and it was intoxicating. But--but!

60|$|She {{proceeded}} with her story. The great influence {{of her family}} connections had shielded her {{from some of the}} consequences of her imputed guilt. But, in her despair, she had fled from home, and had surrounded her flight with such circumstances as rendered it the most probable conclusion that she had committed suicide. Miriam, however, was not of the feeble nature which takes advantage of that obvious and poor resource in earthly difficulties. She flung herself upon the world, and speedily created a new sphere, in which Hilda's gentle purity, the sculptor's sensibility, clear thought, and genius, and Donatello's genial simplicity had given her almost <b>her</b> <b>first</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> happiness. Then came that ill-omened adventure of the catacomb, The spectral figure which she encountered there was the evil fate that had haunted her through life.|$|E
60|$|For a {{long time}} Tess did not join in the weekly pilgrimages. But under {{pressure}} from matrons {{not much older than}} herself--for a field-man's wages being as high at twenty-one as at forty, marriage was early here--Tess at length consented to go. <b>Her</b> <b>first</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> the journey afforded her more enjoyment than she had expected, the hilariousness of the others being quite contagious after her monotonous attention to the poultry-farm all the week. She went again and again. Being graceful and interesting, standing moreover on the momentary threshold of womanhood, her appearance drew down upon her some sly regards from loungers in the streets of Chaseborough; hence, though sometimes her journey to the town was made independently, she always searched for her fellows at nightfall, to have the protection of their companionship homeward.|$|E
60|$|In {{spite of}} {{suffering}} because love {{was not the}} first emotion in his heart, the girl could only feel he was right not to be loving her; that she ought to be glad of what was eating up all else within him. It was ungenerous, unworthy, to want to be loved at such a moment. Yet she could not help it! This was <b>her</b> <b>first</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> the eternal tug between self and the loved one pulled in the hearts of lovers. Would she ever come to feel happy when he was just doing what he thought was right? And she drew a little away from him; then perceived that unwittingly she had done the right thing, for he at once tried to take her hand again. And this was her first lesson, too, in the nature of man. If she did not give her hand, he wanted it! But she was not one of those who calculate in love; so she gave him her hand at once. That went to his heart; and he put his arm round her, till he could feel the emotion under those stays that would not be drawn any closer. In this nest beneath the ash-tree they sat till they heard the organ wheeze and the furious sound of the last hymn, and saw the brisk coming-forth with its air of, 'Thank God! And now, to eat!' till at last there was no stir again about the little church--no stir at all save that of nature's ceaseless thanksgiving....|$|E

Her rehabilitation was then moved to the Royal North Shore Hospital, where she met Christie Dawes (née Skelton), who she would later race with in the Australian 4x100m relay team at the 2008 Beijing Paralympics.
