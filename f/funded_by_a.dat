5|$|Ernest {{decided that}} the train {{journeys}} and frozen limbs were too much for his son, so he sent Bill to St Patrick's College, Goulburn as a boarder in 1921, where he quickly showed his athletic flair by becoming {{a member of the}} school's rugby league, tennis, athletics and cricket teams.

It will be <b>funded</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> temporary increase in the Sovereign Grant paid from the income of the Crown Estate and is intended to extend the building's working life by at least 50 years. In March 2017, the House of Commons backed funding for the project by 464 votes to 56.|$|E

5|$|Since 1996, {{the upper}} Caroline Street {{corridor}} and Key West Bight {{have been part}} of ongoing improvement efforts spearheaded by the City of Key West and <b>funded</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> special property tax system.

The dynamics of the project changed throughout its course; in early 2011, the city approved spending for specific updates to infrastructure along the corridor, including improved lighting and signs, a more extensive sidewalk system, and versatility with regard to bicycle and pedestrian traffic. As recently as February 2012, additional requests for improvements were lodged with $720,000 available for the project.|$|E
