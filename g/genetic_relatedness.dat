5|$|P.exclamans are haplodiploid insects, as {{are other}} Polistes species {{including}} Polistes metricus, Polistes dominula, and Polistes annularis. This means they have haploid males that produce identical haploid sperm, and diploid females that produce haploid eggs through meiosis. This has consequences for <b>genetic</b> <b>relatedness</b> within colonies, since sisters receive identical sperm if {{they share a}} father, and the normal half identical contribution from the mother. This results in sex-biased conflicts between the queen and the workers {{with respect to the}} sex ratio, with workers preferring a more female biased sex ratio, and queens preferring equal investment in queens and males.|$|E
25|$|Because swarm-founding colonies {{can contain}} {{more than one}} {{egg-laying}} queen, they tend to challenge the kin selection theory and typically do not meet Hamilton’s rule of haplodiploid species mentioned in the introduction. In comparison to other swarm-founding species, these theories are challenged further in R. romandi. R. romandi colonies are extremely large, and can have an average of up to 400 queens at any one time. The average for other swarm-founding species is only around 20 queens. Having such {{a large number of}} queens decreases the <b>genetic</b> <b>relatedness</b> within the nest. Workers in R. romandi have a <b>genetic</b> <b>relatedness</b> of only 0.16, and queens have a <b>genetic</b> <b>relatedness</b> of only 0.34. The next lowest <b>genetic</b> <b>relatedness</b> among a swarm founding species is found in Polybia emaciata 's 0.24 among workers and 0.55 among queens. These numbers indicate a large deviation from Hamilton’s ¾ rule. Independent-founding species, with fewer queens, {{are much more likely to}} be more genetically related.|$|E

25|$|Kin {{discrimination}} also influences cooperation {{because the}} actor can give aid preferentially towards related partners.

40|$|The {{aquaculture}} {{industry has}} increasingly {{aimed at improving}} economically important traits like growth, feed efficiency and resistance to infections. Artificial selection represents an important window of opportunity to significantly improve production. However, the pitfall is that selection will reduce genetic diversity and increase inbreeding in the farmed stocks. Genetic tools are very useful in this context as they provide accurate measures of genetic diversity together with many additional insights in the stock status and the selection process. In this study we assessed the level of <b>genetic</b> variability and <b>relatedness</b> over several generations of two lines of experimentally selected European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.). The first line was selected for growth over three generations and the second line for both high and low weight loss under a starvation regime over two generations. We used a genomic approach (2549 single nucleotide polymorphism markers derived from double digest restriction site associated DNA sequencing) in combination with eight microsatellites to estimate <b>genetic</b> variation, <b>relatedness,</b> effective population size and genetic differentiation across generations. Individual heterozygosity estimates indicated that the selected lines showed no significant reduction in diversity compared with wild populations. There was, however, a decreasing trend in allelic richness, suggesting the loss of low frequency alleles. We compared the estimates of effective population size from genetic markers with pedigree information and found good correspondence between methods. This study provides important insights in the genetic consequences of selective breeding and demonstrates the operational use of the latest genomic tools to estimate variability, inbreeding and at a later stage domestication and artificial selection...|$|R
25|$|Some {{research}} suggests that individuals provide more help to closer relatives. This phenomenon is known as kin discrimination. In their meta-analysis, researchers compiled data on kin selection as mediated by <b>genetic</b> <b>relatedness</b> in 18 species, including the western bluebird, pied kingfisher, Australian magpie, and dwarf mongoose. They found that different species exhibited varying degrees of kin discrimination, with the largest frequencies occurring {{among those who have}} the most to gain from cooperative interactions.|$|E

To maintain a clear distinction between attested and reconstructed forms, comparative linguists prefix an asterisk to any form that is not found in surviving texts.

25|$|Unlike {{associate}} females or co-foundresses, helpers typically share <b>genetic</b> <b>relatedness</b> {{with the}} foundress. Female helpers indirectly obtain benefits in fitness because the reproductive {{duration of the}} foundress is relatively short. Thus, the line {{to become the next}} dominant is not long. Many female helpers possess fully developed ovaries and the ability to produce male and female offspring. This anatomical feature of helpers may be indicative of a selective trait for preparedness for when the current dominant female stops reproducing. Most females will become egg-layers whether on a new nest or their natal nest.|$|E
40|$|Population {{bottlenecks}} {{are assumed}} to {{play a key role}} in the maintenance of social traits in microbes. Ecological parameters such as colonisation or disturbances can favour cooperation through causing population bottlenecks that enhance <b>genetic</b> structuring (<b>relatedness).</b> However, the size of the population bottleneck is likely to play a crucial role in determining the success of cooperation. Relatedness is likely to increase with decreasing bottleneck size thus favouring the evolution of cooperation. I used an experimental evolution approach to test this prediction with biofilm formation by the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens as the cooperative trait. Replicate populations were exposed to disturbance events every four days under one of six population bottleneck treatments (from 10 (3) to 10 (8) bacterial cells). In line with predictions, the frequency of evolved cheats within the populations increased with increasing bottleneck size. This result highlights the importance of ecologically mediated population bottlenecks in the maintenance of social traits in microbes...|$|R
40|$|Background The malaria vector Anopheles arabiensis {{exhibits}} greater behavioural {{and ecological}} plasticity {{than the other}} major vectors of the Anopheles gambiae complex, which presents challenges for major control methods. This study reports {{for the first time}} the presence of An. arabiensis in Antula, a suburb of Bissau city, the capital of Guinea Bissau, where high levels of hybridization between Anopheles coluzzii and An. gambiae have been reported. Given that previous surveys in the area, based on indoor collections, did not sample An. arabiensis, the possibility of a recently introduced exophilic population was investigated. Methods Larval and adult mosquito collections were carried out in Antula at the end of the rainy season of 2010. Anopheles gambiae species composition, determined by rDNA-IGS and SINE 200 X 6. 1 markers, was compared with four previously collected samples dating back to 1993.

This pattern agrees with the distribution of mtDNA haplogroup X, which is found in North America, is absent from eastern Siberia, but {{is present in the}} Altais of southern central Siberia.

25|$|Ethnoarchaeological {{research}} shows that among use labor of subsistence based economies, as space between structures increases there is {{a decrease in the}} level of <b>genetic</b> <b>relatedness</b> and sharing between occupants of the structures.

25|$|This {{clash of}} {{perspectives}} led to {{something of a}} stand-off {{and a lack of}} communication between the disciplines, resulting in little cooperation and progress for three decades. The stand-off was resolved by Holland's Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship which re-visited biological inclusive fitness theory to draw a distinction between the statistical evolutionary mechanisms for the emergence of social traits and the non-deterministic proximate mechanisms through which they are expressed. In a strict interpretation of the theory, a statistical association of related genes (as would be present in the interactions of close genetic relatives) is understood as a necessary (though not sufficient) condition for the evolutionary emergence of certain traits relating to social cooperation (see kin selection). However, this does not entail that the proximate mechanisms governing the expression of such social traits in primates and humans necessarily depends on (or are determined by) conditions of <b>genetic</b> <b>relatedness</b> per se. For the vast majority of social mammals—including primates and humans—the formation of social bonds (and the resulting social cooperation) are based on familiarity from an early developmental stage, and the same kinds of mechanisms that attachment theorists (see above) have outlined. In short, in humans and in other primates, <b>genetic</b> <b>relatedness</b> is not necessary for the attachment bonds to develop, and it is the performance of nurture that underlies such bonds and the enduring social cooperation that typically accompanies them (see Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship).|$|E

It is an effective method of enhancing shooting programs in highly gregarious mammal species. We used social genetic data to examine {{the utility of the}} Judas technique in a novel species: wild dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius). Firstly, we used molecular data (13 microsatellite markers from 1, 050 camels) to characterize <b>genetic</b> diversity and <b>relatedness</b> within and between observed social groups. <b>Genetic</b> estimates of <b>relatedness</b> between pairs within a group (r = - 0. 058) were not different from a comparison between any 2 randomly selected individuals. We did not find relatedness within and between social groups to be significantly different for 78 % of social groups, suggesting a fission-fusion social structure conducive to applying the Judas technique. Secondly, we performed an operational trial of the Judas technique to assess the predictions of the genetic data. We tracked 10 collared Judas camels using a combination of satellite- and radio-telemetry for 9. 0 ± 5. 0 (mean ± SD) months between 2008 and 2010. We found Judas animals with a cohort of animals on 96 % of occasions. Cohorts displayed no significant size difference prior to shooting (9. 3 ± 9. 9 animals), and after shooting (9. 2 ± 7. 5 animals).
