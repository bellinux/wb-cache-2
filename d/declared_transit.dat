50|$|Metrolinx {{has been}} criticized for not having enough {{executive}} power in planning transit outside of municipal politics, despite being established to take political delay out of transportation planning. After Rob Ford was elected Mayor of Toronto in December 2010, he <b>declared</b> <b>Transit</b> City, the provincially funded transit expansion plan of light rail lines, dead. These lines were a large component of Metrolinx’s 2008 Big Move. Metrolinx was again criticized when, in January 2012, its CEO declared that it would bend to what Toronto City Council wanted regarding how the Eglinton-Scarborough Crosstown LRT line should be built. The issue centred on whether the more suburban stretches of the line, from Laird Dr. to Kennedy Station, should be built at street level to save costs of building it underground.|$|E

5000|$|In an epilogue, the Red Death is seen {{playing with}} his Tarot cards with the girl who had escaped the {{massacre}} of the remaining villagers. Other similarly cloaked figures then gather around him, each wearing a different colour: the White Death, the Yellow Death, the Golden Death, the Blue Death, the Violet Death and the Black Death. They discuss among themselves {{the numbers of people}} each of them had 'claimed' that night, each accepting of their endless terrible task. When asked of his work, the Red Death says to them, [...] "I called many...peasant and prince...the worthy and the dishonoured. Six only are left." [...] Among the surviving six are Francesca, Gino, Hop-Toad, Esmeralda, the little girl that the Red Death plays cards with and an old man from a nearby village. The Red Death <b>declares</b> [...] "Sic <b>transit</b> gloria mundi" [...] (Latin for [...] "Thus passes the glory of the world") and the cloaked figures file offscreen in a grim procession. Over the procession are Poe's words: [...] "And darkness and decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all".|$|R
