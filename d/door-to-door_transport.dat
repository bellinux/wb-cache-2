Toll's revised bid, some $5.8 billion instead of about $4 billion offered initially, was considered by Patrick to be the best deal it could get. The deal ended Patrick's plans for acquiring FCL (which was then taken over by Linfox) and was expected to mean the sell-off of Patrick's 50% stake in Pacific National to a third party (under the ACCC's ruling).

The original reason that led me into choice of this topic is my personal interest in international trade, ships and securities. The shipping documents enable smooth operation of the international transport and the international transport facilitates the international trade as such. At present, almost all goods at the market are being shipped via ocean during their way to the final customer. The entire movement of goods via ocean is being conducted under shipping documents and the significance of the shipping documents is therefore considerable.

40|$|Natural geotraffic flows {{act as one}} of {{the most}} {{important}} factors directly affecting redirections of the world transportation routes. In terms of <b>door-to-door</b> multimodal <b>transport</b> chain, several routes from Far East toward European destinations exist, with Northern European route acting as prevailing one. The proposed paper elaborates possibilities of redirection of the traffic flow by directing cargoes to an alternative route through the Adriatic Sea. The aim is to justify realisation of mentioned possibility in terms of land transportation segment analysis, i. e. by analysing cargo transportation from ports to final destinations in Central Europe, placed in natural gravitational hinterland of ports of Northern Adriatic Port Association (NAPA). Geo-traffic and logistics’ analyses of NAPA ports are presented in the paper. Container traffic and its trend as compared with Northern European ports are analysed. The development plans of inland connections are presented in function of justification of the traffic flow redirection. A model for the selection and evaluation of the optimal container transport route by using the multiple criteria analysis (MCA) has been introduced and developed. The model was applied for the selection of the representative service connecting Far East (origin) and the central Europe (destination) by detailed analysis of the land transportation segment.

30|$|Inter-port {{competition}} increasingly {{focuses on}} the hinterland legs of <b>door-to-door</b> <b>transport</b> chains through the integration of maritime and inland transport systems [1, 2]. Vermeiren [3], studying competition between the ports of Rotterdam and Antwerp, even claims that intermodal transport chains are the single key differentiators in these <b>door-to-door</b> <b>transport</b> chains. Nevertheless, most ports (have to) rely {{to a large extent}} on road transport for serving their hinterland, although intermodal transport connections can maintain and extend the hinterland of seaports [4]. In this research, intermodal transport is defined as the use of different transport modes in a single transport chain, using loading units such as standardized containers, with no handling of the goods when changing modes (based on [5]) and the focus is solely on hinterland chains. An extensive intermodal transport network gives logistics service providers the opportunity to offer shippers a wide range of transport possibilities [6]. Furthermore, these alternative transport modes can alleviate congestion problems in and around the port area. Different barriers however prevent a more extensive use of intermodal transport services (see e.g. [7 – 9]).|$|E

Taking the road transport firm perspective, this study aims to evaluate the extent to which shared planning between agents explains the firm’s performance {{in the context of the}} intermodal relationship, and explores the key antecedents for shared planning in this context. The research hypotheses were tested on a sample of 106 relationships between shipping companies and road transport firms. Our study contributes to the literature on intermodality and short sea shipping by providing evidence on how shared planning positively benefits the road transport firm performance. The results also demonstrate that two factors––namely, trust in the shipping company and the road transport firm’s involvement through adaptations to the partner––largely determine shared planning...|$|R

40|$|Drivers are {{positioned}} as {{the nucleus of}} driving helped by driving support systems of ITS. An automatic driving system in the future may release drivers partially from driving but will never release them completely. This is because automobiles are a <b>door-to-door</b> means of <b>transport,</b> {{and the concept of}} an automobile is a driver controlled vehicle system in essence. Therefore, it is desirable for driving support systems of automobiles to have a reasonable interface with a focus placed on personal characteristics of drivers. Today, various systems aimed at pre-crash safety of drivers and reduction in driving loads are being made fit for practical application. These systems have excellent mechanical functions but systems are not good enough to fit driving feelings. This is because the driver models of these systems are the same, though each driver has different driving characteristics. Nowadays, tailormade medical treatment is receiving much attention in the field of medical care. It is also desirable for driving support systems to reflect the driving characteristics of individuals as much as possible, begin monitoring the driver when a driver starts driving and calculates the driver model, and supports them with a model that makes the driver feel quite normal. That is the construction of Tailormade Driving Support Systems (TDSS). This research proposes a concept and a framework of TDSS, and presents a driver model that uses a neural network to build the system.

The reason for this, according to Johan at Holmen Timber, is that transport costs account for a larger share of the value of goods for sawn timber than for pulp and paper. Railway transport implies huge costs associated with handling, making <b>door-to-door</b> <b>transport</b> by truck a more cost effective alternative. Long shipping distances are required to compensate for the extra handling costs. As for sawn timber, a modal shift to road transport is more likely than to rail when the sulphur limits of 2015 are implemented.|$|E

In the beginning, containerisation was nothing more than a simple technical innovation.

These organisational factors challenged transport actors, who had to redefine the demarcation lines between their respective businesses in order to bring reliable <b>door-to-door</b> <b>transport</b> chains with a global reach into operation. The opportunities that containerisation offered would have remained a dead letter had they not coincided with the deep upheavals in economic factors since the 1970 s.

40|$|The inland {{repositioning}} {{of empty}} containers {{is a crucial}} problem for shipping companies providing <b>door-to-door</b> <b>transport</b> services to customers.

To address the inland repositioning of empty containers, we propose a time-extended optimization model, whose innovative elements are decision variables and constraints on the so-called flexible leased containers, which can be on-hired and off-hired according to a number of clauses, and substitution options between container types. The experimentation shows that the model is an effective instrument to support the current decision-making process on this issue, because realistic size instances can be solved within time limits imposed by planning operations...|$|E
