5|$|After {{crossing}} a bridge, {{they reached the}} gardens {{in front of the}} palace, and Moberly noticed a lady sketching on the grass who looked at them. She later described what she saw in great detail: the lady was wearing a light summer dress, on <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> a shady white hat, and she had lots of fair hair. Moberly thought she was a tourist at first, but the dress appeared to be old-fashioned. Moberly came to believe that the lady was Marie Antoinette. Jourdain, however, did not see the lady.|$|E
5|$|The writers {{intended}} to play off {{the idea of}} a hidden character being able to hear conversations revealing secrets. An initial idea of Pemberton's was to have a large parcel on a table at the birthday party, but with Maggie—on whose birthday the episode would be set—absent. Other characters would repeatedly ask where Maggie was, until it was revealed that <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> in the parcel. This idea developed into the possibility of a hollow cake hiding a character, a device used in the final episode. For the writers, there is humour in characters spending time talking earnestly to a cake; they noted that the prop cake had features resembling a face. In the editing stage, the production team kept reintroducing the cake in order to remind viewers of its presence. The original script ended with a knife being plunged into a fake cake followed by the revelation, contrary to viewers' expectations, that no one was under it at the time; instead, the writers upped the drama in the story, making it possible that any of the characters injured. For the writers, the original plot was, in a sense, darker, as some characters got away with wrongdoing in a way they do not in the final version.|$|E
25|$|A week later, {{several of}} the royal family's attendants, among them the princesse de Lamballe, were taken for {{interrogation}} by the Paris Commune. Transferred to the La Force prison, after a rapid judgment, Marie Louise de Lamballe was savagely killed on 3 September. <b>Her</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> affixed on a pike and paraded through {{the city to the}} Temple for the queen to see.

She was subject to many failed attempts at theft (including by students from Amherst's rival Williams College) and several acts of vandalism, including a decapitation in 1941. (<b>Her</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> welded back in place shortly thereafter.) The administration attempted to discourage further thefts by falsely claiming that the statue had been filled with concrete and welded to its base.|$|E

25|$|Two Vizsla bitches (Zsuzsi and Csibi), {{both of whom}} {{combined}} excellent pedigrees {{with good}} working ability, were selected to breed with a totally liver colored German Wirehaired Pointer sire (Astor von Potat). Zsuzsi’s sire was known to have offspring with longer coats. The best of Zsuzsi’s and Csibi’s offspring were selected and bred together and Dia de Selle, the first WHV to be exhibited, was born. She had the same body as the shorthaired vizsla, but <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> {{the shape of the}} German Wirehaired Pointer. While her coat was not rough and thick enough, she was the promising beginning of the creation of the new breed.|$|E

25|$|Coleman and Brown bicycled into Norwood on July 13 {{at about}} 9:30a.m. Less {{than three hours}} later, they drove away in a car {{belonging}} to Harry Walters, who was unconscious, and his wife, Marlene, 43, who had been raped and beaten to death. Harry Walters survived and later testified that Coleman and Brown inquired about a camper he had offered for sale. While Walters {{sat on the couch}} and discussed the trailer title with Coleman, Coleman picked up a wooden candlestick and, after admiring it, hit Walters {{on the back of the}} head with it. The impact of the blow broke the candlestick and drove a chunk of bone against Mr. Walters' brain, and he remembered little else of the incident beyond that point. Sheri Walters, Harry and Marlene's daughter, returned home from work at about 3:45p.m., where she found her mother dead at the bottom of the basement steps, and her father still alive. Both had ligatures around their throats and electrical cords tied around their bare feet, her father's hands were handcuffed behind his back, while her mother's hands were bound behind her back and <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> covered with a bloody sheet. The coroner indicated Marlene Walters had been bludgeoned on the head approximately 20 to 25 times, with twelve lacerations, some of which were made with a pair of locking pliers, covered her face and scalp. The back of her skull was crushed to pieces, and parts of her skull and brain were missing. The living room hallway and basement were splattered with blood, and shards of a broken soda bottle, bearing Coleman's fingerprints, were found in the living room. Strands of Marlene Walters' hair were found on a bloodstained magazine rack located in the living room, and bloody footprints made by two different kinds of shoes were found in the basement. The Walters' car, a red Plymouth Reliant, was missing, as well as money, jewelry, and shoes which had been stolen. Two bicycles, clothes and shoes not belonging to the Walters had been left behind.|$|E

Forty extra editions came out the day Phagan's murder was reported. The Atlanta Georgian published a doctored morgue photo of Phagan, in which <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> shown spliced onto the body of another girl. The papers offered a total of $1,800 in reward money for information leading to the apprehension of the murderer. [...] Soon after the murder, Atlanta's mayor criticized the police for their steady release of information to the public. The governor, noting the reaction of the public to press sensationalism soon after Lee's and Frank's arrests, organized ten militia companies in case they were needed to repulse mob action against the prisoners. Coverage of the case in the local press continued nearly unabated throughout the investigation, trial, and subsequent appeal process.|$|E

[...] Oyelowo also responded to the controversy, believing that it came from a result of Faulkner's male fans. Comedian Charlie Brooker however, commended the scene, as well as the series in general, stating in his Guardian column: [...] "The moment <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> forced into the deep-fat-fryer, viewers reared on the formulaic, it'll-be-alright-in-the-end blandness of cookie-cutter populist dramas like Casualty and Merseybeat sat up and blinked in disbelief: here was a major BBC drama series that actually had the nerve to confound expectation."

500|$|In Tony Johnston's 2005 book, Neighbours: 20 Years of Ramsay Street, Charlene placed {{sixth in}} the twenty classic {{characters}} chapter. Johnston said Charlene and her mother represented [...] "the old and the new", that her career choice was unusual and her [...] "razor-sharp tongue" [...] put the fear into all the men who lusted after her. Johnston added that the younger female viewers admired Charlene, while the boys loved her feisty nature. In her book Soap Opera, Dorothy Hobson believed Charlene broke stereotypes, especially {{when it came to}} careers for women in the 1980s. She wrote, [...] "The sight {{of one of the most}} attractive female characters, dressed in overalls, with her cascading blonde curls tied up on top of <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>was</b> one of the most positive images for breaking the stereotypes of what jobs are suitable for girls." [...] Hobson also praised Charlene's on-screen relationship with Scott branding the positive images for young people as [...] "immense". The BBC News noted that Charlene became one of Neighbours most popular characters.|$|E
500|$|On April 21, 1913, Phagan {{was laid}} off due to a {{shortage}} of brass sheet metal. Around noon on April 26, {{she went to the}} factory to claim her pay of $1.20. The next day, shortly before 3:00a.m., the factory's night watchman, Newt Lee, went to the factory basement to use the toilet. After leaving the toilet, Lee discovered Phagan's body {{in the rear of the}} basement near an incinerator and called the police. Her dress was up around her waist and a strip from her petticoat had been torn off and wrapped around her neck. Her face was blackened and scratched, and <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> bruised and battered. A [...] strip of [...] wrapping cord was tied into a loop around her neck, buried [...] deep, showing that she had been strangled.

500|$|The {{first series}} {{attracted}} controversy for its second episode, which saw {{the demise of}} a main character after her hand and head were forced into a deep fryer. The scene attracted over 250 complaints, 154 {{of them to the}} television watchdog, the Broadcasting Standards Commission, the highest number of complaints for a television programme in 2002. Following the complaints, the BBC admitted that the scene [...] "clearly disturbed" [...] several viewers, but defended it as it was showing the audience [...] "the kind of threat which might be faced by agents engaged in the fight against terrorism." [...] The Broadcasting Standards Commission stated the scene was shocking, but [...] "in the context was acceptable and important for the later narrative". However the watchdog still criticised the BBC for failing to warn viewers of the violence to come in the scene. The controversy sparked a response from comedian Charlie Brooker in his Guardian column, stating: [...] "The moment <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> forced into the deep-fat-fryer, viewers reared on the formulaic, it'll-be-alright-in-the-end blandness of cookie-cutter populist dramas like Casualty and Merseybeat sat up and blinked in disbelief: here was a major BBC drama series that actually had the nerve to confound expectation." ...|$|E
500|$|Canning reappeared {{at about}} 10pm on 29January 1753. [...] At {{the sight of}} her daughter, whom she had not seen for almost a month, Elizabeth Canning fainted. [...] Once {{recovered}} she sent James Lord to fetch several neighbours, and inside only a few minutes the house was full. [...] Elizabeth was described as being in a [...] "deplorable condition"; her face and hands were black with dirt, she wore a shift, a petticoat, and a bedgown. [...] A dirty rag tied around <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> soaked with blood from a wounded ear. [...] According to her story she had been attacked by two men near Bedlam Hospital. [...] They had partially stripped her, robbed her and hit her in the temple, rendering her unconscious. [...] She awoke [...] "by a large road, where was water, with the two men that robbed me" [...] and was forced to walk to a house, where an old woman asked if she would [...] "go their way" [...] (become a prostitute). [...] Canning had refused, and the woman cut off her corset, slapped her face and pushed her upstairs into a loft. [...] There the young maidservant had remained for almost a month, with no visitors and existing only on bread and water. [...] The clothing she wore she had scavenged from a fireplace in the loft. [...] Canning had eventually made her escape by pulling some boards away from a window and walking the five-hour journey home. [...] She recalled hearing the name [...] "Wills or Wells", and as she had seen through the window a coachman she recognised, thought she had been held on the Hertford Road. [...] On this evidence, John Wintlebury and a local journeyman, Robert Scarrat, identified the house as that of [...] "Mother" [...] Susannah Wells at Enfield Wash, nearly [...] distant.|$|E
500|$|Capper had not died {{immediately}} as her murderers believed, {{and after}} they left she managed to scramble back up the embankment and stagger along the lane for approximately {{a quarter of a}} mile (400 m) to Compstall Road before being found at 06:10 by Barry Sutcliffe and two of his colleagues on their way to work. She told them: [...] "Over there, in the field. They burnt me, they put petrol on me." [...] They immediately took her to a nearby house and roused the residents, Michael and Margaret Coop, to call for an ambulance. Michael Coop said: [...] "Both her hands appeared like ash. Her legs were just like raw meat and her feet appeared to be badly charred. I was struck by how polite the victim was. She was constantly thanking my wife for her assistance." [...] Margaret Coop said: [...] "I instinctively went to put my arms around her but she pulled away because she could not bear to be touched. <b>Her</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> shaved and there were recent, not new, cuts to her head. Her face was almost featureless. Her hands were red raw and black at the fingertips. Her legs were red from top to bottom. She couldn't bear anything near her legs." [...] Capper drank six glasses of water, but was unable to hold the glass herself because of the injuries to her hands. Margaret Coop said: [...] "She looked like the victim of an attack in the Vietnam war. But I felt she would survive. I had this theory that, now she had got to somewhere she could be helped, she would live." [...] Capper was rushed to the hospital and was able to give the names of her six assailants and Powell's address before falling into a coma. The extent of her burns was such that her mother and stepfather were unable to recognise her, and she was positively identified by a partial fingerprint from her thumb, the only part of her hands not severely burned. She died on 18 December 1992, without regaining consciousness.|$|E
