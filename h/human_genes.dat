5|$|Following Asilomar, new genetic {{engineering}} techniques and applications developed rapidly. DNA sequencing methods improved greatly (pioneered by Frederick Sanger and Walter Gilbert), as did oligonucleotide synthesis and transfection techniques. Researchers learned {{to control the}} expression of transgenes, and were soon racing—in both academic and industrial contexts—to create organisms capable of expressing <b>human</b> <b>genes</b> {{for the production of}} human hormones. However, this was a more daunting task than molecular biologists had expected; developments between 1977 and 1980 showed that, due to the phenomena of split genes and splicing, higher organisms had a much more complex system of gene expression than the bacteria models of earlier studies. The first such race, for synthesizing human insulin, was won by Genentech. This {{marked the beginning of the}} biotech boom (and with it, the era of gene patents), with an unprecedented level of overlap between biology, industry, and law.|$|E
25|$|GeneCards is a {{database}} of <b>human</b> <b>genes</b> that provides genomic, proteomic, transcriptomic, genetic and functional information on all known and predicted <b>human</b> <b>genes.</b> It is being developed and maintained by the Crown Human Genome Center at the Weizmann Institute of Science.|$|E

40|$|The study {{analyzes}} the ethical implications of <b>human</b> <b>gene</b> transfer technology for enhancement. Although <b>human</b> <b>gene</b> transfer technology is widely accepted on therapeutic grounds the non-therapeutic use of gene transfer technology {{remains to be}} a gray zone for moral deliberation. The present discussion addresses several ethical issues concerning the impacts of <b>human</b> <b>gene</b> transfer technology on individuals, the society, and future people. Accordingly, the study examines major ethical issues concerning the use of <b>human</b> <b>gene</b> transfer technology in general and genetic enhancement in particular, and reliability of the putative demarcation between therapy and enhancement, and further proposes ethical guidelines for non-therapeutic application of <b>human</b> <b>gene</b> transfer technology. A special attention is given to three major ethical issues, such as our obligation to future generations, problems concerning justice, fairness, and equality, {{and the problem of}} uncertainty...|$|R

25|$|However, the {{information}} provided by the primary sequence databases (lower level database) focus on different aspect. To gather these scattered data, The Weizmann Institute of Science Crown Human Genome Centre developed a database called ‘GeneCards’ in 1997. This database mainly deals with the human genome information, <b>human</b> <b>genes,</b> the encoded proteins’ functions, and the related diseases.|$|E

25|$|The exact {{size of the}} GPCR {{superfamily}} is unknown, {{but nearly}} 800 different <b>human</b> <b>genes</b> (or ~ 4% of the entire protein-coding genome) have been predicted to code for them from genome sequence analysis. Although numerous classification schemes have been proposed, the superfamily was classically divided into three main classes (A, B and C) with no detectable shared sequence homology between classes.|$|E
25|$|This {{database}} aims at {{providing a}} quick {{overview of the}} current available biomedical information about the searched gene, including the <b>human</b> <b>genes,</b> the encoded proteins, and the relevant diseases. The GeneCards database provides access to free Web resources about more than 7000 all known <b>human</b> <b>genes</b> that integrated from >90 data resources, such as HGNC, Ensembl, and NCBI. The core gene list is based on approved gene symbols published by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC). The information are carefully gathered and selected from these databases by the powerful and user-friendly engine. If the search does not return any results, this database will give several suggestions to help users accomplish their searching depended {{on the type of}} query, and offer direct links to other databases’ search engine. Over time, the GeneCards database has developed a suite of tools (GeneDecks, GeneLoc, GeneALaCart) that has more specialised capability. Since 1998, the GeneCards database has been widely used by bioinformatics, genomics and medical communities for more than 15 years.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, the new American {{corporation}} Genentech, after {{collaboration with}} Kabi, developed and started trials of recombinant {{human growth hormone}} (rHGH) made by a new technology (recombinant DNA) in which <b>human</b> <b>genes</b> were inserted into bacteria {{so that they could}} produce unlimited amounts of the protein. Because this was new technology, approval was deferred as lengthy safety trials continued over the next four years.|$|E

25|$|A {{very large}} {{proportion}} of the over 17,000 <b>human</b> <b>genes</b> are thought to {{have an effect on the}} development and functionality of the brain. While a number of individual genes have been reported to be associated with IQ, none have a strong effect. Deary and colleagues (2009) reported that no finding of a strong single gene effect on IQ has been replicated. Recent findings of gene associations with normally varying intelligence differences in adults continue to show weak effects for any one gene; likewise in children.|$|E
25|$|There are an {{estimated}} 19,000-20,000 human protein-coding genes. The estimate {{of the number of}} <b>human</b> <b>genes</b> has been repeatedly revised down from initial predictions of 100,000 or more as genome sequence quality and gene finding methods have improved, and could continue to drop further. Protein-coding sequences account for only a very small fraction of the genome (approximately 1.5%), and the rest is associated with non-coding RNA molecules, regulatory DNA sequences, LINEs, SINEs, introns, and sequences for which as yet no function has been determined.|$|E

25|$|In 2015, {{multiple}} studies {{attempted to}} systematically disable each individual human gene, {{in an attempt}} to identify which genes were essential to human biology. Between 1,600 and 1,800 genes passed this test—of the 20,000 or so known <b>human</b> <b>genes.</b> Such genes are more strongly activated, and unlikely to carry disabling mutations. They {{are more likely to have}} indispensable counterparts in other species. They build proteins that unite to form larger collaborative complexes. The studies also catalogued the essential genes in four cancer-cell lines and identified genes that are expendable in healthy cells, but crucial in specific tumor types and drugs that could target these rogue genes.|$|E
25|$|In {{the field}} of {{biomedical}} research, notably in America, patents were taken out on particular genes, treatments and techniques. From 1991, the NIH permitted patents {{to be taken out}} on anonymous gene fragments. This created extra costs and impediments to creating new treatments and tests. Although in principle rights holders could come together to make a deal, cognitive biases exist in rights owners that can often prevent deals that would likely be beneficial from occurring. For example, tests for certain breast cancer mutations were unavailable since the rights holder for the BRCA human gene did not release them onto the market, which lead to false negative tests for cancer. In the end the courts held that <b>human</b> <b>genes</b> were not patentable.|$|E
25|$|The {{positive}} transcription elongation factor, P-TEFb, {{plays an}} essential role in the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) in eukaryotes. Immediately following initiation Pol II becomes trapped in promoter proximal paused positions on the majority of <b>human</b> <b>genes</b> (Figure 1). P-TEFb is a cyclin dependent kinase that can phosphorylate the DRB sensitivity inducing factor (DSIF) and negative elongation factor (NELF), as well as the carboxyl terminal domain of the large subunit of Pol II and this causes the transition into productive elongation leading to the synthesis of mRNAs. P-TEFb is regulated in part by a reversible association with the 7SK snRNP. Treatment of cells with the P-TEFb inhibitors DRB or flavopidirol leads to loss of mRNA production and ultimately cell death.|$|E
