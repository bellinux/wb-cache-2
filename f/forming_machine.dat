25|$|The forming {{machines}} {{hold and}} move the parts that form the container. The machine consist of basic 19 mechanisms in operation to form a bottle and generally powered by compressed air (high pressure - 3.2 bar and low pressure - 2.8 bar), the mechanisms are electronically timed to coordinate all movements of the mechanisms. The most widely used <b>forming</b> <b>machine</b> arrangement is the individual section machine (or IS machine). This machine has a bank of 5–20 identical sections, each of which contains one complete set of mechanisms to make containers. The sections are in a row, and the gobs feed into each section via a moving chute, called the gob distributor. Sections make either one, two, three or four containers simultaneously. (Referred to as single, double, triple and quad gob). In the case of multiple gobs, the shears cut the gobs simultaneously, and they fall into the blank moulds in parallel.|$|E
2500|$|Kroehl {{applied for}} a patent around March 1854 for a flange <b>forming</b> <b>machine.</b> [...] It is {{described}} in Scientific American as an improvement in machinery for bending flanges on wrought iron beams. [...] There {{is a pair of}} horizontal, and a pair of vertical rollers; the former pair has one roller with a face of the full depth of the beam, and the other has its face the depth of the beam minus the thickness of the flanges. [...] The vertical rollers are both alike, and are of a width a little greater than the extreme width of the flanges. [...] They are arranged opposite the space between the horizontal ones, and work in close contact with the sides of the roller. [...] In order to give the flanges and their beams, a taper or an elliptic, or other curved form, the vertical rollers have flanges, whose faces bear on the edges of the flanges of the beam, and cause the said rollers to receive such a movement in the direction of their axes, and apply such a force I that direction as bends the flanges of the beam to the desired form. [...] Kroehl secured the patent as #12,133 on January 2, 1855.|$|E

2500|$|Glass {{containers}} are 100% inspected; automatic machines, {{or sometimes}} persons, inspect every container {{for a variety}} of faults. Typical faults include small cracks in the glass called checks and foreign inclusions called stones which are pieces of the refractory brick lining of the melting furnace that break off and fall into the pool of molten glass, or more commonly oversized silica granules (sand) that have failed to melt and which subsequently are included in the final product. [...] These are especially important to select out {{due to the fact that}} they can impart a destructive element to the final glass product. [...] For example, since these materials can withstand large amounts of thermal energy, they can cause the glass product to sustain thermal shock resulting in explosive destruction when heated. Other defects include bubbles in the glass called blisters and excessively thin walls. Another defect common in glass manufacturing is referred to as a tear. [...] In the press and blow forming, if a plunger and mould are out of alignment, or heated to an incorrect temperature, the glass will stick to either item and become torn. [...] In addition to rejecting faulty containers, inspection equipment gathers statistical information and relays it to the <b>forming</b> <b>machine</b> operators in the hot end. Computer systems collect fault information and trace it to the mould that produced the container. This is done by reading the mould number on the container, which is encoded (as a numeral, or a binary code of dots) on the container by the mould that made it. Operators carry out a range of checks manually on samples of containers, usually visual and dimensional checks.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Cellular layout is a {{well-known}} solution method to the layout problems in modern batch type production industries. In Cellular manufacturing system (CMS), machines and parts are grouped together based on manufacturing similarities. Generally, zero-one machine-part incidence matrix (MPIM) obtained from the route sheet information is used to <b>form</b> <b>machine</b> cells. The major demerit with such approaches is that real life production factors cannot be accounted for. In an attempt to address generalized cell formation problem, this study considers operational time of the parts processed on each machine. An efficient algorithm based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) is suggested to <b>form</b> <b>machine</b> cells with the combined objective of minimizing total cell load variation and exceptional elements when workload matrix is presented as input. A new grouping efficiency measure called Modified Grouping Efficiency (MGE) is proposed to evaluate the performance of GA. The proposed algorithm is tested with varied sizes of problems from open literature...|$|R
