5|$|Turbo-electric {{propulsion}} {{was selected}} for the battlecruisers despite the fact it needed more room than geared turbines to allow for better underwater protection that wartime experience showed was essential. First used in the s, it also had several other advantages. The turbines could run at their optimum speed, without regard to propeller speed, which was economical on fuel and the machinery could be easily sub-divided which increased the ships' ability to withstand torpedo hits. The substitution of flexible electric cables for bulky steam-lines meant that the motors could be mounted further {{to the rear of}} the ship, which reduced both vibration and weight by shortening the propeller shafts. Also, the ship could <b>go</b> <b>astern</b> at full power simply by reversing the electrical polarity of the motors. Despite these factors and the fact that American companies would have struggled to produce the very large geared steam turbines needed for such big ships, the Curtis Company tried unsuccessfully to convince the Navy to reverse this decision. The Navy countered that doing so would mean a complete rearrangement of machinery spaces and a reduction in underwater protection.|$|E
500|$|Turbo-electric {{propulsion}} {{had been}} chosen for the battlecruisers because American companies struggled to produce the very large geared turbines necessary for such big ships and was retained when they were converted into aircraft carriers.

Another was the ability to <b>go</b> <b>astern</b> at full power without needing a separate reverse turbine to do so, simply by reversing the electrical polarity of the motors. Other benefits were the ability to operate all four propellers if one of the turbo generators failed, and the possibility of operating only some of the generators at low speed with suitably higher loading and greater efficiency.

60|$|There was a crash, and Kit {{jumped from}} the locker. Mossamedes stopped and the shock threw him against a column. He seized the iron and held on, {{conscious}} that he trembled. The jar was terrifying {{because it was not}} expected. A sea broke about the vessel, she shook and water rolled across the deck. A greaser shouted and Kit saw Macallister on the grated platform above. He had not seen him go, but his hand was on the throttle-wheel. He did not look disturbed, and signed a man to the control of the reversing-gear. If the link were pulled across, the engines would <b>go</b> <b>astern.</b> The telegraph, however, was silent and Macallister did not turn the wheel.|$|E
60|$|Then {{they were}} <b>gone</b> <b>astern.</b> The {{spritsail}} {{filled with the}} wind, suddenly, careening the frail open craft till it seemed it would surely capsize. A whitecap foamed above it and broke across in a snow-white smother. Then the boat emerged, half swamped, Leach flinging the water out and Johnson clinging to the steering-oar, his face white and anxious.|$|R

50|$|On 19 April 1911, Koombana was the {{innocent}} {{victim of a}} collision while tied up at Victoria Quay. The master of another steamer, SS Pilbarra, became confused by the hoisting of berthing flags. He <b>went</b> <b>astern,</b> to prevent his vessel from striking the wharf.

60|$|By {{this time}} the ship was passing above the town of Arica, and the sailors were all for'd, sitting on the bulwarks, {{snapping}} peas and small shot at the terrified inhabitants flitting through the streets a hundred feet below. These harmless projectiles rattled very merrily upon the upturned boot-soles of the fleeting multitude; but not seeing any fun in this, {{we were about to}} <b>go</b> <b>astern</b> and fish a little, when the ship grounded on a hill-top. The captain hove out all the anchors he had about him; and when the water went swirling back to its legal level, taking the town along for company, there we were, {{in the midst of a}} charming agricultural country, but at some distance from any sea-port.|$|E

6000|$|At first {{all seemed}} about to go well. A gale was indeed blowing at the time, {{but that did not}} much affect the colossal ship. The cable was cut, {{fastened}} to its iron rope, passed to the bow, and got in over the pulleys. Then, and very slowly, it was drawn on board. When a mile or so had been recovered, the gearing of one of the engines got a little out of order, and the process had to be temporarily stopped; then something went wrong with the boilers, but soon these difficulties were removed. Immediately after, the Great Eastern drifted, so {{that it was impossible to}} prevent the cable from chafing against her bows. Equally impossible was it to <b>go</b> <b>astern,</b> lest the strain should be too great. Then the wind suddenly shifted, making matters worse. Suddenly the chain shackle and wire-rope attached to the cable came in over the wheel at the bows with considerable violence. Another moment and the cable parted, flew through the stoppers, and, with one bound, flashed into the sea and disappeared! ...|$|E

60|$|The ship's {{head was}} thrown into the wind, and we were brought to as quickly as possible.

60|$|Once outside, he squared {{the sail}} and ran {{right before the}} breeze. Of course such a weighty craft went very slowly through the water, but the wind was pretty strong, and to Jarwin, who had been for a {{comparatively}} long time unaccustomed to moving on the water, the speed seemed fast enough. As the island <b>went</b> <b>astern,</b> and the raft lifted and fell gently on the long swell of the ocean, the seaman's heart beat with a peculiar joy to which it had long been a stranger, and he thanked God fervently for having so soon answered his prayer.|$|R
60|$|Here Lanty {{was called}} on to assist Hebert in {{identifying}} his lady's bales of goods, when all those of the unfortunate Genoese were put on board the corsair's vessel. A sail-cloth partition was extended across the deck by {{the care of the}} Dutchman, 'who'--as Lanty said--'for a haythen apostate was a very dacent man.' He evidently had a strong compassion and fellow- feeling for the Christian lady, and assured her that she might safely take the air and sit on deck as much as she pleased behind its shelter; and he likewise carefully selected the seven of his crew whom he sent on board to work the ship, the chief being a heavy-looking old Turk, with a chocolate-coloured visage between a huge white beard and eyebrows, and the others mere lads, except one, who, from an indefinable European air about him, was evidently a renegade, and could speak a sort of French, so as to hold communication with the captives, especially Lanty, who was much quicker than any of the rest in picking up languages, perhaps from having from his infancy talked French and English (or rather Irish), and likewise learnt Latin with his foster-brother. This man was the only one permitted to <b>go</b> <b>astern</b> of the partition, in case of need, to attend to the helm; but the vessel was taken in tow by the corsair, and needed little management. The old Turk seemed to regard the Frankish women like so many basilisks, and avoided turning a glance in their direction, roaring at his crew if he only saw them approaching the sail-cloth, and keeping a close watch upon the lithe black-eyed youths, whose brown limbs carried them up the mast with the agility of monkeys. There was one in especial--a slight, well-made fellow about twenty, with a white turban cleaner than the rest--who contrived to cast wonderful glances from the masthead over the barrier at Rosette, who actually smiled in return at ce pauvre garcon, and smiled the more for Mademoiselle Julienne's indignation. Suddenly, however, a shrill shout made him descend hastily, and the old Turk's voice might be heard in its highest key, no doubt shrieking out maledictions on all the ancestry of the son of a dog who durst defile his eyes with gazing at the shameless daughters of the Frank. Little Ulysse was, however, allowed to disport himself wherever he pleased; and after once, under Arthur's protection, going forward, he found himself made very welcome, and offered various curiosities, such as shells, corals, and a curious dried little hippocampus or seahorse.|$|E

50|$|Captain Sherman {{slowed to}} 10 kn, {{ordering}} the rudder put to port {{to try to}} get the wind on the starboard bow; he then <b>went</b> <b>astern</b> with right rudder until the wind was on the starboard quarter, in an attempt to keep the fire forward. At that point, flames made the central station unusable, and communication circuits went dead. Soon, a serious gasoline fire broke out in the forward portion of the hangar; within 24 minutes of the initial attack, there were three additional major gasoline vapor explosions. Ten minutes later Sherman decided to abandon ship as the firefighting was ineffectual. Survivors would have to disembark quickly to minimize loss of life.|$|R
60|$|The Mark Boat {{was below}} {{and a little}} to the sou'west of us, {{fluctuating}} in the centre of her distraught galaxy. The air was thick with moving lights at every level. I take it most of them were trying to lie head to wind but, not being hydras, they failed. An under-tanked Moghrabi boat had risen to the limit of her lift and, finding no improvement, had dropped a couple of thousand. There she met a superb wulli-wa and was blown up spinning like a dead leaf. Instead of shutting off she <b>went</b> <b>astern</b> and, naturally, rebounded as from a wall almost into the Mark Boat, whose language (our G. C. took it in) was humanly simple.|$|R
60|$|Arcturus {{rolled and}} sheered about, putting a horrible {{strain on the}} hawsers, and {{sometimes}} {{for a minute or}} two it looked as if she <b>went</b> <b>astern.</b> Flame blew from the tug's funnel, lighting the black trail of smoke; steam roared at her escape-pipe, and the engines throbbed hard. The ebb tide, however, was beginning to run and helped her across the shoals. The leadsman got deeper water, the rollers got smooth, and presently the swell was long and regular and the spray cloud melted astern. In the morning, a faint dark line to starboard was all that indicated the African coast. Next day Brown steered for the land and called Montgomery to the bridge.|$|R
50|$|Shortly before grounding, {{an attempt}} was made to <b>go</b> <b>astern</b> but this failed when the stress {{fractured}} the ship's propeller. Driven onto the sandbank, the vessel began to take on water and as the tide rose she failed to lift off the shoal as had been expected. When the sea began to break over her, and the wind rose to gale force, the order was given to abandon ship, causing some panic. One boat was launched, but was swamped, while a second boat, with the quartermaster, a sailor and a passenger aboard, went adrift and eventually reached shore on the Isle of Sheppey the next day with only the quartermaster left alive. The remaining boats were later washed away or destroyed by the stormy seas.|$|E
50|$|On 22 August 1898, {{the ferry}} Narrabeen left Manly at 07:15 {{and ran into}} a dense bank of foe shortly after leaving, and had {{to slow down and}} proceed {{cautiously}} up the harbour.

Speed had just been got on the boat again after backing out, when the cry again came to <b>go</b> <b>astern.</b> This time it was too late, as there was seen coming {{around the corner of the}} island the Government steamer Kate towing a powder lighter bound for Broken Bay. The Narrabeen struck the Kate just forward of amidships, tearing a large hole in the woodwork. The engines of both steamers were going astern. The captain and crew, of the Kate scrambled aboard the Narrabeen with the Kate soon disappearing stern first.|$|E

60|$|At {{that moment}} {{one of the}} pirates, who from his dress and bearing seemed to occupy a {{position}} of authority, stepped upon the platform and looked at him. He gave a brief order {{to one of his}} comrades, who brought a large piece of cork and fastened it to the slave's neck. He also brought a short spear, with a little flag at its handle. This he thrust a few inches into the fleshy part of his shoulder, and then pushed him off the platform into the sea.

5000|$|Fullastern Rock (...) is an {{isolated}} submerged rock {{lying in the}} middle of Johnston Passage 7 nmi km west-northwest of Cape Adriasola, Adelaide Island.

60|$|He did, for {{the most}} part, very little on board the Estremedura, and took life as easily as he could, {{but there was another}} side of his nature which, though it had been little stirred as yet, came {{uppermost}} then, as it did occasionally when he brought his despatches off at night in an open roadstead through the trade-wind surf. It was also known to the Estremedura's skipper that he had once swum off to the steamer from the roaring beach at Orotava when no fishermen in the little port would launch a barquillo out. Thus he felt himself in entire sympathy with Jefferson as every big comber hove the launch up and the spray lashed his tingling skin, while for five anxious minutes the issue hung in the balance. Launch and lighter <b>went</b> <b>astern</b> with the heavier seas, and barely recovered the lost ground in the smooths when a roller failed to break quite so fiercely as its predecessors.|$|R

5000|$|Fundamental to {{low-speed}} maneuvering is {{an understanding}} of the configuration and handedness of the propeller(s). An effect known as propeller walk will kick the stern of the vessel to port or starboard depending on the configuration and the type of propeller when large variations on propeller rotation speed or changes of propeller rotation direction take place. (In single-screw vessels where the rotation of the propeller is reversed on an astern bell, a standard was established that the propeller would turn clockwise when viewed from astern. This would mean that the propeller would turn counterclockwise when going astern and the stern would walk to port. This aided in docking operations, where [...] "port side to" [...] was the preferred situation and the vessel would be brought to the dock with a small bow-in angle and backing would flatten the angle, slow or stop the vessel and walk it alongside. An exception to this was the U.S. Sealift class tankers, which used a controllable-pitch propeller, where the pitch and not the direction of rotation was reversed to <b>go</b> <b>astern.</b> These propellers rotated counterclockwise at all times and so the [...] "walk" [...] was [...] "normal".) Other variations include what are known as bucket rudders such as the Kortz Nozzle where instead of a conventional rudder a pair of dish-shaped rudders, one either side of the propeller can be swivelled vertically to direct the propeller thrust through 360 degrees. Thus to put the vessel into astern mode the rudder can be rotated through 180 degrees without altering the speed and direction of the engine. Since with the conventional propeller or rudder configuration the propeller is designed to operate at maximum efficiency when going ahead, it produces far less thrust when going astern. But with the Kortz Nozzle, the ahead and astern thrust is the same. Other advantages of the nozzle are the ship can be steered astern which a conventional rudder cannot, and the ship can be steered fully under control to a standstill switching between ahead and astern mode to give complete control over speed. In addition to being fully conversant with the principles of seamanship and ship-handling, a good pilot will have developed his or her sense of 'situational awareness' to a point well beyond that of a member of a ship's crew; his reactions will appear to be instinctive, positive and at all times safe.|$|E

60|$|It is {{the same}} in the engine-room, when the ships come in for their regular looking-over. Those who love them, which you would never guess from the language, know exactly what they need, and get it without fuss.

If, for example, through some trick of her screws not synchronising, a destroyer always casts to port when she <b>goes</b> <b>astern,</b> do not let any zealous soul try to make her run true, or you will have to learn her helm all over again. And it is vital that you should know exactly what your ship is going to do three seconds before she does it. Similarly with men.
