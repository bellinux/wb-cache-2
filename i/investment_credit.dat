40|$|The authors {{developed}} a simple two-period {{general equilibrium model}} to analyze the macroeconomic impact of tax policies in Pakistan. They analyze two scenarios. In scenario 1, the <b>investment</b> tax <b>credit</b> rate is increased from 15 percent to 30 percent. The new fiscal regime increases investment but also significantly increases inflation. In scenario 2, the original <b>investment</b> tax <b>credit</b> rate is retained but the statutory corporate tax rate is reduced. Welfare improves more than under scenario 1. The authors conclude that in Pakistan, at least, changes in corporate tax rates are probably better instruments for promoting capital formation than are increased <b>investment</b> tax <b>credits.</b> In particular, cuts in corporate taxes improve welfare more than do increases in <b>investment</b> tax <b>credits.</b> Increasing the <b>investment</b> tax <b>credit</b> stimulates more capital formation than does decreasing corporate taxes, but the tax credits also have significant macroeconomic consequences.
