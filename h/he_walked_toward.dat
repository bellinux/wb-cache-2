25|$|Huberty {{shot and}} killed a 62-year-old trucker named Laurence Versluis, before {{targeting}} one of the families near the play area of the restaurant, {{who had tried to}} shield their children beneath the tables with their bodies. Blythe Regan Herrera (aged 31) had shielded her 11-year-old son, Mateo, beneath one booth, and her husband protected 12-year-old Keith Thomas under a booth across from them. Huberty began shooting people seated in the restaurant as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> those under the tables. Ronald Herrera urged Thomas not to move, shielding the boy with his body. Thomas was shot in the shoulder, arm, wrist, and left elbow, but was not seriously wounded; Ronald Herrera was shot eight times in the stomach, chest, arm, and head but survived; his wife, Blythe, and son, Mateo, were both killed by numerous gunshots to the head.|$|E
500|$|During {{his tenure}} with the Red Sox and {{especially}} throughout the New England area, the phrase [...] "Yoouuuk!" [...] became a commonplace term; being seen on T-shirts, bumper stickers, and advertising. The phrase represents Youkilis' nickname but also replicates the phonetic spelling of the low, drawn out, guttural cheer that Red Sox fans in attendance would greet Youkilis with as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> the batter's box prior to hitting or after a successful {{play in the}} field.|$|E
2500|$|Carrying {{a bundle}} {{wrapped in a}} {{checkered}} blanket, Huberty looked toward his elder daughter, Zelia, as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> {{the front door of}} the family home and said, [...] "Goodbye. I won't be back." [...] He drove down San Ysidro Boulevard. According to eyewitnesses, he drove first toward the Big Bear supermarket and then toward the U.S. Post Office, before entering the parking lot of a McDonald's restaurant located approximately 200yards from his apartment.|$|E
5000|$|The player spends Daymare Town 4 {{wandering}} {{around in the}} desert, finding objects and interacting with various people. The player finds a ladder on a tall cliff, and climbs it.

2500|$|At {{approximately}} 1:11–1:14p.m., Tippit {{was driving}} slowly eastward on East 10th Street — about [...] past {{the intersection of}} 10th Street and Patton Avenue — when he pulled alongside a man who resembled the police description. Oswald walked over to Tippit's car and apparently exchanged words with him through an open vent window. Tippit opened his car door and as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> {{the front of the}} car, Oswald drew his handgun and fired four shots in rapid succession. One bullet hit Tippit in the chest, one in the stomach, another in his right temple (one bullet hit a button and did not penetrate his skin). Tippit's body was transported from the scene of the shooting by ambulance to Methodist Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 1:25 p.m. by Dr. Richard A. Liguori.|$|E

6000|$|... "I surrender!" [...] he cried, and, {{still with}} his arms above his head, and his face whiter than the distant sands, <b>he</b> slowly <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> the barrier.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "Customer Survey", Darryl {{states that}} {{although}} {{he is not a}} believer in therapy, he thinks that Michael should have some, saying [...] "I'll go into my own pocket to cover his co-pay." [...] In [...] "Business Trip", Kelly breaks up with Darryl, who takes it well as evidenced by how <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>toward</b> his truck after doing it, with an obviously delighted bounce in his step.|$|R

6000|$|... "He {{looks as}} if he were {{suffering}} too," [...] said the Boston physician, and <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> Jethro and laid a hand upon his shoulders. [...] "I give him until winter, my friend," [...] said Dr. Coles.|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed to}} the ex-moonlighter {{as if his}} companions would never return, and once at least during every ten minutes <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> the house, {{in the hope of}} seeing them as they came up the lane.|$|E

60|$|As I {{finished}} I raised Xodar to {{his feet}} and released him. He did not renew the attack upon me, nor did he speak. Instead, <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> the bench, and, sinking down upon it, remained lost in deep thought for hours.|$|E
60|$|Dupin {{said the}} last words in a very low tone, and very quietly. Just as quietly, too, <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> the door, locked it and put the key in his pocket. He then drew a pistol from his bosom and placed it, without the least flurry, upon the table.|$|E
60|$|A {{few minutes}} later he bade the {{policeman}} adieu, and, with {{a slip of paper}} in his pocket bearing a certain address in a semirespectable quarter, <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> briskly <b>toward</b> the nearest taxi stand.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned and}} responded to the {{greeting}} {{of the man who}} had just entered. There was a perceptible drag to the man's feet as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> across <b>toward</b> the window and paused irresolutely halfway.|$|R

60|$|When finally <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> {{the cedar}} the lioness {{stood up and}} growled as if she {{realized}} {{the entrance of the}} chief actor upon the scene.

6000|$|There was no {{answering}} sympathy awakened {{in either}} of his listeners--they remained mute. Bridge rose and stretched.

[...] "'Good-bye girls! I'm through,'" [...] he quoted and passed out into the sunlight.|$|E
60|$|In {{a kind of}} stupefaction Soames {{looked from}} one to the other; then, taking up hat and {{umbrella}} which he had put down on a chair, <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> the curtains. The boy stood aside for him to go by. He passed through and heard the grate of the rings as the curtains were drawn behind him. The sound liberated something in his chest.|$|E

Bosko then proceeds to slide-step to Honey's door and ring her doorbell.|$|R
