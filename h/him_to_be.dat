5|$|Even {{though his}} {{military}} career begun {{almost as an}} afterthought, or by accident, Zamoyski is also remembered {{as one of the}} most accomplished Polish military commanders. In his tactics, he favored sieges, flanking maneuvers, conserving his forces, and the new Western art of fortification and artillery. The war with Muscovy shown <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a skilled commander in sieges, and latter events would prove <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an equally able leader in the open field.|$|E
5|$|The curial {{cardinals}} {{entered the}} conclave seeking to elect Gregorio Barbarigo as pope. Leopold I, the Holy Roman Emperor, considered <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an unacceptable choice {{because he was}} a Venetian. While Leopold did not formally exclude Barbarigo, he did not wish for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> elected. In addition to Leopold, the Spanish ambassador in Rome worked against Barbarigo's election, and Louis XIV of France opposed it because of the wishes of his allies.|$|E
5|$|After the German {{capitulation}} in May 1945, Johnson relocated {{with his}} unit to Copenhagen, Denmark.

5|$|Chabaneau {{was born}} in 1754 in Nontron, a village in the Dordogne {{department}} of France. His uncle, {{a member of the}} order of Saint Anthony, encouraged him to study theology. While Chabaneau excelled in his studies, his distaste for metaphysical speculation led him to antagonize his teachers, which in turn caused <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> expelled from school.|$|E
5|$|Clark {{had little}} formal education. He {{lived with his}} {{grandfather}} {{so that he could}} receive a common education at Donald Robertson's school with James Madison and John Taylor of Caroline. He was also tutored at home, as was usual for Virginian planters' children of the period. His grandfather trained <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a surveyor.|$|E
50|$|Afterwords, Carter {{reveals that}} Anubis did not {{actually}} escape, as she did manage to override the dialing process <b>to</b> send <b>him</b> <b>to</b> an alternate address. The planet she chose <b>to</b> send <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>was</b> extremely cold, so Vaselov's body froze, leaving Anubis unable to dial a new address.|$|R

5|$|Coutances {{was usually}} given {{the title of}} magister, which {{signified}} that he had received an education in a school; most likely he attended the schools of Paris. Gerald of Wales said that Coutances was dedicated to learning, and considered <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a talented courtier.|$|E
5|$|Du Bois's output at Atlanta University was prodigious, {{in spite}} of a limited budget: he {{produced}} numerous social science papers and annually hosted the Atlanta Conference of Negro Problems. Du Bois also received grants from the U.S. government to prepare reports about African-American workforce and culture. His students considered <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a brilliant, but aloof and strict, teacher.|$|E

5|$|Hobbs was an {{occasional}} medium-paced bowler who bowled a good length {{and made the}} ball swing. Some critics judged <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a potentially good bowler, but both Surrey and England were reluctant for him to bowl regularly, fearing it would affect his batting. As a fielder, Hobbs improved greatly from his early days. He fielded in the covers and was expert in cutting off potential runs and returning the ball quickly to the wicket-keeper. Contemporaries believed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{one of the best}} cover fielders there had been, and remarked on his powers of anticipation in getting to the ball. They also noted he sometimes deceived batsmen with his casual attitude and occasional deliberate mis-fields; these would be followed by very sharp fielding which often produced a run out.|$|E
5|$|In October 1952, Holloman {{was signed}} by the St. Louis Browns after they traded Duke Markell and $35,000 to acquire him. Heading into the season, manager Marty Marion was high on him, {{considering}} <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a pitcher who could have won 20 games with Syracuse the year prior had he not missed time due to an appendectomy.|$|E
5|$|Labour leader Neil Kinnock was {{expected}} to ask <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> government chief whip if Labour won the 1987 general election, but Dormand thought it right to retire {{at the age of}} 67. His successor John Cummings was the first miner to become MP for the area.|$|E

5|$|Nothing {{has been}} {{preserved}} {{of the work}} of Talhaearn, Blwchfardd and Cian, but poems attributed to Taliesin were published by Ifor Williams in Canu Taliesin and were considered by <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> comparable in antiquity to the Gododdin. This poetry praises Urien of Rheged and his son Owain, and refers to Urien as lord of Catraeth.|$|E
5|$|On December 27, 1996, the Texas Rangers signed Ramírez as an infielder, believing <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 16 {{instead of}} 15. After one season with their Dominican affiliate, he was {{released}} on June 4, 1998.|$|E

5|$|One {{result of}} Wallace's early travels {{is a modern}} {{controversy}} about his nationality. Since Wallace was born in Monmouthshire, some sources have considered <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Welsh. However, some historians have questioned this because neither of his parents was Welsh, his family only briefly lived in Monmouthshire, the Welsh people Wallace knew in his childhood considered <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> English, and because Wallace himself consistently referred to himself as English rather than Welsh (even when writing about his time in Wales). One Wallace scholar has stated that the most reasonable interpretation is therefore {{that he was an}} Englishman born in Wales.|$|E

5|$|The {{plan was}} straightforward: Vandamme and Saint Cyr {{would make a}} {{simultaneous}} attack on the Austrian right, and Soult's and Jourdan's main force would attack the Austrian center and left. Jourdan's plan, to attack four points of the opposition simultaneously, seemed to <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the only reasonable action against a force with such numerical superiority.|$|E
