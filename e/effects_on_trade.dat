60|$|Here the orator drew {{a picture}} of war that caused {{suffering}} monikinity to shudder. He viewed it in its four leading points: its religious, its pecuniary, its political, and its domestic penalties. He described war to be the demon state of the monikin mind; as opposed to worship, to charity, brotherly love, and all the virtues. On its pecuniary penalties, he touched by exhibiting a tax-sheet. Buttons which cost sixpence a gross, he assured the house, would shortly cost sevenpence a gross.--Here he was reminded that monikins no longer wore buttons.--No matter, they bought and sold buttons, and the <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>trade</b> were just the same. The political penalties of war he fairly showed to be frightful; but {{when he came to}} speak of the domestic penalties, there was not a dry eye in the house.

However, the greatest blow to the wealth of the town came in the last war between Sweden and Russia in 1808, which saw the Russians capture and annexe Finland. The border was drawn through the deepest channel of the Muonio and Tornio rivers, splitting Lapland into two parts, with deleterious <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>trade.</b> Tornio ended up on the Russian side of the border by special request of the Russian czar.

40|$|The {{completion}} of the European Community's single-market programme will stimulate the European economy and affect {{the rest of the}} world principally through its <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>trade</b> among EC member states and on the Community's external trade. Although there has been much discussion of the effects of ' 1992 ' on international trade, there has been relatively little detailed analysis of the issues involved. This volume offers a major re-appraisal of the effect of completing the EC's single-market programme on trade among EC member states and also on the Community's external trade. Individual chapters assess the effects of ' 1992 ' on competition if transport costs and taste differences remain; detailed case-studies show that integration has complex <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>trade</b> flows and prices and stress the importance of devising a satisfactory international trade policy for the completed market; other chapters estimate the elasticities of demand for imports...|$|E

We extend much {{research}} that {{has been devoted to}} the effects of the EMU on international trade by introducing monetary regime variables in bilateral export equations with the objective of capturing the <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>trade</b> of changes in monetary regimes relative the pure EMU effects. In addition, we make a strong attempt to distinguish between EU and EMU <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>trade.</b> To identify these different effects we include three groups of countries in our sample: EMU countries which are also members of the EU, EU countries outside the EMU and non-EU countries. The last control group consists of either non-EU industrial countries or non-EU industrial plus emerging market countries in the empirical analysis. Asian experiences with inflation targeting are discussed and compared to the empirical results we obtain for trade effects of monetary regimes. Even if deeper monetary integration leads to greater trade expansion, it involves political complexity. The choice of an appropriate monetary regime can be a relatively simple unilateral tool for expanding trade...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the central}} topics of {{the debate about the}} {{advantages}} and disadvantages of EMU is whether exchange rate variability has positive or negative <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>trade.</b> Advocates of a regime of fixed rates emphasised its advantages in terms of co-ordination and credibility of economic policies, as well as its role in promoting international trade. The supporters of flexible exchange rates highlight its greater capacity to achieve domestic policy objectives. They also say there are no negative <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>trade</b> as financial mechanisms can assure risks derived from it. Although there is an extensive literature on this topic, there is no clear conclusion about it. In fact, most empirical studies have failed to obtain a clear significant relationship between both variables (exchange rate variability and trade – growth-). The objective of this paper is not to test the existence or not of this relationship but to make a preliminary description of the potential explanatory factors of the different results by previous authors. With this aim, data for the European Union countries for the period 1973 - 1997 relating trade and exchange rates is analysed using different econometric techniques in the framework of a gravity model...|$|E
