He would retain personal control of the business, but would not receive any interest, fees or salary, living on the repayment of the loan stock.

Spain raised his cash offer, offering Te Rauparaha another £100 to compensate for lost crops if he ensured Taringa Kuri left the valley immediately.

Submissions by the Crown in the 1999 Ngāti Awa investigation and a 1995 settlement with Waikato-Tainui included an acknowledgement that confiscations from that tribe were unjust and a breach of the Treaty <b>of</b> Waitangi.

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s Tainui opted {{to bypass the}} Waitangi Tribunal and {{concluded}} a treaty claims settlement with the Crown through direct negotiation. In May 1995 the Crown signed a <b>deed</b> <b>of</b> <b>settlement</b> with Waikato–Tainui that included cash and land valued at $170 million.

It formally and publicly apologised to Waikato–Tainui and the Kingitanga for unjustly invading Waikato–Tainui lands, for sending imperial forces across the Mangataawhiri, and {{for the loss of}} life and the devastation of property that ensued. The Crown expressed profound regret and apologised unreservedly for the invasion and the crippling effects it had on the welfare of the Waikato-Tainui people. Queen Elizabeth II affirmed the apology of the Crown by signing the Waikato Raupatu Claims Settlements Act 1995 in the presences of the head of the Kingitanga, Maori Queen Dame Te Atairangikaahu. As a result of this settlement the Crown agreed to return as much land as possible to Waikato and to pay compensation, and said that it sought on behalf of all New Zealanders to atone for these acknowledged injustices, and {{to begin the process of}} healing and to enter a new age of co-operation with the Kingitanga and Waikato.|$|E

50|$|On {{the death}} of Thomas Thornes his widow {{retained}} possession of Shelvock, and married George Bold, but their right to the property was evidently disputed by the family, for in 1699 a <b>deed</b> <b>of</b> family <b>settlement</b> was executed, dated October 30, between them and several other relatives. By this deed {{it was agreed that}} all differences and lawsuits about the land and estate of the late Francis and Thomas Thornes were to cease. The Bolds were to hold for their lives and to keep in repair the capital messuage of Shelvock, the Heath Mill, and the demesne lands belonging to Shelvock, and several properties in Shotatton which were parcel of the demesne lands of Shelvock. After the deaths of the Bolds, the whole of the above were to belong in fee simple, free from encumbrances, to Francis Thornes' four daughters and their representatives. Anne Bold, therefore, and her second husband, George Bold, had possession of Shelvock from 1678; and they were still alive in 1707, but had to let it to some under-tenants.|$|R

In the earliest years of the town, many of the land grants given by the Plymouth Colony Court were held by investors or speculators who did not live in the town, and frequently swapped and traded their <b>deeds.</b> The <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> the town was largely confined to the area south of the South River.|$|R

This plan succeeded. The pardon was made out, being written with great formality upon a parchment roll, and sealed with the great seal.

6000|$|PAGANUS DE LYSKERET, styled Presbyter, was {{collated}} in 1280. It {{appears that}} at this time there was a perpetual vicar established in the Church of Hursley as well as a rector; and that he was instituted by the bishop, had a certain fixed maintenance assigned to him, and was independent of the rector. In the register of John de Pontissera, Bishop of Winton, may now be seen what is there called the [...] "Ordinatio Episcopi inter Rectorem et Vicarium de Hurslegh." [...] It is therein settled that the vicar shall have a house as described and other emoluments, and that the rector shall pay to him forty shillings per annum.

40|$|This {{paper is}} part of the author’s series of papers {{presenting}} and analysing personal names in the <b>Deed</b> <b>of</b> Foundation of Tihany Abbey. In medieval Hungarian sources, three layers of hagionyms (‘saints’ names’) can be discerned: 1. Hagionyms proper. The denotatum of the name is the particular saint. 2. Patrocinies in the strict sense. These are created by metonymic extension of the saint’s name to the church (less frequently, the religious community) of which the saint is the patron. 3. Place names (typically names <b>of</b> <b>settlements)</b> based on patrocinies. Given that these three uses {{can be traced back to}} one another, in-between cases can also be found. In the text <b>of</b> the <b>Deed</b> <b>of</b> Foundation of Tihany Abbey, examples of all three types can be attested. Although it is a transitional case as far as its connotation is concerned, I take the following to be a hagionym proper: “sanct mari sanctique aniani episcopi & confessoris (sc. ecclesia) ” – ‘(church dedicated to) the Holy Virgin and St Anianus, bishop and confessor’. The following examples represent patrocinies in the strict sense: “qu simul ad sanctum clementem terminantur”– ‘both (roads) end at St Clement’; “tercia namque sancti mich(a) elis” – ‘the third (lake) belongs to St Michael’; and on the verso of the document: “sanct[] mari scilicet & sancti aniani” – ‘(ecclesiastic objects of) the Holy Virgin and St Anianus’. An instance <b>of</b> a <b>settlement</b> name based on a patrociny is the name of Tihany itself. We can observe that both the <b>Deed</b> <b>of</b> Foundation of Tihany Abbey and the medieval practice of writing charters in general use names of the first two types exclusively in Latin (alternatively, Greek), whereas names <b>of</b> <b>settlements</b> based on patrocinies are typically mentioned in Hungarian (or in the relevant vernacular). In this, medieval ecclesiastic and official use of names certainly follows the system of name use of theonyms...|$|R
