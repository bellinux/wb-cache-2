30|$|To {{maintain}} the desired temperature of 37 °C within a perfusion culture container a heating plate (MEDAX-Nagel, Kiel, Germany) and a <b>cover</b> <b>lid</b> (not shown) is used (Figure 2 d). The transport of culture medium is best accomplished using a slowly rotating peristaltic pump (ISMATEC, IPC N 8, Wertheim, Germany), which {{is able to}} provide adjustable pump rates of 0.1 to 5 ml per hour. In personal experiments medium was transported with 1.25 ml/h {{for a period of}} at least 13 days. Adherent cells growing on a mounted tissue carrier are supplied with always fresh medium flowing from the storage bottle to the container. Thus, during long term culture the growing tissue is exposed to always fresh medium preventing in parallel an un-physiological accumulation of metabolic products and an overshoot of paracrine factors. To maintain this controlled environment for the whole culture period, the metabolized medium is not re-circulated but collected in a separate waste bottle.|$|R

Decontamination can work by pore capture and silver disinfection. When contaminate water is pour the tiny pores inside the ceramic pot act as a filter that traps most particles and debris along with larger parasites and bacteria (Elmore et al. 2005). Silver nitrate has the effect of essentially killing and disabling the reproduction of the smallest bacteria that are able to pass through the pores. The silver also helps to prevent mold from growing on the filter surface with time and continued use the pores of the filter diminish in size due to clogging and become more efficient in retaining particulates from the water this pot is typically place inside a plastic bucket with a <b>cover</b> <b>lid</b> to help prevent contamination (Howe et al. 2006).|$|R
