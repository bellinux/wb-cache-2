Wong says his self-awareness, and what Hong Kong represents to him, stem from the years he spent abroad. He says that only by living amidst a second culture can one fully come to realise what one represents and where one belongs. A thread that runs through much of his work is therefore the notion of home, <b>homelessness</b> <b>and</b> wandering. Since 2011, his repertoire {{has taken on a}} political dimension.|$|E
5|$|Since Reagan {{left office}} in 1989, {{substantial}} debate has occurred among scholars, historians, {{and the general}} public surrounding his legacy. Supporters have pointed to a more efficient and prosperous economy as a result of Reagan's economic policies, foreign policy triumphs including a peaceful end to the Cold War, and a restoration of American pride and morale. Proponents also argue Reagan restored faith in the American Dream with his unabated and passionate love for the United States, after a decline in American confidence and self-respect under Jimmy Carter's perceived weak leadership, particularly during the Iran hostage crisis, as well as his gloomy, dreary outlook {{for the future of the}} United States during the 1980 election. Critics contend that Reagan's economic policies resulted in rising budget deficits, a wider gap in wealth, and an increase in <b>homelessness</b> <b>and</b> that the Iran–Contra affair lowered American credibility.|$|E

5|$|From 1969 to 1973, it {{used oil}} {{money to fund}} social welfare programs, which led to house-building {{projects}} and improved healthcare and education. House building became a major social priority, designed to eliminate <b>homelessness</b> <b>and</b> to replace the shanty towns created by Libya's growing urbanization. The health sector was also expanded; by 1978, Libya had 50% more hospitals than it had in 1968, {{while the number of}} doctors had grown from 700 to over 3000 in that decade. Malaria was eradicated, and trachoma and tuberculosis greatly curtailed. Compulsory education was expanded from 6 to 9 years, while adult literacy programs and free university education were introduced. Beida University was founded, while Tripoli University and Benghazi University were expanded. In doing so the government helped to integrate the poorer strata of Libyan society into the education system. Through these measures, the RCC greatly expanded the public sector, providing employment for thousands. These early social programs proved popular within Libya. This popularity was partly due to Gaddafi's personal charisma, youth and underdog status as a Bedouin, as well as his rhetoric emphasizing his role as the successor to the anti-Italian fighter Omar Mukhtar.|$|E

40|$|The United States has {{experienced}} dramatic increases in both incarceration {{rates and the}} population of insecurely housed or homeless persons since the 1980 s. These marginalized populations have strong overlaps, with many people being poor, minority, and from an urban area. That a relationship between <b>homelessness,</b> housing insecurity, <b>and</b> incarceration exists is clear, but the extent and nature of this relationship is not yet adequately understood. We use longitudinal, administrative data on Michigan parolees released in 2003 to examine returning prisoners' experiences with housing insecurity <b>and</b> <b>homelessness.</b> Our analysis finds relatively low rates of outright homelessness among former prisoners, but very high rates of housing insecurity, much of which is linked to features of community supervision, such as intermediate sanctions, returns to prison, and absconding. We identify risk factors for housing insecurity, including mental illness, substance use, prior incarceration, <b>and</b> <b>homelessness,</b> as well as protective "buffers" against insecurity <b>and</b> <b>homelessness,</b> including earnings <b>and</b> social supports...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impacts of}} the 1996 Housing Act on <b>homelessness</b> policy <b>and</b> practice in England and Wales.

Attention is then given to the principal provisions of the 1996 Act. The {{main body of the}} paper draws on a national survey of, and in-depth interviews with local authority homelessness officers to explore the impact of the 1996 Act on local <b>homelessness</b> policies <b>and</b> practices, on homeless households and {{on the extent to which}} homelessness is regarded as a problem. The paper ends by looking at the changes in dealing with homelessness introduced by the current Labour Government and at the additional measures required for the problem to be tackled effectively...|$|R
40|$|The <b>homelessness,</b> drug <b>and</b> alcohol, {{and mental}} health service systems are {{separate}} service structures in Australia. They have their own unique funding and governance arrangements and work in separate domains. The homelessness service system fits largely within a community services support framework, while drug and alcohol, {{and mental health}} services are embedded within their respective health systems. Despite the fact that the <b>homelessness,</b> drug <b>and</b> alcohol, and mental health service systems are separate, they share many of the same clients and address similar problems among clients. Homelessness services, for example, provide support to clients who also have drug and alcohol, and mental health needs. Therefore, the <b>homelessness,</b> drug <b>and</b> alcohol, and mental health service systems interact. Service integration and effective working relationships between services across the <b>homelessness,</b> drug <b>and</b> alcohol, and mental health systems is, a priori, critical in achieving good outcomes for clients wherever they may be located. Service integration has become a point of policy focus in recent years. Despite the focus on systems and service integration in the present policy environment and among practitioners, there has been no study, as far as we are aware, of the integration of <b>homelessness,</b> drug <b>and</b> alcohol, {{and mental health services}} in Australia that also considers the perspective of clients. This study aims to fill this critical gap in the literature. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to increase our understanding of the extent and ways in which <b>homelessness,</b> drug <b>and</b> alcohol, and mental health services are working together to provide services to clients with particular emphasis on the needs of homeless people. The study also considers the barriers, costs and benefits of service integration and the perceived effectiveness of various integrated service delivery responses. It focuses at both the service level and at the level of the client and addresses the question as to client perceptions of the integration of services and the effectiveness of the services they are receiving...|$|R
