25|$|For many climates, {{water or}} steam HVAC coils can {{be exposed to}} {{freezing}} conditions. Because water expands upon freezing, these somewhat expensive and difficult to replace thin-walled heat exchangers can easily be damaged or destroyed by just one freeze. As such, freeze protection of coils <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>concern</b> of HVAC designers, installers, and operators.|$|E
25|$|Other gaseous {{emissions}} in the flue gas from incinerator furnaces include nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, hydrochloric acid, heavy metals, and fine particles. Of the heavy metals, mercury <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>concern</b> due to its toxicity and high volatility, as essentially all mercury in the municipal waste stream may exit in emissions if not removed by emission controls.|$|E
25|$|Stability <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>concern</b> in RF and {{microwave}} amplifiers. The degree of an amplifier's stability {{can be quantified}} by a so-called stability factor. There are several different stability factors, such as the Stern stability factor and the Linvil stability factor, which specify a condition that must be met for the absolute stability of an amplifier {{in terms of its}} two-port parameters.|$|E

25|$|Laminitis <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>concern</b> in horses {{suffering}} from endotoxemia. Ideally, prophylactic treatment {{should be provided}} to endotoxic horses, which includes the use of NSAIDs, DMSO, icing of the feet, and frog support. Horses are also sometimes administered heparin, which is thought {{to reduce the risk}} of laminitis by decreasing blood coagulability and thus blood clot formation in the capillaries of the foot.|$|E
25|$|Student {{behaviour}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>concern</b> {{for both}} the University administration and Dunedin residents in general. Concerns over student behaviour prompted the University to introduce a Code of Conduct (CoC) which its students must abide by in 2007. The introduction of the CoC was accompanied by {{the establishment of the}} dedicated 'Campus Watch' security force to keep tabs on crime and anti-social behaviour on campus and in the student neighbourhoods nearby. Campus Watch reports directly to the University's Proctor.|$|E

25|$|Ethiopia {{is one of}} {{the eight}} {{fundamental}} and independent centers of origin for cultivated plants in the world. However, deforestation <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>concern</b> for Ethiopia as studies suggest loss of forest contributes to soil erosion, loss of nutrients in the soil, loss of animal habitats, and reduction in biodiversity. At the beginning of the 20th century, around 420,000km2 (or 35%) of Ethiopia's land was covered by trees, but recent research indicates that forest cover is now approximately 11.9% of the area.|$|E
25|$|Temporal {{aliasing}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>concern</b> in {{the sampling}} of {{video and audio}} signals. Music, for instance, may contain high-frequency components that are inaudible to humans. If {{a piece of music}} is sampled at 32000 samples per second (Hz), any frequency components above 16000 Hz (the Nyquist frequency for this sampling rate) will cause aliasing when the music is reproduced by a digital to analog converter (DAC). To prevent this, an anti-aliasing filter is used to remove components above the Nyquist frequency prior to sampling.|$|E
25|$|Customer {{attrition}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>concern</b> for US and Canadian banks, {{because they}} have much higher churn rates than banks in Western Europe. US and Canadian banks with the lowest churn rates have achieved customer turnover rates as low as 12% per year, by using tactics such as free checking accounts, online banking and bill payment, and improved customer service. However, once banks can improve their churn rates by improving customer service, they can reach a point beyond which further customer service will not improve retention; other tactics or approaches need to be explored.|$|E

25|$|Influenza A virus subtype H3N2 is endemic in pigs in China, and {{has been}} {{detected}} in pigs in Vietnam, increasing fears {{of the emergence of}} new variant strains. The dominant strain of annual flu virus in January 2006 was H3N2, which is now resistant to the standard antiviral drugs amantadine and rimantadine. The possibility of H5N1 and H3N2 exchanging genes through reassortment <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>concern.</b> If a reassortment in H5N1 occurs, it might remain an H5N1 subtype, or it could shift subtypes, as H2N2 did when it evolved into the Hong Kong Flu strain of H3N2.|$|E
25|$|The MOSFET is used {{in digital}} {{complementary}} metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) logic, which uses p- and n-channel MOSFETs as building blocks. Overheating <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>concern</b> in integrated circuits since ever more transistors are packed into ever smaller chips. CMOS logic reduces power consumption because no current flows (ideally), and thus no power is consumed, except when the inputs to logic gates are being switched. CMOS accomplishes this current reduction by complementing every nMOSFET with a pMOSFET and connecting both gates and both drains together. A high voltage on the gates will cause the nMOSFET to conduct and the pMOSFET not to conduct and a low voltage on the gates causes the reverse. During the switching time as the voltage goes from one state to another, both MOSFETs will conduct briefly. This arrangement greatly reduces power consumption and heat generation.|$|E
25|$|Pollution <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>concern</b> in Patna. According to the CAG report, tabled in the Bihar Legislative Assembly in April 2015, respirable {{suspended}} particulate matter (RSPM) level (PM-10) in Patna was 355, three-and-a-half {{times higher than the}} prescribed limit of 100 micro-gram per cubic metre, primarily due to high vehicular and industrial emissions and construction activities in the city. In May 2014, a World Health Organization survey declared Patna the second most air polluted city in India, only after Delhi, with the survey calculating the airborne particulate matter in the state capital's ambient air (PM-2.5) to be 149 micro-grams, six times more than the safe limit, which is 25 micro-grams. Severe air pollution in the city has caused a rise in pollution-related respiratory ailments, such as lung cancer, asthma, dysentery and diarrhoea. The dense smog in Patna during winter season results in major air and rail traffic disruptions every year.|$|E

25|$|As {{measured}} in phosphorus, the waste output of 5,000 cows roughly equals a municipality of 70,000 people. In the U.S., dairy operations {{with more than}} 1,000 cows meet the EPA definition of a CAFO (Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation), and are subject to EPA regulations. For example, in the San Joaquin Valley of California a number of dairies have been established on a very large scale. Each dairy consists of several modern milking parlor set-ups operated as a single enterprise. Each milking parlor {{is surrounded by a}} set of 3 or 4 loafing barns housing 1,500 or 2,000 cattle. Some of the larger dairies have planned 10 or more series of loafing barns and milking parlors in this arrangement, so that the total operation may include as many as 15,000 or 20,000 cows. The milking process for these dairies is similar to a smaller dairy with a single milking parlor but repeated several times. The size and concentration of cattle creates major environmental issues associated with manure handling and disposal, which requires substantial areas of cropland (a ratio of 5 or 6 cows to the acre, or several thousand acres for dairies of this size) for manure spreading and dispersion, or several-acre methane digesters. Air pollution from methane gas associated with manure management also <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>concern.</b> As a result, proposals to develop dairies of this size can be controversial and provoke substantial opposition from environmentalists including the Sierra Club and local activists.|$|E
25|$|The {{crevalle jack}} {{is one of}} the most {{abundant}} large carangids in the Atlantic Ocean, with at least two systematic studies placing it within the top five most abundant species of that region, namely lagoons in Nigeria and Chiapas, Mexico. Seasonal movements are known from both the American and African coastlines, with both juveniles and adults appearing to migrate. In North America, young individuals recruited to northern estuaries are known to move to warmer tropical waters at the onset of winter to escape possible hypothermia. At least one hypothermia-driven mass mortality of 200 crevalle jacks has been reported from the Slocum River in Massachusetts, indicating low-temperature mortality <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>concern</b> for north-ranging groups of the species, with temperatures below 9.0°C apparently being lethal to the fish. This applies not only to river dwelling fish, but also to marine migrants which linger too long in the temperate regions during winter. In Nigeria, and presumably other parts of Africa, the species appears to migrate seasonally, possibly to take advantage of prey, with the fish arriving in Nigeria during September to November. The species is more active during the day than the night, with larger catches in fisheries taken during the day, also. The crevalle jack is a schooling species for most of its life, forming moderately large to very large, fast-moving schools. At larger sizes, the fish become more solitary and move to the deeper offshore reefs. Evidence from laboratory studies indicates crevalle jack are able to coordinate their feeding and spawning aggregations over coral reefs based on the release of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) from the reef. DMSP is a naturally occurring chemical produced by marine algae and, to a lesser extent, corals and their symbiotic zooxanthellae. Field studies have also shown the species increases in abundance with increased levels of DMSP over coral reefs.|$|E
500|$|Although {{there are}} no {{pollution}} point sources in the drainage basin, acid rain <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>concern.</b> [...] Acidification has altered {{the ecology of the}} lakes and region; in Lake Jean low pH has decreased the number and quality of insects and plankton {{at the base of the}} food chain. Fish which are acid tolerant are predominant, including fathead minnow, muskellunge, pumpkinseed, walleye, and yellow perch.
