5|$|Myrmecia nigrocincta, {{commonly}} known as the jumper ant or jumping jack, is an ant of the genus Myrmecia. The species was first described by Frederick Smith in 1858. Colonies of this ant are abundant in eastern Australia. Ants of this species are known <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> jump several inches, and they also have a powerful, venomous sting. Rather than foraging on the ground, M. nigrocincta prefer to forage in trees where they are known to pollinate certain flowers.|$|E
5|$|Planarians, a {{subgroup}} of seriates, are famous <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> regenerate if divided by cuts across their bodies. Experiments show that, in fragments {{that do not}} already have a head, a new head grows most quickly on those closest to the original head. This suggests {{the growth of a}} head is controlled by a chemical whose concentration diminishes from head to tail. Many turbellarians clone themselves by transverse or longitudinal division, and others, especially acoels, reproduce by budding.|$|E

5|$|The {{domestic}} cat (Felis silvestris catus or Felis catus) is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal.

5|$|A year later, the US and Ojibwe {{signed the}} Treaty of Fond du Lac {{at a meeting}} at the western edge of Lake Superior. The signatories were listed by band, and Buffalo, {{recorded}} as Peezhickee, signed as the first chief from La Pointe. The treaty, mainly dealing with mineral rights for Ojibwa lands in what is now Michigan, had little immediate effect but foreshadowed future treaties. Buffalo did not speak on the copper issue. He praised the US officials <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> keep their young people under their control; he asked for whiskey to accomplish the same ends among the younger members of his band. When the agent presented him with a silver medal as a symbol of his chieftainship, Buffalo said that his power was based in his clan and reputation, and not from anything received from the U.S. Government.|$|E
5|$|According to Pulitzer Prize winner Jhumpa Lahiri, Narayan's {{short stories}} {{have the same}} {{captivating}} feeling as his novels, with most of them less than ten pages long, and taking about as many minutes to read. She adds that between the title sentence and the end, Narayan provides the reader something novelists struggle to achieve in hundreds more pages: a complete insight {{to the lives of}} his characters. These characteristics and abilities led Lahiri to classify him as belonging to the pantheon of short-story geniuses that include O. Henry, Frank O'Connor and Flannery O'Connor. Lahiri also compares him to Guy de Maupassant <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> compress the narrative without losing the story, and the common themes of middle-class life written with an unyielding and unpitying vision.|$|E

The aircraft have supported ADF operations in Afghanistan, Iraq and other locations in the Middle East, as well as training exercises in Australia and the United States. They have also transported supplies and personnel as part of relief efforts following natural disasters in Australia, Japan, New Zealand and several other countries.

5|$|Compared {{with the}} options {{available}} for treating sexual dysfunction in men (for whom results are concretely observable), those available for women are limited. For example, PDE5 inhibitors, oral medications for treating erectile dysfunction in men, {{have been tested}} <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> increase sexual responses such as arousal and orgasm in women—but no controlled trials {{have been done in}} women with SCI, and trials in other women yielded only inconclusive results. In theory, women's sexual response could be improved using a vacuum device made to draw blood into the clitoris, but few studies on treatments for sexual function in women with SCI have been carried out. There is a particular paucity of information outside the area of reproduction.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes are {{generally}} globular proteins, acting {{alone or in}} larger complexes. The sequence of the amino acids specifies the structure which in turn determines the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Although structure determines function, a novel enzymatic activity cannot yet be predicted from structure alone. Enzyme structures unfold (denature) when heated or exposed to chemical denaturants and this disruption to the structure typically causes a loss of activity. Enzyme denaturation is normally linked to temperatures above a species' normal level; as a result, enzymes from bacteria living in volcanic environments such as hot springs are prized by industrial users <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> function at high temperatures, allowing enzyme-catalysed reactions to be operated {{at a very high}} rate.|$|E

5|$|In Hawaii, the planarian Endeavouria septemlineata {{has been}} used to control the {{imported}} giant African snail Achatina fulica, which was displacing native snails, and Platydemus manokwari, another planarian, {{has been used}} for the same purpose in Philippines, Indonesia, New Guinea and Guam. Although A. fulica has declined sharply in Hawaii, there are doubts about how much E. septemlineata contributed to this. However, P. manokwari is given credit for severely reducing, and in places exterminating, A. fulica – achieving much greater success than most biological pest control programs, which generally aim for a low, stable population of the pest species. The ability of planarians to take different kinds of prey and to resist starvation may account <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> decimate A. fulica. However, these abilities have raised concerns that planarians may themselves become a serious threat to native snails.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{polio vaccine}} (OPV) is an {{attenuated}} vaccine, {{produced by the}} passage of the virus through non-human cells at a sub-physiological temperature, which produces spontaneous mutations in the viral genome. Oral polio vaccines were developed by several groups, one of which was led by Albert Sabin. Other groups, led by Hilary Koprowski and H.R. Cox, developed their own attenuated vaccine strains. In 1958, the National Institutes of Health created a special committee on live polio vaccines. The various vaccines were carefully evaluated <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> induce immunity to polio, while retaining a low incidence of neuropathogenicity in monkeys. Large-scale clinical trials performed in the Soviet Union in late 1950s to early 1960s by Mikhail Chumakov and his colleagues demonstrated safety and high efficacy of the vaccine. Based on these results, the Sabin strains were chosen for worldwide distribution.|$|E

Green is one of the Christmas colors as well, possibly dating back to pre-Christian times, when evergreens were worshiped <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> maintain their color through the winter season. Romans used green holly and evergreen as decorations for their winter solstice celebration called Saturnalia, which eventually evolved into a Christmas celebration.
