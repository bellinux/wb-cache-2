40|$|Background : Stress can {{decrease}} reproduction function through Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal axis. It {{was known}} that Eurycoma longifolia can increase sexual potent and spermatogenesis. The spermatogenesis process affect tubulus seminiferus diametre. Purpose : To prove that dietary Eurycoma longifolia extract can effect tubulus seminiferus diameter at male Balb/c mice with <b>electric</b> <b>shock</b> <b>treatment.</b> Method : This research was an laboratory experimental research with approach Paralel Group Post Test-Only Control Group Design. Samples consist of 24 male Balb/c mice, {{was divided into}} 4 groups. K was control group without treatment. P 1 was group that was just given <b>electric</b> <b>shock</b> <b>treatment.</b> P 2 was group with <b>electric</b> <b>shock</b> <b>treatment</b> and Eurycoma longifolia 5 mg/day. P 3 was group with <b>electric</b> <b>shock</b> <b>treatment</b> and Eurycoma longifolia 10 mg/day. Then the testis of mice was taken to be made pathology anatomy images. The diametre of tubulus seminiferus was measured then compared each groups. Results : Most of the samples in group P 4 died during research, so that {{were not included in}} analyze. Based on this research, it was found that there were no significantly the diametre of tubulus seminiferus between group K with group P 1 (p= 0, 173), as well as between group P 2 with group P 3 (p= 0, 631). The diametre of tubulus seminiferus of group K was lower than P 2 (p= 0, 045), as well as between group K with P 3 (p= 0, 004). Data analyzed showed the diameter of tubulus seminiferus group P 2 was higher than P 1 (p= 0, 016) and group P 3 was higher than P 1 (p= 0, 004). Conclusion : Eurycoma longifolia extract supplementation in 5 mgs and 10 mgs dosage can increase diametre of tubulus seminiferus at male Balb/c mice stress induced with electric footshock [...] Keywords :	 Stress, diametre of tubulus seminiferus, Eurycoma longifolia. ...|$|R

50|$|Cerletti {{first used}} ECT {{in a human}} patient, a {{diagnosed}} schizophrenic with delusions, hallucinations and confusion, in April 1938, in collaboration with Lucio Bini. A series of electroshocks were able to return the patient to a normal state of mind. This experiment indicated that <b>electric</b> <b>shock</b> <b>treatment</b> may hold potential to improve the condition of patients diagnosed with specific diseases. <b>Electric</b> <b>shock</b> <b>treatment</b> quickly replaced insulin and Metrazol as the favourite form of <b>shock</b> <b>treatment,</b> and became the most effective method of controlling troublesome asylum inmates. Thereafter, in the succeeding years, Cerletti and his coworkers experimented with thousands of electroshocks in hundreds of animals and patients, {{and were able to}} determine its usefulness and safety in clinical practice, with several indications, such as in acute schizophrenia, manic-depressive illness, major depression episodes, etc. His work was very influential, and ECT quickly spread out as a therapeutic procedure all over the world. Despite the fact that it does evoke a grand mal seizure marked by a stereotyped succession of events. Cerletti was noted to be the first person to deliver a stress treatment in which the patient did not suffer any discomfort.|$|R
