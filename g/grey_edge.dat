50|$|The garuda, biologically {{known as}} greater {{adjutant}} (Leptoptilos dubius), {{is classified as}} endangered on the IUCN Red List 2004 of threatened species and listed under Schedule IV of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. This huge stork has a naked pink head, a very thick yellow bill and a low-hanging neck pouch. The neck ruff is white. The bird looks like a vulture. Other than the pale <b>grey</b> <b>edge</b> on each wing, {{the rest of the}} greater adjutant's body is dark grey. Juveniles have a narrower bill, thicker down on the head and neck, and entirely dark wings. A Garuda bird measures 145-150 cm (about three feet) in length and four to five feet in height.|$|E
40|$|The {{description}} of reversal graphs given in [1] is incorrect. The following modifications should be made. Give black {{edges of the}} cycle graph G(π) a direction from π(i) to π(i+ 1). For a particular black edge (π(i), π(i + 1)), the tail is π(i) and the head is π(i + 1). Change the definitions of oriented and unoriented cycles of G(π) as follows: A cycle is unoriented if every <b>grey</b> <b>edge</b> in the cycle connects {{the head of a}} black edge to the tail of a black edge. Otherwise a cycle is oriented. Change the definition of the reversal graph R(C) as follows: For each pair of adjacent elements in π that are not connected by a black edge in the cycle graph, introduce an isolated blue vertex 1. For each <b>grey</b> <b>edge</b> g in G(π) introduce a vertex vg. Vertex vg is coloured blue if g is part of a cycle C in C in which g connects the head of a black edge to the tail of a black edge. Otherwise vg is coloured red. (The edges of the graph are defined {{in the same way as}} before.) Change the way that a reversal ρ(u) affects the cycle graph as follows: Let u be a vertex of R(C) that arises from cycle C. If u is blue then after applying ρ(u), do not remove any black or grey edges from the resulting cycle graph. 1 Below we change the cycle graph so that sometimes elements that form an adjacency are still connected by a black edge...|$|E

40|$|Illuminant {{estimation}} {{is a key}} {{step for}} computational color constancy. Instead of using the grey world or <b>grey</b> <b>edge</b> assumptions, we propose in this paper a novel method for illuminant estimation by using the information of grey pixels detected in a given color-biased image. The under-lying hypothesis {{is that most of}} the natural images include some detectable pixels that are at least approximately grey, which can be reliably utilized for illuminant estimation. We first validate our assumption through comprehensive statis-tical evaluation on diverse collection of datasets and then put forward a novel grey pixel detection method based on the illuminant-invariant measure (IIM) in three logarithmic color channels. Then the light source color of a scene can be easily estimated from the detected grey pixels. Experi-mental results on four benchmark datasets (three recorded under single illuminant and one under multiple illuminants) show that the proposed method outperforms most of the state-of-the-art color constancy approaches with the inher-ent merit of low computational cost. 1...|$|E
40|$|Color cast is {{a crucial}} problem for color image processing. White balance has been widely used to {{eliminate}} color cast to improve the image's quality. Most of white balance implementations are based on color constancy hypothesis. A wellknown color constancy hypothesis is given in [1], unifying White Patch [2], Grey World [3], Shades of Grey [4], and <b>Grey</b> <b>Edge</b> [1] assumptions in one expression. However, this general hypothesis works on underwater images not as reliable as on common images. In the color constancy hypothesis for common scenes, the ambient light source is spatial constant. But in underwater scenes, the light suffers from serious attenuation, especially in the red part of the visible spectrum. This attenuation causes spatial variance of the ambient light source, which lets classic color constancy hypothesis fail. In this paper, we propose a novel low-level image feature-based color constancy hypothesis for underwater scenes. Based on this hypothesis, we propose an algorithm, using a distance map to estimate multiple gain factors to remove the color cast...|$|E
40|$|Apparent {{sliding motion}} in the {{so-called}} Ouchi illusion {{has been attributed to}} the global integration of local motion vectors arising from the aperture effect (Fermüller et al, 2000 Vision Research 40 77 – 96; Mather, 2000 Perception 29 721 – 727). In a number of variants of the Ouchi illusion, we here demonstrate that sliding motion will also arise without a directional motion bias from local elements. Specifically, we show that in a disk – annulus pattern made from wiggly lines, sliding motion occurs although the local orientations within the disk and annulus are the same. We then argue that in an array of square-shaped checks, sliding motion originates from the interaction between the explicit orientation of the checks and the implicit orientation of the invisible diagonals. Finally, we demonstrate that a central array of filled black circles surrounded by a <b>grey</b> <b>edge</b> appears to slide relative to a surround of empty circles. We tentatively account for sliding motion in this figure by differences in speed signals, figure – ground segregation and apparent depth due to contrast polarity, edge blur, demarcation by a frame, and difference in shape...|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} is to study how targets can be more faithfully detected in a multi-camera CCTV network system using spectral feature for the detection. The objective of the work is to develop colour constancy (CC) methodology to help maintain the spectral feature of the scene into a constant stable state irrespective of variable illuminations and camera calibration issues. Unlike previous work in the field of target detection, two versions of CC algorithms have been developed {{during the course of this}} work which are capable to maintain colour constancy for every image pixel in the scene: 1) a method termed as Enhanced Luminance Reflectance CC (ELRCC) which consists of a pixel-wise sigmoid function for an adaptive dynamic range compression, 2) Enhanced Target Detection and Recognition Colour Constancy (ETDCC) algorithm which employs a bidirectional pixel-wise non-linear transfer PWNLTF function, a centre-surround luminance enhancement and a <b>Grey</b> <b>Edge</b> white balancing routine. The effectiveness of target detections for all developed CC algorithms have been validated using multi-camera ‘Imagery Library for Intelligent Detection Systems’ (iLIDS), ‘Performance Evaluation of Tracking and Surveillance’ (PETS) and ‘Ground Truth Colour Chart’ (GTCC) datasets. It is shown that the developed CC algorithms have enhanced target detection efficiency by over 175 % compared with that without CC enhancement.

40|$|Color {{constancy}} {{refers to}} stable psychological tendency in perception even the lighting circumstances changed and it {{plays an important}} role in many computer vision applications. Color constancy is the ability to measure the impact of light onto a digital image independent of the color of the light source. Many color constancy algorithms for estimating the color of the light source, are developed so far but all the existing algorithm are based on single light source i. e. they consider that an image is affected by only one light source or single uniform illumination, which is not the case every time, because an image may be affected with more than one illuminations. The illusion of single light source is now violated by multiple sources of light. In this paper, we will discuss a new method which considers that an image is affected by multiple sources of light, without any clue about the color of the light sources. Grid based sampling technique along with <b>Grey</b> <b>Edge</b> algorithm is used to estimate the color of multiple light sources. The use of Bilateral Filter after applying color correction is giving most promising results and it has provided the consistency of this algorithm over different types of images taken from different datasets. Experimental and visual results show that the proposed method achieves much better results than existing methods for color constancy. The qualitative results are tested over some well known parameters i. e. Median Angular Error (MAE), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) etc...|$|E
