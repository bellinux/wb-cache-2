While the utility of interactive editing for rigid body and articulated figure animations is widely recognized, a corresponding approach to deformable bodies has not been technically feasible before.

The estimators are constructed by taking {{the average of the}} individual predicted survival curves. The method of <b>direct</b> <b>adjustment</b> controls for possible confounders due to an imbalance of patient characteristics between treatment groups. This adjustment is especially useful for non-randomized studies. We have written a SAS Macro to estimate and compare the direct adjusted survival curves.

40|$|An {{aggregate}} series can be {{seasonally adjusted}} {{either directly or}} indirectly by adjusting its components and adding the results, or dividing in the case of ratios. The results will rarely be identical. To preserve additivity, it is often preferred to indirectly adjust many series. However, in some instances this may lead to an adjustment with residual seasonality, large revisions, or less stable results than direct seasonal adjustment. To test these possibilities, I directly adjust the 392 national Current Population Survey (CPS) series (that are currently indirectly adjusted) with X- 13 A-S and summarize the results. Key diagnostics for comparison include the spectrum and revisions. Further discussion deals with cases where a <b>direct</b> <b>adjustment</b> might be more appropriate than indirect adjustment. 1...|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the accuracy of}} intraoperative computed tomography (iCT) in localizing deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes by comparing this modality with postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Optimal lead placement is a critical factor for the outcome of DBS procedures and preferably confirmed during surgery. iCT offers 3 -dimensional verification of both microelectrode and lead location during DBS surgery. However, accurate electrode representation on iCT has not been extensively studied. DBS surgery was performed using the Leksell stereotactic G frame. Stereotactic coordinates of 52 DBS leads were determined on both iCT and postoperative MRI and compared with intended final target coordinates. The resulting absolute differences in X (medial-lateral), Y (anterior-posterior), and Z (dorsal-ventral) coordinates (ΔX, ΔY, and ΔZ) for both modalities were then {{used to calculate the}} euclidean distance.

40|$|Background: Long term video-electroencephalography {{monitoring}} (VEM) {{has been}} wide-ly {{used for the}} diagnosis, classification, and management of seizures. Few studies have systemically examined its safety issues and clinical utility. This prospective study investigates the general clinical application of long term VEM {{in the management of}} paroxysmal events. Methods: This study cohort consisted of patients admitted to the inpatient VEM unit at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (Lin-Kou). Standard 19 channel scalp elec-troencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), and simultaneous video images were recorded continuously for 2 full days. Patient characteris-tics, and clinical, video-EEG and safety data were obtained and analyzed. The diagnosis and management of paroxysmal events before VEM were compared with those after VEM. Results: Habitual events were recorded in 54. 3 % of the 129 patients, and VEM had a yield rate of 76 % (events recorded or newly recorded interictal discharges) in determining the nature of the events. Eleven patients had seizure clusters, but there was no status epilepticus or electrode-related injury. After VEM, the diagnostic categories were changed in 41. 1 % of the patients, and 40. 3 % had revisions in management.
