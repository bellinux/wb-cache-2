2500|$|Various transformations were {{effected}} for {{the relatives}} of the Corsini pope in the Palazzo Riario alla Lungara, which had been modified for Christina, queen of Sweden in the previous century but became now the Palazzo Corsini alla Lungara, purchased on 27 July 1736 by Don Neri and Don Bartolomeo Corsini, for 70 thousand scudi from [...] Duke Riario. [...] After Christina's death in 1689, her sculpture gallery and her library were emptied. Fuga {{was called in to}} pull together the 15th and 16th-century amenagements for the Corsini brothers, works which took from 1736 to 1758 before all was finally completed. The Corsini retained Christina's bedroom just as she had left it, and the [...] "urban" [...] front in piazza Fiammetta had to be left untouched, but the weight of her library had produced cracks in the vaulting below it, and repairs to the existing structure were not finished until 1738 (Holste). Fuga worked on the garden front of the palazzo, beginning with work on the library wing for Neri Corsini. In 1751-53 he added an identical central block containing a theatrical divided staircase, lit with large windows that looked onto the garden parterres, which had been modified and brought up to date in 1741. Then the two were linked with a ground-floor portico. In the interiors, fuga managed in innovative ways to maintain a separation of the <b>functional</b> <b>service</b> circulation from the suites of parade rooms.|$|E

50|$|On 30 March 1987, {{the module}} Kvant-1 was launched; {{it was the}} second module of the space station Mir, and would add 40 m3 of {{pressurized}} volume to Mir, bringing the total to about 130 m3. Attached to Kvant-1 was a <b>Functional</b> <b>Service</b> Module (FSM), which contained propellants, and was used to direct the module to Mir. At launch, the Kvant module had a mass of 11 tonnes, and the FSM had a mass of 9.6 tonnes. At the time, this was the heaviest payload to be launched by a Proton rocket. The automatic docking system was unable to dock the module completely with Mir on the first attempt. On April 5, the crew of EO-2 retreated to their lifeboat, Soyuz TM-2, in case the module lost control.|$|E

There was a street in the east-west direction which passed on the south side of the villa with peristyle and the granary located 150 metres from it. From this street it was possible to approach these buildings. The central area was occupied by the villa with its open peristyle, nymphaeum and thermae; to the west of the villa was the granary, and somewhat to the north a spacious building with octagonal and circular rooms. To the south of the villa are the remains of several villas and <b>functional</b> <b>service</b> structures. What strikes the eye is that the luxurious buildings of solid material with columns, decorated with marble facing, mosaics and frescoes, are concentrated mainly around the central villa and its peristyle, while the economic buildings are located to the west of the granary towards Naissus.|$|E

This study aims to identify the perceived value dimensions as functional and relational value to investigate the relationship between each dimension of perceived value with the future intention and also to examine the commitment as a mediator role between multi dimensions of perceived value and future intention. Factor analysis indicated six dimensions of perceived value as <b>functional</b> <b>service</b> quality, <b>functional</b> <b>service</b> price, <b>functional</b> <b>service</b> value, relational confidence and relational communication. Step wise regressions analysis further observed that <b>functional</b> <b>service</b> value, <b>functional</b> <b>service</b> quality, relational confidence and relational communications are the better predictors to the future intention. Among these dimensions, relational confidence is fully mediated by the commitment, and leads to future intention.
