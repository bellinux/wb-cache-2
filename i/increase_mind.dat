Study 1 demonstrates that animals considered appropriate for human consumption are ascribed diminished mental capacities.

30|$|We do {{not claim}} that {{prospection}} {{is by definition}} stimulus-unrelated as around 30 % of prospective thoughts were triggered by the stimulus content. This finding aligns with previous studies that have shown that cueing a person’s current concerns, for instance by asking {{them to make a}} to-do list (Kopp et al., 2015 a) or read words that are related to the current concerns (McVay & Kane, 2013) can <b>increase</b> <b>mind</b> wandering. Examples from our data support this conclusion – we observed that “the passage [..] continuously talking about math” can trigger thoughts about “my math test at 11 : 20,” and seeing the letters “AB carved in the brick wall” can lead to “thinking about plans for the weekend” with a “friend [whose] initials are AB.” The current study suggests that stimulus processing can give rise to prospection if its content is related to the person’s concurrent goals. This also resonates with findings from the prospective memory literature, which suggest that cues that are related to a prospective memory (e.g. an unfulfilled task) may reflexively trigger spontaneous retrieval of that task or goal (McDaniel et al., 2004; Scullin, McDaniel, Shelton, & Lee, 2010).|$|E

Recent advances {{in the study of}} consciousness using a mind-wandering paradigm permit a rigorous examination of the effects of alcohol on experiential consciousness and metaconsciousness. Fifty-four male social drinkers consumed alcohol (0. 82 g/kg) or a placebo beverage and then performed a mind-wandering reading task. This task indexed both self-caught and probe-caught zone-outs to distinguish between mind wandering inside and outside of awareness. Compared with participants who drank the placebo, those who drank alcohol {{were significantly more likely to}} report that they were zoning out when probed. After this <b>increase</b> in <b>mind</b> wandering was accounted for, alcohol also lowered the probability of catching oneself zoning out. The results suggest that alcohol <b>increases</b> <b>mind</b> wandering while simultaneously reducing the likelihood of noticing one's mind wandering. Findings are discussed with regard to theories of alcohol and theories of consciousness...|$|R

30|$|<b>Increased</b> <b>mind</b> {{wandering}} {{and paying}} more attention to one’s own thoughts, emotions, and experiences have been related with low levels of self-esteem (Mrazek, et al. 2013). Nevertheless, {{paying more attention}} to oneself is not necessarily considered a negative activity for self-esteem. So mindfulness is considered a construct that contrasts with mind wandering (Mrazek, Smallwood, and Schooler, 2012 b). The mindfulness construct has been defined in many forms, and all its definitions coincide in that {{it is a matter of}} paying intentionally more attention to the present time and not taking a judgemental attitude about experience (Brown and Ryan, 2003; Germer, 2005; Kabat-Zinn, 1990; Segal, Williams and Teasdale, 2002). This non-judgemental attitude makes mindfulness appear positively related with self-esteem (Kong, Wang, and Zhao, 2014; Rasmussen and Pidgeon, 2011). In turn, self-esteem is considered a predictor of satisfaction with life (Diener and Diener, 1995; Mäkikangas and Kinnunen, 2003). Hence, the aforementioned factors may be considered modulators in the relation between mind wandering and satisfaction with life.|$|R
40|$|Social {{media and}} mobile {{technology}} now provide consumers {{with the opportunity}} to continuously document or reflect on their moment-to-moment internal and external experiences. For instance, "tweets" are often written while one is consuming some experience, just as other forms of social media may be used in their respective ways for documentation or reflection while an experience is unfolding. But what effect does verbal documentation or reflection have on consumers' enjoyment of their time? The authors propose that when consumers can verbally document or reflect about topics other than the current experience, increased mind wandering can occur, which can help lead to reduced enjoyment. Testing the theoretical model through five experiments, the authors show that verbal documentation or reflection during an experience can reduce enjoyment, regardless of whether that experience is generally enjoyable or generally unenjoyable. However, the same effect does not occur when consumers are specifically asked to verbally document or reflect only about the experience they are taking part in. Verbal documentation or reflection right after an experience ends, which does not <b>increase</b> <b>mind</b> wandering during the experience, can lead to increased enjoyment when consumers are specifically asked to verbally document or reflect only about the experience they just took part in. Implications for the use of social media for verbal documentation and reflection by consumers and marketing managers are discussed. Dissertatio...|$|E
40|$|Ascribing mental {{states to}} {{non-human}} agents {{has been shown}} to increase their likeability and lead to better joint-task performance in human-robot interaction (HRI). However, it is currently unclear what physical features non-human agents need to possess in order to trigger mind attribution and whether different aspects of having a mind (e. g., feeling pain, being able to move) need different levels of human-likeness before they are readily ascribed to non-human agents. The current study addresses this issue by modeling how increasing the degree of human-like appearance (on a spectrum from mechanistic to humanoid to human) changes the likelihood by which mind is attributed towards non-human agents. We also test whether different internal states (e. g., being hungry, being alive) need different degrees of humanness before they are ascribed to non-human agents. The results suggest that the relationship between physical appearance {{and the degree to which}} mind is attributed to non-human agents is best described as a two-linear model with no change in mind attribution on the spectrum from mechanistic to humanoid robot, but a significant increase in mind attribution as soon as human features are included in the image. There seems to be a qualitative difference in the perception of mindful versus mindless agents given that increasing human-like appearance alone does not <b>increase</b> <b>mind</b> attribution until a certain threshold is reached, that is: agents need to be classified as having a mind first before the addition of more human-like features significantly increases the degree to which mind is attributed to that agent...|$|E

40|$|Type 1 {{diabetes}} {{is a serious}} chronic autoimmune disease that pervasively imposes itself into sufferers' lives without respite. While insulin is a treatment that aids to sustain life for those with the disease, {{it is not a}} cure, indeed presently, there is no cure. The direct and indirect physiological impact of type 1 {{diabetes is}} significant, degenerative, and ultimately {{for the vast majority of}} sufferers, life shortening. These include both acute and chronic complications that require a substantial and unceasing investment in self-care energies in order to prevent, monitor, and manage the multitude of ramifications they proffer. Additionally, the disease confers a significantly increased risk for psychopathology and neuropsychopathology. Anxiety, depression, and cognitive impairment across multiple domains, all have an increased prevalence in individuals with type 1 diabetes. There are a number of hypotheses as to why <b>increased</b> <b>mind</b> and brain disorders prevail that include factors relating to environmental, psychosocial and neurophysiological pathogenic mechanisms. While the specifics remain unclear, there is consensus that the biopsychosocial complexity of type 1 diabetes means that the pathogenic mechanisms underlying <b>increased</b> <b>mind</b> and brain comorbidities in the disease are likely to be heterogeneous and evanescent. This thesis presents a series of eleven studies that evaluate and describe the interrelationships between type 1 diabetes and a number of biopsychosocial characteristics, and their consequences. Psychosocial, psychological, cognitive, and immunoregulatory phenomena are explored throughout the thesis. A number of findings are presented across the eleven studies however, perhaps the most significant finding is that affective disorders (anxiety, depression, and comorbid anxiety-depression) are pervasively prevalent in children and adults with type 1 diabetes, and that the relationship between disordered affect and other psychosocial factors long considered ubiquitous such as increased stress and poor coping skills, differ in the disease compared to those without the condition. Moreover, the influence of affective disorders was shown to be pervasive, impacting cognitive function and inflammatory characteristics in type 1 diabetes to a far greater extent than no-type 1 diabetes controls. The influence of affective disorders was also shown to mediate the risk of diabetes-specific clinical factors such as metabolic control and complications. Ultimately, this thesis illustrates that psychopathological phenomena are a serious issue in type 1 diabetes that present a tangible impediment to general and diabetes-specific health and wellbeing. A far greater clinical investment is required to address this issue, and more research is needed to better understand the pathogenic mechanisms involved, and the consequences they produce...|$|R
40|$|Literature Review: Background: There is {{increasing}} theoretical {{interest in the}} idea that a greater tendency for the mind to wander may reduce positive emotion experience, with specific interest in clinical conditions such as depression that are characterised by reduced pleasure experience (anhedonia). However, it is unclear to what degree these claims are empirically supported. Objective: A systematic review was conducted to examine the evidence regarding the association between mind wandering and positive emotion experience. Method: The Cochrane library, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Web of Knowledge databases were searched. A narrative discussion considered both the pattern of findings and the methodological approaches utilised in this literature. Results: 879 studies were identified and 21 relevant papers were fully reviewed, consisting of cross-sectional, prospective and manipulation studies. Conclusions: Fourteen out of 15 cross-sectional studies supported the claim that <b>increased</b> <b>mind</b> wandering was related to decreased pleasure experience. One prospective study indicated that mind wandering generally preceded but was not subsequent to reductions in positive mood. There were six studies that manipulated mind wandering experimentally, four of which found that inducing greater mind wandering led to reduced positive affect and two of which found null results. Overall, this literature supports the claim that greater mind wandering is related to reduced positive affect. However, very few studies examined this relationship in the context of depression and therefore it remains to be established if these findings generalise to clinical populations. Empiricial Paper: Previous research has established that greater levels of mind wandering are associated with reduced positive affect (PA) in the general population. The present study aims to examine whether this mechanism may mediate the relationship between depression and reduced PA (anhedonia). A community sample (N = 69) with differing levels of depression severity took part. Using experience sampling methodology, we measured mind wandering and PA during everyday life and when completing a few scheduled positive activities. To examine if mind wandering specifically influenced PA or emotion experience more generally, we additionally measured levels of negative affect (NA). Across both contexts, both greater mind wandering and greater depression severity were independently associated with reduced PA and increased NA. Greater depression severity was associated with <b>increasing</b> levels of <b>mind</b> wandering in everyday life, but not during scheduled positive activities. Mind wandering did not mediate the link between depression and reduced PA/increased NA. Exploratory analyses did however reveal that a greater tendency for the mind wander to negative rather than positive themes did mediate the link between depression and reduced PA in everyday life. We replicated previous findings that <b>increased</b> <b>mind</b> wandering is related to reduced PA and increased NA but {{there was no evidence that}} this mediated the relationship between depression and altered affective experience. However, the greater tendency for the mind to wander to negative themes may mediate the link between depression and affect.

40|$|Mind wandering—mentation {{unrelated}} to one’s current activity and surroundings—is a ubiquitous phenomenon, but seemingly competing ideas {{have been proposed}} regarding its relation to executive cognitive processes. The control-failure hypothesis postulates that executive processes prevent mind wandering, whereas the global availability hypothesis proposes that mind wandering requires executive resources, and thus an excess of such resources enables mind wandering. Here, we examined whether these hypotheses could be reconciled by considering the moderating influence of daydreaming style. We expected that executive resources would be positively related to mind wandering in those who typically experience positive mind wandering mentation, but negatively related in those who typically experience negative mentation. One hundred eleven participants reported mind wandering over 4 days using experience sampling and completed the sustained attention to response task (SART), the symmetry span task, and the Stroop task. There was a significant interaction between working memory and negative, but not positive, daydreaming style on mind wandering: Working memory related positively to mind wandering in those with a low negative style, but negatively in those with a high negative style. In contrast, poor Stroop performance significantly predicted <b>increased</b> <b>mind</b> wandering, but only in those with a low positive style. SART responses did not predict mind wandering although the relation was suggestively enhanced as the difficulty of daily life activities increased, indicating that the SART is more generalizable to high-demanding than low-demanding activities.

This <b>increase</b> in <b>mind</b> blanking happened at the expense of both focused and wandering thoughts. We also found that methylphenidate reverted the level of mind blanking to baseline (i. e. the level of mind blanking reported by control children without ADHD).
