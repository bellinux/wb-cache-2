5|$|Almost 90% {{of ethnic}} Vietnamese are {{stateless}} residents of Cambodia, {{and do not}} carry citizenship papers such as identity cards or birth certificates. The 1996 Cambodian law on nationality technically permits Vietnamese residents born in Cambodia to take up citizenship, but faced resistance from mid-ranking <b>interior</b> <b>ministry</b> officials who generally refrain from registering Vietnamese residents due to concerns of political implications from opposition parties if citizenship were to be granted. A minority of Vietnamese residents were able to obtain citizenship only after paying bribes to <b>interior</b> <b>ministry</b> officials, or were married to Khmer spouses. The minority of Vietnamese residents who hold citizenship reported of <b>interior</b> <b>ministry</b> officials confiscating their citizenship papers. As a result, the Vietnamese faced legal restrictions from getting access to public healthcare, education, employment and buying land for housing as the majority do not carry Cambodian citizenship. Stateless Vietnamese built floating settlements in-lieu of buying land-based dwellings which require citizenship papers. According to field research carried out by Cambodia's Minority Rights Organisation, <b>interior</b> <b>ministry</b> officials would confront Vietnamese fishermen in the Tonle Sap and demand bribes {{in order to allow}} them to carry out fishing.|$|E
5|$|On 25 February 2014, former First Prime Minister of Cambodia Norodom Ranariddh, who {{was ousted}} from FUNCINPEC in 2006, {{announced}} {{plans to return to}} politics and lead the formation the Community of Royalist People's Party. The Cambodian <b>Interior</b> <b>Ministry</b> reportedly received a request from the party to be formally registered as a political party. In March 2014, Ranariddh hosted the party's official launching ceremony at the Phnom Penh Sunway Hotel, where he revealed the party logo and signed registration papers for the party. In April 2014, the CRPP's registration was officially approved by the <b>Interior</b> <b>Ministry.</b> A month later, CRPP appointed a new chief-of-cabinet Nop Sothearith, and the party also made an in-advance registration with the <b>Interior</b> <b>Ministry</b> to run for general elections scheduled to be held in 2018. In June 2014, the CRPP held a party to mark its official launch, and opened its headquarters at the Russey Keo District in Phnom Penh.|$|E
5|$|Ordnungspolizei ("Order Police"; Orpo) was {{the uniformed}} police force in Nazi Germany. Created in 1936 by the <b>interior</b> <b>ministry,</b> it was {{responsible}} for law enforcement throughout Germany.

5|$|When Naguib began {{showing signs}} of {{independence}} from Nasser by distancing himself from the RCC's land reform decrees and drawing closer to Egypt's established political forces, namely the Wafd and the Brotherhood, Nasser resolved to depose him.

5|$|In August 2012, the Egyptian Armed Forces {{undertook}} a large-scale military operation {{to regain control}} of the Sinai Peninsula from armed militants. Air cover throughout the operation was provided by the Egyptian Air Force's Apache helicopters; reportedly the Apaches destroyed three vehicles and killed at least 20 militants. Up to five Egyptian Apaches were temporarily stationed in the Sinai following an agreement between Egypt and Israel. In September 2015, an Egyptian Apache attacked a group of foreign tourists in the Western Desert, killing 12 people and injuring 10, they were mistaken for Islamist militants, the Egyptian <b>Interior</b> <b>Ministry</b> stated that the group were in a restricted area.|$|E

5|$|Over the {{following}} months, the population radicalized itself, and, on September 18, 1848, {{just one week}} before the Revolution was crushed, crowds entered the <b>Interior</b> <b>Ministry,</b> taking over the official copies of Regulamentul Organic and the register of boyar ranks (Arhondologia). The documents were subsequently paraded through the city in a mock funeral cortege, and burned down, one sheet at a time, {{in the public square}} on Mitropoliei Hill. Neofit reluctantly agreed to preside over the ceremony and to issue a curse on both pieces of legislation.|$|E
5|$|The clash {{began after}} rebel Serbs seized the town's {{police station and}} {{municipal}} building and harassed Croatian government officials. The Croatian government carried out a counterstrike against the rebels, sending <b>Interior</b> <b>Ministry</b> special police to re-establish control. Fighting broke out between the two sides. Despite an attempted intervention by the Yugoslav National Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA), the Croatian government reasserted its control over the town. After a standoff with the JNA, an agreement {{to pull out the}} special police and the JNA was reached, restoring the town to conditions before the Serb attempt to seize control of the police there.|$|E
5|$|This attack, {{and similar}} attacks {{carried out by}} the GAL, became a major issue during the 1996 Spanish general {{election}} after a Supreme court trial established that the Spanish <b>Interior</b> <b>Ministry</b> had provided clandestine funding for the GAL. Spanish Interior Minister José Barrionuevo and his security chief, Rafael Vera, were jailed for ten years for sanctioning a kidnapping and misappropriation of public funds to finance the group, and the GAL scandal is seen as a key factor in the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) losing the election, though more senior figures in the PSOE, such as Felipe Gonzalez, denied knowledge and involvement.|$|E

5|$|Although the United States {{remained}} officially neutral until April 1917, it {{was increasingly}} throwing its {{support to the}} Allies through trade. To counter this, German ambassador Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff and <b>Interior</b> <b>Ministry</b> official Heinrich Albert were tasked with undermining American industry and maintaining public support for Germany. One of their agents was a former Bayer employee, Hugo Schweitzer. Schweitzer set up a contract for a front company called the Chemical Exchange Association to buy all of Edison's excess phenol. Much of the phenol {{would go to the}} German-owned Chemische Fabrik von Heyden's American subsidiary; Heyden was the supplier of Bayer's salicylic acid for aspirin manufacture. By July 1915, Edison's plants were selling about three tons of phenol per day to Schweitzer; Heyden's salicylic acid production was soon back on line, and in turn Bayer's aspirin plant was running as well.|$|E
5|$|At about 04:30 on June 30, 1934, Hitler and {{his entourage}} flew into Munich. From the airport they drove to the Bavarian <b>Interior</b> <b>Ministry,</b> where they {{assembled}} the leaders of an SA rampage {{that had taken place}} in city streets the night before. Enraged, Hitler tore the epaulets off the shirt of Obergruppenführer August Schneidhuber, the chief of the Munich police, for failing to keep order in the city on the previous night. Hitler shouted at Schneidhuber and accused him of treachery. Schneidhuber was executed later that day. As the stormtroopers were hustled off to prison, Hitler assembled a large group of SS and regular police, and departed for the Hanselbauer Hotel in Bad Wiessee, where Ernst Röhm and his followers were staying.|$|E
5|$|During {{his short}} time in office, Rodríguez Saá {{announced}} {{the creation of}} a new currency, the argentino, which would have circulated alongside the peso and the dollar. The civil unrest of previous days resurfaced when he announced his cabinet, as it included Carlos Grosso as Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers. Grosso was a very unpopular former mayor of Buenos Aires. As a result, Rodríguez Saá gave up his whole cabinet before they could take office, with the sole exception of Rodolfo Gabrielli, in the <b>Interior</b> <b>Ministry.</b> He also declared a sovereign default on the Argentine national debt, which was celebrated by the chamber of deputies. It was the highest sovereign default in history. Those measures, uncharacteristic of an interim president with a brief term of office, were rescented by the leaders of the Justicialist party.|$|E

5|$|For {{the most}} part, Germans {{accepted}} the Nuremberg Laws, partly because Nazi propaganda had successfully swayed public opinion towards the general belief that Jews were a separate race, {{but also because}} to oppose the regime meant leaving oneself open to harassment or arrest by the Gestapo. Citizens were relieved that the antisemitic violence ceased after the laws were passed. Non-Jews gradually stopped socialising with Jews or shopping in Jewish-owned stores. Wholesalers who continued to serve Jewish merchants were marched through the streets with placards around their necks proclaiming them as traitors. The Communist party and some elements of the Catholic Church were critical of the laws. Concerned that international opinion would be adversely swayed by the new laws, the <b>Interior</b> <b>Ministry</b> did not actively enforce them until after the 1936 Summer Olympics, held in Berlin that August.|$|E
5|$|Forecasters and {{computer}} models at the Miami-based National Hurricane Center predicted that Hurricane Dean would impact the Yucatán Peninsula a full 6days {{before the storm}} actually arrived.

5|$|In July 2015, FUNCINPEC {{announced}} {{the formation of}} the Cambodian Royalist Youth Movement, a youth organisation aimed at garnering electoral support for the party from younger voters. Meanwhile, tension persisted between Nhek Bun Chhay and Ranariddh, which erupted into a public spat, as Ranariddh threatened to expelled Nhek Bun Chhay who in turn, accused the party president of holding a grudge against him. Subsequently, on 3 February 2016, Nhek Bun Chhay announced that he was quitting the party, and went on to form his new party, the Khmer National United Party (KNUP). The KNUP adopted a logo which was similar to a former logo of FUNCINPEC, featuring the Cambodian Independence Monument. The secretary-general, Say Hak accepted Nhek Bun Chhay's resignation, {{while at the same time}} challenged KNUP's use of its new logo as he lodged a successful complaint with the <b>interior</b> <b>ministry.</b>|$|E

WannaCrypt demanded US$300 per computer.

5|$|Ranariddh met {{his first}} wife, Eng Marie in early 1968.

The couple separated, and Marie filed for divorce in March 2006 when Ranariddh's relationship with Ouk Phalla became known. The divorce was not finalised until June 2010. Ranariddh has two sons with Ouk Phalla: Sothearidh (born 2003), and Ranavong (born 2011). Phalla is a descendant of King Sisowath and was a classical dancer.

5|$|The <b>Interior</b> <b>Ministry</b> {{estimated}} {{there were}} 750,000 Mischlinge as of April 1935 (studies done {{after the war}} put the number of Mischlinge at around 200,000). As Jews {{became more and more}} excluded from German society, they organised social events, schools, and activities of their own. Economic problems were not so easily solved, however; many Jewish firms went out of business due to lack of customers. This was part of the ongoing Aryanization process (the transfer of Jewish firms to non-Jewish owners, usually at prices far below market value) that the regime had initiated in 1933, which intensified after the Nuremberg Laws were passed. Former middle-class or wealthy business owners were forced to take employment in menial jobs to support their families, and many were unable to find work at all.|$|E
