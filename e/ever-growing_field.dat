The molecules {{are found to}} assemble in an upright position as a complete monolayer within 60 min. The overall structure of the SAM reaches equilibrium within 24 h as evidenced by infrared spectroscopy, although a slight improvement in water contact angles is observed {{over a period of}} a few weeks. The resulting SAM is 60 Å thick and it displays an advancing water contact angle of 112 ° and excellent electrochemical blocking characteristics with typical current densities about 20 times lower as compared to those observed for HS(CH 2) 15 CH 3 SAMs. The dominating crystalline phases of the supporting HS(CH 2) 15 and terminal (CH 2) 15 CH 3 alkyl portions, as well as the sealed oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) “core,” appear as unusually sharp features in the infrared spectra at room temperature. For example, the splitting seen for the CH 3 stretching and CH 2 scissoring peaks is normally only observed for conformationally trapped alkylthiolate SAMs at low temperatures and for highly crystalline polymethylenes. Temperature-programmed infrared spectroscopy in ultrahigh vacuum reveals a significantly improved thermal stability of the SAM under investigation, as compared to two analogous OEG derivatives without the extended alkyl chain. Our study points out the advantages of adopting a “modular approach” in designing novel SAM-forming compounds with precisely positioned in plane stabilizing groups. We demonstrate also the potential of using the above set of compounds in the fabrication of “hydrogel-like” arrays with controlled wetting properties for application in the <b>ever-growing</b> <b>fields</b> of protein and cell analysis, as well as for bioanalytical applications.|$|R

However, knowledge of RNA-binding antibodies and their application in the <b>ever-growing</b> RNA <b>field</b> is lacking. Here {{we have developed}} a robust approach using a synthetic phage-display library to select specific antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) targeting a large functional RNA. We have solved the crystal structure of the first Fab–RNA complex at 1. 95 Å. Capability in phasing and crystal contact formation suggests that the Fab provides a potentially valuable crystal chaperone for RNA. The crystal structure reveals that the Fab achieves specific RNA binding on a shallow surface with complementarity-determining region (CDR) sequence diversity, length variability, and main-chain conformational plasticity. The Fab–RNA interface also differs significantly from Fab–protein interfaces in amino acid composition and light-chain participation. These findings yield valuable insights for engineering of Fabs as RNA-binding modules and facilitate further development of Fabs as possible therapeutic drugs and biochemical tools to explore RNA biology...|$|R

40|$|The sorting of used {{plastics}} is an <b>ever-growing</b> market <b>field</b> {{which is}} further pushed by new EU regulations in, e. g., car recycling. Modern recycling techniques require pure or almost pure fractions of polymers. These pure fractions {{can be generated}} from waste using modern sorting technologies based on specific mechanical, electrical and chemical material properties such as density, conductivity and melting point. The thermal recycling of plastics is no longer seasonable. More modern recycling techniques require pure fractions containing only a single variety of polymer. A {{large portion of the}} plastic waste contains black or multilayer materials that are not sortable with todays' sorting technologies. To overcome this challenge, three Fraunhofer institutes are working together to develop a new type of sorting system. As a first step, we have developed a frequency domain line-scan camera working in the terahertz range with frequencies below 300 GHz. Since the entropy in terahertz signals below 300 GHz is not as high as needed for simple classification, more complex statistical pattern recognition methods are needed. The application of those methods to the problem of sorting black plastics as the second step in this joint project is presented in this paper. These methods have to be integrated into a real sorting system, which is the third part of our joint project. The modular approach gives the ability to integrate our sensors and algorithms into existing sorting systems...|$|R

40|$|Corporate finance is a large, <b>ever-growing,</b> and ever-changing <b>field.</b> Consequently, it is {{virtually}} impossible to organize corporate finance into clear or widely agreed upon categories that can be studied independently or sequentially. Nonetheless, a number of “literatures ” have developed within corporate finance to help with this classification. This classification may not result in the most elegant or even the clearest organization. However, from a practical standpoint, it is useful to think about corporate finance in terms of the various literatures because working in any of these literatures necessitates a deep understanding of the related research. As an example, consider corporate dividend policy, a change to which will necessarily impact a firm’s capital structure. However, research on capital structure and dividend policy has developed largely independent of one another. While there are always exceptions to be found in studies “bridging ” literatures, the simple fact is that when you write a capital structure paper, your target audience consists primarily of those people who work on capital structure and you are much more likely to get a referee who works on capital structure than on dividend policy. Therefore, understanding the relevant capita...|$|R
