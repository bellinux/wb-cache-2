5|$|The sole {{content of}} Article III is the {{statement}} regarding separation of powers. The three branches (executive, judicial, and legislative) are created and defined. No individual can be affiliated {{with more than}} one unless the Constitution explicitly allows it.

5|$|At a {{referendum}} held on January 14, 1895, 46 of 53 voters approved incorporation as a Borough. Citizens of Englewood Township challenged {{the creation of}} a borough, but accepted the new municipality as a township, given its more rural character. A bill supporting the creation of the Township of Teaneck was put through the New Jersey General Assembly on February 18, 1895, and the New Jersey Senate on the next day. <b>Governor</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> George Werts signed the bill into law, and Teaneck was an independent municipality.|$|E

5|$|The Ineligibility Clause has {{interfered}} with appointments {{as far back}} as 1793. President George Washington attempted to appoint William Paterson to the Supreme Court on February 27, 1793, after the resignation of Associate Justice Thomas Johnson. However, Paterson, who was serving as <b>Governor</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey,</b> had previously been elected to serve a Senate term that would expire at noon on March 4, 1793. Washington withdrew the nomination and withheld it until the afternoon of March 4, when the term for the disqualifying office had expired.|$|E
5|$|The Lieutenant <b>Governor</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> is {{an elected}} {{constitutional}} {{officer in the}} executive branch of the state government of New Jersey in the United States. The lieutenant governor is the second highest-ranking official in the state government and is elected concurrently on a ticket with the governor for a four-year term. Because the position itself does not carry any powers or duties other than to be next in the order of succession, the state constitution requires that the lieutenant governor be appointed to serve as the head of a cabinet-level department or administrative agency within the governor's administration.|$|E

5|$|The {{campaign}} for the post of <b>Governor</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> was successful with 54% of the vote. Forrester, a businessman and a former Mayor of West Windsor Township, in Mercer County, won 43%. Corzine received 1,224,493 votes to Forrester's 985,235. A total of 80,277 votes, or 3%, were scattered among other candidates. Corzine won 13 of New Jersey's 21 counties: Atlantic, Bergen, Burlington, Camden, Cumberland, Essex, Gloucester, Hudson, Mercer, Middlesex, Passaic, Salem, and Union. Corzine won the three most populous counties (Bergen, Essex, and Middlesex), five of the top six, and seven of the top nine.|$|E
5|$|Following Whitman's {{resignation}} and DiFrancesco's departure, John O. Bennett served as acting governor {{for three and}} a half days. During that time, he signed a few bills into law, gave a State of the State Address, and held parties at Drumthwacket, the New Jersey governor's mansion. Similarly, Richard J. Codey served as acting governor as well. Because control of the New Jersey State Senate was split, resulting in two Senate co-presidents, Codey and Bennett, each held the office of acting governor for three days. Perhaps this spectacle as much as any other factor led to the voters' decision to amend the state constitution to create the office of Lieutenant <b>Governor</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1877, McClellan was {{nominated}} by the Democrats for <b>Governor</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey,</b> {{an action that}} took him by surprise because he had not {{expressed an interest in}} the position. He accepted the nomination, was elected, and served a single term from 1878 to 1881, a tenure marked by careful, conservative executive management and minimal political rancor. The concluding chapter of his political career was his strong support in 1884 for the election of Grover Cleveland. He sought the position of secretary of war in Cleveland's cabinet, for which he was well qualified, but political rivals from New Jersey were able to block his nomination.|$|E

Three represented Washington Territory as delegates to the U.S. House, and one additionally represented Idaho Territory in the same fashion, as well as serving as Governor of Idaho Territory. Two territorial governors represented eastern states, one as a representative from, and <b>governor</b> <b>of,</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey,</b> and one represented Virginia both in the United States and Confederate Houses. Three governors represented {{the state in the}} U.S. Senate, and two represented the state in the House. One governor has served in the United States Cabinet.

5|$|The Port Authority is jointly {{controlled}} by the governors of New York and New Jersey, who appoint {{the members of the}} agency's Board of Commissioners and retain the right to veto the actions of the Commissioners from his or her own state.

An Executive Director is appointed by the Board of Commissioners to deal with day-to-day operations and to execute the Port Authority's policies.

5|$|Michigans keel {{was laid}} down on 17 December 1906, {{one day before}} South Carolina.

Michigan was {{slightly more than half}} complete when launched, and the ship was christened by Carol Newberry, the daughter of Assistant Secretary of the Navy Truman Handy Newberry. The warship was billed as epoch-making, and the spectacle drew many prominent individuals, including the governor and lieutenant-governor of Michigan, the <b>governor</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey,</b> the mayor of Detroit, and the secretary of the Interior Department, along with many naval admirals and constructors. Like its sister ship, South Carolina was just over halfway completed when it was launched. The accompanying ceremony took place just after noon and was attended by many notable residents of the state of South Carolina, including Governor Martin Frederick Ansel. His daughter Frederica christened the ship.|$|E

5|$|Prior to 2010, {{unlike most}} other states, New Jersey {{did not have}} the office of {{lieutenant}} governor. Until 2010, when the office of governor was vacant or the governor was unable to fulfill his/her duties through injury, the President of the State Senate served as the acting governor. The Senate President continued in the legislative role during his/her tenure as the state's acting chief executive, thus giving the person control over executive and legislative authority. The acting governor served either until the next general election, until the governor recovered from his/her injuries, or, if the governor died or resigned less than 16 months before end of the term, {{until the end of the}} term. Richard Codey served as acting <b>governor</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> until January 2006, following the resignation of Jim McGreevey in late 2004. Following the resignation of Christine Todd Whitman in 2001 to become EPA Administrator, Donald DiFrancesco assumed the acting governor's post. The position of lieutenant governor was created in the 2005 state election effective with the 2009 election.|$|E
5|$|The keel for New Jersey {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Fore River Shipyard on 3 May 1902.

She was commissioned into the US fleet on 12 May 1906, Captain William Kimball in command.

On 21 September, the ship was deployed to Cuba {{to take part in the}} Second Occupation of Cuba; she remained there until 13 October. New Jersey participated in the Jamestown Exposition from 15 April to 14 May 1907, which commemorated the 300th anniversary of the founding of the Jamestown colony. An international fleet that included British, French, German, Japanese, and Austro-Hungarian warships joined the US Navy at the event.|$|E

The law was retroactive to January 1, 2001; it therefore changed the titles of Donald DiFrancesco and Richard Codey, affecting Jim McGreevey's numbering.
