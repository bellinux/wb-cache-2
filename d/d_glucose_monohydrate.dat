Two positive control diets were formed by substituting either 16. 5 % dehulled soybean meal or a mixture containing amounts of essential amino acids equivalent {{to those in the}} added dehulled soybean meal in place of an equal amount of <b>glucose</b> <b>monohydrate</b> in the basal diet. Nine additional diets were formed by removing one or more amino acids from the mixture. Each of the 12 diets in a block design was fed to two pens of males and two pens of females with 8 birds per pen from 7 to 19 days of age in each experiment. Average body weight gain of poults fed the 22 % protein diet with added amino acids approached that of poults fed the 30 % protein diet (288 vs. 300 g, respectively). Removal of the amino acid mixture from the 22 % protein diet depressed body weight gain by 19. 0 %. Depressions of 19, 16, 11, 7, and 6 % in body weight gains resulted from the removal of valine, threonine, lysine, phenylalanine (or tyrosine or glycine), and isoleucine, respectively. A decrease of 5 % was required for significance (P=£. 05).

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effects of aging on small intestinal regulation of appetite, GI hormone release, and gastric myoelectrical activity. METHODS: Thirteen older (65 - 84 yr) and 13 young (18 - 32 yr) healthy men received isovolumetric, intraduodenal (i. d.) infusions of saline (control), lipid, and glucose for 120 min, on separate days. The energy content of the lipid and glucose infusions was identical at 2. 86 kcal/min. Immediately after the i. d. infusions, each subject was offered a buffet meal, and ad libitum food intake was quantified. Blood glucose and plasma insulin, glucagon-like peptide 1, and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide were measured. Gastric myoelectrical activity was measured by surface electrogastrography (EGG). RESULTS: I. d. lipid suppressed food intake in both the young and older men (p < 0. 05), whereas i. <b>d.</b> <b>glucose</b> suppressed food intake only in the older men (p < 0. 05). The blood glucose (p < 0. 01) and insulin (p < 0. 05) responses to i. <b>d.</b> <b>glucose</b> were greater in older than young men. However, there were no differences in glucagon-like peptide 1 or glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide responses to any of the infusions.

Intermediate levels of liver fat were obtained with wheat and similar liver fat contents were observed with hens fed different samples of West Coast wheat. There {{was no significant difference}} in liver fat of groups fed wheat diets made isocaloric with corn oil or animal fat.

40|$|This thesis studies THz {{frequency}} imaging {{using different}} electrically tunable THz QCLs as the source. The THz QCL {{is based on}} a three-well resonant phonon active region design and uses a single metal waveguide. Using a heterogeneous cascade scheme, obtained by changing the growth rate of Ga during epitaxial process, the thickness of the GaAs is reduced progressively by 10 % throughout the active region. As a result, the emission frequency can be varied from 3. 05 to 3. 35 THz by switching the bias of the QCL. Two types of imaging system are demonstrated. First, dual frequency imaging is demonstrated by electrically tuning the QCL bias, and a transmission image of the high explosive PETN and other polycrystalline samples (i. e. lactose <b>monohydrate,</b> <b>glucose</b> <b>monohydrate,</b> and sucrose) at frequencies of 3. 05 THz and 3. 24 THz are obtained in a single raster scan of a sample. By taking the difference of the natural logarithms of the transmission, coefficients obtained at each frequency, difference- attenuation-coefficient images for the samples can be obtained. The difference- intensity imaging may also be found directly by combining amplitude modulation of the QCL bias, and hence output frequency, with lock-in detection. Owing to their unique molecular-specific absorption spectra, the samples measured could be readily distinguished using this methodology. Second, multi-frequency imaging is demonstrated by electrically tuning a heterogeneous active region QCL at five different biases, producing five different output frequencies. Using a scanning resolution target, the imaging system {{has been shown to be}} independent of the radiation wavelength, which has been explained through measurement of the far-field emission profile of the QCL.

40|$|Vegetal {{waste and}} some {{wastewater}} of agro-food industries contain plant secondary metabolites (PSMs). It was showed in nutritional researches that these substances such as saponins and tannins reduced the methane {{production in the}} rumen. To our knowledge no study {{was done in the}} waste treatment domain to evaluate the inhibitory effect of the principal glycosidic metabolites from the wastewater or vegetal waste on their own methane-producing anaerobic digestion. Therefore in this paper BMP tests were carried out at 30 °C with four commercial PSMs (CPSMs) in mixture with <b>glucose</b> <b>monohydrate</b> (Gl) used as control sample. These CPSMs were saponin from Quilaja Saponaria Molina Pract (Sap), tannic acid (Tan), salicin (Sal) and aloin from Curacao Aloe (Alo) representing respectively saponins, tannins, alcoholic glycosides and anthraquinones sources. Acidogenesis and acetogenesis were recorded for all the mixtures of Gl and CPSMs; however their conversion rates decreased with the increase of the concentrations of CPSMs. By contrast, the methanogenesis was inhibited at concentrations of CPSMs above 0. 3 g/l. The inhibition degree for aromatic compounds on the anaerobic biodegradation of Gl seemed directly to depend on the numbers of benzene rings in the medium and the synergism. Thus, the highest inhibition of the biogas production from Gl was recorded for Alo, followed by Sap, Tan and Sal. However, the highest inhibition of the methane production from Gl was recorded with Sap, Alo, Tan and Sal. It was supposed that the toxicity potentials of these PSMs on the own biomethanization would be in following decreasing order: Sap or Alo, Tan and Sal. Therefore, the concentration of PSMs alone or in mixture in a digester should be bellow 0. 3 g/l. for a better methanization. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Chlorella pyrenoidosa 7 - 11 - 05 was selected for fermentation studies because of its high level of xanthophylls and wide temperature range for growth. The heterotrophic metabolism was preferred because of the ease of adaptability to present fermentation equipment. When used as the sole carbon source, glucose was the only sugar, among many tested, that gave appreciable growth in illuminated shaken flasks. A dry cell weight of 90 g per liter and total xanthophylls of 450 mg per liter were obtained from 190 g per liter of <b>glucose</b> <b>monohydrate</b> in 168 -hr illuminated shaken flasks. Higher levels of glucose decreased yields. In combination with glucose, monosaccharides, such as fructose and galactose, were readily assimilated. The 7 - 11 - 05 strain was adapted to galactose as the sole carbon source after six vegetative passages. Light of the proper intensity and duration stimulated total xanthophylls approximately 35 %. The effect on dry cell weight and total xanthophylls of seven antibiotics added at various levels in shaken flasks was studied. Erythromycin was essentially stable throughout the fermentation and nontoxic up to 25 μg/ml, with only slight toxicity at higher levels.

To determine the role of these factors in the mediation of glucagon suppression, we injected alloxan while clamping the arterial supply of the pancreatic splenic lobe of dogs, thus inducing insulin deficiency localized to the ventral lobe and avoiding hyperglycemia. Ventral lobe insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin outputs were then measured {{in response to a}} stepped IV glucose infusion. In control dogs glucagon suppression occurred at a glucose level of 150 mg/dl and somatostatin output increased at glucose greater than 250 mg/dl. In alloxan-treated dogs glucagon output was not suppressed nor did somatostatin output increase. We concluded that insulin was required in the mediation of glucagon suppression and somatostatin stimulation. Subsequently, we infused insulin at high rates directly into the artery that supplied the beta cell-deficient lobe in six alloxan-treated dogs. Insulin infusion alone did not cause suppression of glucagon or stimulation of somatostatin; however, insulin repletion during glucose infusions did restore the ability of hyperglycemia to suppress glucagon and stimulate somatostatin. We conclude that intra-islet insulin permits glucose to suppress glucagon secretion and stimulate somatostatin during hyperglycemia...|$|R
30|$|The BMP assays {{of leaves}} (MU or MI) were {{determined}} following the procedure described by Rodriguez et al. (2005) and Wang et al. (1994). The tests {{were carried out}} in duplicate in 250 ml sterile glass serum bottles filled with 150 ml of a mixture. This mixture consisted of 125 ml of phosphate – carbonate buffer solution (with the pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH 5 N), 25 ml of anaerobic sludge inoculum and milled leaves. Leaves grounded at 1 mm size were used for tests with 250 mg, 1000 mg, 2000 mg dry weight and shredded leaves at 2 cm size {{were used for the}} more concentrated test with 9200 mg raw matter. It is to note that the sludge was collected from a 20 liters stirred anaerobic digester used in Walloon Center of Industrial Biology for BMP assays of different agro-food organic wastes. This lab-scale digester was inoculated two years ago with a sludge collected from a full-scale anaerobic digester treating the activated sludge from a municipal waste water treatment plant. The minerals elements and vitamins were not added in the sample bottles considering that those substances should be present in the leaves. Each positive control sample consisted of 0.5 g of <b>glucose</b> <b>monohydrate</b> (Gl) alimented in two times (0.25 g at the beginning and 0.25 g after the 100 th day, by adding 2 ml of a 125 g/l aqueous solution by syringe injection through the septum) and 25 ml of inoculum in a 250 ml sterile glass serum bottle containing 125 ml of phosphate – carbonate buffer solution. It is to note that 2 ml of the same Gl aqueous solution that the previous, was also added in the samples of MI leaves after the 100 th day of the same manner that in positive control samples. This Gl addition was a test to discover the reasons of the methanogenesis inhibition. Each blank sample consisted of 25 ml of the anaerobic sludge inoculum and 125 ml of phosphate – carbonate buffer solution. No energetic substrate was added to the blank samples.|$|R
40|$|The {{addition}} of oligofructose as a dietary fiber decreases the serum concentration and the hepatic release of VLDL-triglycerides in rats. Because glucose, insulin, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and gut peptides [i. e., glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) ]) are factors {{involved in the}} metabolic response to nutrients, this paper analyzes their putative role in the hypolipidemic effect of oligofructose. Male Wistar rats were fed a nonpurified diet with or without 10 % oligofructose for 30 <b>d.</b> <b>Glucose,</b> insulin, IGF-I and GIP concentrations were measured in the serum of rats after eating. GIP and GLP- 1 contents were also assayed in small intestine and cecal extracts, respectively. A glucose tolerance test was performed in food-deprived rats. Serum insulin level was significantly lower in oligofructose-fed rats both after eating and in the glucose tolerance test, whereas glycemia was lower only in the postprandial state. IGF-I serum level did not differ between groups. GIP concentration was significantly higher in the serum of oligofructose-fed rats. The GLP- 1 cecal pool was also significantly higher. In this study, we have shown that cecal proliferation induced by oligofructose leads {{to an increase in}} GLP- 1 concentration. This latter incretin could be involved in the maintenance of glycemia despite a lower insulinemia in the glucose tolerance test in oligofructose-fed rats. We discuss also the role of hormonal changes in the antilipogenic effect of oligofructose...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} whether the uptake and metabolic partition of glucose are influenced by its delivery route, 12 normal volunteers underwent two 3 -h euglycemic (approximately 93 mg/dl) hyperinsulinemic (approximately 43 mU/l) clamps at a 3 - to 5 -wk interval, one with intravenous (i. v.) {{and the other with}} intraduodenal (i. <b>d.)</b> <b>glucose</b> labeled with [3 - 3 H]- and [U- 14 C]glucose. Systemic glucose was traced with [6, 6 - 2 H 2]glucose in eight subjects. During the last hour of the clamps, the average glucose infusion rate (5. 85 +/- 0. 37 vs. 5. 43 +/- 0. 43 mg. kg(- 1). min(- 1); P = 0. 02) and exogenous glucose uptake (5. 66 +/- 0. 37 vs. 5. 26 +/- 0. 41 mg. kg(- 1). min(- 1); P = 0. 04) were borderline higher in the i. d. than in the i. v. studies. The increased uptake was entirely accounted for by increased glycolysis (3 H 2 O production), which was attributed to the stimulation of gut metabolism by the absorptive process. No difference was observed in glucose storage whether it was calculated as glucose uptake minus glycolysis (i. d. vs. i. v. : 2. 44 +/- 0. 28 vs. 2. 40 +/- 0. 31 mg. kg(- 1). min(- 1)) or as glucose uptake minus net glucose oxidation (2. 86 +/- 0. 33 vs. 2. 81 +/- 0. 35 mg. kg(- 1). min(- 1)). Because peripheral tissues were exposed to identical glucose, insulin, and free fatty acid levels under the two experimental conditions, we assumed that their glucose uptake and storage were similar during the two tests. We therefore suggest that hepatic glycogen storage (estimated as whole body minus peripheral storage) was also unaffected by the route of glucose delivery. On the other hand, in the i. <b>d.</b> tests, the <b>glucose</b> splanchnic extraction ratio calculated by the dual-isotope technique averaged 4. 9 +/- 2. 3 %, which is close to the figures published for i. v. glucose. Despite the limitations related to whole body measurements, these two sets of data do not support the idea that enteral glucose stimulates hepatic uptake more efficiently than i. v. glucose...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} shown that {{tungstate}} is an effective hypoglycemic agent in several animal models of diabetes. In this study, we examined the effectiveness of oral tungstate treatment in a new experimental diabetic syndrome, induced by streptozotocin (STZ) and nicotinamide in adult rats, that shares several features with human type 2 diabetes. Sodium tungstate was administered in the drinking water (2 mg/mL) of control and diabetic rats for 15, 30, 60, and 90 <b>d.</b> <b>Glucose</b> metabolism was explored in vivo by intravenous glucose tolerance test. Insulin secretion and action were assessed in vitro in the isolated perfused pancreas and isolated adipocytes, respectively. Two weeks of tungstate treatment did not modify the moderate hyperglycemia of diabetic rats but reduced their intolerance to glucose, owing to an enhancement of postloading insulin secretion. However, this effect was transient, since it declined after 30 d and vanished after 60 and 90 d of tungstate administration, whereas a trend toward a reduction in basal hyperglycemia was observed on prolonged treatment. Oral tungstate was unable to modify glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in the isolated perfused pancreas, as well as muscle glycogen levels, hepatic glucose metabolism, and insulin-stimulated lipogenesis in isolated adipocytes. Nevertheless, the decreased insulin content of pancreatic islets of diabetic rats was partially restored on prolonged tungstate treatment. In conclusion, in the STZ-nicotinamide model of diabetes, tungstate was unable to permanently correct the alterations in glucose metabolism, despite some indirect evidence of a trophic effect on beta-cells. The ineffectiveness of tungstate could be related to the absence, in this diabetic syndrome, of relevant metabolic alterations in the liver, which thus appear to constitute the major target of tungstate actio...|$|R
40|$|The hyperglucagonemia {{that occurs}} in vivo in animals made {{diabetic}} with alloxan or streptozotocin is not suppressed by high glucose but is suppressed by exogenous insulin. These observations together with other studies suggested that insulin-dependent glucose transport and metabolism by the alpha-cells serves as the primary mechanism controlling glucagon secretion. This hypothesis was tested in the present investigation. The possible interactions between glucose, insulin, and a mixture of 20 amino acids at physiological proportions were examined in the isolated-perfusin diabetic rats. Release of insulin and glucagon were used as indicators of theta-cell and alpha-cell function. According to rigid criteria the diabetic animals entering the study were severely diabetic. It was found that in vitro: (a) basal glucagon release (measured {{in the absence of}} an alpha-cell stimulus or inhibitor) was extremely low, even lower (i. e. 10 %) than the basal rates seen in controls; (b) the alpha-cells of alloxanized- and streptozotocin-treated rats responded with a biphasic glucagon release to stimulation by an amino acid mixture; (c) this alpha-cell response was reduced after both streptozotocin and alloxan; (<b>d)</b> <b>glucose</b> at 5 mM was a potent inhibitor of amino acid-induced glucagon secretion in both types of experimental diabetes; (e) in alloxan diabetes alpha-cell stimulation by amino acids can be curbed by exogenous insulin, whereas glucagon secretion by the perfused pancreas of streptoxotocin diabetic rats appeared to be resistant to insulin action. The data indicate that the modulation of glucagon secretion by glucose in vitro is indipendent of insulin and that other unknown factors extrinsic to the pancreatic islets are responsible for the hyperglucagonemia observed in vivo...|$|R

Six Nili-Ravi buffalo bulls maintained at a semen production unit, Peshawar were randomly divided into two equal groups (control and treatment); Both groups were fed a basal diet of maize fodder (15 Kg/day/bull) and wheat straw (6 Kg/day/bull). Bulls in the control group received 5 kg /day/head of a commercial concentrate while the treatment group was fed 3 Kg commercial concentrate and 1 Kg UDP supplement. Both supplements were iso-nitrogenous and provided 150 g nitrogen /head/day. The diets were fed in a switch over design over two periods. Each period lasted for 32 days. One-week adaptation period was allowed at the start of each experimental period. In~sacco protein degradability at 12 hours incubation for commercial concentrate and UDP supplement was 72. 87 and 43. 46 %, respectively.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} insulin gene therapy using a glucose-responsive synthetic promoter in type 2 diabetic obese mice. METHODS: We employed a recently developed novel insulin gene therapy strategy using a synthetic promoter that regulates insulin gene expression in the liver in response to blood glucose level changes. We intravenously administered a recombinant adenovirus expressing furin-cleavable rat insulin {{under the control of}} the synthetic promoter (rAd-SP-rINSfur) into diabetic Leprdb/db mice. A recombinant adenovirus expressing &#x 3 B 2;-galactosidase under the cytomegalovirus promoter was used as a control (rAd-CMV-&#x 3 B 2;gal). Blood glucose levels and body weights were monitored for 50 <b>d.</b> <b>Glucose</b> and insulin tolerance tests were performed. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to investigate islet morphology and insulin content. RESULTS: Administration of rAd-SP-rINSfur lowered blood glucose levels and normoglycemia was maintained for 50 d, whereas the rAd-CMV-&#x 3 B 2;gal control virus-injected mice remained hyperglycemic. Glucose tolerance tests showed that rAd-SP-rINSfur-treated mice cleared exogenous glucose from the blood more efficiently than control virus-injected mice at 4 wk [area under the curve (AUC) : 21 &#x 2005;&#x 2005; 508. 80 1; 2248. 18 vs 62 &#x 2005;&#x 2005; 640. 00 1; 5014. 28, P < 0. 01] and at 6 wk (AUC: 29 &#x 2005;&#x 2005; 956. 60 1; 1757. 33 vs 60 &#x 2005;&#x 2005; 016. 60 1; 3794. 47, P < 0. 01). In addition, insulin sensitivity was also significantly improved in mice treated with rAd-SP-rINSfur compared with rAd-CMV-&#x 3 B 2;gal-treated mice (AUC: 9150. 17 1; 1007. 78 vs 11 &#x 2005;&#x 2005; 994. 20 1; 474. 40, P < 0. 05). The islets from rAd-SP-rINSfur-injected mice appeared to be smaller and to contain a higher concentration of insulin than those from rAd-CMV-&#x 3 B 2;gal-injected mice.
