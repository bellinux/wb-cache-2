5|$|In a {{scene in}} the episode, Homer and Bart <b>exit</b> <b>the</b> Magic Palace's gift shop, only {{to end up in}} another gift shop.

The ending scene of the episode went through several changes and was as a result completed late in the episode's production. The writers had conceived the courtroom scene, but they were stuck {{trying to come up with}} an ending after Skinner had been shot. They eventually decided that the trial was a scam staged by the townspeople, and Simpsons writer George Meyer pitched the surfing scene that closed the episode.|$|E

Roy and Sgt Don Randall used scaling ladders and grenades to accomplish the former, and a head-on rush to secure the bridge and form a bridgehead that enabled Capt.

5|$|GoldenEye 007 is a first-person shooter that {{features}} both single and multiplayer modes. In the single-player mode, the player takes {{the role of}} James Bond {{through a series of}} free-roaming 3D levels.

40|$|Abstract. Safety {{evacuation}} {{design is}} a key content for building fire safety design. In this paper, we apply the CAFE model to conduct an one-exit room simulation. And then we establish the regression equation of exit flow rate considering the factors of <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> width, <b>the</b> size of the room, the location of <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> and <b>the</b> pedestrian density. So as to find the effect of <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> location on <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> flow rate, we analyze the correlation of the two variables. It is found that <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> flow rate of large room is easily affected by <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> location. And it proves that <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> flow rate decreases {{with the increase of}} <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> location. At last we study the probability distribution of the number of pedestrians evacuating through <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> and list some reasons why <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> flow rate decreases with <b>the</b> increasing <b>exit</b> width...|$|R
