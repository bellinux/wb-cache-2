They are to be put on board <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> <b>tonight.</b> They are fast camels and, as the {{distance}} from the point where we shall land to the Atbara will not be more than seventy or eighty miles, we shall be able to do it in a day." ...|$|E
5000|$|Lorin Dixon scored [...] "only" [...] four points, yet her {{performance}} earned her accolades from sports writers and coaches. Jeré Longman of The New York Times wrote, [...] "on Sunday, Dixon {{had the biggest}} impact". Dixon's coach, Geno Auriemma said, [...] "What Lorin did <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>tonight</b> was unbelievably important." ...|$|E
5000|$|Following a 12th-place finish, Truex {{said that}} it was [...] "a little disappointing where we ended up. We {{definitely}} didn’t come in here saying we’d be OK with fourth. We tried our best, but it just wasn’t in the cards <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>tonight.</b> It’s frustrating to have a day like this because everything was on the line.” ...|$|E
6000|$|Then he left them, {{and when}} they were again alone, Aquareine said, [...] "We were able to escape Zog's attacks today, but I am quite sure he will plan more {{powerful}} ways to destroy us. He has shown that he knows some clever magic, and perhaps I shall not be able to foil it. So it will be well <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to escape <b>tonight</b> if possible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now you {{had better}} help Larry picket your horses. Put them {{by the side of}} mine. See how the troopers fasten theirs, and do yours the same. When that is done, send Larry to get hold of some wood, and light a fire. It will be cold when the sun goes down. As for food, we have brought enough with <b>us</b> <b>for</b> <b>tonight.</b> Tomorrow, I suppose, we shall get rations." ...|$|R

Davon Lawrence who had expanded roles in the game also added “The offensive line did a great job of blocking <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>tonight.</b> They opened up a lot of holes tonight” while Iowa transfer Marcus Coker {{commented on the}} performance of the team adding [...] "Our running attack is good. We have a lot of good running backs on this team. Jamie and Davon were exciting to watch." ...|$|E
50|$|I am here tonight, {{because as}} a war correspondent, I {{was part of the}} allied {{airborne}} operation that for a brief moment in history, more than fifty years ago, focused the world's attention on this crossing of the Rhine and this Dutch City of Arnhem. I speak tonight from hallowed ground, for here more than 1500 brave British parachutists died in a futile attempt to gain the bridge. 6000 were captured, many of them wounded. They represent <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>tonight,</b> the millions of others, soldiers, sailors, airmen and civilians, claimed in history’s worst calamity. In a war whose long delayed ending, this concert commemorates and celebrates. In May 1944 the European continent had been a major battleground for almost four years. The country's provinces, cities and more importantly the people of Europe were devastated by the toll of mankind’s Second World War. Beginning just 50 kilometers upstream from this City of Arnhem, stretched the heartland of the aggressor's war industry. While the sounds of the factories were of course too far off to be heard from here, life was dominated by the ominous sound of a not so distant thunder.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, I will go ashore now, Joe, if {{you will}} let me have the boat. The captain {{is going to have}} supper with <b>us,</b> <b>tonight.</b> I wanted you to come too, but he said you could not both come on shore, together. I hope we shall see you tomorrow." ...|$|R

"Roger," [...] he said presently, [...] "you {{must leave}} <b>us,</b> <b>tonight.</b> Those of my {{followers}} who have escaped will soon {{make their way}} back, and my authority {{will be unable to}} save you.

If they go beyond the forest in the daytime they usually wait until the dawn of another day before they return, as they fear to pass through the country of the black lions after dark.

50|$|Some things don’t change. The clubhouse endures, as does Stroudy, both outliving {{expectations}} and having seen better days. Nobody can play forever and inevitably bodies, wives or selectors tell us it’s time to bin those boots. And {{that we are}} better players in retirement than in reality. And {{that you are a}} long time retired. These things are as incontrovertible as a Chris Lewis match cancellation. But the real constant <b>for</b> <b>us</b> all is our love and commitment to rugby, the game that brings <b>us</b> together <b>tonight,</b> that has given us so many memorable moments, and where we make friendships that will last for a lifetime. Have a wonderful evening.|$|R

40|$|Halloween is upon <b>us</b> <b>tonight</b> and it’s {{all just}} a bit of {{harmless}} fun, right? Or is there truly a dark side to Halloween? What should we make of kids getting together in groups, wearing costumes that hide their identity, and going from house to house asking for treats at the threat of a “trick”? One dark Halloween night many years ago, some researchers decided to find out by hiding in houses throughout suburban Chicago, in the United States, and observing the behaviour of 1, 039 children who were trick-or-treating by themselves or with other children (but not with adults). The aim was to see if the children’s behaviour would be influenced by anonymity and/or the behaviour of the other children they were with (if they were in a group) ...|$|R

In 1999 President Clinton awarded Bentsen the Presidential Medal of Freedom, {{one of the}} nation's highest honors given to civilians.

40|$|This {{symposium}} {{is concerned}} with the possible effects of peace between the two parts of Ireland on the economies of both and on the island of Ireland as a whole. It goes without saying that the greatest and overwhelming dividend of peace is the ending of loss of life and human misery, especially in NI. The question before <b>us</b> <b>tonight</b> is the secondary one of whether there is likely to be an economic bonus flowing from the peace and what form it might take. Any attempt to answer this question must be speculative at best - for a number of reasons. First, there are no analogues in recent history to guide us. The ending of the Cold War and the Re-unification of Germany, for example, could hardly be taken as even approximate models. Second, the results of any "positive shock" are difficult to predict and, in this instance the difficulties are compounded by attitudinal factors, weak economic links and by data deficiencies...|$|R
