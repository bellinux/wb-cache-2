5|$|As the Brazilian {{army was}} ready for combat, Caxias sought to {{encircle}} Humaitá and force its capitulation by siege. To aid the operation, he used observation balloons to gather information of the enemy lines. The combined Brazilian–Argentine–Uruguayan army advanced through hostile territory to surround Humaitá. By 2 November, Humaitá was completely cut off from land reinforcement by Paraguayan forces. On 19 February 1868, Brazilian ironclads successfully made a passage up the Paraguay River under heavy fire, gaining <b>full</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the river and isolating Humaitá from resupply by water.|$|E
5|$|Back on Earth, O'Neill and Teal'c {{penetrate}} the submarine and find {{and destroy the}} original Replicator. When the other Replicators take <b>full</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the submarine, O'Neill orders the forces outside to destroy the submarine and prepares for the end, but Thor beams the team onto his ship before the explosion occurs. With the imminent Replicator threat over, Thor promises that when the Asgard defeat the Replicators, he will come to assist Earth {{in the war against}} the Goa'uld.|$|E
5|$|Campaigns for {{regional}} autonomy for the North have seen little electoral support. Plans by Labour under Tony Blair to create devolved regional assemblies {{for the three}} Northern regions were abandoned after the government lost the 2004 North East England devolution referendum against a No vote of 78%. The regionalist Yorkshire Party and North East Party only hold seats at the parish and town council level, and the Northern Party, which campaigned for a devolved Northern government {{with the power to}} make laws and <b>full</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> taxation and spending, was wound up in 2016.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Pacific War in August 1945, SWPA was {{dissolved}} and the Air Board again assumed <b>full</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> all its operational formations. Nos.1 and 2(Training) Groups, and No.5 (Maintenance) Group, were disbanded between January and March 1946. Northern Command, {{having been}} re-designated Northern Area in December 1945, was disbanded in February 1947. The other area commands continued to function with essentially the same boundaries as during the war, except that North-Western Area no longer covered the Dutch East Indies.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the native}} Egyptian rulers {{installed}} by Esarhaddon {{were unable to}} retain <b>full</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the whole country for long. Two years later, Taharqa returned from Nubia and seized control of a section of southern Egypt {{as far north as}} Memphis. Esarhaddon prepared to return to Egypt and once more eject Taharqa; however, he fell ill and died in his capital, Nineveh, before he left Assyria. His successor, Ashurbanipal, sent an Assyrian general named Sha-Nabu-shu with a small, but well trained army, which conclusively defeated Taharqa at Memphis and once more drove him from Egypt. Taharqa died in Nubia two years later.|$|E
5|$|In July 2007, Hong Kong {{businessman}} Carson Yeung, via the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (SEHK)-listed company Grandtop International Holdings Limited (GIH), bought 29.9% of the plc {{from its}} directors. Although {{his intention to}} take <b>full</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the club initially came to nothing.

The Austro-Hungarians left Belgrade on 14 and 15 December and retreated back into Austria-Hungary under the cover of their river monitors on the Sava and the Danube. The Serbian Army re-entered Belgrade on 15 December and was in <b>full</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the city {{by the end of the}} following day.|$|E
5|$|Owing {{to a lack}} of {{confidence}} in the local currency, the US dollar is widely accepted as a medium of exchange alongside the Somali shilling. Dollarization notwithstanding, the large issuance of the Somali shilling has increasingly fueled price hikes, especially for low value transactions. This inflationary environment, however, is expected {{to come to an end}} as soon as the Central Bank assumes <b>full</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> monetary policy and replaces the presently circulating currency introduced by the private sector.|$|E
50|$|Jones co-directed Monty Python and the Holy Grail with Terry Gilliam, and was sole {{director}} on two further Monty Python movies, Life of Brian and Monty Python's The Meaning of Life. As a film director, Jones finally gained <b>fuller</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> {{the projects}} and devised a visual style that complemented the humour. His later films include Erik the Viking (1989) and The Wind in the Willows (1996). In 2008, Jones {{wrote and directed}} an opera titled Evil Machines. In 2011, he was commissioned to direct and write the libretto for another opera, entitled The Doctor's Tale.|$|R

With most credentials battles settled in McKinley's favor, {{the roll of}} delegates drawn up by the RNC heavily favored the Ohioan, though Reed, Allison, Morton and Quay remained in the race. The credentials report served as a test vote, which the McKinley forces won easily. Hanna, who was a delegate from Ohio, was in <b>full</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the convention.|$|E
5|$|The Fourth Crusade {{resulted}} in the disruption of Byzantine manufacturing and the commercial dominance of the Western Europeans in the eastern Mediterranean, events that amounted to an economic catastrophe for the Empire. The Palaiologoi tried to revive the economy, but the late Byzantine state would not gain <b>full</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> either the foreign or domestic economic forces. Gradually, it also lost its influence on the modalities of trade and the price mechanisms, and its control over the outflow of precious metals and, according to some scholars, even over the minting of coins.|$|E
5|$|The {{campus was}} devastated by {{a fire in}} 1912, which deepened the school's grave {{financial}} difficulties. In 1916, the state government took <b>full</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the school and renamed it Maryland State College. Byrd became the assistant athletic director in 1918 and assisted in the consolidation with the professional colleges in Baltimore, {{which resulted in the}} creation of the University of Maryland. During this time, the team was referred as 'The Old Liners', most likely in reference to the state nickname.|$|E

5|$|The {{facility}} grew {{considerably in}} {{size in the}} post-independence period after successive renovation projects. With {{the outbreak of the}} civil war in the early 1990s, Mogadishu International Airport's flight services experienced routine disruptions and its grounds and equipment were largely destroyed. In the late 2000s, the K50 Airport, situated 50 kilometers to the south, served as the capital's main airport while Mogadishu International Airport, now renamed Aden Adde International Airport, briefly shut down. However, in late 2010, the security situation in Mogadishu had significantly improved, with the federal government eventually managing to assume <b>full</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the city by August 2011.|$|E
5|$|The {{transitional}} period was subsequently extended by a year. On 15 January 1998, the UNTAES mandate ended and Croatia regained <b>full</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the area. As the UNTAES replaced the UNCRO mission, Prevlaka peninsula, previously under UNCRO control, was put under control of United Nations Mission of Observers in Prevlaka (UNMOP). The UNMOP {{was established by}} United Nations Security Council Resolution 1038 of 15 January 1996, and terminated on 15 December 2002.|$|E
5|$|After Inhaúma had punched {{through the}} {{defenses}} at Curupayty, he encountered three large chains {{stretched across the}} river at Humaitá that prevented further progress upriver beyond the fortress. He anchored his ships in a cove that became known as Porto Elisiário (Elisiário Port). For six months, the Brazilian warships remained stationed between Curupayty and Humaitá, bombarding both strongholds without causing any serious damage. The encirclement of Humaitá could not be completed until the Allies gained <b>full</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the river. The Allied commander-in-chief, Argentine president Bartolomé Mitre, had pressed Inhaúma for months to execute that goal. The Brazilian had, however, developed second thoughts about the enterprise and procrastinated. He believed—unfairly—that Mitre would welcome the destruction of Brazil's warships, severely weakening the Empire militarily and geopolitically.|$|E
50|$|The {{provisions}} of The New Town (Irvine) Winding Up Order 1993 officially ended the New Town Designation on 31 December 1996.
