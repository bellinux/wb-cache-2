25|$|A pellet stove {{is a type}} of {{clean-burning}} stove {{which uses}} small, biological fuel pellets which are renewable and very clean-burning. Home heating using a pellet stove is an alternative currently used throughout the world, with rapid growth in Europe. The pellets are made of renewable material –- typically wood sawdust or off-cuts. There are currently {{more than half a million}} homes in North America using pellet stoves for heat, and probably a similar number in Europe. The pellet stove typically uses a <b>feed</b> <b>screw</b> to transfer pellets from a storage hopper to a combustion chamber. Air is provided for the combustion by an electric blower. The ignition is automatic, using a stream of air heated by an electrical element. The rotation speed of the feeder and the fan speeds can be varied to modulate the heat output.|$|E

50|$|Orange oxide was {{received}} from the Refinery in five-ton mobile hoppers, which were mounted on seal hoppers to feed the reduction furnace {{at a rate of}} approximately 375 pounds per hour for producing metal grade UF4. The powder was agitated and carried through the reduction furnace by a ribbon flight screw. Dissociated ammonia was metered to the reduction reactors and passed counter-currently to the bed of uranium oxide within the chemical reactor. The off-gases from the reduction reactors were passed to a hydrogen burner where the excess hydrogen was burned and then passed through a dust collector to remove any entrained uranium dioxide that might have been present. The UO2 in the reduction furnace passed through a seal hopper and a <b>feed</b> <b>screw</b> to the first of the three hydrofluorination furnaces. The bed of UO2 was moved through the hydrofluorination furnace by ribbon flight screws and contacted counter-currently by hydrofluoric acid vapors. The UF4 was removed from the third furnace and conveyed to a packaging station where the product was packaged in 10-gallon pails for use in the Metal Plant, or in 5-ton containers for shipment to the cascades. The off-gases containing water vapor formed in the reaction and excess hydrofluoric acid was removed from the first furnace and were sent to hydrofluoric acid recovery. The gases first passed to a partial condenser that removed all of the water in the form of 70% aqueous hydrofluoric acid. The remainder of the gases was then passed to a total condenser, which condenses the remainder of the acid as anhydrous hydrofluoric acid. The gases at this point contain only the nitrogen from seals and purge gases and small amounts of hydrofluoric acid that did not condense in the total condenser. These were passed through potassium hydroxide scrubbers to remove the last traces of acid and then discharged to the atmosphere.|$|E
40|$|Solid {{pharmaceutical}} tablets can {{be manufactured}} via three processing technologies: direct compression, dry granulation and wet granulation {{before the final}} compaction process. Dry granulation using roll compaction generally involves production of ribbons, followed by milling to produce granules {{and the production of}} tablets. The mechanical properties of ribbons produced during roll compaction can influence breakage behaviour in a mill and hence the performance of a drug formulation. Therefore it is important to explore critical factors that determine the quality of ribbons. In this study, MCC Avicel PH- 102 was used as the model powder for roll compaction and the critical operating factors affecting ribbon quality were studied. MCC 102 ribbons were manufactured at a range of process conditions (roll speed, <b>feed</b> <b>screw</b> speed and compaction pressure) using the TF mini roll compactor with a serrated die & punch (DPS), grooved roll surface. The key ribbon properties measured are the powder feed ratio (defined as the ratio of <b>feed</b> <b>screw</b> speed to that of roll speed) and mass throughput ratio (defined as the mass of ribbons produced in a given time to that of fines). The porosity of ribbons was observed to depend significantly on powder feed ratio into the compaction zone. Porosity remained constant at a fixed feed ratio irrespective of the absolute roll speed and the <b>feed</b> <b>screw</b> speed conditions used. Mass throughput ratio is another factor that was introduced to describe process efficiency i. e. to draw comparison between the amount of ribbons and fines. The amount of ribbons and fines generated at a given process condition depends significantly on the <b>feed</b> <b>screw</b> speed and the compaction pressure. In addition, ribbon porosity decreased with increasing pressure but there was negligible effect on ribbon porosity when excessively high pressure (> 60 bar) was used. Ribbon porosity was also observed to decrease with increasing <b>feed</b> <b>screw</b> speed but the converse is true with increasing roll speed. In conclusion, the impact of various roll compaction process parameters were critically investigated and a detailed insight into the main factors (powder feed and mass throughput ratios) that govern the behaviour of roll compacted ribbons was provided. In future, the focus is to relate these process properties (and ribbon porosity) to granule size distribution from a milling process...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a lightweight 328 g anthropomorphic robot hand that can exert a large grasp force. We propose a combination mechanism of a flexion-drive and a force-magnification-drive for a cable driven multifingered robot hand. The flexion-drive {{consisting of a}} <b>feed</b> <b>screw</b> enables quick motion of its fingers and the force-magnification-drive consisting of an eccentric cam, a bearing and a pulley enables a firm grasp.

These mechanisms are compact enough to be installed in the developed lightweight hand.

40|$|Fiber {{thermomechanical}} refining is {{a critical}} step for the manufacturing of medium density fiberboard (MDF). To increase productivity and improve fiber quality with a reduction in energy consumption during refining, {{it is essential to}} determine appropriate refining conditions, such as the chips retention time (accumulated chip height, CH) in the pre-heater, <b>feeding</b> <b>screw</b> revolution speed (SR) in the chip feeding pipe, and the opening ratio of the discharge valve (OV) in the discharge pipe. Using multiple regression analysis, relationships between the response variables (the total fibers, the specific energy consumption obtained by the motor power consumption/the total amount of dry fibers, and the percentage of qualified fibers) and the predictor variables (OV, CH, and SR) were modeled. Specific energy consumption decreased with an increase in CH. When more chips were stored in the pre-heater, the chips were softened by the extended steam-treatment time, reducing the energy consumption. There were negative relationships between the percentage of qualified fibers and the predictor variables (OV and SR). It was reasoned that a greater proportion of coarse fibre was produced when the discharge valve opening ratio or the <b>feeding</b> <b>screw</b> speed increased. This resulted in a reduction in the percentage of qualified fibers. Due to the large sample size (1667 measurements for each variable) in this study, the resulting regression equations can be applied to estimate the productivity, energy consumption, and fiber quality during refining in an MDF mill...|$|R

The inability to specify the nip region inlet stress on a roll compactor limits comparisons between powder roll compaction models and experimental results. Therefore, this thesis investigates {{the application of a}} solid plug model to a powder <b>feed</b> <b>screw</b> of a roll compactor in order to predict the stress at the inlet nip region. ^ The feeder outlet stress predictions of the Solid Plug models developed by Tadmor et al.

Each of the Solid Plug models under-predicted the experimentally measured feeder outlet stress by orders of magnitude. Potential reasons why the Solid Plug models poorly predicted the experimental results are the accuracy of the friction coefficient measurements and the assumed values for the stress ratios. The friction coefficients could not be completely defined because the surface finish of the <b>feed</b> <b>screw</b> and barrel were unknown, and the stress ratios were assumed to equal one based on the kinetic theory of granular material (Lun, 1991). ^ The sensitivity of the Solid Plug models to the following input parameters: friction coefficients, stress ratio, and stress-density relationship are investigated. Adjusting the friction coefficients or stress ratios, such that the stress-density relationship predicts a density greater than the lower density limit, is shown to cause the Solid Plug models 2 ̆ 7 feeder outlet stress predictions to rapidly increase and become more sensitive to the mass flow rate.
