40|$|Gastrointestinal (GI) {{physiology}} {{describes the}} normal {{functions of the}} digestive tract, particularly that of its hollow organs. Within the oropharynx, oesophagus, stomach, small bowel, colon, and rectum, nutrient solids and fluids are ingested, propelled, mixed, digested, and absorbed while non-absorbable materials are stored and excreted. Critical to the digestive process are the exocrine secretions of the pancreas, liver, and <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>mucosae.</b> These secretions break and dissolve the large, complex, ingested molecules of food into smaller compounds, which are then ready for absorption into the intestinal epithelium and its circulation. The gastrointestinal wall embedding transporters and mucosal enzymes critically controls the absorption of nutrition and exogenous substances, such as drugs, across GI mucosa. The chapter gives {{an overview of the}} three major physiological functions of the gastrointestinal system, i. e., are motility, secretion, and digestion/absorption, influencing the fate of nutrition and pharmaceuticals administered into the GI tract...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: As {{the largest}} lymphoid organ {{and the largest}} {{reservoir}} of macrophages in the body, the <b>gastrointestinal</b> tract <b>mucosa</b> is probably the largest organ reservoir ofmacrophages infected with HIV- 1. To elucidate the biology of HIV- 1 infection ofintestinal macrophages, we isolated lamina propria macrophages from normal human jejunum by neutral protease digestion, purified the cells by counterfiow centrifugal elutriation, and then infected the cells with WV-i. The lamina propria macrophages were permissive to macrophagetropic isolates of HIV- 1 and substantially less perinissive to lymphocyte-tropic isolates. Compared with blood monocytes, mucosal macrophages produced 2 - 3 logs less p 24 antigen at peak infection. The reduced level of infection was not due to impaired macrophage viability, reduced CD 4 expression, or the isolation procedure. These results confirm that macrophages isolated from the <b>gastrointestinal</b> tract <b>mucosa</b> can support HIV- 1 production, albeit at a lower level than blood monocytes. The reduced level ofvirus production may reflect the unique biology ofintestinal lamina propri...|$|R

In this work, the ethanolic extract (EtOHE), flavonoid-rich (FRF), and flavonoid-deficient (FDF) {{fractions}} obtained from scapes of S. bisulcatus were investigated for gastroprotection in both rats and mice. The activity was evaluated in models for induced gastric ulcer (absolute ethanol, stress, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and pylorus ligation). The participation of mucus and prostaglandin E 2 were also investigated. Sb-EtOHE (50, 100, and 250 mg/kg, p. o.), Sb-FRF (100 mg/kg, p. o.), and Sb-FDF (100 mg/kg, p. o.) significantly reduced gastric injuries in all models. Sb- FRF altered gastric juice parameters after pylorus ligation. Sb-FRF and Sb-FDF (100 mg/kg each, p. o.) significantly increased the amount of adherent mucus in the gastric mucosa. Sb-FRF maintained the mucosal levels of prostaglandin after the administration of indomethacin. The results indicate that Sb-EtOHE, Sb-FRF and Sb-FDF have significant gastroprotective activity.

Congestive heart failure (CHF), a {{clinical}} syndrome with characteristic signs and symptoms, is a salt-avid state whose origins {{are rooted in}} neurohormonal activation, including the circulating renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). A systemic illness accompanies CHF and contributes to a progressive downhill clinical course and poor prognosis. Features include: (a) oxi/nitrosative stress in such diverse tissues as skin, skeletal muscle, heart, lymphocytes and monocytes; (b) a proinflammatory phenotype involving multiple tissues and blood and expressed as elevated levels of chemokines and such cytokines as IL- 6 and TNF-a; and (c) a catabolic state with loss of lean tissue, fat and bone that eventuates in a wasting syndrome termed cardiac cachexia.

40|$|Background: a-defensin- 5 (HD 5) {{is a key}} {{effector}} of {{the innate}} immune system with broad anti-bacterial and anti-viral activities. Specialized epithelial cells secrete HD 5 in the genital and <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>mucosae,</b> two anatomical sites that are critically involved in HIV- 1 transmission and pathogenesis. We previously found that human neutrophil defensins (HNP) - 1 and- 2 inhibit HIV- 1 entry by specific bilateral interaction both with the viral envelope and with its primary cellular receptor, CD 4. Despite low amino acid identity, human defensin- 5 (HD 5) shares with HNPs {{a high degree of}} structural homology. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we demonstrate that HD 5 inhibits HIV- 1 infection of primary CD 4 + T lymphocytes at low micromolar concentration under serum-free and low-ionic-strength conditions similar to those occurring in mucosal fluids. Blockade of HIV- 1 infection was observed with both primary and laboratory-adapted strains and was independent of the viral coreceptor-usage phenotype. Similar to HNPs, HD 5 inhibits HIV- 1 entry into the target cell by interfering with the reciprocal interaction between the external envelope glycoprotein, gp 120, and CD 4. At high concentrations, HD 5 was also found to downmodulate expression of the CXCR 4 coreceptor, but not of CCR 5. Consistent with its broad spectrum of activity, antibody competition studies showed that HD 5 binds to a region overlapping with the CD 4 - and coreceptor-binding sites of gp 120, but not to the V 3 loop region, which contains the major determinants of coreceptor-usage specificity...|$|R

The species are known to be rich in flavonoids to which their gastroprotective activity has been attributed. In this research, experimental protocols were performed to elucidate the associated mechanisms of action. Methods The activity was evaluated using induced gastric ulcer models (acetic acid and ethanol-induced gastric lesions in NEM or L-NAME pre-treated mice, and by ischemia/reperfusion). Antioxidant enzymes, serum somatostatin, and gastrin were also evaluated. Results In chronic gastric ulcers, a single daily oral dose of Sa-FRF or Sb-FRF (100  mg/kg body wt.) for 14 consecutive days accelerated ulcer healing to an extent similar to that seen with an equal dose of cimetidine. The pre-treatment of mice with NEM (N-ethylmaleimide) or L-NAME (N-nitro-L-arginine) abolished the protective activity of Sa-FRF, Sa-FDF, Sb-FDF and Sb-FRF or Sa-FRF and Sb-FRF, respectively, which indicates that antioxidant compounds and nitric oxide synthase activity are involved in the gastroprotective. Sa-FRF and Sb-FRF (100  mg/kg p. o) protected the gastric mucosa against ulceration that was induced by ischemia/reperfusion (72 and 76  %, respectively). It also decreased lipid peroxidation and restored total thiols in the gastric wall of mice that had been treated with ethanol. When administered to rats submitted to ethanol-induced gastric lesions, Sa-FRF and Sb-FRF (100  mg/kg, p. o.) increased the somatostatin serum levels, while the gastrin serum levels were proportionally decreased.
