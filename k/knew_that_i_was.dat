She reflects “I was still questioning if I was worthy to be there heading in – and I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> but it’s amazing that even after the amount of psychological sports training that I’ve had, those thoughts still {{come in and take}} you down… Usually the athletes who win are the ones who can put those thoughts aside, and tell themselves that they’ve got a good crack at winning.” Meanwhile, Cole put those thoughts aside and went on to win 6 medals at Rio.|$|E

Largely because of Louis' early interpretation of the standards and ethics of the newspaper business, I came to look with interest and confidence on the writing fraternity ... I did receive an intensive education on this trip, and Louis Howe played a great part in this education from that time on.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on April 23, 1971. Melvin Van Peebles stated that [...] "at first, only two theaters in the United States would show the picture: one in Detroit, and one in Atlanta. The first night in Detroit, it broke all the theater's records, and that was only {{on the strength of}} the title alone, since nobody had seen it yet. By the second day, people would take their lunch and sit through it three times. I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> finally talking to my audience. Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song made thousands of dollars in its first day." [...] The film grossed $15,000,000+ at the box office (about $90 million in 2016 dollars).|$|E

500|$|Although {{there had}} been stress and {{conflict}} during the recording of other Chili Peppers albums, the Mother's Milk sessions were uncomfortable due to Beinhorn's incessant desire to create a hit. He recalled {{that he and the}} band were at odds: [...] "Suffice to say that I had a very intense personal relationship [...] and somewhere along the line I fell out with [...]" [...] Beinhorn constantly clashed with Frusciante over guitar effects. According to Kiedis, [...] " [...] wanted John to have a big, crunching, almost metal-sounding guitar tone whereas before we always had some interesting acid-rock guitar tones as well as a lot of slinky, sexy, funky guitar tones." [...] Frusciante was frustrated with the producer's attitude and ultimately resented his playing on the record, feeling it was too [...] "macho". Kiedis recalled that, in the end, [...] "I couldn't tolerate his direction any longer. He was trying to squeeze something out of me that I wasn't feeling, and we got in a fight and I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> done with him." ...|$|E
500|$|The artists co-wrote [...] "Look at Me Now" [...] {{with its}} {{producers}} Afrojack, Diplo, and Free School, with additional writing from Ryan Buendia. The song was recorded and mixed by Brian Springer at The Record Plant—a studio in Los Angeles, California. [...] "Look at Me Now" [...] was released for digital download on February 1, 2011, {{and was sent}} to rhythmic contemporary radio in the United States on February 8. In an interview with Vibe magazine, Diplo revealed {{that when he was}} first asked to put the song together, he thought that [...] "Look at Me Now" [...] was not for an official release, saying: [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> working on something for a Chris Brown record, but I thought it was for a mixtape... When I did the beat, I gave it to one of his writers. Then Busta Rhymes got on it and I was like, 'Okay, {{this is going to be}} a club record.' And then when Wayne got on it 'Look at Me Now' became a radio record. It just took off from there." ...|$|E
500|$|On November 6, Mondale and Ferraro {{lost the}} general {{election}} in a landslide. They received only 41percent {{of the popular vote}} compared to Reagan and Bush's 59percent, and in the Electoral College won only Mondale's home state of Minnesota and the District of Columbia. The ticket even lost Ferraro's to congressional district, which had long been one of the more conservative districts in New York City; it tended to vote Republican in presidential races. Ferraro's presence on the ticket had little measurable effect overall. Reagan captured 55percent of women voters and about the same share of Catholic voters, the latter being the highest level yet for a Republican presidential candidate. Of the tenth of voters who decided based on the vice-presidential candidates, 54percent went to Mondale–Ferraro, establishing that Ferraro provided a net gain to the Democrats of 0.8percent. Reagan's personal appeal and campaign themes of prosperity and [...] "It's morning again in America" [...] were quite strong, while Mondale's liberal campaign alienated Southern whites and northern blue-collar workers who usually voted Democratic. Political observers generally agree that no combination of Democrats could have won the election in 1984. Mondale himself would later reflect that [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in for it with Reagan" [...] and that he had no regrets about choosing Ferraro.|$|E

500|$|While {{working for}} the U.S. Steel Hour, a {{colleague}} left {{to work for the}} educational television station WGBH-TV in Boston; her reaction was life-changing: [...] "What?! [...] There is educational television?!" [...] She later stated, [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> born to be in educational television; it was St. Paul on the highway". [...] In 1961, she began to track the progress of a court case in which a New York City nonprofit group was attempting to acquire Newark, New Jersey-based independent station WNTA-TV (channel 13), which would become the precursor of PBS station WNET, the first public television station in the New York area. [...] When channel 13 became non-commercial two years later as WNDT, Joan Ganz applied for a position as the station's publicist, but the general manager told her they needed producers. [...] "I can produce", she told him, even though she had no experience in producing television shows. [...] She later stated, [...] "I've never been qualified for any job I've been hired for". [...] According to television historian Cary O'Dell, WNDT hired her because of the ties she had made through her political activities and associations with Partisan Review. [...] Joan Ganz later said during an interview with the Archive of American Television that the transition to becoming a documentary producer was not difficult for her because she was well-read and aware of the issues of the day, adding, [...] "I felt like I'd died and gone to heaven, dealing with foreign policy and domestic policy and civil rights, which became the great passion in those years for me".|$|E
500|$|In 1936, Feller {{was signed}} by Cy Slapnicka, a scout for the Indians, for one dollar and an autographed baseball. While {{scouting}} Feller, Slapnicka said, [...] "This was a kid pitcher I had to get. I knew he was something special. His fastball was fast and fuzzy; it didn't go in a straight line; it would wiggle and shoot around. I didn't know then that he was smart and had {{the heart of a}} lion, but I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> looking at an arm the likes of which you see only once in a lifetime." [...] Feller was assigned to the Fargo-Moorhead Twins and was to report there after finishing the high school semester. Slapnicka was later named general manager of the Indians and transferred Feller's contract from Fargo-Moorhead to the New Orleans Pelicans. He was planning to add Feller, along with outfielder Tommy Henrich, to the major league roster after a few exhibition and semi-pro games without visiting either farm club. By doing so, the Indians would be in violation of Major League Baseball's rule stating that, at the time, only minor league teams could sign amateur baseball players to contracts. After a three-month investigation, concluding in December 1936, about whether the Indians broke any Major League Baseball rules by signing Feller, Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis disagreed with the argument presented by Slapnicka and Indians president Alva Bradley, but awarded both Feller and Henrich free agency and required the club to pay a $7,500 fine. Landis made the decision partly due to the testimony of Feller and his father, who wanted his son to play for Cleveland and who had also told Landis he would take the issue to court. Feller elected to remain with the Indians but Henrich joined the New York Yankees. Sports columnist Joe Williams wrote, [...] "For $7500 the Cleveland Indians received $500,000 worth of publicity. ... I feel pretty sure Mr. Alva Bradley, president of the Indians, will admit this is the cheapest investment he ever made in publicity." ...|$|E

2500|$|Warhol {{had this}} to say about the attack: [...] "Before I was shot, I always thought that I was more half-there than all-there—I always {{suspected}} that I was watching TV instead of living life. People sometimes say that the way things happen in movies is unreal, but actually it's the way things happen in life that's unreal. The movies make emotions look so strong and real, whereas when things really do happen to you, it's like watching television—you don't feel anything. Right when I was being shot and ever since, I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> watching television. The channels switch, but it's all television." ...|$|E
2500|$|Starting on August 3, 1948, during further HUAC hearings, Bentley {{received}} corroboration from Whittaker Chambers, who, under subpoena by HUAC, {{testified that}} he knew at lest two of Bentley contacts, Victor Perlo and Charles Kramer as communists and members of his earlier Ware Group. He also supported her charge that Harry Dexter White, a prominent economist who {{had worked in the}} Treasury Department, was a Communist sympathizer. [...] Of his testimony compared to hers, Chambers wrote in his memoir: [...] I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> simply back-stopping Miss Bentley, that hers was the current testimony.

In 1941 she entered—and won—her first tournament, the American Tennis Association (ATA) New York State Championship. She won the ATA national championship in the girls' division in 1944 and 1945, and after losing in the women's final in 1946, she won her first of ten straight national ATA women's titles in 1947.

As the elder Mayweather served his time, his son put all of his energy into boxing and dropped out of high school.

[...] However, he made no further comments on this, and Us Magazine later retracted the statement. In 2006, Mathis revealed that his silence had been because of death threats he received as a result of that 1982 article. On April 13, 2006, Mathis granted a podcast interview with The Strip in which he talked about the subject once again, and how some of his reluctance to speak on the subject was partially generational. During an interview with CBS News Sunday Morning on May 14, 2017, Mathis discussed the Us Magazine article and confirmed he is gay. [...] "I come from San Francisco. It's not unusual to be gay in San Francisco. I've had some girlfriends, some boyfriends, just like most people. But I never got married, for instance. I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> gay." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the United States' Formalist {{period in}} literature, American writers admired Villa's work. Mark Van Doren wrote in {{reaction}} to Selected Poems and New that it is [...] "...So natural yet in its daring so weird, a poet rich and surprising, {{and not to be}} ignored". Babette Deutsch wrote in The New Republic that Have Come, Am Here reveals that Villa's concern for [...] "ultimate things, the self and the universe. He is also on visiting terms with the world. He is more interested in himself than in the universe, and he greets the world with but a decent urbanity." [...] Although she viewed Villa's range as somewhat narrow, he [...] "soars high and plunges deep". British poet Edith Sitwell revealed in the preface of Villa's Selected Poems and New that she experienced [...] "a shock" [...] upon reading Have Come, Am Here, most notably the poem [...] "#57", [...] "a strange poem of ineffable beauty, springing straight from the depths of Being. I hold {{that this is one of}} the most wonderful short poems of our time, and reading it I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> seeing for the first time the work of a poet with a great, even an astonishing, and perfectly original gift." [...] Meanwhile, noted American poet Garret Hongo described Villa as [...] "one of the greatest pioneers of Asian American literature...our bitter, narcissistic angel of both late Modernism and early post-colonialism." [...] In his introduction to Footnote to Youth, American writer Edward J. O'Brien—who dedicated his collection Best American Short Stories of 1932 to Villa—hailed the poet as [...] "one of a half-dozen American short-story writers who count". [...] Meanwhile, {{in reaction to}} Villa's poems, e.e. cummings wrote, [...] "and i am alive to see a man against the sky".|$|E
