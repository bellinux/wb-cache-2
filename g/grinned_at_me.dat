60|$|The old steward, {{at work in}} his pantry, <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> when I {{mentioned}} the matter.|$|E
60|$|George, of whom {{it may be}} {{gathered}} {{that he was not}} wholly unsophisticated, <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> appreciatively.|$|E
6000|$|My showman, {{his hard}} face sleek with sweat, insisted on {{counting}} out three huge platelike crown pieces into my lap--for a douceur. I brushed them off {{on to the}} ground. [...] "Only to clinch the bargain," [...] he said. His teeth <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{as if he would}} gladly have swallowed me whole.|$|E
60|$|On {{opening the}} door she {{instantly}} stepped out to the threshold, and stood <b>grinning</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> in stolid silence.|$|R
6000|$|... 'By no means,' Saxon answered, <b>grinning</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{over the}} minister's head. 'I was but showing how closely the Evil One can imitate the {{workings}} of the Spirit.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! Yes. H'm! I didn't {{understand}} what that fool was saying. [...] . But never mind! It will teach the scoundrel to disturb <b>me</b> <b>at</b> {{this time of the}} day," [...] he added, <b>grinning</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with savage cynicism.|$|R
6000|$|It was {{so heavy}} that I wellnigh dropped it. [...] "All ri'!" [...] said I, and he <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> through the cab window as the cabman flicked his horse into wakefulness. It {{was a white}} packet he had given me, with red seals at either end and along its edge. [...] "If this isn't money," [...] said I, [...] "it's {{platinum}} or lead." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{glanced at}} my old friends, who <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> through the berry-stain on their faces. We reached a ditch through which the rain {{of the night before}} was {{draining}} from the fields Clark dropped the bridle, stooped down, and rubbed his face clean. Up he got again and flung the feathers from his head, and I thought that his eyes twinkled despite the sternness of his look.|$|E
60|$|As {{long as we}} {{went down}} a heathery valley that lay before Mr. Maclean's house all went well; only my guide looked {{constantly}} over his shoulder, and, when I asked him the cause, only <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> No sooner, however, had we crossed {{the back of a}} hill, and got {{out of sight of the}} house windows, than he told me Torosay lay right in front, and that a hill-top (which he pointed out) was my best land-mark.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Castle," [...] {{said the}} boy, turning in his saddle to <b>grin</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "But if I might be so bold as to advise your honour, the 'Swan' is a {{comfortable}} house, and well attended." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Cease <b>grinning</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> you ape of the rocks," [...] hissed the enraged Abi, [...] "or I {{will prove}} {{as much on}} your mocking throat," [...] and {{snatching}} out his sword he threatened him with it, adding: [...] "Now {{tell me what you}} mean, or----" ...|$|R
6000|$|MITCHENER. No. Yes. No. Yes: send {{everybody}} {{who took part}} in this disgraceful scene to the guardroom. No. Ill address the men on the subject after lunch. Parade them for that purpose--full kit. Don't <b>grin</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> Sir. Right about face. March. (The Orderly obeys and goes out.) ...|$|R
60|$|At that I boiled over, {{and lifted}} {{my hand to}} strike him; and he, drawing a knife from his rags, squatted back and <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> like a wild cat. At that, forgetting {{everything}} but my anger, I ran in upon him, put aside his knife with my left, and struck him in the mouth with the right. I was a strong lad, and very angry, and he but a little man; and he went down before me heavily. By good luck, his knife flew {{out of his hand}} as he fell.|$|E
60|$|June 16th.--Rose late, after {{a dreadful}} night; the vengeance of yesterday's opium, {{pursuing}} {{me through a}} series of frightful dreams. At one time I was whirling through empty space with the phantoms of the dead, friends and enemies together. At another, the one beloved face which I shall never see again, rose at my bedside, hideously phosphorescent in the black darkness, and glared and <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> A slight return of the old pain, at the usual time in the early morning, was welcome as a change. It dispelled the visions--and it was bearable because it did that.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{took your}} five pounds. Also {{two of the}} sovereigns," [...] he went on. [...] "I left you two pound ten." [...] His mother jerked up her head at this, facing him in dismay, and, {{immediately}} on her feet, passed back to the secretary. [...] "It's quite as I say," [...] he insisted; [...] "you should have locked it BEFORE, don't you know? It <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> there with all its charming brasses, and what was I to do? Darling mummy, I COULDN'T start--that was the truth. I thought I should find something--I had noticed; and I do hope you'll let me keep it, because if you don't it's all up with me. I stopped over on purpose--on purpose, I mean, {{to tell you what}} I've done. Don't you call that a sense of honour? And now you only stand and glower at me." ...|$|E
60|$|The rush {{of bodies}} and sea {{that was coming}} along the port runway between the cabin and the rail turned {{abruptly}} and poured to starboard. Away they went--vahine, Ah Choon, and steersman: and I swear I saw Ah Choon <b>grin</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with philosophic resignation as he cleared the rail and went under.|$|R
60|$|Wildly and more--wildly he teetered, <b>grinning</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> his gloating hatred. Then {{came the}} end. All four holds broke {{at the same}} time, and I fell, back-downward, looking up at him, my hands and feet still {{clutching}} the broken twigs. Luckily, there were no wild pigs under me, and my fall was broken by the tough and springy bushes.|$|R
60|$|Twiddling a small object, a door-key of {{peculiar}} make, in his hand, he <b>grinned</b> stolidly <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Pendennis's {{husband for}} his part {{did not attempt to}} console Sir Barnes Newcome Newcome, Baronet. I never professed to have a halfpennyworth of pity at that gentleman's command. Florac, who owed Barnes his principality and his present comforts in life, did make some futile efforts at condolence, but was {{received}} by the Baronet with such fierceness, and evident ill-humour, that he did not care to repeat his visits, and allowed him to vent his curses and peevishness on his own immediate dependents. We used to ask Laura on her return to Rosebury from her charity visits to Newcome about the poor suffering master of the house. She faltered and stammered in describing him and what she heard of him; she smiled, I grieve to say, for this unfortunate lady cannot help having a sense of humour; and we could not help laughing outright sometimes at the idea of that discomfited wretch, that overbearing creature overborne in his turn--which laughter Mrs. Laura used to chide as very naughty and unfeeling. When we went into Newcome the landlord of the King's Arms looked knowing and quizzical: Tom Potts <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and rubbed his hands. [...] "This business serves the paper better than Mr. Warrington's articles," [...] says Mr. Potts. [...] "We have sold no end of Independents; and if you polled the whole borough, I bet that five to one would say Sir Screwcome Screwcome was served right. By the way, what's up about the Marquis of Farintosh, Mr. Pendennis? He arrived at the Arms last night; went over to the Park this morning, and is gone back to town by the afternoon train." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I am absurd," [...] he cried. [...] "All men are absurd. Man is {{the absurd}} animal. We have parted from {{primordial}} motives--lust and hate and hunger and fear, {{and from all}} the tragic greatness of uncontrollable fate and we, we've got nothing to replace them. We are comic--comic! Ours is the stage of comedy in life's history, half lit and blinded,--and we fumble. As absurd as a kitten with its poor little head in a bag. There's your soul of man! Mewing. We're all at it, the poets, the teachers. How can anyone hope to escape? Why should I escape? What am I that I should expect {{to be anything but}} a thwarted lover, a man mocked by his own attempts at service? Why should I expect to discover beauty and think that it won't be snatched away from me? All my life is comic--the story of this--this last absurdity could it make anything but a comic history? and yet within me my heart is weeping tears. The further one has gone, the deeper one wallows in the comic marsh. I am one of the newer kind of men, one of those men who cannot sit and hug their credit and their honour and their possessions and be content. I have seen the light of better things than that, and because of my vision, because of my vision and for no other reason I am the most ridiculous of men. Always I have tried to go out from myself to the world and give. Those early books of mine, those meretricious books in which I pretended all was so well with the world,--I did them because I wanted to give happiness and contentment and to be happy in the giving. And all the watchers and the grippers, the strong silent men and the calculating possessors of things, the masters of the world, they <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> How I lied to please! But I tell you for all their grinning, in my very prostitution there was a better spirit than theirs in their successes. If I had to live over again----" ...|$|E
5000|$|You {{could tell}} he really {{believed}} that {{but there was something}} wrong about what he was saying. Something that didn't jell. And I thought of Lallie's warning to Danny. She had told him not to let the dark flame of the past consume the future."Lallie and the Chain? That's about right winning out over wrong." [...] Danny <b>grinned</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> an engaging urchin's and in spite of being horrified over what he had told me I found myself smiling back. [...] "Yeah well, I'm an idealist."- (page 123) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And then, Kaku, she was gone, {{and where}} her sweet face {{should have been}} I saw the yellow, mummied head of Pharaoh, he who is with Osiris, that seemed to <b>grin</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> I opened my arms again, and lo! there she sat, {{laughing}} and shaking perfume from her hair, asking me, too, what ailed me that I turned so white, and if such were the way of husbands? ...|$|R
60|$|His body falls {{against the}} door, and it shuts to with a clang, and I try to open it, and cannot. I beat my hands against its iron nails, and scream, {{and the dead}} man <b>grins</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> The light streams in through the chink beneath the massive door, and fades, and comes again, and fades again, and I gnaw at the oaken lids of the iron-bound chests, for the madness of hunger is {{climbing}} into my brain.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look, Wolf!" [...] he cried. [...] "He's <b>grinning</b> <b>at</b> <b>me!</b> Come here, boy! Tell me the truth! Have I been tricked? He {{told me that}} he was Mr. C. and I {{gave him}} everything! Look at his face how it changes! He isn't like C. now! He is like--who is it he is like? C.'s face is not so pale as that, and he does not limp. I seem to {{remember}} him too! Can't you help me? Can't you see him, boy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We got to Putney," [...] he said, [...] "with just an {{occasional}} {{run into a}} tram- car, and were going up the hill, when suddenly he turned a corner. You know his style at a corner--over the curb, across the road, and into the opposite lamp-post. Of course, as a rule one is prepared for it, but I never reckoned on his turning up there, {{and the first thing}} I recollect is finding myself sitting {{in the middle of the}} street with a dozen fools <b>grinning</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Serve her right! I hate her. I {{have got}} {{so now that}} I can't stand that sort of woman. You see her game, dont you; she can't get Constance off her hands; and she thinks there's a chance of me still. How well she knows about the governor's state of health! And Conny, too, <b>grinning</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{as if we were}} the best friends in the world. If that girl had an ounce of spirit she would not look {{on the same side of}} the street with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|He glared awfully, but {{his voice}} became gentle. [...] "There's some milk yet about that {{moustache}} of yours, my boy. You don't know what a man like me is capable of. I would hide behind a haystack if... Don't <b>grin</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> sir. How dare you? If this were not a private conversation, I would... Look here. I am responsible for the proper expenditure of lives under my command for the glory of our country and the honour of the regiment. Do you understand that? Well, then, what the devil {{do you mean by}} letting yourself be spitted like this by that fellow of the Seventh Hussars? It's simply disgraceful!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish, Mr. Stephens, {{you would}} strike my donkey-boy with your whip if {{he hits the}} donkey again," [...] cried Miss Adams, jogging up on a high, raw-boned beast. [...] "Hi, dragoman, Mansoor, you tell this boy that I won't have the animals ill used, and {{that he ought to}} be ashamed of himself. Yes, you little rascal, you ought! He's <b>grinning</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> like an {{advertisement}} for a tooth paste. Do you think, Mr. Stephens, that if I were to knit that black soldier a pair of woollen stockings he would be allowed to wear them? The poor creature has bandages round his legs." ...|$|R
6000|$|I was stooping in {{the wayside}} ditch in one more attempt to ease my foot, when once again I heard hoofs approaching. With head pushed between the dusty tussocks, I stared along the flat, white road. A small and {{seemingly}} empty cart was bowling {{along in the}} dust. As it drew near, my ears began to sing, my heart stood still. I knew that battered cart, that rough-haired, thick-legged pony. Suddenly I craned up in horror, for {{it seemed that the}} face peering low over the splashboard in my direction was that of a death's-head, <b>grinning</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> out of its gloom. Then with a cry of joy I was up and out into the road. [...] "Hi, hi!" [...] I screamed up at him.|$|R
60|$|Tying my horse, {{and making}} {{my way through}} the press in front of the tavern door, I entered the common room, and found it stifling, brawling and {{drinking}} going on apace. Scarce had I found a seat before the whole room was emptied by one consent, all crowding out of the door after two men who began a rough-and-tumble fight in the street. I had seen rough-and-tumble fights in Kentucky, and if I have forborne to speak of them it is because there always has been within me a loathing for them. And so I sat quietly in the common room until the landlord came. I asked him if he could direct me to Mr. Wright's house, as I had a letter for that gentleman. His answer was to <b>grin</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> incredulously.|$|R
5000|$|The song is much {{different}} musically and lyrically than almost all of Siouxsie and the Banshees' previous releases. It is an up-tempo love song with a skipping rhythm, light guitar work and straightforward, cheerful lyrics by Siouxsie Sioux ("...the cracks in the ground <b>grin</b> up <b>at</b> <b>me</b> / Even the creases in my shoes smile up at me...").|$|R
60|$|As I write I {{have the}} hideous picture in my mind, and again I can see St. Auban's ghastly face <b>grinning</b> up <b>at</b> <b>me</b> through the moonlit waters, {{until at last}} it was mercifully {{swallowed}} up in their black depths, and naught but a circling wavelet that spread swiftly across the stream was left to tell of what had chanced.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, there I was {{standing}} {{face to face}} with young Mr. Fox, and he <b>grinning</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> in a way that said just as plain as words could have done what a good time he'd have eating me. Goodness, I'm trembling even now to think of what he might have done before I had a chance to wag my ear if he'd known that I was the one who led his grandfather into the trap where Mr. Man could get hold of him so easily! When he didn't even speak after I'd talked to him so sweetly the idea came into my head that perhaps I might jump right over his back and so get out of the hole in that way; but it seemed as if he must have known what was in my mind, for he said with another of his beastly grins: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{explaining}} how I landed {{dead on the}} pin with my spoon out of a sand-trap at the eleventh hole yesterday. It certainly was a pretty ripe shot, considering. I'd sliced into this baby bunker, don't you know; I simply can't keep 'em straight with the iron nowadays--and there the pill was, <b>grinning</b> up <b>at</b> <b>me</b> from the sand. Of course, strictly speaking, I ought to have used a niblick, but--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If {{that had}} been all,' said Clement; 'but Angel and Bernard choose to go and sit by themselves, and I could see, from Felix's place in the choir, that they were tittering long after. I shook my head, but Nares must needs make up an odious imitation; and Bernard not only touches Angel to make her look, but <b>grins</b> impudently <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> I found myself growing burning hot with shame, and {{whenever}} they looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> their heads went down and their shoulders worked.' ...|$|R
6000|$|The colonel, {{who felt}} the need of being very diplomatic, fairly roared at this. [...] "I want you to know, Lieut. D'Hubert, that I could stand aside and see you all riding to Hades if need be. I am a man to do even that if {{the good of the}} service and my duty to my country {{required}} it from me. But that's unthinkable, so don't you even hint at such a thing." [...] He glared awfully, but his tone softened. [...] "There's some milk yet about that moustache of yours, my boy. You don't know what a man like me is capable of. I would hide behind a haystack if [...] . Don't <b>grin</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> sir! How dare you? If this were not a private conversation I would [...] . Look here! I am responsible for the proper expenditure of lives under my command for the glory of our country and the honour of the regiment. Do you understand that? Well, then, what the devil do you mean by letting yourself be spitted like this by that fellow of the 7th Hussars? It's simply disgraceful!" ...|$|R
