50|$|Early {{crossbar}} exchanges {{were divided}} into an originating side and a terminating side, while the later and prominent Canadian and US SP1 switch and 5XB switch were not. When a user picked up the telephone handset, the resulting line loop operating the user's line relay caused the exchange to connect the user's telephone to an originating sender, which returned the user a dial tone. The sender then recorded the dialed digits and passed them to the originating marker, which selected an outgoing trunk and operated the various crossbar switch stages to connect the calling user to it. The originating marker then passed the <b>trunk</b> <b>call</b> completion requirements (type of pulsing, resistance of the trunk, etc.) and the called party's details to the sender and released. The sender then relayed this information to a terminating sender (which could be on either the same or a different exchange). This sender then used a terminating marker to connect the calling user, via the selected <b>incoming</b> <b>trunk,</b> to the <b>called</b> user, and caused the controlling relay set to pass intermittent ring voltage of about 90 V AC at 20 Hz to ring the called user's phone bell, and return ringing tone to the caller.|$|R
50|$|It {{was also}} less {{efficient}} for tandem calls, since the fabric {{is unable to}} connect a trunk directly to a <b>trunk.</b> Instead, each <b>incoming</b> <b>trunk</b> that {{has the ability to}} make tandem calls has to have a line link frame appearance, {{as if it were a}} line. To avoid expense, <b>incoming</b> <b>trunks</b> were divided into groups, some of them having tandem ability and some not. This complication was avoided in places big enough to pay for a separate tandem switch.|$|R

50|$|In telecommunication, a spill-forward {{feature is}} a service feature, in the {{operation}} of an intermediate office, that, acting on <b>incoming</b> <b>trunk</b> service treatment indications, assumes routing control of the call from the originating office. This increases the chances of completion by offering the <b>call</b> to more <b>trunk</b> groups than are available in the originating office.|$|R
50|$|Ferrods were {{mounted in}} pairs, usually with {{different}} control windings, so one could supervise a switchward {{side of a}} trunk and the other the distant office. Components inside the trunk pack, including diodes, determined for example, whether it performed reverse battery signaling as an <b>incoming</b> <b>trunk,</b> or detected reverse battery from a distant trunk; i.e. was an outgoing trunk.|$|R
50|$|A tandem {{version of}} the 1XB omitted the {{incoming}} section and Line Link Frames and replaced the junctor circuits with <b>incoming</b> <b>trunks,</b> leaving only the ability to connect those <b>incoming</b> <b>trunks</b> to outgoing trunks. In many cases the resulting Crossbar tandem switch (XBT) replaced a Panel Sender Tandem, because its multi-frequency senders were able to receive seven digits and some were modified to accept ten. Sometimes it replaced an Office Select Tandem as well, since its Revertive Pulse senders were able to accept Office Brush and Group parameters. In big cities, some XBT were strictly incoming Class 4 telephone switches, some outgoing, a few both-way, and some only for tandem traffic within the metropolitan area. Specialization was less marked in less dense areas. XBT served local telephone companies until the late 20th Century when they were replaced by 4ESS switches or other digital switches.|$|R

50|$|Centrex {{was invented}} in the mid 1960s by the Engineering Department of New York Telephone to replace the PBX switchboards of large customers. It was a feature package of the 5XB {{crossbar}} system. Much equipment had to be redesigned, including <b>incoming</b> <b>trunks</b> and markers. The redesigned equipment was so expensive that usually a separate 5XB switch was used just for Centrex customers, while POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service) customers were wired to an unmodified exchange.|$|R
50|$|The PBX had the {{important}} feature {{that someone who}} received a call in error could jiggle the switchhook, causing a light to flash to recall the operator to connect the caller to the desired extension. The feature was implemented in Centrex with a timing circuit to detect this hook flash {{and set up a}} three way connection among outside party, inside party and operator. For this purpose the <b>incoming</b> <b>trunk</b> also needed its own data storage in the form of reed relay packs to store the identity of the connected line.|$|R
50|$|The Audichron {{sales force}} found sponsors, such as banks, for its time and {{temperature}} machines in a city. Once a sponsor had been obtained, Audichron would lease the machines to the local phone company. An Audichron field service engineer would then visit the telephone company and help install the Audichron equipment in the central office. The phone company would then hook up <b>incoming</b> <b>trunks</b> to the Audichron equipment and would bill the final customer (e.g., the bank) each month for the trunks and the Audichron equipment. Audichron received payments from the telephone company.|$|R

50|$|In the UK and the Commonwealth countries, a <b>trunk</b> <b>call</b> was {{the term}} for long {{distance}} calling, involving more than one telephone exchange, in contrast to making a local call.|$|R
50|$|At the {{terminating}} office, a Terminating Sender Link circuit connected a terminating sender to the trunk, {{in order}} to receive the phone number, typically using Revertive Pulse as in the panel switch to receive only the last four digits. Multi-frequency Terminating Senders were introduced in the 1950s as part of Direct Distance Dialing, and also used for incoming traffic from some local crossbar exchanges. The Terminating Sender activated an Incoming Marker, which then used a Number Group Circuit to find the line, marked an idle path, and operated the crossbar switches to use the links to connect the <b>incoming</b> <b>trunk</b> to the line.|$|R
50|$|In 1887, the railway, now {{preserved}} as the Derwent Valley Railway, was built. In 1888, Australia's first telephone <b>trunk</b> <b>call</b> {{was connected}} from Hobart to the Bush Inn Hotel in New Norfolk.|$|R
50|$|In the UK, all {{calls were}} {{chargeable}} and the term <b>trunk</b> <b>calling</b> was adopted for long distance <b>calls.</b> Initially a <b>trunk</b> <b>call</b> {{had to be}} booked in advance and a switchboard operator called the subscriber when the call set-up was completed; {{a process known as}} 'delay working'. Due to increasing demands for <b>trunk</b> <b>calls</b> from London and the associated delays in connecting them, calls to exchanges adjacent to the London director area were transferred to a new Toll exchange opened on 17 September 1921. Calls to toll area exchanges were connected on-demand whilst the originating subscriber waited thus improving service and reducing operator costs. The London Toll Area boundary was extended in 1923 and again in 1928, so that eventually Southampton, Portsmouth, Reading, Bedford, Colchester and the whole of Kent and Sussex were included. The system was later introduced to other large cities and remained in use until the late 1950s when, with the advent of Subscriber Trunk Dialling (STD), Toll was eventually phased out. The name toll was probably taken from US usage.|$|R
50|$|As per Rule 428 of the India telegraphic rules, {{no person}} without the {{sanction}} of the telegraph authority, use any telephone or cause or suffer {{it to be}} used, purposes other than the establishment of local or <b>trunk</b> <b>calls.</b>|$|R
50|$|As in {{previous}} designs, supervision of incoming calls is handled by relay sets known as <b>incoming</b> <b>trunk</b> circuits. Unlike {{in previous}} designs, {{this work is}} also done in the trunk circuit for outgoing calls, {{so there are no}} junctor circuits. Since different outgoing trunks are connected to different places and are used for different calls, their relay sets can be specialized for a particular kind of signalling or call metering (see automatic message accounting) or other peculiarity. Thus a TSPS trunk can give complete control to an operator, while an E and M signaling trunk can do the kind of signaling required of a private long-distance line, while a local outgoing trunk can be simpler.|$|R
50|$|Previous systems use relays in the <b>incoming</b> <b>trunk</b> circuit {{to control}} ringing and to return busy tone. 5XB uses a ringing {{selection}} switch (RSS): a crossbar switch with ten verticals, serving ten trunks. The various levels provide various tones, and ringing current of various durations and cadences (especially valuable for party lines). Levels 0 and 1 {{are used as}} discriminating levels to set polarity for selective ringing on tip side or ring side. An especially sensitive wire spring RT relay is used to detect off-hook from a line being rung, release the RSS hold magnet, and engage the shielded supervision relay so reverse battery answer supervision would {{be returned to the}} originating end.|$|R
50|$|Lacking {{resources}} of cultural significance such as greenstone and plentiful timber, they found outlets for their ritual {{needs in the}} carving of dendroglyphs (incisions into tree <b>trunks,</b> <b>called</b> rakau momori). Some of these carvings are protected by the J M Barker (Hapupu) National Historic Reserve.|$|R
50|$|Note {{that law}} {{explicitly}} prohibits <b>trunk</b> <b>calls</b> to a PSTN phone {{within the same}} local area in a geographic phone zone (e.g. from Kyivi to Kiev), so one cannot dial 0~2 or 0~xx for this, unless the phone exchange is misconfigured or a special circumstance occurs.|$|R

50|$|In telecommunications, {{a long-distance}} <b>call</b> or <b>trunk</b> <b>call</b> is a {{telephone}} call made to a location outside a defined local calling area. Long-distance calls are typically charged a higher billing rate than local calls. The term is not necessarily synonymous with placing calls to another telephone area code.|$|R
50|$|Google Voice and <b>Call</b> <b>Trunk</b> {{are good}} {{examples}} of the cloud bridge model. Google Voice requires that subscriber phone(s) be registered with the service, whereas <b>Call</b> <b>Trunk</b> allows any phone to be used at any time. Google Voice allows inbound call recording only; <b>Call</b> <b>Trunk</b> only allows outbound call recording.|$|R
50|$|Remote call {{forwarding}} {{is also a}} means for a suburban business to obtain a city-centre local number (with its full large-city coverage area) for inbound calls; while cheaper than a foreign exchange line, this can reduce long-distance telephony costs in markets where local calls are flat-rated but <b>trunk</b> <b>calls</b> are expensive.|$|R
50|$|Subscriber trunk {{dialling}} (STD, {{also known}} as subscriber toll dialling) is a telephone system allowing subscribers to dial <b>trunk</b> <b>calls</b> without operator assistance. The term was introduced when it first became possible for long-distance calls to be dialled directly, and is now rarely used where calls to any destination can be dialled.|$|R
50|$|In the 1940s, the Bell System {{developed}} the North American Numbering Plan, {{a system of}} initially 86 allocated area codes which were used at first only by switchboard operators to route <b>trunk</b> <b>calls</b> between plan areas. Direct long-distance dialing by customers, using the three-digit area code and a seven-digit telephone number, commenced in the 1950s.|$|R
25|$|The {{incoming}} {{section of}} the office, being fixed {{to the structure of}} the last four digits of the telephone number, had a limit of 10,000 phone numbers. In some of the urban areas where Panel was used, even a single square mile might have three or five times that many. Thus the incoming selectors of several separate switching entities shared floor space and staff, but required separate <b>incoming</b> <b>trunk</b> groups from distant offices. Sometimes an Office Select Tandem was used to distribute incoming traffic among the offices. This was a Panel office with no senders or other common control equipment; just one stage of selectors and accepting only the Office Brush and Office Group parameters. Panel Sender Tandems were also used when their greater capabilities were worth their additional cost.|$|R
5000|$|The {{operator}} or [...] "attendant" [...] had a {{large and}} complex attendant console, replacing the old, larger and even more complex switchboard and giving additional control of a connection. Its buttons and lights needed approximately fifty pairs of wires. Incoming calls arrived on an Attendant Trunk which, for customers {{with more than one}} console, waited for one to become idle and then connected to it, initially via Step by Step switches arranged as a Trunk Finder and Position Finder making up a small Automatic call distributor some years before that term was invented. Customers who preferred the old cord switchboards could use an adapted [...] "608" [...] board. In either case the console communicated with the <b>incoming</b> <b>trunk</b> with coded plus and minus 130 VDC signals on Tip, Ring or both wires.|$|R
50|$|Area code 1-200: There is no non-geographic {{area code}} 200, {{although}} exchange 1-NPA-200-XXXX now exists in many local area codes (if {{it has not}} been explicitly reserved). The 1-200 area has occasionally been used as an unused space in which to place test numbers, but is rare as in most communities a 1- indicates a long-distance <b>trunk</b> <b>call.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{regulatory}} structure in British Telecom exchanges {{differs from the}} North American system as there are no free local calls. A long-distance call is therefore known not as a [...] "toll call" [...] but as a <b>trunk</b> <b>call.</b> It traditionally carried a higher rate ("national rate" [...] instead of [...] "local rate") and requires a trunk prefix and area code be dialled before the number. A <b>trunk</b> <b>call</b> is prefixed with '0' for national calls and '00' for international calls, the European standard. It is now normal for local calls to cost the same as long distance UK calls, and is now common, for a small extra monthly charge, to allow free calls to landlines within the UK. This free call allowance does not normally cover calls to the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands, which whilst confusingly having UK national dialling codes, are separate telephone administrations.|$|R
50|$|Group {{switching}} centres {{were required}} {{because it was}} not cost effective to have direct circuits between every exchange in the country. The GSC serving the calling party would act as a concentrator for <b>trunk</b> <b>calls</b> and an operator or, if an STD dialled routing was available, it would establish the call to the appropriate GSC serving the called party's exchange.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{liberalization}} of the telecommunications industry, new carriers are assigned new carrier-specific codes for international and regional <b>trunk</b> <b>call</b> services. The codes 020 and 011 are assigned to the incumbent carrier SingTel. The other two major carriers, M1 and StarHub, do not offer any special dialling arrangements for calling to Malaysia and Indonesia, instead requiring full international dialling, the same as calling other countries.|$|R
5000|$|A long {{distance}} <b>trunk</b> <b>call</b> {{within the same}} area code used to be dialable as 1 + seven digits, without the area code. This was broken NANP-wide by 1995. In areas using [...] "toll alerting", where long-distance calls are identified by a trunk prefix (a leading 1-) to be distinguishable from flat-rate local calls, all toll calls must be dialled with the area code.|$|R
