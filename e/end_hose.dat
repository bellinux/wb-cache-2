50|$|Development was {{not limited}} to residences. Greensboro’s oldest fire house stands at 547 South Mendenhall Street. The two-story brick {{building}} served as the West <b>End</b> <b>Hose</b> Company from 1897 to 1919, when it was replaced with a new building one block north at 442 South Mendenhall. Both buildings have been adaptively reused, the first as a general store, the second as a private residence. The Wafco Mill complex began as a grist mill in 1893, with subsequent additions through 1912. The complex was restored in 1983 as condominiums.|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a process and a device for the mounting of hoses, in particular non-rigid hoses, permitted assembly suitable for mass production involving short assembly times for hoses with different dimensions (length, diameter, shape) and having two or more <b>hose</b> <b>ends</b> (branched <b>hose).</b> After fixing the first <b>hose</b> <b>end,</b> {{it is possible to}} assemble the second or further <b>hose</b> <b>ends</b> suspended in space to connectors. For this purpose, devices provide hose clips as well as devices for non-rigid hoses. Measuring devices attached to the gripper and monitoring the gripping and jointing processes determine the position of the <b>hose</b> <b>ends</b> by measuring the presence of the hose, the gripping force, the position of the gripper jaws, the jointing path and hose slip in the gripper and making corrections by means of control devices...|$|R

50|$|The City of Derby {{is served}} by {{volunteer}} firefighters in the Derby Fire Department (DFD). The DFD consists of four all-volunteer fire companies (Hotchkiss Hose Co. # 1, Storm Engine Co. # 2, East <b>End</b> <b>Hose</b> Co. # 3, and Paugassett Hook & Ladder Co. # 4) operating out of four fire stations located throughout the city. Each all-volunteer fire company is commanded by a captain and two lieutenants, who in turn are commanded by three department assistant chiefs. The assistant chiefs in turn report to the Chief of Department, Kurt Kemmesis., who reports to the Fire Commissioner, Mike Kelleher.|$|E
5000|$|In 1950, {{residents}} in the [...] "East End" [...] section of Derby's east side organized a new fire company to protect that area of the city. The unit organized independently {{from the city and}} adopted the name East <b>End</b> <b>Hose</b> Company No. 3. The company originally operated an old fire engine that was first used by the Storm Engine Company and was quartered at various locations. In 1955 the company moved into its present quarters on Derby-Milford Road, which was erected by the company's membership. The company remained independent from the city up until 1975 when the company was included and incorporated as part of the Derby Fire Department.|$|E
50|$|The College Hill Historic District {{encompasses}} 320 contributing {{buildings and}} 1 contributing site {{in a predominantly}} residential section of Greensboro. The houses were largely built between the 1890s and 1930s and include notable examples of Queen Anne, Colonial Revival, and Bungalow / American Craftsman-style architecture. The earliest house, the Walker-Scarborough House, was built about 1845, and isthought to have been built by Gov. John Motley Morehead for his daughter, Letitia upon her marriage to Stephen Walker. Located in the district is the separately listed Bumpas-Troy House (1847). Other notable buildings are the Orlo Epps House, Ward-Foust House, Ward-Gaston House, Robert P. Gorrell House, Robert C.

40|$|A {{hydraulic}} hose repair system is presented {{that was developed}} for use at the Deepwater Horizon accident site. The system can be deployed with a single ROV with two controllable arms. One arm holds the device and the other arm pushes a severed hose into the device. Hydraulic pressure is applied from the ROV to the device and a hydraulic coupling within the device is crimped into one <b>end</b> of the <b>hose.</b> The second <b>hose</b> <b>end</b> to be spliced to the first is pushed into {{the other side of}} the device and the second half of the coupling is crimped onto the second <b>hose</b> <b>end.</b> The device itself is left in place as part of the splice. The design, on-shore testing, and fabrication of multiple devices ready to deploy at the accident site took on the order of a week to complete. They stand ready to be deployed in the case of another deep-water accident. Keywords: Deepwater Horizon; Hydraulic; Hose; Repair; Couplin...|$|R

50|$|JFET {{operation}} can {{be compared}} to that of a garden hose. The flow of water through a hose can be controlled by squeezing it to reduce the cross section and the flow of electric charge through a JFET is controlled by constricting the current-carrying channel.
