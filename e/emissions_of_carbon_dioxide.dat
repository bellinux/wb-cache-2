25|$|There {{are many}} {{concerns}} regarding the {{environmental effects of}} the manufacture of hydrogen. Hydrogen is made either by electrolysis of water, or by fossil fuel reforming.

40|$|Abstract The {{enhanced}} <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> (CO 2) due {{to increased}} population density has {{significant effect on the}} growth of plant biomass. It is noted here that increased atmospheric <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> is absorbed by plant biomass during photosynthesis. In this paper, therefore, a nonlinear mathematical model is proposed to study the dynamics of population density dependent <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> in the atmosphere. The phenomenon is assumed to be governed by three nonlinearly dependent variables namely; plant biomass density, population density and the concentration <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide.</b> The model is analyzed using stability theory of ordinary differential equations and numerical simulations. It is shown that the density of plant biomass increases as the concentration <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> increases. It is, further, shown that the equilibrium density of plant biomass decreases as the density of human population increases but the concentration <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> increases in the atmosphere. The numerical simulation confirms these analytical results...|$|R
25|$|A major {{research}} project examining the geological sequestration {{of carbon dioxide}} is currently being performed at an oil field at Weyburn in south-eastern Saskatchewan. In the North Sea, Norway's Statoil natural-gas platform Sleipner strips carbon dioxide out of the natural gas with amine solvents and disposes of this carbon dioxide by geological sequestration. Sleipner reduces <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> by approximately one million tonnes a year. The cost of geological sequestration is minor relative to the overall running costs. As of April 2005, BP is considering a trial of large-scale sequestration of carbon dioxide stripped from power plant emissions in the Miller oilfield as its reserves are depleted.|$|E
25|$|In March 2009, the Waxman-Markey Climate Bill was {{introduced}} in the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce, and it has been praised by top Obama Administration officials.

The bill proposed a 20-percent emissions reduction from 2005 levels by 2020 (Obama had proposed a 14 percent reduction by 2020). Both plans aim to reduce emissions by about 80 percent by 2050. The Climate Change Bill was approved by the U.S. House of Representatives on June 26, 2009. As approved, emissions would be cut 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020, and 83 percent by 2050.|$|E
25|$|Specifically, {{the buildup}} of {{biofouling}} on marine vessels poses a significant problem. In some instances, the hull structure and propulsion systems can be damaged. The accumulation of biofoulers on hulls can increase both the hydrodynamic volume of a vessel and the hydrodynamic friction, leading to increased drag of up to 60%. The drag increase has been seen to decrease speeds by up to 10%, which can require up to a 40% increase in fuel to compensate. With fuel typically comprising {{up to half of}} marine transport costs, antifouling methods are estimated to save the shipping industry around $60 billion per year. Increased fuel use due to biofouling contributes to adverse environmental effects and is predicted to increase <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> and sulfur dioxide between 38 and 72% by 2020.|$|E
40|$|It is {{a widely}} held belief that {{anthropogenic}} addition of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere will lead to rapid climate change.

25|$|If {{energy for}} {{hydrogen}} production were available (from wind, solar, fission or fusion nuclear power etc.), {{use of the}} substance for hydrocarbon synfuel production could expand captive use of hydrogen {{by a factor of}} 5 to 10.

It is estimated that 37.7Mt/yr of hydrogen would be sufficient to convert enough domestic coal to liquid fuels to end U.S. dependence on foreign oil importation, and less than half this figure to end dependence on Middle East oil. Coal liquefaction would present significantly worse <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> than does the current system of burning fossil petroleum, but it would eliminate the political and economic vulnerabilities inherent in US oil importation before the commercialization of tight oil in North America.|$|E
25|$|Volcanoes {{are also}} part of the {{extended}} carbon cycle. Over very long (geological) time periods, they release carbon dioxide from the Earth's crust and mantle, counteracting the uptake by sedimentary rocks and other geological carbon dioxide sinks. The US Geological Survey estimates are that volcanic emissions are at a much lower level than the effects of current human activities, which generate 100–300 times the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by volcanoes. A review of published studies indicates that annual volcanic <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide,</b> including amounts released from mid-ocean ridges, volcanic arcs, and hot spot volcanoes, are only the equivalent of 3 to 5 days of human-caused output. The annual amount put out by human activities may be greater than the amount released by supererruptions, the most recent of which was the Toba eruption in Indonesia 74,000 years ago.|$|E

25|$|According to a {{literature}} assessment by Barker et al. (2007b:622), mitigation cost estimates depend critically on the baseline (in this case, a reference scenario that the alternative scenario is compared with), the way costs are modelled, and assumptions about future government policy. Fisher et al. (2007:204–206) (summarized by IPCC, 2007b:11) estimated macroeconomic costs in 2030 for multi-gas mitigation (reducing <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> and other GHGs, such as methane) as between a 3% decrease in global GDP {{to a small}} increase, relative to baseline. This was for an emissions pathway consistent with atmospheric stabilization of GHGs between 445 and 710 ppm CO2-eq. In 2050, the estimated costs for stabilization between 710 and 445 ppm CO2-eq ranged between a 1% gain to a 5.5% decrease in global GDP, relative to baseline. These cost estimates were supported by a moderate amount of evidence and much agreement in the literature (IPCC, 2007b:11,18).|$|E

A third case, Comer v.

Described as a nuisance lawsuit, it was dismissed by District Court. However, the District Court's decision was overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which instructed the District Court to reinstate several of the plaintiffs' climate change-related claims on 22 October 2009. The Sierra Club sued the U.S. government over failure to raise automobile fuel efficiency standards, and thereby decrease carbon dioxide emissions.|$|E
