40|$|Border' and 'Tehran 2006 ' are {{two related}} {{parts of a}} {{photographic}} project on Iran dealing with hardship and isolation {{on both sides of}} the border. 'Border' comprises twelve photographs (size 4 'x 6 '). 'Tehran 2006 ' is one panoramic image (size 4 'x 10 ') which combines ten images. ‘Border’ focuses on untold stories of Iranians in exile. Using the codes of documentary, yet avoiding the usual generic approach, ‘Border’ combines fact and fiction. Reminiscent of movie posters, the work concentrates on the fantasy of return, using Beckett’s notion of waiting in ‘Waiting for Godot’ as a metaphor for the bleak situation facing Iranians today. Set against the cityscape of post–revolution Iran, ‘Tehran 2006 ’ focuses on the reality of the ordinary in extraordinary times. The project eschews the usual representations of Iran such as social <b>documentary,</b> <b>abstract</b> photography, or exotica. Instead, it echoes contemporary Iranian cinema, using non- actors and focusing on an apparently ‘small’ subject, treated allegorically to allude to wider social issues. Together, the projects deal with hardship and isolation {{on both sides of the}} border, challenging the fantasies Iranians have of both East and West. Those living in Iran idealize life in the West; those living outside long for ‘home’. But both groups share the will to survive - evident in the stories participants told Tabrizian - seeing survival as a strategy of resistance. These are large-scale productions akin to film shoots, with high production values and meticulous research. Tabrizian is creative author and director, assisted by Golding (lighting) and Nava (producer). Both projects were funded by AHRC (Small Grants and Research Leave) and ACE (total £ 6000). ‘Tehran 2006 ’ was purchased for Moderna Museet’s permanent collection, auctioned at Christies, Dubai (November 2007), and will show at Tate Modern 2008. Both projects were discussed at Tate Modern conference ‘Global Photography Now’ (Sept 2006). Images and related essays were published in Portfolio No 44 (‘Border’ alongside Hamid Naficy essay); Next Level, No. 2 Vol 5 (‘Tehran’ alongside Tabrizian essay); New Formations, No. 62 (forthcoming...|$|E

40|$|<b>ABSTRACT.</b> <b>Documentary</b> {{scientific}} evidence supports {{the notion that}} the small pelagics fishery in the Gulf of California does not measurably affect the physical habitat or the functional relationships between the species comprising the pelagic ecosystem. Also, there is little information that suggests any negative effects of the small pelagic fishery operations on critically endangered, endemic species, i. e., vaquita and totoaba. Under the current management regime, small pelagics fishery in the Gulf of California has recovered twice from collapses during the last 30 years. Although the small pelagics abundance varies greatly, the long-term productivity of the target species and the structure and function of the pelagic ecosystem are not compromised because the fishery relies on a suitable logistic and administrative platform, which is consistent with international standards for responsible fisheries, precautionary approach and ecosystem-based fisheries management principles...|$|R

Tracing several generations’ aesthetic responses to the Cultural Revolution, the Tiananmen Square Massacre, and the present day influx of global capital, I advocate for a specific type of aesthetic practice that elides the distinction between the <b>documentary</b> method and <b>abstract</b> practice. By deliberately conflating these categories I argue that these works are united in their quest to dismantle dominant ideologies, and undermine authoritative narratives by making visible their flaws and contradictions with everyday reality. Moreover, my research illuminates an evolving relationship to the documentary method – one that expands and challenges existing definitions of realism. Ultimately, my research is based on an ethical framework which demands a reorientation of our historical perspective, and a new understanding of history that is not couched in teleological notions of progress...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{an inquiry into}} the {{creative}} processes of poetry and poetic expression in documentary. The practice-based element is a 60 minute video about a poet living in Exeter, UK, called James Turner. The documentary is entitled, The Knotweed Factor. This written element of the thesis contextualises the investigation as a discourse on blindness and visual impairment. There are few representations of blindness and/or visual impairment (VI) in The Knotweed Factor. Rather, the documentary is concerned with how visual information (e. g., filming a poet) is translated non-visually (e. g., {{the sound of the}} poem being recited). It also addresses the issue of how the non-visual is translated into the visual. I argue in this text that blindness/VI is marginalised in visual studies/culture. This is unfortunate because blindness/VI studies provides valuable context for understanding the dynamics of sound and vision in creative media, which is a central concern of The Knotweed Factor. The rationale for taking this approach is as follows: During the editing, it was noticed that Turner (who is sighted) provides a kind of unprompted audio description (AD) of events in his environment to the audience, as if he is participating in a radio documentary. This raised questions, not only about the ekphrastic possibilities of his technique, but also about the potential to contextualise such scenes as a disquisition on blindness/VI. Blindness/VI is an important and under-theorised element of visual studies/culture (VS/C). Many films, plays, animations, documentaries, and television programmes are audio described. AD enables the blind/visually impaired (also VI) to comprehend and enjoy visual action. It is suggested here that AD theory is an insufficient model for critically reflecting on the creative processes in The Knotweed Factor. This is because the field is presently more concerned with practicability than with aesthetics. It seemed more helpful to address the broader question of how blindness/VI is positioned in VS/C. Doing so has highlighted instances of exclusion and marginalisation in VS/C. In the course of the video production, it was discovered that the interaction of dreams, memories, and ideas (the mindscape) informs the temporal creative process. Most analytical models within VS/C (e. g., Deleuze) offer a dialectical approach to understanding creativity. Henri Bergson, however, proposes a theory of multiplicity, which considers the interplay of phenomenological creativity of the mindscape as a homogenous, multifaceted process, in place of a dialectical one. Martha Blassnigg interrogates Bergson’s responses to audiovisual media and argues that Bergson’s multiplicity formula is more useful for understanding these processes, both for artist and audience. Blassnigg interprets Bergson’s theory as a universality of idea communication. This thesis considers what the universality of audiovisual experience implies for blindness/VI studies. It does so by contextualising the written research as a discourse on VS/C. In The Knotweed Factor, the emotions, sounds, and visual ideas, memories, and dreams which inform James Turner’s creativity are conveyed to the audience in two ways: 1) By sound (Turner’s recitations, interviews, and conversations), and 2) by the <b>documentary’s</b> <b>abstracted</b> audiovisualisations of Turner’s poetry and mindscape. For Turner, the ‘image’ is a personalised, innate phenomenon. It is ephemeral, intangible imagination. Turner’s experience (audiovisualised in The Knotweed Factor) is compared in this written part of the thesis to pre-Socratic ideations of image-making. It is argued that for many cultures, the image was (and for some remains) an emanation of spirit or idea. In other words, the image was considered a transcendent force, and the ‘soul’ of the image eternal and universal. This transcendence is considered in this written element of the thesis as a bridge between the present academic gap in the fields of blindness/VI studies and visual studies/culture. In this text, The Knotweed Factor serves as a case-study to test how non- and minimal-visual elements of audiovisual art and media are positioned in VS/C. Constructed here is a history of the interpretation of blindness and the image, from pre-Socratic aesthetics to the Enlightenment, where ideas concerning the phenomenology of blindness and visual impairment were transformed into epistemological inquiries. This approach enables the researcher to reflect critically on the aesthetics of The Knotweed Factor, using the framework of the non-visual (in this case recited poetry) to test and interrogate the visual (i. e., ‘poetically’ visualised poetry) ...|$|R
40|$|My {{argument}} is that documentary texts can be transformed into artworks via the processes of intertextuality and detournement, when they are exhibited as video installations. I argue that early 1920 s modernist avant-garde painter-filmmakers shared with contemporary documentary video installation painter-filmmakers particular tendencies, characteristics and interests. The bodies of work in each period explore the generic properties of <b>documentary</b> through (primarily) <b>abstract</b> visual associations, rather than through a conventional linear space. Important 1920 s modernist avant-garde films by Dziga Vertov, Luis Bunuel, Salvador Dali, Joris Ivens, Man Ray and others will be considered in highlighting the relationship between documentary and avant-garde cinema. I use this discussion {{as a basis for}} examining my own work: for the creative component of this thesis, I filmed and edited a three screen video installation. I interviewed 67 Australian Muslims and used these interviews to explore the use of documentary in video installation. The theoretical framework I used is based on the following: Julia Kristeva's notion of intertextuality, derived from Mikhail Bahktin's work on dialogism, to interpret how documentary texts take on conventions appropriate to other genres; Guy Debord's concept of detournement to provide a theory for the reuse of pre-existing artistic elements found in documentary film; genre theory to interpret interactions between documentary texts; Ludwig Wittgenstein's notion of 'family resemblance' to explore the indistinct boundaries of documentary; and Pascal Beausse's analysis of how artists have hijacked documentary. I also draw on Bill Nichols's analytical framework of documentary modes (poetic, expository, observational, participatory, performative, reflexive) to explore documentary in cinema and installation art. The documentary genre is not habitually discussed outside film, television, photography or the web. My research demonstrates that the genre has found its place in other areas of artistic practice and can also apply to medium of video installation...|$|R
40|$|With the {{proliferation}} of video-rich data on the Internet, there is a pressing need for search tools that can retrieve not only relevant videos from a corpus, but also relevant snippets within a video. For retrieving relevant videos, current search technologies hinge on labor-intensive manual annotation of tags, which are subjective and often incomplete. To fully automate search and retrieval systems, we need tools that can understand the content presented in videos and automatically generate labels that accurately describe them. Towards that goal, we consider a video with subtitles, and focus on two problems: a) What/ {{who are in the}} video key frames? and b) What do the textual entity mentions in subtitles refer to? State-of-the-art methods largely adopt a supervised paradigm, relying on expensive manually created training examples to indicate the mapping between the visual and textual entities. In contrast, we address these questions using a weakly supervised paradigm, where the text may provide some clues on the vision and vice versa. We further apply it to the problem of wildlife recognition in nature documentaries. In a weakly supervised setting, the problem of recognizing entities in vision and language presents a host of challenges for vision, text and the association of text and vision. On the vision side, we deal with a scenario where there are no visual demarcators to indicate the location of an animal. In fact, it is not even known if there are animals at all in a certain key frame. Additionally, since we are dealing with animals shot in their natural habitat, there are challenges due to self-occlusion, camouflage, illumination etc. On the textual side, while we have tools to detect entity mentions in the text, not all of them are pertinent to animals. Even when the mentions refer to animals, they are often so ambiguous {{that it is impossible to}} resolve them correctly without a holistic understanding of the context. As far as the linking of text and vision is concerned, the absence of visual demarcators in the visual data coupled with the presence of ambiguous mentions in text makes it harder to reliably tie together the entities in vision and language. That is, there are no ready examples to show the association in a limited, diverse dataset. In this thesis, we present three major contributions that address these challenges. First, we present a multi-modal domain adaptation framework for multi-label classification. Here, we propose an algorithm to learn from an external labeled source dataset, and iteratively adapt to a target dataset, by leveraging the weakly associated textual subtitles that come with the video. We prove that this approach is significantly better than a) a purely vision-based approach or b) purely text-based approach or c) an approach that uses both text and vision, but without labeled examples or d) an approach that uses both text and vision, and labeled (out-of-domain) examples, but without the adaptive learning. Next, we investigate image representation and object recognition models learned from video documentaries by using the weak supervision of the textual subtitles. In particular, we study a support vector machine on top of activations of a pre-trained convolutional neural network, as well as a Naive Bayes framework on a ‘bag-of-activations’ image representation, where each element of the bag is considered separately. On testing the models on a target dataset shot in entirely different conditions, we found that the ‘bag-of-activations’ based model outperformed classical models by a huge margin. The third and final contribution capitalizes on the inherent characteristics in the video, such as the temporal coherence in video frames, and the dependencies within and across the visual and textual modalities. We prove that this integrated modelling yields significantly better performance over text-based and vision-based approaches. We show that textual mentions that cannot be resolved using text-only methods are resolved correctly using our method. The methods proposed here take us a step closer to object recognition in the wild and automatic video indexing. While the methods presented here have been validated on wildlife documentaries, they are all quite generic and can be applied to a plethora of other genres, beyond wildlife, beyond subtitles, or even beyond video <b>documentaries.</b> Contents <b>Abstract</b> iii List of Abbreviations vii List of Symbols ix Contents xi List of Figures xv List of Tables xix 1 Introduction 1 1. 1 Automatic Wildlife Recognition: Setup and Challenges [...] 2 1. 2 Inspiration: Vision, Language and the Human Brain [...] . 9 1. 3 Motivations and Goals [...] . 12 1. 4 Contributions and ThesisOutline [...] . 13 2 Fundamentals 17 2. 1 Statistics and MachineLearning [...] . 19 2. 1. 1 Basic Concepts of Probability Theory [...] . 19 2. 1. 2 GaussianDistribution [...] . 21 2. 1. 3 Probabilistic Graphical Models [...] . 22 2. 1. 4 Expectation-Maximization [...] . 33 2. 2 ComputerVision [...] 34 2. 2. 1 ConvolutionalNeuralNetwork [...] 36 2. 2. 2 Domain shift [...] 38 2. 3 NaturalLanguageProcessing [...] . 39 2. 3. 1 NamedEntityRecognition [...] 39 2. 3. 2 CoreferenceResolution [...] . 40 2. 3. 3 EntityLinking [...] . 40 2. 4 Conclusions [...] . 41 3 Exploiting Labeled External Data for Weakly Supervised Wildlife Recognition 43 3. 1 Introduction [...] . 44 3. 2 Related work [...] 46 3. 3 Background [...] . 48 3. 4 General Framework [...] . 49 3. 4. 1 Generative Model [...] . 49 3. 4. 2 Naive Bayes Model [...] . 50 3. 4. 3 Binarization [...] . 50 3. 4. 4 Expectation-Maximization [...] . 51 3. 5 ImplementationDetails [...] 52 3. 5. 1 Pre-processing of the Textual and Visual Data..... 53 3. 5. 2 Learning from ImageNet [...] 54 3. 6 Experiments and Results [...] 55 3. 6. 1 How Good is Classification Solely Based on ImageNet?. 56 3. 6. 2 How Good is the Text?
