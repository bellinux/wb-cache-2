Briefly, the full width of the photoelectron spectrum (from the highest kinetic energy/lowest binding energy point to the low kinetic energy cutoff) is measured and subtracted from the photon energy of the <b>exciting</b> <b>radiation,</b> and the difference is the work function.

50|$|Spontaneous {{emission}} is {{the process}} in which a quantum mechanical system (such as an atom, molecule or subatomic particle) transitions from an excited energy state to a lower energy state (e.g., its ground state) and emits a quantum {{in the form of}} a photon. Spontaneous emission is ultimately responsible for most of the light we see all around us; it is so ubiquitous that there are many names given to what is essentially the same process. If atoms (or molecules) are excited by some means other than heating, the spontaneous emission is called luminescence. For example, fireflies are luminescent. And there are different forms of luminescence depending on how excited atoms are produced (electroluminescence, chemiluminescence etc.). If the excitation is affected by the absorption of radiation the spontaneous emission is called fluorescence. Sometimes molecules have a metastable level and continue to fluoresce long after the <b>exciting</b> <b>radiation</b> is turned off; this is called phosphorescence. Figurines that glow in the dark are phosphorescent. Lasers start via spontaneous emission, then during continuous operation work by stimulated emission.|$|E

30|$|As {{mentioned}} above, electron transitions {{can happen}} at low {{energy of the}} <b>exciting</b> <b>radiation</b> (∼ 0.4 eV) which correspond to wavelength of ∼ 3.1 μ m. Yet, the photo-emf signal is observed at the radiation wavelengths up to 5 μ m in our measurements. The presence of the photo-emf response in this range can only be explained if the QD layer is considered as a single ensemble of mutually interacting centers. An effective positive charge in the QD layer forms a potential well for electrons in the conduction band. This leads to reduction of energy needed for electron transitions from the QD ensemble states to the conduction band. Partial emptying of the states makes electron transitions possible and, at the same time, {{does not lead to}} significant change in the potential wells depth. As a result, electron transitions can happen at the <b>exciting</b> <b>radiation</b> energies as low as 0.25 eV. Hole transitions also can happen at these energies via a large number of excited states in the QD ensemble.|$|E
