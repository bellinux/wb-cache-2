500|$|In May 1977 Genesis {{released}} Spot the Pigeon, {{an extended}} play of three tracks left off Wind & Wuthering. It peaked at No. 14 on the UK singles chart. It {{was the final}} Genesis release before Hackett left the group. He had been writing more material {{on his own and}} found it increasingly difficult to contribute more of his ideas within a group context. He wished to embark on a solo career and [...] "take the risk in order to find out just how good <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> own". News of Hackett's departure coincided with the band's double live album Seconds Out, recorded in Paris on the A Trick of the Tail and Wind & Wuthering tours and released in October 1977. It reached No. 4 in the UK and No. 47 in the US.|$|E

[...] "It was 1959, I was 15 years old and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> own." ...|$|E

[...] "I thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> way as a writer," [...] Butler recalled in her short fiction collection Bloodchild and Other Stories. [...] "In fact, I had five more years of rejection slips and horrible little jobs ahead of me before I sold another word." ...|$|E

2500|$|Daryl Braithwaite and {{his twin}} brother, Glenn, were born on 11 January 1949 {{and raised in}} a working class family in Melbourne. His father, a plumber, worked on the Snowy Mountains Scheme in the mid-1950s. Braithwaite {{attended}} Punt Road Primary School in South Yarra, then Christ Church Grammar, where the twins sang in the school choir. He later said, [...] "I will always recall the horror of my first solo in the choir singing 'Once in Royal David's City' when the choir master, Leonard Fullard, gave me a note and then suddenly <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> own. It was terrifying." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 1902, the Giants sent catcher Frank Bowerman {{to persuade}} Taylor {{to return to}} the Giants. [...] Bowerman sat in the stands while Taylor was {{pitching}} and negotiated the terms of Taylor's return to the Giants by signing. Taylor recalled: Frank sat in the grandstand and every time I walked out to the pitching mound he kept talking to me with his fingers. I kept shaking my head [...] "No", and Frank kept boosting the money. Soon, I nodded my head [...] "Yes", and that night <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> way back to New York with Frank.|$|E
2500|$|The NFL Draft {{was held}} on April 29–30, 2006. The Tennessee Titans drafted Vince Young with their first round pick (3rd choice overall), {{confirming}} the predictions of many draft experts. He was the first quarterback taken in the draft, with the Titans choosing him instead of Matt Leinart. The Titans general manager, Floyd Reese, said Young's upside was the deciding factor in his being chosen. Reese said, [...] "Last night at 11:35, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> knees praying ... he will rewrite the position. This guy physically is such a combination of arms and legs. People want to make him {{out to be a}} Michael Vick. He's not that. He's different." ...|$|E

2500|$|Abu Ghosh mayor Salim Jaber {{attributed}} the {{good relations with}} Israel to the great importance attached to being hospitable: [...] "We welcome anybody, regardless of religion or race." [...] According to a village elder interviewed by the Toronto Globe and Mail: [...] "Perhaps because {{of the history of}} feuding with the Arabs around us we allied ourselves with the Jews...against the British. We did not join the Arabs from the other villages bombarding Jewish vehicles in 1947. The Palmach fought many villages around us. But there was an order to leave us alone. The other Arabs never thought there would be a Jewish government here...During the first truce of the War of Independence, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> way to Ramallah to see my father and uncles, and I was captured by Jordanian soldiers. They accused me of being a traitor and tortured me for six days." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The Twist" [...] had {{previously}} peaked at #16 on the Billboard {{rhythm and blues}} chart, in the 1959 version recorded by its author, Hank Ballard, whose band The Midnighters first performed the dance on stage. Checker's [...] "Twist", however, was a nationwide smash, aided by his many appearances on Dick Clark's American Bandstand, the Top 10 American Bandstand ranking of the song, and the teenagers on the show who enjoyed dancing the Twist. The song was so ubiquitous that Checker felt that his critics thought that he could only succeed with dance records typecasting him as a dance artist. Checker later lamented:"...in a way, [...] "The Twist" [...] really ruined my life. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> {{way to becoming a}} big nightclub performer, and [...] "The Twist" [...] just wiped it out... It got so out of proportion. No one ever believes I have talent." [...] By 1965 alone, [...] "The Twist" [...] had sold over 15 million copies, and was awarded multiple gold discs by the RIAA.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the nineties}} progressed, Harper {{maintained}} her role and by 1996, {{was one of}} only three remaining cast members of the original 16, alongside screen son, Karl Burnett (Nick Harrison) and Angela Dotchin (Kirsty Knight). Dotchin departed two years later, leaving only the Harrison family as the remaining original cast. Several months later, Harper quit the role after falling in love with a man she met at a fancy dress party. Harper was pleased to be in a relationship upon leaving the show due to Jenny's constant thoroughfare of poor romances. The character of Jenny's best friend, Marj Brasch (Elizabeth McRae) was reintroduced to the soap in her final episodes as a means of writing her out. Shortly after quitting Harper realized the extent of how happy she was, stating, [...] "The week I finished <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> bike cycling away and I thought, 'Oh, I have no lines to learn, how wonderful'." [...] Following Jenny's departure in August 1998, only one original cast member remained on the show, being that of her son Nick. Harper reprised the role in 2002 for her onscreen son's wedding.|$|E

2500|$|An early 1996 Q {{magazine}} interview {{revealed that}} relations between Blur members had become very strained; journalist Adrian Deevoy {{wrote that he}} found them [...] "on {{the verge of a}} nervous breakup". Coxon, in particular, began to resent his bandmates and, in a rejection of the group's Britpop aesthetic, made a point of listening to noisy American alternative rock bands such as Pavement. Albarn grew to appreciate Coxon's tastes in lo-fi and underground music, and recognised the need to significantly change Blur's musical direction once again. [...] "I can sit at my piano and write brilliant observational pop songs all day long but you've got to move on", he said, and decided to let Coxon have more creative control over their new album. Albarn visited Iceland during this period, stating that, [...] "I used to have a recurring dream, as a child, of a black sand beach. And one hazy, lazy day , I was watching the TV and I saw a programme about Iceland, and they had black beaches. So I got on a plane, and booked into the Saga hotel. I didn't know it meant Saga holidays, for older people—I thought it was Saga as in Nordic sagas. But it was actually an OAP cruise hotel. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> own: I didn't know anybody. I went into the street, Laugavegur, where the bars are, and that was it." ...|$|E
