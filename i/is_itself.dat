5|$|Lander {{argues that}} the {{structure}} of the work <b>is</b> <b>itself</b> symbolic. As well as the division of the poem into 23 parts, each signifying and describing one day of Donne's illness, each part <b>is</b> <b>itself</b> split in three – representing the Trinity. The use of three elements – Meditation, Expostulation, and Prayer – also matches the three services found in the Book of Common Prayer, a common influence on devotional writers of Donne's era.|$|E

5|$|Summation {{describes}} {{the addition of}} arbitrarily many numbers, usually more than just two. It includes {{the idea of the}} sum of a single number, which <b>is</b> <b>itself,</b> and the empty sum, which is zero. An infinite summation is a delicate procedure known as a series.|$|E

5|$|A {{large part}} of the massif is covered by ice fields and is cut by {{numerous}} glaciers, mostly flowing northwestwards on the French side; southeastwards on the Italian side and eastwards on the Swiss side. With much steeper slopes on the Italian side, many glaciers drop very sharply and some, such as the Miage Glacier and the Brenva Glacier, are very heavily covered in rock debris. The massif <b>is</b> <b>itself</b> defined by broad valleys which formed along fault lines and which have subsequently been shaped by ice during the last glacial period of the ice age.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the bark}} {{functions}} as a protective barrier, it <b>is</b> <b>itself</b> attacked by boring insects such as beetles. These lay their eggs in crevices and the larvae chew {{their way through the}} cellulose tissues leaving a gallery of tunnels. This may allow fungal spores to gain admittance and attack the tree. Dutch elm disease is caused by a fungus (Ophiostoma species) carried from one elm tree to another by various beetles. The tree reacts to the growth of the fungus by blocking off the xylem tissue carrying sap upwards and the branch above, and eventually the whole tree, is deprived of nourishment and dies. In Britain in the 1990s, 25 million elm trees were killed by this disease.|$|E
5|$|An st-{{planar graph}} is a {{connected}} planar graph {{together with a}} bipolar orientation of that graph, an orientation that makes it acyclic with a single source and a single sink, {{both of which are}} required {{to be on the same}} face as each other. Such a graph may be made into a strongly connected graph by adding one more edge, from the sink back to the source, through the outer face. The dual of this augmented planar graph <b>is</b> <b>itself</b> the augmentation of another st-planar graph.|$|E

5|$|Both of Wollstonecraft's novels also {{critique}} {{the discourse}} of sensibility, a moral philosophy and aesthetic that had become popular {{at the end of}} the eighteenth century. Mary <b>is</b> <b>itself</b> a novel of sensibility and Wollstonecraft attempts to use the tropes of that genre to undermine sentimentalism itself, a philosophy she believed was damaging to women because it encouraged them to rely overmuch on their emotions. In The Wrongs of Woman the heroine's indulgence on romantic fantasies fostered by novels themselves is depicted as particularly detrimental.|$|E
5|$|CryoSat-2 is {{operated}} {{as part of}} the CryoSat programme to study the Earth's polar ice caps, which <b>is</b> <b>itself</b> part of the Living Planet programme. The CryoSat-2 spacecraft was constructed by EADS Astrium, and was launched by ISC Kosmotras, using a Dnepr carrier rocket, on 8 April 2010. On 22 October 2010, CryoSat-2 was declared operational following six months of on-orbit testing.|$|E
5|$|Designing {{reversible}} {{rules for}} block cellular automata, and {{determining whether a}} given rule is reversible, is easy: for a block cellular automaton to be reversible it is necessary and sufficient that the transformation applied to the individual blocks at {{each step of the}} automaton <b>is</b> <b>itself</b> reversible. When a block cellular automaton is reversible, the time-reversed version of its dynamics can also be described as a block cellular automaton with the same block structure, using a time-reversed sequence of partitions of cells into blocks, and with the transition function for each block being the inverse function of the original rule.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to cellular stresses– such as infection, heat shock, or oxidative damage– heat shock proteins that identify misfolded or unfolded proteins and target them for proteasomal degradation are expressed. Both Hsp27 and Hsp90—chaperone proteins have {{been implicated in}} increasing {{the activity of the}} ubiquitin-proteasome system, though they are not direct participants in the process. Hsp70, on the other hand, binds exposed hydrophobic patches on the surface of misfolded proteins and recruits E3 ubiquitin ligases such as CHIP to tag the proteins for proteasomal degradation. The CHIP protein (carboxyl terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein) <b>is</b> <b>itself</b> regulated via inhibition of interactions between the E3 enzyme CHIP and its E2 binding partner.|$|E
5|$|In {{the history}} of Europe, the Middle Ages or Medieval Period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century.

The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three {{traditional}} divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period <b>is</b> <b>itself</b> subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages.|$|E
