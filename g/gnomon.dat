5|$|Although the Greeks and Romans {{did much}} to advance water clock technology, they still {{continued}} to use shadow clocks. The mathematician and astronomer Theodosius of Bithynia, for example, {{is said to have}} invented a universal sundial that was accurate anywhere on Earth, though little is known about it. Others wrote of the sundial in the mathematics and literature of the period. Marcus Vitruvius Pollio, the Roman author of De Architectura, wrote on the mathematics of gnomons, or sundial blades. During the reign of Emperor Augustus, the Romans constructed the largest sundial ever built, the Solarium Augusti. Its <b>gnomon</b> was an obelisk from Heliopolis. Similarly, the obelisk from Campus Martius was used as the <b>gnomon</b> for Augustus's zodiacal sundial. Pliny the Elder records that the first sundial in Rome arrived in 264, looted from Catania, Sicily; according to him, it gave the incorrect time until the markings and angle appropriate for Rome's latitude were used—a century later.|$|E
5|$|Although {{this did}} not apply to the Subura slums, which were still as rickety and fire-prone as ever, he did leave a mark on the monumental {{topography}} of the centre and of the Campus Martius, with the Ara Pacis (Altar of Peace) and monumental sundial, whose central <b>gnomon</b> was an obelisk taken from Egypt. The relief sculptures decorating the Ara Pacis visually augmented the written record of Augustus' triumphs in the Res Gestae. Its reliefs depicted the imperial pageants of the praetorians, the Vestals, and the citizenry of Rome.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the year {{different}} sections of the rod serve as the style, which is the part of the <b>gnomon</b> that indicates the time by casting its shadow on the dial face. At the summer solstice, when the Sun is highest (farthest above the equatorial plane), the style is closest to the top of the rod, and at the winter solstice, when the Sun is lowest, it is closest to the bottom. At the equinoxes, when the Sun is on the equatorial plane, the style is exactly in the center of the length of the rod. The style of the equatorial sundial is parallel to the Earth's axis of rotation.|$|E
5|$|Three Han {{mathematical}} treatises still exist. These are the Book on Numbers and Computation (Suan shu shu 算數書), the Arithmetical Classic of the <b>Gnomon</b> and the Circular Paths of Heaven (Zhoubi Suanjing 周髀算經) and the Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art (Jiu zhang suan shu 九章算術). Han-era mathematical achievements include {{solving problems}} with right-angle triangles, square roots, cube roots, and matrix methods, finding more accurate approximations for pi, providing mathematical {{proof of the}} Pythagorean theorem, use of the decimal fraction, Gaussian elimination to solve linear equations, and continued fractions to find the roots of equations.|$|E
5|$|To {{the south}} of the church there are the {{remnants}} of a stone preaching cross. The cross was originally situated on Poulton's boundary and marked a resting place for mourners travelling long distances to bury corpses at St Chad's. Only the two circular steps into which the original structure was set remain; the cross shaft has been replaced by an octagonal pillar. The pillar was used as a sundial until the early 20th century when the <b>gnomon</b> was stolen. The steps function as a memorial for present-day mourners at St Chad's, in a small garden of remembrance. The churchyard is noted locally for its display of crocuses and other flowering bulbs in early springtime.|$|E

5|$|Handbooks, guides, manuals, and treatises {{for various}} {{subjects}} {{were written in}} the Han. The Western Han Book of Fan Shengzhi (Fan Shengzhi shu 氾勝之書) written during Emperor Cheng's reign {{is one of two}} manuals on agricultural techniques and processes that have survived from the Han. The other is the Eastern Han Monthly Instructions for the Four Classes of People (Simin yueling 四民月令) written by Cui Shi (催寔) (d. 170 CE). Mathematical treatises included the Book on Numbers and Computation (Suan shu shu) The Arithmetical Classic of the <b>Gnomon</b> and the Circular Paths of Heaven (Zhoubi Suanjing), and the Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art (Jiuzhang Suanshu). There were also works on astronomy, such as the Miscellaneous Readings of Cosmic Patterns and Pneuma Images (Tianwen qixiang zazhan 天文氣象雜占) from the 2nd-century-BCE Mawangdui Silk Texts and Zhang Heng's (78139 CE) Spiritual Constitution of the Universe (Lingxian 靈憲) published in 120 CE.|$|E
5|$|Being {{the head}} {{official}} for the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo {{was an avid}} scholar of medieval astronomy, and improved the designs of several astronomical instruments. Shen is credited with making improved designs of the <b>gnomon,</b> armillary sphere, and clepsydra clock. For the clepsydra he designed a new overflow-tank type, and argued for a more efficient higher-order interpolation instead of linear interpolation in calibrating the measure of time. Improving the 5th century model of the astronomical sighting tube, Shen Kuo widened its diameter so that the new calibration could observe the pole star indefinitely. This came about due {{to the position of}} the pole star shifting in position since the time of Zu Geng in the 5th century, hence Shen Kuo diligently observed the course of the pole star for three months, plotting the data of its course and coming to the conclusion that it had shifted slightly over three degrees. Apparently this astronomical finding had an impact upon the intellectual community in China at the time. Even Shen's political rival and contemporary astronomer Su Song featured Shen's corrected position of the pole star (halfway between Tian shu, at −350 degrees, and the current Polaris) in the fourth star map of his celestial atlas.|$|E
5|$|Intellectual men {{of letters}} like the {{versatile}} Shen Kuo dabbled in subjects {{as diverse as}} mathematics, geography, geology, economics, engineering, medicine, art criticism, archaeology, military strategy, and diplomacy, among others. On a court mission to inspect a frontier region, Shen Kuo once made a raised-relief map of wood and glue-soaked sawdust to show the mountains, roads, rivers, and passes to other officials. He once computed {{the total number of}} possible situations on a game board, another time the longest possible military campaign given the limits of human carriers who would bring their own food and food for other soldiers. Shen Kuo is also noted for improving the designs of the inflow clepsydra clock for a more efficient higher-order interpolation, the armillary sphere, the <b>gnomon,</b> and the astronomical sighting tube; increasing its width for better observation of the pole star and other celestial bodies. Shen Kuo also experimented with camera obscura, only a few decades after the first to do so, Ibn al-Haytham (965–1039).|$|E

50|$|Dials {{often have}} holes along the {{circumference}} of their semicircle. As additional <b>gnomons</b> were needless and these holes are often quite shallow, Cole suggests {{they were used to}} quickly and easily reconstruct the tide dials following a fresh whitewash of the church walls with chalk or lime.|$|R

5|$|Along {{with his}} {{colleague}} Wei Pu in the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo planned to plot out the exact coordinates of planetary and lunar movements by recording their astronomical observations {{three times a}} night for a continuum of five years. The Song astronomers of Shen's day still retained the lunar theory and coordinates of the earlier Yi Xing, which after 350 years had devolved {{into a state of}} considerable error. Shen criticized earlier Chinese astronomers for failing to describe celestial movement in spatial terms, yet he did not attempt to provide any reasoning for the motive power of the planets or other celestial movements. Shen and Wei began astronomical observations for the Moon and planets by plotting their locations three times a night for what should have been five successive years. The officials and astronomers at court were deeply opposed Wei and Shen's work, offended by their insistence that the coordinates of the renowned Yi Xing were inaccurate. They also slandered Wei Pu, out of resentment that a commoner had expertise exceeding theirs. When Wei and Shen made a public demonstration using the <b>gnomon</b> to prove the doubtful wrong, the other ministers reluctantly agreed to correct the lunar and solar errors. Despite this success, they eventually dismissed Wei and Shen's tables of planetary motions. Therefore, only the worst and most obvious planetary errors were corrected, and many inaccuracies remained.|$|E
5|$|Alongside his {{colleague}} Wei Pu, Shen planned {{to map the}} orbital paths of the Moon and the planets in an intensive five-year project involving daily observations, yet this was thwarted by political opponents at court. To aid his work in astronomy, Shen Kuo made improved designs of the armillary sphere, <b>gnomon,</b> sighting tube, and invented {{a new type of}} inflow water clock. Shen Kuo devised a geological hypothesis for land formation (geomorphology), based upon findings of inland marine fossils, knowledge of soil erosion, and the deposition of silt. He also proposed a hypothesis of gradual climate change, after observing ancient petrified bamboos that were preserved underground in a dry northern habitat that would not support bamboo growth in his time. He was the first literary figure in China to mention the use of the drydock to repair boats suspended out of water, and also wrote of the effectiveness of the relatively new invention of the canal pound lock. Although Ibn al-Haytham (965–1039) was the first to describe camera obscura, Shen was the first in China to do so, several decades later. Shen wrote extensively about movable type printing invented by Bi Sheng (990–1051), and because of his written works the legacy of Bi Sheng and the modern understanding of the earliest movable type has been handed down to later generations. Following an old tradition in China, Shen created a raised-relief map while inspecting borderlands. His description of an ancient crossbow mechanism which he himself unearthed proved to be a Jacob's staff, a surveying tool which wasn't known in Europe until described by Levi ben Gerson in 1321.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{earliest}} surviving mathematical treatises of ancient China is the Book on Numbers and Computation (Suan shu shu), part of the Zhangjiashan Han bamboo texts dated 202 to 186 BCE and found in Jiangling County, Hubei. Another mathematical text compiled during the Han was The Arithmetical Classic of the <b>Gnomon</b> and the Circular Paths of Heaven (Zhoubi Suanjing), dated no earlier than the 1st century BCE (from perhaps multiple authors) and contained materials similar to those described by Yang Xiong in 15 BCE, yet the zhoubi school of mathematics was not explicitly mentioned until Cai Yong's (132–192 CE) commentary of 180 CE. A preface {{was added to the}} text by Zhao Shuang 趙爽 in the 3rd century CE. There was also the Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art (Jiuzhang Suanshu); its full title was found on two bronze standard measurers dated 179 CE (with speculation that its material existed in earlier books under different titles) and was provided with detailed commentary by Liu Hui (fl. 3rd century CE) in 263 CE. It is worth noting in this context that many of the documents excavated from Qin and Han sites contain evidence of the practical mathematics used by administrators for inventories and taxes, as well as for calculating labor needed for public works projects, just as described in the mathematical treatises.|$|E
25|$|Perforated <b>gnomons</b> {{projecting}} a pinhole {{image of}} the sun were described in the Chinese Zhoubi Suanjing writings (1046 BCE—256 BCE with material added until circa 220 CE). The location of the bright circle can be measured to tell {{the time of day}} and year. In Arab and European cultures its invention was much later attributed to Egyptian astronomer and mathematician Ibn Yunus around 1000 CE.|$|R
5000|$|The sundials {{described}} above have <b>gnomons</b> that are {{aligned with the}} Earth's rotational axis and cast their shadow onto a plane. If the plane is neither vertical nor horizontal nor equatorial, the sundial {{is said to be}} reclining or inclining. [...] Such a sundial might be located on a South-facing roof, for example. The hour-lines for such a sundial can be calculated by slightly correcting the horizontal formula above ...|$|R
50|$|Horvitz's <b>Gnomons</b> was {{exhibited}} at the New Museum in 2014, featuring four works based {{on the concept of}} time. The final work was a performance piece titled Let us Keep our Own Noon, where volunteers rang brass bells in the streets around the museum at solar noon and then walked away from each other until they could not hear other bells. The piece was performed again in 2016 for the 10th anniversary of “Sequences”, Reykjavík's biennial festival of “real time art”.|$|R

25|$|The Suda relates that Anaximander {{explained}} {{some basic}} notions of geometry. It also mentions {{his interest in}} the measurement of time and associates him with the introduction in Greece of the <b>gnomon.</b> In Lacedaemon, he participated in the construction, or at least in the adjustment, of sundials to indicate solstices and equinoxes. Indeed, a <b>gnomon</b> required adjustments from a place to another because of the difference in latitude.|$|E
25|$|Hipparchus and his {{predecessors}} used various instruments for astronomical calculations and observations, {{such as the}} <b>gnomon,</b> the astrolabe, and the armillary sphere.|$|E
50|$|The {{astronomer}} Yi Xing (683-727) of the Tang Dynasty built 20 standardized <b>gnomons</b> {{spread out}} over China to measure the equation of time dependent on the geographical location. Following a proposition of Liu Zhuo from 604 AD, 10 of these were aligned along the meridian 114° east of Greenwich from Central Asia down to Vietnam {{in order to determine}} the circumference of the Earth and derivations from a perfect sphere. One of these 10 observatories was situated at Gaocheng. The observations were used to establish the Da Yan calendar.|$|R
50|$|The {{observations}} by Timocharis {{are among}} the oldest Greek records that can be assigned a specific date. They are only exceeded by records of the summer solstice of 432 BCE, as noted by Euctemon and Meton. Timocharis worked with Aristillus in an astronomical observatory that was most likely part of the Library of Alexandria. Their equipment would have been simple, most likely consisting of <b>gnomons,</b> sundials and an armillary sphere. The two were contemporaries of Aristarchus of Samos, but {{it is unclear whether}} there was any association between Timocharis and Aristarchus.|$|R
5000|$|A third theory {{comes from}} {{understanding}} of astronomy, geography and paleontology. The mesoamerican calendar probably originated with the Olmecs, and a settlement existed at Izapa, in southeast Chiapas Mexico, before 1200 BCE. There, at a latitude of about 15° N, the Sun passes through zenith twice a year, {{and there are}} 260 days between zenithal passages, and <b>gnomons</b> (used generally for observing {{the path of the}} Sun and in particular zenithal passages), were found at this and other sites. The sacred almanac may well have been set in motion on August 13, 1359 BCE, in Izapa.|$|R
25|$|Around 1575 Italian Dominican priest, mathematician, astronomer, and cosmographer Ignazio Danti {{designed}} a camera obscura gnomom and a meridian {{line for the}} Basilica of Santa Maria Novella, Florence and he later had a massive <b>gnomon</b> built in the San Petronio church in Bologna. The <b>gnomon</b> was used to study {{the movements of the}} sun during the year and helped in determining the new Gregorian calendar for which Danti took place in the commission appointed by Pope Gregorius XIII and instituted in 1582.|$|E
25|$|Strabo {{uses the}} degrees, based on Hipparchus. Neither say that Pytheas did. Nevertheless, Pytheas did obtain latitudes, which, {{according}} to Strabo, he expressed in {{proportions of the}} <b>gnōmōn</b> ("index"), or trigonometric tangents of angles of elevation to celestial bodies. They were measured on the <b>gnōmōn,</b> the vertical leg of a right triangle, and the flat leg of the triangle. The imaginary hypotenuse looked {{along the line of}} sight to the celestial body or marked the edge of a shadow cast by the vertical leg on the horizontal leg.|$|E
25|$|Constructed by the English clock-maker and {{astronomer}} Henry Sully, the <b>gnomon</b> {{was also}} used for various scientific measurements: This rational use may have protected Saint-Sulpice from being destroyed during the French Revolution.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{commonly}} observed sundials {{are those in}} which the shadow-casting style is fixed in position and aligned with the Earth's rotational axis, being oriented with true North and South, and making an angle with the horizontal equal to the geographical latitude. This axis is aligned with the celestial poles, which is closely, but not perfectly, aligned with the (present) pole star Polaris. For illustration, the celestial axis points vertically at the true North Pole, where it points horizontally on the equator. At Jaipur, a famous location for sundials, <b>gnomons</b> are raised 26°55" [...] above horizontal, reflecting the local latitude.|$|R
50|$|The {{mathematical}} {{study of}} figurate numbers {{is said to}} have originated with Pythagoras, possibly based on Babylonian or Egyptian precursors. Generating whichever class of figurate numbers the Pythagoreans studied using <b>gnomons</b> is also attributed to Pythagoras. Unfortunately, there is no trustworthy source for these claims, because all surviving writings about the Pythagoreans are from centuries later. It seems to be certain that the fourth triangular number of ten objects, called tetractys in Greek, was a central part of the Pythagorean religion, along with several other figures also called tetractys. Figurate numbers were a concern of Pythagorean geometry.|$|R

Other mathematical formulae of relevance are briefly discussed. I...|$|R
