When Kecal increases the offer to 300florins, Jeník pretends to accept, but imposes a condition – no one but Mícha's son {{will be allowed to}} wed Mařenka. Kecal agrees, and rushes off to prepare the contract. Alone, Jeník ponders the deal he has apparently made to barter his beloved ("When you discover whom you've bought"), wondering <b>how</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> believe that he would really do this, and finally expressing his love for Mařenka.|$|E

500|$|During {{the early}} twentieth century, Meyerbeer's operas {{gradually}} disappeared from the stage, partly due to their length and expense to mount, partly due to their denigration by supporters of Wagnerian opera.

500|$|As Wagner prospered, {{it became}} second-nature for him, his wife Cosima and the Wagner circle to deprecate Meyerbeer and his works, and Cosima's Diaries contain {{numerous}} instances of this – (as well as recording {{a dream of}} Wagner's in which he and Meyerbeer were reconciled). Wagner's autobiography 'Mein Leben', circulated amongst his friends (and published openly in 1911), contains constant sniping at Meyerbeer and concludes with Wagner receiving the news of Meyerbeer's death, and his companions' gratification at the news. The downgrading of Meyerbeer became a commonplace amongst Wagnerites: in 1898, George Bernard Shaw, in The Perfect Wagnerite, commented that [...] "Nowadays young people cannot understand <b>how</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> have taken Meyerbeer's influence seriously." ...|$|E

That week, there was no number 1 hit in Britain, according to Lydon, et al. in The Filth and The Fury; the top spot was empty, because so many radio stations, the BBC, and individuals protested the song's content. Rotten boasted, [...] "We're the only honest band that's hit this planet in about two thousand million years." [...] Jones shrugged off everything the song stated and implied—or took nihilism to a logical endpoint: [...] "I don't see <b>how</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> describe us as a political band.

I think Larsen has unpleasant surprises in store for , all the more since having dealt with Taimanov thus, Fischer will want to do just the same to Larsen and this is impossible. Fischer beat Larsen by the score of 6–0. Robert Byrne writes: [...] "To a certain extent I could grasp the Taimanov match as a kind of curiosity–almost a freak, a strange chess occurrence that would never occur again. But now I am at a loss for anything whatever to say... So, it is out of the question for me to explain how Bobby, <b>how</b> <b>anyone,</b> <b>could</b> win six games in a row from such a genius of the game as Bent Larsen". Just a year before, Larsen had played first board for the Rest of the World team ahead of Fischer, and had handed Fischer his only loss at the Interzonal. Garry Kasparov later wrote that no player had ever shown a superiority over his rivals comparable to Fischer's [...] "incredible" [...] 12–0 score in the two matches.

2500|$|Some of Gove's {{key points}} were rebuffed by the {{academics}} that Gove {{had used to}} support his thesis. Gove had criticised Cambridge professor Sir Richard Evans saying his views were more like that of an undergraduate cynic in a Footlights review. Instead he urged people to listen to Margaret MacMillan of Oxford University. MacMillan responded, saying: [...] "I agree with some of what Mr Gove says, but he is mistaking myths for rival interpretations of history. I did not say, as Mr Gove suggests, that British soldiers in the First World War were consciously fighting for a western liberal order. They were just defending their homeland and fighting {{what they saw as}} German militarism." [...] Evans said Gove's attack was [...] "ignorant" [...] and asked <b>how</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> possibly say Britons were fighting for freedom given their country's main ally was Tsarist Russia.

[...] Her parents played country music records by Jim Reeves and Don Williams at home and as she got older, her musical interests diversified as she listened to artists like ABBA, Charley Pride, Fleetwood Mac and Marty Stuart among others. The family later moved to Westlock, Alberta and Johnson attended RF Staples High School there. During her high school years, she learned to play the clarinet, flute and saxophone. She kept up her piano lessons largely in part due to Thiessan sending books and encouraging letters to her.

Lawrence Shafer, a guardsman who admitted he fired during the shootings and was one of those indicted in the 1974 federal criminal action with charges subsequently dismissed, told the Kent-Ravenna Record-Courier newspaper in May 2007: [...] "I never heard any command to fire. That's all I can say on that."

50|$|A {{question}} commonly asked {{is whether}} facial expressions within microexpressions are universal {{no matter what}} their background. Charles Darwin wrote that facial expressions of emotion are universal, not learned differently in each culture; that they are biologically determined, the product of man's evolution. Many writers have disagreed with this statement. David Matsumoto however agreed with this statement in his study of sighted and blind Olympians. Using thousands of photographs captured at the 2004 Olympic and Paralympic Games, Matsumoto compared the facial expressions of sighted and blind judo athletes, including individuals who were born blind. All competitors displayed the same expressions in response to winning and losing. Matsumoto discovered that both blind and sighted competitors displayed similar facial expression, during winnings and loss. These results suggest that our ability to modify our faces to fit the social setting is not learned visually. Paul Ekman did research to find out if there were 5 innate facial expressions that are not culturally learned. To do this he had to find an isolated preliterate community to show that the expressions displayed by the people that occupy that area can be interpreted in their expression to the same in <b>how</b> <b>anyone</b> globally <b>could</b> understand implicitly how they were feeling.|$|R

Resigning these luxuries, they will get what in return? They will still have the necessaries of life {{and some of the}} comforts.” In 1903 Price wrote a book called Home Building and Furnishing.
