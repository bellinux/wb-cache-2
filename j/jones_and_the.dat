40|$|A {{lighting}} {{design is}} the result of an artistic process, one that requires hundreds of choices that precede the design's complete realization. The purpose of this thesis is to document, analyze and interpret this lighting design process as it was applied to the University of Maryland Department of Theatre's production of Tom <b>Jones's</b> <b>and</b> Harvey Schmidt's <b>The</b> Fantasticks. In Chapter I it was shown how analyzing the text for thematic ideas and contextualizing its authorship and initial production helped to develop the design's aesthetic approach. Chapter II documents the meetings with <b>the</b> director <b>and</b> production team that helped me to create a specific lighting design concept. In Chapter III the steps necessary to realize the lighting design are described. Chapter IV is an analysis of the design using the conceptual ideas identified in Chapters I and II, as a basis for its evaluation...|$|R

40|$|Radiative {{transfer}} of partially polarized radiation in an anisotropically scattering, inhomogeneous atmosphere containing an arbitrary polydispersion of particles is described using Jones's (1941) amplitude vectors and matrices. This approach exploits the close analogy between the quantum-mechanical states of spin 1 / 2 systems <b>and</b> <b>the</b> polarization states of electromagnetic radiation described by Jones's vector. The complete equivalence between the transport equation for <b>Jones's</b> vectors <b>and</b> <b>the</b> classical radiative-transfer equation for Stokes's intensity vectors is demonstrated in two independent ways after deriving the transport equations for the polarization coherency matrices <b>and</b> for <b>the</b> quaternions {{corresponding to the}} Jones's vectors. A compact-operator formulation of the theory is provided and used to derive the necessary equations for both a local and a global description of the transport of Jones's vectors. The integro-differential equations for <b>the</b> amplitude reflection <b>and</b> transmission matrices are derived <b>and</b> related to <b>the</b> usual corresponding equations...|$|R

50|$|Angela McRobbie {{argued that}} adding the prefix post- to {{feminism}} undermined the strides that feminism made in achieving equality for everyone, including women.

McRobbie believed that postfeminism was most clearly seen on so-called feminist media products, such as Bridget <b>Jones's</b> Diary, Sex <b>and</b> <b>the</b> City, <b>and</b> Ally McBeal. Female characters like Bridget Jones and Carrie Bradshaw claimed to be liberated and clearly enjoy their sexuality, but what they was constantly searching for was the one man who would make everything worthwhile.|$|R

50|$|A Chinese Odyssey Part Three was {{released}} in China amidst the Mid-Autumn Festival from which it benefitted. The film opened Wednesday, September 14 and delivered $6.26 million on its first day. It climbed higher to $13.1 million on Thursday (due largely because the festival fell on this day) and held to $9.61 million on Friday (since Friday was also a holiday), before dropping to $5.71 million on Saturday and finally $2.67 million on Sunday (since work resumed on Sunday). In total, the film made $33.3 million in five days {{according to data from}} Ent Group <b>and</b> $17.3 over <b>the</b> three days of the weekend (Friday to Sunday), according to ComScore easily topping the Chinese box office and recorded an opening nearly double the second place Z Storm 2 if going by the five-day figure.

500|$|Steve Kandell of New York {{magazine}} {{compared it}} to the second season episode [...] "Hunting Trip", but said [...] "Camping" [...] was [...] "somewhat more of a placeholder". Kandell compared the characters' pressure to meet the city's expectations to those the show faces {{now that they have}} been renewed for a fourth season. ChicagoNow writer Andy Daglas called it [...] "a fun episode, but also one that felt like sort of a pause, a chance to reset the pins". He compared the pressure on Leslie {{to come up with an}} idea on the harvest festival to pressure on the show's writing staff to follow up on the harvest festival story arc. The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow called it funny and charming, but also a low point in the season following seven excellent episodes. He said it depended too much on the show's romantic relationships, which he feels are growing stale, although he praised Rashida <b>Jones's</b> performance <b>and</b> <b>the</b> focus on the strong platonic relationship between Leslie and Ron.|$|R
500|$|While police {{questioned}} potential {{suspects and}} witnesses, other investigators focused on processing the crime scene. Repeated {{attempts were made}} to find the bullet that had passed through <b>Jones's</b> body <b>and</b> <b>the</b> murder weapon, including the sifting of dirt at the crime scene for bullets <b>and</b> <b>the</b> deployment of a troop of Boy Scouts to search for a gun. A [...]22 caliber rifle slug was eventually found buried in the ground where Jones's body had been found, providing evidence {{that at least some of}} her wounds had been sustained at the place her body was found. Though investigators went so far as to drag the bottom of nearby bodies of water, the gun that had shot Jones—assumed to be a [...]22 caliber pistol—could not be found. Buildings near where Jones's body had been located were also searched for blood and gunshot evidence, in accordance with police's theory that Jones had been attacked elsewhere and then transported outdoors. A [...] "white, powdery substance" [...] found in Jones's hair was initially believed to a trace evidence of some other crime scene area—an idea which fueled the search of nearby buildings—but was later determined to be fly eggs.|$|R
5|$|After {{the release}} of the game, a story for a {{supposed}} successor in the adventure genre was conceived by Joe Pinney, Hal Barwood, Bill Stoneham, and Aric Wilmunder. Titled Indiana <b>Jones</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Iron Phoenix, it was set after World War II and featured Nazis seeking refuge in Bolivia, trying to resurrect Adolf Hitler with the philosophers' stone.

Because of an approaching hurricane, Spielberg was unable to shoot a fight at a waterfall, so he sent the second unit to film shots of Brazil's and Argentina's Iguazu Falls. These were digitally combined into the fight, which was shot at the Universal backlot.|$|E
5|$|Another {{follow-up}} {{game called}} Indiana <b>Jones</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Spear of Destiny was planned, which {{revolved around the}} Spear of Longinus.

Elaine Lee loosely reworked the story into another four-part comic book series, released from April to July 1995.|$|E
