This may seem absurd to someone looking at a neurosis from the attitude that it is always an illness that should not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> expects the doctor to have a quick cure, and that fantasies are unreliable subjective experiences.|$|E
25|$|CSP message-passing {{fundamentally}} {{involves a}} rendezvous between the {{processes involved in}} sending and receiving the message, i.e. the sender cannot transmit a message until the receiver is ready to accept it. In contrast, message-passing in actor systems is fundamentally asynchronous, i.e. message transmission and reception do not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> at same time, and senders may transmit messages before receivers are ready to accept them. These approaches may be considered duals of each other, {{in the sense that}} rendezvous-based systems can be used to construct buffered communications that behave as asynchronous messaging systems, while asynchronous systems can be used to construct rendezvous-style communications by using a message/acknowledgement protocol to synchronize senders and receivers.|$|E
500|$|The album {{ends with}} [...] "The Tourist", which Jonny Greenwood wrote as an unusually staid piece where {{something}} [...] "doesn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen...</b> every three seconds." [...] He said, [...] "'The Tourist' doesn't sound like Radiohead at all. It {{has become a}} song with space." [...] The lyrics, written by Yorke, were inspired by his experience of watching American tourists in France frantically trying to see as many tourist attractions as possible. He said it {{was chosen as the}} closing track because [...] "a lot of the album was about background noise and everything moving too fast {{and not being able to}} keep up. It was really obvious to have 'Tourist' as the last song. That song was written to me from me, saying, 'Idiot, slow down.' Because at that point, I needed to. So that was the only resolution there could be: to slow down." [...] The [...] "unexpectedly bluesy waltz" [...] draws to a close as the guitars drop out, leaving only drums and bass, and concludes with the sound of a small bell.|$|E

500|$|Author Simon Leng {{has written}} of George Harrison {{experiencing}} an [...] "incredible phase of creativity" [...] throughout 1969, following his {{time spent in}} Woodstock, New York with Bob Dylan and the Band in late 1968. Commentators note that Harrison's growth as a composer would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> almost {{in spite of the}} Beatles, given his customary junior status to bandmates John Lennon and Paul McCartney. The Beatles' Get Back sessions in January 1969 inspired the Harrison songs [...] "I Me Mine" [...] and [...] "Wah-Wah", both of which reflected the fractious situation within the band, and his return to their fold after walking out of these filmed rehearsals allowed him to dictate terms for their immediate future. McCartney and Lennon now looked at Harrison [...] "with new respect", author Alan Clayson suggests. Mersey Beat founding editor Bill Harry was another to notice a change in Harrison compared to earlier in the 1960s, writing: [...] "He wasn't under the domination of the others. He wasn't a passenger any more." [...] An additional factor in Harrison's assuredness was his introduction to the Hare Krishna movement, following a meeting with devotee Shyamasundar Das at Apple Corps headquarters in December 1968.|$|E

Yet some claimed that during an IRC chat in October 2000, a month before he began posting, Titor was asked if the future could be changed from his predictions, and answered [...] "It's too late … I just wish things didn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> the way they will." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the series}} finale, an angelic Baltar and Cylon Number Six are walking down a {{sidewalk}} in modern-day New York City. They are unseen and unheard by the people around them. As the two walk, they notice technologically advanced robots, computers, and other cybernetic devices, and they talk about the technological advancements the humans have made since the Colonists and Humanoid Cylons first arrived to this Earth, over 150,000 years earlier. Cylon Number Six and Baltar have an exchange over one of the ongoing themes from the series, [...] "All of this has happened before. But the question remains, does all of this <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> again?" [...] Consequently, the revelation that Battlestar Galactica takes place in our collective prehistoric past means that unlike most space opera science fiction stories, the series is a fictional tale of ancient history rather than future history and serves as a fictional tale of origin for modern humanity.|$|E

[...] Soon they are joined by the poet Bertram and several ladies of the court. [...] The Illusionist says he will arrange a little private entertainment while they are waiting. [...] As to what they would like to see, everyone is curious to see what will happen when Hans and the embittered Bertha finally meet after avoiding each other for three months. [...] The Illusionist says he can arrange for this event to take place at once. [...] Bertram objects asking, “Why are we doing this evil thing?” [...] The Chamberlain cynically replies, “Sooner or later it would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> [...] That's life.” [...] They all conceal themselves behind a pillar and watch as the inevitable events unfold. [...] Hans and Bertha meet. [...] Bertha manipulates Hans with guilt. [...] The Illusionist gives the spectators a further glimpse into the future showing them the scene when Hans realizes that he married the wrong woman. [...] Bertha intimately knows the Wittenstein family history, she plays the lute, she recites, she illuminates manuscripts—she is the perfect woman. [...] When Bertha asks Hans what Ondine does that might advance her husband's interests at court, he replies, “Oh, she swims. [...] Occasionally.” ...|$|E

There is nowhere they can come in, there is nothing they can do.

6000|$|Good Robert Thompson was {{followed}} by fin M. Lerambert--who was surely good too, in his different way; good at least for feigning an interest he could scarce have rejoicingly felt and that he yet somehow managed to give a due impression of: that artifice being, as we must dimly have divined at the time (in fact I make bold to say that I personally did divine it,) exactly a sign of his finesse. Of no such uncanny engine had Mr. Thompson, luckily, known a need--luckily since to what arsenal could he possibly have resorted for it? None capable of supplying it could ever have met his sight, and we ourselves should at a pinch have had to help him toward it. He was easily interested, or at least took an easy view, on such ground as we offered him, {{of what it was}} to be so; whereas his successor attached to the condition a different value--one recognising no secondary substitute. Perhaps this was why our connection with M. Lerambert can have lasted but four or five months--time even for his sharp subterfuge to have ceased entirely to serve him; though indeed even as I say this I vaguely recall that our separation was attended with friction, that it took him unaware and that he had been prepared (or so represented himself) for further sacrifices. It could have been no great one, assuredly, to deal with so intensely living a young mind as my elder brother's, it could have been but a happy impression constantly renewed; but we two juniors, Wilky and I, were a drag--Wilky's powers most displayed at that time in his preference for ingenuous talk over any other pursuit whatever, and my own aptitude showing for nil, according to our poor gentleman's report of me when a couple of months had sped, save as to rendering La Fontaine's fables into English with a certain corresponding felicity of idiom. I remember perfectly the parental communication to me of this fell judgment, I remember as well the interest with which its so quite definite character inspired me--that character had such beauty and distinctness; yet, and ever so strangely, I recover no sense of having been crushed, and this even though destitute, utterly, of any ground of appeal. The fact leaves me at a loss, since I also remember my not having myself thought particularly well, in the connection allowed, of my [...] "rendering" [...] faculty. [...] "Oh," [...] I seem inwardly to have said, [...] "if it were to be, if it only could be, really a question of rendering--!" [...] and so, without confusion, though in vague, very vague, mystification to have left it: as if so many things, intrinsic and extrinsic, would have to change and operate, so many would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> so much water have to flow under the bridge, before I could give primary application to such a thought, much more finish such a sentence.|$|E
