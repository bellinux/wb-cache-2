5|$|The first {{death on}} Giant Dipper {{occurred}} {{four months after}} it debuted, on September 21. A 15-year-old boy fell from the ride while standing up {{near the end of}} the ride. The <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> was applied, but the boy fell head first onto the track and was crushed by the roller coaster train. Other fatalities also occurred in 1940 and 1970. Several modifications have been made to the trains as a result.|$|E
5|$|On November 17, 1997, {{an empty}} train {{collided}} with another train waiting to depart Union Station with over 800 passengers on board. The empty train's locomotive engineer {{was at the}} opposite end of the train, and the conductor at the leading end failed in his attempts to relay the situation to the engineer or apply the <b>emergency</b> <b>brake.</b> The two trains then collided at a speed of , causing a partial derailment and minor injuries to fifty-four passengers and two crew members. The subsequent Transportation Safety Board report made recommendations, including making emergency brakes more accessible and that the locomotive engineer must always control the train from the leading end in the Union Station Rail Corridor.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB {{investigation}} found {{that after a}} June 17 replacement of a track circuit component at what became {{the site of the}} June 22 collision, the track circuit had been suffering from parasitic oscillations which left it unable to reliably report when that stretch of track was occupied by a train. The struck train came to a stop because of traffic ahead. Because the entire train was within the faulty circuit, it became invisible to the Automatic Train Control (ATC) system. The train behind it was therefore commanded to proceed at 55mph. The operator of the striking train applied the <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> after the stopped train came into full view but there was not enough time to prevent the collision, which occurred at approximately 44mph.|$|E
30|$|The <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> {{warning message}} will {{broadcast}} to the neighbouring cars {{when the car}} speed decreases 0.1  g in 0.1  ms. The first car broadcasts the <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> warning message, and the second car also broadcasts the <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> warning message very soon after. Hence, the third car will receive multiple <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> warning messages. We will show the first car and second car <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> warning individually in the user interface (Figure  8), because our system uses the vehicle list to identify the car information.|$|R
30|$|The main {{contribution}} of the proposed cooperative <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> warning system delivers drivers a braking warning signal earlier by DSRC communication. Via vehicle-to-vehicle communication, the <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> warning signal will be broadcast and the transmission time is much shorter than the human reaction time. Therefore, drivers behind can receive an immediate <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> warning while the front vehicle <b>emergency</b> <b>brakes.</b> Since the transmission time is much shorter than the human reaction time, the driver in car C can {{be aware of the}} <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> of car A before the driver in car B brakes and its braking light comes on, as shown in Figure  4. Consequently, the early warning mechanism is the concept of the proposed cooperative <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> warning system. Now that active safety applications have become mature, cooperative communication technology to achieve improved safety will be the future trend.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2016, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety {{announced}} {{the manufacturers of}} 99% of U.S. automobiles had agreed to include automatic <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> systems as a standard feature on virtually all new cars sold in the U.S. by 2022. [...] In Europe there was a related agreement about advanced <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> system (AEBS) or autonomous <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> (AEB) in 2012. United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) has announced {{that this kind of}} system will become mandatory for new heavy vehicles starting in 2015. NHTSA projected that the ensuing acceleration of the rollout of automatic <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> would prevent an estimated 28,000 collisions and 12,000 injuries.|$|R

25|$|In {{the event}} of a loss of braking due to {{reservoir}} depletion, the engine driver may be able to regain control with an <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> application, as the emergency portion of each car's dual-compartment reservoir should be fully chargedit is not affected by normal service reductions. The triple valves detect an emergency reduction based on the rate of brake pipe pressure reduction. Therefore, as long as a sufficient volume of air can be rapidly vented from the brake pipe, each car's triple valve will cause an <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> application. However, if the brake pipe pressure is too low due to an excessive number of brake applications, an emergency application will not produce a large enough volume of air flow to trip the triple valves, leaving the engine driver with no means to stop the train.|$|E
25|$|Since initial {{widespread}} use in production cars, anti-lock braking {{systems have been}} improved considerably. Recent versions not only prevent wheel lock under braking, but also electronically control the front-to-rear brake bias. This function, depending on its specific capabilities and implementation, is known as electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD), traction control system, <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> assist, or electronic stability control (ESC).|$|E
25|$|An <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> {{consisting}} {{of a piece of}} steel, around 1.5 inches thick and 18 inches long, which hangs under the car and is pushed into the track slot (the opening through which the grip reaches the cable) when the gripman pulls a lever. It wedges tightly into the slot and often has to be removed with a welding torch.|$|E
2500|$|The {{red line}} in the figure shows the [...] "monitoring speed", which is the speed which, if exceeded, the train will {{automatically}} apply the <b>emergency</b> <b>brakes.</b> When running at constant speed this is [...] above the permitted speed for transited <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> (until speed is reduced) or [...] above the permitted speed for continuous <b>emergency</b> <b>braking.</b> When approaching a stopping point, the monitoring speed follows a braking curve similar to the permitted speed, but with a higher deceleration, that will bring it to zero at the stopping point. When approaching a speed restriction, the monitoring speed braking curve intersects the speed restriction point at [...] above the constant speed.|$|R

25|$|The first 800 {{units were}} sent in reverse with a lever; all units after that were sent in reverse with a pedal between the clutch and brake pedals. The middle pedal {{was used to}} engage reverse gear when the car was in neutral. The right pedal {{operated}} the transmission brake – there were no brakes on the wheels. The floor lever also controlled the parking brake, which was activated by pulling the lever all the way back. This doubled as an <b>emergency</b> <b>brake.</b>|$|E
25|$|Passenger safety {{instructions}} are inside train carriages above {{the doors and}} stations at ticket hall and platforms. These instructions direct passengers to use emergency phones and also include an emergency phone number to traffic center. There is emergency-stop handles at platforms, which are used to stop the train either arriving or departing in cases such as person trapped between doors, or person fallen onto track. There are <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> handles inside the carriage {{next to the door}} and at both ends of carriage.|$|E
25|$|The trams had {{a primary}} dynamic braking {{controlled}} through 12 stages. There are also pnumatic drum brakes, {{although they are}} only used for parking, braking form the back end and for a passenger-induced <b>emergency</b> <b>brake.</b> The MO units were instead equipped with clasp brakes controlled by pneumatics. Trailers were equipped with solenoid brakes, but lacked a parking brake as {{it was found that}} the motor unit's holding brake was sufficient., In addition all units had an emergency rail brake. The trams were connected with Albert couplers.|$|E
40|$|The <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> {{distance}} of the present Shinkansen is just under 4, 000 m (E 2 series at 275 km/h). If increasing initial braking speed to 360 km/h while leaving the braking performance as-is, the <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> distance will extend to as long as approx. 7, 000 m. But {{the analysis of the}} risk increase in case of earthquake due to Shinkansen speed increases indicates that {{the most effective way to}} control that risk is to keep the <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> distance from becoming longer as much as possible. Accordingly, we decided to develop a brake system to deal with speed increase in the FASTECH project, aiming for an approx. 4, 000 m <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> distance at 360 km/h. To achieve that rapid deceleration that the present Shinkansen does not require, we developed basic brake equipment that has the braking force required for that and a brake control method that makes full use of the adhesion between wheels and rails. Apart from brake equipment, we also develope...|$|R

25|$|Tests {{showed no}} {{signalling}} equipment faults and {{the report was}} able to dismiss {{the possibility that the}} signalman had only changed the route after the Perth train had passed the caution signal. The driver of the Perth train had not slowed his train in response to this signal and had then passed two danger signals before colliding with the Tring train. All the evidence suggested that the driver had made no attempt to stop until the very last moment: Eyewitnesses on board the Perth train reported that an <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> application was made a few seconds before the collision.|$|E
25|$|In April 2015, two STT Security officers, James Finnerty and Marius Beniusis, were hospitalized after {{intervening}} in the stabbing {{of a man}} at the Milltown Luas stop. The officers noticed a confrontation on the platform from a tram leaving the stop and used the <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> to stop and disembark the tram. Neither officer noticed the presence of weapons and were sprayed with pepper spray as they approached. Beniusis received a serious stab wound to his leg as they attempted to restrain the assailants. The victim suffered serious stab wounds to the neck, back and leg and required approximately fifty stitches. Several other men fled the scene, but Finnerty and Beniusis detained two suspects until the arrival of Gardaí.|$|E
25|$|The first Chicken, no. 33, was {{met with}} dissatisfaction by the employees. They were built without air brakes, which meant that the {{conductor}} would have to traverse a full tram to reach the <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> should the motorman fall unconscious. The railway authorities sided with the employees, requiring the company to rebuild the unit. A similar concern was raised concerning the trailers. As air brakes are fail safe, the trailers would automatically brake should the trailer become disconnected. With the need for pressurized air system in place, the advantages of pneumatic door were reaped. However, the pneumatics systems largely ate up the costs savings of rebuilding material. Most of the work was carried out at Sagene Depot, and was carried out between mid-1954 to 1958.|$|E
