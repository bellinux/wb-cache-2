While the state ranked eighth for installed wind energy capacity in 2011, it <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of states in usage of renewable energy, with 94 percent of its electricity being generated by non-renewable sources in 2009, including 25 percent from coal and 46 percent from natural gas. Oklahoma has no nuclear power. Ranking 13th for total energy consumption per capita in 2009, Oklahoma's energy costs were 8th lowest in the nation.|$|E

Woody leaves a note for Andy, who, thinking the note is from his mother, takes the toys to Bonnie's house, and introduces her to them. Bonnie recognizes Woody, who, to Andy's surprise, <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the box. Though hesitant at first, Andy passes Woody on to Bonnie, and then plays with her before leaving. Woody and the other toys witness Andy's departure as they begin their new lives with Bonnie.

The ticket office exists within the small concourse. This concourse gives direct access, down the ramp, to the intercity platforms 3 and 4. There are footbridges {{on either side of}} this ramp to all other platforms. The eastern footbridge ends at an alternative {{entrance to the}} station on Butler Street, giving closer access to Preston city centre and the station car park. There also exists a subway which provides step-free access to all eight platforms in use at the station and with platform 7, {{at the south end of}} which is another entrance serving the station car park.|$|E

5|$|Near {{the end of}} the year, Harry and Dumbledore {{journey to}} a cave to {{retrieve}} a suspected Horcrux, Slytherin's locket. Dumbledore expertly finds a secret passageway to a large, pitch black underground lake, which Harry and Dumbledore cross in a small boat to an island in the centre. The locket <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of a basin and can only be reached by drinking the potion above it. Harry helps Dumbledore, who drinks the potion, and though Dumbledore is severely weakened, together they manage to fight off Voldemort's Inferi that have been hiding in the lake. They take the locket and return to find that the Dark Mark has been placed over the highest tower in Hogwarts in their absence. Harry and Dumbledore ascend the tower where they are ambushed by Draco Malfoy, accompanied by Death Eaters that he helped get inside Hogwarts. Dumbledore freezes Harry under his Invisibility Cloak with a body-bind spell to keep him hidden. Draco disarms Dumbledore of his wand and then threatens to kill him, which turns out to have been his mission from Voldemort. Draco is unable to go through with it, and Snape arrives and casts the spell to kill Dumbledore instead. Harry ignores the battle raging in Hogwarts to pursue Dumbledore's killer. Snape successfully fights Harry off, and he reveals that he is in fact the Half-Blood Prince before he, Draco, {{and the rest of the}} Death Eaters escape.|$|E

Soon after, radiation equivalent dose rates had risen to 8.2 mSv/h around two hours after the explosion and again down to 2.4 mSv/h, shortly after. Three hours after the explosion, the rates had risen to 11.9 mSv/h.|$|E

25|$|Once {{the bell}} {{is at the}} correct depth, the final {{adjustments}} to pressure are made and after final checks, the supervisor instructs the working diver(s) to lock out of the bell. The hatch <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the bell and can only be opened if the pressure inside is balanced with the ambient water pressure. The bellman tends the working diver's umbilical through the hatch during the dive. If the diver experiences a problem and needs assistance, the bellman will exit the bell and follow the diver's umbilical to the diver and render whatever help is necessary and possible. Each diver carries back-mounted bailout gas, which should be sufficient to allow a safe return to the bell {{in the event of}} an umbilical gas supply failure.|$|E
25|$|R. romandi nests {{are often}} built under the eaves of buildings. When built {{on such a}} hard surface, the nest, entirely covered by an envelope, forms a {{compressed}} hemisphere with multiple horizontal, flat combs, the largest comb being near the bottom. These combs are connected to each other within the envelope by ribbon-like pedicles. Cells are hexagonal and regularly arranged. The envelope is mostly single layered, however it can be double layered in parts. It is made of plant fibers and fragments and is a uniform light gray color. It is possible for the envelope to be heavily coated in saliva {{to the extent that}} the fibrous material of the envelope itself is completely hidden. A round entrance hole <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the hemispherical nest.|$|E
25|$|On 12 May, TEPCO {{engineers}} {{confirmed that}} a meltdown occurred, with molten fuel having {{fallen to the}} bottom of the reactor's pressure vessel, or RPV. The utility said that fuel rods of the No. 1 reactor are fully exposed, with the water level 1meter (3.3feet) below the base of the fuel assembly. According to a Japanese press report, there are holes in the base of the pressure vessel – these holes were meant for the control-rods. After the fuel had melted, it produced holes in the bottom of the RPV, and then escaped into the containment vessel. In November 2011 TEPCO did not know the shape or porosity of the fuel mass, which <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the containment vessel. As a result, it is impossible to know exactly how far the fuel mass would have eroded the concrete floor, but TEPCO estimate that no more than 70cm of a 7.6meter concrete slab was eroded away by the hot fuel. The production of heat and steam in unit 1 has decreased, as suggested by both radioactive decay calculations and photographic evidence (same source from TEPCO).|$|E
