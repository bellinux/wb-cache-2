In the second text scene of the emaki, Murasaki Shikibu describes how everybody including servants, minor officials and <b>high</b> <b>nobility</b> was joyful and happy.

25|$|A {{minority}} of all nobility belonged to an informal circle of <b>high</b> <b>nobility,</b> measured by wealth, High Councillorships {{held by the}} family, and impressive medieval ancestors. Lower nobility was a larger group, clearly lower in terms of wealth, position and respect from social, economic and political regard. Generally, their members made cavalry service on behalf of one farm, or just a few in maximum. There was {{only a fraction of}} tax-exempted noble land in Finland compared with its proportion in Sweden proper. The Swedish manors were much concentrated in hands of families of <b>high</b> <b>nobility.</b> In Finland, as the contrary case, the nobility was generally so-called soldier nobility, {{and the vast majority of}} Finnish noble families had only one or at most, a few of manors, and mostly were regarded as lower nobility.|$|E

However, the name of Brazil was never changed to Viceroyalty of Brazil. That title, although sometimes used by modern writers, is not proper, as the colony continued to be titled State of Brazil.|$|E

25|$|Nobility's marriages became restricted: generally, only a noblewoman was {{eligible}} for valid marriage of a nobleman {{in order to}} transmit the noble status to children. Because before 17th-century mass ennoblements, the number of nobles was actually only in hundreds, daughters of lower nobility became more often brides for wealthy Swedish noble families and even for magnate families. This was one of reasons why many Swedish family of <b>high</b> <b>nobility</b> got also one or more Finnish foremothers (a phenomenon very rare in medieval centuries when already geography {{was a sort of}} obstacle). Finnish nobles very often moved {{to other parts of the}} realm, to have an office in military or in government.|$|E

From the second marriage, Richard had a daughter, but she died as an infant.|$|E
25|$|The Ottoman {{conquest of}} Bosnia marked {{a new era}} in the country's history and {{introduced}} tremendous changes in the political and cultural landscape of the region. Although the kingdom had been crushed and its <b>high</b> <b>nobility</b> executed, the Ottomans nonetheless allowed for the preservation of Bosnia's identity by incorporating it as an integral province of the Ottoman Empire with its historical name and territorial integrity - a unique case among subjugated states in the Balkans. Within this sandžak (and eventual vilayet) of Bosnia, the Ottomans introduced a number of key changes in the territory's socio-political administration; including a new landholding system, a reorganization of administrative units, and a complex system of social differentiation by class and religious affiliation.|$|E

25|$|The most {{outstanding}} exponent of the Catholic renewal was Péter Pázmány, archbishop of Esztergom (16161637). He wrote influential polemical tracts {{characterized by the}} robust freshness of his style {{that contributed to the}} standardization of the Hungarian language. He founded a university at Nagyszombat in 1635 from which Jesuit missionaries could carry on their activities throughout Royal Hungary. The archbishop and the Jesuits managed to persuade more and more members of the <b>high</b> <b>nobility,</b> among them members of the Zrinyi, Batthyány, and Wesselényi families to join Catholicism. The example of the magnates was followed by numerous other noblemen, thus at the Diet of 1638 the majority of the deputies representing the counties was already Catholic.|$|E
25|$|The Low Countries have a {{particular}} history of religious conflict with roots in the Calvinist reformation movement of the 1530s. These conflicts {{became known as the}} Dutch Revolt or the Eighty Years' War. By dynastic inheritance the whole of the Netherlands (the modern day Netherlands and Belgium) had come to be ruled by the kings of Spain. Following aggressive Calvinist preaching in and around the rich merchant cities of the southern Netherlands, organized anti-catholic religious protests grew in violence and frequency. In 1566, a league of about 400 members of the <b>high</b> <b>nobility,</b> themselves disgruntled at Spanish rule, presented a petition to the governor Margaret of Parma to suspend punitive actions against the Calvinists.|$|E
25|$|The merchants of Lisbon allied {{themselves}} with the lower and the middle Portuguese nobility and entreated the Duke of Braganza to accept the throne. According to some historians he was really as indifferent as he seemed {{and it was the}} ambition of his wife and of his allies that made him king. Some of them assert as well that the duke was hesitant because he, {{like the rest of the}} <b>high</b> <b>nobility,</b> benefited by Madrid's rule, but that the prospect of becoming king finally persuaded him. In any event, on 1 December 1640, the conspirators assailed the royal palace and the citadel of Lisbon, and meeting little resistance, acclaimed the duke as the new King of Portugal, John IV (João IV).|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis is to examine whether the second war of {{independence}} from 1332 - 41 was a ‘national’ war or simply a series of regional conflicts. Three separate but overlapping influences are examined: national identity, {{the extent to which}} the different regions of Scotland were drawn in, and the landed interests involved in each region. These three issues are considered for the first time using a prosophographical approach, examining the background and actions of the key players in the conflict, the <b>higher</b> <b>nobility</b> of Scotland. The thesis examines, first of all, the role of the <b>higher</b> <b>nobility</b> of Scotland in the 1330 s. It then looks at each of the recognisable regions of the country in turn, considering who the key members of the <b>higher</b> <b>nobility</b> were in each region, what their interests were and to what extent they were involved in the region. Finally it looks at the motivations of these individuals, primarily from the perspective of national identity, or perhaps more accurately, regnal solidarity. Its conclusion is that the second war of independence was indeed a national war, centred as it was on the interests of the kingdom as a national entity but that other factors – the legitimacy of the Bruce and Balliol claims, the influence of family allegiances through marriage, the personal safety of the members of the <b>higher</b> <b>nobility,</b> the threat of forfeiture and their personal ambitions - were also at work...|$|R
