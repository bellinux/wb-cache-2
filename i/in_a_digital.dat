5|$|Panavision 3D was {{a system}} for {{presenting}} 3-D film <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>digital</b> cinema. It was a passive stereoscopic 3D system that utilized spectral comb filters produced using thin-film optics technology. In such systems, the visible spectrum is broken into alternate bands of light that evenly span the entire visible spectrum.|$|E
5|$|Communications signals {{can be sent}} {{either by}} analog signals or digital signals. There are analog {{communication}} systems and digital communication systems. For an analog signal, the signal is varied continuously {{with respect to the}} information. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>digital</b> signal, the information is encoded as a set of discrete values (for example, a set of ones and zeros). During the propagation and reception, the information contained in analog signals will inevitably be degraded by undesirable physical noise. (The output of a transmitter is noise-free for all practical purposes.) Commonly, the noise in a communication system can be expressed as adding or subtracting from the desirable signal in a completely random way. This form of noise is called additive noise, with the understanding that the noise can be negative or positive at different instants of time. Noise that is not additive noise is a much more difficult situation to describe or analyze, and these other kinds of noise will be omitted here.|$|E

25|$|The {{software}} distribution {{of a product}} can be done offline as well as online. In an offline situation the package is a physical package which contains all the elements. The software is stored on a data carrier such as a CD or a DVD, and the documents might also be stored <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>digital</b> form on this data carrier, or they might be in physical form such as a booklet. The package {{as a whole is}} a physical product. In an online situation the entire package needs to be <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>digital</b> form. The consequences on the distribution process are described in the following paragraphs. CCU is designed to fit both situations but as bandwidth is growing it is making more sense to distribute especially updates and new versions to existing customers online. In this article both ways are discussed. In the process-data model it is assumed that the software vendor conducts both distribution channels. As a practical example: HISComp, a provider of medical information systems distributes its software straightforward via CDs. However they use their website to distribute patches for the software products.|$|E
25|$|The two-element Boolean algebra is {{also used}} for circuit design in {{electrical}} engineering; here 0 and 1 represent the two different states of one bit <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>digital</b> circuit, typically high and low voltage.

Furthermore, every possible input-output behavior can be modeled by a suitable Boolean expression.|$|E
