25|$|Mosaic {{is the art}} {{of decorating}} solid {{surfaces}} with pieces of multi-coloured stone or glass set in mortar. Golden mosaic can be created by applying gold leaf to a single surface of a transparent <b>glass</b> <b>tile,</b> and placing the gilt inwards towards the mortar so that it is visible but cannot be scraped. The gilt tiles are often used as a background to figures, giving a glowing and sumptuous effect. Mosaic can be applied equally well to flat or curved surfaces and is often used to decorate vaults and domes. In churches where mosaic is applied extensively, it gives an impression that the interior of the church has been spread with a blanket of pictures and patterns.|$|E

Albert Solon and Frank Schemmel came to Hearst Castle to perform the tile work.
