The group informed as Escalante that they believed [...] "someone's bootlegging it," [...] and requested his legal help to stop Secor. In exchange for legal fees, Blink-182 would allow Escalante's label, Kung Fu, to re-release Buddha on compact disc. The band had told Secor to not sell any more copies of the tape, but they held suspicions that he had anyway. Anonymously, Escalante ordered a tape from Secor, and Secor sold it to him. The band asserted {{that they were not}} receiving royalties for these sales. [...] "I paid off all of the royalties for the remaining stash of tapes that I had of Buddha," [...] said Secor in 2001. [...] "It was about 25. The tapes sold for <b>five</b> <b>bucks,</b> and I gave them half of what their profit would be. I wanted to have a few to give to people and to have on hand."

[...] Billboard wrote a positive review, stating that [...] "...while it all {{may be a bit}} unpredictable, and may be a longshot to do much in the U.S. market, it is an excellent LP." [...] The album was also placed in Circus magazine's section for [...] "Picks of the Month". Cynthia Dagnal of Rolling Stone wrote an article on Eno, calling the album [...] "a very compelling experiment in controlled chaos and by his own self-dictated standards a near success."

40|$|This study investigates how value {{recovery}} and production control {{are affected by}} the measurement techniques used in bucking and log sorting. The study was approached using simulation techniques. A database of 48 well-described young softwood stems (Pinus sylvestris L.) served as the wood supply, and a sawmill simulator able to read and process the stems was used to predict the outcome of the sawing process In the simulations, <b>five</b> <b>bucking</b> alternatives and three log-sorting alternatives were evaluated.

Results also indicate that the more process stations involved in production control, the better the demand targets are met (the degree of apportionment), but the lower the value and volume recovery become.

Fu Nan led with nine assists. Fuao did improve in the short handed goals department. They gave up the most of any team, but managed to score six during the season which put them ahead of the Nikko Ice Bucks who only scored three.
