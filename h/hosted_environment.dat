50|$|An {{analogue}} {{concept to}} SDP {{found in the}} realm of SOA is that of Web Service Ecosystem (also known as Web Service Marketplace) and the SaaS platform. A Web Service Ecosystem is a <b>hosted</b> <b>environment</b> in which participants expose their services using common Web technologies such as HTTP, XML, SOAP and REST. This <b>hosted</b> <b>environment</b> provides a number of service delivery components covering aspects such as authentication, identity management, usage metering and analytics, content adaptation, data format conversion, charging and payment. This enables service providers to focus on their core functionality and to outsource the service delivery to third parties. Services deployed over Web Service Ecosystems may be business-critical, but they typically do not have the real-time and high-performance requirements associated to telecommunications services for which SDPs are traditionally conceived. They usually support common business functions such as quoting, order management, marketing campaign management or customer care. SOA {{can also be used to}} standardize operational processes and re-use them across SDPs.|$|E

30|$|One of the {{advantages}} pursued for native environments is avoiding data copies, by sending pointers to data through channels in a shared address space. But we learned using the <b>hosted</b> <b>environment</b> that, in many cases, it is desirable to actually copy the data before sending it to the another process. The {{reason is that the}} sender usually modifies the data received before sending it, and making a copy is necessary to avoid race conditions. Also, copying is necessary on hosted environments because data goes through external (software) devices provided by the underlying system.|$|E
40|$|An {{implementation}} translates C source {{files and}} executes C programs in two data-processing-system environ-ments, {{which will be}} called the translation environment and the execution environment in this International Standard. environment execution diagnostic shall produce Commentary For a hosted implementation the two environments are often the same. In some cases application developers do cross-translate from one <b>hosted</b> <b>environment</b> to another <b>hosted</b> <b>environment.</b> In a freestanding environment, the two environments are very unlikely to be the same. A commonly used term for the execution environment is runtime system. In some cases this terminology refers to a more restricted set of functionality than a complete execution environment. The requirement on when a diagnostic message must be produced prevents a program from being translated from the source code, on the fly, as statements to execute are encountered. 104 Rationale Because C has seen widespread use as a cross-compiled cross-compilation language, a clear distinction must be made between translation and execution environments. The C 89 preprocessor, for instance, is permitted to evaluate the expression in a #if directive using the long integer or unsigned long integer arithmetic native to the translation environment: these integers must comprise at least 32 bits, but need not match the number of bits in the execution environment. In C 99, this arithmetic must be done in intmax_t or uintmax_t, which must comprise at least 64 bits and must match the execution environment. Other translation time arithmetic, however, such as type casting and floating point arithmetic, must more closely model the execution environment regardless of translation environment...|$|E

40|$|Authenticating users across {{organizational}} boundaries presents {{institutions such}} as libraries with security and other challenges that prevent seamless access and impede customer service. RMIT University Library was amongst the first libraries in Australia to implement stand-alone interlibrary loan management systems. At RMIT the VDX system was installed to run the Library’s Document Delivery service, operating in a shared <b>hosted</b> <b>environment,</b> managed and maintained offsite. Single sign-on was a goal in place for all services and applications at the University but for the VDX service, operating remotely from the institution, authentication ensuring protection of users ’ privacy was a real issue.

This paper examines the Shibboleth implementation from conception and planning to set up, testing and production. Difficulties encountered are outlined as are other Shibboleth implementations and library ILL authentication st rategies. It is of note that RMIT University’s implementation of the full features of Shibboleth is a first for VDX worldwide. 1.
