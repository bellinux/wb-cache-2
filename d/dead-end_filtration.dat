50|$|In {{chemical}} engineering, {{biochemical engineering}} and protein purification, crossflow filtration (also known as tangential flow filtration) {{is a type}} of filtration (a particular unit operation). Crossflow filtration is different from <b>dead-end</b> <b>filtration</b> in which the feed is passed through a membrane or bed, the solids being trapped in the filter and the filtrate being released at the other end. Cross-flow filtration gets its name because the majority of the feed flow travels tangentially {{across the surface of the}} filter, rather than into the filter. The principal advantage of this is that the filter cake (which can blind the filter) is substantially washed away during the filtration process, increasing the length of time that a filter unit can be operational. It can be a continuous process, unlike batch-wise <b>dead-end</b> <b>filtration.</b>|$|E

50|$|This type of {{filtration}} {{is typically}} selected for feeds containing {{a high proportion}} of small particle size solids (where the permeate is of most value) because solid material can quickly block (blind) the filter surface with <b>dead-end</b> <b>filtration.</b> Industrial examples of this include the extraction of soluble antibiotics from fermentation liquors.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMicrofiltration (0, 1 μm) {{was used}} to {{fractionate}} casein (d 50, 3 = 180 nm) micelles from whey proteins (2 - 6 nm). The casein fraction forms a deposited layer on the membrane surface. Little {{is known about the}} structure of these layers and how transmembrane pressure affects their structure. In order to assess the properties, casein micelle deposits were characterized by dead-end microfiltrations. Casein micelle deposits of constant composition were formed following a standardized layer build up (permeate mass, pressure, pH). Then protein free milk serum was filtered through the deposit. Thus, the impact of compressive forces and protein-protein interactions on physical cake properties during constant solid height filtrations could be determined by stepwise variations of transmembrane pressure and pH without further deposition of proteins. It was found that the casein micelle deposits became more compactable, when their surface charge was lower. Specific cake properties were related to hydrophilic repulsion between casein micelles, whereas the influence of electrostatic interactions between micelles was negligible. The observed cake material properties obtained from <b>dead-end</b> <b>filtrations</b> provide valuable insights into deposit layer build-up and structure. Results obtained for <b>dead-end</b> <b>filtrations</b> were used to describe cross-flow filtrations. For this purpose a new method was developed to assess the specific cake resistances by the evaluation of the kinetic of flux decrease due to deposit layer build-up at the start of filtrations. For the first time it could be shown that deposits consisting of casein micelles during cross-flow filtration were thin layers (1 - 3 μm), resulting in high specific resistances (up to 20 • 10 - 15 m/kg). The specific cake resistance was pressure dependent and increased when the hydrophilic repulsion between casein micelles was reduced at a pH beyond the isoelectric point...|$|R

50|$|There are {{two main}} flow {{configurations}} of membrane processes: cross-flow (or) tangential flow and dead-end filtrations. In cross-flow filtration the feed flow is tangential {{to the surface of}} membrane, retentate is removed from the same side further downstream, whereas the permeate flow is tracked on the other side. In <b>dead-end</b> <b>filtration</b> the direction of the fluid flow is normal to the membrane surface. Both flow geometries offer some advantages and disadvantages. Generally, <b>dead-end</b> <b>filtration</b> is used for feasibility studies on a laboratory scale. The dead-end membranes are relatively easy to fabricate which reduces the cost of the separation process. The dead-end membrane separation process is easy to implement and the process is usually cheaper than cross-flow membrane filtration. The <b>dead-end</b> <b>filtration</b> process is usually a batch-type process, where the filtering solution is loaded (or slowly fed) into the membrane device, which then allows passage of some particles subject to the driving force. The main disadvantage of a dead end filtration is the extensive membrane fouling and concentration polarization. The fouling is usually induced faster at higher driving forces. Membrane fouling and particle retention in a feed solution also builds up a concentration gradients and particle back flow (concentration polarization). The tangential flow devices are more cost and labor-intensive, but they are less susceptible to fouling due to the sweeping effects and high shear rates of the passing flow. The most commonly used synthetic membrane devices (modules) are flat sheets/plates, spiral wounds, and hollow fibers.|$|E

In this research, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) were used together with graphene to create graphene based polymer composite conductive membrane. First, Boehm titration {{was used to determine}} the linkage of carboxyl groups on the surface of graphene sheet. Then pure PVDF membrane was trail-produced to investigate the best ratio of PVDF, plasticizer, and solvent. Results showed that PVDF amount should not be higher than 15 % by weight. In addition, the breaking stain and the contact angle increased with increasing plasticizer concentration; whereas the ultimate force decreased. The resistance of PVDF-graphene membrane was measured. Results showed that although the whole membrane became conductive, the resistance was not less than 8000 ohm. PVA-graphene membrane was prepared. This membrane had much lower resistance than the PVDF-graphene membrane. However, PVA-graphene had a bad performance in perchlorate adsorption due to lack of inside area.

Dead-end configurations are more suited to batch processes with low suspended solids as solids accumulate at the membrane surface therefore requiring frequent backflushes and cleaning to maintain high flux.

50|$|Electrofiltration is a {{technique}} for separation and concentration of colloidal substances - for instance biopolymers. The principle of electrofiltration is based on overlaying electric field on a standard <b>dead-end</b> <b>filtration.</b> Thus the created polarity facilitates electrophoretic force which is opposite to the resistance force of the filtrate flow and directs the charged biopolymers. This provides extreme decrease in the film formation on the micro- or ultra-filtration membranes and the reduction of filtration time from several hours by standard filtration to a few minutes by electrofiltration. In comparison to cross-flow filtration electrofiltration exhibits not only increased permeate flow but also guarantees reduced shear force stress which qualifies it as particularly mild technique for separation of biopolymers that are usually unstable.|$|E

A previous investigation showed that separation by ultrafiltration is possible, but the flux was low due to the high viscosity of the solution and the presence of gel-forming substances in the solution. In this investigation the influence of prefiltration on solution viscosity and ultrafiltration performance was investigated. The viscosity of the hemicellulose solution after extraction was considerably reduced with both prefiltration methods tested, leading to a substantial increase in flux during ultrafiltration. The highest flux achieved without pretreatment was about 75 l/m 2 h, and was increased to 225 and 440 l/m 2 h after <b>dead-end</b> <b>filtration</b> and microfiltration, respectively. However, the loss of hemicelluloses was considerable during microfiltration, but < 5 % during <b>dead-end</b> <b>filtration.</b> After prefiltration by <b>dead-end</b> <b>filtration,</b> hemicelluloses could be successfully concentrated and purified by ultrafiltration.

However, compared to strategies with a non-decreasing pressure and non-increasing flux, the relative savings are small.

Commonly, the critical flux separates operating conditions leading to irreversible fouling to others allowing to work with no (or very low) fouling. The presentation will give a summary of physical causes for critical flux, will propose a way to depict membrane transfer phenomena from these causes, and then will detail consequences on critical fouling conditions both in cross-flow and in <b>dead-end</b> <b>filtration.</b> Physical causes can be seen through a phase diagram for a colloidal suspension where it appears an irreversible phase transition between a dispersed phase and an aggregated phase when increasing volume fraction. This transition, which can be explained when considering multi-body particles interactions, {{seems to be the}} physical causes for a phase change on the membrane surface corresponding to irreversible fouling layers : the term “critical” has here then its physical significance. A way to depict consequences of this phase transition on membrane transfer phenomena is proposed through the use of colloidal osmotic pressure, 0. Colloid osmotic pressure allows describing the phase transition (which is related to a maximum of 0 versus volume fraction curve) as well as transfer phenomena through a collective diffusion (which is related to the derivative of 0 with volume fraction). Consequences on fouling can be deduced from classical mass balance based on the colloidal osmotic pressure by defining critical Péclet numbers both for cross-flow and <b>dead-end</b> <b>filtration.</b> These critical Pe number allows then to define a critical flux in cross flow filtration and a critical filtered volume in <b>dead-end</b> <b>filtration</b> leading to the formation of an irreversible fouling on the membrane surface.

The existence of the CFV is demonstrated when filtering stable latex or clay suspensions in constant-flux filtration experiments with alternating rinses: in contradiction to the current view, an irreversible deposit is not formed as soon as <b>dead-end</b> <b>filtration</b> begins.

Analyses of results are made by depicting the transition between concentration polarisation and deposit formation considering a critical osmotic pressure which appears to be a characteristic of the fouling potential of a suspension.

In the presence of charged organic solutes, inorganic salt retention would decline, even negative retention of monovalent salt was found.

The coupled free/porous fluid transport phenomenon plays an equally important role along with the particle transport mechanisms concerning the separation efficiency of cross-flow membrane filtration. To provide a theoretical background for the experimental outcomes of cross-flow filtration, a mathematically sound model is desired which can reliably represent the interfacial boundary whilst maintaining the continuity of flow field variables across the interface between the free and porous flow regimes. Notwithstanding the numerous attempts reported in the literature, the development of a generic mathematical model for coupled flows has been prohibited by the complexities of interactions between the free and the porous flow systems. Henceforth, the aim of present work is to gain a better mathematical understanding of the interfacial phenomena encountered in coupled free and porous flow regimes applicable to cross-flow filtration systems. The free flow dynamics can be justifiably represented by the Stokes equation whereas the non-isothermal, non-inertial and incompressible flow in a low permeability porous medium can be handled by the Darcy equation. Solutions to the system of partial differential equations (PDE’s) are obtained using the finite element method employing mixed interpolations for the primary field variables which are velocity and pressure. A nodal replacement scheme previously developed by the same authors has been effectively enforced as the boundary constraint at the free-porous interface for coupling the two physically different flow regimes in a single mathematical model. A series of computational experiments for permeability values of the porous medium ranging between 10 - 6 - 10 - 12 m 2 have been performed to examine the susceptibility of the developed model towards complex and irregular shaped geometries. Our results indicate that at high permeability values, the discrepancy in mass balance calculations is observed to be significant for a curved porous surface, which may be attributed to the inability of the Darcy equation to represent the flow dynamics in a highly permeable medium. At a low permeability, a very small amount of fluid permeated through the free/porous interface as most of the fluid leaves the domain through the free flow exit. The geometry and permeability of the free/porous interface are found to affect the amount of fluid passing through the porous medium significantly. All the numerical solutions that are presented have been theoretically validated for their accuracy by computing the overall mass continuity across the computational domains...|$|R

This short-interval back-flush technique, preceded by cross-flow forward flush, was evaluated {{as an alternative to}} conventional back-flush to maintain membrane flux productivity in a pilot <b>dead-end</b> <b>filtration</b> application. Intermittent back-flush conditions are created when a reverse-pressure pulse, during which product is drawn in the reverse direction through the membrane wall, is introduced.

Reverse-pressure spikes of up to - 90 kPa, which subside after only a few second to - 40 kPa, were generated. The combined effect of reverse-pressure pulsation sequence of events is that of (i) a short back-flush (direct result of negative trans-membrane pressure conditions that are introduced) and (ii) flow destabilisation (sudden retardation and start-up of lumen-flow) during a forward flush that precedes the reverse-pressure pulse event.

On exposure to UV light, TiO 2 nanoparticles emit electrons and create a surface roughness with a charge on the membranes which resulted in enhanced chromium rejection as well as flux. The surface modification has been analyzed by AFM and SEM (surface and cross sectional) images. The structural modification was investigated by ATR-IR and UV–Visible spectroscopy. The expected enhancement in hydrophilicity was studied by water uptake and contact angle measurements. The analysis of water flux and chromium rejection performed in a dead end filtration unit revealed a high water flux and 100 % chromium rejection with 2 wt. % of TiO 2 composite membrane in acidic pH. The pH of feed {{plays an important role}} in chromium rejection. The rejection of chromium decreases with an increase in feed concentration due to the variation in ion distribution. The effect of interference of other metals in chromium rejection is investigated. The overall work not only demonstrates the positive effects of surface modification, but also effective removal of hazardous chromium...|$|R
40|$|In <b>dead-end</b> {{hollow fiber}} <b>filtration</b> with humic acid solutions, we {{observed}} that the humic material accumulates in the final part of the fiber. We proved the hypothesis that backwashing of {{the last part of}} the fiber is sufficient to operate the filtration process in a sustainable manner. This strategy works very well for feed solutions that result in either local accumulation of the material at the end of the fiber, or that form a well-defined concentration polarization layer that does not lead to deposition. When deposition throughout the whole module occurs, the proposed cleaning strategy is unsuccessful. This overall deposition occurs when a force balance over the particle, results in net transport to the membrane surface over the entire length of the module. We simulated such conditions by the addition of calcium to the feed solutions. The latter results in large aggregates carried towards the whole membrane area by convective water flow, and an increased interaction between the aggregates and the membran...|$|R
40|$|Extraction {{kinetics}} of polyphenols and flavonoids from {{plant material}} and their separation and concentration by nanofiltration were investigated. The kinetics experiments {{were carried out}} with Cotinus coggygria. The influence of the extraction solvent on the extraction rate was defined. Four different extraction solvents or mixtures were applied – methanol, azeotropic ethanol, 50 / 50 ethanol/water mixture, and pure water. The optimum extraction rate of flavonoids and polyphenols was achieved by using 50 % ethanol as a solvent for extraction. This solvent mixture was used for generating extracts for the nanofiltration experiments. Organic solvent nanofiltration membranes from DuraMemTM series with different pore sizes (200, 300 500 and 900 Da) were tested in <b>dead-end</b> and cross-flow <b>filtration</b> systems. Flux and rejection data were obtained for every membrane type. Very good separation and respectively concentration of the extracted useful compounds was achieved (rejection for polyphenols and flavonoids is 91 and 93 %, respectively). During a feed/extract concentration experiment, the constant polyphenols and flavonoids rejection was measured. The {{results suggest that the}} nanofiltration technology could be combined successfully with solid-liquid extraction for natural sourced valuable compounds enrichment...|$|R
