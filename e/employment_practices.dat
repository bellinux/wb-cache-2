5|$|The {{private sector}} {{was not the}} only source of racism: under President Wilson, the plight of African Americans in {{government}} jobs suffered. Many federal agencies adopted whites-only <b>employment</b> <b>practices,</b> the Army excluded blacks from officer ranks, and the immigration service prohibited the immigration of persons of African ancestry. Du Bois wrote an editorial in 1914 deploring the dismissal of blacks from federal posts, and he supported William Monroe Trotter when Trotter brusquely confronted Wilson about Wilson's failure to fulfill his campaign promise of justice for blacks.|$|E
5|$|When the country's {{fortunes}} turned {{during the}} Great Depression, the violent Teamsters Strike of 1934 resulted in laws acknowledging workers' rights. A lifelong {{civil rights activist}} and union supporter, mayor Hubert Humphrey helped the city establish fair <b>employment</b> <b>practices</b> and a human relations council that interceded on behalf of minorities by 1946. In the 1950s, about 1.6% {{of the population of}} Minneapolis was nonwhite. Minneapolis contended with white supremacy, participated in desegregation and the civil rights movement, and in 1968 was the birthplace of the American Indian Movement.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to similar measures passed in Milwaukee and Chicago, the Minneapolis Fair Employment ordinance gave the city's newly created Fair <b>Employment</b> <b>Practices</b> Commission (FEPC) authority {{to not only}} impose fines, but also prison sentences for employers who enacted job discrimination. Larger banks and department stores saw the value in civil rights and began to hire more African-Americans. Humphrey also recognized that city police officers operating under racial and ethnic prejudice were causing urban unrest, so he instructed the city's police chief to have officers in minority neighborhoods keep in contact with clergy, teachers, business owners, and other neighborhood leaders. This helped to redefine the issue of prejudice and got its attention as a problem that could be solved, not just {{a fact of life}} that had to be taken for granted.|$|E

5|$|Since {{even before}} the {{official}} entry of the United States into World War II in December 1941, Philadelphia had been one on the major industrial war production centers in the U.S. By 1944 Philadelphia was regarded as the second largest war production center in the country. During that period the black population of the city grew substantially, and tensions with the predominantly white population began to increase. The Philadelphia Transportation Company (PTC) ran the city's huge public transportation system, including subways, buses and trolleys; {{by the time of}} the strike, it carried over one million people per day. By 1944, the PTC's eleven thousand strong workforce included 537 black employees. However, the PTC's black workers had been restricted to holding menial jobs; none were allowed to serve as conductors or motormen – positions that were reserved for white employees. As early as August 1941, black employees started pressuring the PTC for fairer <b>employment</b> <b>practices</b> that would allow upgrading of black workers to the more prestigious jobs hitherto reserved for whites. Their efforts were rebuffed by PTC management, who claimed that the current union contract contained a clause prohibiting any significant change in <b>employment</b> <b>practices</b> and customs without the union's approval (although the contract said nothing about race). The leader of the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Employees Union (PRTEU), Frank Carney, proved to be equally reticent and claimed that he was not authorized by the union members to consider a request to allow promotions of black employees.|$|E
5|$|Humphrey first ran {{for mayor}} of Minneapolis in 1943, losing by only six {{thousand}} votes. He campaigned again in the 1945 election, {{with the support of}} the city's labor leaders, and found support with the city's African-American community by promising to implement a city civil rights commission. He also appealed to the city's middle class by giving talks on civic virtue at area churches. He was elected in 1945 by the largest margin to date. When elected, he immediately proposed a city ordinance that would make racial discrimination by employers subject to a fine. After a long period of discussion, the Minneapolis City Council finally approved the ordinance by a 21 to 3 margin on January 31, 1947. The ordinance created the nation's first Fair <b>Employment</b> <b>Practices</b> Ordinance and established Minneapolis as the nation's leader in imposing fines for employment discrimination, though pressure from the local Urban League would also limit employment opportunities for African Americans during the ordinance's first few years.|$|E
5|$|In view {{of growing}} labor shortages, on July 1, 1944 the War Manpower Commission made an {{important}} decision, ruling that {{from then on}} all hiring of male employees in the country was to be done through the United States Employment Service (USES). By that time the USES followed strict anti-discrimination <b>employment</b> <b>practices.</b> The PTC management finally gave in and within a week posted notices about available skilled positions that {{would be open to}} all applicants, regardless of race. The company accepted eight black applicants (three from the USES and five from its own ranks) to train as streetcar coachmen. Their training was to take place in late July, and they were to start taking an empty streetcar on the lines from August 1. It was that impending trial run of the streetcars by the eight black trainees that finally triggered the strike.|$|E

[...] A. Philip Randolph, founding president of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, had lobbied with other activists for such provisions due to the wide discrimination against African Americans in employment across the country. With the buildup of defense industries before the United States entered the war, blacks were being excluded from economic opportunities. With all groups of Americans being asked to support the war effort, Randolph demanded changes in <b>employment</b> <b>practice</b> of the defense industries, which regularly excluded African Americans and other minorities based on race.|$|R
