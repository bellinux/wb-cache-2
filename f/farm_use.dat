25|$|The Cottonwood is a {{reliable}} surface limestone aquifer in the region. The brush line seen on many hillsides {{at the base}} of this member indicates the moisture it provides. Many springs issue from beneath the massive ledge, especially the west-facing exposures—many of which serve as a source of water for livestock. In many places, springs or shallow wells from the Cottonwood provide large supplies of water for domestic home and <b>farm</b> <b>use.</b> This is especially true along westward-facing hillsides, as strata generally dip to the northwest.|$|E
25|$|For <b>farm</b> <b>use,</b> pellets of {{aluminium}} phosphide, calcium phosphide, or zinc phosphide release phosphine upon contact with atmospheric water or rodents' stomach acid. These pellets also contain agents {{to reduce the}} potential for ignition or explosion of the released phosphine. A more recent alternative {{is the use of}} phosphine gas itself which requires dilution with either CO2 or N2 or even air to bring it below the flammability point. Use of the gas avoids the issues related with the solid residues left by metal phosphide and results in faster, more efficient control of the target pests.|$|E

2500|$|By 1970, {{the state}} had five bonded wineries, with [...] in production. Many out-of-state winemakers, the bulk of them from California, began {{migrating}} to the state, including Dick Erath, Dick and Nancy Ponzi, Susan and Bill Sokol Blosser of Sokol Blosser Winery, David and Ginny Adelsheim, Pat and Joe Campbell, Jerry and Ann Preston, and Myron Redford. In 1973, Oregon passed its landmark land-use law, which imposed strict separation between agricultural and urban uses of land via such mechanism as the Urban Growth Boundary and Exclusive <b>Farm</b> <b>Use</b> Zones. This prevented many hillsides, deemed inappropriate for other crops which are easier to grow on flat fields, from being converted to housing. Also in the 1970s, the winemakers of the region began to organize to promote their vintages. In 1977, the first coffee table book about Northwest wines, entitled Winemakers of the Pacific Northwest, was printed; the following year, a joint marketing brochure entitled [...] "Discover Oregon Wines" [...] was published.|$|E
2500|$|On 13 June 1981, Sheela's husband, John Shelfer, {{signed a}} {{purchase}} contract to buy property in Oregon for US$5.75 million, {{and a few}} days later assigned the property to the US foundation. The property was a [...] ranch, previously known as [...] "The Big Muddy Ranch" [...] and located across two Oregon counties (Wasco and Jefferson). It was renamed [...] "Rancho Rajneesh" [...] and Rajneesh moved there on 29 August. One Oregon professor: [...] "The initial response in Oregon was an uneasy balance in which tolerance tended to outweigh hostility with increasing distance." [...] The press reported, and another study found, that the development met almost immediately with intense local, state and federal opposition from the government, press and citizenry. Initial local community reactions ranged from hostility to tolerance, depending on distance from the ranch. Within months a series of legal battles ensued, principally over land use. In May 1982 the residents of Rancho Rajneesh voted to incorporate it as the city of Rajneeshpuram. 1000 Friends of Oregon immediately commenced and then prosecuted {{over the next six years}} numerous court and administrative actions to void the incorporation and cause buildings and improvement to be removed. 1000 Friends publicly called for the City to be [...] "dismantled". A 1000 Friends Attorney stated that if 1000 Friends won, the Foundation would be “forced to remove their sewer system and tear down many of the buildings. In 1985, the Oregon Supreme Court found that the land was not suitable for farming, and therefore did not need to satisfy the complicated land use procedures and standards, but remanded for determination on other issues. In 1987, the Supreme Court finally resolved the case in favour of the City, by which time of course, the community had disbanded. During the course of the litigation, 1000 Friends ran a fundraising ad throughout Oregon headlined [...] "Rajneeshpuram Alert. [...] Worrying about Rajneeshpuram Won't Help." [...] An Oregonian editorial commented on the ad, stating that 1000 Friends [...] "ought to be ashamed of itself" [...] for a campaign [...] "based on fear and prejudice". Ironically, the Federal Bureau of Land Management found that the highest <b>farm</b> <b>use</b> of the land in question was the grazing of 9 cattle.|$|E

40|$|The {{accumulation}} of copper and zinc, the basic components of anti-fouling paints, was examined in cultured sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax and sea bream Sparus aurata. Samplings {{were carried out}} at 4 eastern Mediterranean fish farms. Two of the <b>farms</b> <b>used</b> nets treated with anti-fouling paints, and 2 used untreated nets. At each farm samples of sediment and fish tissue (muscle, liver and gills) were analysed for heavy metal concentrations. The results showed that while total copper and zinc concentrations in sediments were quite similar in samples collected from the 4 farms, the extractable copper concentration in sediment from <b>farms</b> <b>using</b> anti-fouling treatment was 2 to 3 times higher than from those using untreated nets. Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences for either metal between sediment samples from <b>farms</b> <b>using</b> anti-fouling treatment and those which did not, except for extractable copper concentrations. However, analysis of the biological samples showed that copper concentrations in muscle tissue were lower in samples from <b>farms</b> <b>using</b> untreated nets, with the highest copper concentrations being observed in fish livers from <b>farms</b> <b>using</b> anti-fouling paints. General linear model results indicated significant differences between heavy metal concentrations in fish samples from <b>farms</b> <b>using</b> antifouling paints and those which did not. Furthermore, 1 -way ANOVA indicated that these differences were confined to liver tissue for zinc, whereas significant differences for copper were seen in all tissues (except for gills of sea bream) for both species studied. These {{results indicate that the}} use of anti-fouling paints may be a potential source of metal accumulation in cultured fish...|$|R
