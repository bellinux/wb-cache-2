[...] He used paired imitation, like Josquin, but often in a freer manner than the more famous composer. [...] A relatively unusual technique he used in an untitled mass was to use different source material for each of the sections (mass titles are taken from the pre-existing composition used as their basis: [...] usually a plainchant, motet or chanson: [...] hence the mass is without title). [...] Brumel wrote a Missa l'homme armé, as <b>did</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> other composers of the Renaissance: [...] appropriately, he set it as a cantus firmus mass, with the popular song in long notes in the tenor, to make it easier to hear.
