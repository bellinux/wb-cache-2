5|$|There is an {{impending}} real estate boom in Saudi Arabia, with increasing demand and rising prices {{due to high}} population growth and a short supply of housing, which may include a demand for high-end luxury units, {{such as those in}} Jeddah Tower. To boost growth, the Saudi Arabian <b>government</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> invest US$67 billion (SR251 billion) in building 500,000homes throughout the country. According to Saudi officials, about 900 new homes are needed a day to meet the demand of the rapidly growing population, which has nearly quadrupled in the past four decades. Jeddah Tower is also an attempt to diversify Saudi Arabia's economy, which, holding a quarter of the world's oil reserves and being one of the founding OPEC nations, is currently largely dependent on its crude oil exportation, which accounts for nearly 75% of government revenues and 90% of exports. This generates enough income to support Saudi Arabia as a welfare state, which spends billions of dollars on job creation and housing for its lower income residents.|$|E

500|$|Legislation for {{a silver}} fifty-cent piece {{and a gold}} one-dollar piece in {{commemoration}} of the 150th anniversaries of the Battle of Bennington and of the independence of Vermont {{was introduced in the}} Senate by that state's Frank Greene on January 9, 1925. Greene had not always been a friend to commemorative coins: when the Monroe Doctrine Centennial half dollar was debated in 1922, he commented, [...] "the question is whether the United States <b>Government</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> go on from year to year submitting its coinage to this—well—harlotry." [...] His bill was referred to the Committee on Banking and Currency. Greene, a member of that committee, reported the bill back to the Senate on January 20, with an amendment and a recommendation that it pass. The amendment deleted the proposed one-dollar piece and increased the mintage of the half dollar from 20,000 to 40,000. On January 24, New Hampshire's George H. Moses, acting on Greene's behalf, moved that the Senate consider the bill, and it passed that body without opposition.|$|E
500|$|Realizing that Congress {{might not}} pass {{legislation}} for a coin to commemorate a film industry celebration, the organizers sought a historical event {{with a major}} anniversary to occur in 1923, which could be honored both at the fair and on the coin. [...] The obvious candidate was the Boston Tea Party of 1773, but according to numismatists Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen in their volume on U.S. commemorative coins, that episode [...] "could not be tortured into even the vaguest relevance to California, let alone to Los Angeles". On December18, 1922, California Congressman Walter Franklin Lineberger introduced a bill to strike a half dollar in commemoration of the centennial of the Monroe Doctrine, with the Los Angeles Clearing House (an association of banks) given the exclusive right to purchase the pieces from the government at face value. [...] Lineberger claimed that Monroe's declaration had kept California, then owned by Mexico, {{out of the hands}} of European powers. [...] The bill was questioned in the House of Representatives by Michigan Congressman Louis Cramton, and in the Senate by Vermont's Frank Greene, who stated, [...] "it seems to me that the question is not one of selling a coin at a particular value or a particular place. The question is whether the United States <b>government</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> go on from year to year submitting its coinage to this—well—harlotry." [...] Despite these objections, the bill was enacted on January24, 1923; a mintage of 300,000pieces was authorized.|$|E

Minutes later he refused to speak with investigators and asked for an attorney. Bales' civilian attorney John Henry Browne, later said, [...] "I don't know that the <b>government</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> prove much. There's no forensic evidence.

2500|$|Due to Austria's {{delay in}} writing the ultimatum, the element of {{surprise}} that Germany had counted upon in the war against Serbia was lost. Instead, the strategy of [...] "localization" [...] was adopted, which meant that when the Austro-Serbian war began, Germany would pressure other powers not to become involved even at the risk of war. On 19 July, Jagow published a note in the semi-official North German Gazette warning other powers [...] "that the settlement of differences which may arise between Austria-Hungary and Serbia should remain localized". Asked by Jules Cambon, the French Ambassador to Germany, how he knew about the contents of the Austrian ultimatum as he had revealed in the North German Gazette, Gottlieb von Jagow pretended to be ignorant of it. Sir Horace Rumbold of the British Embassy in Berlin reported: [...] "We do not know the facts. The German government clearly do know. They know what the Austrian <b>government</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> demand... and I think we may say with some assurance that they had expressed approval of those demands and promised support should dangerous complications ensure... the German government did not believe that there is any danger of war." ...|$|E

Barr said in 2010 [...] "I can see a situation where the federal <b>government</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> bring an entire suitcase of San Francisco values to the American family, and while I would love to explain all the things that are wrong with that, the fact {{is that this is a}} corrupting, left-leaning, influence on a section of society that so many liberal elites want to see taken out of the 'red state' column. The only solution to this kind of behavior is dour and austere social conservatism, like my own".
