Following their victory, Toyota changed a decision to run a sole car at Shanghai and include a second with reports suggesting the company wished to increase their prospects of winning a race on outright speed. It was also confirmed that Nakajima would skip the round to contest the Super Formula Championship. Lapierre and Wurz qualified the No. 7 car on pole position with the No. 8 entry of Sarrazin and Buemi separating the two Audi cars in third. The No. 7 Toyota was leading the race going into the final hour, but lost the position when Wurz went off the racing line while moving past slower traffic because of worn tyres. It was overtaken by the No. 1 Audi and Wurz could only manage second place in the No. 7 entry. Toyota's No. 8 car retired from the lead in the fifth hour because a right-front suspension bolt sheared.|$|E
