25|$|In 1999, SAS sold {{half of its}} 40% {{stake in}} British Midland to Lufthansa, which was seeking a {{stronger}} position at London Heathrow, following which British Midland joined Star Alliance. At the time, British Midland chairman Sir Michael Bishop owned a 50% share of the company. Between 1999 and 2004, Lufthansa sought to sell {{some or all of}} its share in the airline. Virgin Atlantic hoped to buy the shares to then merge both airlines, as BMI was already Virgin's preferred <b>feeder</b> <b>airline</b> into Heathrow. Virgin argued that the merger would have brought together two airlines with combined ticket sales of more than £2billion, forming a powerful force in the aviation industry. BMI was believed to have initiated the talks after it began losing money following the 11 September 2001 attacks. A merger would have strengthened Virgin Atlantic's base at Heathrow, where BMI had hundreds of highly valued take-off and landing slots, to increase the competition with British Airways.|$|E
