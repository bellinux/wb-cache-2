25|$|OBD-II is an {{improvement}} over OBD-I in both capability and standardization. The OBD-II standard specifies the type of diagnostic connector and its pinout, the electrical signalling protocols available, and the messaging format. It also provides a candidate list of vehicle parameters to monitor along with how to encode the data for each. There is a pin in the connector that provides power for the scan tool from the vehicle battery, which eliminates the need to connect a scan tool to a power source separately. However, some technicians might still connect the scan tool to an auxiliary power source to protect data in the unusual event that a vehicle experiences a {{loss of electrical power}} due to a malfunction. Finally, the OBD-II standard provides list of standardized DTCs. As a result of this standardization, a single device can query the on-board computer(s) for these parameters in any vehicle. OBD-II standardization was prompted to simplify diagnosis of increasingly complicated emissions equipment, and though only emission-related codes and data are required to be transmitted through it according to U.S. legislation, most manufacturers have made the OBD-II Data Link Connector the main connector in the vehicle through which all systems are diagnosed and reprogrammed. OBD-II <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>Trouble</b> <b>Codes</b> are 4-digit, preceded by a letter: P for engine and transmission (powertrain), B for body, C for chassis, and U for network. Manufacturers may also add custom data parameters to their specific OBD-II implementation, including real-time data requests as well as trouble codes.|$|E

40|$|The {{diagnostics}} {{and monitoring}} of the running condition of a car engine is very important and smart way to enhance the efficiency and maintenance of the engine. In the modern era almost all modern vehicles include an On Board Diagnostic (OBD) system. The OBD system can always monitor the running condition of engine. When the OBD system detects a malfunction in any of sensors or engine parameters, OBD regulations require the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) of the vehicle to save a standardized <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>Trouble</b> <b>Code</b> (DTC) about the information of malfunction in the memory. These DTCâ€™s can be processed and read by connecting external scanner to OBD system which then shows the diagnostic results. But this project removes the need of external scanner. The {{purpose of this study}} is to make the information of different sensors of engine and parameters of vehicle freely available to drivers or mechanics on an embedded screen device. This system eliminates the need of any external scanner required to show the diagnostic results of OBD system and solves these problems by providing many useful functions such as real time display of sensor data, <b>diagnostic</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>code</b> (DTC) reading and displaying information of different sensors and parameters of engine in a simple and an easily understandable language for the user (driver) ...|$|R

2500|$|On-board {{diagnostics}} (OBD) is an automotive term {{referring to}} a vehicle's self-diagnostic and reporting capability. OBD systems give the vehicle owner or repair technician access {{to the status of}} the various vehicle subsystems. The amount of diagnostic information available via OBD has varied widely since its introduction in the early 1980s versions of on-board vehicle computers. Early versions of OBD would simply illuminate a malfunction indicator light or [...] "idiot light" [...] if a problem was detected but would not provide any information as {{to the nature of the}} problem. Modern OBD implementations use a standardized digital communications port to provide real-time data in addition to a standardized series of <b>diagnostic</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>codes,</b> or DTCs, which allow one to rapidly identify and remedy malfunctions within the vehicle.|$|E
40|$|An {{on-board}} diagnostic II (OBD-II) is {{a standard}} diagnostic software management that is installed in a power train control module (PCM). It provides some useful data to the driver. There are four different devices using the OBD-II protocol exists in the market. These devices are used as a driver information system. They are personal digital assistant (PDA) Dyno/OBD-II scan tool, CarChip Fleet, DriveRight 600, and ScanGauge. Each of these four devices has some limitation in term of supporting all features for live data monitoring, trip information, <b>diagnostic</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>code</b> (DTC) scanning system, and data logging system. Thus, {{there is a need}} for a device that supports all these features together with scheduled maintenance reminder. This paper describes the design and development of driver information based on OBD-II protocol using embedded system architecture. Its hardware and software systems were designed based on four design considerations: upgrade capability, high data storage capacity, back-up capability, and user friendly. The proposed system was successfully interfaced and tested with the PCM of Hyundai Getz car...|$|R
40|$|Most modern road {{vehicles}} today utilise the CAN bus for internal communication between sensors, instruments and control units. It is a bus that is cheap, reliable, durable against electrical disturbances and {{well suited for}} the vehicle industry. While {{the acceptance of the}} CAN bus has grown over the years, so has the need to standardise services possible to perform using this network. A document called ISO 14229 - 1 has been put together that will cover these issues, and can hopefully be accepted as a world standard of services in a near future. ISO 14229 - 1 covers everything from testing the exhaust levels of the fumes, to reading sensor values or downloading new software. The set of services that can be performed is referred to as Diagnostics. If an error occurs, for instance a sensor reports erroneous values, this is logged as a <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>Trouble</b> <b>Code</b> in the control unit. It is now possible when fixing the vehicle to extract and interpret the <b>trouble</b> <b>code,</b> which yields the problem, and by this replace the faulty sensor. When accessing the CAN bus a cable has to be connected to the vehicle. The cable limits freedom of movement, which can cause a lot of annoyance. An example would be when a mechanic performs tests with his scan tool. Say that he wants to check that all the lights on a truck are operable. He or she needs a really long cable to reach around the trailer. A wireless link would be a far better alternative. The Bluetooth technology could be used as link between the tool and the vehicles CAN bus. This thesis investigates and implements a solution on how to perform diagnostic services using Bluetooth as a gateway between the diagnostic terminal and the CAN bus of a road vehicle. The implementation covers a set of services according to ISO 14229 - 1, including the download function. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
40|$|This study {{implemented}} a mobile diagnosing system that provides user-centered interfaces for more precisely estimating and diagnosing engine conditions through communications with the self-developed ECU only for industrial CRDI engine use. For the implemented system, a new protocol {{was designed and}} applied based on OBD-II standard to receive engine data values of the developed ECU. The designed protocol consists of a message structure to request data transmission from a smartphone to ECU and a response message structure for ECU to send data to a smartphone. It transmits 31 pieces of engine condition information simultaneously and sends the <b>trouble</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>code.</b> Because the diagnostic system enables real-time communication through modules, the engine condition information can be checked at any time. Thus, because when troubles {{take place on the}} engine, users can check them right away, quick response and resolution are possible, and stable system management can be expected...|$|R
2500|$|... 1980: General Motors {{implements}} {{a proprietary}} interface and protocol for {{testing of the}} Engine Control Module (ECM) on the vehicle assembly line. The 'assembly line diagnostic link' (ALDL) protocol broadcasts at 160 bit/s Implemented on California vehicles for the 1980 model year, {{and the rest of}} the United States in 1981. Most owners can read DTCs (<b>Diagnostic</b> <b>Trouble</b> <b>Code(s))</b> by commanding the ECM (Engine Control Module) to flash the CEL (Check Engine Lamp) or MIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) on and off. [...] A PC based Software package called WinALDL will listen to the CLCC (Closed Loop Carburetor Control) and early CLC EFI datastreams over a fairly easy to construct interface cable that converts the 160 baud TTL serial data being transmitted by the ECM to RS232 or USB serial data [...] but there is not much information transmitted by these early ECMs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{regulatory}} {{intent of}} OBD-I was to encourage auto manufacturers to design reliable {{emission control systems}} that remain effective for the vehicle's [...] "useful life". The <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>Trouble</b> <b>Codes</b> (DTCs) of OBD-I vehicles can usually be found without an expensive 'scan tool'. Each manufacturer used their own diagnostic link connector (DLC), DLC location, DTC definitions, and procedure to read the DTCs from the vehicle. DTCs from OBD-I cars are often read through the blinking patterns of the 'Check Engine Light' (CEL) or 'Service Engine Soon' (SES) light. By connecting certain pins of the diagnostic connector, the 'Check Engine' light will blink out a two-digit number that corresponds to a specific error condition. The DTCs of some OBD-I cars are interpreted in different ways, however. Cadillac (gasoline) fuel-injected vehicles are equipped with actual on-board diagnostics, providing trouble codes, actuator tests and sensor data through the new digital Electronic Climate Control display. Holding down 'Off' and 'Warmer' for several seconds activates the diagnostic mode {{without the need for}} an external scan tool. Some Honda engine computers are equipped with LEDs that light up in a specific pattern to indicate the DTC. General Motors, some 1989â€“1995 Ford vehicles (DCL), and some 1989â€“1995 Toyota/Lexus vehicles have a live sensor data stream available, however, many other OBD-I equipped vehicles do not. OBD-I vehicles have fewer DTCs available than for OBD-II equipped vehicles.|$|E

40|$|The modern {{automobile}} is {{a complex}} electromechanical system controlled by control systems which consist of several interdependent electronic control units (ECUs). Analysis of the data generated by these modules {{is very important in}} order to observe the interesting patterns among data. At Volvo Cars Corporation today, diagnostic read-out data is retrieved from client machines installed at workshops in different countries around the world. The problem with this data {{is that it does not}} show a clear picture as what is causing what i. e. tracking the problem. Diagnostic engineers at Volvo Cars Corporation perform routine based statistical analysis of diagnostic read-out data manually, which is time consuming and tedious work. Moreover, this analysis is restricted to basic level mainly statistical analysis of diagnostic readout data. We present an approach based on statistical analysis and cluster analysis. Our approach focused on analysing the data from a pure statistical stand-point to isolate the problem in diagnostic read-out data, thereby helping to visualize and analyse the nature of the problem at hand. Different general statistical formulae were applied to get meaningful information from large amount of DRO data. Cluster analysis was carried out to get clusters consisting of similar <b>trouble</b> <b>codes.</b> Different methods and techniques were considered for the purpose of cluster analysis. Hierarchical and non-hierarchical clusters were extracted by applying appropriate algorithms. The results obtained from the thesis work show that the diagnostic read-out data consist of independent and interdependent fault codes. Groups were generated which consist of similar <b>trouble</b> <b>codes.</b> Furthermore, corresponding factors from freeze frame data which shows significant variation for these groups were also extracted. These faults, groups of faults and factors were later interpreted and validated by diagnostic engineers...|$|R
