50|$|Less than {{truckload}} shipping or {{less than}} load (LTL) is the transportation of relatively small freight. The alternatives to LTL carriers are parcel carriers or <b>full</b> <b>truckload</b> carriers. Parcel carriers usually handle small packages and freight that {{can be broken down}} into units less than 150 lb. <b>Full</b> <b>truckload</b> carriers move freight that is loaded into a semi-trailer. Semi trailers are typically between 26 and 53 ft and require a substantial amount of freight to make such transportation economical.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Responsibilities== <b>Full</b> <b>truckload</b> {{carriers}} normally {{deliver a}} semi trailer to a shipper who will fill the trailer with freight for one destination. After the trailer is loaded, the driver {{returns to the}} shipper to collect the required paperwork (i.e. Bill of lading, Invoice, and Customs paperwork) and depart with the trailer containing freight. In most cases the driver then proceeds directly to the consignee and delivers the freight him or herself. Occasionally, a driver will transfer the trailer to another driver who will drive the freight {{the rest of the}} way. <b>Full</b> <b>Truckload</b> (FTL) transit times are normally constrained by the driver's availability according to Hours of Service regulations and distance. It is normally accepted that <b>Full</b> <b>Truckload</b> drivers will transport freight at an average rate of 47 miles per hour (including traffic jams or queues at intersections).|$|E

After classifying the existing cross-docking research, we conclude that the overwhelming majority of papers fail to consider the synchronization of local and network-wide cross-docking operations. Lastly, to highlight the importance of synchronization in cross-docking networks, two real-life illustrative problems are described that are not yet addressed in the literature...|$|R

Backhauling is studied for two terminals sending <b>full</b> <b>truckloads</b> to many customers under steady-state conditions. This research develops two backhauling models. The first is a continuous model that makes simplifying assumptions about customer locations and travel distances. It results in formulae showing that 1) savings from backhauling increase at a decreasing rate as the directional flow of freight between two terminals becomes more balanced and 2) backhauling is an important, but often ignored, factor in terminal (e. g. trucking terminal, warehouse, or plant) location and supplier selection decisions. The second model is a more general discrete model that determines which loads should be backhauled to minimize empty truck-miles. ...|$|R

One replenishment policy, taking into account capacity restrictions of the total order volume, is the so-called QS policy, where replenishment orders are placed to raise the individual inventory positions of all items to their order-up-to levels, whenever the aggregate inventory position drops below the reorder level. We first provide a method to compute the policy parameters of an QS policy such that item target service levels can be met, under the assumption that demand can be modeled as a compound renewal process. The approximate formulas are based on renewal theoretic results and are tested in a simulation study, revealing a good performance. Second, we compare the QS policy with a simple allocation policy, where replenishment orders are triggered by the individual inventory positions of the items. At the moment when an individual inventory position drops below its item reorder level a replenishment order is triggered and the total vehicle capacity is allocated among all items such that the expected elapsed time before the next replenishment order is maximized. In an extensive simulation study it is illustrated that the QS policy outperforms this allocation policy, standing for lower inventory levels to obtain the same service level.

For the distribution of spare parts to car dealers in Europe, Toyota operates two hubs, one in Germany and one in the Czech Republic. Car dealers requiring spare parts may place an order by telephone or the internet during the day and Toyota promises next-day delivery from one of its hubs for all parts ordered before a certain cut-off time.

40|$|Dit proefschrift ontwerpt een retail supply chain, die beter en goedkoper is dan de gangbare. Dit wordt bereikt door de distributie te synchroniseren op de productie¬momenten. Goederen zouden direct uit productie al stroomafwaarts moeten bewegen, van fabrikant naar {{retailer}}, tegen lage kosten, in volle pallets en in volle auto’s en in hoeveel¬heden die groot genoeg zijn om de vraag tot het volgende productiemoment te dekken. Door de formules van de "Krantenverkoper" en die van de economische ordergrootte (EOQ) aan te passen aan een multi-echelon divergerend distributienetwerk, kan ook theoretisch worden bewezen dat het stroomafwaarts positioneren van voorraden inderdaad optimaal is en dat de voorraden daardoor zullen dalen. De huidige magazijnen van de leveranciers kunnen worden gereduceerd tot overslagpunten, waar goederen van de verschillende fabrieken van een leverancier worden samengebracht om rijden met vollere vrachtwagens mogelijk maken. Kleinere hoeveelheden kunnen leveranciers beter afleveren bij het dichtstbijzijnde distributiecentrum van een retailer, waarna de retailer zelf het deel met bestemming elders verder vervoert. Tenslotte kan de winkelbevoorrading worden aangepast aan de schapruimte, waardoor de werkwijze in de distributiecentra kan worden gerationaliseerd. Piet van der Vlist (1947) {{was born}} in Ouderkerk aan den IJssel. He received his high-school diploma from the Marnix Gymnasium in Rotterdam. Also in Rotterdam he graduated as Electronics Engineer at the University of Applied Sciences. He obtained a Master of Science in Electronics at the Delft University of Technology and one in Management Sciences at the University of Twente. He worked 15 years with the Dutch Ministry of Defense on the design and realization {{of the first generation}} digital communications systems. Then he joined Bakkenist Management Consultants and later Deloitte Consultancy, together for over 20 years. As consultant he was involved in numerous projects on Data exchange and Supply Chain redesign. Besides that, he was for 11 years (part-time) professor in ICT and Logistics at the Eindhoven University of Technology. Piet wrote and edited several books on data exchange and published numerous articles in business and scientific journals. A fairly good overview of his scientific career {{can be found in the}} "Liber Amicorum" that his friends wrote when he left Eindhoven University 1. His current research interests lie in the design and management of retail supply chains, all the way from production down to the shelves. He found that the supply chain with the overall lowest costs requires synchronization of distribution to production and not the other way around as current practice seems to dictate. When he had to quit his jobs for health reasons, he finally found the opportunity to devote his time to research and extend the theory that supports Supply Chain Synchronization. He programmed built to purpose simulation models to get a better insight in the dynamics of synchronized supply chains. He joined both the Rotterdam Erasmus University to work with Professor Jo van Nunen and the Eindhoven University of Technology to work with Professor Ton de Kok. This PhD thesis is the result of that effort. This thesis is a design of a retail supply chain that is better and cheaper than the usual one. This is achieved by synchronizing distribution to production. Right from production goods should move downstream the supply chain at low cost in full pallets and in <b>full</b> <b>truckloads,</b> in quantities large enough to cover the needs till the next production run. By extending both the Newsvendor- and the EOQ-formulae to a multi-echelon divergent network, it can be proved that such forward positioning of inventory indeed is optimal and that overall supply chain inventories will drop. The suppliers’ warehouses become stockless cross docking points, where goods from the supplier’s various sourcing plants are brought together to consolidate them into <b>full</b> <b>truckloads.</b> Whenever suppliers deliver lower volumes, they better bring these goods to the nearest retailer’s facility; thereafter the retailer himself should move these goods onward to the proper destination within the retailer’s network.
