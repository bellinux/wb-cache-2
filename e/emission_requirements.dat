25|$|Aston Martin {{was often}} financially troubled. In 1972 David Brown paid off all its debts, {{said to be}} £5 million or more, and handed it for £101 to Company Developments, a Birmingham-based {{investment}} bank consortium chaired by accountant William Willson. More detail on this period may be read at Willson's biography. The worldwide recession, lack of working capital and the difficulties of developing without proper resources an engine to meet California's exhaust <b>emission</b> <b>requirements</b> — it stopped Aston's US sales — again pulled Aston Martin into receivership {{at the end of}} 1974. There were 460 workers when the plant closed.|$|E
25|$|Technical {{changes for}} 1975 {{included}} {{the addition of}} a catalytic converter and electronic ignition to not only meet the stringent 1975 and later <b>emission</b> <b>requirements,</b> but also extended routine maintenance intervals, and improved fuel economy and driveability which was a must in the era immediately following the 1973–74 energy crisis, but also spelled the end of dual exhaust systems and mandated the use of unleaded gasoline as the converter could be rendered useless if contaminated with lead. Axle ratios were also numerically lowered to aid in improving gas mileage. The 455 four-barrel V8, now rated at , was retained as the standard and only available engine.|$|E

2500|$|By 1974, General Motors R had not {{succeeded in}} {{producing}} a Wankel engine meeting both the <b>emission</b> <b>requirements</b> and good fuel economy, leading {{a decision by}} the company to cancel the project. Because of that decision, the R team only partly released the results of its most recent research, which claimed to have solved the fuel economy problem, as well as building reliable engines with a lifespan above [...] Those findings were not taken into account when the cancellation order was issued. The ending of General Motors' Wankel project required AMC to reconfigure the Pacer to house its venerable AMC straight-6 engine driving the rear-wheels.|$|E
2500|$|Renault {{failed to}} fully {{accommodate}} the European-origin cars to U.S. market demands. These included the Alliance's less powerful engine whose output was further {{limited by the}} more demanding U.S. <b>emission</b> <b>requirements,</b> {{as well as the}} popularity of air conditioning in the U.S. when it was seldom ordered by European customers. The exchange rate of the U.S. dollar also became [...] "very problematic in the mid-1980s" [...] due to the inflation and declining economy in the U.S., compared to French currency. Renault also did not consider the costs of manufacturing at AMC, and failed to [...] "properly support its distribution network" [...] because AMC's U.S. dealerships were seldom brand exclusive. The mistakes in controlling [...] "the quality delivered by the distribution network" [...] resulted in [...] "disastrous" [...] consequences for the image of the automobiles, as well as increasing warranty costs.|$|E
