People forget that, but it was the main ideology for me: we don't care what you think—you're shit anyway. It was the attitude that got people moving, as well as the music.|$|E

It also illustrates vistas from the places he visited and documents national monuments including the Elizabeth Tower, the Eiffel Tower, the Sydney Opera House, Taj Mahal, Giza pyramid complex, the Colosseum and Christ the Redeemer statue in Brazil. Ludacris, joins Bieber in the video during the rap portion of the song. It also included images of the singer posing with fans, and others crying and screaming for him.|$|E

When {{asked if he would}} rather play the 19,600-seat Fleet Theater or the 900-seat Somerville Theater – both in Boston, Paul replied, [...] "I prefer to keep it intimate. That way people can see the whites of your eyes. I'd love to write a hit song and have it on the radio like [...] "American Pie" [...] or something, but I'm just gonna <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> and take what I can and run with it, because it's a hard business to have even what I have.

500|$|As Planet Terror took shape, Tarantino {{developed}} {{the story for}} Death Proof, based on his fascination for the way stuntmen would [...] "death-proof" [...] their cars. As {{long as they were}} driving, stuntmen could slam their cars headfirst into a brick wall at 60mph (97km/h) and survive. This inspired Tarantino to create a slasher film featuring a deranged stuntman who stalks and murders sexy young women with his [...] "death-proof" [...] car. Tarantino remembers, [...] "I realized I couldn't do a straight slasher film, because with the exception of women-in-prison films, there is no other genre quite as rigid. And if you break that up, you aren't really doing it anymore. It's inorganic, so I realized—let me take the structure of a slasher film and just <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> My version is going to be fucked up and disjointed, but it seemingly uses the structure of a slasher film, hopefully against you." ...|$|E
500|$|Lancashire's final role {{under her}} ITV {{contract}} was Gertrude Morel in {{an adaptation of}} D.H. Lawrence's 1913 novel Sons and Lovers, airing in January 2003. The portrayal–her first of a mother with adult children– followed Gertrude's transformation from a young bride into a fifty-something woman ravaged by her life experiences of poverty and domestic abuse. Lancashire re-read the novel several times prior to filming, and identified with the themes of filial and marital relationships she {{had been unable to}} appreciate as a GCSE student. The miniseries gave her a sense of conviction in her career path, stating ahead of the broadcast in 2002: [...] "whatever the reason I <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> I felt I had come to a point where I could stop searching after this". Reviewing the serial Paul Hoggart of The Times wrote that Lancashire [...] "steals the show" [...] with a [...] "performance of immense subtlety and quiet strength, proof, if we still needed it, that she has matured into a terrific actress." [...] Conversely Andrew Billen, writing in New Statesman, wrote that [...] "Sarah Lancashire was no revelation at all", purely because she had [...] "long since proved herself a formidable actress".|$|E

Fans could vote between three alternative endings through Idols official website. Lopez said the idea behind giving fans the choice was {{to give them a}} chance to see what she experienced. [...] "You get to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,...</b> Like, I go in there with my videos and I start editing and picking all the shots I like and the things that I like and what I feel the best kind of feeling for the record is. You guys get to do that. We picked two different ones and we weren't sure." [...] The alternative endings included three varying scenes: in the first, the video ends with a close-up of Lopez's face in the silver lace catsuit; the second ends with a shot of dancers defying gravity on the walls and ceiling, while the final ending ends with a shot of Lopez on the dance floor in her harem pants. The first ending was the one used in the final video.|$|E

500|$|Davis toured relentlessly for {{two years}} while tolerating intense {{physical}} pain and difficulty walking, caused by joint pain from sickle-cell anaemia, badly damaged ankles after a 1972 car wreck, and osteoporosis in his left hip, which had been operated on a decade earlier. He had also developed nodules on his larynx that often left him short of breath, especially when playing the trumpet. To numb the pain, he became increasingly dependent on self-medicating with painkillers, cocaine, and morphine, which combined with his alcohol and recreational drug use led to mood swings; he would by turns feel vulnerable and hostile. By the end of 1974, a disappointing showing in Down Beat magazine's readers poll reinforced to Davis that his reputation had diminished. Unfazed by detractors and personal troubles, he kept his touring schedule intense. [...] "He was like the general looking at the fort {{and they had a}} moat {{and we were going to}} get in that fort", Henderson later said. [...] "That was the attitude of the band. We didn't give a shit what the critics said. People are gonna like what they like, but if you don't like it, respect it. Respect that I have the right to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> Because with or without you, we're going to do it anyway." ...|$|E

I feel it's important for me to continue to let my generation know how important he was to music." [...] Ciara also cites Whitney Houston, Aaliyah, TLC, SWV, Monica and Salt-n-Pepa, as influences. Her second studio album [...] (2006) was influenced by Michael Jackson, Prince, and pop singer Madonna.|$|E

2500|$|In late 2014, whilst {{promoting}} the film Into the Woods, Tracey Ullman revealed plans {{to write something}} new for television in the following year. [...] "Every five years it comes to me to sort of <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> again and I throw a load of stuff at the wall, {{and some of it}} works and some of it obviously doesn't, but that's the nature of television. I love TV." [...] Her American Showtime series, Tracey Ullman's State of the Union ran for three seasons, concluding in 2010. It was a departure and a return of sorts. Instead of playing just original characters (a staple of Ullman's comedy) the show saw her imitating real people (celebrities, politicians, etc.) something she hadn't done since her early days at the BBC with Three of a Kind, the show that made her a household name in Great Britain.|$|E

Nelly doesn't really rap on this song, he's singing. He has that different style. That's kind of what the record is. We see that enough: R with a rapper feature.

[...] In an interview with the St. Joseph News-Press, Dylan stated that the Wallflowers would be getting into the studio in January and the lineup would include Greg Richling on bass, Rami Jaffee on keys, Stuart Mathis on guitar and Fred Eltringham on drums. [...] However, weeks before the Wallflowers began recording, Eltringham left the band to pursue other projects.
