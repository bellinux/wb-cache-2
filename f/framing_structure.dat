500|$|All the King's Men (1949) {{was based}} on the novel of the same name by Robert Penn Warren, which in turn {{was based on}} the career of the Louisiana {{politician}} Huey Long. Rossen introduced a new concept, that the defenders of the ordinary people can in turn become the new exploiters. As a requirement for his participation in the film, Rossen had to write to Columbia's Harry Cohn saying that he was no longer a Communist Party member. Cohn's critiques of the draft of Rossen's script included scrapping a <b>framing</b> <b>structure</b> that was difficult for audiences to follow and several improvements in the relationships and motivations of characters. A meeting of the Communist Party in Los Angeles severely criticized the film, and Rossen severed all relations with the Party. All the King's Men won the Academy Award for Best Picture, Broderick Crawford won the award for Best Actor and Mercedes McCambridge was honored as Best Supporting Actress. Rossen was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Director but lost to Joseph L. Mankiewicz for A Letter to Three Wives. Rossen won a Golden Globe for Best Director and the film won the Golden Globe for Best Picture. His next film, The Brave Bulls, was directed in 1950 and released in 1951. This was Rossen's last work before the studios blacklisted him. New York Times critic Bosley Crowther called this [...] "the best film on bull-fighting yet." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1959, two biographies were {{published}}: Anne Brontë, {{her life}} and work by Ada Harrison and Derek Stanford and Anne Brontë by Winifred Gérin. Noting that The Tenant was published some ten years before George Eliot's novels, Harrison and Stanford named Anne the [...] "first realist woman writer" [...] in Great Britain. Unlike some early critics, who considered the scenes of debauchery improbable, Harrison and Stanford believed them to be [...] "described in a fashion which Zola might have admired". Winifred Gérin believed Helen Graham to be [...] "one of the first married women in fiction who is both competent and resolved to keep herself not be any of the accepted means as housekeeper, companion or governess, but as a painter, selling her canvasses to dealers". Despite this, in her later work on the Brontës, Gérin dismissed The Tenant as being [...] "written too obviously {{as a work of}} propaganda, a treatise against drunkenness, to be considered a work of art". Several years later, however, Gérin wrote an introduction to The Tenant, where, while considering the framed structure in both The Tenant and Wuthering Heights a [...] "clumsy devise", acknowledged Anne's [...] "pre-eminent gift of story-teller" [...] and [...] "eloquence in proclaiming the equality of men and women". She believed that The Tenant [...] "might be said to be the first manifesto for 'Women's Lib'". Inga-Stina Ewbank considered Anne the least talented of the sisters and claimed that the <b>framing</b> <b>structure,</b> where [...] "Helen can reveal her innermost being to the diary" [...] while Gilbert is [...] "bound to be as objective as possible", [...] "throws novel out of balance". However, she believed that [...] "through the very nature of its central concern, The Tenant is feminist in the deepest sense of the word".|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> for {{spectrum}} sensing {{in a network}} of secondary users, and optimize the sum throughput of the network under the constraint on the aggregate interference offered by the network to the primary user. We contrast its performance with the traditional Stop And Sense (SAS) <b>frame</b> <b>structure,</b> which involves the secondary users stopping transmissions and sensing for spectrum holes. We obtain near-optimal, easily computable solutions for the sensing duration and sensing thresholds that approximately maximize the secondary throughput under an aggregate interference constraint. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we present a detailed comparison of the two schemes, and characterize the operating regimes where each <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> is preferable over the other. In general when switching latencies are not accounted for, {{we find that the}} proposed Simultaneous Sense and Access (SSA) <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> performs similar to the existing SAS <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> in terms of throughput for all values of primary signal SNR. When switching latencies are accounted for, the SSA <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> offers significantly higher throughput gain for all values of primary SNR. Another advantage of this <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> over a few other existing <b>frame</b> <b>structures</b> when employed in a network of secondary users {{is that it does not}} rely on the data in the previous slot to make decisions about the presence/absence of primary signal in the current slot which makes the <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> ideal for an adhoc network...|$|R

The dynamic characteristics and the seismic {{performance of the}} RAC <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> are analyzed and validated with the shaking table test results. Specifically, the natural frequency and the typical responses (e.g., storey deformation, capacity curve, etc.) from Model 1 (exclusion of strain rate effect) and Model 2 (inclusion of strain rate effect) are analyzed and compared. It is revealed that Model 2 {{is more likely to}} provide a better match between the numerical simulation and the shaking table test as key attributes of seismic behaviors of the <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> are captured by this model. For the purpose to examine how seismic behaviors of the RAC <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> vary under different strain rates in a real seismic situation, a numerical simulation is performed by varying the strain rate. The storey displacement response and the base shear for the RAC <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> under different strain rates are investigated and analyzed. It is implied that the structural behavior of the RAC <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> is significantly influenced by the strain rate effect. On one hand, the storey displacements vary slightly in the trend of decreasing with the increasing strain rate. On the other hand, the base shear of the RAC <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> under dynamic loading conditions increases with gradually increasing amplitude of the strain rate.|$|R

It can diminish the impact on environment, by avoiding to dug or fill the slope, using an opening platform, supported by beams and columns. Because the <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> on a slope connects with the ground on different elevation level, it is evidently different from general <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> in seismic design. Four sets of <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> example on a slope sample are designed, with three opening floors connected with the ground on different elevation level, and three, six, nine, twelve upper floors correspondingly.
