40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new acceleration technique for ray casting type volume rendering called IsoRegion Leaping. A factorization {{of the sample}} composition equation leads to our new algorithm {{which is based on}} homogeneity inside a volume. We create an IsoRegion data structure to help identifying homogeneous voxel cubes, which is independent of the viewing parameters and shading conditions, thus can be pre-processed. Accumulated colors and transparencies of <b>homogeneous</b> <b>ray</b> segments are pre-computed into a look-up table according to different voxel values and ray segment lengths. Attributes of ray segments piercing through IsoRegion blocks are looked-up from the table. Therefore, unnecessary sample compositions within IsoRegions are saved. This voxel leaping technique is experimentally proved to be efficient even for real-life medical volume data. A speedup of 2 to 3 times is measured while preserving the image quality. Images generated by our algorithm and the ones from the original algorithm without IsoRegion Leaping acceleration are identical, both theoretically and experimentally...|$|E

30|$|As {{could be}} seen from Fig.  4 a, hybrid poplar was a diffuse porous {{hardwood}} with slight difference between earlywood and latewood. The anatomic characteristics of the untreated hybrid poplar (<b>homogeneous</b> <b>rays,</b> thin-walled vessels and libriform fibers) {{were consistent with the}} results of the previous observations for poplars [40, 41]. The morphology of the compressed wood strongly depended upon the density (see Figs.  4 b–e). Comparing with Fig.  4 a, it {{could be seen}} that specimens of 0.60  g/cm 3 caused a deformation to the pores. The oval pores became irregular shapes, and the alignment had been tilted after compression. However, the pore size of the catheter did not change significantly (see Fig.  4 b- 3). The densities of 0.80 and 1.00  g/cm 3 were achieved a larger reduction in the void spaces of the wood (see Fig.  4 c, d). The high strain in the manufacturing process drastically reduced the volume of void spaces in the specimens and deformed the cell lumens. The width of vessels in both radial and tangential sections was narrowed during the compressing process. When the density of compreg reached to 1.20  g/cm 3, it had been very difficult to observe vessels in micrographs (see Fig.  4 e 1 – 3).|$|R
40|$|Species of Tachigali Aubl. have {{potential}} for reforestation and biofuel projects. However, {{information about the}} wood anatomy ofthis species is still very embryonic, hampering identification work. The objective {{of this study was}} to anatomically characterize sevenspecies of Tachigali available in the Walter. A. Egler wood collection of the Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi, thereby facilitating future identification work. The following species were studied: T. froesii (Pires) L. F. Gomes da Silva & H. C. Lima, T. melanocarpa (Ducke) Van Der Weff, T. paniculata Aubl., T. paraensis (Huber) Barneby, T. reticulosa (Dwyer) Zarucchi & Herend., T. setifera (Ducke) Zarucchi & Herend e T. tinctoria Bent. var. tinctoria (Benth.) Zarucchi & Herend. Analyses followed standard wood anatomy techniques and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). All species except T. froesii and T. melanocarpa present uniseriate and <b>homogeneous</b> <b>rays,</b> with the exceptions being heterogeneous. A vasicentric paratraqueal parenchyma is present in all the species, combined with another type of parenchyma. The pores are predominantly solitary, except in T. melanocarpa and T. reticulosa which have multiple pores. Tachigali froesii was the only species that presented enclosed bast and calcium carbonate crystals. The composition and organization of the ray cells, allied to the axial type of parenchyma, is important in distinguishing the peculiarity of each species...|$|R

40|$|An {{anatomical}} {{study of}} secondary phloem {{of the different}} species of Gymnosperms showed that three categories could be distinguished, which may represent three evolutionary stages. These three categories were: Pseudotsuga taxifolia type, to which belong many Pinaceae (while the other Pinaceae species belong to a subtype, e. g. the Tsuga canadensis subtype); Gingko biloba type, to which belong the Cycadaceae, Araucariaceae and many Podocarpaceae and Taxaceae; Chamaecyparis pisifera type, to which belong the Cupressaceae, Taxodiaceae {{and the rest of}} the Taxaceae and Podocarpaceae. The phylogenetic sequence of the axial system and the reduction of the phloem rays starts in the Ps. taxifolia type with an almost uniform axial system and ray- albuminous cells, and a complex heterogeneous phloem ray, differentiating through the G. biloba type to the C. pisifera type, which has a highly specialized axial system with phloem-albuminous cells and a simpler, reduced <b>homogeneous</b> phloem <b>ray.</b> The reduction of the phloem rays parallels the differentiation of the axial system...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Many {{species of}} the Fagaceae have been {{variously}} interpreted on the basis, primarily of external morphological characteristics. The objectives {{of this study are}} to elucidate generic and specific characteristics of the wood of Fagaceae and to attempt to obtain evidence regarding taxonomic relationships among some of the species occurring in Taiwan that have been variously interpreted. There are 45 species (Lin and Liu, 1965) of Fagaceae, subdivided to seven genera, in Taiwan and 35 of these were obtained for study. Detailed descriptions are provided for all species and differences among species and genera are emphasized. On the basis of comparative wood anatomy of the species studied, several suggestions are made regarding relationships of certain species. The wood anatomy of Pasania uraiana (Hay.) Schottky is very similar to that of Castanopsis and quite different from the anatomy of other species of Pasania or of Lithocarpus. The cupula is cuplike, however, so that it differs in this important generic character from Castanopsis. It probably should be treated under a distinct genus, Limlia, as Masamune and Tomiya (1947) suggested. The comparison of wood anatomy between Pasania dodoniaefolia and Pasania formosana shows consistent differences. Pasania dodoniaefolia shows distinct growth rings, <b>homogeneous</b> <b>rays</b> and absence of crystals in the parenchyma cells. Pasania formosana shows indistinct growth rings, heterogeneous rays and presence of crystals in parenchyma cells. Since the morphological characters are also somewhat different (Lin and Liu, 1965), they probably should be treated as two distinct species. Morphologically, Castanopsis carlesii var. sessilis is very similar to Castanopsis carlesii, but is quite different with regard to wood anatomy. Since Castanopsis carlesii var. sessilis has ring porous wood, conspicuous growth rings and pore size transition abrupt, while Castanopsis carlesii has diffuse porous wood, inconspicuous growth rings, pore size transition gradual, these should be considered as separate species and the original name, Castanopsis stipitata should be recognized as the valid name. The genera Lithocarpus and Pasania could not be separated anatomically. These genera have been separated primarily {{on the basis of the}} cupula but they are very similar with regard to other morphological characteristics. If both anatomy and external morphology are considered, these should be treated as one genus, Lithocarpus...|$|R

40|$|Some galaxy {{clusters}} show diffuse {{radio emission}} {{in the form}} of peripheral relics (so far attributed to primary, shock-(re) accelerated electrons) or central halos. Analysing radio and X-ray data from the literature, we find new connections between halos and relics, such as a universal linear relation between their peak radio brightness and the gas column density. Our results indicate that halos, relics, and halo-relic bridges in a cluster, all arise from the same, <b>homogeneous</b> cosmic <b>ray</b> (CR) ion (CRI) distribution. We analytically derive the signature of synchrotron emission from secondary electrons and positrons (CREs) produced in hadronic CRI collisions, for an arbitrary magnetic field evolution. In our model, flat spectrum halos (both giant and minihalos) arise from steady-state magnetic fields, whereas relics and steep halos reflect recent or irregular magnetic growth. This naturally explains the properties of halos, relics, and the connections between them, without invoking particle (re) acceleration in weak shocks or turbulence. We find CRI energy densities in the range u_p~ 10 ^-[12. 4, 13. 3]erg cm^- 3, with a spectral index s_p=- 2. 20 +- 0. 05, and identify a ~ 0. 1 magnetic energy fraction in some halos and behind relics, as far as 2 Mpc from the cluster's centre. The CRI homogeneity suggests strong CR diffusion, D(100 GeV) >~ 10 ^ 32 cm^ 2 s^- 1. The strong magnetisation imposes strict upper limits on > 10 GeV CRE (re) acceleration in weak shocks (efficiency < 10 ^- 4) and turbulence; indeed, each weak shock slightly lowers the energy fraction of flat CRs.

40|$|In high latitudes, {{magnetic}} disturbances {{attributable to}} intense electric currents {{in the upper}} atmosphere are known to occur simultaneously with visible aurora. With few exceptions past investigations have merely revealed statistically {{that the degree of}} magnetic disturbance is proportional to the intensity of auroral activity. In the research reported here, magnetic records and auroral observations from College (Fairbanks), Alaska have been studied in detail to determine the manner in which these phenomena are related. It is found that the relationships are quite definite and that practically all, if not all, disturbances may be represented in terms of two closely related patterns describing sequences of auroral activity which accompany positive and negative "bay" disturbances. Disturbances may appear extremely complicated due to repetition and overlapping of bays; examples are given to illustrate that these disturbances can be easily separated into individual bays by examining the sequence of auroral activity. A discontinuity in auroral activity occurs simultaneously with the reversal in direction of electric currents during the midnight hours; this feature indicates a dependence between the aurora and the electromotive force and thus contradicts a common opinion that aurora merely augments the conductivity. The pattern of behavior during magnetic storms preceded by sudden commencements is the same as on other nights. A preliminary analysis suggests that sudden commencements, reported on a world-wide scale, may be related to sudden changes from <b>homogeneous</b> to <b>rayed</b> aurora in the auroral zone. Special attention is given to: (1) the spatial association of aurora and electric currents, (2) a previously undescribed interval of +[Delta]H disturbance following negative bays, (3) auroral pulsations and movements, and (4) the repetition of similar features on consecutive nights. Theories and suggestions as to the cause of aurora and auroral zone currents are examined with reference to the present study...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the streaming and thermal instabilities of the electron-ion plasma with <b>homogeneous</b> cold cosmic <b>rays</b> drifting {{perpendicular to the}} background magnetic field in the multi-fluid approach. One-dimensional perturbations along the magnetic field are considered. The induced return current of the background plasma and back-reaction of cosmic rays are taken into account. It is shown that the cosmic ray back-reaction results in the streaming instability having considerably larger growth rates than that due to the return current of the background plasma. This increase is {{by a factor of}} the square root of the ratio of the background plasma mass density to the cosmic ray mass density. The maximal growth rates and corresponding wave numbers are found. The thermal instability is shown to be not subject to the action of cosmic rays in the model under consideration. The dispersion relation for the thermal instability includes ion inertia. In the limit of fast thermal energy exchange between electrons and ions, the isobaric and isochoric growth rates are derived.

Perturbations {{are considered to be}} also across the magnetic field. The back-reaction of cosmic rays resulting in strong streaming instabilities is taken into account. It is shown that for sufficiently short wavelength perturbations, the growth rates can exceed the growth rate of cosmic-ray streaming instability along the magnetic field found by Nekrasov & Shadmehri (2012), which is in its turn considerably larger than the growth rate of the Bell instability (2004). The thermal instability is shown not to be subject to the action of cosmic rays in the model under consideration. The dispersion relation for the thermal instability has been derived which includes sound velocities of plasma and cosmic rays, Alfvén and cosmic-ray streaming velocities. The relation between these parameters determines the kind of thermal instability ranging from the Parker (1953) to the Field (1965) instabilities.

40|$|Magnetised plasma {{permeates}} the Universe. It {{is present in}} stars, accretion discs, galaxies and clusters of galaxies. This dissertation investigates the characteristics of diffuse magnetised plasma in the inter-stellar-medium (ISM) and the intra-cluster-medium (ICM). To probe turbulence in the ISM and ICM, we develop an estimator for the magnetic tension-force spectrum. It is based on polarised synchrotron emission data in the Faraday-rotation-free frequency regime. The tension force is the dynamically most important magnetic force in subsonic magnetic turbulence. We consider two magnetic field scenarios: a statistically isotropic field distribution, and a statistically isotropic field upon a small mean field. In the latter case the magnetic power spectrum can also be obtained {{in addition to the}} tension-spectrum. The method is exact in the ideal case of a <b>homogeneous</b> cosmic <b>ray</b> electron distribution with a power law energy spectrum with a spectral index p= 3, and isotropic magnetic fields. The method is applied to mock observations based on magneto-hydrodynamic simulations as a prelude to an application to real observations. We confirm the robustness of the estimator by comparing its output to the corresponding quantities directly computed from the simulation. Furthermore, to investigate the global Galactic field we developed hammurabi. This software tool takes three-dimensional theoretical models for the ISM components and generates mock observations from them. It focuses on the main tracers of our Galactic magnetised plasma such as synchrotron flux, Faraday rotation, dispersion measure and ultra-high-energy-cosmic-ray delflections. Hammurabi therefore permits us to confront models of the Galactic magnetised plasma with a broad range of real observations. We report on a number of works based on this code. In particular, due to simultaneous constraints of rotation measure, polarised and total synchrotron intensity, as well as theoretical predictions on the magnetic field and cosmic-ray electron distribution, the Galactic electron density scale height was suggested to be about twice as large as previously thought. This result obtained with hammurabi was recently confirmed independently by other authors using pulsar dispersion measure data. Finally, we consider the role of the Galactic kinetic Sunyaev Zeldovich (kSZ) effect as a CMB foreground. We analyse the detectability of the Galactic kSZ effect by means of an optimally matched filter technique applied to a simulation of an ideal observation. We obtain a S/N ratio of 0. 1, and demonstrate thereby that the Galactic kSZ effect can safely be ignored as a CMB foreground. Furthermore, we rule out any significant contamination of the polarised CMB signal by second scattering of galactic kSZ photons...|$|R
40|$|That a thin refracting element {{can have}} a dioptric power which is {{asymmetric}} immediately raises questions at the fundamentals of linear optics.   In optometry the important concept of vergence, in particular, depends {{on the concept of}} a pencil of rays which in turn depends on the existence of a focus.   But systems that contain refracting elements of asymmetric power may have no focus at all.   Thus the existence of thin systems with asym-metric power forces one to go back to basics and redevelop a linear optics from scratch that is sufficiently general to be able to accommodate such systems.   This paper offers an axiomatic approach to such a generalized linear optics.   The paper makes use of two axioms: (i) a <b>ray</b> in a <b>homogeneous</b> medium is a segment of a straight line, and (ii) at an interface between two <b>homogeneous</b> media a <b>ray</b> refracts according to Snell’s equation.   The familiar paraxial assumption of linear optics is also made.   From the axioms a pencil of rays at a transverse plane T in a homogeneous medium is defined formally (Definition 1) as an equivalence relation with no necessary association with a focus.   At T the reduced inclination of a ray in a pencil is an af-fine function of its transverse position.   If the pencilis centred the function is linear.   The multiplying factor M, called the divergency of the pencil at T, is a real  2 2 ×  matrix.   Equations are derived for the change of divergency across thin systems and homogeneous gaps.   Although divergency is un-defined at refracting surfaces and focal planes the pencil of rays is defined at every transverse plane ina system (Definition 2).   The eigenstructure gives aprincipal meridional representation of divergency;and divergency can be decomposed into four natural components.   Depending on its divergency a pencil in a homogeneous gap may have exactly one point focus, one line focus, two line foci or no foci. Equations are presented for the position of a focusand of its orientation {{in the case of a}} line focus.   All possible cases are examined.   The equations allow matrix step-along procedures for optical systems in general including those with elements that haveasymmetric power.   The negative of the divergencyis the (generalized) vergence of the pencil. </p...|$|R
40|$|Maytenus guyanensis, conhecida popularmente por chichuá, possui ações analgésicas, antiinflamatórias, afrodisíacas e antireumáticas. Sendo assim foram estudados seus aspectos anatômicos e etnofarmacológicos a fim de se localizar sítios ou locais de produção da droga através dos testes microquímicos e traçar o perfil dos usuários e feirantes de produtos naturais nas feiras e mercados de Manaus-AM. Para análise anatômica do {{material}} coletado na Reserva Florestal Adolpho Ducke, foram selecionados 3 indivíduos e de cada um deles foram retirados fragmentos do caule e raiz de 1 cm 3. Fragmentos do caule foram incluídos em resina metacrilato para obtenção de cortes em micrótomo rotativo, os quais foram corados com azul de toluidina e montados em resina sintética. Seções do caule em crescimento secundário e da raiz foram obtidas com o auxílio de micrótomo de deslize e coradas com azul de astra e safranina. Os cortes histológicos do caule e raiz foram submetidos a testes microquímicos visando identificar a natureza química das substâncias secretadas. A investigação etnobotânica nas feiras e mercados foi realizada através de entrevistas, usando questionários com perguntas abertas e semi-estruturadas. A análise estrutural do caule e da raiz revelou-se de acordo com o registrado pela literatura para o gênero Maytenus. A periderme do caule origina-se na subepiderme, lenticelas estão presentes. A casca do caule secundário apresenta periderme desenvolvida constituída por felema espesso, seqüencialmente são observados o felogênio e feloderme. Córtex internamente rodeado por dois anéis esclerenquimáticos, sempre contínuo e composto por fibras e inúmeras células pétreas. Cilindro vascular com floema externo ao xilema, tecido floemático e xilemático entremeado com inúmeras fibras. O xilema secundário da raiz e do caule apresenta parênquima axial apotraqueal, raios multisseriados, heterogêneos, vasos solitários, de distribuição difusa, uniforme, seção circular, com parede delgada, pontoações intervasculares alternas e areoladas. O sistema floemático percorrido por grupos de células pétreas, células em processo de esclerificação, fibras e raios parenquimáticos. Medula homogênea formada de células parenquimáticas isodiamétricas e células pétreas. As estruturas do caule e da raiz apresentaram inúmeras células-pétreas e células em processo de esclerificação as quais possuem um lúmen denso que reagiu ao teste de alcalóides. Os testes microquímicos também revelaram a presença de amido, pectina e proteínas (somente no caule). Monocristais prismáticos estão presentes no parênquima radial da raiz e do caule. A pesquisa permitiu avaliar o perfil dos feirantes e usuários de plantas medicinais de Manaus-AM demonstrando que o comércio de fitoterápicos tem crescido nos últimos 10 anos através do aumento da procura de plantas medicinais. A abordagem etnofarmacológica realizada revelou que a espécie M. guyanensis não é comercializada e utilizada pelos feirantes, e sim uma outra espécie com o mesmo nome vulgar de chichuá, Salacia impressifolia. Contudo os informantes que conhecem as duas espécies afirmam que elas apresentam o mesmo uso terapêutico (relaxante muscular, reumatismo, impotência sexual e frigidez). O presente estudo vem enfatizar a importância da anatomia e da etnofarmacologia para o conhecimento das plantas medicinais.

Anatomical analysis of the material collected in the Forest Reserve Adolpho Ducke where conducted for 3 selected individuals, from which fragments of stem and root of 1 cm 3 had been removed. Fragments from stems were embedded in methacrylate resin for sectioning in a rotating microtome, stained with toluidine blue and mounted with synthetic resin. Sections from the stem in secondary growth and root were cut with slide microtome, and stained with astra blue and safranina. The histological cuts of stem and root were submitted to microchemical tests aiming the identification of the chemical properties of the secreted substances. The ethnobotanical aspects were studied through interviews carried in the fairs and markets of Manaus-AM, based on questionnaires with open and semi-structuralized questions. The structural analysis of stems and roots were in accordance with those showed in the literature available for the Maytenus genus. Periderm of stem arising in the sub-epidermis, lenticels is gifts. The bark of stem presented periderm developed constituted by a thick phellem, and subsequently to which the phellogen and phelloderm were observed. Vascular cylinder with phloem external to xylem, weaved phloematic and xylematic larded with innumerable staple fibres. The secondary xylem of the root and stem presented parenchyma axial apotracheal, multiseriates, heterogeneous rays, solitary vessels, of diffuse distribution, uniform, circular section, with thin wall, bordered and alternate intervascular pits. Cortex internally bounded by two sclerenchymatic rings, almost continuous and composed of fibers and innumerable stone cells. The phloem system has a group of stone cells, cells in process of sclerification, fibers and parenchyma <b>rays.</b> <b>Homogeneous</b> pith formed of isodiametric parenchyma cells and stone cells. Staple fibers and rays of the structures in stems and the root presented innumerable stone cells and cells in sclerification process, possessing a dense lumen reactive to alkaloids test. The microchemical tests also disclosed presence of starch, pectin and proteins (only in stem). Prismatic monocrystals were present in the radial parenchyma of roots and stems. The research on the profile of traders and users of medicinal plants in Manaus-AM revealed that the commerce of phytotherapics has grown in last the 10 years because of increasing search of medicinal plants. M. guyanensis is neither commercialized nor used for the traders, but instead another species bearing the same vulgar name of chichuá, Salacia impressifolia. Nevertheless, informers knowing both species affirmed that they are used in similar therapeutical treatments use (rheumatism, sexual impotence and frigidity).
