50|$|In the European mobile {{telecommunications}} sector, absent a {{bill and keep}} arrangement, the wholesale markets have traditionally applied the calling party pays (CPP) principle in which an originating network pays the terminating network a charge called the mobile termination rate (MTR) or <b>fixed</b> <b>termination</b> rate (FTR) for calls to the terminating network. The MTRs paid under the CPP model, therefore, act as a cost floor to the retail pricing, preventing lowering of prices and innovation of retail propostitions.

40|$|Purpose. A {{number of}} {{automated}} perimeters use the Zippy Estimation by Sequential Testing (ZEST) algorithm, {{which is an}} adaptive Bayesian method, for determining sensitivity measures. There are two popular rules for deciding when to terminate Bayesian procedures: (1) after a fixed number of presentations; or (2) when the probability density function (pdf) over all thresholds modified by the procedure becomes sufficiently narrow (a dynamic termination criterion). It has recently been argued that <b>fixed</b> <b>termination</b> criteria perform equally as well as dynamic criteria when applied in a fashion typical of laboratory-based visual psychophysics. Perimetry, however, has specific requirements; the tests must be very short, {{there is a wide}} range of possible sensitivities, and erroneous responses from the patient must be tolerated. This study used computer simulation to compare fixed and dynamic termination criteria for the ZEST algorithm using conditions typical of white-on-white perimetry. Methods. Eight ZEST procedures were compared using the following termination criteria: <b>fixed</b> <b>termination</b> after 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 presentations; dynamic termination when the standard deviation of the pdf was 1 dB, 1. 5 dB, and 2 dB.

Current methods to accurately define kinetic rate parameters such as Kon and Koff are time and labor intensive, prompting the development of a screening assay to identify slowly dissociating com-pounds for follow-up rate constant determination. The authors measured inhibition binding constants (Ki) for GnRH recep-tor antagonists after 30 min and 10 h of incubation and observed several compounds with markedly decreased Ki values over time (Ki 30 min/Ki 10 h> 6).

These so-called termination charges are controversial from a policy perspective since they are fairly high and stable. We present a model of consumer and firm behavior in mobile markets {{in order to identify}} the role of termination charges in determining the market equilibrium. We analyze three segments of the mobile market: termination, calling, and subscribing. Our model predicts a “waterbed effect”, that is, high termination rates will be associated with low subscription prices, if preferences are the primary source of variation in termination rates. If costs are the main driver of termination rates our model predicts a “tide ” hypothesis in which high termination rates exist alongside high subscription prices. We test these and other predictions from our model using international data on mobile subscriptions per person. We find results which are broadly consistent with our model. More specifically, we find evidence that mobile termination rates are positive and significantly related to mobile phone adoption. This result is robust to the inclusion of a variety of other structural, institutional, demographic, and income controls. We also find that competition, internet subscriptions, and a free press are positively associated with mobile phone adoption while <b>fixed</b> <b>termination</b> rates and inequality slow the adoption of mobile technologies...|$|E

40|$|Motivation, {{background}} and problem statement: Fixed and mobile broadband substitutability {{has recently been}} a debate in the telecom industry as the issue affects infrastructure investment decisions of service providers and service obligation regulation decision of telecom authorities. Previous studies have debated over both the definition of substitutability, measurement and the conclusions. Theoretically, substitution is the demand side concept measured using the cross-price elasticity. With a unique dataset, this study takes a simpler approach to examine the fixed-to-mobile substitution. Instead of examining the problem through the estimation of cross-price elasticity, this study estimates the impact of users 2 ̆ 019 mobile broadband subscription on their decision to terminate fixed broadband subscription. Data and methodology: The data {{used in this study}} are from the 2016 Telecom Consumption Survey of Thailand by the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission of Thailand. This study estimates the fixed to mobile substitution using the concept of average treatment effect of mobile broadband usage on the <b>fixed</b> broadband <b>termination.</b> Without random assignment, the estimation of factors determining the <b>fixed</b> broadband <b>termination</b> decision, focusing on the mobile broadband subscription, faces the endogeneity problem. Therefore, we applied the endogenous switching Probit model to estimate the average treatment effect. Results and concluding remarks: From the survey, 1949 respondents subscribed to a fixed broadband service at home at one point. Among them, 85. 48 percent remain subscribed to the service and 14. 52 percent has canceled the service prior to 2016. The regression analysis shows that mobile broadband subscription has a positive significant effect on the decision to cancel fixed broadband service. The contribution of the study lies on the heterogeneity of the level of fixed to mobile substitution across different groups of internet users. For those who are online for less than 40 hours per day, mobile broadband is considered as a substitute for fixed broadband to a certain level. For those whose lifestyle requires a higher usage of internet, the results show no substitution. As telecom regulations normally target to help users with lower telecom accessibility rather than those with higher level of usage, the higher level of fixed and mobile substitution for individuals with low usage should imply the possibility to unify regulatory framework for fixed and mobile broadband markets...|$|R

Heat shock treatment of these cells rapidly induced high levels of RAG transcripts and RAG proteins that were accompanied by a parallel induction of V(D) J recombinase activity, strongly suggesting that RAG proteins have a primary role in V(D) J recombination. Within hours after induction, these cells began to rearrange chromosomally integrated V(D) J recombination substrates but only if the substrates contained an active transcriptional enhancer; substrates lacking an enhancer were not efficiently rearranged. Activities necessary to target integrated substrates for rearrangement were provided by two separate lymphoid-specific transcriptional enhancers, as well as an active nonlymphoid enhancer, unequivocally demonstrating that such elements enhance both transcription and V(D) J recombinational accessibility...|$|R

40|$|It is broadly {{accepted}} that mobile network operators are monopolists when {{they set the}} termination rate for the calls made to their own network.

Hence, mobile network operators can <b>fix</b> high fixed-to-mobile <b>termination</b> rates. We propose a policy to overcome this termination bottleneck imposing reciprocity between the mobile-to-fixed and fixed-to-mobile termination rates and relaxing the interconnection obligation. First, we consider a benchmark where mobile-tofixed termination rates are regulated at cost and fixed and mobile network operators negotiate the fixed-to-mobile termination rate.

RNA-Seq was conducted on one pair of morphologically distinct sister populations inhabiting surface and cave habitats to identify genes that were differentially expressed in the two populations, {{as well as to}} compare levels and patterns of genetic variation within and between populations. Of the 104, 630 transcripts identified in the transcriptome assembly, 57 % had higher average levels of expression in the cave population. After Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple tests, 1517 and 551 transcripts were significantly upregulated or downregulated, respectively, in the cave population, indicating an almost three-fold enrichment of cave-upregulated genes. The average level of nucleotide diversity across all transcripts was significantly lower in the cave population. Within the cave population, where the average nucleotide diversity of cave-downregulated transcripts was 75 % that of the cave-upregulated transcripts, a highly significant difference, whereas within the spring population the nucleotide diversities of cave-downregulated and cave-upregulated transcripts was virtually identical. Three lines of evidence suggest that the reduced variation in cave downregulated transcripts is due to positive selection in the cave population: 1) the average neutrality index of cave-downregulated genes was < 1, consistent with positive selection, and significantly less than that of cave-upregulated genes; 2) Tajima's D was positively correlated with the cave:surface expression ratio, and 3) cave-downregulated transcripts {{were significantly more likely to}} be highly diverged from their surface homologs than cave-upregulated transcripts.

6000|$|... 1132. The {{advantages}} {{of this form}} of trough are very numerous and great. i. It is exceedingly compact, for 100 pairs of plates need not occupy a trough of more than three feet in length, ii. By Dr. Hare's plan of making the trough turn upon copper pivots which rest upon copper bearings, the latter afford fixed terminations; and these I have found it very convenient to connect with two cups of mercury, fastened {{in the front of}} the stand of the instrument. These <b>fixed</b> <b>terminations</b> give the great advantage of arranging an apparatus to be used in connexion with the battery before the latter is put into action, iii. The trough is put into readiness for use in an instant, a single jug of dilute acid being sufficient for the charge of 100 pairs of four-inch plates, iv. On making the trough pass through a quarter of a revolution, it becomes active, and the great advantage is obtained of procuring for the experiment the effect of the first contact of the zinc and acid, which is twice or sometimes even thrice that which the battery can produce a minute or two after (1036. 1150.). v. When the experiment is completed, the acid can be at once poured from between the plates, so that the battery is never left to waste during an unconnected state of its extremities; the acid is not unnecessarily exhausted; the zinc is not uselessly consumed; and, besides avoiding these evils, the charge is mixed and rendered uniform, which produces a great and good result (1039.); and, upon proceeding to a second experiment, the important effect of first contact is again obtained. vi. The saving of zinc is very great. It is not merely that, whilst in action, the zinc performs more voltaic duty (1128. 1129.), but all the destruction which takes place with the ordinary forms of battery between the experiments is prevented. This saving is of such extent, that I estimate the zinc in the new form of battery to be thrice as effective as that in the ordinary form. vii. The importance of this saving of metal is not merely that the value of the zinc is saved, but that the battery is much lighter and more manageable; and also that the surfaces of the zinc and copper plates may be brought much nearer to each other when the battery is constructed, and remain so until it is worn out: the latter is a very important advantage (1148.). viii. Again, as, in consequence of the saving, thinner plates will perform the duty of thick ones, rolled zinc may be used; and I have found rolled zinc superior to cast zinc in action; a superiority which I incline to attribute to its greater purity (1144.). ix. Another advantage is obtained in the economy of the acid used, which is proportionate to the diminution of the zinc dissolved. x. The acid also is more easily exhausted, and is in such small quantity that there is never any occasion to return an old charge into use. The acid of old charges whilst out of use, often dissolves portions of copper from the black flocculi usually mingled with it, which are derived from the zinc; now any portion of copper in solution in the charge does great harm, because, by the local action of the acid and zinc, it tends to precipitate upon the latter, and diminish its voltaic efficacy (1145.). xi. By using a due mixture of nitric and sulphuric acid for the charge (1139.), no gas is evolved from the troughs; so that a battery of several hundred pairs of plates may, without inconvenience, be close to the experimenter. xii. If, during a series of experiments, the acid becomes exhausted, it can be withdrawn, and replaced by other acid with the utmost facility; and after the experiments are concluded, the great advantage of easily washing the plates is at command. And it appears to me, that in place of making, under different circumstances, mutual sacrifices of comfort, power, and economy, to obtain a desired end, all are at once obtained by Dr. Hare's form of trough.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Ca 2 {{release from}} cardiac sarcoplasmic {{reticulum}} (SR) via ryanodine receptors (RyRs) is regulated by dyadic cleft [Ca 2] and intra-SR free [Ca 2] ([Ca 2]SR). Robust SR Ca 2 release termination {{is important for}} stable excitation–contraction coupling, and partial [Ca 2]SR depletion may contribute to release termination. Here, we investigated the regulation of SR Ca 2 release termination of spontaneous local SR Ca 2 release events (Ca 2 sparks) by [Ca 2]SR, release flux, and intra-SR Ca 2 diffusion. We simultaneously measured Ca 2 sparks and Ca 2 blinks (localized elementary [Ca 2]SR depletions) in permeabilized ventricular cardiomyocytes {{over a wide range}} of SR Ca 2 loads and release fluxes. Sparks terminated via a [Ca 2]SR-dependent mechanism at a fixed [Ca 2]SR depletion threshold independent of the initial [Ca 2]SR and release flux. Ca 2 blink recovery depended mainly on intra-SR Ca 2 diffusion rather than SR Ca 2 uptake. Therefore, the large variation in Ca 2 blink recovery rates at different release sites occurred because of differences in the degree of release site interconnection within the SR network. When SR release flux was greatly reduced, long-lasting release events occurred from well-connected junctions. These junctions could sustain release because local SR Ca 2 release and [Ca 2]SR refilling reached a balance, preventing [Ca 2]SR from depleting to the termination threshold. Prolonged release events eventually terminated at a steady [Ca 2]SR, indicative of a slower, [Ca 2]SR-independent termination mechanism. These results demonstrate that there is high variability in local SR connectivity but that SR Ca 2 release terminates at a <b>fixed</b> [Ca 2]SR <b>termination</b> threshold. Thus, reliable SR Ca 2 release termination depends on tight RyR regulation by [Ca 2]SR. (Circ Res. 2008; 103 :e 105 -e 115.)

By what rule of right, for instance, are the inhabitants of Upper Canada called upon to pay for the redemption of the seigniorial tenure of Lower Canada; and what right has Lower Canada to be called upon to meet the extravagant municipal indebtness of Upper Canada? If our difficulties arise from differences of language and races, how comes it that the English-speaking people of Lower Canada have so long harmonized and sympathised with the extreme Ultramontane party of Lower Canada? (HEAR, HEAR.) I think you cannot find any reason for it, except on the supposition that they remain united for the purpose of maintaining their sectional power and influence, under a system by which the common exchequer is deemed a legitimate object of public plunder. Each section seems to have always regarded the public chest as fair game; and it is undeniable that Lower Canada has generally had the best of it. These things caused dissatisfaction in the minds of people from other sections of the country, and they undertake to form combinations for the purpose of obtaining from the public chest similar undue advantages. The remedy for this state of things is to deprive the Legislature of the power to make grants for local objects.

[...] (LAUGHTER.) The idea seems to prevail, that in this country even the grass cannot grow unless growth is regulated by an Act of Parliament. No change in the Constitution of this country will remedy the difficulties of which you complain, for they have their source within ourselves. It is honest, economical administration you require, not legislation, or a change in our form of Government."'Bout forms of government let fools contest, That which is best administered is best."You may remove your seat of government to Ottawa, and increase your Legislature from 130 to 194 members, but you will find the same difficulties under any system of government which you may adopt, so long as you continue extravagant sectional expenditure. Those difficulties will still meet you in the face, so long as the legislature or legislatures of the country are permitted to exercise functions that do not properly belong to a general government; so long as you refuse to compel localities to meet their own local expenditure by local means, you will find the same causes producing the same effects in Ottawa as in Quebec. Colum non animam mutant qui trans mare currunt. (You but change your skies by the proposed constitutional changes.) I remarked, at the outset, that I must deny to this House the right to impose on this country this or any other Constitution, without first obtaining the consent of the people. Who sent you here to frame a Constitution? You were sent here to administer the Constitution as you find it. Throughout the length and breadth of British North America, there is not one other government that has dared to arrogate to itself the right of changing the Constitution of their people without consulting them, except ours. I am surprised, sir, that even this strong Government of ours have dared to assume this power, when, sooner or later, they must go before the people of the country. (HEAR, HEAR.) There comes to my hand, this evening, a resolution proposed by the Honourable Attorney General of Newfoundland in the Legislature of that colony. It is instructive as showing that there was one uniform sentiment throughout all the Lower Provinces, in favour of submitting the question to the people. It was so submitted in New Brunswick—it met its fate. It is now about to be submitted to the people of Nova Scotia. The Administration of this province have been wiser in their generation than those of the Lower Provinces. They did not dare submit it for the consideration of the people — a course which, if not exhibiting wisdom on their part, shows, at least, that skill and craft in public matters for which most of them have become famous. (HEAR, HEAR.) The resolution I have referred to, and which embodies the policy of the Government of Newfoundland on this question, is as follows:—Resolved,—That having had under their most serious and deliberate consideration the proposal for the formation of a Federal union of the British North American Provinces, upon the terms contained in the report of the Convention of delegates, held at Quebec, on the 10th of October last—the despatch of the right Honourable the Secretary of State for the Colonies, dated December 3, 1864—the observations of His Excellency the Governor in relation to this subject in his opening Speech of the present session—and the report of the Newfoundland delegates—this committee are of the opinion, that having regard to the comparative novelty and very great importance of this project, it is desirable that before a vote of the Legislature is taken upon it, it should be submitted to the consideration of the people at large, particularly as the action of the other provinces does not appear to require that it should be hastily disposed of, and as (the present being the last session of this Assembly) no unreasonable delay can be occasioned by this course; and they, therefore, recommend that a final determination upon this important subject be differed to the next meeting of the Legislature. (HEAR, HEAR.)AN HON. MEMBER—That is the report of a committee.MR. O'HALLORAN—Yes, it is the report of a committee; but it was submitted to the Legislature by the Hon. Attorney General as the policy of the Government. Of course, if the resolution is not carried in the Legislature, then the scheme is doubly defeated. In this little, petty province, whose interests, as compared with ours, are of trifling importance in relation to the scheme, the Government considers that the question is one of sufficient moment to demand that before the slightest action is taken upon it by the Legislature, the people should be consulted; but in this large province, with its comparatively large population, and with important interests to be affected, the scheme is to be hurried through without allowing the people to have a voice in the matter, or even to have time for its consideration. (HEAR, HEAR.) They are to have no voice in determining what kind of government they and their children are to live under for years to come. Mr. Speaker, I know very well that it is a bold declaration for me to make, that this Parliament has no right to deal with this question; but, sir, I make it not hastily nor unadvisedly, because I defy honourable gentlemen to find a precedent for their proposed action in any free country under similar circumstances. We are not living to-day in a time of revolution or of great emergency; but even if our circumstances weredifferent, I doubt very much if any of the precedents that have been referred to, as having occurred many years ago and in troublous times, could again be practiced or adopted, even in England, from which country we draw all our precedents. The precedents which have been invoked in approval of the course that has been adopted by the Government prove too much. If they form a justification for the course we are pursuing, then you might prove by the same means that this House had the power to perpetuate its existence beyond the limit <b>fixed</b> for the <b>termination</b> of the present Parliament, or vote ourselves members for life. We might just as well constitute ourselves life members of the Federal Legislature of the proposed Confederacy, as to take the action that is contemplated. I know that it is represented as very important that the measure should be carried into immediate operation; but that is a matter of mere expediency, and has nothing to do with constitutional principles. (HEAR, HEAR.) The Irish union has been triumphantly referred to as a precedent for this measure. To my mind it is a most unfortunate one, and little deserving of our imitation. Let me show you how this matter has been regarded by one, whose authority will not be disputed. I read from May's Constitutional History of England, page 505 of the 2nd volume. Speaking of the union of Ireland with England, he says:A great end was compassed by means the most base and shameless. Grattan, Lord Charlemont, Ponsonby, Plunkett, and a few patriots, continued to protest against the sale of the liberties and free Constitution of Ireland. Their eloquence and public virtue command the respect of posterity; but the wretched history of their country denies them its sympathy.This, sir, is the judgement of the impartial English historian upon the means by which this great national crime was consummated, and it is the just encomium on the noble few whose patriotic efforts failed to prevent it. I read it, in anticipation, as the future history of the wrong now about to be perpetrated on the people of this country; and while it implies, on the one hand, in no doubtful terms, the well-merited praise of the small band who stand here tonight for the rights of the people, in opposition to this scheme, it pronounces, on the other, the just condemnation of those who trample on those rights, and who forget, in the pride of their brief authority, who it was that raised them to the positions they occupy, not that they might coerce, but carry out the will of the people, the only rightful source of political power.
