Pooled data for the 15 members of the European Union except Luxembourg and five other OECD countries serves to answer these questions. Three basic conclusions emerge. First, fiscal policy responds to the ratio of public debt to output in a stabilizing manner. Second, coordinated macroeconomic policy exists: <b>easy</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> leads to tight monetary policy, and easy monetary policy to tight fiscal policy. Third, both monetary and fiscal policy respond to the cycle in a stabilizing manner, but automatic stabilization through fiscal policy is much weaker than generally perceived. Expansion raises tax receipts but also government expenditures. The destabilizing response on the expenditure side is also extremely marked.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the stabilizing effects of Swiss <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy.</b> First, {{we find that}} the federation adopted a countercyclical <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> in approximately 60 % of all periods observed.

What are the practical challenges which may arise in implementing sound <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> under a budgeting system which is significantly more complex than traditional cash budgeting? These are the primary questions addressed in this paper. Because any budgeting system must support the control of key <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> aggregates, the paper also considers the case for reformulating <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> in terms of accrual rather than cash aggregates. The primary {{focus is on the}} potential <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> role of net lending and net financial debt. However, the paper also considers whether net worth is an aggregate with major <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> relevance. <b>Fiscal</b> sustainability;Fiscal stability;Government expenditures;Asset management;expenditure, <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy,</b> capital expenditure, aggregate expenditure, budget balance, fiscal aggregates, expenditure control, total expenditure, aggregate demand, discretionary <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy,</b> <b>fiscal</b> stabilization, fiscal measures, expenditure appropriation, fiscal balance, budgetary control, public expenditure, annual budget, <b>fiscal</b> position, <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> objectives, tax payments, public debt, budget deficit, fiscal sustainability measure, budgetary expenditure, fiscal operations, fiscal sustainability analysis, input mix, expenditure <b>policies,</b> <b>fiscal</b> targets, fiscal discipline, public spending, fiscal affairs department, fiscal stimulus, debt obligations, budget deficits, fiscal affairs, fiscal transparency, budget law, <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies,</b> expenditure priorities, <b>fiscal</b> crisis, tax multiplier, budgetary impact, interest expenditure, sustainable <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy,</b> budget constraint, <b>fiscal</b> impact, tax revenues, government budget, tax liability, government budgeting, expenditure plans, expenditure controls, fiscal measure, expenditure decisions, fiscal aggregate, fiscal studies, expenditures, budget preparation process, expenditure obligations, primary budget balance, efficiency of expenditure, government budget deficits, budget process, taxation, aggregate fiscal...|$|R

In this paper, the conduct of optimal <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> under EMU is considered. Tax/spending policies, public debt management, {{the creation of a}} fiscal "reserve fund" and the politics of <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> are discussed in turn. It is recommended that <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> should be more strongly countercyclical, the public debt portfolio be redesigned to hedge macroeconomic risk and a fiscal reserve fund be considered. In addition, the budgetary process should be redesigned to better enable the finance minister to implement the optimal <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy...</b>|$|R
40|$|In Europe, neither {{unemployment}} rates nor institutions are uniform. In the EMU, countries have coordinated their monetary <b>policy,</b> and <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> might follow. Does convergence in <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> imply that {{unemployment rates}} will converge, too, or is diversified <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> desirable? An {{answer to this}} question requires insight into the dependence on <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> of the unemployment rate in equilibrium. This study estimates the equilibrium rate of unemployment and shows that it has been affected significantly by taxes and benefits. Uniform <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> would not, however, harmonise the unemployment rates because the impact of policy varies widely across the OECD economies. ...|$|R
