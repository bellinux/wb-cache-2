5|$|Both Titus and Domitian were fond of gladiatorial games, and {{realised}} {{its importance}} {{to appease the}} citizens of Rome. In the newly constructed Colosseum, the Flavians provided for spectacular entertainments. The Inaugural games of the Flavian Amphitheatre lasted for a hundred days and {{were said to be}} extremely elaborate, including gladiatorial combat, fights between wild animals (elephants and cranes), mock naval battles for which the theatre was flooded, horse races and chariot races. During the games, wooden balls were dropped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience,</b> inscribed with various prizes (clothing, gold, or even slaves), which could then be traded for the designated item.|$|E
5|$|The sixth {{match was}} between Triple H and Umaga, voted by the fans to be a Street Fight, where the match {{could take place}} {{anywhere}} in the arena, and any weapon could be used. The match began in the entrance area and involved Umaga getting speared through the stage setting. The match moved to <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> {{before returning to the}} ring. Several weapons were used, and Umaga splashed Triple H through an announce table. The match ended when Triple H hit Umaga with a sledgehammer and performed a Pedigree to score the victory via pinfall. Mickie James was then announced to be the winner of the Divas Halloween costume contest.|$|E
5|$|The rig {{consisted}} of a Front of House truss, two three-quarter angled trusses, and two straight mid-stage trusses. These were all located up-stage, and had two sub-hung trusses directly below them. There were two Lycian Starklite medium-throw truss spots, and an accumulation of specialty lights. The specialty lights included 54 two-light Molefays, six PAR 36 rotating beacons, 24 Martin Atomic 300 Strobes, 2 six-light Molefays, and 10 four-light Molefays. The rig also had LED units, which can be very bright, and which shone <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b> Throughout the tour, 65 Philips Color Kinetics ColorBlast 12s, seven Color Blaze 48s, and twelve CK ColorBlaze 72s were used to light up {{the wall behind the}} band.|$|E

5|$|With the bar full, {{the guys}} begin their routine, but are soon {{stopped by the}} police, who explain that due to zoning regulations, {{stripping}} is illegal at The Warsaw. Drew and the guys go before the city council, but their request is denied. Drew questions how the council can deny something without seeing it and the guys, including Lewis, decide to demonstrate their striptease routine before the council members. Their request is then approved. After performing the striptease at the bar, Drew counts out the money and finds that they have $4,800. Mr. Wick asks {{what they should do}} with the extra money and Drew replies that they should give it to the people that earned it. He then walks off stage and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> and starts handing out the extra cash, apologising for them having seen his naked buttocks.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was the Triple Threat {{match for the}} WWE Championship between {{champion}} John Cena, Edge, and Triple H. As the match began, Edge chose to stand outside the ring, hoping that Cena and Triple H would simply fight the match themselves. Cena and Triple H, however, teamed up and turned against Edge. One spot in the match saw Edge catapult Triple H into the steel ringpost, which made Triple H bleed. Afterwards, Edge executed an Edgecution onto an announce table on Triple H and then focused on Cena. Cena, however, locked Edge in the STFU, but was broken when Triple H hit Cena {{in the head with}} a microphone. Triple H then went after Edge and hit him with a chair, sending him over the security wall and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b> Lita, who accompanied Edge, entered the ring with a chair to hit Triple H, but Triple H reversed it into a Spinebuster, a move where the wrestler lifts the opponent, turning 180°, and then tosses her forward onto her back. Near the end of the match, Cena attempted an FU on Edge but Triple H delivered a low blow to Cena, which made Cena drop Edge out of the ring and attempted to execute a Pedigree. Cena, however, countered it into a jackknife roll-up. Cena won the match and successfully retained the WWE Championship. After the match, Triple H hit Cena, Edge, and the referee with a sledgehammer, and performed his signature taunt until performing his signature DX cross chops, receiving a standing ovation from the audience, closing the show.|$|E

5000|$|... “Poetic theatre {{attempts}} to find clarity through ambiguity. It’s not verse theatre or prose theatre or journalistic theatre. It’s theatre that treats the text as a score ... and treats the gap between actor and audience not {{as an obstacle to}} bypass, but as a medium through which multiple meanings can emerge. There’s a difference between shining a light directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience’s</b> eyes, and having it pass through a prism.” ...|$|R

25|$|The fifth annual Gathering of the Juggalos {{returned}} to Garrettsville the following year, with over 5,000 in attendance. Ol' Dirty Bastard, Kurupt, Tech N9ne, and Wolfpac {{were among those}} who performed. Kurupt got booed off the stage by the attendees, and retaliated by throwing a microphone <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b> Bone Thugs-n-Harmony also re-united {{for the first time}} in several months by making a surprise performance on opening night. Juggalo Championship Wrestling hosted matches every day, and featured several established wrestlers.|$|E
50|$|Believability is a {{necessary}} but not a sufficient condition for an effective campaign. If believability of messages is low, change will probably not occur because the persuasive messages are falling <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience's</b> latitude of rejection. In other words, <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> will reject <b>the</b> message without even considering it. It {{is also important to}} note, however, that if believability is extremely high (e.g., over 90%), change is also unlikely to occur because the message is not challenging enough. In other words, it serves only as a reinforcement rather than an element of change. Thus, while there are no specific guidelines, it is ideal to aim for believability above 50%.|$|R
25|$|M-1 {{joined the}} International People's Democratic Uhuru Movement in Chicago for three years, stic.man {{remained}} in Florida. Burned {{out by the}} arduous labor of Uhuru, M-1 and stic.man chose to focus on music. Brand Nubian's Lord Jamar discovered them in New York City and signed them a deal with Loud Records. Although dead prez was not always Loud's top priority, they built a fan base due to their over-the-top performances (they've been known to ignite dollar bills and toss apples <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>audiences,</b> declaring that they must eat healthily).|$|R
5000|$|This {{nickname}} {{is based}} on a pun with the Japanese verb 持てる (moteru), which means to be well liked or popular (or to have something). A second way to read Moteuchi would be [...] "Motenai," [...] which is the negative conjugation for moteru (in other words, to not have something). An attempt to get the joke across to English speaking audiences was made by Ai, who reads his name and declares, [...] "Motenai?!? As in LOSER?" [...] Yota corrects her, but the image has already been planted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience's</b> mind.|$|R
25|$|Since their {{introduction}} in the mid-1980s, in-ear monitors {{have grown}} {{to be the most}} popular monitoring choice for large touring acts. The reduction or elimination of loudspeakers other than instrument amplifiers on stage has allowed for cleaner and less problematic mixing situations for both the front of house and monitor engineers. Audio feedback is greatly reduced and there is less sound reflecting off the back wall of the stage out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience,</b> which affects the clarity of the mix the front of house engineer is attempting to create.|$|E
25|$|Although the poses plastiques {{were never}} {{considered}} a serious form of art, Nicholson's version {{has been described}} as the most low brow form that it took. A writer visiting from France published a critical account of the show, characterising it as a pretentious form of entertainment. It was also criticised by English social reformers, who characterized the acts as a form of prostitution. After Nicholson moved his events to the Coal Hole tavern, the management officially stopped allowing women <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> in order to fight this perception. However, some women were still able to gain entry to the events.|$|E
25|$|She {{participated in}} a war bond selling {{campaign}} with a sailor named Eddie Rhodes. Rhodes was in the crowd at each Lamarr appearance, and she would call him up on stage. She would briefly flirt with him before asking the audience if she should give him a kiss. The crowd would of course say yes, to which Hedy would reply that she would if enough people bought war bonds. After enough bonds were purchased, she would give Rhodes his kiss, and he would head back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b> Then they would head off to the next war bond rally.|$|E

5|$|Demosthenes {{tailored}} {{his style}} {{to be very}} audience-specific. He took pride in not relying on attractive words but rather simple, effective prose. He was mindful of his arrangement, he used clauses to create patterns that would make seemingly complex sentences easy for the hearer to follow. His tendency to focus on delivery promoted him to use repetition, this would ingrain <b>the</b> importance <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience's</b> minds; he also relied on speed and delay to create suspense and interest among <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> when presenting to most important aspects of his speech. One of his most effective skills was his ability to strike a balance: his works were complex so that <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> would not be offended by any elementary language, {{but the most important}} parts were clear and easily understood.|$|R

25|$|Unlike other Cirque du Soleil performances, Kà offers four pre-shows. Once {{the house}} opens, guests are {{greeted by the}} villagers of Kà ("Gatekeepers"). Twenty minutes before curtain, two musicians enter the lobby and climb up to two {{stringed}} instruments specially designed for Kà and integrated into the architecture. Ten minutes before the show, actors appear in the metal framework {{to the left and}} right of the stage and perform flips and leaps assisted with ropes to dive <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> and attempt to scare viewers. Five minutes before showtime, a staged act informs the audience that there is no flash photography or cell phone usage allowed.|$|E
25|$|A {{performance}} of Faust begins with Christine singing {{the lead role}} of Marguerite ("Ah! Do I Hear My Lover's Voice?"). However, during the song there's an unscheduled blackout and when the lights come back up, Christine has disappeared. The show quickly adjourns {{and the rest of}} the cast search high and low for her all over the Opera House, taking their lanterns <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> ("No Sign! I See No Sign!"). But to no avail. The scene switches to The Phantom's underground domain where he has kidnapped Christine in his boat and ties her to a post at his mist-shrouded dock before rowing slowly back into the darkness, leaving Christine behind ("Somewhere Above The Sun Shines Bright").|$|E
25|$|From the outset, {{they adopted}} the {{philosophy}} espoused by esoteric novel series The Illuminatus! Trilogy, gaining notoriety for various anarchic situationist manifestations, including the defacement of billboard adverts, the posting of prominent cryptic advertisements in NME {{magazine and the}} mainstream press, and highly distinctive and unusual performances on Top of the Pops. Their most notorious performance was a collaboration with Extreme Noise Terror (and Barney Greenaway of Napalm Death) at the February 1992 BRIT Awards, where they fired machine gun blanks <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> and dumped a dead sheep at the aftershow party. This performance announced the KLF's departure from the music business, and in May 1992 the duo deleted their entire back catalogue.|$|E
40|$|Persuasion is a {{fundamental}} part of social activity, yet it is rarely studied by economists. We compare the traditional economic model, in which persuasion is communication of objectively valuable information, with a behavioral model, in which persuasion {{is an effort to}} fit <b>the</b> message <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience’s</b> already held beliefs. We present a simple formalization of the behavioral model, and compare the two models using data on financial advertising in Money and Business Week magazines {{over the course of the}} internet bubble. The evidence on the content of the persuasive messages is broadly consistent with the behavioral model of persuasion...|$|R
50|$|Surtitles {{are used}} either to {{translate}} the meaning of <b>the</b> lyrics <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience's</b> language, or to transcribe lyrics that {{may be difficult to}} understand in the sung form. The two possible types of presentation of surtitles are as projected text, or as the electronic libretto system. Titles in the theatre have proven a commercial success in areas such as opera, and are finding increased use for allowing hearing impaired patrons to enjoy theatre productions more fully. Surtitles are used in live productions {{in the same way as}} subtitles are used in movie and television productions.|$|R
