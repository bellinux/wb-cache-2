5|$|After {{decades of}} {{planning}} and construction the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) is a next generation detector for the new proton-proton collider (7 TeV + 7 TeV) called the Large <b>Hadron</b> Collider (LHC) which is now operational in the existing 17mi (27km) circular underground tunnel near Geneva, Switzerland at CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics. Florida State University faculty members collaborated in the design, construction and operation of the LHC, with some components assembled at Florida State and shipped to CERN for installation. Florida State faculty contributed to several areas of the CMS, especially the electromagnetic calorimeter and the <b>hadron</b> calorimeter.|$|E

5|$|A <b>hadron</b> is a {{composite}} particle made of quarks held together by the strong force. Hadrons are categorized into two families: baryons (such as protons and neutrons) made of three quarks, and mesons (such as pions) made of one quark and one antiquark. Of the hadrons, protons are stable, and neutrons bound within atomic nuclei are stable. Other hadrons are unstable under ordinary conditions and are thus insignificant constituents of the modern Universe.|$|E

25|$|Gluons {{also share}} this {{property}} of being confined within <b>hadrons.</b> One consequence is that gluons {{are not directly}} involved in the nuclear forces between <b>hadrons.</b> The force mediators for these are other <b>hadrons</b> called mesons.|$|R

While the low-lying <b>hadrons</b> are {{strongly}} affected by the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry, in the high-lying <b>hadrons</b> the chiral symmetry is restored. A manifestation of the chiral symmetry restoration in excited <b>hadrons</b> is a persistence of the chiral multiplet structure in both baryon and meson spectra.

5|$|Helium at low {{temperatures}} {{is used in}} cryogenics, and in certain cryogenics applications. As examples of applications, liquid helium is used to cool certain metals to the extremely {{low temperatures}} required for superconductivity, such as in superconducting magnets for magnetic resonance imaging. The Large <b>Hadron</b> Collider at CERN uses 96 metric tons of liquid helium to maintain the temperature at 1.9 kelvin.|$|E
5|$|Investigations of the {{mathematical}} structure of M-theory have spawned important theoretical results in physics and mathematics. More speculatively, M-theory {{may provide a}} framework for developing a unified theory of all of the fundamental forces of nature. Attempts to connect M-theory to experiment typically focus on compactifying its extra dimensions to construct candidate models of our four-dimensional world, although so far none has been verified to give rise to physics as observed at, for instance, the Large <b>Hadron</b> Collider.|$|E

40|$|<b>Hadrons</b> {{interaction}} at high energies {{is carried}} out by one color gluon exchange. All quarks and gluons contained in colliding <b>hadrons</b> take part in interaction and production of particles. The contribution of multiple parton interactions is negligible. Multiple <b>hadrons</b> production at high energies occurs only in three types of processes. The first process is <b>hadrons</b> production in gluon string, the second is <b>hadrons</b> production in two quark strings {{and the third is}} <b>hadrons</b> production in three quark strings. In proton-proton interaction production of only gluon string and two quark strings is possible. In proton-antiproton interaction production of gluon string, two quark strings and three quark strings is possible. Therefore multiplicity distributions in proton-proton and proton-antiproton interactions are different. Comment: Talk given at ISMD 2009 conference, 5 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

50|$|In {{particle}} physics, the Sakata {{model of}} <b>hadrons</b> was {{a precursor to}} the quark model. It proposed that the proton, neutron, and Lambda baryon were elementary particles (sometimes referred to as sakatons), and that all other known <b>hadrons</b> were made of them. The model was proposed by Shoichi Sakata in 1956. The model was successful in explaining many features of <b>hadrons,</b> but was supplanted by the quark model as the understanding of <b>hadrons</b> were better understood.|$|R
25|$|Mesons {{are part}} of the <b>hadron</b> {{particle}} family, and are defined simply as particles composed of two quarks. The other members of the <b>hadron</b> family are the baryons: subatomic particles composed of three quarks.

25|$|A full {{solution}} of QCD should give a full {{description of the}} vacuum, confinement and the <b>hadron</b> spectrum. Lattice QCD is making rapid progress towards providing the solution as a systematically improvable numerical computation. However, approximate models of the QCD vacuum remain useful in more restricted domains.
