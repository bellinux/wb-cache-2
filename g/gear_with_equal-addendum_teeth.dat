40|$|In this paper, {{the forming}} principle, meshing {{features}} and tooth surface equation were introduced. And the modal parameters distribution of cylindrical <b>gears</b> <b>with</b> arcuate tooth trace was researched. The results show: 1. The modulus {{was the biggest}} impact factor for modal and natural frequency of cylindrical <b>gears</b> <b>with</b> arcuate tooth trace, then tooth width, and the radius of tooth line have the minimum influence; 2. When the modulus increased, natural frequency of cylindrical <b>gears</b> <b>with</b> arcuate tooth reduced rapidly; 3. When the tooth width increased, natu-ral frequency of cylindrical <b>gears</b> <b>with</b> arcuate tooth has a ten-dency to rise except for first-order modal; 4. The influence of radius of tooth line can be basic ignored; 5. The second-order modal and third-order modal, fifth-order modal and sixth-order modal was very close. The research on cylindrical <b>gears</b> <b>with</b> arcuate tooth trace in this paper has a certain reference value on gear design and selection...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{paper is}} a part of a study on spur <b>gears</b> <b>with</b> {{asymmetric}} teeth. The presented results refer to the relative slide between the flanks of the asymmetric teeth, one of the criteria used to evaluate the quality of the gear. A method of determining the variation of the relative speed and the specific sliding during a gearing cycle is brought into attention. Using the designed software, the above mentioned aspects are studied on the following: an asymmetric <b>gear</b> <b>with</b> an asymmetry coefficient higher than one, an asymmetric <b>gear</b> <b>with</b> an asymmetry coefficient lower than one, and a symmetric gear, designed for the same distance between the axes and the same number of teeth. Key words: spur <b>gears</b> <b>with</b> asymmetric teeth, tooth with asymmetric involutes profiles, specific sliding 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The tooth {{flanks of}} bevel <b>gears</b> <b>with</b> {{involute}} teeth are still cut using approximations such as Tredgold’s and octoid curves, while {{the geometry of}} the exact spherical involute is well known. The modeling of the tooth flanks of <b>gears</b> <b>with</b> skew axes, however, still represents a challenge to geometers. Hence, {{there is a need}} to develop algorithms for the geometric modeling of these gears. As a matter of fact, the modeling of <b>gears</b> <b>with</b> skew axes and involute teeth is still an open question, as it is not even known whether it makes sense to speak of such tooth geometries. This paper is a contribution along these lines, as pertaining to <b>gears</b> <b>with</b> skew axes and cycloid teeth. To this end, the authors follow and extend results reported by Martin Disteli at the turn of the 20 th century concerning the general synthesis of <b>gears</b> <b>with</b> skew axes. The main goal is to shed light on the geometry of the tooth flanks of <b>gears</b> <b>with</b> skew axes. The dualization of the tooth profiles of spherical cycloidal gears leads to ruled surfaces as conjugate tooth flanks such that at any instant the contact points are located on a straight line. A main result reported herein is Theorem 5, which is original. All results are proven by means of a consistent use of dual vectors representing directed lines and rigid-body twists...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{surface of}} a <b>gear</b> <b>with</b> ring-involute teeth {{generated}} by a rack cutter with ring-involute teeth is {{a new type of}} gear. This paper describes a method developed from gear theory for deriving a pinion and a <b>gear</b> <b>with</b> ring-involute teeth. A <b>gear</b> <b>with</b> ring-involute teeth is regarded as an envelope to the family of rack cutter surfaces when the pinion and gear rotate for a cycle. Using a developed mathematical model, the investigation on the undercutting analysis of the proposed gear is studied. Here the kinematic errors are investigated according to the obtained geometric modelling of the designed gear meshing when assembly errors were present. Stress analysis for the proposed gear was performed. F inally, a numerical example is presented to demonstrate the geometric model of a <b>gear</b> <b>with</b> ring-involute teeth and a gear ratio of 3 : 2...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{analyzing}} spur gear meshing is presented and applied. Analyzing {{the results of}} an example, it is shown that the path of contact and, in particular, the lowest (LPSTC) and the highest (HPSTC) single tooth contact points highly depend on profile modification amount and applied load. Furthermore, the root stress of a <b>gear</b> <b>with</b> profile modification reaches higher values than a <b>gear</b> <b>with</b> an involute profile. This increment is mainly due to an increase of the extension of the actual single tooth pair contact region of a modified <b>gear</b> <b>with</b> respect to the perfect involute gear...|$|R
