5|$|The {{fact that}} most of those who {{recovered}} from first-wave infections were now immune showed that <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> same strain of flu. This was most dramatically illustrated in Copenhagen, which escaped with a combined mortality rate of just 0.29% (0.02% in the first wave and 0.27% in the second wave) because of exposure to the less-lethal first wave.|$|E
500|$|William's {{foresight}} {{about the}} misfortunes {{of his country}} was proven correct {{less than a year}} later. Saladin defeated King Guy at the Battle of Hattin in 1187, and went on to capture Jerusalem and almost every other city of the kingdom, except the seat of William's archdiocese, Tyre. News of the fall of Jerusalem shocked Europe and plans were made to send assistance. According to Roger of Wendover, William was present at Gisors in France in 1188 when Henry II of England and Philip II of France agreed to go on crusade: [...] "Thereupon the king of the English first took {{the sign of the cross}} at the hands of the Archbishop of Rheims and William of Tyre, the latter of whom had been entrusted by our lord the pope with the office of legate in the affairs of the crusade in the western part of Europe." [...] Roger was however mistaken; he knew that an unnamed archbishop of Tyre was present and assumed <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> William whose chronicle he possessed, although the archbishop in question was actually William's successor Joscius.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the London season, Garrick, {{along with}} Peg Woffington, {{travelled}} to Dublin for the summer season at the Theatre Royal, Smock Lane. While in Dublin, Garrick added two new roles to his repertoire: Shakespeare's Hamlet, Abel Drugger in Ben Jonson's The Alchemist (a role that earned him much acclaim) and Captain Plume in Farquhar's The Recruiting Officer. Some of his success could be attributed to one of his earliest fans, John Boyle, 5th Earl of Cork, who wrote letters to many noblemen and gentlemen recommending Garrick's acting. His writings led Garrick to exclaim that <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> reason he was [...] "more caressed" [...] in Dublin.|$|E
2500|$|Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel said in {{the name}} of Rabbi Joshua that from the day that the Temple was destroyed, there was no day without a curse, the dew had not descended for a blessing, and the flavor had {{departed}} from fruits.. Rava said that in addition, the curse of each day was severer than that of the preceding day, as [...] says, [...] "In the morning you shall say: Would God it were evening! And in the evening you shall say: Would God it were morning." [...] The Gemara asked which morning they would long for. If it would be the morning of the next day, nobody knows what that will be like. Therefore, reasoned the Gemara, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> morning of the previous day (because the previous day would have been less severe than the current day, and therefore they longed for its return)..|$|E
