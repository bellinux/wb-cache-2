5|$|As noted below, such a {{cloud of}} {{collectors}} would alter the light <b>emitted</b> <b>by</b> the star system. However, the disruption compared to a star's overall natural emitted spectrum would most likely be too small for Earth-based astronomers to observe.|$|E
5|$|Infrared {{light is}} of lower energy than visible light, hence is <b>emitted</b> <b>by</b> cooler objects. As such, the {{following}} {{can be viewed}} in the infrared: cool stars (including brown dwarves), nebulae, and redshifted galaxies.|$|E

5|$|A {{different}} call is <b>emitted</b> <b>by</b> a male frog or unreceptive female when mounted {{by another}} male. This {{is a distinct}} chirruping sound and {{is accompanied by a}} vibration of the body. Tree frogs and some non-aquatic species have a rain call that they make on the basis of humidity cues prior to a shower. Many species also have a territorial call that is used to drive away other males. All of these calls are emitted with the mouth of the frog closed. A distress call, <b>emitted</b> <b>by</b> some frogs when they are in danger, is produced with the mouth open resulting in a higher-pitched call. It is typically used when the frog has been grabbed by a predator and may serve to distract or disorientate the attacker so that it releases the frog.|$|E
5|$|Exocomets {{beyond the}} Solar System {{have also been}} {{detected}} and may be common in the Milky Way. The first exocomet system detected was around Beta Pictoris, a very young A-type main-sequence star, in 1987. A total of 10 such exocomet systems have been identified , using the absorption spectrum caused by the large clouds of gas <b>emitted</b> <b>by</b> comets when passing close to their star.|$|E
50|$|It is {{possible}} that such quantum primordial black holes were created in the high-density environment of the early Universe (or big bang), or possibly through subsequent phase transitions.

5|$|For natural uranium, about 49% of its {{alpha rays}} are <b>emitted</b> <b>by</b> each of 238U atom, and also 49% by 234U (since {{the latter is}} formed from the former) and about 2.0% of them by the 235U. When the Earth was young, {{probably}} about one-fifth of its uranium was uranium-235, but the percentage of 234U was probably much lower than this.|$|E
5|$|Francium has no {{commercial}} applications, {{but because}} of francium's relatively simple atomic structure, among other things, {{it has been used}} in spectroscopy experiments, leading to more information regarding energy levels and the coupling constants between subatomic particles. Studies on the light <b>emitted</b> <b>by</b> laser-trapped francium-210 ions have provided accurate data on transitions between atomic energy levels, similar to those predicted by quantum theory.|$|E
5|$|Francium's {{ability to}} be synthesized, trapped, and cooled, along with its {{relatively}} simple atomic structure, has made it the subject of specialized spectroscopy experiments. These experiments have led to more specific information regarding energy levels and the coupling constants between subatomic particles.

5|$|In 1959, {{observations}} {{in the microwave}} part of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum (0.1–10GHz) led {{to the discovery of}} the Jovian decimetric radiation (DIM) and the realization that it was synchrotron radiation <b>emitted</b> <b>by</b> relativistic electrons trapped in the planet's radiation belts. These synchrotron emissions were used to estimate the number and energy of the electrons around Jupiter and led to improved estimates of the magnetic moment and its tilt.|$|E

5|$|The alpha {{particles}} <b>emitted</b> <b>by</b> polonium can {{be converted}} to neutrons using beryllium oxide, at a rate of 93 neutrons per million alpha particles. Thus Po-BeO mixtures or alloys are used as a neutron source, for example, in a neutron trigger or initiator for nuclear weapons and for inspections of oil wells.

5|$|Another {{difficulty}} encountered {{during the}} aircraft's introduction was {{the occurrence of}} surging and stalling with the Avon engines. The F.2, which used the Armstrong-Siddeley Sapphire engine, did not suffer from this issue. Further problems occurred; ejected cannon ammunition links {{had a tendency to}} strike and damage the underside of the fuselage, and diverting the gas <b>emitted</b> <b>by</b> the cannon during firing was another necessary modification. The original split-flap airbrakes caused adverse changes in pitch trim and were quickly replaced by a single ventral airbrake. This meant, however, that the airbrake could not be used for landings.|$|E
