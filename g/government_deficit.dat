25|$|The early 1980s saw {{the country}} facing a {{difficult}} period {{of structural adjustment}} caused by declining demand for its traditional products, deteriorating economic performance, and neglected structural reform. Consequently, the 1980–82 recession shook Belgium to the core—unemployment mounted, social welfare costs increased, personal debt soared, the <b>government</b> <b>deficit</b> climbed to 13% of GDP, and the national debt, although mostly held domestically, mushroomed.|$|E

2500|$|The economy did {{poorly in}} 1790–96 as {{industrial}} and agricultural output dropped, foreign trade plunged, and prices soared. The government {{decided not to}} repudiate the old debts. Instead it issued more and more paper money (called [...] "assignat") that supposedly were grounded seized lands. [...] The result was escalating inflation. The government imposed price controls and persecuted speculators and traders in the black market. People increasingly refused to pay taxes as the annual <b>government</b> <b>deficit</b> increased from 10% of gross national product in 1789 to 64% in 1793.

2500|$|The federal {{government}} had two major challenges in creating a truly national energy program. The first problem was that Canada is both an importer and an exporter of oil. It imports oil from offshore sources such as Venezuela and the Middle East into its Eastern provinces, while simultaneously exporting oil from its Western provinces into the United States. While it was popular in Eastern and Central Canada, the program incurred strong resentment {{in the province of}} Alberta [...] where oil and gas production are concentrated. The second problem was that provincial governments, rather than the {{federal government}}, have constitutional jurisdiction over natural resources. The Government of Alberta actually owned most of the oil in Canada. This provoked a confrontation with the government of Alberta, since any reduction in oil prices came directly out of Alberta government revenues. The conflict was made worse {{by the fact that the}} Alberta government had constitutional mechanisms available to it by which it could remove oil from federal taxation and shift the costs of oil subsidies onto the federal government.

2500|$|The Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) is an agreement, {{among the}} 28 Member {{states of the}} European Union, to {{facilitate}} and maintain {{the stability of the}} Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).

If a Member State breaches the SGP's outlined maximum limit for <b>government</b> <b>deficit</b> and debt, the surveillance and request for corrective action will intensify through the declaration of an Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP); and if these corrective actions continue to remain absent after multiple warnings, the Member State can ultimately be issued economic sanctions.
