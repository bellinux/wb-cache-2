We have developed a procedure to study the behavioral and neural processes that mediate the impact of context on alcohol-seeking behavior in rats. Following acclimation to the taste and pharmacological effects of 15 % ethanol in the home cage, male Long-Evans rats receive Pavlovian discrimination training (PDT) in conditioning chambers. In each daily (Mon-Fri) PDT session, 16 trials each of two different 10 sec auditory conditioned stimuli occur. During one stimulus, the CS+, 0. 2 ml of 15 % ethanol is delivered into a <b>fluid</b> <b>port</b> for oral consumption. The second stimulus, the CS-, is not paired with ethanol. Across sessions, entries into the <b>fluid</b> <b>port</b> during the CS+ increase, whereas entries during the CS- stabilize at a lower level, indicating that a predictive association between the CS+ and ethanol is acquired. During PDT each chamber {{is equipped with a}} specific configuration of visual, olfactory and tactile contextual stimuli.

40|$|An {{advanced}} reactant {{pressure regulator}} with an internal ejector reactant circulation pump {{has been developed}} to support NASA's future fuel cell power systems needs. These needs include reliable and safe operation in variable-gravity environments, and for exploration activities with both manned and un manned vehicles. This product was developed for use in Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) power plant reactant circulation systems, but the design could also be applied to other fuel cell system types, (e. g., solid-oxide or alkaline) or for other gas pressure regulation and circulation needs. The regulator design includes porting for measurement of flow and pressure at key points in the system, and also includes several fuel cell system integration options. NASA has recognized ejectors as {{a viable alternative to}} mechanical pumps for use in spacecraft fuel cell power systems. The ejector motive force is provided by a variable, high-pressure supply gas that travels through the ejector s jet nozzle, whereby the pressure energy of the fluid stream is converted to kinetic energy in the gas jet. The ejector can produce circulation-to-consumption-flow ratios that are relatively high (2 - 3 times), and this phenomenon can potentially (with proper consideration of the remainder of the fuel cell system s design) be used to provide completely for reactant pre-humidification and product water removal in a fuel cell system. Specifically, a custom pressure regulator has been developed that includes: (1) an ejector reactant circulation pump (with interchangeable jet nozzles and mixer sections, gas-tight sliding and static seals in required locations, and internal <b>fluid</b> <b>porting</b> for pressure-sensing at the regulator's control elements) and (2) internal <b>fluid</b> <b>porting</b> to allow for flow rate and system pressure measurements.

40|$|A micromachined open {{tubular reactor}} is presented, which was {{developed}} with special {{focus on the}} application in heterogeneous immunoassays such as the Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). In contrary to previous designs, this device was realized in silicon as a single channel and with one-side fluid connections. For the micromechanical fabrication a two side process employing SiC as an etch mask was developed. As a result, microreactors were produced with an internal volume of 27 mu l, which exhibit a meander-shaped channel at the chip frontside and two <b>fluid</b> <b>ports</b> on the backside. The meander is sealed with a pyrex cover by anodic bonding. During fabrication a silicon oxide layer with a high density of silanol groups is deposited at the inner reactor walls, resulting in a ready-to-use device for the covalent immobilization of immunoreceptors without the need of additional surface treatment. Due to the fact, that both <b>fluid</b> <b>ports</b> are located on the chip backside, the integr ation into a flow-through system is feasible with a simple snap-in mount.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. November 2014. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisor: Perry Y. Li. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xii, 337 pages, appendices A-D. The high power density of fluid-powered actuators can facilitate design of compact and powerful devices. Pneumatic actuators {{in particular are}} preferred in human interactive devices due to their properties such as inherent compliance, backdrivability and benign consequences of leakage. A drawback of pneumatic actuators is that the current sources of compressed air are bulky and not suitable for mobile human-centered applications. To address these concerns, research is underway on advanced gas based actuation devices such as chemo-fluidic actuators, dry ice actuators, and mini-HCCI engines. These actuators are ideal for development of powerful and mobile devices for human scale applications. The operation of these devices typically requires direct human interaction between the pneumatic (or gas) actuated system and the human operator. Therefore safety of operation is imperative. One way of investigating interaction stability (and hence safe operation) between multiple systems is by using the framework of Passivity analysis from systems theory. The objective of the research presented in this dissertation is investigation of passivity characteristics of pneumatic actuators. This passivity analysis is a preliminary step in understanding the feasibility of using gas based actuators in human interactive applications. Passivity analysis requires definition of a storage function to quantify the effect of inputs and outputs on the system dynamics. The nonlinear dynamics of air compression and expansion in a pneumatic actuator {{are affected by the}} heat transfer across the walls of the actuator. In this thesis, physics based energy functions are developed and defined to be the storage function for three specific models of heat transfer viz adiabatic, isothermal, and finite heat transfer. For reversible thermodynamic process (adiabatic or isothermal), the storage function is defined as the work that can be extracted from the actuator. The storage function for actuator with finite heat transfer is defined as the maximum work that can be extracted from the pneumatic actuator. It is shown that the solution to this optimization problem provides a storage function similar to exergy of the air in the actuator. The supply rate based on these storage functions corresponds to physically meaningful power interaction between different subsystems, such as the actuator and the inertia load. Both adiabatic and isothermal actuators have two ports for power interaction : mechanical port corresponding to interaction with an inertial load, and <b>fluid</b> <b>port</b> corresponding to interaction with source/sink of compressed air. The adiabatic/isothermal actuator behaves as a two-port nonlinear spring with an active flow input at the <b>fluid</b> <b>port</b> of the actuator. Pneumatic actuator with finite heat transfer to the ambient has an additional port corresponding to the thermal interaction with the ambient. The supply rate to the pneumatic actuator with finite heat transfer illustrates that irrespective of chamber air temperature, heat transfer reduces the ability of the actuator to do work, thus contributing to passive behavior of the actuator. Energetically passive controller design for pneumatic actuated human power amplifier and tele-operated human scale devices is presented in this thesis. A framework for controlling the active flow variable at the <b>fluid</b> <b>port</b> of the pneumatic actuator to provide passive operation of a pneumatically actuated human power amplifier is presented by assuming the heat transfer model in the actuator to be either adiabatic or isothermal. This framework is then extended to define the framework for achieving co-ordinated tele-operation of multiple pneumatic actuated devices, while again amplifying input human power. The control problem is suitably defined within the proposed framework and a two-stage back-stepping controller is used to achieve the control objective. The Lyapunov function for the actuator controller design is defined based on the energy functions developed for adiabatic and isothermal actuators. The designed controllers are implemented on single-DOF systems and a multi-DOF robotic rescue crawler with pneumatic actuators. Experimental results confirming the efficacy of the proposed controller are provided. Finally, independent metering of each actuator chamber to improve the operational efficiency of the pneumatic actuators is investigated. In independent metering, two servo valves are used to control the air flow rate to the two chambers of the actuator. The valves are controlled to maintain a low operating pressure in both the chambers, while providing the desired actuator force. This mitigates the losses associated with discharge of high pressure air to atmosphere. Effectiveness of independent metering is evaluated in a single-DOF human power amplifier by assuming the heat transfer model in the actuator to be isothermal. Experimental results show 70...|$|E
40|$|Environmental stimuli {{that are}} {{reliably}} paired with alcohol may acquire incentive salience, a property that can {{operate in the}} use and abuse of alcohol. Here we investigated the incentive salience of Pavlovian alcohol cues using a preclinical animal model. Male, Long-Evans rats (Harlan) with unrestricted access to food and water were acclimated to drinking 15 % ethanol (v/v) in their home-cages. Rats then received Pavlovian autoshaping training in which the 10 second presentation of a retractable lever served as the conditioned stimulus (CS) and 15 % ethanol served as the unconditioned stimulus (US) (0. 2 ml/CS; 12 CS presentations/session; 27 sessions). Next, in an operant test of conditioned reinforcement, nose pokes into an active aperture delivered presentations of the lever-CS, whereas nose pokes into an inactive aperture had no consequences. Across initial autoshaping sessions, goal-tracking behavior, as measured by entries into the <b>fluid</b> <b>port</b> where ethanol was delivered, developed rapidly. However, with extended training goal-tracking diminished, and sign-tracking responses, as measured by lever-CS activations, emerged. Control rats that received explicitly unpaired CS and US presentations did not show goal-tracking or sign-tracking responses. In the test for conditioned reinforcement, rats with CS-US pairings during autoshaping training made more active relative to inactive nose pokes, whereas rats in the unpaired control group did not. Moreover, active nose pokes were positively correlated with sign-tracking behavior during autoshaping. Extended training may produce {{a shift in the}} learned properties of Pavlovian alcohol cues, such that after initially predicting alcohol availability they acquire robust incentive salience...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Drug craving can be {{independently}} {{stimulated by}} cues that are directly associated with drug intake (discrete drug cues), {{as well as}} by environmental contexts in which drug use occurs (contextual drug cues). We tested the hypothesis that the context in which a discrete alcohol-predictive cue is experienced can influence how robustly that cue stimulates alcohol-seeking behavior. Methods: Male, Long-Evans rats received Pavlovian discrimination training (PDT) sessions in which one conditioned stimulus (CS+; 16 trials/session) was paired with ethanol (0. 2 mL/CS+) and a second stimulus (CS-; 16 trials/ session) was not. PDT occurred in a specific context, and entries into a <b>fluid</b> <b>port</b> where ethanol was delivered were measured during each CS. Next, rats were acclimated to an alternate (nonalcohol) context where cues and ethanol were withheld. Responses to the nonextinguished CS+ and CS- were then tested without ethanol in the alcohol-associated PDT context, the nonalcohol context or a third, novel context. Results: Across PDT the CS+ elicited more port entries than the CS-, indicative of Pavlovian discrimination learning. At test, the CS+ elicited more port entries than the CS- in all three contexts: however, alcohol seeking driven by the CS+ was more robust in the alcohol- associated context. In a separate experiment, extinguishing the context- alcohol association did not influence subsequent CS+ responding but reduced alcohol seeking during non-CS+ intervals during a spontaneous recovery test. Conclusion: These results indicate that alcohol-seeking behavior driven by a discrete Pavlovian alcohol cue is strongly invigorated by an alcohol context, and suggest that contexts may function as excitatory Pavlovian conditioned stimuli that directly trigger alcohol-seeking behavior...|$|E

The instrumented boreholes resulting from scientific ocean drilling offer access to samples of the formation fluids circulating through oceanic crust. We analyzed the phylogenetic diversity of bacterial communities of fluid and microbial mat samples collected in situ from the observatory at Ocean Drilling Program Hole 896 A, drilled into ~ 6. 5 million-year-old basaltic crust on the flank of the Costa Rica Rift in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. Bacterial 16 S rRNA gene sequences recovered from borehole fluid and from a microbial mat coating the outer surface of the <b>fluid</b> <b>port</b> revealed both unique and shared phylotypes. The dominant bacterial clones from both samples {{were related to the}} autotrophic, sulfur-oxidizing genus Thiomicrospira. Both samples yielded diverse gamma- and alphaproteobacterial phylotypes, as well as members of the Bacteroidetes, Planctomycetes, and Verrucomicrobia. Analysis of ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) genes (cbbL and cbbM) from the sampling port mat and from the borehole fluid demonstrated autotrophic carbon assimilation potential for in situ microbial communities; most cbbL genes were related to those of the sulfur-oxidizing genera Thioalkalivibrio and Thiomicrospira, and cbbM genes were affiliated with uncultured phylotypes from hydrothermal vent plumes and marine sediments. Several 16 S rRNA gene phylotypes from the 896 A observatory grouped with phylotypes recovered from seawater-exposed basalts and sulfide deposits at inactive hydrothermal vents, but there is little overlap with hydrothermally influenced basaltic boreholes 1026 B and U 1301 A on the Juan de Fuca Ridge flank, suggesting that site-specific characteristics of Hole 896 A (i. e., seawater mixing into borehole fluids) affect the microbial community composition...|$|E

Based {{on the structure of}} the EHD {{injection pump}}, an improved design with grid distances in the range between 10 mym and 60 mym were achieved, yielding a reduction in the required driving voltage. Grid areas of 2. 5 x 2. 5 qmm and 1 x 1 qmm were accomplished. The outer dimensions of the smallest pumps are 3 x 3 x 1. 0 cbmm. One of the grids is etched back from the frontside and mounted upside down on the lower grid {{in order to reduce the}} grid distance. The two grids are bonded together by anodic bonding. The pump is mounted in a ceramic housing with two <b>fluid</b> <b>ports.</b> Experimental data relating to the electrical and hydrodynamic behaviour of the optimized micropump are presented. Based on the same structure a novel method for the measurement of fluid flow and velocity was developed. This technique is especial ly suited for small flow rates below 100 ml/min down to some myl/min, which is difficult to measure by known methods. The presented method is based on the measurement of the ion transit time between the two grids. Upon application of a step voltage between the two grids a cusp is observed in the associated transient space charge limited current (TSCLC). The cusp signifies the arrival of the first charge carriers at the opposite electrode, and hence the ion transit time. The transit time will now increase or decrease depending on the flow rate and direction and is therefore a direct measure of the fluid flow rate. This behavior was infered from one-dimensional calculations and subsequently confirmed by appropriate experiments. The method is not restricted to electrically isolating fluids. Volumetric flow rates down to 8 myl/min were measured with a 2. 5 x 2. 5 qmm grid area.

Important river features for flora and fauna have disappeared and the ecological quality of the river reduced dramatically. Recently, the importance of the ecological function of rivers has been getting more attention. One river restoration measure is the removal of man-made bank protections to increase habitat diversity and biodiversity of riparian areas and the river basin. The river morphology may change due to the freely eroding banks in the restored section. Reference projects show that the removal of bank protection along rivers may lead to the formation of bars (e. g. Schirmer et al., 2014). Bars increase morphological diversity, providing specific habitats for flora and fauna (Kurth and Schirmer, 2014). There is a lack of knowledge about the formation of bars related to the length and location of the removal of bank protection. The length of river bank protection removal is usually limited, due to human activities along the riversides. Therefore, a guideline is needed for the design of bank protection removal to enhance habitat diversity through bar formation to make this a feasible river restoration method.

We report on a patient where {{a large amount of}} synovial fluid mimicked rupture of an implant. We believe this to be an unusual clinical presentation of this phenomenon. Review of the English language literature failed to identify a comparable case. Case presentation A 25 -year-old woman had undergone bilateral breast augmentation for cosmetic reasons. One implant was subsequently subjected to two attempts at expansion to correct asymmetry. The patient was later found to have a large quantity of viscous <b>fluid</b> around the <b>port</b> of that same prosthesis. Histological assessment of the implant had consequently confirmed capsular synovial metaplasia. This had initially caused the suspicion of a silicone 'bleed' from the implant and had resulted in an unnecessary explantation. Conclusion Capsular synovial metaplasia should be ruled out before the removal of breast implants where a leak is suspected. Manipulation and expansion of an implant may be risk factors for the development of synovial metaplasia. </p...|$|R
40|$|In this {{publication}} {{a summary of}} the research on micropumps and microfluid components for mu mTAS applications is given, which has been conducted in the framework of the research projects VIMAS and MIBIK, supported by the German Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Technology (BMBF). In the framework of VIMAS a mu mTAS for water quality control is developed, which uses four micropumps for the supply of sample, calibrant and carrier solution. For this purpose an electrostatically actuated micropump was developed. This device basically consists of four silicon chips with outer dimensions of 7 x 7 mm 2, which are mounted as a stack and form an electrostatic actuation unit and a flap valve unit. Pumping operation is achieved by applying a square wave signal to the electrostatic actuator, which causes an alternate electrostatic attraction and mechanical relaxation of the flexible pump membrane. With a stroke volume of about 30 nl, the actual design delivers a pump rate up to 1 ml/min and a maximum counter pressure of 300 mbar, which is by far sufficient for the operation in a mu mTAS. For fluidic interconnection of the mu mTAS a silicon backplane with total outer dimensions of 30 x 30 mm 2 was realized, which comprises anisotropically etched fluid channels on the back side and <b>fluid</b> connection <b>ports</b> on the front side. The fluid channels are closed with an anodically bonded pyrex cover. In the framework of MIBIK two hybrid Flow Injection Analysis (FIA) systems are being developed, which integrate silicon microfluid components with conventional macroscopic fluid devices such as roller pumps. For these analyzers, the following microfluid components have been realized: A micro-miniaturized channel-type immunoreactor; a micro-miniaturized membrane-type immunoreactor; a hybrid-integrated micro-thermostat, and a micro flow-through cell for amperometric biosensors...|$|R
40|$|A fluid {{storage and}} {{expulsion}} system comprising a tank with an internal flexible diaphragm assembly of dual diaphragms in back-to-back relationship, {{at least one}} of which is provided with a patterned surface having fine edges such that the diaphragms are in contact along said edges without mating contact of surface areas to thereby form fluid channels which extend outwardly to the peripheral edges of the diaphragms is described. The interior wall of the tank at the juncture of tank sections is formed with a circumferential annular recess comprising an outer annular recess portion which forms a fluid collection chamber and an inner annular recess portion which accommodates the peripheral edge portions of the diaphragms and a sealing ring in clamped sealing relation therebetween. The sealing ring is perforated with radially extending passages which allow any fluid leaking or diffusing past a diaphragm to flow through the fluid channels between the diaphragms to the <b>fluid</b> collection chamber. <b>Ports</b> connectable to pressure fittings are provided in the tank sections for admission of fluids to opposite sides of the diaphragm assembly. A drain passage through the tank wall to the fluid collection chamber permits detection, analysis and removal of fluids in the collection chamber...|$|R
40|$|The rotordynamic {{behavior}} of turbomachinery is critically dependent on fluid dynamic rotor forces developed by {{various types of}} seals and bearings. The occurrence of self-excited vibrations often depends on the rotor speed and load. Misalignment and rotor wobbling motion associated with differential clearance were often attributed to stability problems. In general, the rotative character of the flowfield is a complex three dimensional system with secondary flow patterns that significantly alter the average fluid circumferential velocity. A multidimensional, nonorthogonal, body-fitted-grid fluid flow model is presented that describes the fluid dynamic forces and the secondary flow pattern development in seals and bearings. Several numerical experiments were carried out to demonstrate the characteristics of this complex flowfield. Analyses were performed by solving a conservation form of the three dimensional Navier-Stokes equations transformed to those for a rotating observer and using the general-purpose computer code PHOENICS with the assumptions that the rotor orbit is circular and that static eccentricity is zero. These assumptions have enabled a precise steady-state analysis to be used. <b>Fluid</b> injection from <b>ports</b> near the seal or bearing center increased fluid-film direct dynamic stiffness and, in some cases, significantly increased quadrature dynamic stiffness. Injection angle and velocity {{could be used for}} active rotordynamic control; for example, injection, when compared with no injection, increased direct dynamic stiffness, which is an important factor for hydrostatic bearings...|$|R
