If <b>emulations</b> run much faster than humans, {{there might not be}} enough time for human leaders to make wise decisions or negotiate. It's possible that humans would react violently against growing power of <b>emulations,</b> especially if they depress human wages.

40|$|<b>Emulations,</b> {{defined as}} ongoing {{internal}} representations of potential actions and the futures those actions {{are expected to}} produce, {{play a critical role}} in directing human bodily activities. Studies of gross motor behavior, perception, allocation of attention, response to errors, interoception and homeostatic activities, and higher cognitive reasoning suggest that the proper execution of all these functions relies on <b>emulations.</b> Further evidence supports the notion that reinforcement learning in humans is aimed at updating <b>emulations,</b> and that action selection occurs via the advancement of preferred <b>emulations</b> toward realization of their action and environmental prediction. <b>Emulations</b> are hypothesized to exist as distributed active networks of neurons in cortical and sub-cortical structures.

In 2009, a {{spokesperson}} for the game-downloading service GameTap stated that GameTap had non-exclusive rights to distribute the game, but as Saturn <b>emulation</b> is difficult, there was not enough demand to make it a priority. In the same year, Futatsugi stated that Sega had lost the game's source code, which would make porting the game difficult.|$|E

40|$|Abstract We present work-preserving <b>emulations</b> {{with small}} {{slowdown}} between LogP {{and two other}} parallelmodels: BSP and QSM. In conjunction with earlier work-preserving <b>emulations</b> between QSM and BSP these results establish a close correspondence between these three general-purpose parallel models. Ourresults also correct and improve on results reported earlier on <b>emulations</b> between BSP and LogP. In particular we shed {{new light on the}} relative power of stalling and nonstalling LogP models. The QSM is a shared-memory model with only two parameters-p, the number of processors, and g, a bandwidth parameter. These features of the QSM make it a convenient model for parallel algorithmdesign, and the simple work-preserving <b>emulations</b> of QSM on BSP and LogP show that algorithms designed on the QSM will map well on to these other models. This presents a strong case for the use ofQSM as the model of choice for parallel algorithm design...|$|R
40|$|Many {{scientists}} {{expect the}} eventual development of intelligent software programs capable of closely emulating human brains, {{to the point}} of substituting for human labor in almost every economic niche. As software, such <b>emulations</b> could be cheaply copied, with copies subsequently diverging and interacting with their copy-relatives. This paper examines a set of evolutionary pressures on interaction between related <b>emulations,</b> pressures favoring the emergence of superorganisms, groups of <b>emulations</b> ready to selfsacrifice in service of the superorganism. We argue that the increased capacities and internal coordination of such superorganisms could pose increased risks of overriding human values, but also could facilitate the solution of global coordination problems...|$|R

5|$|Early {{models of}} the Wii are fully {{backwards}} compatible with GameCube software {{and most of its}} accessories; the Wii Family Edition and the Wii Mini iterations lack GameCube support. Early versions of the PlayStation 3 and all {{models of the}} Xbox 360 only offer partial support and use software <b>emulation</b> for backwards compatibility. Current versions of the PS3 do not offer PlayStation 2 compatibility, though PS1 compatibility is retained. Some models of the first generation of the PS3 offered full backwards compatibility for PS2 games. The Xbox 360's compatibility is increased through game-specific patches automatically downloaded from Xbox Live or downloaded and burned to a CD or DVD from the Xbox website and the PS3's compatibility is expanded with firmware updates.|$|E

40|$|An {{approach}} to calculating model physics using neural network <b>emulations,</b> previously proposed and {{developed by the}} authors, has been implemented in this study for both longwave and shortwave radiation parameterizations, or to the full model radiation, the most time-consuming component of model physics. The developed highly accurate neural network <b>emulations</b> of the NCAR Community Atmospheric Model (CAM) longwave and shortwave radiation parameterizations are 150 and 20 {{times as fast as}} the original/ control longwave and shortwave radiation parameterizations, respectively. The full neural network model radiation was used for a decadal climate model simulation with the NCAR CAM. A detailed comparison of parallel decadal climate simulations performed with the original NCAR model radiation parameteriza-tions and with their neural network <b>emulations</b> is presented. Almost identical results have been obtained for the parallel decadal simulations.

5|$|Estate {{houses in}} Scotland or Scottish country houses, are large houses usually on landed estates in Scotland. They were built from the sixteenth century, after {{defensive}} castles {{began to be}} replaced by more comfortable residences for royalty, nobility and local lairds.
