The lava flows in total are about [...] long and still contain their original features from when they cooled, including pressure ridges and lava channels. A series of large trees were engulfed by the lava flows during eruption. The bases of the trees burned and the upper trunks and branches collapsed into the solidifying lava, leaving the trees embedded {{on the surface of the}} lava flows. After the flows solidified, tree molds and lava tubes collapsed to form volcanic pits.
