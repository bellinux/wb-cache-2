5|$|The {{national}} park center opened in 2001 {{and the park}} was expanded on 23 August 2003. At {{the same time the}} adjacent Øvre Pasvik Landscape Protection Area was created, which borders Pasvik Nature Reserve. Thus the five protected areas were connected. Since 2011 a local political board <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the management of the park.|$|E
5|$|Amanita ocreata {{is highly}} toxic, and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> {{mushroom}} poisonings in western North America, {{particularly in the}} spring. It contains highly toxic amatoxins, as well as phallotoxins, a feature shared with the closely related death cap (A. phalloides), half a cap {{of which can be}} enough to kill a human, and other species known as destroying angels. There is some evidence it may be the most toxic of all the North American phalloideae, as a higher proportion of people consuming it had organ damage and 40% perished. Dogs have also been known to consume this fungus in California with fatal results.|$|E
50|$|The Christchurch fault <b>is</b> {{believed}} to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> {{a series of}} earthquakes that rocked the city on Boxing Day of 2010. It may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> a moderate earthquake that shook the city in 1869.|$|R
50|$|Established in 1940, Bureau of Ships (BuShips) succeeded the Bureau of Construction and Repair, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> ship {{design and}} construction, and the Bureau of Engineering, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> {{propulsion}} systems. These bureaus traced their origins back to earlier organizations.|$|R
25|$|The {{movement}} {{is divided into}} three factions. In 2011, Boko Haram <b>was</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> at least 450 killings in Nigeria. It was also reported that they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> over 620 deaths over the first 6 months of 2012. Since its founding in 2001, the jihadists <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> between 3,000 and 10,000 deaths.|$|R
5|$|John James Audubon {{reported}} that the American white ibis was hunted and sold in Louisiana, and mainly eaten by American Indians. It had orange flesh and a strong fishy taste. Elsewhere, the flesh {{has been described as}} appealing on account of the crayfish diet, and both members of the genus Eudocimus have been hunted, which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> decline, across their range. Crawfish farmers in Louisiana have also shot them for foraging in crawfish ponds. Overall, the impact of hunting is not thought to be major.|$|E
5|$|Mauna Loa has {{probably}} been erupting for at least 700,000years, and may have emerged above sea level about 400,000years ago. The oldest-known dated rocks are not older than 200,000years. The volcano's magma comes from the Hawaii hotspot, which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> {{the creation of the}} Hawaiian island chain over tens of millions of years. The slow drift of the Pacific Plate will eventually carry Mauna Loa away from the hotspot within 500,000 to one million years from now, at which point it will become extinct.|$|E
5|$|The Red Bull Air Race was {{conceived}} in 2001 in the Red Bull sports think-tank which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> creating {{a range of}} new sports events across the world. The aim {{was to develop a}} new aviation race that would challenge the ability of the world's best pilots, creating a race in the sky that was not simply about speed, but also precision and skill. The answer was to build a specially designed obstacle course which the pilots would navigate at high speeds.|$|E

5|$|The {{barrels of}} the cannon in {{question}} are stationed outside the Officers' Mess at the Royal Artillery Barracks at Woolwich. The remaining {{portion of the}} only remaining cascabel, weighing 10kilograms (385oz), is stored in a vault maintained by 15 Regiment Royal Logistic Corps at MoD Donnington. It can only be removed under armed guard. It is estimated that approximately 80 to 85 more VCs could be cast from this source. A single company of jewellers, Hancocks of London, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the production of every VC.|$|E
5|$|The pelagic {{stingray}} is not aggressive and rarely encountered {{because of its}} habitat preferences, but its very long tail spine demands extreme caution be exercised in handling it. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> two known fatalities: a worker on a tuna longliner who was impaled by a captured ray, and another fishery worker who succumbed to tetanus days after being stung. This species has been kept in public aquariums for almost a century.|$|E
5|$|The round ribbontail ray is not aggressive, and {{has been}} known to {{approach}} and investigate divers. However, if harassed it can inflict a severe wound with its venomous tail spine. This species <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> at least one recorded fatality, of a diver who was stabbed while attempting to ride the ray. The round ribbontail ray is popular with ecotourist divers because of its size and spectacular appearance. Although displayed in public aquariums, it is not hardy and 81 days is the longest one has been kept in captivity.|$|E

5|$|When young, it may {{be mistaken}} for the edible St George's {{mushroom}} (Calocybe gambosa) or the miller (Clitopilus prunulus). It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> many cases of mushroom poisoning in Europe. E.sinuatum causes primarily gastrointestinal problems that, though not generally life-threatening, {{have been described as}} highly unpleasant. Delirium and depression are uncommon sequelae. It is generally not considered to be lethal, although one source has reported deaths from the consumption of this mushroom.|$|E
5|$|Fungi have a {{worldwide}} distribution, and grow {{in a wide}} range of habitats, including extreme environments such as deserts or areas with high salt concentrations or ionizing radiation, as well as in deep sea sediments. Some can survive the intense UV and cosmic radiation encountered during space travel. Most grow in terrestrial environments, though several species live partly or solely in aquatic habitats, such as the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, a parasite that <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> {{a worldwide}} decline in amphibian populations. This organism spends part of its life cycle as a motile zoospore, enabling it to propel itself through water and enter its amphibian host. Other examples of aquatic fungi include those living in hydrothermal areas of the ocean.|$|E
5|$|Generally nocturnal, {{the round}} ribbontail ray can be solitary or gregarious, {{and is an}} active {{predator}} of small, benthic molluscs, crustaceans, and bony fishes. It is aplacental viviparous, with the embryos sustained by yolk, and later histotroph ("uterine milk") secreted by the mother; up to seven pups are born at a time. Although not aggressive, if provoked the round ribbontail ray will defend itself with its venomous tail spine, and it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> at least one fatality. It is valued by ecotourist divers and recreational anglers. This slow-reproducing species is threatened by commercial fishing, both targeted and as bycatch, and habitat degradation across much of its range. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Vulnerable.|$|E

5|$|The Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial {{site was}} officially opened, and the {{memorial}} unveiled, by Field Marshal Earl Haig on 7 June 1925. Since Newfoundland's confederation with Canada in 1949, the Canadian Government, through the Department of Veterans Affairs, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the site's maintenance and care. The site {{had fallen into}} some disrepair during the German occupation of France in the Second World War and following confederation {{the replacement of the}} original site cabin with a modern building as well as some trench restoration work was undertaken in time for the 45th anniversary of the battle. The memorial site was established as one of only two National Historic Sites of Canada located outside of Canada by the then Minister of Canadian Heritage Sheila Copps on 10 April 1997.|$|E
5|$|The {{barrels of}} the cannon used {{to cast the}} medals are {{stationed}} outside the Officers' Mess, at the Royal Artillery Barracks at Woolwich. The remaining portion of the only remaining cascabel, weighing 10kilograms (358oz), is stored in a vault maintained by 15 Regiment, Royal Logistic Corps at MoD Donnington, and can be removed only under armed guard. It is estimated that 80 to 85 more Victoria Crosses could be cast from this source. A single company of jewellers, Hancocks of London, established in 1849, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the production of every medal since its inception. Both the Australian and New Zealand Victoria Crosses are made from the same gunmetal as the originals.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} of farm animals seldom occurs spontaneously but is managed by farmers {{with a view}} to encouraging certain traits that are seen as desirable. These include hardiness, prolificness, mothering abilities, fast growth rates, low feed consumption per unit of growth, better body proportions, higher yields, better fibre qualities and other characteristics. Undesirable traits such as health defects, aggressiveness or lack of docility are selected against. Selective breeding <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> some large increases in productivity. In 2007, a typical broiler chicken at eight weeks old was 4.8 times as heavy as a bird of similar age in 1957. In the thirty years to 2007, the average milk yield of a dairy cow in the United States nearly doubled.|$|E
50|$|From 1901 to 1921, Robert Stuart <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> {{managing}} the Quaker Oats Company's facilities, and Crowell <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> marketing. Douglas Stuart's older brother, John Stuart, was groomed {{to take over}} Robert Stuart's responsibilities, while Douglas Stuart trained under Crowell. In 1922, the elder Stuart and Crowell retired, and John and Douglas Stuart took over the day-to-day operations of the company.|$|R

5|$|At Lebec, California, {{just south}} of the {{epicenter}} of the July mainshock, the San Andreas Fault comes together with the Garlock Fault, which is positioned at the northern border of the Mojave Desert. The San Andreas <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> considerable seismic activity at its northern and southern sections, and traverses the area near the Transverse Ranges. The Kern Canyon Fault mirrors the path of the Kern River, and was thought to have a connection with the White Wolf Fault, but indicators observed following the July 21 earthquake demonstrated that the two are offset. The Owens Valley Fault, {{on the east side of}} the Sierran block, has been mapped and may possibly extend into area that was affected by the 1952 shocks. Other fault zones are present in the region, and have been of interest because they may have been responsible for minor earthquakes, but they are considered not as significant as the Kern Canyon, Owens Valley, and San Andreas Faults.|$|E
