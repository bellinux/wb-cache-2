Early {{on with his}} career with Disturbed, Donegan played Gibson Les Paul Standards and SGs. Then, he {{switched}} to play a few Paul Reed Smith models, the Tremonti Model and a PRS Singlecut. In 2005, Washburn Guitars built Donegan his own signature model called the Maya, named after his daughter. For 2010, Dan built a signature guitar with Schecter guitars, {{that is based on}} the ultra classic model (his being the ultra DD). Donegan is a fan of GHS Boomer guitar strings and uses the 12-52 <b>gauge</b> <b>set.</b> He also uses Seymour Duncan pickups in his guitars. He is currently signed to Schecter Guitars.|$|E
5000|$|With the guitar-based rock {{revival of}} the 1960s, Ball noticed that {{beginning}} students were having difficulty playing the bestselling Fender #100 medium gauge strings, particularly in holding down or bending the stiff 29-gauge third ("G") string. At the time, it was common {{for a set of}} strings to have a [...] "wound" [...] third string. He approached the Fender company with the problem, suggesting a lighter gauge but was rebuffed. Ball convinced a string manufacturer to make him custom sets with a 24-gauge third string which he sold in his store. It {{was the beginning of the}} Ernie Ball brand. Located not far from Hollywood, the store began to attract a large patronage of professional musicians, including The Beach Boys, Merle Travis, and The Ventures. Ball also began to notice the practice of [...] "slack stringing" [...] among players who discarded the bottom sixth string and added a banjo first string on top. This resulted in an overall lighter <b>gauge</b> <b>set</b> with a plain third string. Again, he contacted Fender with a suggestion for a lighter set and was turned down. He then approached Gibson, who also turned him down. So, once again he ordered from the manufacturer naming the product the Ernie Ball Slinky. [...] "Slinky" [...] strings traveled the country with the pro musicians who used them and before long, Ball was receiving mail orders from individuals and stores. Still not a string company, he ordered separate strings in various sizes and displayed them in a makeshift case allowing musicians to experiment in creating their own sets. It took off, and in 1967 he sold the store and moved his string business to Newport Beach, California.|$|E
50|$|The {{rear drum}} brakes from the S (and other Corolla trims) were {{replaced}} with the drum in disc brakes from the Celica GT-S and the ABS system was upgraded to a four-channel with EBD (Electronic Brakeforce Distribution). Absent are Traction Control and Stability Control Systems (VSC). The Corolla XRS was given 5 spoke 16-inch painted aluminum alloy wheels (similar to the Matrix) and shod with Michelin Pilot Primacy P195/55-R16 summer performance tires and equipped with a Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS). The wheels are the most noticeable difference in exterior appearance from the Corolla S that features 6-spoke 15-inch alloy wheels. Other exterior differences being the key colored grill surround (other trims have chrome), XRS badge at the back, rear discs, and the slightly lowered appearance.The interior features a three-spoke leather wrapped steering wheel, leather shift knob, and leather shift boot from the Matrix XRS. Optitron gauges like those found in Lexus vehicles replaced the standard <b>gauge</b> <b>set</b> with white numbers and red markings and needles for a sporty appearance. The interior has dark blue plastic with silver accenting and beige pillars {{from the bottom of}} the windows to the beige headliner. The dashboard is black. The front seats were replaced with manually adjustable sports seats with more side bolster. The 4 main seats are black cloth with a blue hexagon pattern and black cloth sides. Interestingly, the front floor mats are from the Corolla S. Due to the rear X-Brace, the rear seats do not fold 60-40 like those found in the other Corolla trims. Color choices for the Corolla XRS were: Super White II, Silver Streak Mica, Phantom Gray Pearl, Black Sand Pearl, Impulse Red Pearl, and Indigo Ink Pearl.|$|E

40|$|Collaborative {{filtering}} (CF) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular recommender system technologies, and utilizes the known preferences of a group of users to predict the unknown preference of a new user. However, the existing CF techniques has the drawback that it requires the entire existing data be maintained and analyzed repeatedly whenever new user ratings are added. To avoid such a problem, Eigentaste, a CF approach based on the principal component analysis (PCA), has been proposed. However, Eigentaste requires that each user rate every item in the so called <b>gauge</b> <b>set</b> for executing PCA, which may not be always feasible in practice. Developed in this article is an iterative PCA approach in which no <b>gauge</b> <b>set</b> is required, and singular value decomposition is employed for estimating missing ratings and dimensionality reduction. Principal component values for users in reduced dimension are used for clustering users. Then, the proposed approach is compared to Eigentaste in terms of the mean absolute error of prediction using the Jester, MovieLens, and EachMovie data sets. Experimental results show that the proposed approach, even without a <b>gauge</b> <b>set,</b> performs slightly better than Eigentaste regardless of the data set and clustering method employed, implying that it can be used as a useful alternative when defining a <b>gauge</b> <b>set</b> is neither possible nor practical...|$|E

Pots without bait were set on the bottom with intervals of about 1 m at depths about 1. 5 - 2. 5 m. Each pot was hauled up 23 h after {{the beginning of the}} experiment (10 a. m. until 9 a. m. the next day) and the number of prawns in each was counted.

50|$|Best safety {{requires}} that the chain is properly sharpened. One key sharpening parameter is the depth <b>gauge</b> <b>setting.</b> The depth <b>gauge</b> is the small steel protuberance {{in front of each}} cutting tooth. The difference in height between the leading cutting edge and the depth gauge determines the thickness of the wood chip taken by the cutter. If the depth gauge is too low, the cutter takes too deep a bite from the wood, the saw becomes difficult to control and the chances of kickback increase.|$|R

40|$|Paper number 6 GL 03583. To {{understand}} {{climate change}} and to predict changes in climate, both atmospheric and ocean models {{need to be able}} to reproduce the responses of the system they are estimating. An evaluation of two related global ocean models, using a nine year time series of model sea surfaceh eights and measurementso f sea level from a global tide <b>gauge</b> <b>set,</b> shows that the ocean models satisfactorily reproduce the instantaneous local change in sea level. Sea level can be used as a tool to understand a model's ability to simulate sea surface temperature and thus influence atmospheric flows. The implication for climate modeling is that these ocean models can be used to simulate seasonal to decadal variations in global ocean circulation when coupled to high quality atmospheric models.
