40|$|Multiple duct anastomoses during LLS {{transplantation}} {{increase the}} incidence of biliary complications. The optimal plane of <b>hepatotomy</b> that results in the least number of bile ducts at the surface was investigated according to LHD variations. Ducts of 30 human livers were injected with resin and LHD branching on 3 D-CT reconstructions were analyzed. Ducts on the virtual <b>hepatotomy</b> surface were estimated in three splitting lines. Variations with subtypes were described. Ia (66. 7 %) : ducts from segments (S.) II-III form a common trunk and S. IV duct joins it. Ib (10 %) : common trunk formed by ducts from S. II-S. III while S. IV duct joins the common hepatic duct. IIa (16. 67 %) : S. IV duct drains into S. III duct. IIc (3. 33 %) : S. IV duct drains into both S. II and S. III ducts. III (3. 33 %) : trifurcation of S. II, S. III and S. IV ducts. When the virtual <b>hepatotomy</b> line was on the FL, there was a single duct for the anastomosis in 30 % of cases but two, three, or four ducts in 53. 3 %, 10 %, and 3. 3 %, respectively. Division 1 cm {{to the right of}} the FL resulted in one duct (70 %), but S. IV duct injury may occur. LLS <b>hepatotomy</b> should not necessarily be performed along the FL. Variations must be taken into consideration to minimize the number of biliary anastomoses during liver implantation. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S...|$|E
40|$|A 62 -year-old {{woman was}} {{presented}} at the emergency department with cholangiosepsis. She had a history of liver metastases for which she had a left hemihepatectomy and loco regional recurrence at the liver hilum for which she received chemoradiation therapy MR-imaging of the liver showed multiple intrahepatic fluid collections/abscesses, together with significantly dilated intrahepatic bile ducts. For her significant hepatic function impairment she received antibiotic treatment and percutaneous drainage. The differential diagnosis was local tumor recurrence or post radiation fibrosis causing outflow obstruction centrally in the liver hilum. During the admission the serum bilirubin values kept rising. During surgery surgeons decided to perform a <b>hepatotomy</b> and connect a loop of the jejunum directly on the liver parenchyma, in order to allow better drainage. Intra operatively, after the <b>hepatotomy,</b> we encountered green-brownisch putty-like material. By traction a 'cast' of {{a large part of the}} biliary tree was removed...|$|E
40|$|Definitive {{surgical}} procedures {{were performed on}} 46 patients with strictures of the major bile ducts: dilatation of strictures was undertaken in 6 patients, <b>hepatotomy</b> and plastic repair in 2, biliary-enteric anastomosis in 18, and liver resection with or without drainage {{for the rest of}} the biliary tree in 20 patients. The overall operative morbidity was 21. 7 per cent. Two patients died within 30 days of operation. One patient died of septicaemia after emergency dilatation of stricture while another died of sepsis from a leakage after <b>hepatotomy</b> and plastic repair. The median follow-up for the 44 patients who survived the operation was 43 months. All strictures reformed after dilatation within 2 months. Acute cholangitis occurred in six patients, two after dilatation of strictures (with documented recurrent stone formation in one), two after biliary-enteric anastomosis and two after liver resection. Thus, good clinical results were obtained in 38 out of 44 patients (86. 4 per cent). link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Background: Liver {{donors are}} {{subjected}} to specific postresection hemodynamic changes. The aim was to monitor these changes and to evaluate the effect of magnesium sulfate infusion (MgSO 4) on these changes together with total anesthetic agents consumption. Patients and Methods: A total of 50 donors scheduled for right <b>hepatotomy</b> {{were divided into two}} equal groups. Controls (C) received saline and magnesium group (Mg) received MgSO 4 10 % (30 mg/kg over 20 min) administered immediately after induction of anesthesia, followed by infusion (10 mg/kg/h) till the end of surgery. Hemodynamics, transesophageal Doppler (TED) data and anesthetic depth guided by Entropy were recorded. Results: Postresection both groups demonstrated an increase in heart rate (HR) and cardiac output (COP) in association with lowering of systemic vascular resistance (SVR). The increase in HR with Mg was lower when compared with C, P = 0. 00. Increase in COP was lower with Mg compared to (C) (6. 1 ± 1. 3 vs. 7. 5 ± 1. 6 L/min, P = 0. 00) and with less reduction in SVR compared to C (1145 ± 251 vs. 849. 2 ± 215 dynes. s/cm 5, P < 0. 01), respectively. Sevoflurane consumption was lower with Mg compared to C (157. 1 ± 35. 1 vs. 187. 6 ± 25. 6 ml, respectively, P = 0. 001). Reduced fentanyl and rocuronium consumption in Mg group are compared to C (P = 0. 00). Extubation time, postoperative patient-controlled fentanyl were lower in Mg than C (P = 0. 001). Conclusion: TED was able to detect significant hemodynamic changes associated with major <b>hepatotomy.</b> Prophylactic magnesium helped to reduce these changes with lower anesthetic and analgesics consumption and an improvement in postoperative pain relief...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Ectopic pelvic liver is an {{exceedingly}} rare condition usually resulting after repair of congenital abdominal wall defects. Intrahepatic gallbladder is another rare condition predisposing patients to cholelithiasis and its sequelae. We describe a cholecystectomy {{in a patient}} with an intrahepatic gallbladder in a pelvic ectopic liver. Presentation of Case. A 33 -year-old woman {{with a history of}} omphalocele repair as an infant presented with signs and symptoms of symptomatic cholelithiasis and chronic cholecystitis, however, in an unusual location. After extensive workup and symptomatic treatment, cholecystectomy was recommended and performed via laparotomy and <b>hepatotomy</b> using microwave technology for parenchymal hepatic transection. Discussion. Given the rare combination of an intrahepatic gallbladder and an ectopic pelvic liver, advanced surgical techniques must be employed for cholecystectomies, in addition to involvement of hepatobiliary experienced surgeons due to the distortion of the biliary and hepatic vascular anatomy. Conclusion. Cholecystectomy by experienced hepatobiliary surgeons is a safe and effective treatment for cholecystitis in patients with intrahepatic gallbladders in ectopic pelvic livers...|$|E
40|$|From 1979 to 1984, 1000 {{patients}} with hepatic injuries were treated at one urban trauma center. Penetrating wounds {{were present in}} 86. 4 % of patients. Simple hepatorrhaphy, use of topical hemostatic agents, or drainage alone were the only forms of therapy required in 881 patients, and 65 (7. 3 %) died. Extensive hepatorrhaphy or <b>hepatotomy</b> with selective vascular ligation, resectional debridement or resection, selective hepatic artery ligation, or perihepatic packing were required, often in combination, in 119 patients, and 40 (33. 6 %) died. Uncomplicated recoveries occurred in 798 of the 918 patients (86. 9 %) surviving greater than 48 hours. In the remaining 13. 1 % of patients, intra-abdominal abscess formation {{was the most common}} late complication (32 / 918 = 3. 5 %).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Liver {{vascular}} {{isolation is}} essential for the treatment of the retrohepatic vena cava and hepatic veins. Triple vessel occlusion (TVO - occlusion of the portal triad, the inferior vena cava above the renal veins and within the pericardium) is the easiest isolation method for the surgeon. Unfortunately, this technique cannot be applied to hypovolemic and/or shock (cardiac arrest) patients as it compromises venous return. OBJECTIVES: Our objective is to demonstrate that in the above mentioned patients, establishing a previous hypervolemic state allows the safe use of TVO. METHODS: The method includes efficient injury tamponade with aggressive fluid replacement until normal blood volume is reached (resuscitation). Normal blood volume is recognized by a return of arterial blood pressure to normal levels, inferior vena cava filling and an increase in aortic wall tension. Following this procedure, hypervolemia is obtained by the rapid additional infusion of 1. 500 to 2. 000 ml of fluids. TVO in this situation does not alter the heart rhythm and maintains a clear operative field which {{is essential for}} <b>hepatotomy,</b> venorrhaphy and or venous ligation. RESULTS: Three patients were successfully operated...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Blunt and {{penetrating}} liver {{trauma is}} common and often presents major diagnostic and management problems. METHODS: A literature review was undertaken {{to determine the}} current consensus on investigation and management strategies. RESULTS: The liver is the most frequently injured organ following abdominal trauma. Immediate assessment with ultrasound has replaced diagnostic peritoneal lavage in the resuscitation room, but computerised tomography remains the gold standard investigation. Nonoperative management is preferred in stable patients but laparotomy is indicated in unstable patients. Damage control techniques such as perihepatic packing, <b>hepatotomy</b> plus direct suture, and resectional debridement are recommended. Major complex surgical procedures such as anatomical resection or atriocaval shunting are now thought to be redundant in the emergency setting. Packing is also recommended for the inexperienced surgeon to allow control and stabilisation prior to transfer to a tertiary centre. Interventional radiological techniques are becoming more widely used, particularly in patients who are being managed nonoperatively or have been stabilised by perihepatic packing. CONCLUSIONS: Management of liver injuries has evolved significantly throughout the last two decades. In the absence of other abdominal injuries, operative management can usually be avoided. Patients with more complex injuries or subsequent complications should be transferred to a specialist centre to optimise final outcome...|$|E
40|$|Background. Biliobronchial fistula (BBF) {{is a rare}} {{complication}} in {{the natural}} history of liver hydatid disease by Echinococcus granulosus. We present a case of BBF after resection of a giant liver hydatid cyst in a 72 -year-old woman. Case Report. A total cystpericystectomy was done, leaving the left lateral section of the liver that was fixed to the diaphragm. Postoperatively, the patient developed obstructive jaundice. An ERCP showed an obstruction at the junction of the left biliary duct and the main biliary duct and contrast leak. At reoperation, the main duct was ischemic, likely due to torsion along its longitudinal axis. A <b>hepatotomy</b> was done at the hilar plate, and the biliary duct was dissected and anastomosed to a Roux-en-Y jejunal loop. She was discharged without complications. Five months later, the patient developed cholangitis and was successfully treated with antibiotics. However, she suffered repeated respiratory infections, and four months later she was admitted to the hospital with fever, cough, bilioptysis, and right lower lobe pneumonia. The diagnosis of BBF was confirmed with 99 mTc Mebrofenin scintigraphy. At transhepatic cholangiography, bile duct dilation was seen, with a biliothoracic leak. She underwent dilatation of cholangiojejunostomy stricture with placement of an external-internal catheter. The catheter was removed 3. 5 months later, and two years later the patient remains in very good condition. Conclusion. An indirect treatment of the BBF by percutaneous transhepatic dilation of the biliary stenosis avoided a more invasive treatment, with satisfactory outcome...|$|E

40|$|Liver organoids show {{potential}} for development as a tissue replacement therapy for patients with end-stage liver disease, but efficient methods for introducing organoids into host livers have not been established. In this study, we aimed to develop a surgical technique to implant hepatic organoids into the liver and assess their engraftment. Donor hepatocytes were isolated from ROSA 26 C 57 BL/ 6 mice, so that engrafted cells, when implanted into wild-type mice, could be easily identified by X-gal staining. Hepatic organoids were generated by three-dimensional culture in rotating wall vessel bioreactors. We qualitatively and quantitatively compared organoid engraftment to that of single-cell hepatocyte transplants. In addition, we determined {{the effect of adding}} stellate cells to hepatocytes to form co-aggregated organoids and the effect of partial hepatectomy of the host liver on organoid engraftment. Direct orthotopic implantation of hepatic organoids within a <b>hepatotomy</b> site resulted in local engraftment of exogenous hepatocytes with limited durability. Hepatocyte-stellate cell organoids produced more extracellular matrix but did not significantly improve engraftment compared with hepatocyte-alone organoids. Partial hepatectomy of the host liver led to significantly decreased engraftment of organoids. Survival of organoids was limited by the presence of apoptotic hepatocytes within organoids as early as 1  h after implantation. Organoids eventually became necrotic and elicited a chronic inflammatory giant cell reaction similar to a foreign body response. With additional organoid and host factor optimization, direct orthotopic implantation of hepatic organoids may be an approach to introduce large numbers of exogenous hepatocytes into recipient livers...|$|E
40|$|Aim. To {{provide a}} {{retrospective}} analysis of our results and experience in primary surgical treatment of subjects with war liver injuries. Methods. From July 1991 to December 1999, 204 subjects with war liver injuries were treated. A total of 82. 8 % of the injured were with the liver injuries combined with the injuries of other organs. In 93. 7 %, the injuries were caused by fragments of explosive devices or bullets of various calibers. In 140 (68. 6 %) of the injured there were minor lesions (grade I to II), treated with simple repair or drainage. There were complex injuries of the liver (grade III-V) in 64 (31. 4 %) of the injured. Those injuries required complex repair (hepatorrhaphy, <b>hepatotomy,</b> resection debridement, resection, packing alone). The technique of perihepatic packing and planned reoperation had a crucial and life-saving role when severe bleeding was present. Routine peritoneal drainage was applied {{in all of the}} injured. Primary management of 74. 0 % of the injured was performed in war hospitals. Results. After primary treatment, 72 (35. 3 %) of the injured were with postoperative complications. Reoperation was done in 66 injured. Total mortality rate in 204 injured was 18. 1 %. All the deceased had significant combined injuries. Mortality rates due to the liver injury of the grade III, IV and V were 16. 6 %, 70. 0 % and 83. 3 %, respectively. Conclusion. Complex liver injuries caused very high mortality rate and the management of the injured was delicate under war circumstances (if the injured reached the hospital alive). Our experience under war circumstances and with war surgeons of limited knowledge of the liver surgery and war surgery, confirmed that it was necessary to apply compressive abdominal packing alone or in combination with other techniques for hemostasis in the treatment of liver injuries grade III-V, resuscitation and rapid transportation to specialized hospitals...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Major hepatic resections {{may result}} in hemodynamic changes. Aim is to study transesophageal Doppler (TED) {{monitoring}} and fluid management in comparison to central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring. A follow-up comparative hospital based study. Methods: 59 consecutive cirrhotic patients (CHILD A) undergoing major <b>hepatotomy.</b> CVP monitoring only (CVP group), (n= 30) and TED (Doppler group), (n= 29) with CVP transduced but not available on the monitor. Exclusion criteria include contra-indication for Doppler probe insertion or bleeding tendency. An attempt to reduce CVP during the resection in both groups with colloid restriction, but crystalloids infusion of 6 ml/kg/h was allowed to replace insensible loss. Post-resection colloids infusion were CVP guided in CVP group (5 - 10 mmHg) and corrected flow time (FTc) aortic guided in Doppler group (> 0. 4 s) blood products given according to the laboratory data. Results: Using the FTc to guide Hydroxyethyl starch 130 / 0. 4 significantly decreased intake in TED versus CVP (1. 03 [0. 49] versus 1. 74 [0. 41] Liter; P> 0. 05). Nausea, vomiting, and chest infection were less in TED with a shorter hospital stay (P 0. 05). Cardiac index and stroke volume of TED increased post-resection compared to baseline, 3. 0 (0. 9) versus 3. 6 (0. 9) L/min/m 2, P> 0. 05; 67. 1 (14. 5) versus 76 (13. 2) ml, P> 0. 05, respectively, associated with a decrease in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) 1142. 7 (511) versus 835. 4 (190. 9) dynes. s/cm 5, P> 0. 05. No significant difference in arterial pressure and CVP between groups at any stage. CVP during resection in TED 6. 4 (3. 06) mmHg versus 6. 1 (1. 4) in CVP group, P= 0. 6. TED placement consumed less time than CVP (7. 3 [1. 5] min versus 13. 2 [2. 9], P> 0. 05). Conclusion: TED {{in comparison to the}} CVP monitoring was able to reduced colloids administration post-resection, lower morbidity and shorten hospital stay. TED consumed less time to insert and was also able to present significant hemodynamic changes. Advanced surgical techniques of resection {{play a key role in}} reducing blood loss despite CVP more than 5 cm H 2 O. TED fluid management protocols during resection need to be developed...|$|E
