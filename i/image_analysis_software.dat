25|$|Fluoroscopy {{is similar}} to {{radiography}} and X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT) in that it generates images using X-rays. The original difference was that radiography fixed still images on film whereas fluoroscopy provided live moving pictures that were not stored. However, today radiography, CT, and fluoroscopy are all digital imaging modes with <b>image</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>software</b> and data storage and retrieval.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{owing to}} {{technological}} convergence, the word fluoroscopy is widely {{understood to be}} a hypernym of all the earlier names for moving pictures taken with X-rays, both live and recorded. Also owing to technological convergence, radiography, CT, and fluoroscopy are now all digital imaging modes using X-rays with <b>image</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>software</b> and easy data storage and retrieval. Just as movies, TV, and web videos are to a substantive extent no longer separate technologies but only variations on common underlying digital themes, so too are the X-ray imaging modes. And indeed, the term X-ray imaging is the ultimate hypernym that unites all of them, even subsuming both fluoroscopy and 4DCT. However, it may be many decades before the earlier hyponyms fall into disuse, not least because the day when 4D CT displaces all earlier forms of moving X-ray imaging may yet be distant.|$|E

30|$|The surface {{morphology}} of the electrospun fibers was observed on a JEOL JSM- 5600 LV {{scanning electron microscope}} (JEOL Ltd., Akishima, Tokyo, Japan) at an acceleration voltage of 10 to 25 kV. The samples for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were dried under vacuum, mounted on metal stubs, and sputter-coated with gold.

25|$|Multicolor FISH and {{the older}} {{spectral}} karyotyping are molecular cytogenetic techniques used to simultaneously visualize all the pairs of chromosomes in an organism in different colors. Fluorescently labeled probes for each chromosome are made by labeling chromosome-specific DNA with different fluorophores. Because there are {{a limited number of}} spectrally distinct fluorophores, a combinatorial labeling method is used to generate many different colors. Fluorophore combinations are captured and analyzed by a fluorescence microscope using up to 7 narrow-banded fluorescence filters or, in the case of spectral karyotyping, by using an interferometer attached to a fluorescence microscope. In the case of an mFISH image, every combination of fluorochromes from the resulting original images is replaced by a pseudo color in a dedicated <b>image</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>software.</b> Thus, chromosomes or chromosome sections can be visualized and identified, allowing for the analysis of chromosomal rearrangements.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{over time}} the cameras and {{recording}} media for fluoroscopic imaging have progressed as follows. The original kind of fluoroscopy, and the common kind for its first half century of existence, simply used none, because for most diagnosis and treatment, they weren't essential. For those investigations {{that needed to be}} transmitted or recorded (such as for training or research), movie cameras using film (such as 16 mm film) were the medium. In the 1950s, analog electronic video cameras (at first only producing live output but later using video tape recorders) appeared. Since the 1990s, there have been digital video cameras, flat panel detectors, and storage of data to local servers or (more recently) secure cloud servers. Late-model fluoroscopes all use digital image processing and <b>image</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>software,</b> which not only helps to produce optimal image clarity and contrast but also allows that result with a minimal radiation dose (because signal processing can take tiny inputs from low radiation doses and amplify them while to some extent also differentiating signal from noise).|$|E
2500|$|The wide {{scope of}} surveys makes them ideal for astronomers searching for moving {{foreground}} {{objects such as}} asteroids and comets.

50|$|The {{advantage}} of this method, aside from its relatively straightforward nature, {{is the fact that}} with a large enough solid surface, multiple droplets can be deposited in various locations on the sample to determine heterogeneity. The reproducibility of particular values of the contact angle will reflect the heterogeneity of the surface’s energy properties. Conversely, the disadvantage is that if the sample is only large enough for one droplet, then {{it will be difficult to}} determine heterogeneity, or consequently to assume homogeneity. This is particularly true because conventional, commercially available goniometers do not swivel the camera/backlight set up relative to the stage, and thus can only show the contact angle at two points: the right and the left edge of the droplet. In addition to this, this measurement is hampered by its inherent subjectivity, as the placement of the lines is determined either by the user looking at the pictures or by the <b>image</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>software’s</b> definition of the lines.|$|R

40|$|Vessels {{responsible}} for stomach blood supply have their {{origin in the}} celyac artery, abdominal aorta first branch, in the aortic hiatus region. Thus, the stomach surface receives the left and right gastric arteries, the left and right gastroepiploic arteries and the breves gastric arteries. Origins of these vessels are well-known, but information about stomach surface arterial distribution are still unknown. Stomach surface blood supply has an important role on gastric mucosa defense mechanisms. Equines submitted to intensive training show high frequency of the ulcerative lesions in the gastric mucosa, with is a promising field of applicability for researches on vascularization.

50|$|Disadvantages: many PSDs are {{concerned}} with particles too small for separation by sieving to be practical. A very fine sieve, such as 37 μm sieve, is exceedingly fragile, {{and it is very}} difficult to get material to pass through it. Another disadvantage is that the amount of energy used to sieve the sample is arbitrarily determined. Over-energetic sieving causes attrition of the particles and thus changes the PSD, while insufficient energy fails to break down loose agglomerates. Although manual sieving procedures can be ineffective, automated sieving technologies using <b>image</b> fragmentation <b>analysis</b> <b>software</b> are available.

40|$|Abstract Background Biological imaging is an {{emerging}} field, covering {{a wide range}} of applications in biological and clinical research. However, while machinery for automated experimenting and data acquisition has been developing rapidly in the past years, automated <b>image</b> <b>analysis</b> often introduces a bottleneck in high content screening. Methods Wndchrm is an open source utility for biological <b>image</b> <b>analysis.</b> The <b>software</b> works by first extracting image content descriptors from the raw image, image transforms, and compound image transforms. Then, the most informative features are selected, and the feature vector of each image is used for classification and similarity measurement. Results Wndchrm has been tested using several publicly available biological datasets, and provided results which are favorably comparable to the performance of task-specific algorithms developed for these datasets. The simple user interface allows researchers who are not knowledgeable in computer vision methods and have no background in computer programming to apply <b>image</b> <b>analysis</b> to their data. Conclusion We suggest that wndchrm can be effectively used for {{a wide range of}} biological <b>image</b> <b>analysis</b> tasks. Using wndchrm can allow scientists to perform automated biological <b>image</b> <b>analysis</b> while avoiding the costly challenge of implementing computer vision and pattern recognition algorithms. </p...|$|R

50|$|Once {{an image}} is {{acquired}} using high content technology hardware, cell data is extracted from that image using <b>image</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>software.</b> Single cell data or population data {{may be of}} interest, but for both, {{a series of steps}} is followed with varying degrees of user interaction depending on the application and the software being used. The first step is segmenting the cells in the image which provides the software algorithms with the information it needs for downstream processing of individual cell measurements. Next, a user must define the area(s) of interest based on a multitude of parameters, i.e., the area a user wants to measure. After the area of interest has been defined, measurements are collected. The measurements, oftentimes referred to as features, are dictated by the type of data desired from the sample.
