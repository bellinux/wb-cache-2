25|$|After the war Richthofen resumed {{civilian}} life after being {{discharged from the}} army. He studied engineering at a university before rejoining the Reichswehr, the German {{armed forces of the}} Weimar Republic era. In 1933 Hitler and the Nazi Party came to power in Germany, and the Reichswehr was transformed into the Wehrmacht. Richthofen joined the new Luftwaffe. He also served as part of the Condor Legion which supported the Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War. During this time, he recognised the need for close air support in military campaigns and championed the dive bomber, particularly the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka. He also believed in improving <b>ground-air</b> communications, which was put into effect in the Second World War, after his experiences in Spain and Poland. The combination of effective air-ground communications and powerful concentration of dive bombers would lead to personal success for Wolfram {{in the first half of}} the war. By 1941, a high standard of air to ground communications became a uniform facility in the Luftwaffe.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{the first}} time U.S. jet {{aircraft}} entered into battle. Air Force F-86 Sabre jets took control of the skies, as American fighter pilots bested Soviet-built MiG-15 fighters in combat against aircraft, Soviet tactics, and, on some occasions, Soviet pilots of the Soviet 64th Fighter Aviation Corps. World War II-era prop-driven P-51D Mustangs were pressed into the <b>ground-air</b> support role, and large formations of B-29 Superfortresses flew for the last time on strategic bombardment missions.

2500|$|By the 1990s, most Army units had {{replaced}} their older VRC-12 series FM radios {{for the new}} SINCGARS ("SINgle-Channel <b>Ground-Air</b> Radio Systems") family of equipment. Rather than sending a signal along one signal frequency, the SINCGARS radios sent its signals across many frequencies, [...] "hopping" [...] from one frequency to another at lightning speed. This allowed many channels of talk to share an already-crowded frequency spectrum. Later generations of these radios combined the communications security (COMSEC) encryption devices with the receiver/transmitter, making a single easier-to-program unit. Most significant, the SINCGARS radios could send and receive digital traffic with great fidelity. By the advent of Operation Desert Shield, all Army units were deployed using the most secure FM communications in the world. The SINCGARS radios have a failure rate in extreme heat of once every 7,000 hours compared to the VRC-12 series' failure rate of 2–300 hours.|$|E

50|$|On 21 September, with skies clearing, P-47 Thunderbolts of the 405th Fighter Group, 84th Fighter Wing of the U.S. XIX Tactical Air Command {{were able}} to begin a {{relentless}} series of attacks on German ground forces. In addition to missions of opportunity flown by XIX TAC fighter-bombers, CCA was able to call in tactical air strikes against German panzer concentrations. The 4th Armored's {{close relationship with the}} USAAF's XIX TAC and mastery of <b>ground-air</b> tactical coordination was a significant factor in destroying the offensive capability of the German armored formations.|$|E

50|$|The Squadron {{was further}} {{augmented}} by Troop F, 8th Cavalry, {{attached to the}} Squadron as its “eyes and ears.” In the Pineapple Forest Battle of February 1968, the <b>ground-air</b> cavalry team had its greatest victory, killing 180 of the enemy without losing {{one of its own}} number. 1st Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment remained in the field continuously during the Vietnam War from 1967-1972, attached as an independent Squadron to elements of the 101st Airborne Division and took part in 13 campaigns. The Squadron departed Vietnam on 10 May 1972.|$|E
5000|$|Ajo {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{expensive}} ADC radar stations to be constructed, with costs mounting to approximately $7.4 million for 100 structures located within housing, cantonment, operations, <b>ground-air</b> transmitter-receiver (GATR) areas. This site became active in January 1958 with the 612th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron being assigned to the new station under 34th Air Division. Initially, 612th AC&W Squadron operated AN/FPS-20A and AN/FPS-6 radars, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes.|$|E
50|$|On 17 February 1974, the 173rd General Support Squadron {{was formed}} {{as part of}} the 1st Aviation Regiment based at Oakey and {{initially}} operated 6 Pilatus PC-6 Porters. In 1978, the Squadron also received 11 GAF Nomad aircraft. During this time, the Squadron undertook a variety of Army co-operation roles utilising the short take-off and landing characteristics of its aircraft. These included: artillery spotting, troop transport, field resupply, medevac, <b>ground-air</b> liaison. It was also used for survey work in the South Pacific and flood relief in Australia. In 1978, the Squadron was involved in Operation Cenderawasih a mapping program in Irian Jaya in Indonesia with the Indonesian Army.|$|E
50|$|China is {{a fast-growing}} market for {{air traffic control}} equipment. Over the past 10 years, CAAC has spent {{approximately}} $1 billion on air traffic management (ATM) infrastructure improvements. By 2005, China had installed 31 primary radars, 52 secondary radars, more than 1,000 Very High Frequency (VHF) communications systems, over 160 Omnidirectional Range and Distance Measurement Systems (VOR/DMEs), and more than 140 Instrument Landing Systems (ILS) (see Distance measuring equipment). CAAC Air Traffic Management Bureau’s (ATMB) goal over the next 5 years is to improve facilities in the eastern and mid-western sections of the country. The improvements call for a comprehensive data network, new automation-center systems, <b>ground-air</b> voice/data communications, and new en route radars.|$|E
50|$|In September 2004, whilst still Lead Commando, the Group {{deployed}} to the United States on Exercise BLACKHORSE.

5000|$|As the Arab Spring took {{center stage}} in the early parts of 2011, McCain urged that embattled Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak step down, and urged the U.S. to push for {{democratic}} reforms in the region despite the associated risks of religious extremists gaining power: [...] "The best opportunity for a pro-democracy government and not a radical, Islamic government is an open, transparent process." [...] McCain said that overall, [...] "These winds of change are blowing," [...] and might spread to Russia and China as well. [...] As the 2011 Libyan civil war took place, McCain {{was one of the}} strongest Congressional supporters of the 2011 military intervention in Libya by the U.S., NATO, and other countries. In April 2011 he staged a visit to the Anti-Gaddafi forces and the National Transitional Council in Benghazi, the highest-ranking American to do so. There he said, [...] "They are my heroes," [...] and urged that they receive weapons, training, and <b>ground-air</b> support, although not necessarily all from the U.S. [...] Following the successful May 2011 U.S. mission to kill Osama bin Laden, McCain congratulated Obama and the U.S. forces involved and said that “advanced interrogation” methods had not measurably helped produce the information that led knowledge of to the terrorist leader's whereabouts.|$|E

40|$|The <b>ground-air</b> {{pressurization}} of lightweight {{honeycomb sandwich}} structures caused by alternating pressure {{differences between the}} enclosed air within the honeycomb core and the ambient environment is a well-known and controllable loading condition of aerospace structures. However, initial face sheet/core disbonds intensify the face sheet peeling effect of the internal pressure load significantly and can decrease {{the reliability of the}} sandwich structure drastically. Within this paper, a numerical parameter study was carried out to investigate the criticality of initial disbonds in honeycomb sandwich structures under <b>ground-air</b> pressurization. A fracture mechanics approach was used to evaluate the loading at the disbond front. In this case, the strain energy release rate was computed via the Virtual Crack Closure Technique. Special attention was paid to the pressure-deformation coupling which can decrease the pressure load within the disbonded sandwich section significantly when the structure is highly deformed...|$|E
