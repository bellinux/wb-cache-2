40|$|Prolonged cold {{ischemia}} {{has been}} suggested as a factor that will exacerbate later graft arterial disease (GAD), a major limiting factor for long-term transplant survival. We therefore {{examined the effects of}} cold ischemia on GAD as well as adhesion molecule and cytokine expression in murine cardiac grafts. Mild GAD developed in <b>isografts</b> undergoing 4 -hour cold ischemia. Relative to control <b>isografts,</b> cold ischemia induced transiently enhanced endothelial expression of intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1) at 4 hours post-transplant. There was also transiently-augmented gene expression of interleukin (IL) − 1 β, IL- 6, and transforming growth factor-β in these cold-ischemic <b>isografts.</b> By 3 days post-transplantation, however, there were no longer any differences between control and cold ischemic <b>isografts.</b> Cold ischemia did not significantly affect the final grade of either parenchymal rejection or GAD in long-term (4 to 12 weeks) major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I- or MHC II-mismatched allografts molecules transplanted without immunosuppression. At early time points after cold ischemia (4 to 24 hours), allografts mismatched for MHC I and/or MHC II showed enhanced expression of ICAM- 1 and cytokines comparable to that seen in <b>isografts.</b> By day 7 post-transplant, both control and cold ischemia allografts showed comparable expression of cytokines and adhesion molecules. Although prolonged cold ischemia can initiate mild GAD in <b>isografts</b> by transiently enhancing antigen non-specific inflammatory responses, it does not significantly augment subsequent alloresponses...|$|R

ALS given within 14 days of disease onset gradually reversed hyperglycemia with a 76 % cumulative incidence of remission. Combined use of anti-CD 4 and anti-CD 8 monoclonal antibodies, but not anti-CD 4 or anti-CD 8 antibody alone, was also effective with overall 64 % remission. Diabetic NOD mice that {{failed to respond to}} ALS treatment accepted subsequent islet <b>isografts</b> for a prolonged period (mostly greater than 100 days), whereas islet <b>isografts</b> in diabetic NOD mice previously treated with normal rabbit serum were all destroyed as acutely as <b>isografts</b> in untreated diabetic NOD mice. These results suggest that persistence of diabetes was due to irreversible beta-cell destruction and that ALS has indeed abrogated autoimmunity. In addition, ALS treatment at the time of islet <b>isografting</b> achieved significant prolongation of graft survival with 8 of 13 mice maintaining euglycemia for greater than 100 days. Although ALS prolonged islet allograft survival in diabetic NOD mice, the degree of prolongation was much less for allografts than for <b>isografts,</b> suggesting that ALS is capable of suppressing autoimmunity more effectively than allograft responses...|$|R
40|$|Allograft {{rejection}} {{is associated}} with infiltration of inflammatory cells and deposition of extracellular matrix proteins. The extent to which diversity in the extracellular matrix regulates inflammatory cell function in transplants remains unclear. One group of extracellular matrix proteins, termed fibronectins (FNs), exhibits inherent diversity {{as a consequence of}} alternative splicing in three segments: EIIIA, EIIIB, or V. Although the EIIIA segment has documented functions in mesenchymal cell differentiation, neither this segment nor the EIIIB segment have been tested for effects specific to leukocyte functions. By contrast, the V region can include the CS- 1 segment to which leukocytes may adhere through alpha 4 beta 1 integrins. In this study, we demonstrate that EIIIA+, EIIIB+, and V+ FN variants are synthesized, primarily by macrophages in distinct temporal and spatial patterns in two rat cardiac transplant models: either with antigenic challenge, allografts, or without challenge, <b>isografts.</b> The ratio of EIIIA inclusion into FN increases by day 1 in allografts and <b>isografts</b> and remains high until allografts are rejected (approximately 7 days) but falls to normal levels in tolerated <b>isografts</b> (day 6). EIIIB+ FN ratios in allografts peak later than do EIIIA+ FNs (day 4). EIIIB+ FN ratios remain relatively low in <b>isografts.</b> Interestingly, EIIIA+ and EIIIB+ FNs are deposited prominently in the myocardium of rejecting allografts in close association with infiltrating leukocytes, and FN expression and deposition are prominent at sites of infarction. By contrast, these FNs are largely restricted to the epicardium and to a lesser degree in the immediately adjacent myocardium in <b>isografts.</b> CS- 1 + FNs increase in allografts and <b>isografts</b> at 3 hours after transplantation but are particularly prominent in allografts 1 to 3 days before rejection. Our data suggest that FN splicing variants have a differential role in the effector functions of leukocytes in allografts and <b>isografts</b> and provide a foundation for testing their function on leukocytes and a rationale for FN-based therapeutics to modulate allograft rejection in transplant recipients...|$|R
40|$|The in vivo {{mechanisms}} of vascular endothelial activation and VCAM- 1 expression were studied in murine heterotopic cardiac grafts. Preliminary studies demonstrated that cardiac allograft endothelia develop reactivity with MECA- 32 monoclonal antibody (MAb) and M/K- 2 (anti-VCAM- 1) MAb within 3 days of transplantation, whereas cardiac isografts develop MECA- 32 reactivity but no M/K- 2 reactivity. Additional studies demonstrated {{that a single}} treatment of cardiac <b>isograft</b> recipients with the anti-CD 3 MAb 145 - 2 C 11 induces VCAM- 1 expression on <b>isograft</b> microvascular endothelia within 24 hours. We have used this experimental system to identify the cytokines responsible for expression of VCAM- 1 and MECA- 32 MAb reactivity on graft vascular endothelia. We report that the expression of VCAM- 1 on <b>isograft</b> endothelia that was induced with anti-CD 3 MAb was blocked by simultaneous treatment with either pentoxifylline, soluble tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor (TNFR-Fc), anti-IL 4 MAb, or soluble IL 4 R, but not by anti-IFN-gamma MAb. Alternatively, a similar pattern of <b>isograft</b> endothelial VCAM- 1 expression was stimulated {{in the absence of}} anti-CD 3 MAbs with a single injection of human recombinant TNF-alpha, or with recombinant murine IL 4 provided as IL 4 /anti-IL 4 MAb complexes. In addition, the IL 4 -induced VCAM- 1 expression was completely blocked by a single intravenous treatment of the <b>isograft</b> recipients with TNFR:Fc. This suggests that high concentrations of TNF-alpha can stimulate endothelial VCAM- 1 expression, but these concentrations are apparently not achieved in cardiac isografts. In the absence of an inducing agent such as anti-CD 3 MAb, the stimulation of VCAM- 1 expression with exogenous IL 4 may reflect functional interaction between endogenous TNF and exogenous IL 4, as suggested by the blocking experiments with TNFR:Fc. Although cardiac <b>isograft</b> endothelia normally develop reactivity with MECA- 32 MAb within 3 days of transplantation, treatment of cardiac <b>isograft</b> recipients with anti-CD 3 MAb accelerated MECA- 32 reactivity to within 24 hours of transplantation. This accelerated expression can be experimentally manipulated {{in the same way as}} M/K- 2 reactivity, suggesting that similar mechanisms may control the development of these two inflammatory endothelial phenotypical markers, despite their differential expression in cardiac isografts and allografts...|$|E

We sought to investigate on a functional and cellular level if inhaled nanoparticle tacrolimus administered to the donor lung before procurement could similarly attenuate ischemia-reperfusion injury after lung transplant. MethodsAn isogenic orthotopic rat model of single left lung transplant was used. Donor animals were pretreated with inhaled tacrolimus (treatment group) or inhaled lactose (controls) before lung procurement. Lung grafts were subjected to 3 hours of cold ischemia followed by 4 hours of reperfusion after graft implantation. Recipient animal arterial blood gas measurement and <b>isograft</b> wet to dry weight ratios were obtained. Macrophage, neutrophil, and T-cell accumulation and activation in lung isografts, including γδ T-cell, T-helper, and cytotoxic T-cell subtypes were analyzed by flow cytometry. Tacrolimus levels were measured in the lung <b>isograft</b> using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. <b>Isograft</b> cytokine levels were measured with commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and microbead array kits. ResultsOxygenation in treatment group animals was significantly higher than in controls. The presence of macrophages, neutrophils, and all T-cell subtypes in the isografts as well as <b>isograft</b> levels of inflammatory cytokines were all less in the treatment group versus controls, although no single variable achieved statistical significance.

40|$|Bilateral native {{nephrectomy}} improves renal <b>isograft</b> {{function in}} rats. Bilateral native nephrectomy {{has been suggested}} to improve renal allograft survival in man. This effect may be most prominent in patients experiencing acute tubular necrosis following transplantation. Thus, native kidneys may alter the course of ischemic acute tubular necrosis in the transplanted kidney. In the present studies, we utilized an experimental model of syngeneic transplantation in which rejection does not occur. We studied Lewis rat renal isografts transplanted into littermates following sham, unilateral or bilateral native nephrectomy. In a fourth group of rats, we evaluated the importance of native kidney excretory function by studying isografts transplanted into littermates with bilaterally obstructed native kidneys. Renal blood flow and excretory function were measured in vivo, eight days following transplantation. Renal excretory function of isografts transplanted into animals following bilateral native nephrectomy was similar to normal nontrans-planted Lewis kidneys. The presence of either one or both functioning native kidneys significantly reduced <b>isograft</b> inulin clearance, PAH clearance, and blood flow. However, when isografts were transplanted into Lewis rats with bilaterally obstructed native kidneys, renal <b>isograft</b> inulin clearance and blood flow were not significantly impaired Non-transplanted kidneys demonstrated “functional hypertrophy” following contralateral nephrectomy, with glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow increasing by approximately 50 %. In contrast, <b>isograft</b> glomerular filtration rate in animals following bilateral native nephrectomy was equivalent to that of single kidneys from normal animals with both kidneys in situ. However, renal blood flow of isografts from these animals increased to {{the same level as}} nontransplanted Lewis kidneys following contralateral nephrectomy. Histological examination of isografts from animals with functioning native kidneys in situ demonstrated extensive disruption of normal renal architecture with tubular and interstitial injury. This was in marked contrast to the appearance of Lewis–Brown Norway allografts, to isografts from animals following bilateral native nephrectomy, and to isografts from animals with bilaterally obstructed native kidneys. In Lewis–Brown Norway allografts, there was evidence of rejection with active inflammatory cell infiltration, arteriolitis and venulitis. In isografts from animals following bilateral native nephrectomy or with bilaterally obstructed native kidneys, renal architecture was normal. Thus, the detrimental effect of native kidneys on <b>isograft</b> function may be related to impaired recovery from ischemia or potentiation of ischemic injury which occurs during the transplantation procedure...|$|E
40|$|In mice, when weak histoincompatibilities prevail, {{orthotopic}} skin transplants from neonatal donors may {{be permanently}} accepted, {{or at least}} survive longer than those from genetically equivalent adults (1 - 4).

This {{study was designed to}} examine whether a dental pulp could be a candidate of donor for nerve grafting in xenografting model. The dental pulp was obtained from a human vital extracted tooth for orthodontic treatment, and treated with freezing and thawing method for reducing antigenicity. The treated sample was inserted into chitosan mesh tube for easy suturing, and then the complex was implanted into transected sciatic nerve in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (dental pulp group). As controls, chitosan tubes with and without sciatic nerve harvested from another SD rats were implanted (<b>isograft</b> group and tube group, respectively). As early as four weeks after grafting, regenerating axons accompanied by host Schwann cells were found to grout out through basal laminae by electron microscopy. The intact structure of basal laminae at this period suggested that they were derived from the original structure of donor graft. Twelve weeks after grafting, sporadic axonal regeneration was confirmed by light microscopy in the dental pulp group. Thirty-two weeks after implantation, aggregation of axons was observed in this group and matched that in <b>isograft</b> group. The average diameter of axons in dental pulp group was comparable to that in <b>isograft</b> group, whereas number of minifascicles and axon proportion were smaller.

40|$|We {{performed}} a comparative study and evaluated cellular infiltrates and anti-inflammatory cytokine production at different time-points after syngeneic or allogeneic skin transplantation. We observed an early IL- 10 production in syngeneic grafts compared with allografts. This observation prompted us {{to investigate the}} role of IL- 10 in <b>isograft</b> acceptance. For this, we used IL- 10 KO and WT mice to perform syngeneic transplantation, where IL- 10 was absent in the graft or in the recipient. The majority of syngeneic grafts derived from IL- 10 KO donors did not engraft or was only partially accepted, whereas IL- 10 KO mice transplanted with skin from WT donors accepted the graft. We evaluated IL- 10 producers in the transplanted skin and observed that epithelial cells were the major source. Taken together, our data show that production of IL- 10 by donor cells, but not by the recipient, is determinant for graft acceptance and strongly suggest that production of this cytokine by keratinocytes immediately upon transplantation is necessary for <b>isograft</b> survival.

We compared {{four types of}} stressed kidneys: <b>isografts,</b> allografts, host kidneys of mice with <b>isografts</b> and nontransplant kidneys with ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN). After excluding transcripts associated with infiltrating cells and interferon-gamma-induced transcripts, we defined 790 IRITs in <b>isografts.</b> IRITs were remarkably heterogeneous in timing and mechanisms.

Mathematical decomposition of IRIT expression patterns confirmed heterogeneity, separating IRIT changes into component subsets, with an early peak (day 1) showing systemic effects and late peaks that resembled ATN, manifested Tgf-ss 1 effects and recapitulated embryonic development. In allografts IRITs were initially similar to <b>isografts</b> but diverged due to allogeneic injury. The allospecific induction of IRITs was T-cell-dependent but perforin-granzyme-independent, compatible with delayed type hypersensitivity.

40|$|Background: The {{effects of}} {{cyclosporin}} A on accelerated atherosclerosis were studied in an experimental model of aortic isotransplantation. Methods: Seventy-six Lewis rats were studied. Forty-one abdominal aortic <b>isografts</b> were performed and divided into five groups: 2 -day <b>isografts</b> and 15 - and 100 -day <b>isografts</b> {{with and without}} cyclosporin treatment. The remaining rats were divided into seven groups: 15 - and 100 -day sham-operated, with and without cyclosporin administration; 15 - and 100 -day animals with cyclosporin treatment only; and normal controls. Cyclosporin was injected subcutaneously in doses of 10 mg/kg daily for the first 15 days and afterward every other day. Longitudinal sections of the proximal anastomosis and cross sections of the midgraft region were measured with a semiautomatic image-analyzer. Results: Histologic analysis showed that accelerated atherosclerosis was not observed either in NT 2 rats or in nontransplanted animals. In the 15 -day <b>isografts,</b> accelerated atherosclerosis was present in the perianastomotic tract of the recipient aorta in nine of nine NT 15 rats, whereas it was found only in three of nine T 15 animals (p < 0. 02).

This study investigates an alternative to permanent or temporary immunosuppression using a rat model with nerve transplants from Brown- Norway rat donors to bridge defects in the sciatic nerve of Lewis rat recipients as these two inbred strains differ at both major and minor histocompatibility loci. The specific {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate if predegenerated nerve grafts decreased the tissue rejection and improved the neurologic recovery of animals with allogenic nerve grafts to avoid the problems associated with either short- or long-term immunosuppression. The animals in the experimental groups received cyclosporin-A, predegencrated grafts, both, or neither. The predegenerated grafts were produced by division of the nerve three weeks prior to grafting to allow for Wallerian degeneration to occur. The outcome was assessed by measurements stressing functional recovery (sensory testing, gait analysis, joint flexion contracture), studies of muscle recovery (muscle weight and hydroxyproline concentration), and histologic studies (axonal counts and inflammatory reaction). The animals receiving the predegenerated grafts without cyclosporin did have an improved recovery (joint flexion contracture 35 ° ± 8 ° and hydroxyproline ratio 1. 52 ± 0. 16) as compared to the joint flexion contractures and hydroxyproline ratios of the allograft group of animals without either cyclosporin- A or pretreatment and the ungrafted control group (47 ° ± 18 °, 1. 68 ± 0. 34, and 53 ° ± 15 °, 4. 50 ± 0. 27, respectively, p < 0. 01).

METHODS: Orthotopic penetrating corneal transplantation was performed between genetically disparate inbred rats. Fas ligand expression and the phenotype of infiltrating leucocytes were examined by immunohistochemistry. Apoptotic nuclei were visualised in sections of normal rat cornea, rejecting allografts, and time matched <b>isografts</b> by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP biotin nick end labelling (TUNEL) and quantified by video image analysis. Staining with Hoechst dye 33258 was used to confirm the presence of apoptotic nuclei. RESULTS: Fas ligand was expressed on corneal endothelial and epithelial cells during acute corneal graft rejection. At all time points examined, including as early as the fifth postoperative day, the cells infiltrating both corneal <b>isografts</b> and allografts were TUNEL positive. By the 15 th postoperative day, over 90 % of all nuclei, many of which were T cells, were apoptotic. CONCLUSION: Expression of Fas ligand is not downregulated on the cornea during allograft rejection and infiltrating leucocytes in both <b>isografts</b> and allografts die rapidly in situ. Despite the death of the cells believed to be responsible for rejection, <b>isografts</b> survive indefinitely whereas allografts are irreparably damaged...|$|R

40|$|Monitoring human cardiac {{allograft}} rejection {{is currently}} accomplished by endomyocardial biopsy. Available noninvasive methods for identifying rejection have lacked the necessary sensitivity or specificity, or both, for routine clinical application. In vivo phosphorus- 31 (P- 31) {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR) spectroscopy {{has been used for}} monitoring phosphorus metabolism in both animal models and humans. In the present study this technique was employed as a noninvasive means to assess the bioenergetic processes that occur during cardiac allograft rejection in a rat model. Brown Norway rat hearts were transplanted subcutaneously into the anterior region of the neck of Lewis rat recipients (allografts). Control isografts employed Lewis donors and recipients. Phosphocreatine to inorganic phosphate (PCr/Pi), phosphocreatine to beta-adenosine triphosphate (PCr/ATPβ), beta-adenosine triphosphate to inorganic phosphate (ATPβ/Pi) ratios and pH of the transplanted hearts were monitored using surface coil P- 31 NMR spectroscopy (at 4. 7 tesla) daily for 7 days. To allow recovery from the compromise induced by the surgical procedure, the measurements obtained on day 2 were taken as a baseline. PCr/Pi was unchanged or increased in the iso-grafts but decreased continually in allografts, with the difference becoming significant by day 4 when compared with levels in day 2 allografts (p < 0. 005) and by day 3 when compared with levels in the <b>isograft</b> group (p < 0. 05). PCr/ATPβin isografts did not change throughout the study; however, allografts demonstrated a significant decrease as early as day 3 (p < 0. 01), although a significant difference between isografts and allografts did not become manifest until day 4 (p < 0. 005). The ATPβ/Pi {{differences between the two groups}} were similar to those for PCr/ATPβ, achieving a significant difference between groups on day 4 (p < 0. 05). In the <b>isograft</b> group, a significant increase in ATPβ/Pi was present on day 3 (p < 0. 05). The <b>isograft</b> group showed no change in intracellular pH; however, the allograft group demonstrated an initial alkaline shift followed by acidosis. This study, coupled with the development of new methods to apply P- 31 spectroscopy clinically, suggests that the abnormal bioenergetics associated with cardiac allograft rejection may be a useful means for following cardiac transplant patients...|$|E
40|$|Aim/Background: The {{development}} of nerve reconstruction procedures {{as an alternative}} to the present standard procedure of an autologous nerve transplantation is nowadays the focus of interest in clinical research of nerval regeneration. Despite of the neuro-regenerative effect of the immunosuppressive drug FK 506, the high doses used successfully up to now cannot justify the clinical application for nerval regeneration with regard to the side effects. Hence, the aim of this animal experimental study was to compare the neurotrophic effectiveness of a low dose FK 506 treatment on allogenous nerve transplants (allograft) with outcomes of autologous nerve transplants (<b>isograft)</b> to be able to estimate the valency concerning nerval regeneration. Material/Methods: The left sciatic nerve of rats of two strains (LEW and DA) was harvested at a distance of 1, 5 cm. Nerve reconstruction consisted of nerve transplants between rats of the same strain (<b>Isograft</b> n= 8) and between both strains (Allograft n= 8) with FK 506 - application (0, 1 mg/KG). 8 rats underwent no operation and were served as an untreated control group. For the appraisal of a functional nerval regeneration analyses, the Sciatic Functional Index (SFI) and the Ankle Stance Angle (ASA) were carried out after 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks post operationem. The histomorphometric evaluation consisted of the density of Myeln Basic Proteine (MBP) in immunohistochemically stained transversal semi- thin sections of the nerves of the experimental sides and of the non-operated sides after 16 weeks. Data of untreated animals served as references. Results: In all experimental groups nerval regeneration occurred. Superior histomorphometric and functional outcomes were seen in the group Allograft plus FK 506 (0. 1 mg / kg). In this group the histomorphometric parameter and both functional parameters showed a significantly better nerve regeneration than in the <b>Isograft</b> group. Only in the group Allograft plus FK 506 (0. 1 mg / kg) no significant differences to untreated animals were found histomorphometrically. Conclusion: With low dose of FK 506 a clear neuro-regenerative effect on Allograft nerve grafts appeared. Thereby it it possible to keep the side effects low with a high effectiveness of nerval regeneration with regard to a clinical application...|$|E

40|$|Almost all animal {{models for}} chronic {{rejection}} (CR) after lung transplantation (LTx) fail {{to resemble the}} human situation. It was our attempt to develop a representative model of CR in mice. Orthotopic LTx was performed in allografts receiving daily immunosuppression with steroids and cyclosporine. Controls included <b>isografts</b> and mice only undergoing thoracotomy (SHAM). Allografts were sacrificed 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 or 12 weeks after LTx. Pulmonary function was measured repeatedly in the 12 w allografts, <b>isografts</b> and SHAM mice. Histologically, all allografts demonstrated acute rejection (AR) around the blood vessels and airways two weeks after LTx. This decreased to 50 – 75 % up to 10 weeks and was absent after 12 weeks. Obliterative bronchiolitis (OB) lesions were observed in 25 – 50 % of the mice from 4 – 12 weeks. <b>Isografts</b> and lungs of SHAM mice were normal after 12 weeks. Pulmonary function measurements showed a decline in FEV 0. 1, TLC and compliance in the allografts postoperatively (2 weeks) with a slow recovery over time. After this initial decline, lung function of allografts increased more than in <b>isografts</b> and SHAM mice indicating that pulmonary function measurement {{is not a good}} tool to diagnose CR in a mouse. We conclude that a true model for CR, with clear OB lesions in about one third of the animals, but without a decline in lung function, is possible. This model is an important step forward in the development of an idea...|$|R
40|$|The early {{inflammatory}} response within organ allo-grafts is initiated by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) and promotes subsequent alloantigen-primed T cell re-cruitment into and {{rejection of the}} graft. Polymor-phonuclear leukocyte (PMN) -mediated tissue damage is a primary component of the early inflammation in allograft rejection. We sought to compare and eluci-date the mechanism of early PMN infiltration into cardiac <b>isografts</b> and allografts. Despite identical pro-duction of PMN attractant chemokines, PMN infiltra-tion following reperfusion into syngeneic and alloge-neic grafts was not equivalent. PMN infiltration into <b>isografts</b> peaked at 9 to 12 hours post-transplant and quickly resolved. In contrast, PMN infiltration into allografts continued to elevated levels, peaking at 2...|$|R
40|$|Cold {{ischemia}} augments allogeneic-mediated {{injury in}} rat kidney allografts. BackgroundSome clinical studies demonstrate that kidney grafts with prolonged cold ischemia experience early acute rejection {{more often than}} those with minimal ischemia. The mechanism, however, is putative. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to unravel the impact of ischemia on the immune response in rat kidney allografts compared with that in <b>isografts.</b> MethodsTo induce ischemic injury, donor kidneys were preserved for 24 hours in 4 °C University of Wisconsin solution before transplantation. No immunosuppression was administered. The histomorphology according to the BANFF criteria for acute rejection and infiltrating cells were assessed at days 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 post-transplantation. ResultsIn allografts, exposure of the kidney to ischemia led to a significantly earlier onset of interstitial cell infiltration and tubulitis compared with nonischemic allografts. The BANFF score of interstitial cell infiltration was 1 ± 0 vs. 0. 25 ± 0. 29 at day 3 and 2 ± 0 vs. 1. 25 ± 0. 25 at day 4. In contrast, in <b>isografts,</b> the effect of ischemia on the histology was not significant. From day 6, the histologic differences between ischemic and nonischemic grafts disappeared. Ischemia led to a more intense expression of P-selectin (day 1), intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1; day 2), and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II on endothelium and proximal tubular cells (day 2) in both allografts and <b>isografts.</b> Concurrently with the up-regulated ICAM- 1 and MHC expression, significantly more CD 4 + cells and macrophages infiltrated the ischemic allografts at days 2 and 3 and the ischemic <b>isografts</b> at day 4. Importantly, the influx of these cells after ischemia was significantly greater in allografts than in <b>isografts.</b> ConclusionsCold ischemia augments allogeneic-mediated cell infiltration in rat kidney allografts. The earlier onset of acute rejection in 24 -hour cold preserved allografts may be prevented by better preservation or treatment using tailored immunosuppression...|$|R
