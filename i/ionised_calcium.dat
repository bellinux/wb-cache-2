40|$|Myopathy due to {{idiopathic}} hypoparathyroidism is very unusual. We {{report on}} a 30 years-old man referred with complaints of sporadic muscle pain and mild global weakness for 10 years. His physical examination showed normal strength in distal muscle and slightly weakness in the pelvic and scapular girdles with no atrophy. Deep muscle reflexes were slightly hypoactive. Trousseau's and Chvostek's signs were absent. He had bilateral cataract and complex partial seizures. His laboratory tests showed decreased <b>ionised</b> and total <b>calcium</b> and parathyroid hormone and increased muscle enzymes. EMG and muscle biopsy was compatible with metabolic myopathy. After treatment with calcium and vitamin D supplementation he showed clinical, neurophisiological and laboratorial improvement. In conclusion: patients with muscle symptoms, even when non-specific and with normal neurological examination, should have serum calcium checked, as myopathy due to idiopathic hypoparathyroidism, even being rare, is treatable and easy to diagnose...|$|R

Patients. This cross-sectional study involved 40 (mean age: 13. 7 ± 3. 8 years) KS children and adolescents and 80 age-matched healthy subjects. For both patient and control groups, we evaluated serum levels of <b>ionised</b> and total <b>calcium,</b> phosphate, total testosterone, luteinising hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, parathyroid hormone (PTH), 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D), 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D, osteocalcin, bone alkaline phosphatase, and urinary deoxypyridinoline concentrations. We also calculated the z-scores of the phalangeal amplitude-dependent speed of sound (AD-SoS) and the bone transmission time (BTT). Results. KS children and adolescents showed significantly reduced AD-SoS (p< 0. 005) and BTT (p< 0. 0005) z-scores compared to the controls. However, KS patients presented significantly higher PTH (p< 0. 0001) and significantly lower 25 (OH) D (p< 0. 0001), osteocalcin (p< 0. 05), and bone alkaline phosphatase levels (p< 0. 005). Interestingly, these metabolic bone disorders were already present in the prepubertal subjects. Conclusions. KS children and adolescents exhibited impaired bone mineral status and metabolism with higher PTH levels and a significant reduction of 25 -OH-D and bone formation markers.

When large spots exist on a star, the activity level of the chromosphere becomes high; in particular, large chromospheric plages form around sunspot groups. The intensities of certain solar and stellar lines generated in the chromosphere, particularly the lines of <b>ionised</b> <b>calcium</b> (Ca II) and the Hα line of hydrogen, {{are known to be}} indicators of magnetic activity. Observations of the Ca lines in stars of similar age to the Sun even show cyclic variations reminiscent of the 11 year solar cycle. By observing certain infrared lines of Ca II for the 34 superflare stars it was possible to estimate their chromospheric activity. Measurements of the same lines at points within an active region on the Sun, together with simultaneous measurements of the local magnetic field, show that there is a general relation between field and activity.|$|E

While the two observatories functioned together under the control of a director at Kodaikanal, the astronomical observations at Madras were confined only to the measurement of time. The new observatory had a wide array of spectroscopic equipment specially acquired for solar studies. There were instruments to visually examine the prominences around the solar limb and the spectra of sunspots. Photographic studies included daily white light photography of the solar disc and monochromatic chromospheric pictures with the spectroheliograms in the light of <b>ionised</b> <b>calcium</b> and of hydrogen.

40|$|Intracellular calcium {{is a major}} {{determinant}} {{of a wide variety of}} cell functions and thus of organ function. In order to get a clear picture of the intracellular calcium status it is preferable to assess the content of the various intracellular calcium pools as well as the characteristics of the transmembrane calcium movements, Le., the magnitude of the transmembrane Ca 2 + flux upon stimulation and the rate of the subsequent return to baseline levels. The first aim of this study was to establish and evaluate the methods in the laboratory. The methods investigated include atomic absorption spectrometry, graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for the determination of the total cell calcium content, fluorescence spectrophotometry for the determinations of intracellular free Ca 2 + and transmembrane Ca 2 + movements and transmission electron microscopy for the localisation of intracellular calcium. The methods eventually identified as feasible included fluorescence spectrophotometry for the determination of intracellular free Ca 2 + and transmembrane Ca 2 + movements and transmission electron microscopy for the localisation of intracellular calcium. The newly developed fluorescent calcium indicator, fura-PE 3, was presently shown to be the most reliable fluorescent indicator for the intracellular free Ca 2 + determinations. The best method for the calcium localisation by transmission electron microscopy was an adaptation of the antimonate precipitation technique. The following objectives were set in order to contribute to the knowledge in chronic renal failure; examination of the intracellular free Ca 2 + content in the neutrophils of end stage renal failure patients on maintenance haemodialysis treatment, as the result of renal failure, dialysis treatment and medication combined; examination of the characteristics of the transmembrane Ca 2 + movements; investigation of the intracellular calcium distribution in the neutrophils; exploration of a possible link between the alterations in intracellular calcium status and factors known to influence the calcium status, including the lipid composition of the membrane, the oxidative status as reflected by anti-oxidant vitamin levels, as well as the levels of parathyroid hormone, and <b>ionised</b> serum <b>calcium.</b> This study involved 14 chronic renal failure patients on maintenance haemodialysis. An increase in intracellular free Ca 2 +, the magnitude of the transmembrane Ca 2 + flux upon fMLP stimulation and an increase in the rate of the subsequent decrease in intracellular free calcium were found. In separating the patients into those receiving rHuEPO and those not receiving rHuEPO, it was seen that the significance in the increase in intracellular free Ca 2 + could be ascribed to the values obtained in those patients receiving rHuEPO - despite the fact that they were the only patients receiving calcium channel blockers. No overt indications of oxidative stress could be detected by anti-oxidant vitamin levels. Nevertheless, a decrease in the content of specific membrane fatty acids occurred, supporting the previous suggestions of the presence of a mild chronic inflammatory condition in the chronic renal failure patient on maintenance haemodialysis treatment. These results suggest that factors other than those associated with uraemia, such as rHuEPO administration, might result in an increase in intracellular free Ca 2 + in cells of CRF/MHT patients. The magnitude of the rHuEPD-induced increase in intracellular free Ca 2 + and the effects of the various calcium channel blockers need urgent further investigation as ineffective counteraction of the rHuEPO effect, as indicated by the relative ineffectivity of Norvasc, may have serious side-effects.

40|$|Bone mass remains plastic {{throughout}} life and {{is subjected to}} changes due to the relative rate of bone formation and bone resorption (Harada and Rodan, [2003]; Teitelbaum and Ross, [2003]; Teitelbaum, [2006]). The rate of bone formation {{is dependent on the}} commitment and replication of osteoprogenitor cells, their differentiation into functional osteoblasts and the life span of mature osteoblasts (Deng et al., [2008]). Bone marrow is the tissue filling the space between the vascular sinus and bone surfaces in the pores of cancellous bone (Burkhardt et al., [1984]; Hauge et al., [2001]). The bone cavities are filled with soft bone marrow mainly composed of undifferentiated bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) forming a delicate connective tissue stroma that separates haematopoietic and adipose marrow compartments, blood stem cells and vessels (Yin and Li, [2006]). Bone marrow-derived stromal cells are multipotent cells that can give rise to the majority of MSC lineages, including osteoblasts, chondrocytes, fibroblasts, adipocytes, endothelial cells and myocytes (Pittenger et al., [1999]; Caplan, [2005], [2007]). Pre-osteoblasts and osteoblasts (Ducy et al., [2000]), also defined as bone-forming cells, are located along the backbone of the trabeculae. The anatomic location of these cells in the bone tissue is well defined using conventional histological staining (Parfitt, [2001]; Teitelbaum and Ross, [2003]; Eriksen et al., [2007]) and multiple markers {{have been found to be}} immunoreactive against in vitro isolated MSCs or osteoblasts (Tuli et al., [2003]; Sakaguchi et al., [2004]; Sacchetti et al., [2007]; Delorme et al., [2008]). In vitro isolated MSCs or osteoblasts have been used extensively in studies concerning bone cell biology (Wang et al., [2006]; Bielby et al., [2007]; Lisignoli et al., [2007]) and other various purposes, such as transplantation, inflammation or tissue engineering (Nauta and Fibbe, [2007]; Pountos et al., [2007]; Tian et al., [2008]). Only a recent study (Sacchetti et al., [2007]), identifying clonogenic skeletal progenitors with the ability of self-renewal, compared bone MSCs with other osteogenic cell strains and demonstrated, both in vitro and in vivo, that among the different markers evaluated (CD 49 a, CD 63, CD 90, CD 105, CD 140 b, CD 146, STRO- 1 and alkaline phosphatase) only CD 146 was differently expressed in bone MSCs. However, also MSCs from other sources expressed CD 146 at different levels (De Bari et al., [2008]; Delorme et al., [2008]; Widemann et al., [2008]). The identification and characterisation of novel osteoblast-related molecules could help to distinguish MSCs (immature cells) from osteoblasts (mature cells). Therefore, we isolated both MSCs and osteoblasts from bone marrow and trabecular bone of the same subject using methods widely described in literature (Robey and Termine, [1985]; Tuli et al., [2003]; Sakaguchi et al., [2004]; De Bari et al., [2008]; Delorme et al., [2008]). We investigated their phenotype and proliferation rate and performed a gene expression profiling analysis. Notably, gene expression analysis identified collagen XV as the most up-regulated gene in osteoblasts compared to MSCs, leading us to further investigate its expression and localisation in vivo. The expression of collagen type XV was confirmed at the protein level on isolated osteoblasts and it was found to be significantly increased during osteogenic differentiation of MSCs in vitro. Free <b>ionised</b> extracellular <b>calcium</b> significantly down-modulated its expression on osteoblasts. Moreover, by light and electron microscopy on bone tissue biopsies we found high expression of collagen type XV mainly in working osteoblasts forming new bone tissue and in lining osteoblasts. Our data demonstrate that collagen type XV, so far described in the basement membrane of other cell types, is also expressed by human osteoblasts both in vitro and in vivo...|$|R

METHODS: In twenty-eight patients with 22 q 11 DS (median age 12. 5, range 6. 1 - 42. 8 years), serum levels of <b>ionised</b> and total <b>calcium,</b> phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), 25 -hydroxyvitamin D, 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D, osteocalcin and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), and urinary deoxypyridinoline concentrations were evaluated. In these patients, bone mineral density (BMD) was evaluated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) examination, and volumetric BMD (bone mineral apparent density (BMAD)) was calculated. The data obtained from paediatric and adult patients were compared with two age-, sex- and body size-matched healthy subject control groups. RESULTS: Patients with 22 q 11 DS showed a reduced BMAD Z-score compared with controls (P< 0. 001). These patients also had significantly lower ionised (P< 0. 001) and total calcium (P< 0. 05) levels as well as lower PTH levels (P< 0. 05), compared with the controls. In particular, children and young patients with 22 q 11 DS had significantly lower serum osteocalcin levels (P< 0. 001), BSAP levels (P< 0. 001) and urinary deoxypyridinoline concentrations (P< 0. 001) than controls. These results were not confirmed in adults.

The multitude of formulae proposed in the literature are, by mathematical discussion, reduced to variations on a single theme. A second topic is the direct potentiometric measurement of free <b>ionised</b> <b>calcium</b> concentra-tion. Finally we review the literature on the clinical utility of measuring or calculating the free <b>ionised</b> <b>calcium</b> concentration. A century ago, Ringer examined the influence of different constituents of blood on the con-traction of the heart and revealed the role of calcium. L Rona and Takahashi discerned a protein-bound and a diffusable fraction of serum calcium. 2 McLean and Hastings showed that the free <b>ionised</b> <b>calcium</b> has the major physiological effect, ' and established the clinical importance of evaluating the latter fraction. " As long as analytical procedures to measure free calcium were elaborate and their accuracy questionable, the evaluation of the calcium status was based on the measurement of total calcium.

40|$|Calcium {{homeostasis}} after thyroid {{surgery was}} studied during the immediate postoperative period and after one year. One day after hemithyroidectomy <b>ionised</b> <b>calcium</b> decreased whereas basal PTH did not change. EDTA stimulated maximal and total PTH secretion and set-point decreased on postoperative day 1 and normalised on day 7. One year after hemithyroidectomy (n= 10) total calcium and 1. 25 (OH) 2 D 3 decreased. EDTA and calcium infusion {{tests showed that}} maximal and total PTH secretion were unaltered. However, <b>ionised</b> <b>calcium</b> at maximal PTH secretion was reduced, the set-point slightly decreased and the ionised calcium/PTH relation curve left shifted. One year after hemithyroidectomy (n= 45) <b>ionised</b> <b>calcium</b> decreased from 1. 25 ± 0. 05 to 1. 22 ± 0. 04 mmol/L (p= 0. 001) despite an unaltered PTH level (2. 8 ± 1. 0 vs. 3. 1 ± 1. 5 pmol/L, p= 0. 50). The marker of bone resorption 1 CTP decreased. A reduction in <b>ionised</b> <b>calcium</b> was seen only in groups with reduced FT 4. An independent association was found between reduced <b>ionised</b> <b>calcium</b> and altered TSH and FT 4 levels. The peripheral effects of PTH were studied by using a six hour hPTH-(1 - 34) infusion protocol. Induced changes in serum levels of <b>ionised</b> <b>calcium</b> and 1. 25 (OH) 2 D 3 and in urinary excretion of phosphate and n-cAMP, were not altered by a slight reduction in thyroid hormones at 3 months after hemithyroidectomy. Intraoperative PTH, measured immediately after total or near-total thyroidectomy, showed an independent association with postoperatively reduced serum calcium levels. Intraoperative PTH was lower among patients who developed biochemical hypocalcemia (p< 0. 001). Low intraoperative PTH identified the patients who required calcium intravenously within 24 hours postoperatively and predicted biochemical hypocalcemia with a sensitivity and specificity of 90 % and 75 %, respectively. In summary, reduced PTH secretion is the main determinant of transient hypocalcemia after thyroid surgery. Low intraoperative PTH is a feasible predictor of postoperative hypocalcemia. Even minor thyroid surgery, i. e. hemithyroidectomy has sustained effects on calcium homeostasis due {{to the influence of}} reduced thyroid hormones on bone remodelling...|$|E
40|$|An {{isotonic}} {{potassium chloride}} liquid junction minimises {{the effects of}} ionic strength, protein and haematocrit on <b>ionised</b> <b>calcium</b> measurement RBPAYNE From the Department of Chemical Pathology, St James's University Hospital, Leeds LS 9 7 TF, UK SUMMARY. When the reference electrode liquid junction of a Nova 2 analyser was changed to isotonic potassium chloride, increasing the ionic strength of aqueous solutions containing a constant total calcium concentration had a negligible effect on measured <b>ionised</b> <b>calcium.</b> In contrast, measurements using hypertonic potassium chloride, hypertonic sodium formate and isotonic sodium chloride liquid junctions showed significant sample ionic strength effects. Interferences by sample protein concentration and haematocrit were marked with hypertonic, but negligible with isotonic junctions. <b>Ionised</b> <b>calcium</b> values in samples containing 25 mmoVL acetate, bicarbonate, ~-hydroxybutyrate, lactate or pyruvate were all lower by fr. 7 % with an isotonic than a hypertonic potassium chloride junction. Thus, anions that replace bicarbonate during metabolic acidosis have a similar effect on residual liquid junction potential. The clinical usefulness of an isotonic potassium chloride liquid junction needs to be evaluated. The clinically significant positive interference with the measurement of <b>ionised</b> <b>calcium</b> by sample protein concentration I. 2 was suggested by others to be a Donnan effect. ? However, subsequent experiments showed that it dis-appeared when the reference electrodes liquid junction was changed from 2 · 0 moVL KCI or 4 · 6 moUKg HCOONa to 150 mmoVL NaCI; in addition, measurements became significantly more reproducible. " Isotonic NaCI bridges are not used in clinical analysers because their residual liquid junction potential varies with the ionic strength of the sample and is said to vary with its anionic composition. Preliminary ex-periments suggested that variation in ionic strength had little effect when the brid~e was 150 mmoVL KCI rather than NaCI. The purpose of the work described here {{was to determine the}} effects of sample ionic strength, protein concentration, haematocrit and anion composition on <b>ionised</b> <b>calcium</b> measured using a range of reference electrode liquid junctions.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{investigate}} {{changes in}} the electrocardiographic QT interval during rapidly induced, sustained hypocalcaemia in healthy volunteers. DESIGN [...] Serial rate corrected QT measurements were made during and after a variable rate trisodium citrate infusion designed to "clamp" the whole blood <b>ionised</b> <b>calcium</b> concentration 0. 20 mmol/l below baseline for 120 min. SUBJECTS [...] 12 healthy teetotallers aged 19 - 36 years who were not receiving medication known to influence calcium homoeostasis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Whole blood <b>ionised</b> <b>calcium</b> concentration and QaTc intervals (onset of the Q wave to T wave apex divided by the square root of the RR interval). RESULTS [...] Mean (SD) <b>ionised</b> <b>calcium</b> concentration decreased from 1. 18 (0. 03) mmol/l preinfusion to values close to target (0. 98 mmol/l) between 10 and 120 min. The QaTc interval lengthened from a baseline of 0. 309 (0. 021) to a maximum 0. 343 (0. 024) s 0. 5 at 10 min before returning to a stable level from 15 to 120 min (0. 334 (0. 023) and 0. 330 (0. 023) s 0. 5 respectively). The change from baseline of both variables expressed as a ratio (delta QaTc/ delta [Ca 2 +]) was greater during rapid induction of hypocalcaemia (at 5 and 10 min) than at other times {{during and after the}} infusion (P < 0. 02). CONCLUSIONS [...] The disproportionate prolongation of QaTc interval during prompt induction of hypocalcaemia suggests rate dependency which can be represented by a hysteresis relation between (<b>ionised</b> <b>calcium,</b> QaTc) coordinates.

40|$|Abstract. The radio- and chemoprotective agent, S- 2 (3 -aminopropylamino) ethyl-phosphorothioic acid (WR- 2721) {{has been}} {{reported}} to lower hypercalcaemia in patients with cancer, probably by increased renal calcium excretion and decreased parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion and bone calcium resorption. The present study reports the first clinical use of WR- 2721 in an anuric haemodialysis patient with severe secondary hyperpara-thyroidism. The drug was administered intravenously at different doses, i. e. 150, 300, and 500 mg/m 2. The infusion was followed by a striking decrease of plasma immuno-reactive (i) PTH within 30 min. The nadir of the iPTH decrease was reached at 60 min and was followed by a steady return to previous values. Serum <b>ionised</b> <b>calcium</b> decreased more progressively from 1. 55 mmol/l initially to 1. 30 mmol/ 1 at 4 h after the 300 -mg dose, remained at that level at 24 h, but rose again to pre-infusion values after 48 h. The extent and duration of the decrease in plasma iPTH and <b>ionised</b> <b>calcium</b> were dose-dependent. The circulating iPTH at 24 h was inversely related to the corresponding plasma <b>ionised</b> <b>calcium</b> concentration and had risen above preinfusion values at that time. Plasma concentrations of three other hormones, i. e. renin, insulin, and prolactin, were not affected by the administration of WR- 2721. In conclusion, WR- 2721 can induce a decrease in seru...|$|E
40|$|Citrate, as an {{anticoagulant}} {{for continuous}} renal replacement therapy in critically ill patients, has some potential advantages over heparin, including a prolonged dialysis filter life and reduced risk of bleeding. The key parameter involved in monitoring the adequacy {{and safety of}} citrate anticoagulation during continuous renal replacement therapy pertains to the ionised and total plasma calcium levels. We report a case of severe systemic hypocalcaemia during continuous renal replacement therapy with citrate anticoagulation resulting from relentless sequestration of calcium due to undiagnosed evolving rhabdomyolysis. Although excessive systemic citrate accumulation can also cause hypocalcaemia, this complication was not observed in our patient. While an acceptable lower limit of <b>ionised</b> <b>calcium</b> remains unknown, severe rhabdomyolysis needs to be considered when a patient's <b>ionised</b> <b>calcium</b> levels are not responsive to standard calcium replacement therapy during continuous renal replacement therapy using citrate anticoagulation in critically ill patients...|$|E
40|$|Background: A {{number of}} {{anticoagulants}} {{are available in}} clinical use to preserve blood samples in liquid form until a suitable time for laboratory testing. Rotational thromboelastography is usually performed on a blood sample that has been anticoagulated with sodium citrate and then recalcified immediately prior to testing. In our institution we have had shortages of citrated Vacutainer® sample tubes. The use of a single in vitro anticoagulant promises to cut costs, simplify laboratory processes as well as {{limit the amount of}} blood drawn from patients. This together with the known problems with using citrate as an anticoagulant for viscoelastic testing (VET) prompted us to investigate the suitability of EDTA as anticoagulant for VET. Method: Blood samples from 20 healthy volunteers were divided into citrated and EDTA Vacutainer® tubes. A ROTEM EXTEM® assay was performed on each sample in both groups following the manufacturer's guidelines. Clotting time (CT), clot formation time (CFT), alpha angle (α-angle) and maximum clot firmness (MCF) results were compared. <b>Ionised</b> <b>calcium</b> concentrations were measured on each sample before and after recalcification with CaCl 2 to determine if {{there was a significant difference}} in post - recalcification <b>ionised</b> <b>calcium</b> concentrations between the groups. Results: The results from the two groups were treated by Bland-Altman analysis. Apart from MCF values there was significant bias between all parameters measured in the two groups. The limits of agreement for all parameters apart from MCF were unacceptable. Conclusion: We found that ROTEM EXTEM® results from EDTA samples were not comparable to or interchangeable with those from citrated samples. The difference in results is not due to differences in <b>ionised</b> <b>calcium</b> concentration levels in the samples post-recalcification as the <b>ionised</b> <b>calcium</b> concentrations in both groups post-recalcification were adequate for coagulation. EDTA samples did show superior consistency in all parameters and may be a suitable alternative for sample preservation for VET if reference ranges can be established...|$|E
