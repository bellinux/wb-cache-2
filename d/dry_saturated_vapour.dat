40|$|The {{theoretical}} problem solved in {{this article}} is the calculation of thermodynamic parameters such as final temperature, distribution of the liquid and <b>dry</b> <b>saturated</b> <b>vapour</b> phases of the substance that are considered to be in thermodynamic equilibrium, and pressure of the system of several reaction products after adding to the system a certain amount of heat or the thermal effect released during rapid exothermic reaction in a closed volume that occurs so fast that it can be considered to be adiabatic, and when the volume of liquid reagents is several orders of magnitude less than the volume of the reactor. The general multi-substance problem is reduced to a theoretical problem for one substance of calculation thermodynamic parameters of system after adding a certain amount of heat that gives theoretically rigorous isochoric calculation. In this article, we substantiate our view that isochoric pass of calculation is more robust compared to seemingly more natural isobaric pass of calculation, if the later involves quite not trivial calculation of the adiabatic compression of a two-phase system (liquid – <b>dry</b> <b>saturated</b> <b>vapour)</b> that can pass itself into another kind of state (liquid – wet saturated vapour), which requires, apparently, more complex descriptions compared with isochoric calculation because the specific heat capacity of wet saturated vapour can be negative...|$|E

40|$|A multi-variable {{optimization}} {{program has}} been developed to investigate the performance of Organic Rankine Cycles (ORCs) for low temperature heat recovery applications. This cycle model contains detailed thermodynamic models of the system components, and the methods used to match {{the operation of the}} expander to the requirements of the cycle are described. Two types of ORC system are considered; one containing a turbine to expand <b>dry</b> <b>saturated</b> or superheated <b>vapour,</b> and one with a twin-screw machine allowing expansion of partially evaporated fluid. Modelling of the ORC system with a twin-screw expander has been described previously (Read et al. 2014 a, 2014 b). The performance of the turbine in the superheated ORC has been modelled using available operational data for single stage, reaction turbines, where correlations have been used to estimate the efficiency of the turbine at ‘off-design’ conditions using either fixed or variable nozzle geometries. The capability of the cycle model has been demonstrated for the case of heat recovery from a source fluid at 120 °C. The system parameters are optimised for a typical operating condition, which determines the required size of heat exchangers and the expander characteristics. Performance at offdesign conditions can then be optimized within these constraints. This allows a rigorous investigation of the effect of air temperature variation on the system performance, and the seasonal variation in net power output for the turbine and twin-screw ORC systems is estimated...|$|R
40|$|The {{requirements}} for power generation {{systems have been}} reviewed together with the various energy sources available for them. Geothermal energy has been examined in more detail and the principal methods of recovering power from it which are currently employed are discussed. A novel method for improved power recovery from geothermal sources called the Trilateral Flash Cycle (TFC) system is described which has the special requirement of an efficient two-phase expander. Optimum results are obtained from this cycle if a working fluid is used which leaves the expander as <b>dry</b> <b>saturated</b> <b>vapour.</b> A binary mixture of hydrocarbons was therefore sought which by variation of the constituent proportions, would satisfy this requirement {{for a range of}} inlet temperatures when the condensing temperature is constant. Methods of estimating mixture properties are reviewed and the chosen thermodynamic model, as well as a computational procedure for evaluation of vapour-liquid equilibria of organic binary mixtures at high pressures, are described. This is based on the Redlich-Kwong- Soave cubic equation of state. By this means a mixture of n-pentane and 2, 2 -dimethylpropane (neopentane) was found to be the most suitable for the TFC system for expander inlet temperatures between 150 - 180 'C. Temperature-entropy (T-S) diagrams of this organic binary mixture were obtained for several compositions. Bubble and dew pressures of (n-pentane + 2, 2 -dimethylpropane) have been determined experimentally for five different compositions at six different temperatures, (333. 15 K, 353. 15 K, 373. 15 K, 393. 15 K, 413. 15 K, and 433. 15 K). Vapour pressures of pure n-pentane and pure neo-pentane were also determined at these temperatures. The critical point of neo-pentane was measured to assess the accuracy of the isothermal compression apparatus used. Theoretical predictions were found to be in good agreement with experimental measurements...|$|E

40|$|Cavitation {{properties}} of liquid {{must be taken}} into consideration in the engineering design of hydraulic machines and hydro devices when {{there is a possibility that}} in their operation an absolute pressure in the liquid drops below atmospheric one, and for a certain time the liquid is in depression state. Cold boiling, which occurs at a comparatively low temperature under a reduced absolute pressure within or on the surface of the liquid is regarded as hydrostatic cavitation if the liquid is stationary or as hydrodynamic cavitation, if the liquid falls into conditions when in the flow cross-section there is a sharply increasing dynamic pressure and a dropping absolute pressure. In accordance with the theory of cavitation, the first phase of cavitation occurs when the absolute pressure of the degassed liquid drops to the <b>saturated</b> <b>vapour</b> pressure, and the air dissolved in the liquid, leaving the intermolecular space, is converted into micro-bubbles of combined air and becomes a generator of cavitation “nuclei”. A quantitative estimate of the minimum allowable absolute pressure in a real, fully or partially degassed liquid at which a hydrostatic cavitation occurs is of practical interest. Since the pressure of <b>saturated</b> <b>vapour</b> of a liquid is, to a certain extent, related to the forces of intermolecular interaction, it is necessary to have information on the cavitation {{properties of}} technical solutions, including air solution in a liquid, as a solute may weaken intermolecular bonds and affect the pressure value of the <b>saturated</b> solvent <b>vapour.</b> In the experiment to carry out vacuum degassing of liquids was used a hydraulic air driven vacuum pump. The paper presents hydrostatic and hydrodynamic degassing liquid processes used in the experiment. The experimental studies of the cavitation properties of technical liquids (sea and distilled water, saturated NaCl solution, and pure glycerol and as a 49 / 51 % solution in water, mineral oil and jet fuel) enabled us to have an quantitative estimate of the absolute pressure in the allowable technical liquids and solutions, its dependence on the <b>saturated</b> <b>vapour</b> pressure, as well as to define the influence of a degree of the hydrodynamic degassing of liquid and the amount of its solute on the liquid tensile strength. The paper gives a comparative assessment of cavitation properties of liquids. When studying the cavitation properties of solutions it has been found that a level of the allowable absolute pressure in a solution exceeds that of in the solvent.
