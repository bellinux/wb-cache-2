5|$|Although {{historically}} {{many fish}} species used Aliso Creek, {{the only remaining}} one is carp, which is known to survive in areas with high toxicity. Bird life was also abundant in the watershed—and 137species remain <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>less</b> developed areas of the watershed. Some of these birds include California least tern, least Bell's vireo, southwestern willow flycatcher, California gnatcatcher, and western snowy plover. Remaining habitat for native wildlife is now primarily along Wood Canyon Creek, in {{the upper reaches of}} Aliso Creek, and along some parts of English Canyon.|$|E
5|$|Experiments {{are usually}} {{conducted}} using only small quantities {{of a few}} grams in a fume hood. Small quantities of lithium may be disposed of by reaction with cool water, but the heavier alkali metals should be dissolved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>less</b> reactive isopropanol. The alkali metals must be stored under mineral oil or an inert atmosphere. The inert atmosphere used may be argon or nitrogen gas, except for lithium, which reacts with nitrogen. Rubidium and caesium must be kept away from air, even under oil, because even {{a small amount of}} air diffused into the oil may trigger formation of the dangerously explosive peroxide; for the same reason, potassium should not be stored under oil in an oxygen-containing atmosphere for longer than 6 months.|$|E

5|$|For locally {{advanced}} and metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinomas, which together represent over 80% of cases, numerous recent trials comparing chemotherapy regimes have shown increased survival times, {{but not to}} more than one year. Overall five-year survival for pancreatic cancer in the US has improved from 2% in cases diagnosed in 1975–77, and 4% in 1987–89 diagnoses, to 6% in 2003–09. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>less</b> than 20% of cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma with a diagnosis of a localized and small cancerous growth (less than 2cm in Stage T1), about 20% of Americans survive to five years.|$|E
5|$|Per Gessle and Marie Fredriksson {{first met}} in Halmstad, Sweden, {{in the late}} 1970s. Gessle {{performed}} in Gyllene Tider, one of Sweden's most popular bands at the time, and Fredriksson <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>less</b> successful Strul and MaMas Barn (Mama's Children) before both embarked on solo careers. In 1981, Fredriksson sang {{for the first time}} with Gyllene Tider on stage and was featured as a background vocalist for a Swedish-language album the band released in 1982. Gessle also worked with ex-ABBA singer Frida, for a song that appeared on her 1982 album Something's Going On, setting music to a Dorothy Parker poem.|$|E
5|$|Verity {{followed}} this performance with five for 54 against Lancashire, but {{a week after}} his 10 wickets against Warwickshire, Frank Woolley hit four sixes from Verity's bowling as the Yorkshire bowler conceded 70runs from 12overs without taking a wicket. The rest of his season was successful. Favoured by pitches made receptive to his bowling by rain, he recorded impressive performances, earning selection for the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord's Cricket Ground, where he took five wickets in the Gentlemen's first innings. He was also selected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>less</b> prestigious Gentlemen v Players fixtures at The Oval and Scarborough and was awarded his county cap by Yorkshire. Having been watched by England selectors, and after taking 11 wickets for Yorkshire in their match against the touring New Zealand team, Verity was selected {{in the final two}} Test matches of the series between England and the tourists. The first match was drawn after the New Zealand team performed above expectations and England brought in four new players, one of whom was Verity. On his debut, he took four wickets for 75runs in the game. The Cricketer noted room for improvements in his technique but observed he could spin the ball well. England won the match and Verity was retained for the final Test. However, rain disrupted the match and he did not bowl. In his first full season of first-class cricket, Verity took 188wickets at an average of 13.52, finishing on top of the Yorkshire bowling averages and second in the national averages. Yorkshire won the County Championship and, according to Wisden, owed much of their success to Verity's bowling. Verity was selected as one of Wisden's Cricketers of the Year for his performances in the season. However, the citation said that despite his success and ability, he needed to improve the variety in the pace and flight of his bowling.|$|E
