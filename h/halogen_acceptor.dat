40|$|An {{investigation}} {{to determine the}} effect of an infrared post-exposure on the latent image in blue sensitive 3 M Dry Silver film 7842 was performed. The film was first given a step tablet exposure using the unfiltered output of a tungsten source at 2856 K. A Wratten # 87 C filter was used with the same source to provide the second, infrared exposure over one half of the first exposure area. Absolute exposure and exposure reciprocity were tested. Processing was by immersion into a bath of 3 M fluorocarbon FC- 43 maintained at 127 C/ 260 F. The original objective, to cause Herschel effect bleaching of latent image, was not achieved. All IR exposures caused either a density increase, or, at low irradiance, no density change. A quanta ratio of 3 * 106 between the infrared and actinic exposures was obtained using an IR exposure time of 96 hours. The lack of any density decrease due to the Herschel effect apparently gives evidence to the theory that the Herschel effect is a rehalogenation process as reported by Farnell and Birch. The presence of <b>halogen</b> <b>acceptors</b> in the emulsion is believed to prevent the loss of latent image silver atoms due to rehalogenation.

The second objective is a study to see what happens to the development rate and the sensitivity of the residual silver-halide emulsion after first exposure, first development, and bleaching as a function of the first exposure. The sensitivity is expected to drop quite dramatically with increasing first exposure and the results show it does. For the one film tested, PLUS-X Reversal, it was found that the development rate, corrected for change in Dmax, materially decreased with increasing first exposure.

The systematic change of electron density of the pyridine nitrogens upon alteration of the para-substituent (NO 2, CF 3, H, F, Me, OMe, NMe 2) was confirmed by N- 15 NMR and by computation of the natural atomic population and the pi electron population of the nitrogen atoms. Formation of the [N-I-N](+) halogen bond resulted in > 100 ppm N- 15 NMR coordination shifts. Substituent effects on the N- 15 NMR chemical shift are governed by the pi population rather than the total electron population at the nitrogens.

One cocrystal was formed between p-methoxyphenyl tetrazolone and 2 I 4 FB in which two tetrazolones form hydrogen bonded dimer and the neighboring dimers are held by halogen bonds with the -OMe group serving as a <b>halogen</b> bond <b>acceptor</b> and the –I atom on 2 I 4 FB serving as a halogen bond donor resulting into 1 D chains. Furthermore, because of the ubiquitous role played by anions in biology, industry and environment, the anion binding ability of tetrazolones was also investigated with tetrabutylammonium acetate (TBAA), tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) and tetrabutylammonium hydrosulfate (TBAHSO 4) by UV and NMR spectroscopy. Tetrazolones undergo proton transfer with tetrabutylammonium acetate (TBAA). However, no interactions were found with tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB), and tetrabutylammonium hydrosulfate (TBAHSO 4).

40|$|Solid-state nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (SSNMR) {{has proven to be}} a useful tool in the characterization of non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding and cation-π interactions. In recent years, the scientific community has manifested a renewed interest towards an important class of non-covalent interaction, halogen bonding (XB), as it has applications in various fields such as crystal engineering and biological processes. This dissertation demonstrates that NMR parameters measured in the solid state are sensitive to changes in electronic structure, which are caused by halogen bonds. A series of halogen bonded compounds exhibiting interactions between different diiodoperfluorobenzenes (p- C 6 F 4 I 2, o- C 6 F 4 I 2, sym- C 6 F 3 I 3, p- C 6 H 4 I 2) and various <b>halogen</b> bond <b>acceptors</b> have been synthesized as part of this work. These new halogen bonded compounds were characterized with a combined theoretical and experimental SSNMR, X-ray diffraction (XRD) methods. The complete multinuclear {{magnetic resonance}} spectroscopy of the nuclei involved directly in the halogen bond (13 C, 14 / 15 N, 31 P, 77 Se, 35 / 37 Cl and 79 / 81 Br) were recorded at multiple magnetic fields (4. 7, 9. 4, 11. 75 and 21. 1 T). The specialized SSNMR experiments provided high-resolution spectra of quadrupolar nuclei, which were WURST-QCPMG or solid-echo type experiments combined with the variable offset cumulative spectral (VOCS) method, as for spin 1 / 2 nuclei cross polarization magic angle spinning (CPMAS) experiments were usually appropriate. This dissertation will discuss successful applications of SSNMR spectroscopy to characterize halogen bonds, it will demonstrate the significant changes in NMR observables in the presence of XB interaction and thus establish that NMR parameters are very sensitive to halogen bonding interaction. Furthermore, this work explains why the NMR parameters are correlated with the halogen bonding interaction. The different trends observed between the NMR observables and the halogen bonding were further understood with a ZORA-DFT natural localized molecular orbital (NLMO) study...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{propensity}} of the sp 2 sulfur atom in thiones {{to act as}} a <b>halogen</b> bond (XB) <b>acceptor</b> is well established with dihalides (I 2, IBr or ICl) as XB donors, but has been more rarely explored with organic XB donors. The crystal structures of four iodinated heterocycles, namely, the mono- and diiodo derivatives of 1, 3 -dithiole- 2 -thione and N-ethylthiazole- 2 -thione, offer an opportunity to evaluate the strength and directionality of such C-I⋯S interactions. We describe here the original synthesis of 3 -ethyl- 5 -iodothiazole- 2 (3 H) -thione and 3 -ethyl- 4, 5 -diiodothiazole- 2 (3 H) -thione and the solid state structures of the four compounds, with specific attention to the halogen bonds (C-I⋯SC) and hydrogen bonds (C-H⋯I,S) taking place in the crystals, in connection with the peculiarities of the calculated electrostatic surface potential (ESP) of the four molecules. The thione sulfur atoms in thiazole- 2 -thiones appear as better XB acceptors than in dithiole- 2 -thiones, with a notable deformation of the charge concentration area. The mono-iodinated derivatives, 4 -iodo- 1, 3 -dithiole- 2 -thione and 3 -ethyl- 5 -iodothiazole- 2 -thione, are characterized by hydrogen atoms with positive extremum of the electrostatic surface potential comparable to those of the neighboring iodine atoms, illustrating the parallelism between C-I⋯S halogen bonds and the so-called weak C-H⋯I,S hydrogen bonds. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016...|$|R

The cocrystals have the general formula [Ni(phen) 3][(IPFB) n (X 2) (L) m] · solvate (n = 2 or 3; X = Cl – or I –; L = halogen-bonded H 2 O and/or MeOH; solvate = isolated H 2 O and/or MeOH). The halide ions balance the charge of the metal complexes and simultaneously act as <b>halogen</b> bond <b>acceptors</b> for the electronically polarized iodine atoms of the IPFB donors. The structures display a wide variety of supramolecular motifs in the context of both the aggregation of the metal complexes and the topology and connectivity of the halogen bond networks. The well-known supramolecular “aryl embrace” motifs of [Ni(phen) 3] complexes are present but are structurally compromised to varying degrees in the crystals of [Ni(phen) 3][(1, 2 -DITFB) 2 I 2]·MeOH, [Ni(phen) 3][(1, 3 -DITFB) 2 I 2]· 2 MeOH, and [Ni(phen) 3][(1, 3 -DITFB) 2 (H 2 O) 2 Cl 2]· 1. 5 MeOH. In [Ni(phen) 3][(1, 3 -DITFB) 3 I 2], the [Ni(phen 3] 2 + complexes are so thoroughly enclosed in halogen-bonded networks that the metal complexes have no significant supramolecular contact. In contrast, in [Ni(phen) 3][(1, 4 -DITFB) 3 I 2 (MeOH) 0. 5] and [Ni(phen) 3][(1, 3, 5 -TITFB) 2 Cl 2] the complexes are arranged in typical aryl embrace motifs (pairwise and 1 D chains, respectively), but with adjacent complexes held in closer proximity to each other than they reside in crystals of the pure metal complex. The interplay between the supramolecular chemistry of the halogen-bonded networks and the metal complexes was examined in detail, and the results demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} significantly influence the aggregation of metal complexes by encapsulation in different halogen bond networks...|$|R
40|$|Here, {{the effects}} of {{individual}} electron withdrawing groups on halogen bond strength are investigated using Raman spectroscopy and electronic structure calculations. Halogen bonding is a unique and relatively unexplored noncovalent interaction that has recently garnered considerable attention due to its applications in materials development. When a halogen, such as chlorine, bromine, or iodine, accepts electron density from a Lewis base such as the nitrogen of pyridine a halogen bond arises. The anisotropic distribution of electron density about a covalently bound halogen, {{also known as the}} σ-hole, plays a significant role in halogen bond formation. The magnitude of the electropositive region increases from chlorine < bromine < iodine. Using a combination of Raman spectroscopy and computational chemistry, eight halogen bond donors with four unique electron withdrawing moieties were evaluated for use as potential molecular building blocks in organic optoelectronic devices. First, the C-I stretches of the ten monomers were assigned using experimental Raman spectra in junction with computed Raman frequencies and activities. The C-I stretch was tracked as a function of electron withdrawing moiety, producing trends that directly connected donor strength to molecular structure. The observation of a red shift in the C-I stretch of the halogen bond donor suggested an electrostatically stronger σ-hole and thus a greater binding energy with <b>halogen</b> bond <b>acceptors.</b> Additionally the C-I stretch, in twelve co-crystals synthesized from promising donors and acceptors, was assigned and tracked. The change in the C-I stretch for the co-crystals was {{similar to that of the}} monomers. With this, the change in the C-I stretch as a function of complexation was determined by comparing the C-I stretch of the monomeric halogen bond donor with the C-I stretch of the halogen bond complex. The trend observed agreed with that of the C-I stretch within both the monomer and co-crystal systems. Interestingly, the results of this project suggest that although the σ-hole present on the halogen plays a large role in halogen bond formation, the concentrated belt of electron density surrounding the halogen also significantly contributes to halogen bond strength as well as the vibrational characterization of the molecule...|$|R
