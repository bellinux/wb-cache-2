5|$|Before {{and during}} their marriage, Crawford worked to promote Tone's Hollywood career, but Tone was {{ultimately}} not interested <b>in</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> movie star and Crawford eventually wearied of the effort. After Tone reportedly began drinking and becoming physically abusive, she filed for divorce, which was granted in 1939. Crawford and Tone much later rekindled their friendship and Tone even proposed in 1964 that they remarry. When {{he died in}} 1968, Crawford arranged {{for him to be}} cremated and his ashes scattered at Muskoka Lakes, Canada.|$|E
5|$|He again {{excelled in}} {{basketball}} his senior year, leading {{his team to}} the Queens divisional championship and amassing more points than any other New York City high school basketball player. He was even named captain of the Journal-American All-Scholastic team. He then began to plan for college. His family had wanted him to attend a Catholic school, {{and he wanted to}} go somewhere outside New York City. Boston College recruited him, and he considered accepting the BC offer, but it had no dormitories, and he was not interested <b>in</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> commuter student. Soon afterward, he received an offer from the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts about forty miles (64 kilometers) west of Boston. He was impressed by the school, and accepted the basketball scholarship it offered him. He spent the summer before matriculating working at Tamarack Lodge in the Catskill Mountains and playing in a local basketball league along with a number of established college players.|$|E
5|$|In November 1978, Christina Crawford {{published}} Mommie Dearest, {{which contained}} allegations that her late adoptive mother was emotionally and physically abusive to Christina {{and her brother}} Christopher because she {{was more interested in}} her career than <b>in</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> mother. Many of Crawford's friends and co-workers, including Van Johnson, Ann Blyth, Marlene Dietrich, Myrna Loy, Katharine Hepburn, Cesar Romero, Gary Gray, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (Crawford's first husband), and Crawford's two other younger daughters—Cathy and Cindy—denounced the book, categorically denying any abuse. But others, including Betty Hutton, Helen Hayes, James MacArthur (Hayes' son), June Allyson, Liz Smith, Rex Reed, and Vincent Sherman stated they had witnessed some form of abusive behavior. Crawford's secretary, Jeri Binder Smith, confirmed Christina's account. Mommie Dearest became a bestseller and was made into the 1981 biographical film Mommie Dearest, starring Faye Dunaway as Crawford.|$|E

5|$|In {{order for}} the Tornado to perform well as a {{low-level}} supersonic strike aircraft, it was considered necessary for it to possess good high-speed and low-speed flight characteristics. To achieve high-speed performance, a swept or delta wing is typically adopted, but these wing designs are inefficient at low speeds. To operate at both high and low speeds with great effectiveness, the Tornado uses a variable-sweep wing. This approach had been adopted by earlier aircraft, such as the American General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark strike fighter, and the Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 fighter. The F-111 has many similarities with the smaller Tornado; however, the Tornado differs <b>in</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> multi-role aircraft with more advanced onboard systems and avionics.|$|E
5|$|Lisa hates {{her role}} as a homemaker, and realizing that her future dreams have been shattered, she loses {{interest}} <b>in</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> good student. Bart enjoys spending time with the police, and he even ends up stopping Snake during a car chase. When Principal Skinner discovers Bart's new interest in law enforcement, he enlists him as a hall monitor. Bart starts handing out demerits to his classmates for minor infractions and has order restored to the school. When Lisa secretly steals all of the Teachers' Editions of the schoolbooks and reveals the teachers' lack of education, it is up to Bart to figure out who stole the books. Realizing his sister is the culprit, Bart takes the blame and returns to his life as a bad student and detention regular, while Lisa goes back to being a good student. As Bart spents his time in detention, Lisa plays her saxophone outside his classroom to comfort him.|$|E
5|$|Literary critic Tom McCarthy {{highlighted}} what {{he perceived}} as scenes in Red Rackham's Treasure which reflected common themes in The Adventures of Tintin. He {{pointed out that}} <b>in</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> stowaway aboard the ship, Calculus {{was one of many}} stowaways in the series, and that the treasure represented the theme of jewels and precious stones which also cropped up in The Broken Ear, Tintin in the Congo, and The Castafiore Emerald. He noted Tintin's misreading of the parchments and stated this was {{one of a number of}} calculation mistakes that the character makes in the series. He suggested that a scene in which the shark submarine pushes between Haddock's buttocks was a form of sexual innuendo referencing anal sex, highlighting similar innuendo in The Broken Ear and The Crab with the Golden Claws.|$|E

5|$|Marley and Neville Livingston (later {{known as}} Bunny Wailer) had been {{childhood}} friends in Nine Mile. They {{had started to}} play music together while at Stepney Primary and Junior High School. Marley left Nine Mile with his mother when he was 12 and moved to Trenchtown, Kingston. Cedella Booker and Thadeus Livingston (Bunny Wailer's father) had a daughter together whom they named Claudette Pearl, who was a younger sister to both Bob and Bunny. Now that Marley and Livingston were living {{together in the same}} house in Trenchtown, their musical explorations deepened to include the latest R from American radio stations whose broadcasts reached Jamaica, and the new Ska music. The move to Trenchtown was proving to be fortuitous, and Marley soon found himself in a vocal group with Bunny Wailer, Peter Tosh, Beverley Kelso and Junior Braithwaite. Joe Higgs, who was part of the successful vocal act Higgs and Wilson, resided on 3rd St., and his singing partner Roy Wilson had been raised by the grandmother of Junior Braithwaite. Higgs and Wilson would rehearse {{at the back of the}} houses between 2nd and 3rd Streets, and it wasn't long before Marley (now residing on 2nd St), Junior Braithwaite and the others were congregating around this successful duo. Marley and the others didn't play any instruments at this time, and were more interested <b>in</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> vocal harmony group. Higgs was glad to help them develop their vocal harmonies, although more importantly, he had started to teach Marley how to play guitar—thereby creating the bedrock that would later allow Marley to construct some of the biggest-selling reggae songs in the history of the genre.|$|E
