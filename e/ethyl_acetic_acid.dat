30|$|During {{fermentation}} of Astragalus with L. plantarum, a {{large amount}} of organic acids are produced, including acetic acid, methylacetic acid, <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> and lactic acid. These organic acids could decrease the pH of fermented Astragalus (Qiao et al. 2018 b), which may inhibit pathogenic bacteria and maintain the balance of the intestinal microbiota. Simultaneously, {{the results of this study}} suggest increased Astragalus polysaccharides yield using L. plantarum fermentation. This may promote gut microbial fermentation of herbal carbohydrates yielding short-chain fatty acids (n-butyrate, acetate, and propionate), which are either absorbed across the gut epithelium into the circulation or utilized by enterocytes and can have numerous host beneficial effects (Xu et al. 2017). The SCFA butyrate has been shown to improve growth performance (Panda et al. 2009).|$|E
30|$|Our results {{indicate}} that FA-supplemented diets improve growth performance and serum biochemical parameters in broiler chickens, and that both UA and FA modulate the fecal microbiota of broiler chickens. This is the first study to show that unfermented and fermented Astragalus affect fecal microbiota in broiler chickens. Recent studies have reported that gut microbiota can transform herbs into metabolites, which improve the composition of gut microbiota (Xu et al. 2017). Although the effects of herbs have been investigated on gut microbial populations of chickens and humans, the exact mechanisms remain unclear. We speculate that UA and FA alter fecal microbiota diversity because of their anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties (Kim et al. 2013), which can adjust the immune balance and potentially {{reduce the need for}} antibiotics in chicken feed (Sanpha et al. 2013). Moreover, Astragalus is fermented by L. plantarum to produce large amounts of organic acids, such as lactic acid, methyl acetic acid, acetic acid, and <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetic</b> <b>acid,</b> which may be advantageous to the population of beneficial bacteria, while inhibiting the propagation of certain harmful bacteria, although further investigation is needed in this regard.|$|E

Evaluation was carried out using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-mass spectrometry (APCI-MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).

40|$|Abstract. Coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) oil is {{composed}} predominately of medium-chain triglycerides {{which have been}} reported to be beneficial to human health. It also contains free fatty acids (FFAs) which can combine with glycerol to form monoglycerides, diglycerides, and triglycerides.

The study employs silica gel F 254 as stationary phase on aluminium foil and mobile phase comprising toluene: <b>ethyl</b> acetate: <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> (2 : 8 : 0. 2). Vanillin (1 &#x 0025;) in sulphuric acid (5 &#x 0025;) in ethanolic solution gave prominent well-resolved pink colour spot for artesunate, which was stable {{for more than a}} day. The densitometric analysis was carried out in the absorbance mode at 520 nm and symmetrical, well-resolved, well-defined peaks were obtained. The R f value for artesunate was found to be 0. 44. The linear detector response for artesunate was observed between 100 - 600 ng per spot and the calibration plots showed good linear relationship with coefficient of regression, r= 0. 9989 with respect to peak area. The method was validated for precision, recovery and robustness. The limits of detection and quantitation were 30 ng/spot and 90 ng/spot, respectively. The recovery study was carried out by standard addition method and the recovery was found to be 99. 89 &#x 00 B 1; 1. 006. Recovery from tablets was 98. 88 (&#x 00 B 1; 0. 55) and from injection, it was 98. 83 (&#x 00 B 1; 0. 60) of the labeled amount...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The {{aim of this}} {{randomized}} {{clinical trial}} was to evaluate the bacterial survival rate on toothbrushes and efficacy of their decontamination by 4 % disodium <b>ethyl</b> diamine <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> [EDTA], 10 % sodium perborate and compared with control. Methods: Thirty subjects with chronic periodontitis enrolled in this randomized controlled clinical trial were provided with autoclaved toothbrushes which were free from microorganisms. Brushing instructions were given to each participant. Toothbrushes were collected from all study participants after 1 week and were placed with head down position in an autoclaved test tube containing sterile peptone water. Toothbrushes collected were sent for aerobic culture in laboratory for growth of micro-organisms. Incubation was done for 24 hours at 370 C. The toothbrushes were then divided into three groups and immersed in disinfectantslike 4 % disodium EDTA, 10 % sodium perborate and their efficacy was evaluated by aerobic culture analysis. Chi – Square test was used for statistical analysis of the data. Results: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas Aeroginosa, Streptococci and Klebsiella species were recovered from the samples. The results obtained showed that 4 % Disodium EDTA showed 100 % efficacy, whereas 10 % Sodium perborate showed 40 % effectiveness in decontaminating the toothbrushes. Distilled water as a control showed least effectiveness in cleaning toothbrushes. Conclusion: After single brushing toothbrushes get contaminated by {{a wide array of}} bacteria’...|$|R
40|$|A sensitive, selective, {{precise and}} {{stability}} indicating high performance thin layer chromatographic {{method of analysis}} of Phenobarbitone both as a bulk drug and in formulations was developed and validated in pharmaceutical dosage form. The method employed TLC aluminium plates precoated with silica gel 60 F- 254 as the stationary phase. The solvent system consisted of dichloromethane: <b>ethyl</b> acetate: glacial <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> (9. 5 : 0. 5 : 0. 1 v/v/v/v). This system was found to give compact spots for Phenobarbitone (Rf value of 0. 70). Phenobarbitone was subjected to acid and alkali hydrolysis, oxidation, photodegradation and dry heat treatment also the degraded products were well separated from the pure drug. Densitometric analysis of Phenobarbitone {{was carried out in}} the absorbance mode at 244 nm. The linear regression data for the calibration plots showed good linear relationship with r 2 =/ 0. 998 / in the concentration range of 200 -/ 600 ng/band. The method was validated for precision, accuracy, ruggedness and recovery. The limits of detection an...|$|R
