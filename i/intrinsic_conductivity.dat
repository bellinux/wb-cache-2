We study the effects of intra-band and inter-band pairing and find there is qualitatively larger change in the <b>intrinsic</b> Hall <b>conductivity</b> when there is inter-band pairing, with the change in magnitude linear in the pairing gap. We argue that inter-band pairing leads in general to higher energy costs for the topological phase compared to the topologically trivial phase and thus that the qualitative behavior of the <b>intrinsic</b> Hall <b>conductivity</b> with superconductivity in these systems could provide important clues about the nature of pairing in the superconducting phase and even some hints of whether it is topological or not.

40|$|Abstract. The {{electric}} conductivity, {{activation energy}} and morphol-ogy of polythiophene synthesized by radiofrequency resistive plas-mas are studied in this work. The continuous collisions of {{particles in the}} plasma induce the polymerization of thiophene but also break some of the monomer molecules producing complex polymers with thiophene rings and aliphatic hydrocarbon segments. These multi-directional chemical reactions are more marked at longer reaction times in which the morphology of the polymers evolved from smooth surfaces, at low exposure time, to spherical particles with diameter in the 300 - 1000 nm interval. Between both morphologies, some bubbles are formed on the surface. The <b>intrinsic</b> <b>conductivity</b> of plasma poly-mers of thiophene synthesized in this way varied {{in the range of}} 10 - 10 to 10 - 8 S/m; however, the conductivity resulted very sensitive to the water content in the polymers, which produced variations of up to 5 magnitude orders.

The results for B, N-substituted acenes are compared with those for acenes. The B-N stretching modes around 1500 cm- 1 and the low- frequency modes, less and more, respectively, strongly couple to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) {{with an increase in}} molecular size from B 3 N 3 H 6 to B 7 N 7 H 10. The relationship between the <b>intrinsic</b> intramolecular <b>conductivity</b> and the intramolecular electronic structures is investigated, and it is found that the <b>intrinsic</b> high <b>conductivity</b> needs small energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbitals and the LUMO, the high frequency modes which play an essential role in the electron-phonon interactions, and large number of atoms. The relationship between the normal and superconducting states in acenes is compared with that in B, N- substituted acenes. Both possible superconducting transition temperatures and the <b>intrinsic</b> normal <b>conductivity</b> in acenes are estimated to be larger than those in the same size of B, N- substituted acenes. These results argue against the interesting apparent paradox in conventional superconductivity; the higher resistivity at room temperature, {{the more likely it is}} that a metal will be a superconductor when cooled. That is because the frequencies of the vibrational modes which play an important role in the electron-phonon interactions in negatively charged B, N-substituted acenes are much lower than those in negatively charged acenes because of electronegativity perturbation.

40|$|Nanofluids are {{becoming}} increasingly popular as heat transfer fluids {{in a variety of}} industrial applications, due to their enhanced heat transfer characteristics. The thermal conductivity of nanofluids is usually found to be much larger than that predicted from the classical models, such as the Maxwell model. The key mechanism of enhancement of thermal conductivity of dilute nanofluids is the solvation of nanoparticles with a layer of matrix liquid. As of now, little is known quantitatively about the thermal conductivity of the interfacial layers surrounding the nanoparticles. In this article, a novel method is presented to determine the thermal conductivity of the interfacial layers of the nanoparticles. The proposed method allows the estimation of the thermal conductivity of interfacial layers based on the combined measurements of the intrinsic viscosity and <b>intrinsic</b> thermal <b>conductivity</b> of a bulk nanofluid.

40|$|Several {{series of}} nanocomposites were {{prepared}} using a latex-based process, the main step of {{which consisted of}} mixing an aqueous suspension of exfoliated carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and a polymer latex. In the present work, a systematic study on the electrical properties of fully amorphous (polystyrene - PS) as well as semi-crystalline (isotactic polypropylene - iPP) nanocomposites containing either single-wall (SWCNTs) or multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) has been conducted. Percolation thresholds as low as 0. 05 wt. % or 0. 1 wt. % were observed for SWCNT/iPP and MWCNT/iPP nanocomposites, respectively. The formation of a conductive percolating network at such a low CNT concentration is favored by the high <b>intrinsic</b> <b>conductivity</b> and the low viscosity of the polymer matrix. The electrical percolation threshold of the iPP-based system {{was found to be}} lower than its rheological percolation threshold. Beyond the percolation threshold, MWCNT-based nanocomposites generally exhibited higher conductivity levels than those based on SWCNTs, most probably due to the higher <b>intrinsic</b> <b>conductivity</b> of the MWCNTs as compared to that of the SWCNTs. These excellent electrical properties, associated with the strong nucleating effect of the CNTs reported earlier [1, 2], render this type of nanocomposites extremely attractive from a technological point of view. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

30|$|The thermal {{conductivity}} of silicone composites containing different fillers {{depends on the}} shape, size, and <b>intrinsic</b> thermal <b>conductivity</b> of fillers [30, 36, 37]. It {{can be seen from}} Fig. 3 that the {{thermal conductivity}} enhancement of silicone composites with CuNWs increases substantially with the increase of the volume fraction than that of silicone composites with GNPs and MWCNTs. The maximum is up to 215 % with 1.0  vol.% CuNW loading, much higher than that of silicone nanocomposites with the same GNPs (108 %) and MWCNTs (62 %) loading. When the volume fraction of fillers is less than 0.5 %, the shape, size, and <b>intrinsic</b> thermal <b>conductivity</b> of fillers do not obviously affect the thermal conductivity of silicone composites. This is because the heat-conductive fillers surrounded by silicone base cannot touch each other at low filler loading; hence, the thermal conductivity increases very slowly resulting from high thermal contact resistance inside the composites [30, 36]. While with the loading further increasing, the thermal conductivity of silicone composites with different fillers differs greatly, which indicates that the shape, size, and <b>intrinsic</b> thermal <b>conductivity</b> of fillers have a significant influence on the thermal conductivity improvement of silicone composites. Many studies have reported that the GNPs with superior thermal conductivity and large aspect ratio could greatly improve the thermal conductivity of polymer composites with only a few GNPs [37 – 39]. And it has stronger ability to enhance the thermal conductivity of polymer composites than MWCNTs [40, 41]. This phenomenon has also been observed in our study. Although the <b>intrinsic</b> thermal <b>conductivity</b> of CuNWs (398  W/mK) is far less than that of GNPs (1000  W/mK) and MWCNTs (3000  W/mK) (as shown in Table 1), the ability of ultra-long CuNWs to enhance the thermal conductivity of silicone composites is stronger than that of GNPs and MWCNTs. It is due to the ultra-long CuNWs with a length of more than 100  μm. The characteristic of CuNWs is hard and linear, which is nothing like MWCNTs (smooth and frizzy). The effective aspect ratio (350) of CuNWs from the Nielsen model is in the range of morphology from SEM and TEM images, which showed the advantage of ultra-long filler on heat transfer. But perhaps because MWCNTs has frizzy and twining structure, the effective aspect ratio (100) from the model is less than that from SEM and TEM. The ultra-long and linear structure facilitates the formation of bridges between themselves and thus to construct some effective thermal conductive networks. These networks provide a low-resistance pathway to heat conduction and increase the overall thermal conductivity of the composite.|$|R
