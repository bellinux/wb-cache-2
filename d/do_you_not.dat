25|$|In 1894, Boyce {{was elected}} to the Idaho state senate as a Populist from Shoshone County, Idaho. Boyce battled for the eight-hour day for miners, the {{establishment}} of an arbitration board to settle labor disputes, and an investigation of the 1892 mining war. He objected to appropriations for the state militia, charging that it was a tool used by the state and mine owners to suppress labor. He called for legislation to forbid employment of aliens, to outlaw yellow-dog contracts and prohibit company stores. In {{one of the most dramatic}} speeches he ever made, Boyce denounced the blacklist:Senate bill fifty six provides for no class, no special legislation, but under its provisions those relentless persecutors, known as corporations, are prevented when they discharge an employee from following him with a blacklist and depriving him of the means of earning an honest living in another part of the state….Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> produce some argument against it to show that it should not become a law? No, it is not necessary: you of the Republican party have the votes to kill the bill and that is all you desire. But remember these words: the laboring men of Idaho have asked you for bread and you give them a stone: we ask you for justice and you treat us with scorn, but the day is fast approaching when your action will be condemned by every man who has one drop of manly blood in his veins.|$|E

In a scene inside Flanders' kitchen, a note which reads [...] "1 COR 6:9-11" [...] can be seen. This refers to the Bible, First Corinthian, chapter 6, verses 9 to 11: [...] "Or <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God." [...] The cups in the 33 cent store read That '70s Show, a reference which Danny Masterson, one of the lead actors in That '70s Show, was entertained by, according to Scully. Battling Seizure Robots, the seizure-inducing television show that the Simpsons watch in their hotel room, is based on an episode of Pokémon, called [...] "Dennō Senshi Porygon", which caused 685 children to develop epileptic seizures. According to Scully, the staff received [...] "several angry letters" [...] from people for the scene. After the cartoon, an advertisement for Mr. Sparkle, a character that first appeared in the season 8 episode [...] "In Marge We Trust", can be seen on the television screen. Barney, while impersonating Homer, says [...] "That boy ain't right", a line frequently used by Hank Hill, the main character of the animated television series King of the Hill. The giant monsters attacking at the end of the episode are Godzilla, Gamera, Rodan and Mothra, all of which are famous from Japanese monster movies. The scene was included as a reference to the 1998 action science fiction film Godzilla, in which three of the main The Simpsons cast members (Azaria, Cartwright and Shearer) had a live-action role.|$|E

When she and her companion presented themselves at the council room, the French official refused them tickets of admission. “But, madam, you are a woman,” he said in explanation. “Yes, and in monsieur, I expect to find a gentleman,” she answered. The official went on to explain that a woman had never sat at such a gathering, and that it was impossible for him to allow her to enter. With characteristic persistency, Sullivan stuck to her point. she said,” <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> think that Paris should establish a precedent?” She and her companion were given tickets of admission.

2500|$|Many {{conservative}} denominations of Abrahamic {{and other}} religions consider homosexual acts to be inherently sinful based on scripture (e.g., Leviticus 18:22 [...] "Do not {{have sexual relations}} with a man as one does with a woman; that is detestable," [...] and Leviticus 20:13 [...] "If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable.

Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor those who practice homosexuality...will inherit the kingdom of God.") Many Christian denominations and a number of Christian fundamentalists (e.g., Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell) cite Biblical texts to advocate that same-sex sexual intercourse is sinful. These individuals and congregations believe that such sexual acts as anal and oral sex (along with fornication of any kind) are forms of sexual immorality that should be advised against. One slogan is the commonly used phrase [...] "love the sinner and not the sin." [...] These churches tend to speak out against violence and hate towards those who are attracted to the same gender.

2500|$|William Blake, a Romantic {{poet and}} artist, thought that Wordsworth {{was at the}} same level as the poets Dante, Shakespeare, and Milton. In a diary entry for 27 December 1825, H. C. Robinson recounted a {{conversation}} between himself and William Blake shortly before Blake's death: [...] "I read to him Wordsworth's incomparable ode, which he heartily enjoyed. But he repeated, 'I fear Wordsworth loves nature, and nature is the work of the Devil. The Devil is in us as 'far as we are nature.'... The parts of Wordsworth's ode which Blake most enjoyed were the most obscure—at all events, those which I least like and comprehend." [...] Following Blake, Chauncy Hare Townshend produced [...] "An Essay on the Theory and the Writings of Wordsworth"for Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine in 1829. In the third part, he critiqued Wordsworth's use of pre-existence within the poem and asked [...] "unless our author means to say that, having existed from all eternity, we are of an eternal and indestructible essence; or, in other words, that being incarnate portion of the Deity... we are as Immortal as himself. But if the poet intends to affirm this, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> perceive that he frustrates his own aim?" [...] He continued by explaining why he felt that Wordsworth's concept fell short of any useful purpose: [...] "For if we are of God's indivisible essence, and receive our separate consciousness from the wall of flesh which, at our birth, was raised between us and the Found of Being, we must, on the dissolution of the body... be again merged in the simple and uncompounded Godhead, lose our individual consciousness... in another sense, become as though we had never been." [...] He concluded his analysis with a critique of the poem as a whole: [...] "I should say that Wordsworth does not display in it any great clearness of thought, or felicity of language... the ode in question is not so much abstruse in idea as crabbed in expression. There appears to be a laborious toiling after originality, ending in a dismal want of harmony." ...|$|E

Her forgiveness certainly cannot justify me eternally, {{no more than a}} person’s implacability can harm anyone but himself, but her forgiveness is a part of a divine procedure. Why, then, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> have it? Because I could not make myself understandable to her. ... Suppose she had forgiven me. Then, of course, she would not have forgotten me.
