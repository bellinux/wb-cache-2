5|$|In {{her first}} World Cup {{races in the}} 2005–06 season, Neuner {{achieved}} average course times; her best result was being fourth <b>fastest</b> in the pursuit race in Kontiolahti. During her first full season in 2006–07, she finished among the top three <b>fastest</b> skiers in 19 of her 24 races and came in <b>fastest</b> in seven of them. Neuner won the 2007–08 Biathlon World Cup with dominating skiing performances. She set the <b>fastest</b> course time in 19 of her 25 races and was second or third <b>fastest</b> in the remaining six. At {{the beginning of the}} 2008–09 season, Neuner had a substantial drop in her skiing times due to a series of illnesses. However, she recovered and set the <b>fastest</b> course time in 14 of the remaining 18 races from January onwards. In the 2009–10 Olympic season, Neuner again started slowly in December, but came back finishing among the top three <b>fastest</b> skiers in 17 of her 21 races. She had her second best winter in 2010–11 when she set the <b>fastest</b> or second <b>fastest</b> skiing time in 90% of her 21 races.|$|E
5|$|The Saturday morning {{sessions}} {{were held in}} dry conditions and later on a wet track, were grip was poor and some drivers were forced onto the grass after sliding off the track. Häkkinen was <b>fastest</b> in the third practice session, {{with a time of}} 1:11.355; Coulthard had the second <b>fastest</b> time. The two Ferrari drivers were third and fourth; Barrichello ahead of Michael Schumacher. Verstappen continued his quick form and set the fifth <b>fastest</b> time, ahead of Fisichella and Villeneuve. Zonta, Trulli and Herbert rounded out the top ten <b>fastest</b> drivers in the session. In the final practice session, Häkkinen again set the <b>fastest</b> time, a 1:11.336, despite spinning into the gravel late in the session; his teammate Coulthard remained second quickest. Michael Schumacher was third <b>fastest</b> ahead of teammate Barrichello. Villeneuve was fifth <b>fastest,</b> ahead of Herbert and Frentzen. Salo, Fisichella and Arrows driver Pedro de la Rosa completed the top ten ahead of qualifying.|$|E

5|$|Dennis's lack {{of concern}} was vindicated on Saturday, with Hamilton setting the <b>fastest</b> time in {{practice}} with a lap of 1:34.811. Massa finished the session {{a tenth of a}} second behind, with third placed Alonso a further half second behind. Kubica, Räikkönen, Rosberg and Heidfeld followed, with Super Aguri driver Anthony Davidson eighth <b>fastest.</b> Super Aguri are regarded as a sister team to the Honda F1 works team, who set only the 17th and 19th <b>fastest</b> times. The 2007 Super Aguri is widely thought to be an updated version of Honda's 2006 car.|$|E

He won his first indoor NCAA title in the 200m and was runner-up in the 60m, having set a {{personal}} best of 6.59seconds in the heats. His time of 20.27seconds in the 200m final was the <b>fastest</b> indoor run {{in the world that}} year.

He completed a 200m NCAA Championship double by taking the outdoor title, and he also finished as runner-up in the 100m, second to Xavier Carter.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fasting</b> is stricter {{than in the}} Roman rite.

5|$|Due to {{the rain}} that had fallen, the drivers went out on track on {{intermediate}} tyres {{at the beginning of}} Q3. On these tyres, Hamilton set the <b>fastest</b> time, followed by Button and Ricciardo. The track dried quickly however, and soon the cars returned to the pit lane to switch to slick tyres. Hülkenberg twice set the <b>fastest</b> time, but was beaten to pole position by Hamilton. Rosberg went faster as well, but lost his second place on the grid to Hülkenberg due to his five-place grid penalty. Vettel went fourth <b>fastest,</b> but was relegated as well, handing third on the grid to Button, who had set the fifth <b>fastest</b> time. Räikkönen, Ricciardo, Valtteri Bottas, Verstappen and Felipe Massa rounded up the top ten. It was Hülkenberg's second front row start of his career, the first having been his pole position at the 2010 Brazilian Grand Prix.|$|E

5000|$|Both Jainism and Islam place {{value on}} ritual <b>fasting.</b> The ascetic {{practices}} and festive occasions in Jainism involve <b>fasting.</b> In Islam, Sawm (Muslim <b>Fasting</b> for Ramadan) is a month long mandatory ritual <b>fasting</b> by Muslims.

In Jain <b>fasting</b> <b>fasting</b> continues during day and night, and Jains break their <b>fast</b> 48 minutes after the sunrise {{of the day when}} <b>fast</b> ends. Another difference is that Jain practice is optional and set by the preferences of the Jain any time of the year.

5|$|Four {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race, two each on Friday and Saturday.

Conditions were dry for the Friday {{practice sessions}}. Barrichello set the first session's <b>fastest</b> time, at 1 minute and 13.603 seconds, two-tenths of a second quicker than Jarno Trulli. Ricardo Zonta finished with the third <b>fastest</b> time. Verstappen, Michael Schumacher and Coulthard filled in the next three positions. Fisichella, Johnny Herbert, Jacques Villeneuve and Mika Salo rounded out the top ten positions. Häkkinen's car was afflicted with a mechanical fuel pump issue; this restricted him to one out lap and he was slowest overall. In the second practice session, Coulthard set the <b>fastest</b> lap of the day, a 1:12.464; Häkkinen had a trouble free season and ended with the second <b>fastest</b> time. Salo ran quicker during the session and was third <b>fastest.</b> Michael Schumacher and Barrichello had the fourth and seventh <b>fastest</b> times respectively; they were separated by Zonta and Trulli. Villeneuve, Diniz and Fisichella completed the top ten positions. After the second session, Irvine, who had only participated in the first practice session, withdrew from the Grand Prix.

25|$|In halakha, {{there are}} two general types of fast: the {{communal}} <b>fast</b> and the individuals' <b>fast.</b> Among other differences between the two, a special prayer is added by the Chazzan (leader of the prayers) on communal <b>fasts</b> whenever both ten <b>fasting</b> individuals congregate and the Chazzan is <b>fasting.</b> While the Magen Avraham treats the <b>fast</b> as an individuals' <b>fast,</b> the Shiyurei K'nesset Ha-G'dolah, the P'ri Chadash, and the Or Zaru'a {{view it as a}} communal <b>fast.</b> To avoid the practical implications of the controversy, the Mishnah Berurah suggests that a firstborn should not serve as Chazzan {{on the day of the}} <b>fast.</b>|$|R
25|$|It {{is also to}} {{be noted}} that fish is {{permissible}} during the Advent <b>fast,</b> the Apostles' <b>Fast,</b> and the <b>fast</b> of the Virgin Mary except on Wednesdays and Fridays of these <b>fasts.</b> Lent and the Holy Week <b>fasts</b> are stricter than the other <b>fasts</b> in their discipline.
