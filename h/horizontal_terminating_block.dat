50|$|Modern 110 blocks largely supplanted 66 {{blocks for}} new {{commercial}} installations {{at the end}} of the 20th century, as the capability for a circuit to carry digital data overlaid its ability to carry analog voice conversations. 110 block termination is almost always Category 5 (or higher) compliant, and capable of supporting 100 MHz (or faster) signaling. Compared to 110 and higher-density wire <b>terminating</b> <b>blocks,</b> 66 blocks are physically large; and because of their maximum 16 MHz Category 3 signaling compatibility, they are ill-suited for high speed (faster than 10BASE-T) data circuits. However, special Category 5e Certified 66 blocks are available from manufacturers such as Siemon which meet all standards for Cat5e termination.|$|R

40|$|Polyurethanes {{based on}} a 50 / 50 copoly(L-lactide/epsilon-caprolactone) {{prepolymer}} and butanediisocyanate were made. Chain extending a diisocyanate terminated prepolymer with butanediamine was not possible due to the susceptibility of the lactide bond to aminolysis. Chain extension with butanediol resulted in a polymer with poor mechanical properties due to transesterification. When the copolymer prepolymer was chain-extended with an isocyanate <b>terminated</b> <b>block,</b> transesterification with the chain-extender was avoided and the mechanical properties were increased. When {{the length of the}} hard segments was increased the mechanical properties increased further. A L-lactide/epsilon-caprolactone based polyurethane with a tensile strength and modulus of respectively 45 MPa and 60 MPa was made. The polymer contained no poly(L-lactide) crystals and was easy to process. Compared to the high molecular weight 50 / 50 copoly(L-lactide/epsilon-caprolactone) the polyurethane showed better mechanical properties, is expected to have the same adhesive properties and is expected to have a slower degradation rate. These factors makes this polymer excessively useful for in-vivo tissue engineering in for instance meniscal reconstruction material, nerve guide and artificial skin...|$|R

Operators were encouraged to wear heavy boots with steel toes and be quick at removing one.

As with the Linotype / Intertype machines, the Ludlow machines were often fitted with metal feeders to keep the pot filled to optimum level.|$|R

5|$|Architectural styles evolve {{and change}} {{to suit the}} {{requirements}} of each individual client. When in 1746 the Duke of Bedford decided to rebuild Woburn Abbey, he chose the Palladian style for the design, as this was now the most fashionable of the era. He selected architect Henry Flitcroft, a protege of Burlington. Flitcroft's designs, while Palladian in nature, would not be recognised by Palladio himself. The central block is small, only three bays, the temple-like portico is merely suggested, and it is closed. Two great flanking wings containing a vast suite of state rooms replace the walls or colonnades which should have connected to the farm buildings; the farm buildings terminating the structure are elevated in height to match the central block, and given Palladian windows, to ensure they are seen as of Palladian design. This development of the style was to be repeated in countless houses, and town halls in Britain over one hundred years. Falling from favour during the Victorian era, it was revived by Sir Aston Webb for his refacing of Buckingham Palace in 1913. Often the <b>terminating</b> <b>blocks</b> would have blind porticos and pilasters themselves, competing for attention with, or complementing the central block. This was all very {{far removed from the}} designs of Palladio two hundred years earlier.|$|R

40|$|The brittle {{fracture}} of the Hoan Bridge in December 2000 highlighted the fracture susceptibility of details containing intersecting welds in steel bridges. Though {{it is now}} known that details with intersecting welds should be avoided, many existing bridges in Indiana contain details with intersecting welds. Little experimental data on the fatigue performance of these details exists. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the fatigue strength of several details commonly found in steel bridges in Indiana that contain intersecting welds. Large-scale experimental fatigue testing were performed using nine steel beams to study the behavior of three basic types of welded details: a vertical stiffener, a <b>horizontal</b> stiffener <b>terminating</b> near a vertical stiffener, and a horizontal gusset plate coped to fit around a vertical stiffener. The welded details in this study were fabricated with varying degrees of web gap, defined as the distance between perpendicular weld toes. The results of the experimental testing were examined and compared to prior testing to determine if the size of the web gap affected the fatigue strength. Furthermore, the performance of drilled hole retrofits used to extend the fatigue life of these details was studied. Within the scope of the fatigue testing program, the presence of intersecting welds was not found to significantly affect the fatigue strength of vertical stiffener and horizontal gusset details. However, the size of the web gap may have had an effect on the fatigue strength of details where a <b>horizontal</b> stiffener <b>terminated</b> near a vertical stiffener. Further experimental testing is needed to more clearly define the relationship between web gap and fatigue strength for this case. Drilled hole retrofits were successful at prolonging the lives of these details to varying degrees, but it should be noted that the stress redistribution resulting from these holes may cause fatigue cracking at nearby weld toes...|$|R

5000|$|Apart {{from the}} need to match Helvetica, the letter shapes of Arial are also {{strongly}} influenced by Monotype's own Monotype Grotesque designs, released in or by the 1920s, with additional influence from 'New Grotesque', an abortive redesign from 1956. The designs of the R, G and r also resemble Gill Sans. The changes cause the typeface to nearly match Linotype Helvetica in both proportion and weight (see figure), and perfectly match in width. Monotype executive Allan Haley observed, [...] "Arial was drawn more rounded than Helvetica, the curves softer and fuller and the counters more open.

40|$|Negotiations, a {{model of}} {{concurrency}} with multi party negotiation as primitive, have been recently introduced by J. Desel and J. Esparza. We initiate the study of games for this model.

We show that for arbitrary negotiations the problems are EXPTIME-complete. Then we show that for sound and deterministic or even weakly deterministic negotiations the problems can be solved in PTIME.
