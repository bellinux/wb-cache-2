5|$|Whether it {{involved}} {{the history of}} the number zero or the invention of the transistor, two things stood out to me. First is that the discovery {{that turns out to be}} the most valuable is usually dismissed as a side-effect. Second is that prototypes almost never include neon lights and chrome. I wanted to see a story play out that was more in line with the way real innovation takes place than I <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> film before.|$|E
5|$|The new {{station was}} {{constructed}} in an Art Deco/Streamline Moderne design by Charles Holden with L H Bucknell. Like Holden's other designs for London Underground in the 1930s, East Finchley station was inspired by European architecture (particularly Dutch) that Holden <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> trips to the continent during that decade. The track here runs roughly north-west to south-east. The imposing station building, built on rising ground adjacent to the railway bridge over High Road (A1000), has three entrances. The two main entrances to the ticket hall are {{on the north side}} of the tracks facing High Road and the third, minor entrance, is on the south side. The entrances are linked by a passage under the tracks which provides access up to the platforms.|$|E

5|$|Wilfrid built {{a church}} capable of {{accommodating}} a congregation of 2,000 at Hexham, using stone from Hadrian's Wall. The 12th-century writer Ailred of Rievaulx, whose family helped restore Hexham, credited Wilfrid as the designer {{of a church}} beautifully embellished with paintings and sculpture. It appears that the churches at Hexham and Ripon (which Wilfrid also built) were aisled basilicas, of the type that was common on the continent. Ripon was the first church in Northumbria to incorporate a porticus, {{similar to those of}} churches in Kent. 12th-century pilgrims' accounts declared that the church at Hexham rivalled those of Rome. The crypts at both Ripon and Hexham are unusual, and perhaps were intended by Wilfrid to mimic the Roman catacombs which he <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> his travels. They are still extant, although the fabric of Wilfrid's churches above ground has been replaced by later structures. The churches were finished with glazed windows, made by glassmakers brought over from the continent.|$|E

25|$|In 1852 {{the family}} moved to Owego, New York where there were better {{educational}} facilities. Here they lived by the Susquehanna River. The boys James and Henry built a boat and rigged it up like the side wheelers they <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> the Hudson River. This they used to take people up the river on excursions and also to carry produce down the river, thus earning money with which to pay their father for the material used to build the boat.|$|E
25|$|While {{civilian}} communities {{had organized}} {{ways to deal}} with the care and transportation of the sick and dying {{as far back as the}} bubonic plague in London between 1598 and 1665, such arrangements were typically ad hoc and temporary. In time, however, these arrangements began to formalize and become permanent. During the American Civil War, Jonathan Letterman devised a system of mobile field hospitals employing the first uses of the principles of triage. After returning home, some veterans began to attempt to apply what had they <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> the battlefield to their own communities, and commenced the creation of volunteer life-saving squads and ambulance corps.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 15th century a {{competition}} {{was held in}} Florence for a plan to roof the central crossing of the huge, unfinished Gothic Cathedral. It was won by the artist Brunelleschi who, inspired by domes that he <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> his travels, {{such as that of}} San Vitale in Ravenna and the enormous dome of the Roman period which roofed the Pantheon, designed a huge dome which is regarded as the first building of the Renaissance period. Its style, visually however, is ribbed and pointed and purely Gothic. It was Renaissance (a rebirth) in its audacity {{and the fact that it}} looked back to Roman structural techniques.|$|E

25|$|In August 1796, both Canada and Nova Scotia were {{stirred by}} the news that Admiral Richery had escaped the {{vigilance}} of Admiral Robert Mann out of Cadiz, and was proceeding to Newfoundland with seven sail {{of the line and}} several frigates. Against this force Vice-Admiral Wallace at St. John's could only oppose the old Romney of 50 guns, two 32's and two 16's. Captain Taylor, in Andromeda, of thirty-two guns, had parted for the banks with orders to cruise there {{for the protection of the}} sea trade. On 3 September he spoke with a schooner, the master of which informed him that he <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> the coast an enemy's fleet, consisting of several ships of the line and frigates. Subsequent reports increased alarm on the mainland by telling of French landings in Conception Bay.|$|E
25|$|Weir and Jerman {{suggested}} that the sheela na gigs served to warn against lust. They see the figures as a religious warning against sins of the flesh. Exhibitionist figures of all types—male, female, and bestial—are frequently found {{in the company of}} images of beasts devouring people and other hellish images. These images, they argue, were used as a means of religious instruction to a largely illiterate populace. As part of this interpretation, they explore a continental origin for the figures. Andersen first suggested this origin, and Weir and Jerman continued and expanded this line of inquiry. They argue that the motif migrated from the continent via the pilgrim routes to and from Santiago de Compostella. (Freitag argues against this.) Pilgrim sculptors took notes of what they <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> the route and ended up carving their own interpretations of the motifs. Eventually, the exhibitionist motif was carried to Ireland and Britain. This theory seems to accommodate many of the religious figures but relates less well to some of the secular ones. Images carved on castles would not seem to be serving a religious purpose. The figure at Haddon Hall appears on a stable (although this may have been moved from elsewhere). The theory does not cover all the figures.|$|E

500|$|Nielsen's cantata Hymnus amoris for soloists, chorus and {{orchestra}} was first performed at Copenhagen's Musikforeningen (The Music Society) on 27 April 1897.

Some of the extras on set actually became terrified of the actor because of his violent portrayal.

500|$|There are {{literary}} {{precursors for}} Scrooge in Dickens's own works. Peter Ackroyd, Dickens's biographer, sees similarities between Scrooge and the elder Martin Chuzzlewit character, although the miser is [...] "a more fantastic image" [...] than the Chuzzlewit patriarch; Ackroyd observes that Chuzzlewit's transformation to a charitable figure is a parallel {{to that of}} the miser. Douglas-Fairhurst sees that the minor character Gabriel Grub from The Pickwick Papers was also an influence when creating Scrooge. Scrooge's name came from a tombstone Dickens <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> a visit to Edinburgh. The grave was for Ebenezer Lennox Scroggie, whose job was given as a meal man—a corn merchant; Dickens misread the inscription as [...] "mean man".|$|E
500|$|When Dickens {{was young}} he lived near a tradesman's {{premises}} with the sign [...] "Goodge and Marney", {{which may have}} provided the name for Scrooge's former business partner. For the chained Marley, Dickens had remembered a visit he had made to the Western Penitentiary in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in March 1842, where he saw—and was affected by—seeing fettered prisoners. For the character Tiny Tim, Dickens used his nephew Henry, a disabled boy who was five at the time A Christmas Carol was written. The two figures of Want and Ignorance, sheltering in the robes of the Ghost of Christmas Present were inspired by the children Dickens <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> his visit to a ragged School in the East End of London.|$|E
