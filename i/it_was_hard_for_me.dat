500|$|Apple Records issued [...] "Try Some, Buy Some" [...] on 16 April 1971 in Britain (as Apple 33), {{and three}} days later in America (as Apple 1832). Apple's print {{advertisement}} for the release carried the simple tagline: [...] "A New Single". Among the interviews she gave to the UK music press, Ronnie Spector admitted to Symes that {{it took a long}} time to learn the song [...] "as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to understand", but she added: [...] "I love the record. It's completely different for me; it's more of a music thing than vocal." [...] In America, Billboard magazine's reviewer described [...] "Try Some, Buy Some" [...] as a [...] "powerful production ballad" [...] that had [...] "all the ingredients to break through big", while suggesting that Ringo Starr and Eric Clapton had contributed to the recording.|$|E
500|$|Before he {{shot his}} own head-smashing scene, {{he spoke to}} Gaspar Noé and {{asked him how he}} had done a similar scene in his film Irréversible (2002). Crossing the line from romance to violence, the scene begins with the Driver and Irene kissing tenderly. What they share is really a goodbye kiss, as he then becomes a [...] "werewolf," [...] violently stomping the hit man's head in. Subsequently, Irene sees the Driver in a new light. Of this scene Refn said: Every movie has to have a hearta place where it defines itselfand in every movie I've made there's always a scene that does that. On Drive, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to wrap my head around it. I {{realized}} I needed to show in one situation that driver is the hopelessly romantic knight, but he's also completely psychotic and is willing to use any kind of violence to protect innocence. But that scene was never written. As I was going along, it just kind of popped up. In March 2012, Interiors, an online journal that is concerned with the relationship between architecture and film, released an issue that discussed how space is used in this scene. The issue highlights Refn's use of constricted space and his way of creating a balance between romance and violence.|$|E

2500|$|When {{she heard}} that Danes was no longer keen to {{continue}} with the show, Holzman's attitude changed as well. She said, [...] "When I realized that Claire truly did not want to do it any more, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to want to do it. The joy in writing the show was that everyone was behind it and wanted to do it. And I love her. So part of the joy and excitement and happiness would have gone out of me if she had not been on board 100 percent. I wasn't able to say this at the time, but in retrospect it was a blessing for it to end {{at a time when we}} all enjoyed doing it. That's not to say that if the network had ordered more shows that I wouldn't have given it my best. But there was a rightness in how short the season was. This was a show about adolescence and sort of ended in its own adolescence. There was an aura about how short the series was like all things that die young. The show ended at a point that it was still all potential." ...|$|E
2500|$|A mid-tempo heartbreak song, {{the lyrics}} of [...] "The Root" [...] have the narrator lamenting a lost lover; [...] "In the name of love and hope she took my shield and sword ... From the pit of the bottom that knows no floor/Like the rain to the dirt, from the vine to the wine/From the alpha of creation, {{to the end of}} all time". The final two minutes of [...] "The Root" [...] feature an {{emphatic}} refrain of the chorus line. Reveille Magazine's Steve McPherson wrote that the chorus [...] "feeds back into itself over and over again, turning from a hook into a mantra into a gospel affirmation". In the promotional EPK for Voodoo, D'Angelo discussed the therapeutic nature of recording [...] "The Root", stating [...] "It was kinda therapeutic for me to do this song. It kinda help me get over, because I'm so pathetic in the song. You know what I mean? That's what 'The Root' is. She got it on me. And I'm just fucked up. It was good for me to get over that. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> sometimes to do that song. To record it, because when doing it I would have to put myself in that mode you know".|$|E
2500|$|Nina was {{a singing}} {{champion}} on Tanghalan ng Kampeon, with her winning pieces [...] "Better Days" [...] and [...] "Love Takes Time". She expressed {{having so much}} sacrifices for her singing career, stating [...] "I always order Halo-halo without ice. If I want to eat ice cream, I have to let it melt first or else microwave it. I also don’t eat spicy food or mint candies." [...] She explained, [...] "Of course, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> [...] But {{you get used to}} it." [...] She also sings twenty songs a day for practice. She takes good care of her voice and maintains a healthy diet, and swore it takes her only three days or less to recover from throat infections. In her 2011 documentary on TvN Asia, it was revealed that despite all the fame and success, Nina still regularly comes back to the Center for Pop Music to train her vocals and make it even stronger. She is also known for doing covers of popular hits. She expressed herself in a statement, saying [...] "I can say that the songs I sing in my albums very much represent who I am [...] I try to make it my own even if it was done originally by another artist." ...|$|E

2500|$|Spanbauer {{moved to}} New York City in 1983 {{and entered the}} Columbia University Writing Program. Spanbauer {{took a job as}} an {{apartment}} building supervisor in the East Village, and began abusing alcohol and taking cocaine. He began writing The Man Who Fell in Love with the Moon in 1987, and by 1988 was deep into the manuscript. [...] The writing process was a very difficult one for Spanbauer. [...] He had so little money that he lived like [...] "a subway rat, pale and frail, trying hard to believe in" [...] the novel he was writing. He later said, [...] "A lot of the stuff I came up with was pretty fearsome, facing some personal devils head-on. I couldn't distinguish between the world and the book. At one point, I was so stressed out, I passed out in Penn Station." [...] As he told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer after the book's publication, [...] "It's all a matter of trust. You're {{right in the middle of}} this story. [...] You don't know the end of it. It's this preposterous tale about these preposterous people, and you don't know what's going to happen next, and you're tired of eating chicken livers and fettuccine, and you're alone in this little square concrete apartment, there's no air or earth, and pretty soon <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to distinguish what was going on in my head and what was going on on the outside." [...] The book took four and a half years and seven revisions to complete.|$|E

I must assume that he found in me something quite as alien--perhaps more so, for my life in Boston and New York had given to me habits of speech and of thought which obscured, no doubt, most of my youthful characteristics.|$|E

60|$|Wild as it was, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> {{to get rid}} of the {{associations}} of the settlements. Any steady and monotonous sound, to which I did not distinctly attend, passed for a sound of human industry. The waterfalls which I heard were not without their dams and mills to my imagination; and several times I found that I had been regarding the steady rushing sound of the wind from over the woods beyond the rivers as that of a train of cars. Our minds anywhere, when left to themselves, are always thus busily drawing conclusions from false premises.|$|E
60|$|Perhaps it {{was this}} same year {{that one of the}} men {{discovered}} another enormous yellow-back in the barnyard, one of the largest ever seen on the farm--and killed it just as it was moving across an old barrel. I cannot now understand why it tried to cross the barrel, but I distinctly visualize the brown and yellow band it made as it lay for an instant just before the bludgeon fell upon it, crushing it and the barrel together. He was thicker than my leg and glistened in the sun with sinister splendor. As he hung limp over the fence, a warning to his fellows, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to realize that death still lay in his square jaws and poisonous fangs.|$|E

I was sure that Lord Avon could not and would not expose him. I knew your sense of family pride too well, my lord, and I was certain that his secret was safe in your hands. But I both could and would; and then, when his life had been blasted, {{and he had been}} hounded from his regiment and from his clubs, it would be time, perhaps, for me to deal in some other way with him." ...|$|E
