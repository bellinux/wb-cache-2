In Pskov-Hansa trade most often were used thalers minted in Lübeck. Until the 17th century exchange thaler rate was 1:36 (36 kopeks for 1 thaler). In {{the first half of the}} 17th century one thaler was equal to 100 denga (1/2 ruble).Golden European coins were rarely used in trade in Baltics. These rare coins were mostly 3.4 <b>grams</b> <b>golden</b> ducatss minted in Hungary. Large part of trade operations were conducted using credit system, but in the absence of bank loans merchants gave their counterparty promissory notes which then were the basis for the right to demand repayment.|$|R

Golden Goldies was a project put together by Insane Clown Posse for entertainment purposes only. To add more humor to the album, each artist was given only five minutes to write their verses, and had only one take to record them, which resulted in some artists messing up their lines, and lyrics containing [...] "some very strange things." [...] The group held only one live performance, which occurred at the record release party for Insane Clown Posse's Riddle Box.|$|E
