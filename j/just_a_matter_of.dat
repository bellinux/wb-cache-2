5|$|The {{concept of}} the {{wristwatch}} {{goes back to the}} production of the very earliest watches in the 16th century. Elizabeth I of England received a wristwatch from Robert Dudley in 1571, described as an arm watch. From the beginning, wrist watches were almost exclusively worn by women, while men used pocket-watches up until the early 20th century. This was not <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> fashion or prejudice; watches of the time were notoriously prone to fouling from exposure to the elements, and could only reliably be kept safe from harm if carried securely in the pocket. When the waistcoat was introduced as a manly fashion at the court of Charles II in the 17th century, the pocket watch was tucked into its pocket. Prince Albert, the consort to Queen Victoria, introduced the 'Albert chain' accessory, designed to secure the pocket watch to the man's outergarment by way of a clip. By the mid nineteenth century, most watchmakers produced a range of wristwatches, often marketed as bracelets, for women.|$|E

Equally important were other commercial advantages the Dutch had over their competitors, like fundamentally lower interest rates, and the productivity and profitably of the Dutch textile industry (due to technological innovations).

25|$|In the 1980s, Los Muñequitos de Matanzas greatly {{expanded}} the melodic {{parameters of the}} drums, inspiring a wave of creativity that ultimately led to the modernization of rumba drumming. Freed from {{the confines of the}} traditional drum melodies, rumba became more an aesthetic, rather than a specific combination of individual parts. The most significant innovation of the late 1980s was the rumba known as guarapachangueo, created by Los Chinitos of Havana, and batá-rumba, created by AfroCuba de Matanzas. Batá-rumba initially was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> combining guaguancó and chachalokuafún, but it has since expanded to include a variety of batá rhythms.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} argued by some physicists, e.g., M. J. Duff, that {{the laws of physics}} are {{inherently}} dimensionless. The fact that we have assigned incompatible dimensions to Length, Time and Mass is, according to this point of view, <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> convention, borne out of the fact that before the advent of modern physics, {{there was no way to}} relate mass, length, and time to each other.

25|$|The {{timing of}} the ride {{is to try to}} take {{advantage}} of generally favourable weather at the start of summer in Victoria, with warm days, mild nights, relatively little rainfall and less wind than at other times of year. Despite expected mild conditions, severe weather can nonetheless be common, ranging from temperatures in excess of , heavy rainfall and thunderstorms, and cold windy conditions. For example, the 2012 ride saw seventeen riders hospitalised with fears of hypothermia due to the wet and cold on day four, while <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> days both before and after this many riders struggled with the heat when temperatures reached the high-30s.|$|E
25|$|As thermal {{radiation}} travels, more or less, {{in a straight}} line from the fireball (unless scattered) any opaque object will produce a protective shadow that provides protection from the flash burn. Depending on the properties of the underlying surface material, the exposed area outside the protective shadow will be either burnt to a darker color, such as charring wood, or a brighter color, such as asphalt. If such a weather phenomenon as fog or haze is present at the point of the nuclear explosion, it scatters the flash, with radiant energy then reaching burn sensitive substances from all directions. Under these conditions, opaque objects are therefore less effective than they would otherwise be without scattering, as they demonstrate maximum shadowing effect in an environment of perfect visibility and therefore zero scattering. Similar to a foggy or overcast day, although there are few, if any, shadows produced by the sun on such a day, the solar energy that reaches the ground from the sun's infrared rays is nevertheless considerably diminished, due to it being absorbed by the water of the clouds and the energy also being scattered back into space. Analogously, so too is the intensity at range of burning flash energy attenuated, in units of J/cm2, along the slant/horizontal range of a nuclear explosion, during fog or haze conditions. So despite any object that casts a shadow being rendered ineffective as a shield from the flash by fog or haze, due to scattering, the fog fills the same protective role, but generally only at the ranges that survival in the open is <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> being protected from the explosion's flash energy.|$|E
