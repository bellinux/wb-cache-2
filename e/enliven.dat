This, along with the write-variation introduced by the cache management policies, can lead to very small cache lifetime. In this paper, we propose <b>ENLIVE,</b> a technique for ENhancing the LIfetime of non-Volatile cachEs. Our technique uses a small SRAM (static random access memory) storage, called HotStore. <b>ENLIVE</b> detects frequently written blocks and transfers them to the HotStore {{so that they can}} be accessed with smaller latency and energy. This also reduces the number of writes to the NVM cache which improves its lifetime. We present microarchitectural schemes for managing the HotStore. Simulations have been performed using an x 86 - 64 simulator and benchmarks from SPEC 2006 suite. We observe that <b>ENLIVE</b> provides higher improvement in lifetime and better performance and energy efficiency than two state-of-the-art techniques for improving NVM cache lifetime. <b>ENLIVE</b> provides 8. 47 ×, 14. 67 × and 15. 79 × improvement in lifetime or two, four and eight core systems, respectively.

40|$|Purpose: To {{develop a}} calibrationless {{parallel}} imaging method combining {{the benefits of}} simultaneous estimation of coil profiles and image content of Regular ized Nonlinear Inversion (NLINV) with the robustness of ESPIRiT and evaluate it in initial experiments. Theory and Methods: Parallel imaging {{can be understood as}} recovering coil images that lie in a subspace spanned by the coil sensitivity profiles. In this view, NLINV is a blind multi-channel deconvolution problem which assumes that the coil profiles span the solution subspace. ESPIRiT gains robustness by relaxing this model, allowing multiple sets of images and coil profiles and thereby enlarging that subspace. <b>ENLIVE</b> follows this approach, allowing for a larger subspace while retaining the same formulation as NLINV. This can be related to a lifted formulation of blind deconvolution with nuclear-norm regularization, which inherently promotes low-rank solutions. Hence, there is a relationship to other calibrationless parallel imaging methods based on low-rank matrix completion, such as SAKE and CLEAR. Results: Reconstruction results of several undersampled parallel imaging settings show similar image quality as ESPIRiT without needing explicit calibration data. Image reconstruction time is much shorter than calibrationless parallel imaging with SAKE. Conclusion: The proposed method is suitable for calibrationless and non-Cartesian imaging, and robust in the presence of data inconsistencies.

We have used software to guide learners through design and investigation practices as well as help them describe their scientific observations. In this paper, we present easy-touse software tools that support learners in their construction of robust science conceptions. We investigate how multiple representations such as diagrams, graphs, and animations can provide support for knowledge construction. In addition, we investigate how explanation templates scaffold learners’ interpretations of science. We have combined these tools into one software environment, Jacket’s Garage. 1. The Problem Science education research tells us that understanding science and effectively communicating scientific knowledge is hard. During the 1970 ’s researchers began to listen to what students had to say in science classrooms. Surprisingly, they found that students often had ideas about science that conflicted with what instructors were lecturing about (Smith, diSessa, Roschelle, 1993). Studies in physics classrooms led to research on how students form mental models and misconceptions of the physical world (e. g., diSessa, 1993; Clement 1983). Andrea diSessa, by asking students to discuss physics in everyday situations, wanted to discover how students formed “senses of mechanism – a sense of how things work, what is likely, possible, or impossible ” (diSessa 1993). He discovered that even college physics students had elaborate misconceptions, and some students even provided justification that directly contradicted basic physics principles. Our goal is to help middle school students form mental models that represent how physics actually works; in other words, help them develop correct senses of mechanism. The Learning by Design lab {{has been developing}} curriculum units and software to help middle school students understand physics concepts in the context of design challenges. Learning by Design (LBD) challenges learners to design artifacts to meet defined goals in the context of “engaging design-and-build activities that <b>enlive...</b>|$|R

40|$|The astronomical debate {{developed}} in the Accademia dei Lincei {{during the first three}} decades of the seventeenth century should be considered {{as one of the most}} interesting features of the activity of the academy founded in Rome by Prince Federico Cesi. Indeed, the relationship between the Academy and the spread of eliocentric astronomy is very close, since many of the Lincei were fully involved in the Copernican campaign promoted by Galileo. From this point of view, expecially noteworthy is the "celestial novelties" described in "Sidereus Nuncius" (1610). Let us only recall that Galileo was enrolled as Linceo in 1611, and that two major works of him, the "Istoria e dimostrazioni intorno alle macchie solari" (1613) and "Il Saggiatore" (1623), were published under the aegis of the Academy. The present research aims to outline the development of astronomical views in the context of the Lincei Academy since its establishment in 1603. Starting from the astronomical studies originally performed by the former members (Federico Cesi, Francesco Stelluti, Joannes van Heeck, Anastasio de Filiis), I'll try to reconstruct in detail the whole debate on astronomy that marked the life of the Academy until the decease (in 1630) of its founder and leader, Prince Federico Cesi. Over about thirty years, the Lincei wew engaged in a careful survey of the main problems arousing from the study of celestial phenomena. Despite of the plurality of opinions resulting inside its ranks, the Academy as a whole shared an anti-traditionalistic stance, resolutely siding with the innovative achievements of its most distinguished adherent: Galileo. In its regard, one can remind the position taken up by Federico Cesi (and shared by other major figures of the Academy) on yhe problem of the fluidity of heavens, to not mention the staunch support given by Lincei to galileo's telescopic discoveries and to the latter's advocacy of Copernican cosmology. In conclusion, to go deeper into the details of the astronomical debate which <b>enlived</b> the first three decades of the so called "prima Accademia dei Lincei" will provide us with an unvaluable opportunity to refine the understanding of the dynamics of scientific ideas, by enhancing our knowledge of a very relevant chapter in the intellectual history of the early modern age...|$|R

25|$|Another {{tradition}} of European masks developed, more self-consciously, from court and civic events, or entertainments managed by guilds and co-fraternities.

Thus the Maundy Thursday carnival in St Marks Square in Venice, attended by the Doge and aristocracy also involved the guilds, including a guild of maskmakers. There is evidence of 'commedia dell'arte' inspired Venetian masks and by the late 16th century the Venetian Carnival began to reach its peak and eventually lasted a whole 'season' from January until Lent. By the 18th century, it was already a tourist attraction, Goethe saying that he was ugly enough not to need a mask. The carnival was repressed during the Napoleonic Republic, although in the 1980s its costumes and the masks aping the C 18th heyday were revived.

The careful detail found in her 1937 historical romance, An Infamous Army, attracted critical acclaim. Her other novels never reached this level of positive critical opinion and have been largely overlooked by scholars. Heyer aspired for many years to produce [...] "the magnum opus of my latter years," [...] a medieval trilogy featuring the House of Lancaster. This project failed to come to full fruition, as she faced pressure from eager readers to continue publishing her popular romance novels; the tax liabilities she dealt with were also a factor. Heyer's only installment of the Lancaster trilogy, My Lord John (1975), went unfinished and was published a year after her death.|$|E
