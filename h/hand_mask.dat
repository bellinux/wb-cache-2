40|$|This {{article focuses}} on migrant {{children}} in West Africa in contexts where independent migrations during childhood constitute the norm rather than the exception. The article examines how the relative age and gender of a child influence his/her trajectory. It {{is based on the}} biographies of two young domestic workers &# 8211; a girl in Côte-d&# 8217;Ivoire and a boy in Burkina Faso. In describing their trajectories during the first eight to ten years of their migration to the city, this article shows that ideas surrounding age-appropriate work and the acquisition of new skills allow both girls and boys to increasingly exercise more power over their own lives. From these detailed trajectories it becomes clear that the dominant institutional categories, on the one <b>hand,</b> <b>mask</b> the diversity of activities of these very young migrants. On the other hand, they conceal the diachronic changes that take place {{in the course of their}} migratory work experience...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the problem of the {{automated}} classification of cued speech gestures. Cued speech is a specific gesture language (different from the sign language) used for communication between deaf people and other people. It uses only 8 different hand configurations. The aim of this work is to apply a simple classifier on 3 images data sets, in order to answer two main questions: is 3 D data needed, and how important is the hand segmentation quality ? The first data set consists of images acquired with a single camera in a controlled light environment and a segmentation (called “ 2 D segmentation”) based on luminance information. The second data set is acquired with a 3 D camera which can produce a depth map; a segmentation (called “ 3 D segmentation”) of the hand configurations based on the video and the depth map is performed. The third data set consists in 3 D-segmented masks where the resulting <b>hand</b> <b>mask</b> is warped to compensate for hand pose variations. For the classification purposes, hand configurations are characterized by the computation of the seven Hu moment invariants. Then a supervised classification using a multi-layer perceptron is done. The performance of classification based on 2 D and 3 D information are compared...|$|E
40|$|The {{sampling}} of functions {{is one of}} the most fundamental tasks in computer graphics, and occurs in a variety of different forms. The known sampling methods can roughly be grouped in two categories. Sampling on regular grids is simple and efficient, and the algorithms are often easy to built into graphics hardware. On the down side, regular sampling is prone to aliasing artifacts that are expensive to overcome. Monte Carlo methods, on the other <b>hand,</b> <b>mask</b> the aliasing artifacts by noise. However due to the lack of coherence, these methods are more expensive and not weil suited for hardware implementations. In this paper, we introduce a novel sampling scheme where samples from several regular grids are a combined into a single irregular sampling pattern. The relative positions of the regular grids are themselves determined by Monte Carlo methods. This generalization obtained by interleaving yields,significantly improved quality compared to traditional approaches while at the same time preserving much of the advantageous coherency of regular sampling. We demonstrate the quality of the new sampling scheme with a number of applications ranging from supersampling over motion blur simulation to volume rendering. Due to the coherence in the interleaved samples, the method is optimally suited for implementations in graphics hardware...|$|E

40|$|In {{answer to}} the {{question}} why is fluid dynamics more developed as a science than granular dynamics, one may cite that the Navier-Stokes equations of fluid motion are more developed and more extensively tested. A collection of grains&# 8212;moving or static&# 8212;inherently involves the intermediate or mesoscopic scales of motion: the strong separation of scales from the molecular to the macroscopic flow (Batchelor, 1967) that permits the continuum equations to well embody the physics of flowing fluids does not exist with granular materials, even for the smallest sized grains. Though this is undoubtedly true and represents a substantial theoretical challenge, perhaps in answering our question, we should not discount the ability of the aesthetic qualities of the flows themselves to motivate investigations. Fluid flows are beautiful. Typically opaque grains, on the other <b>hand,</b> <b>mask</b> what motivational beauty might lie in granular flow patterns. In this paper I describe some recent experiments visualising the granular transport in tumbling containers. In &# 0167; 2 I describe quasi- 2 -dimensional experiments in a rotating disk where the patterns can be observed by eye. These are experiments with the desirable qualities that the mixing behaviour can be explicitly viewed, quantified, and substantially modelled. In &# 0167; 3 I describe experiments in the 3 -dimensional extension of the disk&# 8212;a rotating tube. The 3 -d flow is visualised with a non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique which gives direct information on the radial and axial flow patterns. Non-invasive imaging (Nakagawa et al., 1993; Broadbelt et al., 1993; Nikitidis et al., 1994; Jaeger et al., 1996) seems on the verge of providing a wealth of new experimental information on 3 -d granular flows...|$|E
40|$|Hand is an {{important}} part of human in communicating with other persons and interacting with objects in the world. In this thesis, we will explore hand analysis, which includes hand detection, hand posture and hand shape analysis. First I will focus on hand detection. We start by exploring pixel-level hand detection. It is a challenging problem because the appearance of hands can vary greatly in images. We use a random forest framework in order to predict <b>hand</b> <b>mask</b> and hand part labels in an efficient and robust manner. Our approach exploits the inherent contextual information from structured hand labelling for pixel-level hand detection and hand part labelling. Having obtained a pixel-level hand probability map, we present an end-to-end system to detect hands in a bounding box fashion. Our model can not only detect and localize the hands but also provide detailed information within the bounding box by using a multi-task convolutional neural network. Experimental results show that hand detection can be improved by utilizing more information such as hand shape and hand landmark points than only using bounding boxes. In the second part of my thesis, we will concentrate on two specific problems based on the good hand detection results. The first problem is to recognize the hand postures efficiently. We present a flexible method for hand posture recognition by fusing information from color and depth images using kernel descriptors. Existing methods usually focus on designing intuitive features for color and depth images. On the contrary, our method extracts common patch-level features, and combines them by means of kernel descriptors. Linear SVM is used to predict the class label efficiently. The second problem is related to hand shape. We present an interesting application of shape analysis to train a hand shape recognizer automatically from simple sketches, such as a “stick-figure” of a hand shape. We introduce the Hand Boltzmann Machine, a generative model built upon unsupervised learning, to represent the hand shape space of a binary image, and formulate the user provided sketches as an initial guidance for sampling to generate realistic hand shape samples. A hand shape recognizer is trained from these samples and used to classify the hand shapes intuitively. published_or_final_versionComputer ScienceDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

40|$|Concerns {{have been}} {{expressed}} that {{large numbers of}} non-value added reports have been accumulating in ADR databases, for example via patient support programs. We performed an assessment of the impact of such reports, to which we refer to as 'precautionary reports', on safety signal detection in the Netherlands. The case narratives of ADR reports of three case products were screened with text-mining algorithms to identify those reports that lack a causal relationship with the suspected medicinal product. We demonstrate that precautionary reports impede the optimal use of the pharmacovigilance system by, on the one <b>hand,</b> <b>masking</b> safety signals and, on the other hand, creating spurious signals. The precautionary reporting bias and its suppressing effect on statistical signal detection results in an altered adverse event safety profile. The findings from this manuscript highlight the need for a better alignment between regulatory authorities and MAHs regarding pharmacovigilance guidelines. This article is protected by copyright.

30|$|Hand {{segmentation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} fundamental and crucial steps for egocentric human-computer interaction. The special egocentric view brings new challenges to hand segmentation tasks, such as the unpredictable environmental conditions. The performance of traditional hand segmentation methods depend on abundant manually labeled training data. However, these approaches do not appropriately capture the whole properties of egocentric human-computer interaction for neglecting the user-specific context. It is only necessary to build a personalized hand model of the active user. Based on this observation, we propose an online-learning hand segmentation approach without using manually labeled data for training. Our approach consists of top-down classifications and bottom-up optimizations. More specifically, we divide the segmentation task into three parts, a frame-level hand detection which detects the presence of the interactive hand using motion saliency and initializes <b>hand</b> <b>masks</b> for online learning, a superpixel-level hand classification which coarsely segments hand regions from which stable samples are selected for next level, and a pixel-level hand classification which produces a fine-grained hand segmentation. Based on the pixel-level classification result, we update the hand appearance model and optimize the upper layer classifier and detector. This online-learning strategy makes our approach robust to varying illumination conditions and hand appearances. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness of our approach.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{approach}} to segment hand regions in egocentric video that requires no manual labeling of train-ing samples. The user wearing a head-mounted camera is prompted to perform a simple gesture during an initial cal-ibration step. A combination of color and motion analy-sis that exploits knowledge of the expected gesture is ap-plied on the calibration video frames to automatically la-bel hand pixels in an unsupervised fashion. The hand pix-els identified in this manner are used to train a statistical-model-based hand detector. Superpixel region growing is used to perform segmentation refinement and improve ro-bustness to noise. Experiments show that our hand detec-tion technique based on the proposed on-the-fly training ap-proach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques with respect to accuracy and robustness {{on a variety of}} chal-lenging videos. This is due primarily to the fact that train-ing samples are personalized to a specific user and envi-ronmental conditions. We also demonstrate the utility of our hand detection technique to inform an adaptive video sampling strategy that improves both computational speed and accuracy of egocentric action recognition algorithms. Finally, we offer an egocentric video dataset of an insulin self-injection procedure with action labels and <b>hand</b> <b>masks</b> that can serve towards future research on both hand detec-tion and egocentric action recognition. 1...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Difficulties in {{pediatric}} airway {{management are}} common {{and continue to}} result in significant morbidity and mortality. This review reports on current concepts in approaching {{a child with a}} difficult airway. RECENT FINDINGS: Routine airway management in healthy children with normal airways is simple in experienced <b>hands.</b> <b>Mask</b> ventilation (oxygenation) is always possible and tracheal intubation normally simple. However, transient hypoxia is common in these children usually due to unexpected anatomical and functional airway problems or failure to ventilate during rapid sequence induction. Anatomical airway problems (upper airway collapse and adenoid hypertrophy) and functional airway problems (laryngospasm, bronchospasm, insufficient depth of anesthesia and muscle rigidity, gastric hyperinflation, and alveolar collapse) require urgent recognition and treatment algorithms due to insufficient oxygen reserves. Early muscle paralysis and epinephrine administration aids resolution of these functional airway obstructions. Children with an 'impaired' normal (foreign body, allergy, and inflammation) or an expected difficult (scars, tumors, and congenital) airway require careful planning and expertise. Training in the recognition and management of these different situations as well as a suitably equipped anesthesia workstation and trained personnel are essential. SUMMARY: The healthy child with an unexpected airway problem requires clear strategies. The 'impaired' normal pediatric airway may be handled by anesthetists experienced with children, whereas the expected difficult pediatric airway requires dedicated pediatric anesthesia specialist care and should only be managed in specialized centers...|$|R
