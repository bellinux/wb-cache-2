50|$|The first {{proposed}} shock absorber was a ring-shaped airbag. It was soon realized that, should an explosion fail, the 500-1000 tonne pusher plate would tear away the airbag on the rebound. So a two-stage detuned spring and piston shock absorber design was developed. On the reference design the <b>first</b> <b>stage</b> mechanical absorber was tuned to 4.5 times the pulse frequency whilst the second <b>stage</b> gas <b>piston</b> was tuned to 0.5 times the pulse frequency. This permitted timing tolerances of 10 ms in each explosion.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe high {{capacity}} cryocooler working below 30 K can find many {{applications such as}} superconducting motors, superconducting cables and cryopump. Compared to the GM cryocooler, the Stirling cryocooler can achieve higher efficiency and more compact structure. Because of these obvious advantages, we have designed a two <b>stage</b> free <b>piston</b> Stirling cryocooler system, which is driven by a moving magnet linear compressor with an operating frequency of 40 Hz and a maximum 5 kW input electric power. The <b>first</b> <b>stage</b> of the cryocooler is designed {{to operate in the}} liquid nitrogen temperature and output a cooling power of 100 W. And the second stage is expected to simultaneously provide a cooling power of 50 W below the temperature of 30 K. In order to achieve the best system efficiency, a numerical model based on the thermoacoustic model was developed to optimize the system operating and structure parameters...|$|R
