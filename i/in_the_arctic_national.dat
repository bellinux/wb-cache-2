5|$|Various {{advocacy}} groups have given Biden scores or grades {{as to how}} well his votes align with the positions of each group. The American Civil Liberties Union gives him an 80 percent lifetime score, with a 91 percent score for the 110th Congress. Biden opposes drilling for oil <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> <b>National</b> Wildlife Refuge and supports governmental funding to find new energy sources. Biden believes action must be taken on global warming. He co-sponsored the Sense of the Senate resolution calling on the United States {{to be a part}} of the United Nations climate negotiations and the Boxer-Sanders Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act, the most stringent climate bill in the United States Senate. Biden was given an 85percent lifetime approval rating from AFL-CIO, and he voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).|$|E
5|$|Biden is {{considered}} to be a moderate liberal, clocking a 77.5 percent liberal voting record in 2006 and lifetime score of 76.8 percent. Biden is Pro-Choice on abortion rated 100% by NARAL and supports a state's right to have civil unions. He favors a Balanced Budget Amendment and a rollback of the Bush tax cuts. He supports the PATRIOT Act, the war in Afghanistan and voted in favor of authorization of military force into Iraq. He believes a political solution can be met in Iraq through federalization. Biden would favor American military intervention into Sudan to end the Darfur genocide. He supports Gun control and was given an F by the NRA. He opposes the No Child Left Behind Act although he voted in favor of it in 2002. Biden opposes capital punishment and supports the continuation of the war on drugs. In 2007 he voted in favor of the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Bill and supports a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. Biden opposes oil drilling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> <b>National</b> Wildlife Refuge and believes that the government must take action against global warming.|$|E

40|$|Contrary to claims from American politicians, lobbyists, {{and oil and}} gas executives, {{allowing}} {{energy development}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Alaskan <b>Arctic</b> <b>National</b> Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) will harm the environment, compromise international law, erode the social significance of wilderness protection, and ultimately fail to␣increase the energy security of the United States.

Less obvious but equally important, oil and gas exploration in ANWR will violate a number of international treaties on biodiversity protection. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> end, development <b>in</b> ANWR will threaten the concept of wilderness protection, and will do little to end US dependence on foreign sources of energy...|$|R

50|$|Healthy adult {{birds have}} few natural predators. Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) may {{threaten}} breeding females and particular {{the eggs and}} hatchlings. Adults typically can stand their ground and displace foxes but occasionally the foxes are successful. Another surprisingly serious nest predator for tundra swans are brown bears (Ursus arctos), which were apparently {{the primary cause of}} nesting failure <b>in</b> both <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> <b>National</b> Wildlife Refuge and Izembek National Wildlife Refuge. Other potential nest predators include red fox (Vulpes vulpes), golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos), parasitic jaegers (Stercorarius parasiticus), and glaucous gull (Larus hyperboreus). Brown bear, golden eagles and, rarely, gray wolves (Canis lupus) may on occasion succeed at capturing and killing an adult. Small or avian predators usually elicit either an aggressive response or the behavior of sitting tight on nests while larger mammals, perhaps more dangerous to adults, usually elicit the response of leading the cygnets into deep waters and standing still until they pass. About 15% of the adults die each year from various causes, and thus <b>the</b> average lifespan <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wild is about 10 years. The oldest recorded tundra swan was over 24 years old.|$|R

Artifacts and faunal material suggest that the site was used for processing caribou (including breaking bones for marrow and grease extraction). A variety of lithic tools associated with the hunting and processing of caribou were recorded, but most were manufactured off-site.

40|$|While <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> is on <b>the</b> {{front lines}} of climate change, it {{is also on the}} {{front lines of}} {{experiments}} in governance. Chinese, Japanese, and Korean interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> is pressuring <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> Council, <b>the</b> region’s preeminent multilateral organization, to reconsider how it cooperates with states traditionally perceived as non-Arctic. The seafaring states of China, Japan, and Korea have commercial interests <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> involving shipping, hydrocarbons, and fisheries. Yet questions of identity and power projection are also paramount, as <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> allows <b>the</b> Northeast Asian countries to display their growing capabilities through scientific endeavors and maritime transits. Several of <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> Council’s member states, namely Canada and Russia, assertively promote national sovereignty and territoriallyascribed sovereignty <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region. But networks and relations are crucial aspects of activities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> circumpolar north, especially when scientific collaboration and natural resource extraction require large amounts of capital and cooperation. Flows of capital, goods, and people are connecting Chinese consumers with mineral deposits in Greenland and Korean engineers with Russian oil oligarchs. At the same time, these flows do not mean that we should constrain our thinking about <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> to one side of the territory-network dichotomy. China promotes <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> as a global commons while it simultaneously claims to be a near- <b>Arctic</b> state, revealing <b>the</b> tension between privileging flows and territory <b>in</b> <b>the</b> circumpolar north.
