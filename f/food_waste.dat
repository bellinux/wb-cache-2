A widespread pilot scheme for separate <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> collection, involving nineteen English local authorities, achieved success and 'high levels of satisfaction' from households.|$|E
5|$|<b>Food</b> <b>waste</b> is {{generally}} considered to have a damaging effect on the environment; a reduction in <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> is considered critical if the UK is to meet obligations under the European Landfill Directive to reduce biodegradable waste going to landfill and favourable considering international targets on climate change, limiting greenhouse gas emissions. When disposed of in landfill, <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> releases methane, a relatively damaging greenhouse gas, and leachate, a toxin capable of considerable groundwater pollution. The food supply chain accounts for a fifth of UK carbon emissions; the production, storage and transportation of food to homes requires large amounts of energy. The effects of stopping <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> that can potentially be prevented has been likened to removing one in five cars from UK roads.|$|E
5|$|<b>Food</b> <b>waste</b> puts a large {{burden on}} the {{finances}} of each household and local councils in the UK; wasted food is estimated to cost each British household £250–£400 per year, accumulating to £15,000–£24,000 over a lifetime. This comes from the total purchasing cost of the food against what is thrown away uneaten. Additionally, households pay for the collection and disposal of <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> by their local council {{in the form of}} council tax. For councils, the cost of <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> comes from its collection and disposal {{as a part of the}} waste stream; this is especially an issue for councils that run separate <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> collections.|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to assess the nutritional potential of <b>food</b> <b>wastes</b> to be transformed into duck meat. In both experiments, 600 day-old unsexed White Pekin ducklings were randomly distributed into 6 different dietary treatment groups. In both experiments, the ducks receiving <b>food</b> <b>wastes</b> had significantly ($ rm P< 0. 05 $) more total body fat than did the control. This was most likely due to the quantity of dietary fat ingested by the ducks. The results reported in this thesis indicate {{that it is possible}} to raise Pekin ducks to market weight using <b>food</b> <b>wastes</b> as the only source of feed. To meet the consumer demand of leaner carcasses, the <b>food</b> <b>wastes</b> with a high fat content should be included in a limited amount in the ration.

30|$|After the {{moisture}} contained in <b>food</b> <b>wastes</b> was removed using a dryer, the dried <b>food</b> <b>wastes</b> were discharged with MSW. MSW including dried <b>food</b> <b>wastes</b> {{were collected by}} a garbage truck and stored at a transfer station. The wastes were moved to a resource recovery facility for incineration and burnt at 850 °C to approximately 1, 100 °C. The high-temperature gas produced steam which operated a steam turbine and then produced electricity. The steam was passed to a heat exchanger, and it supported the residential area's hot water for room heating. Air emissions and wastewater were discharged during the process.

5|$|Other sectors also {{attribute}} to {{the amounts of}} <b>food</b> <b>waste.</b> The food industry produces large amounts of <b>food</b> <b>waste,</b> with retailers alone generating 1,600,000 tonnes of <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> per year. Supermarkets particularly have been criticised for wasting items which are damaged or unsold (what the industry calls 'surplus food'), but that often remain edible. However, exact statistics {{for the amount of}} food wasted by supermarkets is mostly unavailable; although a few voluntarily release data on <b>food</b> <b>waste,</b> it is not required by law. Similarly, limited information is available on amounts generated by the agricultural sector. Before a reversal of European Union policy in 2008, which came into effect on 1 July 2009, misshaped or 'wonky' fruit and vegetables could not be sold by retailers and were required to be thrown away.|$|E

40|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} is {{an alternative}} method to digest <b>food</b> <b>wastes</b> and to produce methane {{that can be used}} as a renewable energy source. We investigated bacterial and archaeal community structures in a three-stage methane production process using <b>food</b> <b>wastes</b> with concomitant wastewater treatment. The three-stage methane process is composed of semianaerobic hydrolysis/acidogenic, anaerobic acidogenic, and strictly anaerobic methane production steps in which <b>food</b> <b>wastes</b> are converted methane and carbon dioxide. The microbial diversity was determined by the nucleotide sequences of 16 S rRNA gene library and quantitative real-time PCR. The major eubacterial population of the three-stage methane process was belonging to VFA-oxidizing bacteria. The archaeal community consisted mainly of two species of hydrogenotrophic methanogen (Methanoculleus). Family Picrophilaceae (Order Thermoplasmatales) was also observed as a minor population. The predominance of hydrogenotrophic methanogen suggests that the main degradation pathway of this process is different from the classical methane production systems that have the pathway based on acetogenesis. The domination of hydrogenotrophic methanogen (Methanoculleus) may be caused by mesophilic digestion, neutral pH, high concentration of ammonia, short HRT...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was {{to carry out a}} {{feasibility}} study of implementing a small-scale biogas plant on KTH campus using <b>food</b> <b>wastes</b> from the neighbouring restaurants and KTH kitchens as input substrate, where the biogas produced could be used in the Energy laboratory, to run the micro turbine, as an example. Considering that KTH has 10 departments and that each department has its own kitchen, the amount of <b>food</b> <b>wastes</b> that can be recuperated for input to the plant is around 225 kg per day for a normal working week, requiring a 10 m 3 biogas plant. This report also relates to the potential implementation of small-scale biogas plants on farms in Mauritius using manure and crop endings as input substrate as a solution to the waste management problems the farmers are currently facing as well as using the biogas to provide energy for cooking and heating. Based on the quantity of <b>food</b> <b>wastes</b> available from the neighbouring restaurants, the sizing of the proposed biogas plant was calculated and the best technical and commercial options were considered. An experimental biogas plant was setup on the campus and the planning and logistics involved were studied as well as the potential quantity and quality of gas produced from <b>food</b> <b>wastes.</b> The optimal biogas production for a 5 m 3 capacity biogas plant and processing <b>food</b> <b>wastes</b> is 6 to 10 m 3 of biogas per day composed of about 68 - 72 % methane.

40|$|The {{anaerobic}} digestion process involves the decomposition {{of the organic}} matter to yield biogas; gas that is mainly composed of methane and carbon dioxide with traces of some other gases. This process is used for different purposes including municipal waste treatment, wastewater treatment, fertilizer production, and farm wastes disposal as well as energy production. It is accomplished in three main stages; hydrolysis, acidogenesis and methanogenesis {{with each of the}} stages achieved by specific microorganisms that are active in limited ranges of operational and environmental conditions. These conditions are controlled to achieve an optimal output of the process. For example for the energy production purposes, the energy output needs to be optimised in terms of operating conditions. To produce an optimal amount of biogas from a certain substrate, the latter should be analysed for its nutritional composition and if some of the nutrients are not in appropriate amounts they are adjusted by mixing more than one type of substrates. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the effect of improving substrate nutritional composition on the optimal yield of the {{anaerobic digestion}} process. In other words, we are looking at a way to increasing the biogas yield by improving the qualitative composition of the substrates. To achieve this objective, a thorough literature review was done to be aware of the effect of various environmental and operational parameters on the yield of the anaerobic digestion. These parameters include the temperature, the pH of the substrates, the carbon to nitrogen ratio, total solids content and substrates composition. To study the effect of the latter, we carried out an inventory of the mostly used substrates for the production of biogas. These include agricultural residues, animal manures, municipal solid <b>wastes</b> and <b>food</b> <b>wastes.</b> <b>Food</b> <b>wastes</b> collected from the kitchen and exclusively fruit wastes were digested at 55 ± 2 o C and at 37 ± 2 o C. Digestion of <b>food</b> <b>wastes</b> characterised by a total solids content of 10. 423 % and volatile solids to total solids content of 89. 145 % produced 95 mL/g VS of biogas at thermophilic temperature, fruit wastes with a total solids content of 8. 253 % and volatile solids to total solids content of 91. 495 % produced 30 mL/g VS. Mixed together making total solids content of 12. 493 % and volatile solids to total solids content ratio of 86. 988 % <b>food</b> and fruit <b>wastes</b> produced 110 mL/g VS. Results of this study show that mixing <b>food</b> <b>wastes</b> with fruit wastes improved the biogas yield by 13. 67 %. The same increase was observable at mesophilic temperature.
