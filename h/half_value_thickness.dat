In this work, correspondence of hardness to <b>half</b> <b>value</b> broad of X-ray for several kinds of steel treated of diffrent tempering temperatures was examined.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{study the}} effect of 1 drop of 0. 5 % proparacaine on central corneal <b>thickness</b> <b>values</b> {{monitored}} by nonspecular microscopy and Pentacam, a corneal topographer with rotating Scheimpflug camera. METHODS: Forty subjects were divided into 2 groups with 1 group measured with a noncontact specular microscope and the other group with Pentacam (Oculus, Inc., Wetzlar, Germany). One eye was randomly selected, and corneal <b>thickness</b> <b>values</b> were monitored every 30 seconds for 10 minutes. Baseline corneal <b>thickness</b> <b>values</b> were defined as the average of all measurements taken over 10 minutes. One drop of 0. 5 % proparacaine was instilled, and the corneal <b>thickness</b> <b>values</b> were monitored by the same instrument every 30 seconds for another 10 minutes after drug instillation. RESULTS: The 2 groups shared similar age range, refractive error, and baseline corneal <b>thickness</b> <b>values.</b> The spontaneous variation of corneal <b>thickness</b> <b>values</b> was within 3 μm for 10 minutes before drug instillation.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{validate}} the kilovoltage X-ray energy spectrum on the ID 17 beamline at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). The purpose of such validation was to provide an accurate energy spectrum as the input to a computerized treatment planning system, which will be used in synchrotron microbeam radiotherapy trials at the ESRF. Calculated and measured energy spectra on ID 17 have been reported previously but recent additions and safety modifications to the beamline for veterinary trials warranted a fresh investigation. The authors used an established methodology to compare X-ray attenuation measurements in copper sheets (referred to as <b>half</b> <b>value</b> layer measurements in the radiotherapy field) with the predictions of a theoretical model. A cylindrical ionization chamber in air was used to record the relative attenuation of the X-ray beam intensity by increasing thicknesses of high-purity copper sheets. The authors measured the <b>half</b> <b>value</b> layers in copper for two beamline configurations, which corresponded to differing spectral conditions. The authors obtained good agreement between the measured and predicted <b>half</b> <b>value</b> layers for the two beamline configurations. The measured first <b>half</b> <b>value</b> layer was 1. 754 +/- 0. 035 mm Cu and 1. 962 +/- 0. 039 mm Cu for the two spectral conditions, compared with theoretical predictions of 1. 763 +/- 0. 039 mm Cu and 1. 984 +/- 0. 044 mm Cu, respectively. The calculated mean energies for the two conditions were 105 keV and 110 keVand there was not a substantial difference in the calculated percentage depth dose curves in water between the different spectral conditions. The authors observed a difference between their calculated energy spectra and the spectra previously reported by other authors, particularly at energies greater than 100 keV. The validation of the beam spectrum by the copper <b>half</b> <b>value</b> layer measurements means the authors can provide an accurate spectrum as an input to a treatment planning system for the forthcoming veterinary trials of microbeam radiotherapy to spontaneous tumours in cats and dogs...|$|R

40|$|Purpose To {{determine}} the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness at which visual field (VF) damage becomes detectable and associated with structural loss.

All patients had VF examinations (Swedish Interactive Threshold Algorithm 24 - 2 test of the Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer 750 i) and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography RNFL scans. Comparison of RNFL <b>thickness</b> <b>values</b> with VF threshold values showed a plateau of VF threshold values at high RNFL <b>thickness</b> <b>values</b> and then a sharp decrease at lower RNFL <b>thickness</b> <b>values.</b> A broken stick statistical {{analysis was used to}} estimate the tipping point at which RNFL <b>thickness</b> <b>values</b> are associated with VF defects. The slope for the association between structure and function was computed for data above and below the tipping point. Results The mean RNFL <b>thickness</b> <b>value</b> that was associated with initial VF loss was 89 μm. The superior RNFL <b>thickness</b> <b>value</b> that was associated with initial corresponding inferior VF loss was 100 μm. The inferior RNFL <b>thickness</b> <b>value</b> that was associated with initial corresponding superior VF loss was 73 μm. The differences between all the slopes above and below the aforementioned tipping points were statistically significant (P <. 001). Conclusions In open-angle glaucoma, substantial RNFL thinning or structural loss appears to be necessary before functional visual field defects become detectable. © 2014 by elsevier inc. all rights reserved...|$|R

The calibrator generates lightning impulses (LI) with known peak value (UP), front time (T 1), and time to <b>half</b> <b>value</b> (T 2); or switching impulses (SI) with known peak value (UP), time to peak (TP), and time to <b>half</b> <b>value</b> (T 2). The peak voltages of the constructed devices range from 50  mV to 1000  V. The calibration of impulse voltage measuring equipment is required both by high voltage and quality standards, and the gap between the best measurement accuracy available at National Metrology Institutes; the accuracy that is required in high voltage testing has been very narrow. The only way to improve the situation is to lower the measurement uncertainty levels in the National Metrology Institutes. In this work, the traceability of the peak and time parameter values is based on the modelling of the circuit, and the calculation of these parameters according to network theory. This calculation is based on the calibrated component (resistor and capacitor) values of the impulse circuit. The uncertainty in the peak values is low, as the peak value is not sensitive to changes in the component values of the circuit. The estimated uncertainties for lightning impulse calibrators are 0, 05 % for peak value, 0, 5 % for front time, and 0, 3 % for time to <b>half</b> <b>value.</b> For switching impulses the corresponding uncertainties are 0, 1 %, 0, 4 % and 0, 3 %.
