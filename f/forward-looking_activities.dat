In this context, <b>forward-looking</b> <b>activities</b> are meant to inspire new EU policies by providing fresh insights and identifying major societal challenges (EC 2010) through different inputs.

30|$|The {{question}} of how technology affects society {{is one of the}} central issues not only in Futures Studies, but in social sciences in general. The dynamics of how an emergent technology or a technological cluster affects societal practices are far from being clearly understood, and yet they can be argued to be at the very core of any <b>forward-looking</b> <b>activity</b> involving social aspects. In this article we aim at understanding the effect of technological change through micro-level practices in the working life.|$|R

Its function is to achieve performance improvement, guarding assets and resources against waste or loss, to manage human resources and all other kinds of resources. The organization {{is supported by a}} governing board that must perform well in order to achieve excellence and accomplish all governance needs. Financial management is a <b>forward-looking</b> <b>activity</b> with long term time horizon so the aim is to balance costs and benefits, improving quality care programs. The health system has to develop strategies for cost-effectiveness and rationalization of all the resources involved according to the organizational needs. It is important to create and support an efficient and effective structure. This paper presents a multi-criteria decision analysis by the application of the ANP - Analytic Network Process and the BSC - Balanced Scorecard. The research suggests a new methodological approach that can improve the efficiency of a well managed health organization characterized by multidisciplinary teams that have to interact together in order to gain continuous performance improvement and implement all functions efficiently and effectively...|$|R

30|$|In shaping socio-technical {{change through}} informing STI policy, <b>forward-looking</b> <b>activities</b> can fulfil several functions: {{eliciting}} shared goals and visions {{among a group}} of participating actors from different sectors, creating and fostering new networks and structures, combining relevant information on current trends and future developments, as well as addressing system deficiencies and failures [12, 13]. For instance, the collaborative development of cross-cutting challenges for European policy making that demand coordinated policy actions was supported by <b>forward-looking</b> <b>activities</b> [20, 21]. Especially when dealing with the Grand Challenges, Futures Studies need to attend to the distinctive role of challenging predictions that are mainly based on extrapolated past events by emphasizing on creativity to present true alternatives [9]. Nevertheless, producing such socio-technical imaginaries may only shape futures appropriated to those engaged in the visioning process [22], whereas other—at times socially more robust—futures may become ever more inaccessible. This implies broad engagement strategies, moving away from reductionist experts-only-settings when creating such imaginaries.|$|E
40|$|Trade-related {{capacity}} building (TRCB) {{is intended to}} help developing countries address market distortions, supply-side bottlenecks and other constraints created by increased market access and economic integration. To date TRCB has paid insufficient attention to environmental sustainability and cross-programme coordination. ● Strengthening the environmental sustainability components of TRCB programmes can address environmental problems created by expanding markets. This strengthening is urgently needed at the regional level alongside accelerating regional economic integration. ● Aid-for-Trade (AfT), which allocates official development assistance (ODA) for TRCB, could make trade more sustainable in Asia. However, this chapter shows much of the current TRCB landscape {{is made up of}} short-term, piecemeal efforts. ● The chapter therefore recommends that international and regional organisations cooperate to assess national environmental needs in TRCB programmes at the regional level and devise a more coherent, <b>forward-looking</b> set of <b>activities.</b> ● Different countries and stakeholders have different {{capacity building}} needs. For governments, the proposed assessment framework could include tools and knowledge to assess the environmental impacts of relevant national policies and international negotiating positions. Here, experiences related to Trade and Sustainability Impact Assessments in the European Union and elsewhere could be useful. ● Existing TRCB programmes, especially programmes under the WTO, should strengthen their environmental components, UNEP should play a greater role in strengthening these components and its implementation capacity should be boosted accordingly. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} if the world’s {{central banks}} setting of monetary policy rates {{is sensitive to}} financial variables, controlling for conventional monetary policy determinants. We specify and estimate an extended Taylor rule that includes, in addition to real-time backward and <b>forward-looking</b> inflation and <b>activity</b> variables, three financial variables. First, we include exchange-rate devaluation, reflecting possible fear of floating and fear of devaluation-inflation pass-through. Then we include two financial variables that may indicate bubbles and overheating to test for monetary behavior reflecting leaning against the wind: the change in stock market prices and the growth in bank credit to the private sector. We estimate our model using the Pooled Mean Group estimator applied to an unbalanced world panel of monthly 1994 - 2011 observations for 28 advanced and emerging economies, representing 80 % of the world’s GDP. We find that central banks react to changes in exchange rates and credit flows, both {{in the short term}} and long term. We also find that industrial-country central banks respond to stock-market returns and exchange-rate changes in the long term, while central banks in emerging economies react to credit flows and exchange rates both in the short and the long term. Finally, we find that inflation-targeting countries take into account exchange rates and We thank Antonio Martner and Carlos Medel for generous help with data provision.

30|$|In futures studies, {{the turn}} started early. From the 1960 s on, {{participation}} became a key term in democratic theory (Pateman 1970) and, {{around the same}} time, some futurists started to step beyond the field’s military origins and began integrating participatory methods into <b>forward-looking</b> <b>activities.</b> Parallel {{to the development of}} participatory technology assessment, this movement gained momentum in the 1990 s and continues to evolve rapidly today (for a detailed history of participation in futures studies see List 2006).|$|E
30|$|On the one hand, {{participatory}} {{methods for}} public engagement {{in research and}} innovation are abundant [33]. A recent analysis shows that with regard to research program development—agenda setting—the involvement of civil society organizations or other stakeholders is common practice, while citizens are only involved seldom [34]. On the other hand, expert- and stakeholder-centered <b>forward-looking</b> <b>activities</b> (FLA) {{have proven to be}} effective in supporting RI programming [35 – 38]. However, lay-people’s involvement in FLA with regard to advice-giving mechanisms for science and innovation programming is relatively new and rare [39 – 42].|$|E
30|$|There {{remains the}} {{question}} of why individual citizens, outside of organised civil society, would engage in envisioning a far-off future. There might be numerous reasons, such as curiosity, boredom or simply the promise of a good buffet at the hotel. We assume that a sense of responsibility for the future played an important part. This is reflected in the expectations participants had of taking part in CIVISTI. The majority of citizens stated as their main interest: “empowering citizens to influence European research issues” and “ensuring that research is guided by common societal interests” (Brandstetter et al. 2011, p. 10). Participatory <b>forward-looking</b> <b>activities</b> should be able to mobilise participants to actively take part in discussions on a future more than 25  years distant.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} harness {{expectations}} and provide policy advice for actively shaping futures, <b>forward-looking</b> <b>activities</b> (FLA) often elicit experts’ opinions. Additionally, stakeholder engagement {{has become a}} norm {{over the course of}} the past two decades [3]. This shift towards democratizing knowledge production has had a long development, described for instance as the participatory turn in science [4] or post-normal science [5]. Here, the co-production of socially robust knowledge by linking different types of knowledge is a main aim of transdisciplinary research (e.g., [6 – 8]. And also in futures studies, the shift towards participation which began in the 1970 s [9, 10] gained momentum in the 1990 s [11] and led to the development of a number of participatory frameworks for futures research [12 – 14].|$|E
30|$|Looking back on {{the many}} prophets who tried {{to predict the future}} as if it were predetermined, at first sight any forward-looking {{activity}} is reminiscent of making predictions with a crystal ball. In contrast to fortune tellers, today’s exercises do not predict, but try to show different paths that an open future could take. A key motivation to undertake <b>forward-looking</b> <b>activities</b> is broadening the information basis for decision-makers to help them actively shape the future in a desired way. Experts, laypeople, or stakeholders may have different sets of values and priorities with regard to pending decisions on any issue related to the future. Therefore, considering and incorporating their views can, in the best case scenario, lead to more robust decisions and strategies. However, transferring this plurality into a form that decision-makers can consider is a challenge in terms of both design and facilitation of participatory processes. In this paper, we will introduce and critically assess a new qualitative method for <b>forward-looking</b> <b>activities,</b> namely CIVISTI (Citizen Visions on Science, Technology and Innovation; www.civisti.org), which was developed during an EU project of the same name. Focussing strongly on participation, with clear roles for citizens and experts, the method combines expert, stakeholder and lay knowledge to elaborate recommendations for decision-making in issues related to today’s and tomorrow’s science, technology and innovation. Consisting of three steps, the process starts with citizens’ visions of a future 30 – 40  years from now. Experts then translate these visions into practical recommendations which the same citizens then validate and prioritise to produce a final product. The following paper will highlight the added value as well as limits of the CIVISTI method and will illustrate potential for the improvement of future processes.|$|E
40|$|<b>Forward-looking</b> <b>activities</b> (FLAs) can {{influence}} innovation systems {{in various ways}} to a significant extent. This paper focuses on changes induced by FLAs in the innovation policy governance sub-systems (IPGSs) of the national innovation system (NIS). Our knowledge is surprisingly limited even on this subset of FLA impacts, despite several decades of practice and non-negligible analytical efforts. We propose new taxonomies of FLAs and IPGSs and explore hypotheses on the likely 'fit' between different types of FLAs and various IPGSs. Countries selected to illustrate the relevance of our analytical framework include Germany, Greece, and Hungary. Our intention is contribute to a more refined theory building concerning the role and likely impacts of FLAs. Further, as {{a better understanding of}} impacts supports the design of more appropriate and effective FLAs, as well as more insightful evaluation of FLAs, this approach is of practical relevance, too...|$|E
40|$|This chapter explores {{current and}} {{forthcoming}} sustainable development challenges. By comparing the EU Sustainable Development Strategy (European Council, 2006), its related monitoring reports and the ´Facing the future: {{time for the}} EU to meet global challenges` (Boden et al., 2010) report, we can conclude that many identified future-oriented issues cover topics well reflected in sustainability indicator systems. Such comparison can help policy-making in view of developing better understanding on unsustainable trends and respective need for correction or prevention. Our findings suggest also that data collection could be enhanced to better monitor emerging issues currently not well covered by indicator systems. Today’s sustainability indicator systems offer information on past and present states but provide limited support to understand future developments. Combining sustainability monitoring with <b>forward-looking</b> <b>activities</b> (FLA) could therefore enhance policy support in developing more adaptive and anticipatory approaches to better orient societal change towards sustainable development.

30|$|Seen epistemologically, the {{internal}} quality criteria ought {{to represent the}} level of validity that refers to constitutive values (referring to sound methodological procedures), while the external quality criteria amount to contextual values (referring to personal or group values). But as indicated earlier, these attributions are not clear enough as they are also used to distinguish the socio-epistemic view on knowledge creation from traditional epistemology (see reference to Goldman in the introduction). The epistemological question about internality and externality encompasses the notion that justifications either rely on facts to which the knowing one or individual has access to (or: knowledge evolves from individuals justifying their knowledge personally, also known as internalist position) or on reasons to which the knowing individual does not necessarily have {{to have access to}} (externalist position). Socio-epistemic accounts mostly rely upon the externalist position [17, 40]. In contrast, the distinction between internal and external validity in the quality criteria by Kuusi, Cuhls and Steinmüller do not directly refer to the future knowledge created, but to internal validity in forms of “well-organized process[es]” and “pragmatic and organizational approaches” and to external validity in terms of sound reasons and relevant conclusions. Hence, the criteria for external validity can be seen as related to the future knowledge produced by <b>forward-looking</b> <b>activities.</b> Therefore, when underpinning foresight by social epistemology, a clear understanding of internal and external is needed.|$|E
40|$|Long-term {{planning}} with a time-horizon beyond 20 to 30 {{years is}} an established element of policymaking in some core {{fields such as}} certain infrastructure policies, and is a substantial principle of sustainable development. At the same time short- and medium-term planning is much more usual {{in the search for}} ad-hoc solutions to environmental, economic and social challenges. Economic actors apply flexible policies and use short-term opportunities for their profit. Environmental and social problems also sometimes imply short-term solutions for the survival of a system in acute danger. This creates a paradoxical situation: the society in question needs to define long-term targets for its infrastructure and achieves systematic changes pursuing those, but the necessary short-term actions and flexibility applied to stay functionable might not be in line with longterm goals. If this apparent paradox cannot be solved through an appropriate governance method, it might lead to a conflict between different policy goals. The concept of reflexive governance for transition management tries to solve this apparent paradox and combines a number of short-term planning processes in a stagewise and reflexive way to create a more comprehensive and innovative process of long-term planning for a sustainable development. Future-oriented analyses and <b>forward-looking</b> <b>activities</b> are a fix element at each stage. This contribution points out some key questions for a flexible long-term planning process within the framework of sustainable development. The main challenge is how different knowledge types such as citizens’ visions and experts’ recommendations can be integrated into long-term planning in order to support an interactive decision-making process that considers a broader basis of information. CIVISTI, an innovative forward-looking approach, addresses this challenge. The CIVISTI method has been developed during the recent EUproject on Citizen Visions on Science, Technology and Innovation (CIVISTI 2008 - 2011). In this paper we introduce and discuss this method as a reflexive instrument for integrating different types of knowledge and creating a bridge between short- and long-term planning...|$|E
