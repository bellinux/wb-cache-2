5|$|As {{support for}} {{multiple}} instruction set architectures complicates symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) support, DragonFly BSD now limits its {{support to the}} x86-64 platform. DragonFly originally ran on the x86 architecture, however as of version 4.0 {{it is no longer}} supported. Since version 1.10, DragonFly supports 1:1 userland threading (one kernel thread per userland thread), which <b>is</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> relatively simple solution that is also easy to maintain.
