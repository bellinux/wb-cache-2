5|$|Recent {{scientific}} investigations support Waitt’s proposed {{separation of}} layers into records of sequential flood events. Although the various sources support temporal separation of floods, {{they do not}} definitively identify the source of water {{for all of the}} floods, though they all agree that Lake Missoula was source <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> of them.|$|E
5|$|A new extant genus {{discovered}} in 2014, Dendrogramma, {{which appears to}} be a basal metazoan but of unknown taxonomic placement, has been noted to have similarities with the Ediacaran fauna. It has since been found to be a siphonophore, possibly even sections of a more complex species, though this in turn has raised suspicions for a similar status <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> ediacaran organisms.|$|E
5|$|Ice rafted debris distribution: Sediment {{transported by}} ice {{does not extend}} as far East during H3/6. Hence some {{researchers}} have been moved to suggest a European origin <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> H3/6 clasts: America and Europe were originally adjacent to one another; hence, the rocks on each continent are difficult to distinguish, and the source is open to interpretation (Grousset et al. 2000).|$|E
50|$|Meningiomas are {{significantly}} {{more common in}} women than in men; they are most common in middle-aged women. Two predisposing factors associated with meningiomas <b>for</b> which <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> evidence exists are exposure to ionizing radiation (cancer treatment of brain tumors) and hormone replacement therapy.|$|R

5|$|In Yellowstone's hot waters, {{bacteria}} form mats {{of bizarre}} shapes consisting of trillions of individuals. These bacteria {{are some of}} the most primitive life forms on earth. Flies and other arthropods live on the mats, even in the middle of the bitterly cold winters. Initially, scientists thought that microbes there gained sustenance only from sulfur. In 2005 researchers from the University of Colorado at Boulder discovered that the sustenance <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> of the diverse hyperthermophilic species is molecular hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Musculoskeletal {{analysis}} showed significant gender lifestyle variation. Greater leg muscle development {{was found in}} males of the Parc Cwm cromlech, possibly the result of hunting or herding, confirming the sexual dimorphism found in previous analyses of the remains. In contrast, no such variation was noticeable in the remains found during excavations from other nearby sites, for example the Tinkinswood burial chamber, in the Vale of Glamorgan. The variation in musculoskeletal stress markers may indicate a mobile lifestyle <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> of the males analysed.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possibility}} {{was suggested}} by Brooks: Penda might have lost power {{at some point}} after Heavenfield, and Eowa may have actually been ruling the Mercians <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> of the period as a subject ally or puppet of Oswald. Brooks cited Bede's statement implying that Penda's fortunes were mixed during his 22 years in power and noted the possibility that Penda's fortunes were low at this time. Thus {{it may be that}} Penda was not consistently the dominant figure in Mercia during the years between Hatfield and Maserfield. argues against the idea that Penda and Eowa were co-rulers, and favours the idea that Eowa was ruling Mercia from c. 635 until 642.|$|E

5|$|Haynes asked Fitch {{to observe}} the ailerons through the {{passenger}} cabin windows to see if control inputs were having any effect. Fitch reported back that the ailerons were not moving at all. Nonetheless, the crew continued to manipulate their control columns {{for the remainder of}} the flight, hoping <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> effect. Haynes then asked Fitch to take over control of the throttles so that Haynes could concentrate on his control column. With one throttle in each hand, Fitch was able to mitigate the phugoid cycle and make rough steering adjustments.|$|E
5|$|Morgan {{was driving}} from Leeds to Southampton Docks {{when he picked}} up Figard on 19 December 1995. Detectives {{concluded}} that after raping and killing her, Morgan left her body in the bottom bunk of his cab for up to ten days while he continued to drive the lorry, driving and sleeping in it <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> of that time, before disposing of the body on 29 December. He was arrested in February 1996 after another lorry driver recognised him from a photofit. Morgan initially denied meeting her, but after he was picked out at an identity parade, he claimed he and Figard had met and engaged in consensual sex.|$|E
5|$|The second species, P. blackfeetensis, {{is based}} on a {{specimen}} in the Museum of the Rockies (MOR 454), which was described by another notable paleontologist, Jack Horner. This specimen, and the remains of three or four other individuals, were found in Glacier County, Montana. In this case, the fossils were found in a bonebed of Prosaurolophus remains, which indicates that the animals lived together <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> time. The bonebed is interpreted as reflecting a group of animals that congregated near a water source during a drought.|$|E

40|$|My goal in {{this paper}} is to see the extent to which {{judgment}} aggregation methods subsume meta-analytic ones. To this end, I derive a generalized version of the classical Condorcet Jury Theorem (CJT), the aggregative implications of which have been widely exploited in the area of rational choice theory, but not yet in philosophy of science. I contend that the generalized CJT that I prove below is useful <b>for</b> modelling <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> meta-analytic procedures...|$|R
5|$|In 1986, Richard Morris {{provided}} {{some of the}} first evidence that LTP was indeed required for the formation of memories in vivo. He tested the spatial memory of rats by pharmacologically modifying their hippocampus, a brain structure whose role in spatial learning is well established. Rats were trained on the Morris water maze, a spatial memory task in which rats swim in a pool of murky water until they locate the platform hidden beneath its surface. During this exercise, normal rats are expected to associate the location of the hidden platform with salient cues placed at specific positions around the circumference of the maze. After training, one group of rats had their hippocampi bathed in the NMDA receptor blocker APV, while the other group served as the control. Both groups were then subjected to the water maze spatial memory task. Rats in the control group were able to locate the platform and escape from the pool, while the performance of APV-treated rats was significantly impaired. Moreover, when slices of the hippocampus were taken from both groups, LTP was easily induced in controls, but could not be induced in the brains of APV-treated rats. This provided early evidence that the NMDA receptor — and by extension, LTP — was required <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> types of learning and memory.|$|E

50|$|Bach {{composed}} {{the work for}} a funeral. His motets were written {{in the tradition of}} the Evangelienmotetten (motets on gospel text) of the 17th century by composers such as Melchior Franck, Melchior Vulpius and Heinrich Schütz. When he composed his motets, works without contemporary poetry and without an independent orchestra, the genre was already out of fashion.

25|$|A {{chordate}} is {{an animal}} {{belonging to the}} phylum Chordata; they possess a notochord, a hollow dorsal nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, an endostyle, and a post-anal tail, <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> period of their life cycle. Chordates are deuterostomes, as during the embryo development stage the anus forms before the mouth. They are also bilaterally symmetric coelomates. In the case of vertebrate chordates, the notochord is usually replaced by a vertebral column during development, {{and they may have}} body plans organized by segmentation.|$|E
25|$|A common {{distinction}} between dams and weirs is that water flows {{over the top}} (crest) of a weir or underneath it <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> of its length. Accordingly, the crest of an overflow spillway on a large dam may therefore {{be referred to as}} a weir. Weirs can vary in size both horizontally and vertically, with the smallest being only a few inches in height whilst the largest may be hundreds of metres long and many metres tall. Some common weir purposes are outlined below.|$|E

25|$|A pater familias was {{the senior}} priest of his household. He offered daily cult to his lares and penates, {{and to his}} di parentes/divi parentes at his {{domestic}} shrines and in the fires of the household hearth.
