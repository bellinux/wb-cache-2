5|$|However, despite Ohio's large {{presence}} in the iron and steel market, employment rates have declined in Ohio, generally attributed to weakening national economy. Between 1998 and 2005, the number of Ohio {{iron and steel industry}} workers decreased from 52,700 to 34,000. The Ohio Department of Development predicts the decreases will continue <b>in</b> <b>coming</b> <b>years.</b> The average annual salary for iron and steel industry workers in Ohio was $59,686, compared the national industry average of $53,352.|$|E

5|$|The PV {{industry}} has seen drops in module prices since 2008. In late 2011, factory-gate prices for crystalline-silicon photovoltaic modules dropped below the $1.00/W mark. The $1.00/W installed cost, is often regarded in the PV industry as marking {{the achievement of}} grid parity for PV. These reductions have taken many stakeholders, including industry analysts, by surprise, and perceptions of current solar power economics often lags behind reality. Some stakeholders still have the perspective that solar PV remains too costly on an unsubsidized basis to compete with conventional generation options. Yet technological advancements, manufacturing process improvements, and industry re-structuring, mean that further price reductions are likely <b>in</b> <b>coming</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{coaches are}} {{primarily}} hauled by MPI MPXpress series locomotives. The current model, the 4000-horsepower MP40PH-3C, {{is more powerful}} that their predecessors, the EMD F59PH. They are capable of pulling or pushing trains of 12 coaches instead of 10. More than 60 of these locomotives have been ordered since their introduction in 2006, with a further 16 types of an even more powerful model, the MP54AC, to enter service <b>in</b> <b>coming</b> <b>years.</b> Opposite the locomotive, trains are bookended by cab cars, which are coaches with driver controls incorporated into them. While most of them closely resemble ordinary coaches, GO Transit began upgrading their rail fleet with newly designed, more crashworthy cab cars {{in the summer of}} 2015, incorporating an improved visibility, safety features and comfort for train crews.|$|E

25|$|The {{physical}} development processes {{along the coast}} are influenced by a multitude of factors, comprising wave motions, micro and macro-tidal cycles and long shore currents typical to the coastal tract. The shore currents vary greatly along with the monsoon. These are also affected by cyclonic action. Erosion and accretion through these forces maintains varying levels, as yet not properly measured, of physiographic change whilst the mangrove vegetation itself provides a remarkable stability to the entire system. During each monsoon season almost all the Bengal Delta is submerged, much of it for half a year. The sediment of the lower delta plain is primarily advected inland by monsoonal coastal setup and cyclonic events. One {{of the greatest challenges}} people living on the Ganges Delta may face <b>in</b> <b>coming</b> <b>years</b> is the threat of rising sea levels caused mostly by subsidence in the region and partly by climate change.|$|E
