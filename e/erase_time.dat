A story {{considered}} for the fourth series, it would have seen Britain under attack by an alien, who gives one of the Bannerman Road children a remote which can rewind and <b>erase</b> <b>time</b> itself.

50|$|After finding Polpo's amassed fortune {{following}} his {{death on the}} island of Capri, Bucciarati is promoted and his group is assigned a secret mission by the boss himself—escort his teenage daughter, Trish Una, safely to him. With the help of a Stand-using turtle, they fend off various attacks by Stand-using traitors within the mob, determined to overthrow the boss—only by kidnapping Trish can they hope to learn his identity. After traveling to Pompeii and Florence, they arrive in Venice to meet the boss at the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore on San Giorgio Maggiore island. However, while doing so Bucciarati discovers that the boss only wanted Trish brought to him so he could kill her himself—his intent was nothing more than to permanently conceal his identity. He alone tries to kill the Boss, in order for him and Giorno to achieve their goal, but realizes his Stand that can <b>erase</b> <b>time</b> and subsequently predict events is too powerful and decides to retreat. Bucciarati's group, minus Fugo, then join him in betraying the Boss and protect Trish so they can learn his identity. Even after Trish discovers her own Stand ability, they find themselves in the unenviable position of opposing all of the Passione gang in order to protect her.|$|E
40|$|The write/erase cycling {{endurance}} of low voltage floating-gate memory cells programmed and erased by tunneling through a SiO 2 /HfO 2 dual layer tunnel dielectric stack is investigated. The use of fixed single pulse program and erase conditions leads to fast shifting (after similar to 1000 cycles) of the threshold voltage window, {{so that only}} a limited number of write/erase cycles can be achieved. Increasing the write and erase duration quickly leads to an excessive <b>erase</b> <b>time</b> so that a different erase method has to be used. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} alternative <b>erasing</b> <b>times</b> of DenOptix (R) (Dentsply/Gendex, Chicargo, IL) digital plates oil subjective image quality and the probability of double exposure image not Occurring. Methods: Human teeth were X-rayed with phosphor plates using tell different <b>erasing</b> <b>times.</b> Two observers evaluated the images for subjective Image quality (sharpness, brightness, contrast, enamel definition, dentin definition and dentin-enamal Junction definition) and for {{the presence or absence}} of double exposure image. Spearman's correlation analysis and ANOVA was performed to verify the existence ora linear association between the subjective image quality parameters and the alternative <b>erasing</b> <b>times.</b> A contingency table was constructed to {{evaluate the}} agreement among the observers, and a binominal logistic regression was performed to verify the correlation between the <b>erasing</b> <b>time</b> and the probability of double exposure image not occurring. Results: All 6 parameters or image quality were rated high by the examiners for the <b>erasing</b> <b>times</b> between 25 s and 130 s. The same <b>erasing</b> <b>time</b> range, from 25 to 130 s, was considered a safe <b>erasing</b> <b>time</b> interval, with no probability of a double exposure image Occurring. Conclusions: The alternative <b>erasing</b> <b>times</b> from 25 s to 130 s showed high quality and no probability of double image Occurrence. Thus, it is possible to reduce the operating time or the DenOptix (R) digital system Without jeopardizing the diagnostic task.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the challenge of}} operating a reliable bit that can be rapidly erased. We find that both <b>erasing</b> and reliability <b>times</b> are non-monotonic in the underlying friction, leading to a trade-off between erasing speed and bit reliability. Fast erasure is possible {{at the expense of}} low reliability at moderate friction, and high reliability comes at the expense of slow erasure in the underdamped and overdamped limits. Within a given class of bit parameters and control strategies, we define 'optimal' designs of bits that meet the desired reliability and <b>erasing</b> <b>time</b> requirements with the lowest operational work cost. We find that optimal designs always saturate the bound on the <b>erasing</b> <b>time</b> requirement, but can exceed the required reliability time if critically damped. The non-trivial geometry of the reliability and <b>erasing</b> <b>time</b> scales allows us to exclude large regions of parameter space as suboptimal. We find that optimal designs are either critically damped or close to critical damping under the erasing procedure...|$|R
50|$|Janette {{kicked off}} her writing career working for an LDS {{publishing}} company writing romantic adult novels under the pen name Sierra St. James. She has recently acquired {{the rights to}} these books and has been re-editing and republishing them (her <b>Erasing</b> <b>Time</b> series under her pen name C.J. Hill {{is an example of}} this). In an attempt to gain a wider audience, Rallison’s publishers had her use the pen name C.J. Hill. She has written the Slayers trilogy as well as the <b>Erasing</b> <b>Time</b> series under this name. Rallison became a national author when she began writing romantic comedies for young adults, which she is most recognized for writing. The Fairy Godmother books established her as a successful author and has been one of her most popular series. Though she has started writing books filled with more action and adventure, the hallmark of Rallison’s writing is her comedic voice that permeates throughout her novels.|$|R

The materials properties required to produce updatable holograms are 100% diffraction efficiency, fast writing time, long image persistence, fast <b>erasing</b> <b>time,</b> and large area.

40|$|In this work, we {{demonstrate}} {{the feasibility of}} using channel initiated secondary electron (CHISEL) programming in high density flash memories containing fully scaled memory cells. In Part I of this work, we discussed programming performance of scaled cells and cell channel length scaling issues. In Part 11, we discuss endurance and reliability of single cells and large arrays. We demonstrate from single cell measurements that after program/erase cycling, CHISEL operation shows lower threshold voltage window closure, lower program time degradation, reduced hole trapping, and device degradation, with a marginal increase in <b>erase</b> <b>time</b> compared to conventional channel hot electron (CHE) operation. The reasons for improved reliability of CHISEL operation are explained using device simulation. CHISEL programming also shows reduced charge gain drain disturb with only slightly higher charge loss drain disturb compared to CHE operation. Measurements on large 32 -Mb array under CHISEL operation show tight threshold voltage distribution and {{more than ten years}} of data retention even after 100 -k cycling. Results are presented showing excellent reliability of CHISEL programming operation for deeply scaled high density flash EEPROMs...|$|E

A hybrid NEM-MOS circuit simulation is developed by taking account of the pull-in/pull-out operation of the suspended gate and electron tunnelling processes through the tunnel oxide layer as behavioural models.
