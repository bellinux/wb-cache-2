However, Vincent Willis' 1884 patent <b>Floating</b> <b>Lever</b> pneumatic action also had this capability.|$|R
5000|$|Various type of levers {{are used}} on the ICF Bogie [...] The typical levers being the [...] "Z" [...] <b>lever,</b> <b>floating</b> <b>lever</b> and the {{connecting}} lever. Theses levers are used to connect the brake beam with the piston of the brake cylinder. The location of the brake cylinders decides whether the bogie shall be a BMBC Bogie or a non BMBC Bogie. Conventional bogies are those ICF bogies in which the brake cylinder is {{mounted on the body}} of the coach and not placed on the bogie frame itself.|$|R

[...] "L" [...] & [...] "K" [...] types are so called since {{the shape of the}} brake blocks resembles the {{corresponding}} English alphabet letter. The third end of the brake beam has a bracket for connecting the [...] "Z" [...] & the <b>floating</b> <b>lever.</b> These levers are connected to the main frame of the bogie with the help of steel brackets. These brackets are welded to the bogie frame. L Type are low friction Composite Brake Block and K Type are high friction Composite Brake Block.|$|R

40|$|A {{growing number}} of mid-format cameras are used for aerial {{surveying}} projects. To achieve a reliable and geometrically precise result also in the photogrammetric workflow, awareness on the sensitive parts is important. The use of direct referencing systems (GPS/IMU), the mounting on a stabilizing camera platform and the specific values of the mid format camera make a professional setup with various calibration and misalignment operations necessary. An important part {{is to have a}} proper camera calibration. Using aerial images over a well designed test field with 3 D structures and/or different flight altitudes enable the determination of calibration values in Bingo software. It will be demonstrated how such a calibration can be performed. The direct referencing device must be mounted in a solid and reliable way to the camera. Beside the mechanical work especially in mounting the camera beside the IMU, 2 lever arms have to be measured in mm accuracy. Important are the lever arms from the GPS Antenna to the IMU's calibrated centre and also the lever arm from the IMU centre to the Camera projection centre. In fact, the measurement with a total station is not a difficult task but the definition of the right centres and the need for using rotation matrices can cause serious accuracy problems. The benefit of small and medium format cameras is that also smaller aircrafts can be used. Like that, a gyro bases stabilized platform is recommended. This causes, that the IMU must be mounted beside the camera on the stabilizer. The advantage is, that the IMU can be used to control the platform, the problematic thing is, that the IMU to GPS antenna <b>lever</b> arm is <b>floating.</b> In fact {{we have to deal with}} an additional data stream, the values of the movement of the stabiliser to correct the <b>floating</b> <b>lever</b> arm distances. If the post-processing of the GPS-IMU data by taking the <b>floating</b> <b>levers</b> into account, delivers an expected result, the lever arms between IMU and camera can be applied. However, there is a misalignment (bore side angle) that must be evaluated by photogrammetric process using advanced tools e. g. in Bingo. Once, all these parameters have been determined, the system is capable for projects without or with only a few ground control points. But which effect has the photogrammetric process when directly applying the achieved direct orientation values compared with an AT based on a proper tiepoint matching? The paper aims to show the steps to be done by potential users and gives a kind of quality estimation about the importance and quality influence of the various calibration and adjustment steps...|$|R
50|$|Siphons are {{sometimes}} employed as automatic machines, {{in situations where}} it is desirable to turn a continuous trickling flow or an irregular small surge flow into a large surge volume. A common {{example of this is}} a public restroom with urinals regularly flushed by an automatic siphon in a small water tank overhead. When the container is filled, all the stored liquid is released, emerging as a large surge volume that then resets and fills again. One way to do this intermittent action involves complex machinery such as <b>floats,</b> chains, <b>levers,</b> and valves, but these can corrode, wear out, or jam over time. An alternate method is with rigid pipes and chambers, using only the water itself in a siphon as the operating mechanism.|$|R
5000|$|Swan, like Ivory, was a <b>floating</b> soap, but <b>Lever</b> had {{developed}} and patented a new manufacturing method that both streamlined {{the process and}} resulted in a finer product more like milled soap. A typical advertisement boasted that Swan was [...] "the white floating soap that's purer than the finest castiles". Lever and Procter & Gamble became embroiled in litigation over the process and products of it. Lever sued Procter & Gamble for patent infringement after the format of Ivory changed; the Appellate Court found that the patent had been infringed and Procter & Gamble were required to pay $5.675 million to Lever.|$|R
5000|$|On August 19, 1939, train No 4218 was {{traveling}} east-bound with a consist of (1) combine (Halley), (1) coach (D'Arrest), one diner (Giacobini), (1) coach (Winnecki), and (1) observation car (Beila). Engine No. 820, a 4-6-2 Pacific was on point. Conductor Walsh and Engineman Thomas {{were in charge}} of the train, which was carrying 49 passengers and crew. Extraordinarily heavy rains fell in the area throughout the day. It is estimated that roughly [...] inches of rain fell, and about [...] inches fell between 2 and 6 pm. The train's crew had reduced speed from the usual 70 mph to between 35-40 mph, as visibility was poor and the crew had been given a message at Winslow Junction to keep a lookout for sand on the crossings due to the heavy rains. Near milepost 86, about a mile west of Chatsworth [...] station, the train hit a washout at 4:37 pm. The surface water had overwhelmed two 24-inch culverts, and undermined the roadbed. The engine and tender made it across the damaged track, with the rear tender truck being derailed. The rear truck <b>floating</b> <b>lever</b> was damaged, rendering the tender brakes inoperative. The entire 5-car consist, however, had become uncoupled from the tender and derailed. [...] The cars came to rest in general line with the track, and were leaning at various angles. Roughly 500 feet of track was destroyed. When the train failed to arrive at Chatsworth Station, personnel and local residents waded over a mile through the woods in water waist deep in parts to reach the wreck. Reports that one hundred people were killed led to a flurry of ambulances from northern parts of the state. Actually, only forty-nine people were on board. The injured included 32 passengers, 4 dining car employees, 1 porter, and 1 train service employee. The chef, Joseph Coleman, was crushed and badly scalded in the kitchen of the dining car when the stove fell on top of him as the car overturned. He later died from his injuries. [...] The majority of the injuries were minor, resulting from the flying wicker chairs in the observation car. CNJ crews replaced about six hundred feet of damaged track in approximately forty-eight hours. A relief train arrived a few hours later to take the remaining passengers. An investigation concluded that the derailment was caused by the washout which resulted from the unusually heavy rainfall. Today, the mainline track and wreck site are abandoned and very overgrown.|$|R
40|$|Access {{to clean}} {{water is a}} human right that is {{unattainable}} by many people. The Agua Clara project is working to design and build water treatment plants in Honduras, which is among the poorest countries in the world. Major {{emphasis is placed on}} the integration of the plants into the communities effectively. Careful consideration is made regarding the specific requirements for each community. In the neighborhoods with the greatest need for water purification technologies there is often an intermittent flow of electricity. Current water treatment designs control chemical dosing and flow rates with electrically powered pumps and sensors. The intermittent electricity supply combined with the current system design would result in intermittent supply of ?treated water,? water sent intermittently through pipelines is no longer considered pure because during shut-down the pipelines will form a vacuum pressure pulling surrounding material into the pipe space contaminating future water flows. The Agua Clara design requires no input of electricity for operation of the plant. Water flows through the plant from high elevation to low elevation; elevation change is the energy source for the water treatment. The water is treated through 4 processes. The first step in water treatment is a grit chamber which removes the large objects such as branches from the water flow using a large spacing metal grid. Water is then treated with a coagulant, aluminum hydroxide, and sent through a flocculation tank. The coagulant binds to the foreign particles (contaminants) in the water and creates flocs, similar to a snowflake. The flocs increase in size as they move through the flocculation tank. Sedimentation follows the flocculation stage, the large flocs are settled out and the clean water is drawn of the top of the sedimentation tank. As a final measure the purified water is treated with chlorine to kill any bacteria remaining the water and provide a residual chlorine concentration for disinfection during transport. My research is focused on the dosing of aluminum hydroxide to the water. Currently the operator of the plant manually adjusts the flow rate of aluminum hydroxide as the flow rate through the treatment plant changes. Automation of the process is required to more rapidly and reliably meter alum to the inflow. The automation process is designed using an entrance tank, riser pipe, and float system. The contaminated water flows into the entrance tank the through a riser pipe and then empties into the flocculation tank. A system of <b>floats</b> and <b>lever</b> arms change the flow rate of alum based on the height of the water in the entrance tank. The height of water in the entrance tank is based on the outflow of water through orifices in a riser pipe located in the entrance tank. The height in the water in the entrance tank with a single outflow orifice is correlated to the square root of the flow rate according to the orifice equation. This relationship makes metering aluminum hydroxide through a float system nearly impossible. Linearization of the head of the water in the entrance tank as a function of flow rate is the goal of my project. If the pattern of orifices on the riser pipe can be situated to create a linear relationship between water height in the entrance tank and the flow rate through the plant then the float system can easily adjust the alum flow rate...|$|R
40|$|Beside the {{creation}} of virtual animated 3 D City models, analysis for homeland security and city planning, the accurately determination of geometric features out of oblique imagery is an important task today. Due to the huge number of single images the reduction of control points force {{to make use of}} direct referencing devices. This causes a precise camera-calibration and additional adjustment procedures. This paper aims to show the workflow of the various calibration steps and will present examples of the calibration flight with the final 3 D City model. In difference to most other software, the oblique cameras are used not as co-registered sensors in relation to the nadir one, all camera images enter the AT process as single pre-oriented data. This enables a better post calibration in order to detect variations in the single camera calibration and other mechanical effects. The shown sensor (Oblique Imager) is based o 5 Phase One cameras were the nadir one has 80 MPIX equipped with a 50 mm lens while the oblique ones capture images with 50 MPix using 80 mm lenses. The cameras are mounted robust inside a housing to protect this against physical and thermal deformations. The sensor head hosts also an IMU which is connected to a POS AV GNSS Receiver. The sensor is stabilized by a gyro-mount which creates <b>floating</b> Antenna –IMU <b>lever</b> arms. They had to be registered together with the Raw GNSS-IMU Data. The camera calibration procedure was performed based on a special calibration flight with 351 shoots of all 5 cameras and registered the GPS/IMU data. This specific mission was designed in two different altitudes with additional cross lines on each flying heights. The five images from each exposure positions have no overlaps but in the block there are many overlaps resulting in up to 200 measurements per points. On each photo there were in average 110 well distributed measured points which is a satisfying number for the camera calibration. In a first step {{with the help of the}} nadir camera and the GPS/IMU data, an initial orientation correction and radial correction were calculated. With this approach, the whole project was calculated and calibrated in one step. During the iteration process the radial and tangential parameters were switched on individually for the camera heads and after that the camera constants and principal point positions were checked and finally calibrated. Besides that, the bore side calibration can be performed either on basis of the nadir camera and their offsets, or independently for each camera without correlation to the others. This must be performed in a complete mission anyway to get stability between the single camera heads. Determining the lever arms of the nodal-points to the IMU centre needs more caution than for a single camera especially due to the strong tilt angle. Prepared all these previous steps, you get a highly accurate sensor that enables a fully automated data extraction with a rapid update of you existing data. Frequently monitoring urban dynamics is then possible in fully 3 D environment...|$|R
