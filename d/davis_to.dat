5|$|On November 21, 1861, Johnson wrote Confederate {{president}} Jefferson <b>Davis</b> <b>to</b> request Kentucky's {{admission to}} the Confederacy.

5|$|The {{convention}} {{passed an}} ordinance of secession {{and established a}} provisional Confederate government for Kentucky. Burnett, William Preston of Fayette County and William E.

For reasons unexplained by the delegates, Dr. Luke P. Blackburn, a native Kentuckian living in Mississippi, was invited to accompany the commissioners.

Brown also worked out with the New York Giants earlier in September and with the Houston Texans in October.|$|E
5|$|Black Beauty was {{recorded}} on April 10, 1970, at the Fillmore West in San Francisco, when Davis performed as the opening act for the Grateful Dead. It was also {{soon after his}} studio album Bitches Brew had been released to stores, and he played some songs from the album while leading an ensemble that featured soprano saxophonist Steve Grossman, bassist Dave Holland, keyboardist Chick Corea, drummer Jack DeJohnette, and percussionist Airto Moreira.

Apart from those two trades, nine further draft-day trades were announced.|$|E
5|$|Warwick Davis as Nikabrik, a black dwarf. He is {{descendant}} of Ginarrbrik, who served the White Witch, and bears {{one of his}} rings, which was passed down from each generation. Mark Johnson acknowledged casting Davis as the treacherous Nikabrik was casting against type: Berger covered all his face bar his eyelids in prosthetics, to allow <b>Davis</b> <b>to</b> ward off the audience's perceptions of him. Nikabrik's nose was based on Berger. Davis feared filming in the Czech Republic, because the grass is filled with ticks, so he put elastic bands to hold his trousers against his legs. Davis portrayed Reepicheep in the 1989 BBC production of Prince Caspian.|$|E
5|$|Werber {{imposed a}} stern {{training}} regimen on Guard, Shane, and Reynolds, rehearsing them for {{six to eight}} hours a day for several months, sending them to prominent San Francisco vocal coach Judy <b>Davis</b> <b>to</b> help them learn to preserve their voices, and working on the group's carefully prepared but apparently spontaneous banter between songs. At the same time, the group was developing a varied and eclectic repertoire of calypso, folk, and foreign language songs, suggested by all three of the musicians though usually arranged by Guard with some harmonies created by Reynolds.|$|E

5|$|Before Korn was formed, {{three of}} the {{original}} members of the band {{were associated with the}} band L.A.P.D. – James Shaffer, Reginald Arvizu, and David Silveria. Originally consisting of Richard Morrill, James Shaffer, and Reginald Arvizu, David Silveria joined when he was 16. When the band moved from Bakersfield, California to Los Angeles, Silveria {{dropped out of high school}} and Shaffer stayed in Bakersfield. When Shaffer reunited with the band, they found a manager and released an EP entitled Love and Peace Dude in 1989 through Triple X Records. L.A.P.D. released their first full-length studio album on May 3, 1991 which consisted of eleven tracks. The album was entitled Who's Laughing Now. After releasing two albums, L.A.P.D. broke up. They were also briefly known as Creep, recording a demo with a singer named Corey until Shaffer, Arvizu, and Silveria enlisted Brian Welch and Jonathan <b>Davis</b> <b>to</b> form the band that went on to become Korn.|$|E
5|$|Davis {{began the}} 2013–14 {{season in the}} {{starting}} eleven under yet another new manager, Kenny Jackett, but soon lost his place amid competition from new signing Kevin McDonald and two younger midfielders, Lee Evans and Jack Price. On his last start for Wolves, on 16 November, he was reportedly fortunate not to be sent off before being substituted at half-time. Thereafter he played only 54 minutes of first-team football as the team were promoted back to the Championship at the first attempt, and although Jackett insisted that {{he still had a}} future at the club, Davis became frustrated. Ahead of the new season, Jackett suggested that, as there were at least four players more likely than <b>Davis</b> <b>to</b> be selected, a loan move would be best for him. Barnsley of League One were interested, but terms could not be agreed.|$|E
5|$|In 1983 and 1987, Davis made {{unsuccessful}} {{requests for}} all of the chapter house stones. After the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the de Young museum was to be rebuilt, {{and the future of the}} stones was reconsidered. In September 1993, museum director Harry Parker joined with <b>Davis</b> <b>to</b> sign an unconditional permanent loan of the chapter house stones to New Clairvaux. In 1994, the city approved the loan with the stipulation that the building be restored accurately and that it be occasionally open to the public. The stones were transported in 20 truckloads to Vina. Inside an old brick barn built by Stanford to make brandy, the stones began to be fitted together, laid flat on Burke's plywood templates.|$|E
50|$|On November 25, 2006, <b>Davis</b> {{was traded}} <b>to</b> the Arizona Diamondbacks along with pitcher Dana Eveland and outfielder Dave Krynzel, for catcher Johnny Estrada, and {{pitchers}} Greg Aquino and Claudio Vargas.

50|$|The case of Parker v.
