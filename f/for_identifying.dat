Distillation column process is taken for studies.

In particular, the study of elliptic flow (υ 2) <b>for</b> <b>identified</b> particles can be used to constrain the initial conditions and the value of shear viscosity over entropy density ratio. It also allows to determine the role of the hadronic rescattering phase in the development of flow.

5|$|A major {{point of}} {{consensus}} among all scholars of intellectual giftedness {{is that there}} is no generally agreed definition of giftedness. Although there is no scholarly agreement about identifying gifted learners, there is a de facto reliance on IQ scores <b>for</b> <b>identifying</b> participants in school gifted education programs. In practice, many school districts in the United States use an IQ score of 130, including about the upper 2 or 3 percent of the national population, as a cut-off score for inclusion in school gifted programs.|$|E

Clergy in Anglican, Lutheran, Eastern Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches follow similar customs, as do institutions such as schools and dioceses.|$|E

5|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a rise in cases of {{undisclosed}} synthetic diamond melee being found in set jewelry and within diamond parcels sold in the trade. Due to the relatively inexpensive cost of diamond melee, as well as relative lack of universal knowledge <b>for</b> <b>identifying</b> large quantities of melee efficiently, not all dealers have made an effort to test diamond melee to correctly identify whether it is of natural or man-made origin. However, international laboratories are now beginning to tackle the issue head-on, with significant improvements in synthetic melee identification being made.|$|E
5|$|Krause {{and colleagues}} wrote {{that these two}} teeth {{resemble}} multituberculate deciduous anterior upper premolars, particularly second and third premolars (P2 and P3), and used this {{as one of their}} arguments <b>for</b> <b>identifying</b> Ferugliotherium as a multituberculate. However, as with the dentary MACN Pv-RN 975, the two upper premolars were excluded from Ferugliotherium and identified as multituberculates by Kielan-Jaworowska and colleagues after the discovery of the jaw of Sudamerica. Gurovich continues to identify them as Ferugliotherium {{on the basis of their}} size and provenance and other similarities between Ferugliotherium and multituberculates.|$|E

5|$|Several methods <b>for</b> <b>identifying</b> {{synthetic}} diamonds can be performed, {{depending on}} the method of production {{and the color of}} the diamond. CVD diamonds can usually be identified by an orange fluorescence. D-J colored diamonds can be screened through the Swiss Gemmological Institute's Diamond Spotter. Stones in the D-Z color range can be examined through the DiamondSure UV/visible spectrometer, a tool developed by De Beers. Similarly, natural diamonds usually have minor imperfections and flaws, such as inclusions of foreign material, that are not seen in synthetic diamonds.|$|E
5|$|The spores of Myxogastria are haploid, mainly {{round and}} measure between 5µm and 20µm, rarely up to 24µm in diameter. Their surface is {{generally}} reticular, sharp, warty or spiky and very rarely smooth. The typical colour of the spore mass becomes {{visible through the}} structure, since the spores themselves are not pigmented. In some species, especially of the genus Badhamia, the spores produce lumps. The colour, shape and diameter of spores are important characteristics <b>for</b> <b>identifying</b> species.|$|E
5|$|Another aspect {{that the}} GAO {{investigation}} revealed {{was that the}} training F-15 pilots received <b>for</b> <b>identifying</b> helicopters was not adequate. Visual ID training was accomplished by reviewing slides on a 35mm projector. Helicopters only made up about 5% of the training slides and nearly all the pictures depicted helicopters from the ground looking up because the pictures were provided by the U.S. Army. Investigators also learned from interviewing other F-15 pilots that helicopter recognition was not regarded as an important skill within the F-15 pilot community because helicopters are not considered a threat to F-15s in air-to-air combat.|$|E

5|$|Hobgood et al. {{argue that}} one key {{component}} in equipping nations to develop emergency medical systems {{is to identify}} the aspects of training that are essential for health care providers. In their view, a standard curriculum is useful <b>for</b> <b>identifying</b> core issues, even if countries have very different needs and resources. To address this goal, the International Federation for Emergency Medicine developed a model curriculum in 2009. This initiative seeks to provide a minimum basic standard that can be tailored to {{the specific needs of}} the various nations implementing training in emergency medicine. It is targeted towards all medical students in order to produce a minimum competency in emergency care for all physicians, regardless of their specialty.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Aston {{teamed up}} with {{television}} producer Tim Taylor and together they created two shows which focused on bringing archaeology into British popular consciousness.

Aston was responsible <b>for</b> <b>identifying</b> sites for excavation and for selecting specialists to appear on the show, and through the programme became well known to the viewing public for his trademark colourful jumpers and flowing, untidy hairstyle. In 1996 he was appointed to the specially-created post of Professor of Landscape Archaeology at Bristol University, and undertook a ten-year project investigating the manor at Shapwick, Somerset.|$|E
5|$|Lead(II) {{compounds}} {{are characteristic}} of the inorganic chemistry of lead. Even strong oxidizing agents like fluorine and chlorine react with lead to give only PbF2 and PbCl2. Lead(II) ions are usually colorless in solution, and partially hydrolyze to form Pb(OH)+ and finally Pb4(OH)4 (in which the hydroxyl ions act as bridging ligands), but are not reducing agents as tin(II) ions are. Techniques <b>for</b> <b>identifying</b> {{the presence of the}} Pb2+ ion in water generally rely on the precipitation of lead(II) chloride using dilute hydrochloric acid. As the chloride salt is somewhat soluble in water, the precipitation of lead(II) sulfide, by bubbling hydrogen sulfide through the solution, is then attempted.|$|E

5|$|Scientists once {{believed}} that the distinct status of some subspecies could be justified by morphology, including {{the size of the}} mane. Morphology was used to identify subspecies such as the Barbary lion and Cape lion, which had the thickest, most extensive manes amongst wild lions. Research results indicate that environmental factors such as average ambient temperature influence the colour and size of a lion's mane. The cooler ambient temperature in European and North American zoos, for example, may result in a heavier mane. Thus the mane is not an appropriate marker <b>for</b> <b>identifying</b> subspecies. The males of the Asiatic subspecies, however, are characterised by sparser manes than average African lions.|$|E
