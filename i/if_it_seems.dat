5|$|The {{claim that}} all humans are due {{dignity and respect}} as {{autonomous}} agents means that medical professionals should be happy for their treatments to be performed on anyone and that patients must never be treated merely as useful for society. Kant's approach to sexual ethics emerged from his view that humans should never be used merely {{as a means to}} an end, leading him to regard sexual activity as degrading and to condemn certain specific sexual practices - for example, extramarital sex. Feminist philosophers have used Kantian ethics to condemn practices such as prostitution and pornography because they treat women as ends. Kant also believed that, because animals do not possess rationality, we cannot have duties to them except indirect duties not to develop immoral dispositions through cruelty towards them. Kant used the example of lying as an application of his ethics: because there is a perfect duty to tell the truth, we must never lie, even <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> that lying would bring about better consequences than telling the truth.|$|E

25|$|Aurelian's reign {{records the}} only {{uprising}} of mint workers. The rationalis Felicissimus, a senior public financial official whose responsibilities included {{supervision of the}} mint at Rome, revolted against Aurelian. The revolt {{seems to have been}} caused {{by the fact that the}} mint workers, and Felicissimus first, were accustomed to stealing the silver for the coins and producing coins of inferior quality. Aurelian wanted to eliminate this, and put Felicissimus on trial. The rationalis incited the mintworkers to revolt: the rebellion spread in the streets, even <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> that Felicissimus was killed immediately, presumably executed.|$|E
500|$|The {{analogy of}} games– most {{commonly}} associated with Ludwig Wittgenstein– has been proposed {{as a way of}} establishing meaning in religious language. The theory asserts that language must be understood in terms of a game: just as each game has its own rules determining what can and cannot be done, so each context of language has its own rules determining what is and is not meaningful. Religion is classified as a possible and legitimate language game which is meaningful within its own context. Various parables have also been proposed {{to solve the problem of}} meaning in religious language. R. M. Hare used his parable of a lunatic to introduce the concept of [...] "bliks"– unfalsifiable beliefs according to which a worldview is established– which are not necessarily meaningless. Basil Mitchell used a parable to show that faith can be logical, even <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> unverifiable. John Hick used his parable of the Celestial City to propose his theory of eschatological verification, the view that if there is an afterlife, then religious statements will be verifiable after death.|$|E
500|$|To create {{tracks on}} Let the Blind Lead, Cox {{continually}} adds elements to a song until he [...] "feel like it's getting crowded…When it sounds done, it's done. And <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> like it's missing something, I'll {{go back and}} add something." [...] Most of his music {{is the product of}} several hours' work, rather than that of a few days. [...] To Pitchfork Media Cox said that, with each song, [...] "The genesis is usually a beat." [...] Cox considers the music of Let the Blind Lead to have a [...] "dynamic arc": {{the first half of the}} record contains [...] "more accessible songs. I was very depressed in the middle, and it created this kind of black hole of misery. Then I tried to bring it up again at the end." [...] Cox intended for his music to be [...] "therapeutic", for both himself and his audience. [...] In addition, he wanted the album to have a healing element, and be something [...] "somebody could listen to all the way through and feel like they went through a bad period of time and came out of it." [...] Pauline Oliveros, a composer who runs an organization that studies music therapy, was described by Cox as having [...] "a big influence" [...] on him and his ideas of therapeutic music. [...] He considers music [...] "the only art form I know of that has such an immediate effect on the human psyche", and found the time he first met and talked with Oliveros as being [...] "like meeting a hero of mine." ...|$|E

2500|$|Stalemate {{has become}} a widely used metaphor for other {{situations}} {{where there is a}} conflict or contest between two parties, such as war or political negotiations, and neither side is able to achieve victory, resulting in what is also called an impasse, a deadlock, or a Mexican standoff.

2500|$|Following the {{favorable}} attitude of some Franciscan theologians to this truth, Llull's {{position on this}} subject was of great importance because it {{paved the way for}} the doctrine of Duns Scotus, whom he met in 1297, after which he was given the nickname Doctor Illuminatus, even <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> that he had not direct influence on him.

2500|$|It {{appears to}} connect with the more southerly {{oriented}} right-lateral Rattlesnake Mountain Fault Zone (RMFZ) straddling Rattlesnake Mountain (near North Bend), which shows a similar deep-seated contact between different kinds of basement rock. At the southern end of Rattlesnake Mountain ndash& exactly where the first lineament of the OWL is encountered ndash& at least one strand of the RMFZ (the others are hidden) turns to run by Cedar Falls and up the Cedar River. [...] Other faults to the south also show a similar turn, suggesting a general turning or bending across the OWL, yet such a bend is not apparent in the pattern of physiographic features that express the OWL. [...] With awareness that the Seattle Fault and the RMFZ are the edges of a large sheet of material which is moving north, there is a distinct impression that these faults, and even some of the topographical features, are flowing {{around the corner of the}} Snoqualmie Valley. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> odd that a mountain should [...] "float" [...] around a valley: bear in mind that while the surface relief is about three-quarters of a kilometer (half a mile) in height, the material flowing could be as much as eighteen kilometers deep. [...] (The analogy of icebergs moving around a submerged sandbar is quite apt.) [...] It is worth noting that [...] ndash& a minor prominence just east of Cedar Falls ndash& is the southwestern-most exposure in the region of some very old Cretaceaous (pre-Cenozoic) metamorphic rock. It seems quite plausible that there is some well-founded and obdurate obstruction at depth, around which the shallower and younger sedimentary formations are flowing. [...] In such a context the observed arcuate fault bends would be very natural.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{conflicting}} {{views about}} student participation in extracurricular activities. A predominant {{position is that}} colleges were after [...] "well-rounded bodies of individual specialists", suggesting {{that it is better}} for a student to be deeply involved in one or two activities rather than nine or ten superficially, such as a [...] "violin-playing quarterback" [...] or a [...] "math-medalist poet," [...] and that students should not [...] "overdo it" [...] and that parents should not become overconcerned about their child's extracurricular activities. Applicants who achieve a leadership position in an extracurricular activity are regarded more highly than applicants who merely participate in a bunch of activities. Advisors recommend that a student should choose which extracurricular activities they genuinely care about, pursue them with [...] "gusto" [...] and [...] "joyful commitment" [...] that demonstrates integrity and commitment. And, consistent with this view, is that too many extracurricular activities may look suspect to admissions officers, particularly <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> unreasonable that any person could be as active and succeed scholastically at the same time. Jobs are generally viewed favorably by admissions committees, including even part-time service jobs such as flipping hamburgers, since it suggests that a student has learned to handle time management, to accept responsibility, and develop people skills. A less dominant position was that it is helpful to be involved in a [...] "variety of activities", including jobs, internships, and community service. Some universities, such as the University of California, have formal programs for spot-checking applications for accuracy, such as sending a follow-up letter to the student asking for proof about an extracurricular activity or summer job. Advisors recommend that extracurricular activities should never interfere with a student's overall academic performance. A student with many extracurricular activities in twelfth grade, but few in preceding years, particularly when the essays focus on the extracurricular activities, is suspect; this suggests an applicant is being coached, and may reflect negatively on an application. Advisors warn against [...] "overscheduling" [...] students with too many activities or courses.|$|E
