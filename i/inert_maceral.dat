40|$|Highveld parent coal {{was crushed}} into three size fractions, namely: 5 mm– 75 mm, 5 mm– 53 mm, and 5 – 37. 5 mm. The crushed samples were {{subjected}} as feed coals to heating in a packed-bed reactor {{to investigate the}} influence of particle size reduction on char formation and reactivity. Coal petrography was utilized to assess the maceral and char formation distribution of the feed coal samples and their packed-bed combustion unit’s products. The maceral distribution of the feed coal fractions differed from the typical run-of-mine Highveld coal petrographic composition; the smallest size fractions (53 mm and 37. 5 mm) having the highest vitrinite content. Maceral distribution was further divided into total reactive maceral particles, total <b>inert</b> <b>maceral</b> particles, and total inertinite particles. The 53 mm and 37. 5 mm feed coal samples had the highest total reactive maceral particle content. Inert char particles dominated in the packed-bed combustion unit samples due to high inertinite maceral group content of the Highveld coals. Unexpectedly, the 53 mm feed coal sample had higher content of total reactive maceral particles and lower content of total <b>inert</b> <b>maceral</b> particles; whereas the 37. 5 mm feed coal sample had high content of reactive maceral particles and high content of total <b>inert</b> <b>maceral</b> particles. This variation in maceral group content lead to the 53 mm feed coal sample being more reactive (producing more devolatilized and porous chars and thus reacting faster with reactant gases) than the 37. 5 mm feed coal sample. This was due to <b>inert</b> <b>maceral</b> particles restricting the 37. 5 mm feed coal sample from fully softening and reacting with reactant gas. This was also this was attributed to variation in volatile propagation of the three particle sizes. This confirms that a feed coal with smaller particle sizes results in different reactivity, char formation, and better heat transfer during combustion than the feed coal with large particle size range. Another important factor that {{plays a role in}} combustion is maceral association; it was observed that maceral distribution has a great influence on the char formation and its reactivity more than coal particle size.

40|$|A pilot oven {{produced}} coke {{with the}} addition of 7. 5 wt% charcoal (bio-coke) and the similarly produced base blend coke were subjected to gasification and annealing under the simulated blast furnace conditions. The effect of charcoal addition on the coke properties after gasification and annealing was characterised using Raman spectroscopy, ultra-micro indentation and tensile testing. The addition of charcoal significantly increased the coke reactivity with CO 2 {{as a result of its}} increased surface area by charcoal. The addition of charcoal made no further contribution to the devolatilisation or mineral reactions of coke during annealing. The charcoal particles were well preserved after annealing at 2273 K, but preferentially consumed in the gasification. Annealing temperature had less effect on the graphitisation of the charcoal component compared to the coexisting <b>inert</b> <b>maceral</b> derived component (IMDC) and reactive maceral derived component (RMDC). The charcoal addition had no effect on the microstructure and microstrength of coexisting microtextural types during annealing and gasification. The charcoal presented a higher resistance to fracture than IMDC and RMDC under annealing conditions. The addition of charcoal did not deteriorate the coke resistance to strength degradation under the thermal load of blast furnace. However, charcoal addition caused more severe degradation by gasification as demonstrated by more reduction in the tensile strength of the bio-coke. This was attributed to the preferential solution loss reaction of the charcoal particles leaving voids which coalesced the pores in coke, thereby increasing the defects that cause stress concentration under loading...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to determine the}} applicability of the random pore model with intraparticle diffusion for the determination of the reaction kinetics for the combustion of chars particles derived from coals rich in minerals and inertinites. The char particles which were pyrolysed at 900 degrees C consisted of a dense carbon-containing fraction originating from the <b>inert</b> <b>macerals</b> (mainly inertinites), a high concentration of minerals and carbominerites, pores generated by the devolatilisation of the reactive macerals and cracks {{as a result of the}} presence of minerals. Combustion experimentation was carried out with a thermogravimetric analyser using 1 mm particles with 20 % (mole) oxygen in nitrogen at 287. 5 kPa and low temperatures (450 - 600 degrees C) and with high gas flow rates. The random pore model with intraparticle diffusion (pores and cracks) was solved numerically according to a method consisting of a step-wise regression procedure. This was achieved by using carbon conversion and reduced time relationships to calculate the structural parameter and the initial Thiele modulus followed by determination of an initial lumped reaction rate and validation with conversion versus real time results. The model is characterised by a decreasing Thiele modulus (increasing porosity) occurring during the reaction period which gives rise to a transition to a chemically controlled reaction system. It was found that the initial overall reaction rate was controlled by intraparticle diffusion with an increasing influence with increasing temperature. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
