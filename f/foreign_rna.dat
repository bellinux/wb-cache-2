40|$|Hammerhead ribozymes {{are small}} {{catalytic}} RNA molecules {{that can be}} designed to specifically cleave other RNAs. These ribozymes have exhibited low efficiency when examined inside cells, perhaps {{in part because of}} their sensitivity to intracellular RNases. In an effort to better understand intracellular degradation of small, <b>foreign</b> <b>RNAs</b> and to develop more stable ribozymes, the ability of Escherichia coli RNase mutants to digest ribozymes was examined. In soluble extracts, most (80 to 90 %) of the endonucleolytic activity was due to RNases I and I*, since degradative activity was inhibited by Mg 2 + and by the rna- 2 mutation. Degradation by exonucleolytic activities was temperature sensitive in extracts from an rna pnp rnb(Ts) triple mutant but not in extracts from an rna rnb(Ts) double mutant. Thus, the products of rnb and pnp, RNase II and polynucleotide phosphorylase, respectively, appear to be the major exonucleases that degrade hammerhead ribozymes. Examination of intracellular degradation revealed that RNases I and I* contributed to about half of the degradative activity as judged by comparison of the rate of ribozyme decay in wild-type and rna- 2 mutant cells. Little additional effect was observed in rne(RNase E) and rnc (RNaseIII) mutants.

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: RNA {{interference}} {{is a type}} of nucleic-acid-based immunity used by {{cells to}} restrict transposons, transgenes and viruses. The RNA interference machinery targets long double-stranded RNAs to produce short RNAs that arm cellular ribonucleases to degrade <b>foreign</b> <b>RNAs</b> in a sequence-specific manner. Despite this defense, many viruses with RNA genomes, such as HIV- 1, replicate seemingly unrestricted in cells. This suggests that viruses may have evolved counter-strategems that negate the host's RNA interference. We review the complex point-counterpoint RNA interference interplays between the human cells and HIV- 1. RECENT FINDINGS: RNA interference functions in human cells to restrict viral replication. Recent findings suggest that HIV- 1 can evade cellular RNA interference in several ways. First, the virus can mutate its sequence to evade sequence-specific targeting by RNA interference. Second, HIV- 1 encodes a viral Tat protein that can partially suppress the cell's RNA interference processing machinery. Finally, HIV- 1 encodes a small RNA decoy, TAR, which can sequester a cellular protein named TAR RNA binding protein. The recent discovery that TAR RNA binding protein is a required cofactor for Dicer to process microRNA and small interfering RNA suggests that TAR RNA is another moiety used by HIV- 1 to defeat RNA interference.

50|$|The next {{scientific}} {{focus was}} on immune sensing of RNA in the cytosol of cells. It turned out that this sensing pathway is related to RNA interference (siRNA, microRNA). In RNA interference, the helicase DICER cleaves longer double-stranded RNA molecules into shorter siRNA or microRNA which are then integrated into the RISC complex. The antisense strand within this RISC complex {{is responsible for the}} sequence specificity of silencing of the corresponding target mRNA. In more primitive organisms such as worms RNA interference is used to destroy foreign nucleic acids. This defense mechanism can be regarded as a specific form of a nucleic acid-based immune system in which the newly generated siRNAs function as immune effector molecules. In higher organisms such as vertebrates, this DICER-based defense system is replaced by another defense mechanism. Two helicases related to DICER, RIG-I and MDA5, take over the challenge to detect <b>foreign</b> <b>RNA</b> in the cytosol of cells. However, unlike the helicase DICER, upon recognition of <b>foreign</b> <b>RNA</b> RIG-I and MDA5 trigger a broad spectrum of antiviral activities in the cell including type I IFN.

However, little is known about how MAVS is regulated in response to <b>foreign</b> <b>RNA,</b> including both single-stranded (ss) and double-stranded (ds) RNA, because most previous reports have shown that the cleavage of MAVS is executed by proteases that are induced or activated by the invading RNA viruses.

RIG-I detects and binds to <b>foreign</b> duplex <b>RNA</b> in the cytoplasm of both immune and non-immune cells, and initiates the induction of type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines. The mechanism of RIG-I activation by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) involves a molecular rearran-gement proposed to expose the N-terminal pair of caspase activation recruitment domains, enabling an interaction with interferon-beta promoter stimulator 1 (IPS- 1) and thereby initiating down-stream signalling. dsRNA is particularly stimulatory when longer than 20 bp, potentially through allowing binding of more than one RIG-I molecule.

Little is known about mosquito responses to viral infection, and how these responses could be utilised to prevent spread of viral disease. Anopheles gambiae, the principal vector of human malaria, unusually transmits virtually no arboviruses, with one known exception - O’nyony-nyong Virus (ONNV). In this thesis the interactions between ONNV and the A. gambiae immune system were studied. Initially ONNV infection in A. gambiae mosquitoes and an A. gambiae derived cell line were characterised. The in vivo transcriptional responses of A. gambiae to viral infection were profiled using full genome microarrays, describing the global response to ONNV infection. This thesis demonstrates that the A. gambiae immune system does respond to viral infection, with genes covering all aspects of immunity being differentially regulated, from pathogen recognition to modulation of immune signalling, complement-mediated lysis/opsonisation and immune effector mechanisms. Furthermore, this study identified four immune genes (a galectin, an MD 2 -like receptor and two lysozymes) regulated by ONNV infection that are capable of limiting virus during infection. These genes have novel roles in anti-viral immunity, and suggest previously uncharacterised mechanisms for targeting viral infection. Additionally, it is shown that A. gambiae uses a combination of core conserved anti-viral mechanisms, including RNAi, but does not utilise some signalling pathways reported to be anti-viral in other insects.

This paper describes an optimized protocol for single-cell qPCR measurements in primary pituitary cell cultures following patch-clamp recordings. Two different cell harvesting methods were assessed using both the GH 4 prolactin producing cell line from rat, and primary cell culture from fish pituitaries. Results Harvesting whole cells followed by cell lysis and qPCR performed satisfactory on the GH 4 cell line. However, harvesting of whole cells from primary pituitary cultures regularly produced false positives, probably due to RNA leakage from cells ruptured during the dispersion of the pituitary cells. To reduce RNA contamination affecting the results, we optimized the conditions by harvesting only the cytosol through a patch pipette, subsequent to electrophysiological experiments. Two important factors proved crucial for reliable harvesting. First, silanizing the patch pipette glass prevented <b>foreign</b> extracellular <b>RNA</b> from attaching to charged residues on the glass surface. Second, substituting the commonly used perforating antibiotic amphotericin B with β-escin allowed efficient cytosol harvest without loosing the giga seal. Importantly, the two harvesting protocols revealed no difference in RNA isolation efficiency. Conclusion Depending on the cell type and preparation, validation of the harvesting technique is extremely important as contaminations may give false positives.

It exhibited both endo- and exonuclease activities in an Ni 2 + or Mn 2 +-dependent manner.

Particularly, the glands increase in size, express metalloproteinases and display apoptotic markers. This leads to a strong cellular response, which has many hallmarks of the granuloma-like encapsulation reaction, usually mounted by the insect against larger <b>foreign</b> objects. <b>RNA</b> sequencing of the fat body reveals a characteristic humoral immune response. In addition we also identify genes that are specifically induced upon expression of RasV 12. As a proof-of-principle, we show that one of the induced genes (santa-maria), which encodes a scavenger receptor, modulates damage to the salivary glands. The list of genes we have identified provides a rich source for further functional characterization. Our hope is that this will lead {{to a better understanding of}} the earliest stage of innate immune responses against tumors with implications for mammalian immunity...|$|R
