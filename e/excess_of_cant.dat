50|$|Cant {{gradient}} is {{the amount}} by which cant is increased or decreased in a given length of track. The change in cant is {{required in order to}} connect a tangent track (no cant) to a curved track (with cant) through a transition curve. The rate <b>of</b> change <b>of</b> <b>cant</b> is used to determine the suitable cant gradient for a given design speed. Track twist may also be used to describe cant gradient which may be expressed in percentage <b>of</b> <b>cant</b> change per length unit. However, in the UK, the term track twist is normally used in the context <b>of</b> <b>cant</b> gradient with higher values which are considered to be faults.|$|R

40|$|The Southern Ocean, where various water masses {{are formed}} (mode, intermediate, deep, and bottom waters), {{has a high}} {{potential}} to absorb anthropogenic CO 2 (Cant). However, most data-based and model estimates indicate low <b>Cant</b> inventories south <b>of</b> 50 °S. In order to investigate this paradox, the distribution <b>of</b> <b>Cant</b> is estimated between South Africa and Antarctica (World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) line I 6) based on a back-calculation technique previously used in the North Atlantic (Körtzinger et al., 1998) and adapted here for application in the Southern Ocean. At midlatitudes (30 °- 50 °S), formation and spreading of mode and intermediate waters results in a deep penetration <b>of</b> <b>Cant</b> (down to 2000 m). South of 50 °S, significant concentrations <b>of</b> <b>Cant</b> were estimated in Circumpolar Deep Water (> 10 μmol/kg) and Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) (20 - 25 μmol/kg). Higher concentrations are detected along the continental slope in AABW presumably formed in Prydz Bay compared to AABW of Weddell Sea origin. The distribution <b>of</b> <b>Cant</b> obtained north <b>of</b> 50 °S compares well with previous data-based and model estimates, but large disagreements {{are found in the}} south. However, although transient tracers are not used in the back-calculation technique employed here, the distribution <b>of</b> <b>Cant</b> is remarkably well correlated with CFCs. We reevaluated the column inventories <b>of</b> <b>Cant</b> for the Southern Ocean and found higher values at high latitudes (70 - 90 mol/m 2) compared to the subtropical/subantarctic region (40 - 80 mol/m 2). These results support the idea that deep and bottom water formation in the Southern Ocean is a key process in the natural sequestration of anthropogenic CO 2...|$|R

40|$|The interannual to decadal {{variability}} in the transport of anthropogenic CO 2 (Cant) across the subpolar North Atlantic (SPNA) is investigated, using summer data of the FOUREX and OVIDE high-resolution transoceanic sections, from Greenland to Portugal, occupied six times from 1997 to 2010. The transport <b>of</b> <b>Cant</b> across this section, T cant hereafter, is northward, with a mean value of 254 ± 29 kmol s − 1 over the 1997 – 2010 period. We find that T cant undergoes interannual variability, masking any trend different from 0 for this period. In {{order to understand the}} mechanisms controlling the variability <b>of</b> T <b>cant</b> across the SPNA, we propose a new method that quantifies the transport <b>of</b> <b>Cant</b> caused by the diapycnal and isopycnal circulation. The diapycnal component yields a large northward transport <b>of</b> <b>Cant</b> (400 ± 29 kmol s − 1) that is partially compensated by a southward transport <b>of</b> <b>Cant</b> caused by the isopycnal component (− 171 ± 11 kmol s − 1), mainly localized in the Irminger Sea. Most importantly, the diapycnal component is found to be the main driver of the variability <b>of</b> T <b>cant</b> across the SPNA. Both the Meridional Overturning Circulation (computed in density coordinates, MOC σ) and the Cant increase in the water column have an important effect on the variability of the diapycnal component and <b>of</b> T <b>cant</b> itself. Based on this analysis, we propose a simplified estimator for the variability <b>of</b> T <b>cant</b> based on the intensity of the MOC σ and on the difference <b>of</b> <b>Cant</b> between the upper and lower limb of the MOC σ (ΔCant). This estimator shows a good consistency with the diapycnal component <b>of</b> T <b>cant,</b> and help to disentangle the effect of the variability of both the circulation and the Cant increase on the T cant variability. We find that ΔCant keeps increasing over the past decade, and it is very likely that the continuous Cant increase in the water masses will cause an increase in T cant across the SPNA at long timescale. Nevertheless, at the timescale analyzed here (1997 – 2010), the MOC σ controls the T cant variability, blurring any T cant trend. Extrapolating the observed ΔCant increase rate and considering the predicted slow-down of 25 % of the MOC σ, T cant across the SPNA is expected to increase by 430 kmol s − 1 during the 21 st century. Consequently, an increase in the storage rate <b>of</b> <b>Cant</b> in the SPNA could be envisaged...|$|R

40|$|ArticleThe Southern Ocean is {{the most}} {{important}} area <b>of</b> anthropogenic carbon (<b>Cant)</b> uptake in the world ocean, only rivalled in importance by the North Atlantic Ocean. Significant variability on decadal time-scales in the uptake <b>of</b> <b>Cant</b> in the Southern Ocean has been observed and modelled, likely with consequences for the interior ocean storage <b>of</b> <b>Cant</b> in the region, and implications for the global carbon budget. Here we use eight cruises between 1973 and 2012 to assess decadal variability in Cant storage rates in the southeast Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. For this we employed the extended multiple linear regression (eMLR) method. We relate variability in DIC (dissolved inorganic carbon) storage, which is assumed to equal anthropogenic carbon storage, to changes in ventilation as observed from repeat measurements of transient tracers. Within the Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) layer, which is the dominant transport conduit for Cant into the interior ocean, moderate Cant storage rates were found without any clear temporal trend. In Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW), a less dense water mass found north of the Subantarctic Front and above AAIW, high storage rates <b>of</b> <b>Cant</b> were observed up to about 2005 but lower rates in more recent times. The transient tracer data suggest a significant speed-up of ventilation in the summer warmed upper part of AAIW between 1998 and 2012, which is consistent with the high storage rate <b>of</b> <b>Cant.</b> A shift <b>of</b> more northern <b>Cant</b> storage to more southern storage in near surface waters was detected in the early 2000 s. Beneath the AAIW the eMLR method as applied here did not detect significant storage <b>of</b> <b>Cant.</b> However, the presence of the transient tracer CFC- 12 all through the water column suggests that some Cant should be present, but at concentrations not reliably quantifiable. The observed temporal variability in the interior ocean seems at a first glance to be out of phase with observed surface ocean Cant fluxes, but this {{can be explained by the}} time delay for the surface ocean signal to manifest itself in the interior of the ocean.
