5000|$|On 15 December, the Turkish Army and Police {{launched}} {{a massive scale}} terror <b>hunt</b> <b>operation</b> in Şırnak Province's towns of Cizre and Silopi imposing an initial 24-hour curfew to [...] "prevent civilian casualties and maximize troop movement through-out the town." [...] The HDP, Turkey's Kurdish and 2nd largest opposition party notably urged PKK militant elements to [...] "resist" [...] the operations. Traditionally focused on the countryside, the PKK has shifted to towns, setting up barricades and digging trenches to keep security forces away.|$|E

50|$|Since Maun's {{founding}} in 1915 as the tribal {{capital of the}} Batawana people, it has {{had a reputation as}} a hard-living 'Wild West' town helping the local cattle ranching and <b>hunting</b> <b>operations.</b> However, with the growth of the tourism industry and the completion of the tar road from Nata in the early 1990s, Maun has developed swiftly, losing much of its old town character. It is now home to over 30,000 people.|$|R
50|$|When {{combat units}} moved forward {{out of a}} region, the Feldgendarmerie role would {{formally}} end as control was then transferred to occupation authorities {{under the control of}} the Nazi Party and SS. But Feldgendarmerie units are known to have assisted the SS in committing war crimes in occupied areas. Author Antony Beevor explores some well-documented cases of their participation in his book Stalingrad. Also, Felgendarmerie units took active part in Jews <b>hunting</b> <b>operations,</b> including in Western Europe.|$|R
50|$|Beekeeping in the Middle Ages {{was a major}} forest {{activity}} because honey {{was still}} the only sweetener for food until the 19th century. As a result, the rights for beekeeping were managed at a high level. This form of activity is mentioned, for example, in connexion with the Nuremberg Imperial Forest. The existence of honey <b>hunting</b> <b>operations</b> helped to protect the forest. Tree species such as lime, pussy willow, fir and also pine were particularly favoured by this type of work.|$|R

50|$|The Bavarian {{immigrants}} colonizing {{the area}} had found the mountain range almost uninhabited, as it perhaps had been throughout Roman times, only with small Slavic settlements scattered in its larger valleys. They immediately began to convert much of the dense forests to cultured land, and started to grow wine. By the 12th century, peasants routinely paid large parts of their taxes in various viniculture products. Salzburg nobility founded a number of estates (some of which exist even today) to exert some control over the wildlife and the <b>hunting</b> <b>operations.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, the {{management}} of the reserve encountered the problem of unsustainable growth of the moose population. By the early 1950s, pastures in the reserve started to be exhausted. To handle the problem, in 1956 a moose hunting enterprise (...) was instituted. The enterprise was affiliated with the reserve, but located outside of its territory. It has been economically successful. Between 1956 and 1968, 1000 moose were taken, providing 200 tons of meat. At the same time, <b>hunting</b> <b>operations</b> allowed the collection of valuable statistics on the biology of the Pechora moose population.|$|R

40|$|Detection and {{classification}} of underwater mines among natural formations and debris along {{the sea floor}} is a tedious task. In order to overcome such scenario an automated computer aided detection and classification system is required. Image processing techniques are used to improve the performance of mine <b>hunting</b> <b>operations</b> using sector-scan, side-scan, magnetometers, cameras, etc. This paper serve as a strategic review {{of the potential for}} image processing techniques to aid the detection and {{classification of}} underwater mines and mine-like objects in side scan sonar imagery. Five basic components of any Computer-Aided Detection and Classification (CAD/CAC) technique are considered namely image preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, computer aided detection and computer aided classification. In this paper more than thirty researchpapers of image processing techniques are clearly reviewed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceModern mines {{have become}} very stealthy. Sonar systems, {{designed}} to detect them, will now also hand over to the classification process many more small non-mine bottom objects, with mine-like target strength. Hence, the classification process is now called upon much more often {{than it was in}} the past, hereby increasing its share in the overall mine hunting effort. In order to evaluate the global performance of the mine <b>hunting</b> <b>operation,</b> the performance of the classification process and especially the shadow classification process has to be evaluated. This performance is described by COC (Classification Operational Characteristics) curves which give the probability of classification (Pc) and the probability of false classification (Pfc) as functions of sonar characteristics and operational conditions. The paper describes the operational incidence of this new approach for shadow classification performance evaluation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceModern mines {{have become}} very stealthy. Sonar {{designed}} to face this threat must use enhanced classification process. The classification decision process corresponds to the discrimination between Mines and Non Mine Bottom Objects (NOMBO). The need for enhanced classification {{is due to the}} increasing number of non-mine objects detected at the first step of the mine <b>hunting</b> <b>operation.</b> The classification must have a reduced ambiguity factor if a good performance is expected. The best way to overcome this difficult classification challenge in common operation conditions is to obtain high resolution and multiple aspects views of the object to be classified. These performance can be obtained by the use of new techniques now available for various existing systems as hull mounted sonar and unmanned underwater vehicles : synthetic aperture imaging and 3 D object reconstruction. Some results obtained at sea are shown...|$|R
50|$|In 1980, Santa Rosa Island was {{included}} within Channel Islands National Park {{over the objections}} of Vail & Vickers, which then successfully lobbied to have the legislation stipulate that purchase of their land would be the highest priority of the Channel Islands National Park. Vail & Vickers sold the island in 1986 for the appraised value of nearly $30 million, which worked out to around $550 per acre. The sale agreement allowed continuation of the ranching and <b>hunting</b> <b>operation</b> for 3 months. Subsequently, the National Park Service issued a series of five-year renewable special use permits. A lawsuit by the National Parks Conservation Association in 1996 resulted in a court-approved settlement agreement which included removal of all cattle from the island and phased reduction by Vail & Vickers of the non-native deer and elk by 2011.|$|R
5000|$|The kid {{carries on}} journeying alone on his mule through {{the plains of}} eastern Texas, and he spends a night in the shelter of a recluse before {{arriving}} in [...] "Bexar" [...] (the county that includes modern-day San Antonio). After a violent encounter with a bartender which establishes the kid as a formidable fighter, he joins a party of ill-armed United States Army irregulars, led by a Captain White, on a filibustering mission to claim Mexican land for the United States. Shortly after entering Mexico, they are attacked, and many killed, by a band of Comanche warriors. Arrested in Chihuahua, the kid is set free when his cell neighbor and prior acquaintance from Texas, the earless Louis Toadvine, tells the authorities {{that the two of}} them would make useful recruits for the state's newly hired scalp <b>hunting</b> <b>operation,</b> led by John Joel Glanton.|$|R

40|$|The {{wild boar}} (Sus scrofa L.) is an {{autochthonous}} game species in {{large parts of}} Europe, and the permanent canines (tusks) of males are traditionally taken as trophies. Even though the tusks of shot animals have been closely examined only a few cases of wild boar tusk pathology have been described. In this paper, four different types of tusk pathology are presented. Eight samples were collected in Croatian hunting grounds during regular <b>hunting</b> <b>operations,</b> while one pair of canines originated from Slovakia. The tusk pathology described as type 1 is attributed to inflammation and partial necrosis of the dental pulp, caused by bacterial invasion. It is further assumed that infection of the enamel organ then caused the extended enamel hypoplasias, which characterize {{the shape of the}} teeth. The other three types of tusk pathology are diagnosed as being the result of either incomplete or complete extra- or intra-alveolar tusk fracture...|$|R

5000|$|The film follows former dolphin {{trainer and}} activist Ric O'Barry's quest to {{document}} the dolphin <b>hunting</b> <b>operations</b> in Taiji, Wakayama, Japan. In the 1960s, O'Barry helped capture and train the five wild dolphins who shared the role of [...] "Flipper" [...] in the hit television series of the same name. The show, very popular, fueled widespread public adoration of dolphins, influencing the development of marine parks that included dolphins in their attractions. After one of the dolphins, in O'Barry's opinion, committed a form of suicide in his arms by closing her blowhole voluntarily in order to suffocate, O'Barry {{came to see the}} dolphin's captivity and the dolphin capture industry as a curse, not a blessing. Days later, he was arrested off the island of Bimini, attempting to cut a hole in the sea pen in order to set free a captured dolphin. Since then, according to the film, O'Barry has dedicated himself full-time as an advocate on behalf of dolphins around the world.|$|R

40|$|Prairie {{dogs are}} {{burrowing}} rodents located throughout the United States. The {{black-tailed prairie dog}} is a common species that primarily inhabits the Great Plains region, with a large population in Texas. While these animals continue to thrive in many locations, {{there has been a}} significant reduction in numbers over the past one hundred years. Several conservation efforts have attempted to remedy this situation. The Black-tailed Prairie Dog Conservation and Management Plan is a long-term monitoring program between the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and cooperating landowners. This plan’s purpose is to develop a strategy that conserves the species while simultaneously protecting property rights. One of the plan’s recommended methods for keeping populations at manageable levels is recreational hunting. This practice provides several landowner benefits, including species control and economic returns.

40|$|TSETSE, Glossina spp., are blood-sucking {{flies and}} the vectors of trypanosomes that cause {{sleeping}} sickness in man and nagana in cattle. Zimbabwe {{is one of}} several countries in Africa where {{attempts have been made to}} controi these flies by eliminating the large wild vertebrate hosts on which they depend for food. Spread of tsetse (mainly G. morsitans) in Zimbabwe in the early 1900 s led to public concern as it threatened several cattle-ranching areas. A Chief Entomologist was appointed in 1909 to define the extent of the country-wide problem (Cockbill, 1964) and hunting commenced in the area of the Gwaai and Shangani river confluence in 1919. The declared aim of this and all subsequent government <b>hunting</b> <b>operations,</b> before 1960, was to eliminate large wild vertebrates (Jack, 1914). This action was taken in the belief that a recent recession in the range of the tsetse had resulted from the rinderpest pandemic that swept through this part of Africa in 1896 decimating wild and domestic ungulates.
