The readings of the second Nocturn are mainly hagiological biography, with homilies or papal documents for certain major feasts, particularly those of Jesus and Mary. Some of this material has been revised by Leo XIII, in view of archaeological and other discoveries. The third Nocturn consists of a homily on the Gospel which is read at that day's Mass.

Walking in each other's shoes takes effort and pause; however, it is my sincere hope that I never lose the patience to view each of you as human beings first, God's creatures, and foremost. I deeply appreciate this opportunity to serve with each of you. I very much look forward to getting to know you better.|$|E
25|$|LQG {{differs from}} string theory {{in that it}} is {{formulated}} in 3 and 4 dimensions and without supersymmetry or Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions, while the latter requires both to be true. There is no experimental evidence to date that confirms string theory's predictions of supersymmetry and Kaluza–Klein extra dimensions. In a 2003 paper A dialog on quantum gravity, Carlo Rovelli regards the fact LQG is formulated in 4 dimensions and without supersymmetry as a strength of the theory as it represents the most parsimonious explanation, consistent with current experimental results, over its rival string/M-theory. Proponents of string theory will often point to the fact that, among other things, it demonstrably reproduces the established theories of general relativity and quantum field theory in the appropriate limits, which Loop Quantum Gravity has struggled to <b>do.</b> <b>In</b> <b>that</b> sense string theory's connection to established physics may be considered more reliable and less speculative, at the mathematical level. Loop Quantum Gravity has nothing to say about the matter(fermions) in the universe.|$|E

He returned to New Orleans, but soon left when Confederate President Jefferson Davis appointed him Attorney General. [...] Benjamin had little to <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> position, but Davis was impressed by his competence and appointed him Secretary of War.

2500|$|After {{losing her}} friend Danielle Jones, Stacey began acting strangely in May 2009, and the {{character}} has {{to come to terms}} with the prospect that, like her mother, she also suffers from bipolar disorder. The storyline was developed as of the BBC's Headroom campaign, which aims to encourage people to look after their mental wellbeing. Series Consultant Simon Ashdown had been developing the storyline for about a year. To accurately reflect the issue, EastEnders worked closely with various charities such as Mind and MDF The BiPolar Organisation, medical practitioners and bipolar sufferers when researching the storyline. The story was moulded around what Stacey would <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> situation and what the research led the team to believe was the most truthful way events would develop. Executive producer Diederick Santer said that the initial buildup of the storyline was an extension of how the character has always been, [...] "a character of highs and lows, of great passions and dark moods," [...] but these highs and lows would become more contrasted, and viewers would realise that Stacey's mood is more complex than just being upset over her losses, adding, [...] "It's the beginning of us getting to really know and understand who Stacey is and what makes her behave the way she does." [...] Turner hoped that she could do the storyline justice, saying that she believed it was great that EastEnders continued to raise awareness of the issue.|$|E
