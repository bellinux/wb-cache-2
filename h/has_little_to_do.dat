5|$|Kerrigan {{returns in}} StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty (2010). At BlizzCon 2007, Chris Metzen {{explained}} {{that in the}} years after Brood War, Kerrigan relocated to Char, pulling back most of the Zerg, and has since been quiet. She has the power to wipe out all her enemies but has not, creating a tense state of peace in the sector. Metzen also indicated an interest in exploring if there was any humanity left in Kerrigan or if she is beyond redemption in her current state. He revealed that Kerrigan's withdrawal <b>has</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with any suspicion she has of Duran, who is revealed towards the end of Brood War to be conducting secret experiments on creating a Protoss/Zerg hybrid; she does not know much about him, but in the time after Brood War, she is beginning to piece together the puzzle surrounding his motives. At BlizzCon 2008, Kerrigan made two brief appearances in cinematic trailers, one during an attack on a Terran city that was captured on video, and again in a series of caverns where Zeratul was studying ancient runes; in the latter, Kerrigan implies she has been waiting for his arrival.|$|E

25|$|Vertigo {{can also}} be {{classified}} into objective, subjective, and pseudovertigo. Objective vertigo describes when the person has the sensation that stationary objects in the environment are moving. Subjective vertigo refers to when the person feels {{as if they are}} moving. The third type is known as pseudovertigo, an intensive sensation of rotation inside the person's head. While this classification appears in textbooks, it <b>has</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the pathophysiology or treatment of vertigo.|$|E

Where such a bond ceases to exist, modern society is generally happy for the relationship to be dissolved. Thus we have 'a democracy of the emotions in everyday life' (Runaway World, 1999).|$|E

25|$|When Søren Kierkegaard, as his {{character}} Johannes Climacus, ends his writings: My thesis was, subjectivity, heartfelt is the truth, {{he does not}} advocate for subjectivism in its extreme form (the theory that something is true simply because one believes it to be so), but rather that the objective approach to matters of personal truth cannot shed any light upon that which is most essential to a person's life. Objective truths {{are concerned with the}} facts of a person's being, while subjective truths are concerned with a person's way of being. Kierkegaard agrees that objective truths for the study of subjects like mathematics, science, and history are relevant and necessary, but argues that objective truths do not shed any light on a person's inner relationship to existence. At best, these truths can only provide a severely narrowed perspective that <b>has</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with one's actual experience of life.|$|E
25|$|Those {{born into}} a {{monolingual}} Dutch family in Brussels had always had {{a lower level of}} education than the average for Brussels. By contrast, 30% of the Flemings who had moved to Brussels from elsewhere had a university degree or other post-secondary education, and were highly qualified. For example, since 1970 in Belgium as a whole, there have been more students enrolled in Dutch language universities than French ones. To be called a Dutch-speaker no longer evokes images of lower-class laborers, as it long had. Bilingualism is increasingly a prerequisite for well-paying jobs, and what prestige the Dutch language currently has in Brussels is chiefly for economic reasons. It {{should be noted that the}} economic importance of Dutch in Brussels <b>has</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the proportion of Brussels that is Dutch-speaking. Rather, it is primarily relations between businesses in Brussels and Flemish businesses, or more generally, with Dutch-speaking businesses as a whole that ensure the economic importance of Dutch in Brussels.|$|E

The movie is an ever-deepening reflection on the allure of Hollywood and on the multiple role-playing and self-invention that the movie-going experience promises...

Hoberman from The Village Voice echoes this sentiment by calling it a [...] "poisonous valentine to Hollywood".|$|E

She wore a costume {{that came to}} be known as the [...] "ACE-bandage" [...] costume; the body suit designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier was made of medical bandages. The Fifth Element was selected as the opening film for the 1997 Cannes Film Festival and its worldwide box office gross was over $263 million, more than three times its budget of $80 million. The Fifth Element was often praised for its visual style; critic James Berardinelli wrote, [...] "Jovovich makes an impression, although her effectiveness <b>has</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with acting and less to do with dialogue". Jovovich was nominated for [...] "Favorite Female Newcomer" [...] at the Blockbuster Entertainment Awards and [...] "Best Fight" [...] at the MTV Movie Awards.

La Plante played {{roles in}} more than 50 films before starring in The Cat and the Canary. According to film historian Gary Don Rhodes, her part in The Cat and the Canary was typical for women in horror and mystery films: [...] "The female in the horror film ... becomes the hunted, the quarry. She <b>has</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and so the question becomes 'What will be done with her?'" [...] Rhodes adds, [...] "The heroines are young and beautiful, but represent more a prize to be possessed—whether “stolen” by a villain or “owned” by a young hero at the films' conclusions." [...] Following The Cat and the Canary, La Plante maintained a career with Universal, but she {{is described as a}} [...] "victim of talkies." [...] She received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame before her death in 1996 from Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
500|$|Beckinsale {{returned}} to acting in 2012 with appearances in three action films. Beckinsale {{first appeared in}} the action thriller Contraband. She had a supporting role as the wife of Mark Wahlberg's character, a former criminal who gets forced back into a life of crime after his family members are threatened. The film was directed by Baltasar Kormákur, who also starred in the Icelandic language version of the film, Reykjavík-Rotterdam. The San Francisco Chronicle felt Beckinsale was [...] "stuck {{in a bit of a}} thankless role as the victimised wife, but she does try to infuse a harder edge to the character." [...] The Hollywood Reporter stated that [...] "Beckinsale, her innate classiness calibrated down a few notches, <b>has</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> but be supportive, worried and, eventually, besieged." [...] Entertainment Weekly felt that the [...] "woman-in-peril stuff is second-rate, giving off a whiff of exploitation" [...] while Variety found the repeated violence towards Beckinsale's character disturbing. The film had a production budget of $25million and has grossed over $96million worldwide.|$|E
500|$|It {{has often}} been {{suggested}} {{that this type of}} preservation was possible only when sediments were not disturbed by burrowing animals or the anchors of plants.

This suggests that such bioturbation <b>has</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the appearance and disappearance of Burgess Shale type preservation. Such preservation may depend on the presence of clay-like minerals that inhibit decomposition, and ocean chemistry may only have favoured the production of such minerals for limited periods of time.

A few fossils of animals similar to those found in the Burgess Shale have been found in rocks from the Silurian, Ordovician and Early Devonian periods, in other words up to 100million years after the Burgess Shale.|$|E
