50|$|Since the NHTS-PR is {{technically}} an information management system, {{it is very}} reliant on technology. It uses Open Technologies as the primary software backbone and the latest multiple processor servers available at the time. A major challenge inherent to data sharing is porting since different agencies are using different proprietary software. To overcome such challenge, <b>data</b> <b>porting</b> software are developed in-house from existing Open Source systems.|$|E
30|$|The mobile devices {{market is}} an {{emerging}} mass market with little data usage research available. Consumers are changing their habits, the Internet players are adapting their contents {{to adjust the}} new needs, and operators are maintaining a high cost and network restrictions to avoid massive usage. In this market, the business model is restricted to cost-per-use, so <b>data</b> <b>porting</b> to mobile devices have not really taken off.|$|E
40|$|The {{presented}} work {{is part of}} {{a larger}} research program dealing with developing tools for coupling biogeochemical models in contaminated landscapes. The specific objective of this article is to provide the researchers a tool to build hexagonal raster using information from a rectangular raster data (e. g. GIS format), <b>data</b> <b>porting.</b> This tool involves a computational algorithm and an open source software (written in C). The method of extending the reticulated functions defined on 2 D networks is an essential key of this algorithm and can also be used for other purposes than <b>data</b> <b>porting.</b> The algorithm allows one to build the hexagonal raster with a cell size independent from the geometry of the rectangular raster. The extended function is a bi-cubic spline which can exactly reconstruct polynomials up to degree three in each variable. We validate the method by analyzing errors in some theoretical case studies followed by other studies with real terrain elevation data. We also introduce and briefly present an iterative water routing method and use it for validation on a case with concrete terrain data...|$|E

5000|$|Although {{typically}} {{described as}} <b>data</b> <b>ports,</b> {{the interface between}} a radio and a TNC is almost entirely analog audio (plus lines for PTT and squelch).

50|$|Dial-up analog alarm panels or {{systems with}} serial/parallel <b>data</b> <b>ports</b> may be {{migrated}} to broadband through {{the addition of}} an alarm server device which converts telephone signaling signals or <b>data</b> <b>port</b> traffic to IP messages suitable for broadband transmission. But the direct use of VoIP (POTS port on premises terminal) to transport analog alarms without an alarm server device is problematic as the audio codecs used throughout the entire network transmission path cannot guarantee a suitable level of reliability or quality of service acceptable for the application.|$|R
5000|$|The CPU {{communicates}} {{with the}} VDC through an 8-bit bus. A pin {{controlled by the}} CPU separates this bus into two [...] "ports", a control <b>port</b> and a <b>data</b> <b>port.</b> To write or read a byte of video memory, the CPU first has to write two bytes on the VDC's control port to the VDC's internal address register. Next, the CPU performs the actual write or read on the VDC's <b>data</b> <b>port.</b> As a <b>data</b> byte is written or read, the TMS9918 automatically increments the internal address register.
