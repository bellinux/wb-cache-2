5|$|The USAF {{issued a}} new policy {{directive}} regarding the handling {{of nuclear weapons and}} delivery systems, which prohibits the storing of nuclear armed and nonnuclear armed weapons in the same storage facility. The directive further instructs that all nonnuclear munitions and missiles must be labeled with placards clearly stating that they are not armed with nuclear warheads. Wing commanders are now charged with approving any movement of nuclear weapons from weapons storage areas and must appoint a single individual as a munitions accountability system officer and weapons custodian. All units that handle nuclear weapons must develop a coordinated visual inspection checklist. The policy further directs that airmen charged with handling or maintaining nuclear weapons cannot be on duty for longer than 12 hours, unless during an emergency, when their <b>duty</b> <b>period</b> can be extended to a maximum of 16 hours. The USAF has since instituted a program of surprise inspections at nuclear-armed bases.|$|E

50|$|Upon {{conclusion}} of a 24-hour duty shift, trainees shall have a minimum of 10 hours off before being required to be on duty again. Upon completing a lesser hour <b>duty</b> <b>period,</b> adequate time for rest and personal activity must be provided.|$|E
50|$|The {{first step}} to {{understanding}} the critical impact fatigue can have on flight safety is to quantify it within the airline environment. An airline's management often struggles to balance rest with <b>duty</b> <b>periods</b> because it strives for maximum crew productivity. However, fatigue comes as a limitation needing increasing consideration.|$|R
40|$|Most of the {{research}} related to human fatigue in the aviation industry has focussed on long-haul pilots, but short-haul pilots also experience elevated levels of fatigue. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the impact of early start times on the amount of sleep obtained prior to duty and on fatigue levels at the start of duty. Seventy short-haul pilots collected data regarding their duty schedule and sleep/wake behaviour for at least two weeks. Data were collected using self-report duty/sleep diaries and wrist activity monitors. Mixed-effects regression analyses were used to examine the effects of duty start time (04 : 00 – 10 : 00 h) on (i) the total amount of sleep obtained in the 12 h prior to the start of duty and (ii) self-rated fatigue level at the start of duty. Both analyses indicated significant main effects of duty start time. In particular, the amount of sleep obtained in the 12 h prior to duty was lowest for <b>duty</b> <b>periods</b> that commenced between 04 : 00 and 05 : 00 h (i. e. 5. 4 h), and greatest for <b>duty</b> <b>periods</b> that commenced between 09 : 00 and 10 : 00 h (i. e. 6. 6 h). These data indicate that approximately 15 min of sleep is lost for every hour that the start of duty is advanced prior to 09 : 00 h. In addition, self-rated fatigue at the start of duty was highest for <b>duty</b> <b>periods</b> that commenced between 04 : 00 and 05 : 00 h, and lowest for <b>duty</b> <b>periods</b> that commenced between 09 : 00 and 10 : 00 h. Airlines should implement a fatigue risk management system (FRMS) for short-haul pilots required to work early-morning shifts. One component of the FRMS should be focussed on the production of ‘fatigue-friendly’ rosters. A second component of the FRMS should be focussed on training pilots to optimise sleep opportunities, to identify circumstances where the likelihood of fatigue is elevated, and to manage the risks associated with fatigue-related impairment...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the Aircrew Scheduling Problem of determining {{tours of duty}} (TODs) for aircrews, given a set of sectors (or flights) requiring regular crews. A regular crew consists of two crew members, but by including supplementary crew (a third pilot) on some sectors {{it is possible to}} extend <b>duty</b> <b>periods</b> to generate more cost efficient TODS. A related problem is thus to generate TODs for these third pilots, but the sectors requiring a third pilot are not known in advance. To solve these two related problems simultaneously, we apply a heuristic procedure that solves a sequence of matching problems, i. e. a repeated matching algorithm. Numerical results based on the solution of a real problem show that this approach is a valid and efficient method for solving the Aircrew Scheduling Problem, especially when there is the option of using supplementary crew to extend <b>duty</b> <b>periods.</b> ...|$|R

5000|$|National {{aviation}} regulators typically use the hours-of-service {{approach to}} prevent fatigue. The hours-of-service is usually measured by flight <b>duty</b> <b>period</b> which {{is defined as}} [...] "a period which commences when a flight crew member is required to report for duty... and which finishes when the aircraft is parked with no intention of movement". Limits are generally set on flight duty time across daily, weekly, and monthly time periods.

There are also requirements for time free from duty after consecutive days on duty.|$|E
