5000|$|The FZ {{came as a}} 4-stroke, four-cylinder, four-carburetor, {{naturally}} aspirated, {{air-cooled engine}} package mated with a six-gear constant mesh transmission, dropped into a rectangular tube frame that seemed pieced together from a modern standpoint, balanced upon a large rear mono shock hidden between the swingarm and subframe under the battery complementary to two smooth front forks. It has two large circular headlights iconic of Yamaha FZR's large and small displacement. The fuel tank has a triangular side profile that matches the frame well, with a flat top and a fuel petcock at the bottom left with an overflow hose fitting {{at the bottom of}} the front. The four Mikuni BS-30 carburetors utilize the [...] "Round-Slide" [...] design with the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>assembly</b> actuating the main needle jets, with plastic floats and brass slides. It uses two ignition coils (two cylinders each) controlled by a CDI (Capacitor Discharge Ignition) printed circuit board unit, and timed by a two brush [...] "Pick-Up Coil" [...] mounted to the crank. The engine oil doubles as the transmission's lubricant, wetting the manual clutch. The FZ-600 was air-cooled however, with a radiator-looking oil cooler mounted on the front of the frame between the engine and front wheel. It also had a thundering four-into-one exhaust. It has a 4-fuse, fuse block providing for the headlights, turn signals, rectifier/regulator, etc.|$|E

50|$|The {{vestibule}} on {{a railroad}} passenger car is an enclosed {{area at the}} end of the carbody, usually separated from the main part of the interior by a door, which is power-operated on most modern equipment. Entrance to and exit from the car is through the side doors, which lead into the vestibule. When passenger cars are coupled, their vestibules are joined by mating faceplate and <b>diaphragm</b> <b>assemblies</b> to create a weather-tight seal for the safety and comfort of passengers who are stepping from car to car. In British usage the term refers to the part of the carriage where the passenger doors are located; this can be at the ends of the carriage (on long-distance stock) or at the 1/4 and 3/4 of length positions (typical on modern suburban stock).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} an ongoing research project that was initiated {{to better understand the}} dynamic behaviour of low-rise steel buildings that rely on metal roof deck diaphragm response for lateral seismic resistance. The project includes a large ambient and forced vibration test program on actual building structures located both in eastern and western regions of Canada. Test results include natural frequencies, mode shapes, and damping ratios. For several buildings, tests are conducted at various stages during the construction so that the contribution of the different building components to the dynamic properties of the structures can be assessed. Laboratory testing is also conducted to determine shear stiffness properties of roof <b>diaphragm</b> <b>assemblies,</b> including the contribution of non-structural roofing material. Test results are used to develop numerical modelling techniques capable of reproducing field test data for the buildings studied. This project should permit the use of advanced analytical tools for cost-efficient seismic of low-rise steel buildings...|$|R

40|$|Three test {{instruments}} are being evaluated {{to determine the}} feasibility of using photoacoustic technology for measuring unburned carbon in fly ash. The first test instrument is a single microwave frequency system previously constructed to measure photoacoustic signals in an off-line configuration. A second off-line instrument was constructed {{based in part on}} lessons learned with the first instrument, but which also expands the capabilities of the first instrument. Improvements include a control loop to allow more constant microwave power output and an ability to operate over a range of microwave frequencies. The third instrument, the on-line version of the fly ash monitor, has been designed, constructed, and initial efficiency tests have been conducted on the monitor's electrical components. Photoacoustic measurements were collected using the off-line MEPA spectrometer with different microwave frequencies in order to develop photoacoustic microwave spectra of several fly ash samples. Microwaves from 500 MHz to 1800 MHz were used. Modifications to the on-line thermal elastic fly ash monitor include the improving the operation of the agitator for the bottom hopper, and installing a second <b>diaphragm</b> <b>assembly</b> in the freeboard section of the fly ash monitor.

40|$|This paper compares a MEMS Piezoresistive {{pressure}} sensor which utilizes a circular and square shaped polysilicon diaphragm with a nanowire {{to enhance the}} sensitivity of the {{pressure sensor}}. The nanowires for both the sensors form the bridge between the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>assembly.</b> The high Piezoresistive effect of polysilicon nanowires is used to enhance the sensitivity. The circular and square shaped polysilicon diaphragm with nanowire which are like piezoresistor were fabricated by means of RIE(reactive ion etching). This paper describes the performance analysis, structural design and fabrication of piezoresistive pressure sensor using simulation technique. The polysilicon nanowire has a thickness about 10 nm. Finite element method is adopted to optimize the sensor output and to improve the sensitivity of both the circular and square shaped polysilicon diaphragm with nanowire to form Piezoresistive pressure sensor. The best position to place the Polysilicon nanowires to receive maximum stress was also considered during the design process.

50|$|In September 1981, {{the first}} {{location}} abroad {{was established in}} Torrance, California, United States as USA Zama Inc. to support the Headquarters in Japan by marketing, importing and delivering Zama carburetors to American customers. After four years another factory was opened in Iwate, Japan which specialized in <b>diaphragm</b> carburetor <b>assembly</b> as well as die designing and tooling. In March 1989, Zama Industries was founded in Hong Kong to reduce the negative impact on revenue caused by a sudden change of the currency exchange rate of JPY and USD. Another facility was opened in November 1990 in Franklin, Tennessee, USA to expand the US operations in engineering and to establish a Zama aftermarket department. In August 1991, a second factory with 400 employees was opened in Iwate, Japan {{to meet the demands}} for more capacity. The factory was opened for die-casting and machining for automobile parts. By the end of 1991, a factory with 450 employees was opened in the Special Economic Zone of XiLi, Shenzhen, China and major parts of the Hong Kong facilities were moved there. The main focus of this facility is the production of diaphragm carburetors. Due to the strong growth, the factory was extended in 1997 and in 2000. In 2006, when direct labor headcount had surpassed 1,000 employees, all production facilities were consolidated in one factory site in Shenzhen and a die-casting and storage facility in Hong Kong. Due to rising risk of only one main production site, Zama decided to open a second main production facility in Santo Tomas, Batangas, Philippines which was inaugurated in January 2016. In 2017 the XiLi factories are expected to move to a new factory in Huizhou, China due to municipal plans to remodel the former industrial area of XiLi into a commercial/residential zone.|$|R

Displacement occurred in vertically and horizontally to make the statistical comparison and calibration of the model. It was found that the species H. alchorneoides presented the physical-mechanical properties and efforts allowable design above the wood of G. arborea. In addition, the <b>diaphragm</b> of wall <b>assemblies</b> H. alchorneoides with screws presented the significantly higher values of load in the limit proportional and maximum load, as well as the highest relationship load-displacement, horizontally and vertically, due to the best characteristics of the wood of this species compared with G. arborea and the screw element of union. This type of diaphragm had the lowest percentage of calibration. Itâ€™s concluded that on the mechanical behavior of a wall, the one factor that most influences is the type of connection (nails or screws) and not so much the type of wood.

40|$|Nonlinearity in {{oscillations}} {{and waves}} {{can lead to}} dramatic and useful behavior. The course PH 4459 at the Naval Postgraduate School was recently redesigned to extend its original subject of nonlinear acoustics to nonlinear oscillations and waves in general, with minimal prerequisites so that non-acoustics-tracked students can enroll in the course. Due to the unusual behavior and mathematical difficulty of nonlinear systems, lecture demonstrations are vital {{to the teaching of}} the course. The purpose of this thesis is to develop two new demonstrations for the course, and to improve an existing demonstration. In one of the new demonstrations, we investigate the generation and detection of high-amplitude waves on water to demonstrate the dependence of the wave speed upon amplitude. The experimental data agree with the theory. In the other new demonstration, we investigate a compression driver that exhibits a strong response at half the frequency of the drive. Data and the current scientific literature indicate that this behavior is due to parametric excitation of the deformation modes of the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>assembly.</b> Finally, we describe improvements to a torsional oscillator that is parametrically excited by modulation of its length. The improvements include a new motor, sturdier construction, and a new torsional strip...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSlit {{diaphragms}} are specialized junctions between glomerular {{epithelial cells}} (podocytes) that are crucial for glomerular ultrafiltration. Ig superfamily members nephrin and Neph 1 are essential {{components of the}} slit diaphragm, whereas the role of Neph 1 homologue Neph 3 in the slit diaphragm is unknown. Here we show that Neph 3 homodimerizes and heterodimerizes with nephrin and Neph 1. We further investigated whether these interactions {{play a role in}} cell adhesion by using mouse L fibroblasts that lack endogenous cell adhesion activity, and found that Neph 1 and Neph 3 are able to induce cell adhesion alone whereas nephrin needs to trans-interact with Neph 1 or Neph 3 in order to promote formation of cell-cell contacts. Tyrosine phosphorylation of nephrin was down-regulated after nephrin trans-interacted with either Neph 1 or Neph 3 leading to formation of cell-cell contacts. We further found that the expression of Neph 3 was increased in nephrin deficient mouse kidneys suggesting that Neph 3 may participate in the formation of tight-junction-like structures observed in nephrin deficient podocytes. Our findings show that nephrin and Neph 1 or Neph 3 trans-interactions promote cell contact formation suggesting that they could function together also in the slit <b>diaphragm</b> <b>assembly,</b> and when nephrin is absent, participate in the formation of altered junctional complexes between podocyte foot processes...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe Wilms' tumor {{suppressor}} WT 1 {{is a key}} regulator of podocyte {{function that}} is mutated in Denys-Drash and Frasier syndromes. Here we have used an integrative approach employing ChIP, exon array, and genetic analyses in mice to address general and isoform-specific functions of WT 1 in podocyte differentiation. Analysis of ChIP-Seq data showed that {{almost half of the}} podocyte-specific genes are direct targets of WT 1. Bioinformatic analysis further identified coactivator FOXC 1 -binding sites in proximity to WT 1 -bound regions, thus supporting coordinated action of these transcription factors in regulating podocyte-specific genes. Transcriptional profiling of mice lacking the WT 1 alternative splice isoform (+KTS) had a more restrictive set of genes whose expression depends on these alternatively spliced isoforms. One of these genes encodes the membrane-associated guanylate kinase MAGI 2, a protein that localizes {{to the base of the}} slit diaphragm. Using functional analysis in mice, we further show that MAGI 2 Î± is essential for proper localization of nephrin and the assembly of the slit diaphragm complex. Finally, a dramatic reduction of MAGI 2 was found in an LPS mouse model of glomerular injury and in genetic cases of human disease. Thus, our study highlights the central role of WT 1 in podocyte differentiation, identifies that WT 1 has a central role in podocyte differentiation, and identifies MAGI 2 Î± as the crucial isoform in slit <b>diaphragm</b> <b>assembly,</b> suggesting a causative role of this gene in the etiology of glomerular disorders...|$|E

40|$|The glomerular {{ultrafiltration}} barrier contains highly terminally differentiated podocytes {{with major}} processes and foot processes interlinked by ultrathin slit diaphragms. A number of molecules {{that are associated}} with nephrosis and podocyte damage have been described and these discoveries have given insight into the mechanisms that lead to podocyte injury. One of these molecules is CD 2 -associated protein (CD 2 AP), which is a crucial protein for slit- <b>diaphragm</b> <b>assembly</b> and function. In {{spite of the fact that}} CD 2 AP knockout causes nephrotic syndrome in mice and the heterozygous +/- mouse is prone to proteinuria, little is known about the relevance of this molecule in human renal pathology. In this thesis I studied the effect of a disease causing CD 2 AP mutation on the human podocyte phenotype. I identified the dramatic effects of the CD 2 AP mutation on the morphology of the cells and on the expression of mesenchymal, epithelial and other markers. I found that in contrast to wild type podocytes, CD 2 AP mutant podocytes acquired the characteristics of dedifferentiated cells. I compared the phenotypic characteristics of the CD 2 AP mutant podocytes with podocytes carrying mutations in the transcription factor WTI which is essential for normal nephrogenesis. Surprisingly, this study detected a similar de-differentiated phenotype in the CD 2 AP mutant podocytes to that seen in podocytes carrying a mutation in the WTl gene. In view of these phenotypic similarities I studied whether there is a functional link between CD 2 AP and WTI which confer these similarities in cellular phenotype. CD 2 AP is also known to bind to WTIP (WTl interacting protein), a molecule that binds WTI and can shuttle to the nucleus during podocyte injury. In this study, I found that WTIP might provide the functional link between CD 2 AP and WTl. In addition, in this study I have established the first conditionally immortalized human glomerular mesangial cell line with unique migratory properties, which will be an important adjunct in studies of representative glomerular cells, as well as in eo-culture studies. Overall this thesis demonstrates that there are clear implications for a novel role for CD 2 AP in the development and progression of glomerular disease. This thesis also discusses a novel conditionally immortalized human mesangial cell line that represents a new tool for the study of human mesangial cell biology in vitro.
