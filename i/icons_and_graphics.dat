The checklist is divided into five main parts followed by Rating Table. The quantitative pointing system (ten point scale) and five point rating scales are used to evaluate and rank the websites. The study reveals that very few (16 percent) websites provide information about the date of last updating. Similarly very few (20 percent) websites provide links to other web reference sites and a moderate number (40 percent) have feedback forms for comments. On the other side, a good number of websites (76 percent) are efficient in loading images, <b>icons,</b> <b>and</b> <b>graphics,</b> and a large number (80 percent) have incorporated a web OPAC. The study is limited to the evaluation of websites of five academic libraries located in Bangalore, India...|$|E
40|$|Mobile {{applications}} on smart {{phones and}} tablets and on mobile devices in general {{have increased the}} dependence of the user on icons and graphic elements for effective communication via the interface. Well-designed <b>icons</b> <b>and</b> <b>graphics</b> allow the user to recognize without the need of additional instructions the functions available on the mobile device in question. The present paper offers an analysis of graphic representation by means of icons for mobile devices. In terms of semiotics, the function of representation involves emphasizing {{the relationship between the}} object and the interpretant. In particular, we examine how far any icon represents the meaning of the function for which it has been designed, chosen and installed by the mobile phone manufacturer and designer. Among the chief findings are (1) graphical representation affects the recognition rate of icons and influences user perception and (2) there are significant differences in performance in recognizing icons among different age groups...|$|E

The paper begins with an explanation of how graphic user interfaces differ from character-based systems {{in their use of}} pixels, visual metaphors such as <b>icons</b> <b>and</b> windows, locational and cohtextual information, and mouse-controlled interaction and random access. The paper then analyzes how much of the benefits of the graphic user interface are sared by blind users. Three stages of access to the graphic user interface are described: (1) the customizing stage; (2) the ssingle-sensory mouseless strategy for providing access to standard text, <b>icons</b> <b>and</b> simple <b>graphics,</b> standard graphical structures, and navigation and control; (3) the multisensory approach with a resurrected mouse, designed to extend compatibility across applications and operating systems and exten...|$|R

This is a {{surprising}} case of practice lessening performance. We argue that the meaning of road signs is built {{in the context of the}} driver task and in the context of the current road situation. We have run an experiment that show that expert drivers fail to the “what does it mean ” question when road signs are displayed in isolation or in the context of a real road situation, but they succeed to the “what to do ” questioning. We described the whole set of 300 road signs both from their surface properties (form, color, <b>icons,</b> …) <b>and</b> from the required actions. The road signalization system appears to be a complex system that is not fully coherent since surface properties partially match the corresponding actions properties. Finally, we advocate that contextual graphs capture the effects of task and road context, as well as the automatization and proceduralization processes since it allows encapsulation of action sequences. 1...|$|R

40|$|It {{is often}} claimed that road users have a poor {{knowledge}} of traffic rules and signs. Then, their behavior may vary from the expected behavior, producing misuses and accidents {{into the road}} network. From {{the point of view}} where road signs meaning is context-dependent, this paper is aimed at understanding how a loosing knowledge process can be built up during the driving experience.
