40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} and define competencies <b>for</b> <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>community</b> services/continuing education directors;A review of literature on <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>community</b> services/continuing education, community services leadership, <b>community</b> <b>college</b> presidential competencies, and business management/leadership was conducted. The review of literature yielded little literature on community services/continuing education research and writings. Literature on <b>community</b> <b>college</b> presidential competencies and business management/leadership was more prevalent which provided competencies appropriate <b>for</b> <b>community</b> service/continuing education directors. A doctoral dissertation conducted in 1989 provided a set of 43 identified competencies <b>for</b> <b>community</b> <b>college</b> presidents. The competencies served as the foundation for this study;Data were gathered for the competency identification through the use of a three round Delphi process. This process was conducted by a team of nominated experts representing ten geographic regions of the United States;The major conclusions of this study were: A list of 50 competencies with definitions was identified <b>for</b> <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>community</b> services/continuing education directors; 18 reached consensus; 25 reached stability; five reached neither consensus nor stability; and two were identified too late to receive full consideration. These competencies were those that were initially identified from the dissertation; identified in rounds one, two, or three; or suggested by the expert panel;Conclusions of this study were: (1) literature in community services/continuing education is not readily available; (2) a set of 43 competencies has been developed <b>for</b> <b>community</b> services/continuing education directors; (3) staff development activities can be designed to reinforce and improve competencies of directors; (4) competencies can be used in developing position descriptions for directors; and (5) graduate programs <b>for</b> <b>community</b> <b>college</b> professionals may offer courses that may enhance or strengthen competencies <b>for</b> <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>community</b> services/continuing education directors...|$|R

40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityCommunity colleges are experiencing many challenges that stem from political and fiscal uncertainties and these challenges are often exacerbated by high turnover in executive leadership positions (Floyd et al., 2010), which has implications for longterm strategic planning. The magnitude of {{the problems associated with}} high turnover rates <b>for</b> <b>community</b> <b>college</b> presidents prompted the W. K. Kellogg Foundation to award a grant to the American Association of <b>Community</b> <b>College</b> (AACC) in 2003 for the specific purpose of documenting the requisite values, skills, and competencies <b>for</b> <b>community</b> <b>college</b> leaders (American Association of <b>Community</b> <b>Colleges,</b> 2005). The purposes of this study was therefore to add to the body of knowledge on <b>community</b> <b>college</b> presidents, investigate the factors leading to longevity in tenure <b>for</b> exemplary California <b>community</b> <b>college</b> presidents, and determine how the competency domains reported by the AACC relate to longevity in tenure <b>for</b> <b>community</b> <b>college</b> presidents. This mixed-methods study was designed to answer the following research questions: (1) What are the leadership skills that facilitate longevity in tenure <b>for</b> exemplary <b>community</b> <b>college</b> presidents? (2) What leadership-support structures enhance longevity in tenure <b>for</b> exemplary <b>community</b> <b>college</b> presidents? (3) What relationships do exemplary <b>community</b> <b>college</b> presidents create and maintain? (4) What factors and experiences are of significance in preparing exemplary <b>community</b> <b>college</b> presidents? And, (5) How are the AACC's competency domains related to longevity in tenure <b>for</b> exemplary <b>community</b> <b>college</b> presidents? Taking a comprehensive look at factors that enhance longevity in tenure <b>for</b> <b>community</b> <b>college</b> presidents required that qualitative and quantitative data be collected from multiple sources. Consequently, qualitative data were collected from 48 California <b>community</b> <b>college</b> presidents using a study specific survey instrument. In addition, qualitative data were collected from 48 California <b>community</b> <b>college</b> presidents using the survey instrument and interviews were conducted with four additional <b>community</b> <b>college</b> presidents, one retired <b>community</b> <b>college</b> president, one <b>community</b> <b>college</b> chancellor, two <b>community</b> <b>college</b> vice presidents, two board of trustee members, and two faculty leaders. The findings from this research revealed that longevity in tenure <b>for</b> <b>community</b> <b>college</b> presidents is enhanced by the president’s ability to communicate with individuals and constituent groups, and the president's ability to speak before large audiences. Second, the president's ability to demonstrate a balance between expert knowledge and charisma as well as manage personnel, personnel conflicts, and change initiatives was linked to length in tenure. Third, presidents who have a natural tendency towards being patient with individuals and governance processes that are able to garner support from the board of trustees, professional networks, peer networks, mentors, and constituent leaders tend to have longer tenures as presidents. A fourth theme regarding experiences that enhance longevity suggests that aspiring presidents should spend time in diverse and increasingly challenging leadership roles in the <b>community</b> <b>college</b> system. Fifth, the data revealed that the collection of competencies specified by the AACC is more important with respect to longevity in tenure than the compilation of other skills and competencies identified in an extensive review of the literature. The final finding suggests that there are differences with respect to gender when considering the skills, competencies, and factors that enhance longevity in tenure <b>for</b> exemplary <b>community</b> <b>college</b> presidents...|$|R
