She refused to chair meetings, telling her WSPU colleagues she was [...] "quite useless <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing" [...] and would only say [...] "five words if nobody else would support the forthcoming resolution". However, Singh later chaired and addressed a number of meetings.

[...] However, he criticized the Magnus-Sting due to [...] "The idea here was to make Magnus by having Sting lose clean in a back and forth contest.

He described the entire show as [...] "It was just a show - some good, some eh, but Bound for Glory should never be just a show, it's their Wrestlemania, except this year, it wasn't. Pat McNeill, from PWTorch, said Bound for Glory [...] "Wasn't a great event". Bob Kapur, from CANOE Slam, said that he enjoyed the event overall. Also, Matthew Asher, from CANOE too, enjoyed the PPV but said the ultimate success of this Bound for Glory rests on the future storylines this event sets up.|$|E

He said in an interview, [...] "The experience [...] was the reason I stopped making movies for the Hollywood studios. I won't work for them again.

By November 2009, Little, Brown and Company had purchased the North American rights to the series. The series will have some overlap with his previous series, A Series of Unfortunate Events, but will not involve its protagonists, the Baudelaire orphans. Daniel Handler, the author behind the Snicket pen name, clarified that the series [...] "is mostly an entirely new story. But if you are a close reader of the series you will see some overlap.

2500|$|A+E {{started as}} a [...] "reaction" [...] against Coxon's {{previous}} album, The Spinning Top, a mostly acoustic album. According to Coxon, the songs were difficult to play, resulting in some audiences being unsatisfied in [...] "venues that weren't set up <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing". Producer Ben Hillier described the recording of the album as [...] "quick" [...] and [...] "fun", due to him trying to record Coxon's first takes on songs when it was possible. In 2 months, Coxon was able to record 21 tracks; 10 of them made it onto A+E, while the other 11 were grouped into an album that was expected be released in late 2012. According to Hillier, the latter is [...] "less riff-based" [...] and more [...] "soul-influenced, with backing singers and strings.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, {{the special}} was rated TV-MA, while {{the series is}} rated TV-14. When asked about the network's Standards and Practices, Weidenfeld stated that [...] "I find when {{something}} comes back that you can't say, we're able to skirt around it and make something funnier." [...] According to Neely and Weidenfeld, the network forced them to cut smoking out of the show; Jack Falgot, a character in the series, was planned to smoke on a cigarette in every scene he appeared in. The network issued to have the cigarette changed to a lollipop for broadcast. Neely revealed that his team try to incorporate some of the [...] "hallmark components" [...] of his shorts (e.g. first-person narrative and flashbacks), but find their audience not [...] "really have the patience <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing". In sticking to a mostly third-person narrative, his team is more confident in the reception toward the series.|$|E
2500|$|Today {{a growing}} body of {{scientific}} evidence indicate that this disease process, in the cancellous bone and bone marrow, is caused by bone infarcts mediated by a range of local and systemic factors. Bone infarcts as well as damage to the deeper portion of the cancellous bone is an insidious process. It is certainly not visible clinically and routine imaging techniques such as radiographs are not effective <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> damage. [...] "An important and often incompletely understood principle of radiography is the amount of bone destruction that goes undetected by routine x-rays procedures; this has been demonstrated by numerous investigators. Destruction confined to the cancellous portion of the bone cannot be detected radiographically, as radiolucencies appear only when there is internal or external erosion or destruction of the bone cortex." [...] In fact no radiographic findings are specific for bone infarction / osteonecrosis. A variety of pathologies may mimic bone infarction, including stress fractures, infections, inflammations, and metabolic and neoplastic processes. The limitations apply to all imaging modalities, including plain radiography, radionuclide studies, CT scans, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Through-transmission alveolar ultrasound, based on quantitative ultrasound (QUS) in combination with panoramic dental radiography (orthopantomography) is helpful in assessing changes in jawbone density. When practitioners have an up-to-date understanding of the disease process and a good anamnesis is combined with detailed clinical findings and course of events, the diagnosis, with the help of various imaging modality, can be achieved earlier, in most patients.|$|E

2500|$|Public {{opinion polls}} {{have shown a}} {{majority}} of the public supports various levels of government involvement in health care in the United States, with stated preferences depending on how the question is asked. Polls from Harvard University in 1988, the Los Angeles Times in 1990, and the Wall Street Journal in 1991 all showed strong support for a health care system compared to the system in Canada. [...] More recently, however, polling support has declined <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> health care system, with a 2007 Yahoo/AP poll showing a majority of respondents considered themselves supporters of [...] "single-payer health care," [...] a majority in favor of a number of reforms according to a joint poll with the Los Angeles Times and Bloomberg, and a plurality of respondents in a 2009 poll for Time Magazine showed support for [...] "a national single-payer plan similar to Medicare for all." [...] Polls by Rasmussen Reports in 2011 and 2012 showed pluralities opposed to single-payer health care. [...] Many other polls show support for various levels of government involvement in health care, including polls from New York Times/CBS News and Washington Post/ABC News, showing favorability for a form of national health insurance. [...] The Kaiser Family Foundation showed a majority in favor of a form of national health insurance, often compared to Medicare, and a Quinnipiac poll in three states in 2008 found majority support for the government ensuring [...] "that everyone in the United States has adequate health-care" [...] among likely Democratic primary voters.|$|E
