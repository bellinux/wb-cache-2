25|$|The old Stock <b>Exchange</b> <b>Tower</b> became largely {{redundant}} with Big Bang, which deregulated {{many of the}} Stock Exchange's {{activities as}} it enabled an increased use of computerised systems that allowed dealing rooms to take over work previously done by face-to-face trading. Thus in 2004 the Stock Exchange moved to a brand-new headquarters in Paternoster Square, close to St Paul's Cathedral.|$|E
25|$|The Clock Tower was {{conceived}} {{within five years}} of the completion of Herne Bay's first pier of 1832, when the town was {{in the throes of}} its initial popularity and development. Herne Bay historian Mike Bundock suggests a possible inspiration for the unusual design of this tower. On the back of 31 Marine Terrace, next door to Mrs Thwaytes' holiday residence, was a Royal Exchange Assurance lead firemark badge which bore a picture of the Royal <b>Exchange</b> <b>tower,</b> designed by Edward Jarman in 1721. Mrs Thwaytes was already familiar with the Royal <b>Exchange</b> <b>tower,</b> as she had lived close to it during her marriage. In 1836, possibly inspired by the success of the nearby pier and the grandeur of this image, Mrs Thwaytes requested the young architect Edwin James Dangerfield (1807–1879) of London and Herne Bay to draw a plan of a tower in the style of a Grecian temple with a clock at the top.|$|E

500|$|Early in 1929, Pflueger met Ralph Stackpole, an art {{professor}} at California School of Fine Arts {{and a former}} student of Mathews, who agreed to sculpt monumental figures for the stock exchange project as well as recommending and supervising other artists. Stackpole wrote later of his experience that [...] "the artists were in from the first. They were called in conference and assumed responsibility and personal pride in the building." [...] Pflueger hired nine artists to help decorate the neighboring Stock <b>Exchange</b> <b>Tower</b> at 155 Sansome, and instructed them only to keep their themes light and airy. Diego Rivera was brought with some difficulty from Mexico to paint a two-story mural in the stairwell between the 10th and 11th floors of the Stock Exchange Luncheon Club (now the City Club). Stackpole himself worked with a crew of assistants to direct carve heroic figures in stone above the tall 155 Sansome entrance, as well as carving two large sculpture groups flanking the Tuscan columns of 301 Pine Street.|$|E
