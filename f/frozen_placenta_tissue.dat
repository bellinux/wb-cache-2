40|$|AIM: To {{explore the}} {{feasibility}} of <b>placenta</b> <b>tissue</b> as a reliable and efficient source for generating mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). METHODS: MSC were generated from human <b>placenta</b> <b>tissue</b> by enzymatic digestion and mechanical dissociation. The placenta MSC (PLC-MSC) were characterized for expression of cell surface markers, embryonic stem cell (ECS) gene expression and their differentiation ability into adipocytes and osteocytes. The immunosuppressive properties of PLC-MSC on resting and phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulated allogenic T cells were assessed by means of cell proliferation via incorporation of tritium thymidine (3 H-TdR). RESULTS: The generated PLC-MSC appeared as spindle-shaped cells, expressed common MSC surface markers and ESC transcriptional factors. They also differentiated into adipogenic and osteogenic lineages when induced. However, continuous cultivation up to passage 15 caused changes in morphological appearance and cellular senescence, although the stem cell nature of their protein expression was unchanged. In terms of their immunosuppressive properties, PLC-MSC were unable to stimulate resting T cell proliferation; they inhibited the PHA stimulated T cells in a dose dependent manner through cell to cell contact. In our study, MSC generated from human placenta exhibited similar mesenchymal cell surface markers; MSC-like gene expression pattern and MSC-like differentiation potential were comparable to other sources of MSC. CONCLUSION: We suggest that <b>placenta</b> <b>tissues</b> can serve as an alternative source of MSC for future experimental and clinical studies...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{double-stranded}} RNA-dependent {{protein kinase}} PKR is an interferon-inducible enzyme that possesses antiviral and antiproliferative activities. We examined expression of PKR transcripts in human <b>placenta</b> <b>tissue</b> and cultured human amnion U cells. Alternative exon 2 structures {{were identified and}} characterized that possess different functional activities. Cloning and sequence analyses of 5 ′-RACE cDNAs from human placenta established a linkage between exon 1 and three alternative exon 2 structures that constitute, together with part of exon 3, the 5 ′-untranslated region of the PKR mRNA. The alternative splice variants of exon 2 were designated Ex 2 α (83 nucleotides), Ex 2 β (167 nucleotides), and Ex 2 γ (401 nucleotides). All three exon 2 variants were present in <b>placenta</b> <b>tissue.</b> However, only the Ex 2 α and Ex 2 β forms were detectable in the amnion U cell line. Nuclease protection analysis revealed that the Ex 2 β form was slightly more abundant than the Ex 2 α form, in both <b>placenta</b> <b>tissue</b> and U cells. Interferon treatment of U cells increased the level of both Ex 2 α and Ex 2 β RNA by ∼ 5 -fold.

40|$|Polybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers (PBDEs) are a {{class of}} brominated flame retardants (BFRs) that have been heavily used in consumer products such as furniture foams, plastics, and textiles since the mid- 1970 ’s. BFRs are added to products {{in order to meet}} state flammability standards intended to increase indoor safety {{in the event of a}} fire. The three commercial PBDE mixtures, Penta-, Octa-, and DecaBDE, have all been banned in the United States, however, limited use of DecaBDE is still permitted. PBDEs were phased out of production and added to the Stockholm Convention due to concerns over their environmental persistence and toxicity. Human exposure to PBDEs occurs primarily through the inadvertent ingestion of contaminated house dust, as well as though dietary sources. Despite the phase-out and discontinued use of PBDEs, human exposure to this class of chemicals is likely to continue for decades due to the continued use of treated products and existing environmental reservoirs of PBDEs. Extensive research over the years has shown that PBDEs disrupt thyroid hormone (TH) levels and neurodevelopmental endpoints in rodent and fish models. Additionally, there is growing epidemiological evidence linking PBDE exposure in humans to altered TH homeostasis and neurodevelopmental impairments in children. Due to the importance of THs throughout gestation, there is a great need to understand the effects of BFRs on the developing fetus. Specifically, the placenta plays a critical role in the transport, metabolism, and delivery of THs to the fetal compartment during pregnancy and is a likely target for BFR bioaccumulation and endocrine disruption. The central hypothesis of this dissertation research is that BFRs disrupt the activity of TH sulfotransferase (SULT) enzymes, thereby altering TH concentrations in the placenta. In the first aim of this dissertation research, the concentrations of PBDEs and 2, 4, 6 -TBP were measured in a cohort of 102 <b>placenta</b> <b>tissue</b> samples from an ongoing pregnancy cohort in Durham, NC. Methods were developed for the extraction and analysis of the BFR analytes. It was found that 2, 4, 6 -TBP was significantly correlated with all PBDE analytes, indicating that 2, 4, 6 -TBP may share common product applications with PBDEs or that 2, 4, 6 -TBP is a metabolite of PBDE compounds. Additionally, this was the first study to measure 2, 4, 6 -TBP in human <b>placenta</b> <b>tissues.</b> In the second aim of this dissertation research, the <b>placenta</b> <b>tissue</b> concentrations of THs, as well as the endogenous activity of deiodinase (DI) and TH SULT enzymes were quantified using the same cohort of 102 <b>placenta</b> <b>tissue</b> samples. Enzyme activity was detected in all samples and this was the first study to measure TH DI and SULT activity in human <b>placenta</b> <b>tissues.</b> Enzyme activities and TH concentrations were compared with BFR concentrations measured in Aim 1. There were few statistically significant associations observed for the combined data, however, upon stratifying the data set based on infant sex, additional significant associations were observed. For example, among males, those with the highest concentrations of BDE- 99 in placenta had T 3 levels 0. 80 times those with the lowest concentration of BDE- 99 (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 59, 1. 07). Whereas females with the highest concentrations of BDE- 99 in placenta had T 3 levels 1. 50 times those with the lowest concentration of BDE- 99 (95 % CI: 1. 10, 2. 04). Additionally, all BFR analyte concentrations were higher in the placenta of males versus females and they were significantly higher for 2, 4, 6 -TBP and BDE- 209. 3, 3 ’-T 2 SULT activity was significantly higher in female <b>placenta</b> <b>tissues,</b> while type 3 DI activity was significantly higher in male <b>placenta</b> <b>tissues.</b> This research is the first to show sex-specific differences in the bioaccumulation of BFRs in human <b>placenta</b> <b>tissue,</b> as well as differences in TH concentrations and endogenous DI and SULT activity. The underlying mechanisms of these observed sex differences warrant further investigation. In the third aim of this dissertation research, the effects of BFRs were examined in a human choriocarcinoma placenta cell line, BeWo. Michaelis-Menten parameters and inhibition curves were calculated for 2, 4, 6 -TBP, 3 -OH BDE- 47, and 6 -OH BDE- 47. 2, 4, 6 -TBP was shown to be the most potent inhibitor of 3, 3 ’-T 2 SULT activity with a calculated IC 50 value of 11. 6 nM. It was also shown that 2, 4, 6 -TBP and 3 -OH BDE- 47 exhibit mixed inhibition of 3, 3 ’-T 2 sulfation in BeWo cell homogenates. Next, a series of cell culture exposure experiments were performed using 1, 6, 12, and 24 hour exposure durations. Once again, 2, 4, 6 -TBP was shown to be the most potent inhibitor of basal 3, 3 ’-T 2 SULT activity by significantly decreasing activity at the high and medium dose (1 M and 0. 5 M, respectively) at all measured time points. Interestingly, BDE- 99 was also shown to inhibit basal 3, 3 ’-T 2 SULT activity in BeWo cells following the 24 hour exposure, despite exhibiting no inhibitory effects in the BeWo cell homogenate experiments. This indicates that BDE- 99 must act through a pathway other than direct enzyme inhibition. Following exposures, the TH concentrations in the cell culture growth media and mRNA expression of TH-related genes were also examined. There was no observed effect of BFR treatment on these endpoints. Future work should focus on determining the downstream biological effects of TH SULT disruption in placental cells, as well as the underlying mechanisms of action responsible for reductions in basal TH SULT activity following BFR exposure. This was one of the first studies to measure BFRs in a cohort of <b>placenta</b> <b>tissue</b> samples from the United States and the first study to measure THs, DI activity, and SULT activity in human <b>placenta</b> <b>tissues.</b> This research provides a novel contribution to our growing understanding of the effects of BFRs on TH homeostasis within the human placenta, and provides further evidence for sex-specific differences within this important organ. Future research should continue to investigate the effects of environmental contaminants on TH homeostasis within the placenta, as this represents the most critical and vulnerable stage of human development.

The levels of oxidative stress biomarkers Malondialdehyde (MDA), Nitric Oxide (NO), Superoxide dismutase (SOD), Catalase (CAT) and Gluthatione (GSH) in the supernatant of teased <b>placenta</b> <b>tissues</b> were determined by Colorimetric enzymatic assays. Parasitaemia was inversely related to haemoglobin levels and birth weight (P < 0. 001 and 0. 012, respectively). The level of lipid peroxide product (MDA) was significantly higher in the malaria infected (P = 0. 0047) and anaemic (P = 0. 024) women compared to their non-infected and non-anaemic counterparts, respectively. A similar trend was observed with SOD levels, though not significant. The levels of MDA also correlated positively with parasitaemia (P = 0. 0024) but negatively with haemoglobin levels (P = 0. 002). There was no association between parasitaemia, haemoglobin level and the other oxidative stress biomarkers. From histological studies, levels of MDA associated positively and significantly with placenta malaria infection {{and the presence of}} malaria pigments. The levels of SOD, NO and CAT increased with decreasing leukocyte accumulation in the intervillous space. Baby birth weight increased significantly with SOD and CAT levels, but decreased with levels of GSH. Placental P. falciparum infection may cause oxidative stress of the <b>placenta</b> <b>tissue</b> with MDA as a potential biomarker of PM, which alongside GSH could lead to poor pregnancy outcomes (anaemia and low birth weight).

40|$|There {{are only}} a few reports on the {{histology}} of placental tissue of pregnancies from mothers with Fabry disease. Fabry disease is a lysosomal disorder caused by alpha-galactosidase A deficiency. Extensive glycosphingolipid (GSL) accumulation in fetal and maternal <b>placenta</b> <b>tissue</b> obtained from a Fabry mother and her affected male newborn has previously been reported. Here we report the evaluation of <b>placenta</b> <b>tissue</b> of two pregnancies in Fabry mothers, one of an unaffected male newborn (placenta A) and one of an affected female newborn (placenta B). The mother of the female affected offspring was treated with recombinant alpha-galactosidase A (enzyme replacement therapy. ERT) during the pregnancy (placenta B). Storage material was only detected in smooth muscle cells of the umbilical cord of placenta B. No accumulation was seen in both placentae. Combing these results with the outcome in two earlier described placentae, a heterogeneous picture emerges. This may be due to differences in disease severity in the mothers or severity of disease in their offspring. In addition, a possible effect of ERT on placental GSL accumulation could also explain lack of GSL storage in placenta B. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserve...|$|R

40|$|Our {{study was}} {{designed}} to establish whether air pollution in urbanized industrial centers of southern Poland affects the process of glycosylation in a full-term human placenta. This process of glycosylation was analyzed by the quantitative determination of the binding of WGA and LCA lectins to placental villi. The study was performed on human placentas collected in 1990 - 91 and 2000 - 01 in regions of southern Poland differing in their degree of environmental pollution: the highly polluted areas of Upper Silesia and Cracow agglomeration. The Bieszczady area with low pollution was considered the control. The concentrations of nitrogen and sulfur oxides and the concentration of aerosols were used as markers of the degree of air pollution. The direct immunofluorescence reaction of the <b>placenta</b> <b>tissues</b> with fluorescein-labeled (FITC) lec-tins was used. The staining of the <b>placenta</b> <b>tissues</b> was examined under a fluorescence microscope linked to an analysis system. A microdensytometric method was used to assay the amount of tissue-bound lectins. The results showed no significant effect of the three main air pollutants in the study areas in southern Poland, i. e. nitrogen and sulfur oxides and high level of aerosols, on the structure of WGA-and LCA-specific glycoconjugates in human placenta.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Miscarriage (early {{pregnancy}} failure) is a pregnancy-related disease, the pathophysiology {{of which}} is still not completely understood. Lipid peroxidation and alterations in antioxidant enzyme activities may be of importance in the pathogenesis of this disorder. This study was planned to investigate the possible relation betweenfree radical scavenging enzyme activities and lipid peroxidation levels in <b>placenta</b> <b>tissues</b> with miscarriage. METHODS: Placental tissue samples were obtainedfrom 2 1 patients who had miscarried and 25 normal pregnant women undergoing elective abortion as a control group. Total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px,), and catalase (CAT) enzyme activities and levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive stbstanices (TBARS), antioxidant potential (A OP), and nonienzymatic superoxide radical scavenger activity (NSSA) were measured in the placental tissues. RESULTS: GSH-Px, CAT activities and TBARS levels werefound to be signfficantly increased, while T-SOD and NSSA values decreased in patients with early pregnancy fildure when compared with women undergoing elective abortion (control group,). However, {{there were no significant}} diferences in AOP levels between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reflect oxidative stress in <b>placenta</b> <b>tissues</b> of early pregnancy failure, as the oxidative processes seemv to be counteracted by the physiologic activation of antioxidant enzymes such as CAT and GSH-Px. Moreover, a conpensatory} mnechanism might be developed against possible oxidativ...|$|R

Female patients {{were recruited from}} the Antenatal Clinic of Dolu Specialist Hospital, Mafoluku, Oshodi, Lagos, between 2008 and 2012. A total of 48 normal term placentas and 15 placentas of known IUGR cases were used for this study. IUGR cases were confirmed {{on the basis of}} ultrasound follow-up and diagnosis. Normal term placentas were collected at the point of delivery by a consultant gynaecologist, the cords were clamped, and membranes were then carefully trimmed after which each placenta was weighed. About 1 [*]cm thickness of both normal and growth retarded <b>placenta</b> <b>tissues</b> was cut, processed for hematoxylin and eosin stain, while tissues for enzyme (ALP) assay were homogenized in cold 0. 5 [*]M sucrose solution. Comparative analysis of the data was done using ANOVA; P< 0. 05 was taken as significant. The photomicrographs were observed/studied under light microscope, using the X 150 and X 600 magnifications. It was revealed therein that placental tissues are homogenous (regionally), compromised of maternal spiral arterioles and deregulated villous vasculogenesis, {{and that there is a}} significant difference in the level of alkaline phosphatase enzyme.

40|$|Pregnancy-{{associated}} malaria (PAM) {{is associated}} with placenta pathology and poor pregnancy outcome but the mechanisms that control the malaria parasite expansion in pregnancy are still poorly understood and not amenable for study in human subjects. Here, we used a set of new tools to re-visit an experimental mouse model of pregnancy-induced malaria recrudescence, BALB/c with chronic Plasmodium berghei infection. During pregnancy 60 % of the pre-exposed primiparous females showed pregnancy-induced malaria recrudescence and we demonstrated that the recrudescent P. berghei show an unexpected enhancement of the adherence to <b>placenta</b> <b>tissue</b> sections with a marked specificity for CSA. Furthermore, we showed that the intensity of parasitemia in primigravida was quantitatively correlated with the degree of thickening of the placental tissue and up-regulation of inflammation-related genes such as IL 10. We also confirmed {{that the incidence of}} pregnancy-induced recrudescence, the intensity of the parasitemia peak and the impact on the pregnancy outcome decreased gradually from the first to the third pregnancy. Interestingly, placenta pathology and fetal impairment were also observed at low frequency among non-recrudescent females. Together, the data raise the hypothesis that recrudescent P. berghei displays selected specificity for the <b>placenta</b> <b>tissue</b> enabling on one hand, the triggering of the pathological process underlying PAM and on the other hand, the induction of PAM protection mechanisms that are revealed in subsequent pregnancies. Thus, by exploiting P. berghei pregnancy-induced recrudescence, this experimenta...|$|R

40|$|Objective 　To {{establish}} a pregnant mouse model infected with Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. g), and investigate {{the relationship of}} P. g infection to prematurity and associated birth abnormalities. Methods 　Fifty two female mice were randomly divided into P. g infection group (n= 26) and control group (n= 26). Mice in P. g infection group were anesthetized, the pulp cavity of the first molar was opened and directly injected with W 83 strain P. g, and the tooth was then filled. Six weeks after infection, the mice were mated with males {{and the formation of}} vagina plug was recorded as 0 d. The P. g extracted from the granulation tissue in tooth root was cultivated. The pregnant days and the connatal body weight of infant mouse were recorded, the serum and placental tissue were collected to assess the systemic and local conditions during pregnancy. Results 　After periodontal P. g infection, the TNF-α, IL- 17, IL - 6 and IL - 1 βlevels in peripheral blood sera increased significantly. The average gestation was shorter in P. g infection group (18. 25 d) than in control group (20. 45 d, P< 0. 01), and the connatal body weight of infant mouse was also less in the former than in the latter (P< 0. 01). Immunohistochemistry and PCR revealed the existence of P. g in <b>placenta</b> <b>tissue.</b> P. g infection caused premature rupture of membranes, placental abruption, degeneration and necrosis of trophoblastic and endothelial cells; significantly increased the number of neutrophils and macrophages in <b>placenta</b> <b>tissues,</b> and increased the expression of local TNF-αand COX- 2 inflammatory factors at the same time. In P. g infection group, the expressions of CD- 31 in endothelial cells of <b>placenta</b> <b>tissues</b> and the apoptotic factor caspase- 3 decreased, and the DNA oxidative damage index 8 -OHdG increased. Conclusions 　P. g infection in female mice may cause premature birth and lower connatal body weight of infant mouse, and increase the expression of serous and local inflammatory factors in the placenta. It is suggested that timely removal of periodontitis or gingivitis can prevent some of reproductive abnormalities. 		 		DOI: 10. 11855 /j. issn. 0577 - 7402. 2016. 08. 0...|$|R
30|$|A second {{explanation}} {{could be}} {{the presence of an}} infection or inflammation. The prolonged presence of <b>placenta</b> <b>tissue</b> in the uterine cavity could enhance infection. Infection is a known situation with enhancement of adhesion formation [4]. In 56 % of the patients after puerperium curettage, performed in the second to fourth week during puerperium, histological examination shows the presence of acute, subacute, or chronic inflammation without symptoms that would suggest endometritis [15]. Low estrogen state, including the puerperium, seems to significantly increase the risk of developing adhesions [12]. Lactation, also being a hypoestrogenic condition, could be an important additional factor in adhesion formation.|$|R
