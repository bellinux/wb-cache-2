Peter Shapiro, writing in The Times, {{summed up the}} album's musical influences as [...] "anything {{as long as it}} has a beat". Some tracks drew on Tamil film music, which M.I.A. listened to while growing up. Shapiro described her music as a [...] "multi-genre pile-up" [...] and likened it to her graphic art, calling it [...] "vivid, gaudy, lo-fi and deceptively candyfloss". In a 2005 interview, when asked about the difficulty in categorising her sound, M.I.A. explained, [...] "Influences are crossing over into each other's puddles.

50|$|Neuronal {{ensembles}} encode {{information in}} a way somewhat similar {{to the principle of}} Wikipedia operation - multiple edits by many participants. Neuroscientists have discovered that individual neurons are very noisy. For example, by examining the activity of only a single neuron in the visual cortex, {{it is very difficult to}} reconstruct the visual scene that the owner of the brain is looking at. Like a single Wikipedia participant, an individual neuron does not 'know' everything and is likely to make mistakes. This problem is solved by the brain having billions of neurons. Information processing by the brain is population processing, and it is also distributed - in many cases each neuron <b>knows</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> about everything, and the more neurons participate in a job, the more precise the information encoding. In the distributed processing scheme, individual neurons may exhibit neuronal noise, but the population as a whole averages this noise out.|$|R

50|$|An inattentive person won't remark {{anything}} {{but will be}} shallow everywhere.

Such people only hear half of everything; they memorize or inform only half of it or do it in a messy manner. According to a proverb they generally <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of all and nothing of the whole…. They are mostly reckless, often copious considering imprudent projects, but they are also most inconstant in execution. They treat everything in a light manner since they are not attentive enough to feel denigration or disadvantages.|$|E

And then I just thought, I kind of want a hobby, since husband Chris has been shooting a lot. So I started asking around to some friends, and I asked this technical producer guy what equipment I should buy on Amazon. And I just started recording my friends when they would come over. And then with my dear friend Sim, we started flushing out the whole thing, which clearly there’s still a lot more flushing out to do. It started out as a dinky hobby. It still is, for sure—we don’t make any money. We would love to at some point, but we want to <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more what we’re doing first.|$|E

5000|$|The {{availability}} of the TCP-hole-punching technique depends {{on the type of}} computer port allocation used by the NAT.For two peers behind a NAT to connect to each other via , they need to <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> about each other. One thing that they absolutely need to know is the [...] "location" [...] of the other peer, or the remote endpoint. The remote endpoint is the data of the IP address and a port that the peer will connect to. So when two peers, A and B, initiate TCP connections by binding to local ports Pa and Pb, respectively, they need to know the remote endpoint port as mapped by the NAT {{in order to make the}} connection.Here comes the crux of the problem: if both peers are behind a NAT, how does one guess what is the public remote endpoint of the other peer? This problem is called NAT port prediction. All TCP NAT traversal and Hole Punching techniques have to solve the port prediction problem.|$|E

With more contextual information about the user, the program is able to schedule more effectively by helping two diverse personalities, the judger and the perceiver, become more like each other. Thus, by adding just a tiny bit of context to a normal, simple scheduling program, a user can adjust his / her habits to become more successful in life...|$|R
