5|$|During the 18th century, the {{imperial}} library was constituted, but excluded virtually all Taoist books.

5|$|Armenians from Lebanon, {{where they}} had {{effectively}} established an active community, are more politicized, while Turkish Armenians are mostly connected with the Armenian Apostolic Church. About 1/3 of all Turkish Armenians in America are self-employed. A group of Armenian Americans from Istanbul founded the Organization of Istanbul Armenians (OIA) in 1976, which claimed over 1,000 members in Southern California as of 2011. Iranian Armenians are known for fast integration into American society; for <b>example,</b> <b>only</b> 31% of Armenian Americans born in Iran claim not to speak English well.|$|E
5|$|Direct {{precipitation}} {{of sodium}} salts from aqueous solutions is rare because sodium salts typically {{have a high}} affinity for water; an exception is sodium bismuthate (NaBiO3). Because of this, sodium salts are usually isolated as solids by evaporation or by precipitation with an organic solvent, such as ethanol; for <b>example,</b> <b>only</b> 0.35g/L of sodium chloride will dissolve in ethanol. Crown ethers, like 15-crown-5, {{may be used as}} a phase-transfer catalyst.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{due to its}} {{northern}} location, the peninsula's population had been sparse: in 1913, for <b>example,</b> <b>only</b> about 13,000–15,000 people lived there; mostly along the shores. However, {{the discovery of the}} vast natural resource deposits and industrialization efforts led to an explosive population growth during the Soviet times. By 1970, the population of the peninsula was around 799,000. The trend reverted in the 1990s, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The population of the whole Murmansk Oblast went down from 1,150,000 in 1989 to 890,000 in 2002 to 795,000 in 2010.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013, Network World tested eight {{social media}} {{management}} tools. The reviewer found that Viralheat {{was the lowest}} cost, and supported more social media sites than competitors, but lacked the features to support multi-user accounts needed for large (enterprise) customers. The reviewer also praised Viralheat for its user interface and easy cross-posting across different social networks, but said its reporting and analytics were limited. For <b>example,</b> <b>only</b> three date-ranges could be selected when generating a report.|$|E
5|$|Much of Shen Kuo's written {{work was}} {{probably}} purged {{under the leadership}} of minister Cai Jing (1046–1126), who revived the New Policies of Wang Anshi, although he set out on a campaign of attrition to destroy or radically alter the written work of his predecessors and especially Conservative enemies. For <b>example,</b> <b>only</b> six of Shen's books remain, and four of these have been significantly altered since the time they were penned by the author.|$|E

5|$|Water {{supply and}} {{sanitation}} in Colombia has been improved {{in many ways}} over the past decades. Between 1990 and 2010, access to improved sanitation increased from 67% to 82%, but access to improved water source's increased only slightly from 89% to 94%. In particular, coverage in rural areas lags behind. Furthermore, despite improvements, the quality of water and sanitation services remains inadequate. For <b>example,</b> <b>only</b> 73% of those receiving public services receive water of potable quality and in 2006 only 25% of the wastewater generated in the country underwent any kind of treatment.|$|E
5|$|Ferrier's discography {{consists}} of studio recordings originally {{made on the}} Columbia and Decca labels, and recordings taken from live performances which were later issued as discs. In the years since her death, many of her recordings have received multiple reissues on modern media; between 1992 and 1996 Decca issued the Kathleen Ferrier Edition, incorporating much of Ferrier's recorded repertoire, on 10 compact discs. The discographer Paul Campion has drawn attention to numerous works which she performed but did not record, or for which no complete recording has yet surfaced. For <b>example,</b> <b>only</b> one aria from Elgar's Dream of Gerontius, and none of her renderings of 20th century songs by Holst, Bax, Delius and others were recorded. Only {{a small part of}} her St John Passion was captured on disc.|$|E
5|$|Fisheries {{also have}} {{negative}} effects on seabirds, and these effects, particularly on the long-lived and slow-breeding albatrosses, {{are a source of}} increasing concern to conservationists. The bycatch of seabirds entangled in nets or hooked on fishing lines has had a big impact on seabird numbers; for example, an estimated 100,000 albatrosses are hooked and drown each year on tuna lines set out by long-line fisheries. Overall, many hundreds of thousands of birds are trapped and killed each year, a source of concern for some of the rarest species (for <b>example,</b> <b>only</b> about 2,000 short-tailed albatrosses are known to still exist). Seabirds are also thought to suffer when overfishing occurs.|$|E

This goes in fact beyond learning from positive <b>examples</b> <b>only.</b> In this paper, a parameter estimation method for a wrapper based on (k, l) contextual tree languages is introduced that is solely based on a few positive examples. Experiments show {{that the quality of}} the wrappers is very close to that of wrappers with the optimal parameter setting. ...|$|R

5|$|From the 17th century onwards, some keeps were {{deliberately}} destroyed. In England, {{many were}} destroyed {{after the end}} of the Second English Civil War in 1649, when Parliament took steps to prevent another royalist uprising by slighting, or damaging, castles so as to prevent them from having any further military utility. Slighting was quite expensive and took considerable effort to carry out, so damage was usually done in the most cost efficient fashion with only selected walls being destroyed. Keeps were singled out for particular attention in this process because of their continuing political and cultural importance, and the prestige they lent their former royalist owners – at Kenilworth, for <b>example,</b> <b>only</b> the keep was slighted, and at Raglan, the keep was the main focus of parliamentary activity. There was some equivalent destruction of keeps in France in the 17th and 18th centuries, such as the slighting of Montaiguillon by Cardinal Richelieu in 1624, but the catalogue of damage was far less than that of the 1640s and early 1650s in England.|$|E
5|$|Geometric {{designs on}} pottery {{of the eighth}} century BC depict scenes from the Trojan cycle, {{as well as the}} adventures of Heracles. These visual {{representations}} of myths are important for two reasons. Firstly, many Greek myths are attested on vases earlier than in literary sources: of the twelve labors of Heracles, for <b>example,</b> <b>only</b> the Cerberus adventure occurs in a contemporary literary text. Secondly, visual sources sometimes represent myths or mythical scenes that are not attested in any extant literary source. In some cases, the first known representation of a myth in geometric art predates its first known representation in late archaic poetry, by several centuries. In the Archaic (c. 750–c. 500 BC), Classical (c. 480–323 BC), and Hellenistic (323–146 BC) periods, Homeric and various other mythological scenes appear, supplementing the existing literary evidence.|$|E

50|$|So {{important}} is pottery to the archaeology of prehistoric cultures that many are known by names taken from their distinctive, and often very fine, pottery, {{such as the}} Linear Pottery culture, Beaker culture, Globular Amphora culture, Corded Ware culture and Funnelbeaker culture, to take <b>examples</b> <b>only</b> from Neolithic Europe (approximately 70001800BCE).|$|R
25|$|Smallpox {{epidemics}} {{and sleeping}} sickness also devastated the disrupted population. By 1896, African trypanosomiasis had killed up to 5,000 Africans {{in the village}} of Lukolela on the Congo River.

25|$|No {{specific}} actions {{take place at}} the beginning of combat step. This step mainly exists to allow players to cast spells and activate abilities that may alter how combat progresses.

25|$|Facies can be {{distinguished}} {{in a number of}} ways: the most common are by the lithology (for example: limestone, siltstone or sandstone) or by fossil content.

Facies determined by lithology are called lithofacies; facies determined by fossils are biofacies.|$|E
25|$|At 2 years, infants show {{first signs}} of phonological awareness, i.e., they are {{interested}} in word play, rhyming, and alliterations. Phonological awareness does continue to develop until the first years of school. For <b>example,</b> <b>only</b> about half of the 4- and 5-year olds tested by Liberman et al. (1974) were able to tap out the number of syllables in multisyllabic words, but 90% of the 6-year-olds were able to do so.|$|E
25|$|In {{striking}} {{contrast to}} the Jacobite losses, the government losses were 50 dead and 259 wounded.
