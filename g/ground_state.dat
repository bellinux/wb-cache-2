5|$|A {{lawrencium}} atom has 103 electrons, {{of which}} three {{can act as}} valence electrons. In 1970, {{it was predicted that}} the ground-state electron configuration of lawrencium was 5f146d17s2 (<b>ground</b> <b>state</b> term symbol 2D3/2), following the Aufbau principle and conforming to the 4f145d16s2 configuration of lawrencium's lighter homolog lutetium. However, the next year, calculations were published that questioned this prediction, instead expecting an anomalous 5f147s27p1 configuration. Though early calculations gave conflicting results, more recent studies and calculations confirm the s2p suggestion. 1974 relativistic calculations concluded that the energy difference between the two configurations was small and that it was uncertain which was the <b>ground</b> <b>state.</b> Later 1995 calculations concluded that the s2p configuration should be energetically favored, because the spherical s and p1/2 orbitals are nearest to the atomic nucleus and thus move quickly enough that their relativistic mass increases significantly.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{tantalum}} {{consists of}} two isotopes: 180mTa (0.012%) and 181Ta (99.988%). 181Ta is a stable isotope. 180mTa (m denotes a metastable state) is predicted to decay in three ways: isomeric transition to the <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> of 180Ta, beta decay to 180W, or electron capture to 180Hf. However, radioactivity of this nuclear isomer has never been observed, and only a lower limit on its half-life of 2.0×1016years has been set. The <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> of 180Ta has a half-life of only 8 hours. 180mTa is the only naturally occurring nuclear isomer (excluding radiogenic and cosmogenic short-living nuclides). It is also the rarest isotope in the Universe, {{taking into account the}} elemental abundance of tantalum and isotopic abundance of 180mTa in the natural mixture of isotopes (and again excluding radiogenic and cosmogenic short-living nuclides).|$|E

5|$|The stable group 11 elements, copper, silver, and gold, {{all have}} an outer {{electron}} configuration nd10(n+1)s1. For {{each of these}} elements, the first excited state of their atoms has a configuration nd9(n+1)s2. Due to spin-orbit coupling between the d electrons, this state is split {{into a pair of}} energy levels. For copper, the difference in energy between the <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> and lowest excited state causes the metal to appear reddish. For silver, the energy gap widens and it becomes silvery. However, as the atomic number increases, the excited levels are stabilized by relativistic effects and in gold the energy gap decreases again and it appears gold. For roentgenium, calculations indicate that the 6d97s2 level is stabilized {{to such an extent that}} it becomes the <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> and the 6d107s1 level becomes the first excited state. The resulting energy difference between the new <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> and the first excited state is similar to that of silver and roentgenium is expected to be silvery in appearance.

In particular we present probability distributions for parity, seniority, spectroscopic (i. e., in the laboratory framework) quadrupole moments and α clustering in the <b>ground</b> <b>states.</b> We find that the probability distribution for the parity of the <b>ground</b> <b>states</b> obtained by a two-body random ensemble simulates that of realistic nuclei: positive parity is dominant in the <b>ground</b> <b>states</b> of even-even nuclei while for odd-odd nuclei and odd-mass nuclei we obtain with almost equal probability <b>ground</b> <b>states</b> with positive and negative parity. In addition we find that for the <b>ground</b> <b>states,</b> assuming pure random interactions, low seniority is not favored, no dominance of positive values of spectroscopic quadrupole deformation, and no sign of α-cluster correlations, all in sharp contrast to realistic nuclei. Considering a mixture of a random and a realistic interaction, we observe a second order phase transition for the α-cluster correlation probability. Comment: 7 page...|$|R

40|$|Monte Carlo {{simulation}} techniques, like {{simulated annealing}} and parallel tempering, {{are often used}} to evaluate low-temperature properties and find <b>ground</b> <b>states</b> of disordered systems. Here we compare these methods using direct calculations of <b>ground</b> <b>states</b> for three-dimensional Ising diluted antiferromagnets in a field (DAFF) and three-dimensional Ising spin glasses (ISG). For the DAFF, we find that, with respect to obtaining <b>ground</b> <b>states,</b> parallel tempering is superior to simple Monte-Carlo and to simulated annealing. However, equilibration becomes more difficult with increasing magnitude of the externally applied field.
