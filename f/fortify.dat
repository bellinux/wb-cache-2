5|$|According to Yuri Moshnik, {{a modern}} historian, the {{garrison}} at Viborg in 1710 stood at 6000 men; other modern historians B. Adamovich and A. I. Dubravin {{put the number}} at 4000. Since 1702, the commander there had been Zacharias Animoff, who was old and in poor health. For that reason, in February 1710, Colonel Magnus Stiernstråle officially replaced him; he had de facto headed the efforts to <b>fortify</b> the city.|$|E
5|$|Asser's Life omits {{any mention}} of {{internal}} strife or dissent in Alfred's own reign, though when he mentions that Alfred had to harshly punish those who were slow to obey Alfred's commands to <b>fortify</b> the realm, he {{makes it clear that}} Alfred did have to enforce obedience. Asser's life is a one-sided treatment of Alfred, though since Alfred was alive when it was composed, it is unlikely to contain gross errors of fact.|$|E
5|$|During Gage's {{administration}} political tensions rose {{throughout the}} American colonies. As a result, Gage began withdrawing {{troops from the}} frontier to <b>fortify</b> urban centres like New York City and Boston. As the number of soldiers stationed in cities grew, {{the need to provide}} adequate food and housing for these troops became urgent. Parliament passed the Quartering Act of 1765, permitting British troops to be quartered in vacant houses, barns, and outbuildings, but not private residences.|$|E

However, <b>fortified</b> rice has to have acceptable organoleptic-the sensory properties of a particular food-qualities. Few data exist on the acceptability of <b>fortified</b> rice in Asia. To assess the acceptability of two types of <b>fortified</b> rice (cold and hot extruded) in Vietnam and Cambodia, triangle tests were conducted in Vietnam (53 women) and Cambodia (258 adults), testing <b>fortified</b> rice against conventional rice, with participants being asked to score the organoleptic qualities. In addition, Cambodian schoolchildren (n = 1700) were given conventional rice and two types of <b>fortified</b> rice for two week periods as part of a World Food Program school meal program, with intake monitored. <b>Fortified</b> rice differed significantly in organoleptic qualities from conventional rice, with most subjects correctly identifying <b>fortified</b> rice (P < 0. 001). However, <b>fortified</b> rice was found to be highly acceptable in both countries. In Cambodia, schoolchildren consuming <b>fortified</b> rice had higher intakes than when consuming conventional rice (176 g/child/day and 168 g/child/day, respectively; P < 0. 05). This study shows that <b>fortified</b> rice is acceptable in two countries in Southeast Asia. However, specific information is needed to explain the organoleptic qualities of <b>fortified</b> rice as perceived by end-users...|$|R

5|$|In January 1863, the {{regiment}} received orders to <b>fortify</b> their camp outside of New Bern. The improved camp was named Fort Peirson {{in honor of}} their commanding officer.

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, concerns grew in the British government about the threat of German invasion along the east coast of England. The bays just to the north of Dunstanburgh Castle were vulnerable targets for an enemy amphibious landing, and efforts were made to <b>fortify</b> the castle and the surrounding area in 1940, as part of a wider line of defences erected by Sir Edmund Ironside.|$|E

5|$|Cassel was {{annexed to}} France the {{following}} year {{under the terms of}} the Treaty of Nijmegen, which ended the war. The annexation led to the town's defences being dismantled; it was considered indefensible, as it was within easy firing range of the nearby Mont des Récollets, and it would have cost far too much to <b>fortify</b> both hills. In addition, the revised frontier following the treaty was now a significant distance from Cassel and without the proximity of the border, the town was no longer seen as having much strategic significance.|$|E

In May 1889, Jingyuen and the Beiyang Fleet were moved to <b>fortify</b> Weihaiwei (now Weihai). During the summer of that year, she was part of the flotilla led by Admiral Ding Ruchang, which travelled to Chefoo (now Yantai), Chemlupo (now Incheon, South Korea), and the Imperial Russian Navy base of Vladivostok. On the return leg of the journey, they stopped at Fusan (now Busan, South Korea).|$|E
5|$|Henry VIII {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of an artillery blockhouse at East Tilbury in 1539–40 as part of a major scheme to <b>fortify</b> the coastline of England and Wales. It followed his break from the Pope and the Catholic Church, which led to fears that the Catholic powers of Europe would seek to invade so as to reimpose Papal authority. Five blockhouses were built along the Thames between Gravesend and Higham – two on the north bank at Tilbury and East Tilbury and three on the south bank at Gravesend, Milton (near the present New Tavern Fort) and Higham.|$|E

Seeking to trap Arnold between Lafayette's army and a French naval detachment, Washington sought the Admiral Chevalier Destouches, {{the commander of the}} French fleet at Newport for help.

5|$|In {{order to}} avert having {{to conduct a}} war on two fronts, Domitian agreed to terms of peace with Decebalus, {{negotiating}} free access of Roman troops through the Dacian region while granting Decebalus an annual subsidy of 8 million sesterces. Contemporary authors severely criticized this treaty, which was considered shameful to the Romans and left the deaths of Sabinus and Fuscus unavenged. For the remainder of Domitian's reign Dacia remained a relatively peaceful client kingdom, but Decebalus used the Roman money to <b>fortify</b> his defenses.|$|E
