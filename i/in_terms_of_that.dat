25|$|Many {{mathematical}} objects, such as sets {{of numbers}} and functions, exhibit internal structure {{as a consequence of}} operations or relations that are defined on the set. Mathematics then studies properties of those sets that can be expressed <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> structure; for instance number theory studies properties of the set of integers that can be expressed in terms of arithmetic operations. Moreover, it frequently happens that different such structured sets (or structures) exhibit similar properties, which makes it possible, by a further step of abstraction, to state axioms for a class of structures, and then study at once the whole class of structures satisfying these axioms. Thus one can study groups, rings, fields and other abstract systems; together such studies (for structures defined by algebraic operations) constitute the domain of abstract algebra.|$|E

Rifkin connects the qualitative changes in energy regimes and communication techniques with changes in how people understand and organize reality. Hunter-gatherer societies were all oral cultures and thus only existed in geographically-limited small groups and identified themselves symbiotically <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> group. Spiritually, these societies believed in local gods who were only known to others through oral tales. The development of writing, as well as hydraulics and irrigation, allowed agricultural societies to better organize themselves so that a larger geographic area and a larger population could be controlled. Hydraulic power was labour-intensive, requiring large populations of subservient people. With scripts, there was a shift from [...] a mythological consciousness to a theological consciousness; individuals thought of themselves less {{in terms of a}} small, local group and more with a monotheistic religion which included a personal relationship with a god.|$|E

500|$|Inside Soap editor, Steven Murphy, {{said that}} the fact Pauline has been such an [...] "enduring staple" [...] will {{make it hard for}} fans to cope with her departure. [...] "It's huge in soap terms... She's a {{character}} people love to hate—you just assumed she would be there forever." [...] When addressing the repercussions that Pauline's exit would have on the soap, Murphy had this to say: [...] "characters like Pauline are like glue, because they're connected to so many other characters and they can help hold stories together. <b>In</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> [...] has very few of those now." [...] Jonathan Hughes, editor of All About Soap magazine, added [...] " [...] an absolute legend... You can't imagine the show without her...

[...] However, not all viewers were sorry to hear of the character's retirement, with one commenting [...] "How can you have someone like Pauline Fowler on the television for 21 years? It's the best thing that's ever happened to television [...] Kill her off? I would have blown her up years ago".|$|E

[...] The painting lacks the sentimental rhetoric that was expected in a genre work: Courbet's mourners make no theatrical gestures of grief, and their faces seemed more caricatured than ennobled. The critics accused Courbet of a deliberate pursuit of ugliness.|$|E
2500|$|In {{functional}} analysis and related areas of mathematics, locally convex topological vector spaces or locally convex spaces {{are examples of}} topological vector spaces (TVS) that generalize normed spaces. They {{can be defined as}} topological vector spaces whose topology is generated by translations of balanced, absorbent, convex sets. [...] Alternatively they can be defined as a vector space with a family of seminorms, and a topology can be defined <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> family. [...] Although in general such spaces are not necessarily normable, the existence of a convex local base for the zero vector is strong enough for the Hahn–Banach theorem to hold, yielding a sufficiently rich theory of continuous linear functionals.|$|E

2500|$|The {{essential}} idea of [...] "fractured" [...] dimensions has a {{long history}} in mathematics, but the term itself was brought to the fore by Benoit Mandelbrot based on his 1967 paper on self-similarity in which he discussed fractional dimensions. In that paper, Mandelbrot cited previous work by Lewis Fry Richardson describing the counter-intuitive notion that a coastline's measured length changes with the length of the measuring stick used (see Fig. 1). <b>In</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> notion, the fractal dimension of a coastline quantifies how the number of scaled measuring sticks required to measure the coastline changes with the scale applied to the stick. There are several formal mathematical definitions of fractal dimension that build on this basic concept of change in detail with change in scale.|$|E
2500|$|Pornography is a {{legal term}} at the federal level, except the generic terms [...] "hardcore pornography" [...] and [...] "child pornography", do not exist after the 1973 Miller v. California case. The United States Supreme Court in Miller v. California {{discussed}} pornography (which it referred to as [...] "sexually explicit material") in terms of obscenity, which it held did not enjoy First Constitutional Amendment protection, and recognized that individual communities had different values and opinions on obscenity. The Court's definition of obscenity {{has come to be}} called the Miller test. Since then several States have passed laws <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> test. Relying on the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act and under the terms [...] "obscene" [...] and [...] "", the U.S. Customs and Border Protection prohibits the importation of any pornographic material ( [...] "Immoral articles; importation prohibited").|$|E
2500|$|In physics, {{as well as}} mathematics, a vector {{is often}} {{identified}} with a tuple of components, or list of numbers, that act as scalar coefficients {{for a set of}} basis vectors. When the basis is transformed, for example by rotation or stretching, then the components of any vector <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> basis also transform in an opposite sense. The vector itself has not changed, but the basis has, so the components of the vector must change to compensate. The vector is called covariant or contravariant depending on how the transformation of the vector's components is related to the transformation of the basis. In general, contravariant vectors are [...] "regular vectors" [...] with units of distance (such as a displacement) or distance times some other unit (such as velocity or acceleration); covariant vectors, on the other hand, have units of one-over-distance such as gradient. If you change units (a special case of a change of basis) from meters to millimeters, a scale factor of 1/1000, a displacement of 1m becomes 1000mm–a contravariant change in numerical value. In contrast, a gradient of 1K/m becomes 0.001K/mm–a covariant change in value. See covariance and contravariance of vectors. Tensors are another type of quantity that behave in this way; a vector is one type of tensor.|$|E

2500|$|The {{action of}} Middlemarch takes place [...] "between September 1829 and May 1832" [...] or forty {{years prior to}} its {{publication}} during 1871–2, a gap in time not so pronounced {{for it to be}} regularly labelled as a historical novel; by comparison, Walter Scott's Waverley (1814)—often regarded as the first major historical novel—takes place some sixty years before its publication. Eliot had previously written a more obviously historical novel in Romola (1862–63), set in fifteenth-century Florence. The critics Kathleen Blake and Michael York Mason opine that there has been insufficient attention given to Middlemarch [...] "as a historical novel that evokes the past in relation to the present". The critic Rosemary Ashton notes that the lack of attention to this aspect of the novel might indicate its merits in this regard: [...] " [...] is that very rare thing, a successful historical novel. In fact, it is so successful that we scarcely think of it <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> subgenre of fiction". For its contemporary readership, the present [...] "was the passage of the Second Reform Act in 1867"; the agitation for the Reform Act of 1832 and its turbulent passage through the two Houses of Parliament, which provide the basic structure of the novel, would have been considered the past.|$|E
