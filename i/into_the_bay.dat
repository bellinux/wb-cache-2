5|$|Every second, {{approximately}} 28 cubed {{meters of}} water flows <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bay.</b> The exchange with the Gulf of Mexico occurs at Cedar Bayou and Aransas Pass. As {{a result of}} the seawater exchange, the bay's salinity is 15 parts per thousand, compared to the seawater average of 35 ppt. This discrepancy is brought about by the volume of fresh water that empties <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bay</b> and its extensions, from Copano Creek, Mission River and Aransas River, forming the Mission-Aransas estuary. Fresh water flows also arrive from the impact of the Guadalupe River on San Antonio Bay. Combined, the fresh water influence is 60 to 70 percent of the system's volume, which is judged to be minimal.|$|E
50|$|Dumping sewage in to <b>the</b> <b>bays</b> of Sag Harbor {{was a major}} problem. As of today, sewage {{from the}} village of Sag Harbor is not just dumped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bays</b> anymore. <b>The</b> Department of Public Works, Wastewater Treatment Plant {{attempts}} to clean the water before it gets <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bays.</b> They have been able to reach this goal by “using chlorine to kill bacteria before entering the bay”. As of today the village is using an ultra-violet system which will kill the bacteria.|$|R

5|$|Major Himalayan-origin {{rivers that}} {{substantially}} flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, {{both of which}} drain <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> of Bengal. Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi; the latter's extremely low gradient often leads to severe floods and course changes. Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the Krishna, which also drain <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> of Bengal; and the Narmada and the Tapti, which drain into the Arabian Sea. Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh. India has two archipelagos: the Lakshadweep, coral atolls off India's south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea.|$|E
5|$|Several rivers, {{including}} the Parrett, Brue and Washford, drain <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bay.</b> Man-made drainage ditches from the Somerset Levels, {{including the}} River Huntspill, also run <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bay.</b> The mud flats provide a habitat {{for a wide}} range of flora and fauna. These include some nationally rare plants, beetles and snails. It is particularly important for over-wintering waders and wildfowl, with approximately 190 species recorded including whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa), dunlin (Calidris alpina) and wigeon (Anas penelope). Fishing has taken place using shallow boats, known as flatners, and fixed wooden structures for hundreds of years. It was also the last site in England used for 'mudhorse fishing'. There are several small harbours along the coast.|$|E
5|$|The southwestern {{corner of}} Gyeongju, {{on the far}} side of the Taebaek range, drains into the Geumho River, which then flows into the Nakdong.

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave in {{the western}} Caribbean organized into Tropical Depression Twenty on October 1. Off {{the coast of the}} Yucatán Peninsula, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Stan on October 2. Stan made landfall on the Yucatán and weakened to a tropical depression, but upon reemerging <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> of Campeche it quickly strengthened into a hurricane on October 4. Stan made landfall later that morning on the east-central coast of Mexico, south of Veracruz, as a Category1 hurricane.|$|E
5|$|As Tropical Depression Two emerged <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> of Campeche on June18, the Government of Mexico {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm watch for coastal areas between Punta El Lagarto and Barra Da Nautla. The watch was upgraded to {{a tropical storm}} warning early on June19. Following the storm's intensification that day, the warning was expanded northward to Tuxpan. Officials dispatched 34,250workers to set up refugee camps throughout the state. Across Veracruz, approximately 2,000people sought refuge in shelters.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Dean emerged <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> of Campeche as a Category1 {{hurricane}} on {{the afternoon}} of August21. Its inner core was largely disrupted, so although a ragged eye reformed over the warm waters of the bay, the hurricane no longer had the structure to support its previous strength. Nevertheless, the warm waters of the bay proved conducive for some development and the eye contracted overnight, indicating that the hurricane was regaining structure. With better structure came stronger winds of 100mph (160km/h), and the storm was re-categorized as a Category2 hurricane.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Dean {{was one of}} two {{storms in}} the 2007 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season to make landfall as a Category5 hurricane and was the seventh most intense Atlantic hurricane ever recorded, tied with Camille and Mitch. After its first landfall, Hurricane Dean crossed the Yucatán Peninsula and emerged, weakened, <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> of Campeche. It briefly restrengthened in the warm waters of the bay before making a second landfall in Veracruz. Dean progressed to the northwest, weakening into a remnant low which finally dissipated over the southwestern United States.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of these}} {{approximately}} 500 abandoned ships were used at times as storeships, saloons and hotels; many {{were left to}} rot and some were sunk to establish title to the underwater lot. By 1851 the harbor was extended out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bay</b> by wharves while buildings were erected on piles among the ships. By 1870 Yerba Buena Cove had been filled to create new land. Buried ships are occasionally exposed when foundations are dug for new buildings.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1914, {{the lower}} {{course of the}} Don River was altered to improve flood management, however the new course caused more {{pollution}} to flow <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bay</b> near the Ashbridges' land. In 1923, the bay was drained and filled to create industrial land, using fill dredged from the Toronto Harbour. The home which was once next to the shore was now located some distance away from the water.|$|E

At the same time, tidal water does not reach the interior of the coastal margin, limiting interchange between salt and freshwater ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|They {{returned}} to Botany Bay {{on the evening}} of 23 January, when Phillip gave orders to move the fleet to Sydney Cove the next morning, 24 January. That day, there was a huge gale blowing, making it impossible to leave Botany Bay, so they decided to wait till the next day, 25 January. However, during 24 January, they spotted the ships Astrolabe and Boussole, flying the French flag, at the entrance to Botany Bay; they were having as much trouble getting <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bay</b> as the First Fleet was having getting out.|$|E

Steaming south on 1 January 1866, the warship stopped at Santo Domingo, Port-au-Prince and Havana before {{returning}} to Washington, D.C., on the 28th. She remained there until 19 March when she proceeded down river and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bay,</b> reaching Hampton Roads on the 23d.

5|$|Throughout the season, the IMD {{monitored}} ten depressions, {{three of}} which became cyclonic storms. The strongest storm {{of the year was}} Super Cyclonic Storm Gay. Crossing the Malay Peninsula <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> of Bengal on November4, Gay {{became one of the most}} powerful systems on record in the basin, attaining an estimated pressure of 930mbar (hPa; 27.46inHg). Collectively, the storms were responsible for at least 1,785fatalities, 1,445 of which were due the disastrous flooding triggered by the July Cyclonic Storm, and more than $25million in damage.|$|E
5|$|Weakening as {{it crossed}} the peninsula, Dean emerged <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> of Campeche and re-strengthened {{before making a}} second {{landfall}} in Veracruz. Although the second landfall did not bring winds as intense as the first, it brought more rainfall and caused devastating landslides in the states of Veracruz and Tabasco.
