This report (Part 2) concerns the second of three phases of the {{evaluation of}} the TFA Pathway. The first report (Part 1) was designed to provide a summary of data gathered on the operation of the Pathway in its initial stages.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Clinical {{governance}} {{will require}} general practitioners (GPs) and practice nurses (PNs) to become competent in finding, appraising, and implementing research evidence [...] {{the skills of}} evidence-based health care (EBHC). AIM: To report the experiences of GPs and PNs in training in this area. METHOD: We held 30 in-depth, semi-structured interviews throughout North Thames region with three groups of informants: primary care practitioners recruited from the mailing lists of established EBHC courses; organizers and teachers on these courses; and <b>educational</b> <b>advisers</b> from Royal Colleges, universities, and postgraduate departments. Detailed qualitative analysis was undertaken to identify themes from each of these interview groups. RESULTS: At {{the time of the}} fieldwork for this study (late 1997), remarkably few GPs or PNs had attended any formal EBHC courses in our region. Perceived barriers to attendance on courses included inconsistency in marketing terminology, cultural issues (e. g. EBHC being perceived as one aspect of rapid and unwanted change in the workplace), lack of confidence in the subject matter (especially mathematics and statistics), lack of time, and practical and financial constraints. Our interviews suggested, however, that the principles and philosophy of EBHC are beginning to permeate traditional lecture-based continuing medical education courses, and consultant colleagues increasingly seek to make their advice 'evidence based'. CONCLUSION: We offer some preliminary recommendations for the organizers of EBHC courses for primary care. These include offering a range of flexible training, being explicit about course content, recognizing differences in professional culture between primary and secondary care and between doctors and nurses, and addressing issues of funding and accreditation at national level. Introducing EBHC through traditional topic-based postgraduate teaching programmes may be more acceptable and more effective than providing dedicated courses in its theoretical principles...|$|R

40|$|Aims in {{the last}} few years {{epidemiological}} studies in Brazil have detected significant increases in the use and abuse of psychoactive drugs by adolescents: however. there is it paucity of data on the factors associated with this use. Objectives To assess the prevalence of drug use by students from public schools in a Brazilian city and to evaluate the influence of age. school achievement, family, psychosocial, health, demographic and behavioural characteristics on regular drug use. Design This cross-sectional study was conducted using a representative sample of 6417 students attending public schools in the City of Barueri, Brazil and included adolescents from the 5 th grade of elementary school to the 3 rd year of high school. the Brazilian version of the Drug Use Screening Inventory (DUSI-R) was administered in the classroom by trained <b>educational</b> <b>advisers</b> without teachers being present. Findings prevalence rates for the previous month were: alcohol: 48 %, tobacco: 22. 5 %. cannabis: 14 %. inhalants/solvents: 5 %, cocaine: 3 %, tranquillizers: 0. 5 %. amphetamines: 0. 9 %, anabolic steroids: 0. 1 % and ecstasy: 0. 9 %. With the exceptions of tranquillizers and amphetamines, the older students reported significantly higher frequencies and amounts of drug use than the younger ones. Boys reported a significantly higher consumption of alcohol. cannabis, cocaine and ecstasy than girls, as well as higher percentages of frequent/heavy use. Logistic regression analysis detected that poor school achievement a poor or bad relationship with those with whom they live. studying in the evening period, presence of antisocial behaviour, family problems and friends who use drugs were factors significantly associated with drug use. Conclusions the findings suggest that preventive programmes should be more comprehensive in scope, rather than focusing only on information about the negative consequences of drug use.

40|$|International audienceMy paper {{draws on}} the first results of ongoing {{research}} {{in the context of}} French secondary education (colleges, high schools) of three academies (Paris, Nancy-Metz, Lille). My objective was to study current changes in the field of Information and Media Education (IME) in today’s digital world. I assessed {{the degree to which the}} info-documentary dimension has been progressively introduced into the curricula of traditional disciplines and whether this resulted in curricular recompositions. Specifically, I wanted to identify the scope and the contents of this education with the aim to understand whether or not it could build an info-documentary look that might provide an interpretative framework for understanding the world. I will present the French research context as a first step. Regarded as a necessity today, information and media education is an unified concept marked by a shift from a singular to a pluralist conception of information culture “in the new age”. As a field of practice, information-documentation has not been regarded as a discipline. But recent official documents, introduced “interdisciplinary practical teachings”, focusing on digital learning and linking information-communication and citizenship. A clear reference was made to information and communication sciences and to the sociology of culture and media. And the role of teacher-librarian was more prominent as he or she was described as the person in charge of supervising the acquisition by all students of “an information and media culture”. However, without dedicated teaching, information-documentation was addressed only on a pragmatic and operative mode and the responsibility of the different actors remained unclear. Far from opposing ‘education’ and ‘teaching’, I studied these areas of uncertainty. In particular I questioned how the actors seized the institutional guidelines. I was concerned with who did what. To arrive at answers to these and other questions, I administered a questionnaire survey of 17 open and closed questions, to all actors in education (e. g., teachers, teacher-librarians, principal <b>educational</b> <b>advisers,</b> school leaders) via academic mailing lists. In this first research phase the questionnaires helped me attempt to identify trends concerning the integration of IME, including perceived importance, aims and issues, modalities of inclusion, supporting devices, collaborations and partnerships, contents such as knowledge and progression, barriers, and levers to its implementation. This phase helped me prepare for the second stage, more qualitative, stage of data collection. In the second stage I aimed at deepening the understanding of the practices declared by the actors through interviews and observations in a few selected schools. Several elements emerged that highlighted a strong disciplinary mark that can be an obstacle to an open and pluralistic approach of EIM. Key among these results is evidence that information-documentation is rarely thought as an epistemological unit in its continuity and its coherence...|$|R
