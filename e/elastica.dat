40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} age related {{changes of the}} elastic fiber system in the interfoveolar ligament, we studied the deep inguinal ring from 33 male cadavers aged from stillborn to 76 years. Selective and alternated staining methods for elastic fibers were performed to differentiate oxytalan, elaunin, and mature elastic fibers. We confirmed quantitative changes of the elastic fiber system with aging. There was a significant and progressive reduction of the oxytalan fibers (responsible for tissue resistance) and a significant increment in the mature elastic and elaunin fibers (responsible for tissue elasticity). Furthermore, there were structural changes in the thickness, shortness and curling of these mature elastic fibers. These changes induced loss of the elastic fiber function and loss of the interfoveolar ligament compliance. These factors predispose individuals {{to the development of}} indirect inguinal hernias that frequently emerge in adults and aged individuals, especially above the fifth decade. Com o objetivo de avaliar as alterações do sistema de fibras <b>elásticas</b> relacionadas ao envelhecimento do ligamento interfoveolar estudou-se o anel inguinal profundo em 33 cadáveres do sexo masculino com idade variando de recém-nascido a 76 anos. Métodos de coloração seletiva para as fibras <b>elásticas</b> foram empregados para diferenciar fibras oxitalânicas, fibras elaunínicas e fibras <b>elásticas</b> maduras. Verificaram-se alterações quantitativas significantes no sistema de fibras <b>elásticas</b> do ligamento interfoveolar com o envelhecimento: uma redução progressiva de fibras oxitalânicas, responsáveis pela resistência do tecido conjuntivo, e um aumento de fibras <b>elásticas</b> maduras e elaunínicas, responsáveis pela elasticidade tecidual. Demonstraram-se alterações estruturais, como espessamento, encurtamento e encurvamento das fibras <b>elásticas</b> maduras e elaunínicas. Estas alterações induzem a perda de função das fibras <b>elásticas,</b> o que certamente levará a perda de complacência do ligamento interfoveolar, predispondo à hérnia inguinal indireta, que freqüentemente aparece em homens adultos ou idosos, especialmente acima de 50 anos de idade...|$|R

40|$|OBJETIVO: Investigar os efeitos da desnutrição proteica materna durante a lactação sobre as fibras <b>elásticas</b> da traqueia de filhotes de ratos Wistar. MÉTODOS: Ao nascimento, 12 filhotes machos de duas ratas Wistar foram igualmente divididos em dois grupos: grupo controle, cuja mãe recebeu água e dieta padrão de laboratório {{ad libitum}} durante a lactação, e grupo restrição proteica (RP), cuja mãe recebeu água ad libitum e dieta isoenergética com RP (8 % de proteína). Aos 21 dias de vida, os filhotes foram sacrificados, e suas traqueias foram ressecadas. As fibras <b>elásticas</b> foram coradas pelo método de resorcina-fucsina de Weigert (precedido de oxidação) e avaliadas sob microscopia óptica. As determinações morfométricas foram feitas por estereologia, utilizando o método de contagem de pontos, e expressas em densidade volumétrica. RESULTADOS: As fibras <b>elásticas</b> foram identificadas abaixo da mucosa traqueal, sendo a maioria em distribuição longitudinal. Além disso, camadas circulares bem definidas de fibras <b>elásticas</b> envolviam as superfícies interna e externa do anel cartilaginoso. Não houve diferenças entre os grupos quanto à organização e distribuição das fibras <b>elásticas.</b> A densidade volumétrica das fibras <b>elásticas</b> dos filhotes nos grupos controle e RP foi de, respectivamente, 2, 46 ± 0, 99 % e 3, 25 ± 1, 13 % (p OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} maternal protein malnutrition during lactation on the elastic fibers in the tracheas of Wistar rat pups. METHODS: At delivery, 12 male pups of two Wistar rat dams were equally divided into two groups: control, in which the dam received water and standard rat chow ad libitum during lactation; and protein-restricted (PR), in which the dam received water ad libitum and an isoenergetic PR diet (8 % protein). At 21 days of age, the pups were killed and their tracheas were excised. The elastic fibers were stained with Weigert's resorcin-fuchsin (after oxidation) and evaluated under light microscopy. Morphometric determinations were performed by stereology, with the point-counting method, and expressed as volumetric densities. RESULTS: Elastic fibers, most having a longitudinal distribution, were identified beneath the tracheal mucosa. In addition, well-defined circular layers of elastic fibers were found around {{the inner and outer}} surfaces of the cartilaginous ring. There were no differences between the groups regarding the organization and distribution of the elastic fibers. The volumetric density of the elastic fibers of the pups in the control and PR groups was 2. 46 ± 0. 99 % and 3. 25 ± 1. 13 %, respectively (p < 0. 01).

40|$|PURPOSE: Our {{previous}} studies demonstrated structural and quantitative age-related {{changes of the}} elastic fibers in transversalis fascia, which {{may play a role}} in inguinal hernia formation. To verify whether there were differences in the extracellular matrix between direct and indirect inguinal hernia, we studied the amount of collagen and elastic fibers in the transversalis fascia of 36 male patients with indirect inguinal hernia and 21 with direct inguinal hernia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Transversalis fascia fragments were obtained during surgical intervention and underwent histological quantitative analysis of collagen by colorimetry and analysis of elastic fibers by histomorphometry. RESULTS: We demonstrated significantly lower amounts of collagen and higher amounts of elastic fibers in transversalis fascia from patients with direct inguinal hernia compared to indirect inguinal hernia patients. The transversalis fascia from direct inguinal hernia patients showed structural changes of the mature and elaunin elastic fibers, which are responsible for elasticity, and lower density of oxytalan elastic fibers, which are responsible for resistance. These changes promoted loss of resiliency of the transversalis fascia. CONCLUSION: These results improve our understanding of the participation of the extracellular matrix in the genesis of direct inguinal hernia, suggesting a relationship with genetic defects of the elastic fiber and collagen synthesis.

25|$|Britpop {{emerged from}} the British indie scene of the early 1990s and was characterised by bands {{influenced}} by British guitar pop music of the 1960s and 1970s. The movement developed as a reaction against various musical and cultural trends in the late 1980s and early 1990s, particularly the grunge phenomenon from the United States. New British groups such as Suede and Blur launched the movement by positioning themselves as opposing musical forces, referencing British guitar music {{of the past and}} writing about uniquely British topics and concerns. These bands were soon joined by others including Oasis, Pulp, Supergrass and <b>Elastica.</b> Britpop groups brought British indie rock into the mainstream and formed the backbone of a larger British cultural movement called Cool Britannia. Although its more popular bands were able to spread their commercial success overseas, especially to the United States, the movement largely fell apart {{by the end of the}} decade.|$|E
25|$|Though Britpop is seen {{retrospectively}} as {{a marketing}} tool, {{and more of a}} cultural moment than a musical style or genre, there are musical conventions and influences the bands grouped under the Britpop term have in common. Britpop bands show elements from the British pop music of the Sixties, glam rock and punk rock of the Seventies, and indie pop of the Eighties in their music, attitude, and clothing. Specific influences vary: Blur and Oasis drew from the Kinks and the Beatles, respectively, while <b>Elastica</b> had a fondness for arty punk rock. Regardless, Britpop artists project a sense of reverence for British pop sounds of the past. Alternative rock acts from the indie scene of the Eighties and early Nineties were the direct ancestors of the Britpop movement. The influence of the Smiths is common to the majority of Britpop artists. The Madchester scene, fronted by the Stone Roses, Happy Mondays and Inspiral Carpets (for whom Oasis's Noel Gallagher had worked as a roadie during the Madchester years), was an immediate root of Britpop since its emphasis on good times and catchy songs provided an alternative to the British-based shoegazing and American based grunge styles of music.|$|E

It turns out that the set of stable equilibrium points coincides with the set of minima of U, so that the corresponding shapes of the curves obtained may be regarded as normal forms of Euler <b>elasticae.</b> In this way, we find the solution of the Euler problem (set in 1744) for plane closed <b>elasticae.</b> As a by-product, we obtain a "mechanical" proof of the Whitney [...] Graustein theorem on the classification of regular curves in the plane up to regular homotopy (in the particular case of C^ 2 curves).

40|$|A {{literatura}} relata que ligamentos consistem de tecido conjuntivo denso, composto por água, colágeno tipos I e III, diversas proteoglicanas, pouca elastina e várias outras substâncias. Além disso, os ligamentos, quando testados {{in vitro}} com tensão longitudinal e unidirecional, apresentam um comportamento mecânico não-linear, ou seja, as fibras colágenas são alongadas aos poucos, perdendo seu padrão ondulado, até que todas estejam no limite máximo de tração e iniciem o rompimento. Portanto, no presente estudo avaliou-se a presença de fibras <b>elásticas</b> (elastina) no ligamento colateral medial do cotovelo de cães adultos para ponderar se a elasticidade do referido ligamento deve-se à presença de fibras <b>elásticas</b> ou às propriedades <b>elásticas</b> do colágeno ou à combinação de ambas. Foram utilizadas quatro articulações, de machos e fêmeas em igual proporção, das quais foram adquiridas as amostras das porções médias dos ligamentos colaterais mediais para a rotina histológica. Os cortes foram corados pela técnica de Weigert, e não foi observada a presença de fibras <b>elásticas,</b> detectável por esta técnica à microscopia de luz. Concluiu-se que a elasticidade do ligamento colateral medial do cotovelo de cão deve-se, principalmente, ao padrão ondulado das fibras colágenas, devido à quantidade ínfima ou até à inexistência de fibras <b>elásticas</b> nesta estrutura. The literature reports that ligaments consist of connective tissue, composed by water, Type I and III collagen, several proteoglycans, some elastin and other substances. Ligaments tested in vitro with longitudinal and unidirectional tension exhibit non-linear mechanical behavior; the collagen fibers are stretched little by little, losing their undulating pattern, until reaching the maximum limit of traction and failure begins. The {{aim of the}} present study was to assess the presence of elastin in the medial collateral ligament of the elbow in adult dogs to determine whether the stretching of this ligament is due to the presence of elastic fibers, the elastic property of the collagen or the combination of both. Four joints were used from males and females in equal proportion, taking the medial collateral ligaments for the histological examination. To detect the presence of elastic fibers, sections were stained using the Weigert method. However, light microscopy revealed no elastic fibers. It was concluded that the elasticity of the canine elbow medial collateral ligament is mainly due to the undulated pattern of the collagen fibers, considering the trace amount or inexistence of elastic fibers in this structure...|$|R
