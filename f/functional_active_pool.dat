We report the first direct observation, by X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy, of the Mn sites in chloroplasts isolated from Spinacia oleracea. The manganese in chlorplasts is commonly thought to exist in two pools. The major pool, corresponding to two-thirds of the manganese, can be reversibly released with concomitant loss of oxygen evolving capacity, and has thus come to be assigned as the <b>active</b> <b>pool.</b> The role of the remanant one-third, or tightly bound pool is moot. Our analysis of the Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure of the <b>active</b> <b>pool</b> {{is consistent with a}} bridged dimeric structure involving two manganese atoms separated by about 2. 7 {Angstroms}. The distance between manganese and bridging ligands is about 1. 8 {Angstrom}.

In all raffles, {{one half of the}} proceeds are donated to a local charity and the raffle winner wins the other half. The mechanisms differ by what happens to the tickets purchased in the first stage. In the complete draw down two-stage raffle, the first stage tickets are eliminated from the <b>active</b> <b>pool</b> of tickets, while in the no draw down raffle they remain in the <b>active</b> <b>pool.</b> We find that both two-stage raffles initially perform better than the standard one-stage 50 – 50 raffle. Over time, the aggregate contribution level in the complete draw down raffle declines and approaches that of the one-stage raffle, while in the no draw down raffle contributions are stable and remain higher than those in the other two mechanisms. In both two-stage raffles, we observe a positive correlation between the proceeds of the first stage and the number of tickets bought in the second stage. Our results are at odds with a standard warm glow model of giving, and also cannot be explained by the joy of winning or learning about bidders' types...|$|R

Lag {{times in the}} equilibration of exogenously given and intracellularly present uracil before linear labeling of catabolic and anabolic products was determined to estimate {{the size of its}} metabolically <b>active</b> <b>pool.</b> This pool operates in the incorporation and degradation of uracil.

The amount of the metabolically <b>active</b> uracil <b>pool,</b> estimated as 11 pmol/ 10 (7) heterotrophically growing cells, decreased to almost zero during light-induced RNA synthesis and could be changed by preloading with uracil or thymine.

This is metabolically inert, but may be mobilized by nitrogen-carbon starvation. The role of uracil compartmentation in this metabolically flexible organism is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Labile soil organic {{phosphorus}} (Po) plays {{a crucial}} role in plant P nutrition and in environmental eutrophication. This paper discusses recent studies on the nature of labile soil Po and its response to different fertilization practices. Soil material was obtained from the Askov long-term experiment on animal manure and mineral fertilizers. Our analytical approach combined a macroporous anion exchange resin to isolate labile Po and 31 P NMR spectroscopy to assess the chemical composition and origin of NaOH-extractable Po. The analyses were carried out on fine earth (< 2 mm) and particle-size fractions. The results suggest that the resin extraction isolates an <b>active</b> <b>pool</b> of soil Po that consists primarily of microbially-derived compounds. The size of the <b>active</b> Po <b>pool</b> reflects seasonal variations and P fertilization. However, the source of added P (NPK vs. animal manure) appears to have only little influence on the labile Po. Our results further suggest that most of the active soil Po is associated with clay sized separates (< 2 μm), indicating this fraction being important in the short-term turnover of Po...|$|R

40|$|The Tetrahymena group I intron splices 20 to 50 {{times faster}} in Tetrahymena than in vitro, {{implying}} that the intron rapidly adopts its active conformation in the cell. The importance of cotranscriptional folding and {{the contribution of the}} rRNA exons to the stability of the active pre-RNA structure were investigated by comparing the activity of minimal pre-RNAs expressed in Escherichia coli. Pre-RNAs containing exons derived from E. coli 23 S rRNA were three to four times more active than the wild-type Tetrahymena pre-RNA. E. coli transcripts of the chimeric E. coli pre-RNA were two to eight times more active than were T 7 transcripts. However, the effect of cotranscriptional folding depends on exon sequences. Unexpectedly, the unspliced pre-RNA decays more slowly than predicted from the rate of splicing. This observation is best explained by partitioning of transcripts into <b>active</b> and inactive <b>pools.</b> We propose that the <b>active</b> <b>pool</b> splices within a few seconds, whereas the inactive pool is degraded without appreciable splicing...|$|R

40|$|We have {{explored}} {{the dynamics of}} intermediate filament assembly and subunit exchange using fluorescently labeled neurofilament proteins and a fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay. Neurofilaments (NFs) are assembled from three highly phosphorylated proteins with molecular masses of 180 (NF-H), 130 (NF-M), and 66 kD (NF-L) of which NF-L forms the structural core. The core component, NF-L, was stoichiometrically labeled at cysteine 321 with fluorescein, coumarin, or biotin-maleimide to produce assembly-competent fluorescent or biotinylated derivatives, respectively. Using coumarin-labeled NF-L as fluorescence donor and fluorescein-labeled NF-L as the fluorescence acceptor, assembly of NF filaments was induced by rapidly raising the NaCl concentration to 170 mM, and the kinetics {{was followed by the}} decrease in the donor fluorescence. Assembly of NF-L subunits into filaments does not require nucleotide binding or hydrolysis but is strongly dependent on ionic strength, pH, and temperature. The critical concentration of NF-L, that concentration that remains unassembled at equilibrium with fully formed filaments, is 38 micrograms/ml or 0. 6 microM. Under physiological salt conditions NF-L filaments also undergo extensive subunit exchange. Kinetic analysis and evaluation of several possible mechanisms indicate that subunit exchange is preceded by dissociation of subunits from the filament and generation of a kinetically <b>active</b> <b>pool</b> of soluble subunits. Given the concentration of NF-L found in nerve cells and the possibility of regulating this pool, these results provide the first information that intermediate filaments are dynamic structures and that NF-L within the NF complex is in dynamic equilibrium with a small but kinetically <b>active</b> <b>pool</b> of unassembled NF-L units...|$|R
