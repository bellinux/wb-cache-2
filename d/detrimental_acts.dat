40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{experiences}} of six individuals who identified themselves as victims of spiritual abuse. The academic community has {{an awareness of the}} more spectacular ‘cults’ that have imploded in recent years, however the more grey, less well defined phenomenon of ‘spiritual abuse’ is under-researched. This study acknowledges and builds on previous research completed on religious cults. In this regard, that body of knowledge has been most valuable in its exploration of a multitude of mental health and social-psychological variables. However, there is a noticeable gap when material is sought that explores the internal, meaning-making experience. This qualitative research aims to narrow that gap. Six participants via a snowball sampling volunteered for the study. Two participants were married and came from the same group. The other respondents exited different groups, leaving a total of six participants who have left five different religious groups that were essentially Judeo-Christian in their orientation. As the study aimed to examine human experience, a qualitative methodology with a phenomenological core was chosen. A hermeneutical, or interpretivist approach was taken, thereby freely using current literature to help make sense of the participants’ narratives. In keeping with this methodology, in-depth, unstructured interviews were used, and transcripts coded for significant themes. Parallel themes were noted in all six respondent transcripts, which were then compared and contrasted with each other. The themes included Leadership representing God (powerful symbolic authority), Spiritual bullying (manipulative behaviour), Acceptance via performance (approval through obedience), Spiritual neglect (<b>detrimental</b> <b>acts</b> of omission), Expanding external/internal tension (dissonance between one’s inner and outer worlds) and Manifestation of internal states (the somatic and psychological repercussions of the abuse). Each of these themes were interrelated and the experience affected the bio/psycho/social/spiritual domains of the individual’s life. The study revealed that spiritual abuse is a multifaceted and multilayered phenomenon that can affect an individual and the immediate family deeply. The strength of the research is demonstrated by the depth of experience that surfaced. The rich spiritual journey of the participants was evident in the study and offers a compelling representation of the lived experience of spiritual abuse. These emerging themes were also examined via the wider literature to provide further elucidation of the experience of spiritual abuse. Subsequently, it is argued that the research is a valuable contribution to understanding other phenomena in the social and behavioural sciences. Secondly, elements of spiritual abuse were also located in a range of other social and behavioural realities. The study also highlighted areas for future research. This includes other relationallybased domains where mistreatment is possible, the interface between psychology and spiritual belief, and how the notion of God is internalised during one’s spiritual journey across the lifecycle. Finally, the insights from this study are offered as a foundation from which to help therapists and counsellors be more informed about the phenomenon as well as to develop a deeper appreciation for the subjective experience...|$|E

They assert that, since there were no dogmatic proclamations defined within the documents of the council, such documents are not infallible and therefore not canonically binding for faithful Roman Catholics, most notably when such concilliar documents give way, as they say, to loose implementation of longstanding upheld Catholic doctrine previously sanctioned by former Popes prior to 1962. In light of this, most Traditionalist Catholics often exclusively adhere to the 1917 Code of Canon Law.|$|R
40|$|Aging {{is always}} present, {{tailoring}} our interactions {{with others and}} postulating a finite lifespan during which {{we are able to}} exercise them. We consider the prisoner's dilemma game on a square lattice, and examine how quenched age distributions and different aging protocols influence the evolution of cooperation when taking the life experience and knowledge accumulation into account as time passes. In agreement with previous studies, we find that a quenched assignment of age to players, introducing heterogeneity to the game, substantially promotes cooperative behavior. Introduction of aging and subsequent death as a coevolutionary process may <b>act</b> <b>detrimental</b> on cooperation but enhances it efficiently if the offspring of individuals that have successfully passed their strategy is considered newborn. We study resulting age distributions of players, and show that the heterogeneity is vital yet insufficient for explaining the observed differences in cooperator abundance on the spatial grid. The unexpected increment of cooperation levels can be explained by a dynamical effect that has a highly selective impact on the propagation of cooperator and defector states.

First {{the historical development of}} these crimes is described, both from the view of legislation and criminology. Further, the sources of the legislative regulation of these crimes are defined. Since fraud belongs in the category of property crimes, these are also discussed collectivelly, with emphasis on the individual common elements of the above-mentioned crimes. The above-mentioned crimes are each individually described with respect to their individual elements including the description of eventual problematic elements of the current legislation. In case of the special elements of these crimes the legislation regarding the respective contractual obligations is described.

5000|$|A scandal can be {{broadly defined}} as an {{accusation}} or accusations that receive wide exposure. Generally there is {{a negative effect on}} the credibility of the person or organisation involved. Society is scandalised when it is made aware of blatant breaches of moral norms or legal requirements. In contemporary times, exposure is often made by mass media. Such breaches have typically erupted from greed, lust or the abuse of power. Scandals may be regarded as political, sexual, moral, literary or artistic but often spread from one realm into another. The basis of a scandal may be factual or false, or a combination of both. [...] Contemporary media has the capacity to spread knowledge of a scandal further than in previous centuries and public interest has encouraged many cases of confected scandals relating to well-known people as well as genuine scandals relating to politics and business. Some scandals are revealed by whistleblowers who discover wrongdoing within organizations or groups, such as Deep Throat (William Mark Felt) during the Watergate scandal in the 1970s in the United States. Whistleblowers may be protected by laws which are used to obtain information of misdeeds and <b>acts</b> <b>detrimental</b> to their establishments. However, the possibility of scandal has always created a tension between society's efforts to reveal wrongdoing and its desire to cover them up.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} cyclic competition on pattern formation in the rock-paper-scissors game. By separately considering random and prepared initial conditions, we observe a critical influence of the competition rate $p$ on the stability of spiral waves and on the emergence of biodiversity. In particular, while increasing values of $p$ promote biodiversity, they may <b>act</b> <b>detrimental</b> on spatial pattern formation. For random initial conditions, we observe a phase transition from biodiversity to an absorbing phase, whereby the critical value of mobility grows linearly with increasing values of $p$ on a log-log scale, but then saturates as $p$ becomes large. For prepared initial conditions, we observe the formation of single-armed spirals, but only for values of $p$ that are below a critical value. Once above, the spirals break up and form disordered spatial structures, {{mainly because of the}} percolation of vacant sites. Thus, there exists a critical value of the competition rate $p_{c}$ for stable single-armed spirals in finite populations. Importantly though, $p_{c}$ increases with increasing system size, because noise reinforces the disintegration of ordered patterns. In addition, we also find that $p_{c}$ increases with the mobility. These phenomena are reproduced by a deterministic model that is based on nonlinear partial differential equations. Our findings indicate that competition is vital for the sustenance of biodiversity and emergence of pattern formation in ecosystems governed by cyclical interactions.

40|$|Premature {{failure of}} the {{impeller}} blade of coke plant has been investigated. The component functioned during the CGC gas intake cycle. The component rotates at 1480  rpm with a volumetric flow of 720  m 3 /min of flue gas with temperature about 200 – 300  °C. The failed component reveals exposed surface of a crack that extended slightly beyond the assembly weld. From macro-structural observation under-filled region in welding is observed which is <b>detrimental</b> because it <b>acts</b> as a stress concentration site. The microstructure from the weld zone showed severe intergranular corrosion degradation. Micro cracks and cracks have been observed at several locations, mostly originating from the weld zone. From the EDS analysis of the failed sample {{it is observed that}} there is a deposition of Cr along the grain boundary. From the mode of failure it indicates that probable reason for the premature failure is due to sensitization of the component. In this case, the precipitation of chromium carbides may be occurred during welding operation when the heat affected zone (HAZ) experiences a particular temperature range (550 – 850  °C). From the microstructure it is observed that the welding operation was not proper and there is every chance that there is heat generation in around sensitization range leading to precipitation of chromium carbides consumed the alloying element – chromium from a narrow band along the grain boundary and this makes the zone anodic to the unaffected grains. The chromium depleted zone becomes the preferential path for corrosion attack or crack propagation if under tensile stress. Thus it leads to premature {{failure of the}} component during service...|$|R
40|$|Economic {{experiments}} {{have shown that}} punishment can increase public goods game contributions over time. However, the effectiveness of punishment is challenged by second-order freeriding and antisocial punishment. The latter implies that non-cooperators punish cooperators, while the former implies unwillingness to shoulder the cost of punishment. Here we extend the theory of cooperation in the spatial public goods game by considering four competing strategies, which are traditional cooperators and defectors, as well as cooperators who punish defectors and defectors who punish cooperators. We show that if the synergistic effects are high enough to sustain cooperation based on network reciprocity alone, antisocial punishment does not deter public cooperation. Conversely, if synergistic effects are low and punishment is actively needed to sustain cooperation, antisocial punishment does <b>act</b> <b>detrimental,</b> {{but only if the}} cost-to-fine ratio is low. If the costs are relatively high, cooperation again dominates as a result of spatial pattern formation. Counterintuitively, defectors who do not punish cooperators, and are thus effectively second-order freeriding on antisocial punishment, form an active layer around punishing cooperators, which protects them against defectors that punish cooperators. A stable three-strategy phase that is sustained by the spontaneous emergence of cyclic dominance is also possible via the same route. The microscopic mechanism behind the reported evolutionary outcomes {{can be explained by the}} comparison of invasion rates that determine the stability of subsystem solutions. Our results reveal an unlikely evolutionary escape from adverse effects of antisocial punishment, and they provide a rationale for why second-order freeriding is not always an impediment to the evolutionary stability of punishment.

40|$|Psychosocial {{circumstances}} {{during early}} life are increasingly recognized as crucial, {{not only for}} the growing individual but also for health throughout life. A possible mechanism could be physiologic dysregulation due to stress. Cortisol in hair is a new biomarker that allows assessment of long-term activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The objective of this thesis was to investigate the relationship between early stress, levels of cortisol in hair and health among children in different psycho-social environments. The ABIS-study is a prospective population-based cohort study of every child born in southeast Sweden between Oct 1 1997 and Oct 1 1999 (N= 21, 700) in which approximately 17, 000 families (79 %) participated. The studies presented in Papers I, III and IV were based on ABIS data on children aged 1, 3, 5 and 8 years concerning stress related psychosocial variables as well as hair samples and diabetes related autoantibodies. Papers I and IV compared a subsample (n= 2, 448) from two different social environments. Paper III consisted of a subsample of 100 children as well as their mothers. Paper II covered 99 university students. Paper I showed that the risk for diabetes-related autoantibodies, both against GADA and IAG 2 A (> 95 % cut off), was significantly higher (p< 0. 0001) among children from the blue-collar than from the white-collar city. This difference persisted still after adjustment for other previously documented risk factors. In paper II the method of measuring cortisol concentrations in hair was developed and mean cortisol levels were significantly related to serious life events (p= 0. 045) among the students. Paper III demonstrated that, in children from one to eight years of age, cortisol levels in hair decreased over time and correlated to each succeeding age, between years 1 and 3 (r= 0. 30,p= 0. 002), 3 and 5 (r= 0. 39, p= 0. 001), and 5 and 8 (r= 0. 44, p= 0. 001). Repeated measures gave a significant linear association over time (p= 0. 001). Maternal hair cortisol levels during the second and third trimester and child hair cortisol at year 1 and 3 was also significantly associated. Paper IV showed that children with prenatal psychosocial exposures had higher infant cortisol levels in hair (B= 0. 40, p< 0. 0001, adjusted for gender and size for gestational age) in a dose-response manner and were more often (p≤ 0. 05) affected by 12 of the 14 most common childhood diagnoses with a general pattern of rising ORs. In conclusion, the findings in this thesis showed that children born into an environment fraught with adverse psychosocial exposures seem to have an increased hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity. It appears to be persistent throughout early childhood and affect health negatively, as evidenced through common childhood diseases and levels of autoantibodies. A widespread and dose response-like effect of adverse psychosocial circumstances was seen on the different outcomes studied throughout this thesis. This supports the model of physiologic dysregulation as a plausible pathway in how the duration and number of early <b>detrimental</b> exposures <b>act</b> as a trajectory to health disparities. Knowledge of these relationships could be valuable in selecting preventive measures, not least in primary care. Moreover, given the prolonged nature of exposure to a stressful social environment, the novel biomarker of cortisol in hair appears to be a useful aid in studies on how long-term stress affects health and may be particularly relevant when applied to research on children...|$|R
40|$|The present {{overview}} of judicial {{decisions in the}} Netherlands concerning the current European Insolvency Regulation (EIR) (No. 1346 / 2000) during the 13 years of its applicability indicates that jurisdiction has been the dominant issue in the Dutch Courts. Emphasizing the (relative) autonomy of a separate legal entity and referring to the more specific criteria of being ascertainable by third parties - as formulated by the Court of Justice in e. g. the Eurofood case - the Dutch Courts have fairly strictly presumed that {{the place of a}} company’s registered office determines the Centre of its Main Interests (COMI). With regard to determining jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings against natural persons who are still involved, in any way, in economic activities in the Netherlands, the Supreme Court of the Netherlands has ruled in a leading case that the place of the business interests prevails over a ‘habitual residence’ abroad, certainly if the latter is not absolutely clear. In the case of Seagon/Deko the Court of Justice clarified jurisdiction concerning insolvency-related issues and in the period before this preliminary decision the Dutch Courts could derive their jurisdiction from a provision of national procedural law. The few Court decisions on the applicable law in cross-border insolvency cases were particularly focussed on the voidness, voidability or unenforceability of legal <b>acts</b> <b>detrimental</b> to all the creditors and the derogation of the lex concursus by the lex causae (Art. 4 sub. 2 m and Art. 13 EIR) {{as well as on the}} effects of insolvency proceedings on a pending lawsuit (Art. 15 EIR). The question is whether the upcoming Recast of the European Insolvency Regulation (No. 2015 / 848) will require a change in Dutch judicial practice. The Recast puts strong emphasis on reorganisation proceedings. Where the wording of the scope of the Recast is somewhat diffuse, the exhaustive list of proceedings covered by the Recast (listed in Annex A) will become a relevant indication of the scope. The Dutch insolvency proceedings to be governed by the Recast are the same as those covered by the current Insolvency Regulation. According to the wording in the Recitals, the basis for jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings against companies and legal persons appears to be more ambiguous than in the current Insolvency Regulation. However, like the current Insolvency Regulation, the relevant article in the Recast presumes that the ‘registered office’ is the basis for presuming jurisdiction with regard to legal persons. This would seem to offer sufficient room for interpretation to continue the ‘third party’ approach often adopted in Dutch judicial practice, with its emphasis on a reference for the determination of a debtor’s COMI that is objectively ascertainable by third parties...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAnalyzing {{the place}} of {{negotiation}} in international insolvency may seem surprising. Many observers would challenge the fact that negotiation may have a place at all considering the force of public policy in the rationality of bankruptcy. However, negotiation has enjoyed a remarkable growth in this field as it attempts to reconcile security and freedom. The {{purpose of this study}} is to reveal the current trends of negotiation in international insolvency but also to formulate some thoughts on what we may expect in the future. In this perspective, the study excludes the specific phenomenon of sovereign debt restructuring. Conversely, it focuses on situations covered by the (EC) Regulation N° 1346 / 2000 on insolvency proceedings and the UNCITRAL Model Law on cross-border insolvency. Negotiation presents a dual advantage in the elaboration of the solutions of international insolvency : creditors and main partners of the debtor are involved in the success of the proceeding and negotiation allows the implementation of more acceptable solutions. However, individual negotiation conducted with a creditor or a partner has its limitations and dangers. Such negotiation violates the collective discipline of insolvency proceedings and can hardly achieve a global settlement of the difficulties of the debtor. Similarly, it may lead to <b>acts</b> <b>detrimental</b> to the interests of the proceeding. Thus, without being totally excluded, individual negotiation is discouraged. Conversely, while the financing techniques of international trade increase discrimination between creditors and the difficulties to be addressed in insolvency proceedings are increasingly heterogeneous, collective negotiation becomes a strategic tool - through the practice of pre-packin' - and an adaptation technique in order to achieve the recovery of the insolvens and maximize the value of its assets. However international insolvency is essentially a risk normalization method that economic operators want to determine according to their specific needs. Doctrine envisages this choice to be made initially, a priori. But this possibility remains highly theoretical. Conversely, international insolvency regime is determined by the lex fori concursus in practice and depends therefore on the competent authority. Thus, the criterion of center of main interests (COMI) to determine jurisdiction and, indirectly, the law applicable to the insolvency proceeding opens the possibility of a choice made by the transfer of COMI. Negotiation becomes a way of reconciling the collective interests protected by the insolvency proceeding with this aspiration to a free choice of international insolvency regime. Eventually, assuming a plurality of proceedings, negotiation between the authorities of bankruptcy reduces conflicts between systems and coordinate efforts for the construction of a solution. The insolvency protocol negotiated in the Lehman Brothers case is an illustration. The scope of insolvency protocols are varied : the exchange of information, the coordination of the effects of bankruptcy, the organization of a sole administration / jurisdiction governing the respective case unless considerations of comity otherwise require. Therefore, negotiation allows international insolvency proceedings to achieve their goals in a post-modern world. La faillite internationale ne paraît pas a priori propice à la négociation. Pourtant, la négociation connaît un essor remarquable dans cette matière. Alors que les techniques de financement du commerce international multiplient les discrimi- nations entre créanciers et que les difficultés à traiter dans le cadre de la procédure sont de plus en plus hétéroclites, la négociation constitue un outil d'adaptation des solutions en vue du redressement de l'entreprise et de la maximisation de sa valeur. Mais la faillite internationale est avant tout une méthode de normalisation du risque que les opérateurs économiques souhaitent pouvoir déterminer en fonction de leurs besoins. La négociation devient alors le moyen de concilier les intérêts collectifs protégés par la procédure avec cette aspiration à un libre choix du régime de l'insol- vabilité internationale. Enfin, dans l'hypothèse d'une pluralité de procédures, la négociation permet de réduire les oppositions entre systèmes et de coordonner les efforts déployés en vue de la construction de la solution...|$|R
