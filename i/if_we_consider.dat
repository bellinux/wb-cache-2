25|$|His first {{consideration}} {{is that the}} existence of God has to be demonstrated philosophically, besides the theological reasons for belief, particularly <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>consider</b> to make a demonstration for the non-believers. Moreover, the believers could be accused of making a circular reasoning, when saying that we must believe in God because of the Scriptures, and in the authority of the Scriptures because they have been inspired by God. He further indicates how the very Scriptures say that the mind of man is sufficient to discover God.|$|E
25|$|The random {{disorder}} in the potential {{landscape of the}} two-dimensional electron gas {{plays a key role}} in the observation of topological sectors and their instantons (phase transitions). Because of the disorder, the electrons are localized and thus they cannot flow across the sample. But <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>consider</b> a loop around a localized 2D electron, we can notice that current is still able to flow in the direction around this loop. This current is able to renormalize to larger scales and eventually becomes the Hall current that rotates along the edge of the sample. A topological sector corresponds to an integer number of rotations and it is now visible macroscopically, in the robustly quantized behavior of the measurable Hall current. If the electrons were not sufficiently localized, this measurement would be blurred out by the usual flow of current through the sample.|$|E
25|$|A serious {{difficulty}} arises if the variables are not {{measured in the}} same units. First consider measuring distance between a data point and the curve – what are the measurement units for this distance? <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>consider</b> measuring distance based on Pythagoras' Theorem then {{it is clear that}} we shall be adding quantities measured in different units, and so this leads to meaningless results. Secondly, if we rescale one of the variables e.g., measure in grams rather than kilograms, then we shall end up with different results (a different curve). To avoid this problem of incommensurability it is sometimes suggested that we convert to dimensionless variables—this may be called normalization or standardization. However there are various ways of doing this, and these lead to fitted models which are not equivalent to each other. One approach is to normalize by known (or estimated) measurement precision thereby minimizing the Mahalanobis distance from the points to the line, providing a maximum-likelihood solution; the unknown precisions could be found via analysis of variance.|$|E

25|$|The ordinary, familiar, {{everyday}} {{things and}} occurrences we have, constitute occasions {{for the experience}} of God. Such things as one's daily sustenance, the very day itself, are felt as manifestations of God's loving-kindness, calling for the Berakhot. Kedushah, holiness, which is nothing else than the imitation of God, is concerned with daily conduct, with being gracious and merciful, with keeping oneself from defilement by idolatry, adultery, and the shedding of blood. The Birkat Ha-Mitzwot evokes the consciousness of holiness at a rabbinic rite, but the objects employed {{in the majority of}} these rites are non-holy and of general character, while the several holy objects are non-theurgic. And not only do ordinary things and occurrences bring with them the experience of God. Everything that happens to a man evokes that experience, evil as well as good, for a Berakah is said also at evil tidings. Hence, although the experience of God is like none other, the occasions for experiencing Him, for having a consciousness of Him, are manifold, even <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>consider</b> only those that call for Berakot.|$|E
500|$|Yesterday Major BOYLE Roche, {{representative}} in parliament for Tralee (who is raising {{a body of}} men for his Majesty's service) began recruiting here, and met with great success, which is not surprising, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>consider</b> his connexions, and the uncommon support he has received from the noblemen and gentlemen of this province. His method of enlisting was as uncommon as it was pleasing to those who viewed the procession, which was as follows: Major Roche, bearing a large purse of gold. Captain Cowley. A great number of likely recruits. An elegant band of music, consisting of French horns, hautboys , clarionets, and bassoons, playing God Save the King. A large brewer's dray, with five-barrels of beer, the horse richly caparisoned and ornamented with ribbands. Two draymen with cockades to serve the beer, The recruiting serjeant. Drums [...] fifes. Another division of recruits. The returning soldiers.

The laurels fought for and obtained in all parts [...] the globe [...] war, have procured us a fame so glorious as not to be equalled by people in any fame not to be sullied by the assaults of prejudice, nor the effects of time: not an action in which we were not victorious, not a siege in which we were not honoured. Will you, my dear countrymen, permit those laurels to fade, or those actions to be forgotten? No, forbid it, heaven! Let us now that we have it in our power convey to later posterity a renewal of our fidelity, and a confirmation of our loyalty. A more critical period never presented itself, nor had we ever a fairer opportunity of shewing our attachment to the illustrious house of Hanover, than the present, as his Majesty's deluded subjects in America are in open rebellion, and like unnatural children, wound their ever indulgent parent, forgetting the torrents of blood spilt, and heap of treasure expended for their preservation. His Sacred Majesty now calls and our fidelity obliges us, and I hope your instinct prompts you, to obey the dictates of so [...] a master. Let us then, my brave and loyal countrymen, join hearts and hands and cheerfully step forth in the glorious cause of our Creator, our King and our Country.|$|E
