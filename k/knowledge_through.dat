5|$|John Horsefield (18 July 1792– 6 March 1854) was an English {{handloom}} weaver {{and amateur}} botanist after whom the daffodil Narcissus 'Horsfieldii' is named. Horsefield had little formal schooling, and acquired {{most of his}} botanical <b>knowledge</b> <b>through</b> self-study and involvement in local botanical groups, which provided a venue for working class people to share knowledge, in part by pooling money to purchase books.|$|E
5|$|Many {{animals can}} learn {{behaviours}} by imitation, but ants {{may be the}} only group apart from mammals where interactive teaching has been observed. A knowledgeable forager of Temnothorax albipennis will lead a naive nest-mate to newly discovered food by the process of tandem running. The follower obtains <b>knowledge</b> <b>through</b> its leading tutor. The leader is acutely sensitive to the progress of the follower and slows down when the follower lags and speeds up when the follower gets too close.|$|E
5|$|The Varaha Upanishad, in Chapter 4, {{states that}} {{individuals}} gain <b>knowledge</b> <b>through</b> seven stages: First, one must have virtuous desire to learn, discover (Subh-echchha). The second stage is inquiry, investigation (Vichārana). Discernment and thinning of mind toward other objects (Tanumanasi) {{is the third}} stage, states the text. The fourth stage is harmony, creative union with the subject of knowledge (Sattva-patti). Detachment from everything else (Asamsakti) is the fifth stage. Conceptual analysis and gaining complete, correct meaning of the topic (Pad-artha-bhavana) is the sixth stage. The seventh or last stage is Turiya, complete consciousness.|$|E

40|$|Instead {{of making}} R&D expenditures, {{developing}} countries generally obtain technology either directly by transferring technology or indirectly by importing technology contained commodities. In this study, using the Turkey’s case, {{the relationship between}} foreign trade and economic growth is investigated in terms of <b>knowledge</b> transfer <b>through</b> foreign trade for the period 1989 - 2009. Using Johansen cointegration method and VAR methodology, the effect of <b>knowledge</b> transfer <b>through</b> foreign trade on economic growth is investigated in terms of direction and dimension. The estimations reveal that <b>knowledge</b> transfer <b>through</b> capital and intermediate goods imports has no significant effect on economic growth of Turkey in the period investigated. Comparisons of variables show {{that the effect of}} <b>knowledge</b> transfer <b>through</b> less <b>knowledge</b> contained intermediate goods imports is higher than the effect of <b>knowledge</b> transfer <b>through</b> high <b>knowledge</b> contained capital goods imports. This result implies that Turkey should import more capital goods and have enough human capital to use technology within capital goods...|$|R

25|$|Rationalism - as {{an appeal}} to human reason {{as a way of}} obtaining {{knowledge}} - has a philosophical history dating from antiquity. The analytical nature of much of philosophical enquiry, the awareness of apparently a priori domains of knowledge such as mathematics, combined with the emphasis of obtaining <b>knowledge</b> <b>through</b> the use of rational faculties (commonly rejecting, for example, direct revelation) have made rationalist themes very prevalent in the history of philosophy.|$|E
25|$|Aeschylus {{was one of}} many Greeks {{who were}} {{initiated}} into the Eleusinian Mysteries, an ancient cult of Demeter based in his hometown of Eleusis.

25|$|Writing is {{a medium}} of human {{communication}} that represents language and emotion with signs and symbols. In most languages, {{writing is a}} complement to speech or spoken language. Writing is not a language, but a tool used to make languages be read. Within a language system, writing relies {{on many of the}} same structures as speech, such as vocabulary, grammar, and semantics, with the added dependency of a system of signs or symbols. The result of writing is called text, and the recipient of text is called a reader. Motivations for writing include publication, storytelling, correspondence and diary. Writing has been instrumental in keeping history, maintaining culture, dissemination of <b>knowledge</b> <b>through</b> the media and the formation of legal systems.|$|E
25|$|By 1920, {{the dental}} service had been demobilised. During the interwar years, {{the focus of}} Australia's {{military}} planning was upon maintaining a reduced permanent force with a larger part-time military force. The need for dental services was thus greatly reduced and, as a result, they were largely provided by civilian dentists that were also serving in the Militia, although {{a small number of}} permanent dental staff were retained on the establishment. Nevertheless, in 1928 an inspector of dental services was appointed, and although training opportunities were limited due to the economic hardships of the Great Depression, throughout the interwar years the service developed its capabilities and corporate <b>knowledge</b> <b>through</b> a series of tactical exercises.|$|E
25|$|Female {{religious}} scholars {{were relatively}} common from early Islamic history throughout the 16th century. Mohammad Akram Nadwi, a Sunni religious scholar, has listed 8,000 female jurists, and orientalist Ignaz Goldziher estimates 15 percent of medieval hadith scholars were women. Women, during {{early history of}} Islam, primarily obtained their <b>knowledge</b> <b>through</b> community study groups, ribat retreats and during hajj when the usual restrictions imposed on female education were more lenient. After the 16th century, however, female scholars became fewer. In the modern era, while female activists and writers are relatively common, {{there has not been}} a significant female jurist in over 200 years. Opportunities for women's religious education exist, but cultural barriers often keep women from pursuing such a vocation.|$|E
