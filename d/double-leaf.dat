5|$|The {{neighborhoods that}} make up West Seattle are on a {{peninsula}} separated from downtown by the Duwamish River. The West Seattle Bridge is the primary roadway crossing the river. The neighborhood's Spokane Street Bridge is the world's first and only hydraulically operated concrete <b>double-leaf</b> swing bridge.|$|E
5|$|Michigan Avenue Bridge is a <b>double-leaf,</b> double-deck, fixed counterweight, {{trunnion}} bascule bridge. It was {{engineered by}} the Chicago Department of Public Works, Bureau of Engineering; Edward H. Bennett was the consulting architect and William A. Mulcahy {{the chief engineer}} of construction. At the time of construction it {{was believed to be}} the first double-deck bridge ever built to have roadway on both levels; faster non-commercial traffic using the upper deck and slower commercial traffic that served the various industries and docks in the vicinity of the river using the lower deck.|$|E
5|$|Route 3 {{crosses the}} Passaic River {{on a fixed}} bridge, which {{replaced}} a <b>double-leaf</b> trunnion bascule bridge in 2013, into Rutherford, Bergen County. Just after crossing the river, the route interchanges with County Route 507 (Riverside Avenue). The freeway continues through a residential area and comes to an exit that provides access to southbound Route 17. Past this interchange, Route 3 is closely paralleled by Route 17 to the south until Route 3 interchanges again with Route 17, which continues {{to the north of}} Route 3.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, the City of Bridgeport {{created a}} special {{commission}} {{to oversee the}} construction of a bridge at Congress Street. A local engineer, Raymond F. Stoddard was hired as design consultant and obtained the license to use the Scherzer design. A Scherzer rolling-lift bridge with a <b>double-leaf</b> bascule was chosen for construction. The design is a Deck-type plate girder bridge; using two plate girders to support the deck. The Scherzer bascule was a popular design because it avoided the expense of high-stress pivot bearings; though it requires stronger foundations to support the weight of the bridge's operation. The engineering firm, J. R. Worcester and Company designed and constructed the concrete-arch approach and Fort Pitt Bridge Works fabricated the movable bridge. The cost of construction was $300,000, which was offset through funding from the Connecticut Company. A contemporary account from the Hartford Courant gave stated the contract was for $305,000 to Snare, Tristo and Company. The bridge was opened to the public July 16, 1910.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Street Bridge was a <b>double-leaf</b> deck-girder {{bascule bridge}} in Bridgeport, Connecticut, United States, that spanned the Pequonnock River and {{connected}} Grand Street and Artic Street. It {{was one of}} three movable bridges planned by the City of Bridgeport in 1916 {{at the request of the}} War Department during World War I. Construction was completed in 1919, but the delays surrounding the construction went to the Connecticut Supreme Court in case of Edward DeV. Tompkins, Inc. vs. City of Bridgeport, Connecticut. The court ruled in favor of Tompkins and awarded damages equal to the contract. In 1936, the bridge had excessive settling and required the replacement of its southeast pier. As part of the repairs, a new floor and electrical system were installed. In 1965, the floor was replaced with a steel grate on I-beam floor. In 1984, the eastern approach span was replaced and the northwest trunnion post was reconstructed. The bridge was closed in the 1990s and dismantled in 1999.|$|E
5|$|The Charles Payne House is a -story Gothic-Italianate vernacular cottage {{that has}} a spacious garden founded {{on the site of}} a long-removed house. The house's gable end faces the street with a rear ell and the other ell {{perpendicular}} to the main block on the west side. Centered on the east end of the roof is a cross gable which is visually offset by the dormer on the west. The house has a small gable-roofed vestibule on the east side, aligned underneath the cross-gable. The rear ell has an attached porch that spans its length. A single story bay hexagonal bay window protrudes from the facade. The distinguishing feature of the Payne house is the wood trim exterior, consisting of hood mould on the paired windows on the south, four kinds of bargeboards and bracketed cornices on the rear ell's east side. The interior of the Charles Payne House is not covered in detail by any survey, but has three mantelpieces on the first floor, two displaying Gothic Revival influence in their wooden designs and the third, located in the rear ell, made of grey marble with a round-head opening. Though not mentioned in the nomination, a photo shows one of the wooden mantlepieces filled with brick and rendered unusable at the time. The setting of the house was important to the National Register nomination, which specifically highlighted its shaded garden and fencing. At the time of the nomination, an ornamental round head picket fence surrounded the property and access was through a <b>double-leaf</b> lattice work gate. By 2013, the picket fence and entrance gate had been removed, but the property still retains the street frontage for its garden.|$|E

Secondary roads, most {{in the process of}} growing over, branch out from it at intervals.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} kinds of doors, with {{different}} purposes. The most common type is the single-leaf door, which consists of a single rigid panel that fills the doorway. There are many variations on this basic design, such as the <b>double-leaf</b> door or double door and French windows, which have two adjacent independent panels hinged {{on each side of}} the doorway.|$|E
25|$|At {{the main}} {{entrance}} are three doors. Apart from {{the main entrance}}, all other entrances, except for the one fronting Victoria Street, have only one door. The entrance fronting Victoria Street had three doors initially until the walling up of the centre door. All doors are <b>double-leaf,</b> of timber construct and, except for the two fronting Victoria Street, all are panelled. While {{the doors of the}} two side entrances at the nave are double the height of the doors found at the ends of the transept, these four doors have each a stained-glass window over them.|$|E
25|$|Built in 1924, and {{designed}} by North Carolina architect Charles C. Hartmann, Morrison Hall {{was named for}} Cameron A. Morrison, former Governor of North Carolina. Placed along university circle, and located south of Noble Hall, and adjacent to the Dudley Building; Morrison Hall was constructed to be nearly identical to that of Noble hall, {{with the exception of}} its rusticated stone that surrounds the building's main entrance, as opposed to the brick used on Noble. Another distinctive feature of the building is the carved and incised stone name panel above the non-functional balcony that extends to surround the center third story windows, in addition to retaining its original <b>double-leaf</b> main entrance door. Today, Morrison Hall still serves its original purpose as a residence hall, housing 109 students.|$|E

500|$|Pamban Bridge is a {{cantilever}} bridge on the Palk Strait that connects Rameswaram to mainland India. The railway bridge is [...] and was opened to traffic in 1914. The railroad bridge is a <b>double-leaf</b> bascule bridge section {{that can be}} raised to let ships pass under it [...] The railway bridge historically carried metre-gauge trains on it, but Indian Railways upgraded the bridge to carry broad-gauge trains in a project that finished on 12 August 2007. Historically, the two leaves of the bridge were opened manually using levers by workers. About 10 ships – cargo carriers, coast guard ships, fishing vessels and oil tankers pass through the bridge every month. After completion of bridge, metre-gauge lines were laid from Mandapam up to Pamban Station, from where the railway lines bifurcated into two directions, one towards Rameswaram about [...] up and another branch line of [...] terminating at Dhanushkodi. The noted Boat Mail ran on this track between 1915 and 1964 from Chennai Egmore up to Dhanushkodi, from where the passengers were ferried to Talaimannar in Ceylon.

2500|$|Stock with air-doors {{first entered}} {{service on the}} London Underground in 1921, and from 1923 Standard Stock {{operated}} on the Hampstead line, and these allowed staff to be reduced to front and rear guards and a driver. A Central London car was experimentally rebuilt with air-doors in 1925, and by 1928 all cars had been converted, the work being carried out at the Union Construction Company at Feltham. The end platforms were enclosed and trailer cars were equipped with two [...] openings with a single leaf sliding doors on each side. Motor cars had a single larger opening with a <b>double-leaf</b> sliding door and a guard's compartment with a hinged door. The sliding doors were pneumatically operated, later assisted with electrically controlled exhaust valves to speed up opening. In 1926/27, whilst the conversion was in progress, two six-car trains of 1906 Stock and 1920 Stock were borrowed from the Piccadilly line, the trailers fitted with smaller wheels {{to allow them to}} run in the smaller Central London tunnels.
