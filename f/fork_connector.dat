40|$|It appears most {{probable}} that the Watts linkage {{of the aircraft}} has experienced a tensile overload superimposed with bending stresses during {{which one of the}} bolts of the <b>fork</b> <b>connector</b> between the pogo stick and the frame got sheared off. Evidences also suggest that both the bolts of the <b>fork</b> <b>connector</b> were present at the time of failure and there were no abnormalities in the assembly. Tell tale marks on the inner surface of the fork of the link assembly suggest that the bolt connecting the lever and the link assembly of the control linkage port PFCU was present prior to the accident. Evidences also suggest that this joint has experienced compressive force due to impact leading to shearing off of the bolt and subsequent dislodgement of all the attaching parts. Certain damages were seen on the bolts and/or nuts of control linkage starboard PFCU and engine throttle control linkage in question, which probably have been caused by split pins. This means that split pins were present in these bolts at some given time during their service life. It was not possible to ascertain whether or not these bolts were fitted with split pins prior to the accident. ...|$|E
50|$|A {{detailed}} inspection on 24 January found a stress fracture {{in a second}} support cable stay, like the one which had failed previously. Engineers determined {{that all of these}} connectors would have to be replaced; rather than a brief closure the bridge would have to remain closed for six months. In addition traffic on the river below was also halted. In March Nuttall began installing five temporary saddle frames atop the bridge's arch; these allowed the weight of the bridge to be supported without the hangers. This allowed them to replace defective <b>fork</b> <b>connectors</b> at {{the top and bottom of}} each hanger.|$|R
40|$|In {{this note}} we {{show how the}} {{formalism}} of eXtended Positional Grammars (XPGs) allow us to model a wide class of statecharts. Statecharts are a very rich graphical specification formalism. They are an extension of conventional finite state machines with more powerful concepts such as hierarchy of states, orthogonality, interlevel transitions, etc. It is widely recognized that the main difficulties for modelling statecharts derive from the presence of interlevel transitions, multiple source/multiple target transitions, joint and <b>fork</b> <b>connectors,</b> and history connectors [3, 4]. The class of statecharts language described by XPG formalism is that proposed in the commercial tool STATEMATE [3] with the constraint that consecutive joints or forks are not admitted. In the following we will sketch how the formalism of XPGs allows us to effectively capture such characteristics. We start by recalling some basic notions concerning with XPGs (a more complete description {{can be found in}} [2]). In such a formalism a visual sentence is conceived as a set of attributed graphical objects, where each object i...|$|R
