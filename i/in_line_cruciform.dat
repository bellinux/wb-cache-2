50|$|Adjacent to {{the famous}} Mosque of Ibn Tulun, the Madrasa of Sarghatmish {{is a prime example}} of Mamluk {{architectural}} innovation. The building's four iwan layout is <b>in</b> <b>line</b> with the <b>cruciform,</b> or cross-shaped, madrasa plan. The building's facade faces the street to the northwest, and the domed mausoleum jets out from the south end of the facade and into the street through a rectangular, cross-vaulted space. This madrasa shows the tendency of Mamluk architecture to prefer that the front of the building faces the existing street, while at the same time orienting the interior of the mosque toward the qibla. In this case, the facade is composed of the madrasa and mausoleum, and the mosque is located behind the facade, furthest from the street. This choice to make the secular aspects of the building visible to the public, reflects the Mamluks' tendency to value prestige over piety. The mausoleum was also presented in this fashion in order to attract the attention of pedestrians in hopes of receiving their blessings.|$|R

2500|$|The meter demands several variant pronunciations: <b>In</b> <b>line</b> three [...] "labouring" [...] has two syllables; <b>in</b> <b>line</b> five [...] "recórd" [...] {{although}} signifying the noun we pronounce [...] "récord"; <b>in</b> <b>line</b> six [...] "even" [...] has one syllable; <b>in</b> <b>line</b> seven [...] "ántique"; <b>in</b> <b>line</b> 10 [...] "composed" [...] {{has three}} syllables; <b>in</b> <b>line</b> 11 [...] "whether" [...] has one like the following [...] "where" [...] (which {{may or may}} not be an alternate spelling of the same word), although [...] "whether" [...] <b>in</b> the next <b>line</b> has the usual two syllables; <b>in</b> <b>line</b> 14 [...] "given" [...] has one syllable.|$|R

5000|$|The meter demands several contractions: one-syllable [...] "being" [...] <b>in</b> <b>line</b> 7 and [...] "even" [...] <b>in</b> <b>line</b> 11, and — {{somewhat}} controversially — a three-syllable [...] "melancholy" [...] (probably pronounced mel-an-ch'ly) <b>in</b> <b>line</b> 8.|$|R

40|$|Several {{lines of}} lymphatic leukemia in mice, {{experimentally}} transmitted by inoculation into hosts of a closely inbred strain, {{have been established}} and carried on simultaneously. Among the inoculated mice there were found different types of response, according {{to the line of}} leukemia inoculated. The differences consisted mainly in the extent or distribution of lesions. Although the same line did not always show the same distribution of lesions, there was a distinct tendency for the cases <b>in</b> a <b>line</b> to present the same characteristics on successive transfers over a considerable period. A comparison of the frequency of the occurrence of certain lesions <b>in</b> four <b>lines</b> of transmission shows that: 1. Increases in the total leucocyte counts were less common and less marked <b>in</b> <b>Lines</b> A and E than <b>in</b> <b>Lines</b> H and I. <b>In</b> the <b>lines</b> first mentioned, normal counts were relatively frequent. <b>In</b> <b>Line</b> H normal counts were uncommon, and <b>in</b> <b>Line</b> I were not observed. The highest counts were found <b>in</b> <b>Line</b> I. 2. Peritoneal effusion was characteristic of Line A for 43 transfers. It was found <b>in</b> <b>Line</b> E, but for a considerably shorter period and in a smaller proportion of cases; it was rare <b>in</b> <b>Lines</b> H and I. 3. Pleural effusion was frequently found <b>in</b> <b>Lines</b> A and E but rarely <b>in</b> <b>Lines</b> H and I. 4. Infiltration in the liver occurred to a marked degree in all the mice of Lines H and I, but in fewer mice and to a variable degree <b>in</b> <b>Lines</b> A and E. 5. Infiltration in the kidney <b>in</b> <b>Line</b> I was present in 90 per cent of the mice, and was of marked grade. <b>In</b> <b>line</b> H it was present in 67 per cent of the mice (24 per cent of marked grade) but <b>in</b> <b>Lines</b> A and E it was rare. 6. A considerable amount of variability in results occurred <b>in</b> <b>Lines</b> A and E, whereas Lines H and I remained remarkably constant. The lesions characteristic of a line were not necessarily those present in the spontaneous case from which the first transfer of the line was made. As the mice used for inoculation were genetically uniform, the differences between the lines are not due to genetic differences in the hosts, but to differences in the materials inoculated...|$|R
