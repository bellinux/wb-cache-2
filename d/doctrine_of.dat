5|$|Calvin's {{theology}} caused controversy. Pierre Caroli, a Protestant {{minister in}} Lausanne accused Calvin {{as well as}} Viret and Farel of Arianism in 1536. Calvin defended his beliefs on the Trinity in Confessio de Trinitate propter calumnias P. Caroli. In 1551 Jérôme-Hermès Bolsec, a physician in Geneva, attacked Calvin's <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> predestination and accused him of making God the author of sin. Bolsec was banished from the city, and after Calvin's death, he wrote a biography which severely maligned Calvin's character. In the following year, Joachim Westphal, a Gnesio-Lutheran pastor in Hamburg, condemned Calvin and Zwingli as heretics in denying the eucharistic <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> the union of Christ's body with the elements. Calvin's Defensio sanae et orthodoxae doctrinae de sacramentis (A Defence of the Sober and Orthodox <b>Doctrine</b> <b>of</b> the Sacrament) was his response in 1555. In 1556 , a Dutch dissident, held a public disputation with Calvin {{during his visit to}} Frankfurt, in which Velsius defended free will against Calvin's <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> predestination. Following the execution of Servetus, a close associate of Calvin, Sebastian Castellio, broke with him {{on the issue of the}} treatment of heretics. In Castellio's Treatise on Heretics (1554), he argued for a focus on Christ's moral teachings in place of the vanity of theology, and he afterward developed a theory of tolerance based on biblical principles.|$|E
5|$|Cases in the United Kingdom were {{previously}} inconsistent upon {{the issue of}} permitting representative standing. Nevertheless, it may now be confidently said that the UK courts recognize, in principle, the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> representative standing, and will apply it in suitable cases.|$|E
5|$|Commentators noted, however, {{that the}} Court's ruling was narrow in scope, {{and did not}} set a broad legal {{precedent}} {{with respect to the}} applicability of the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> patent exhaustion to self-replicating technologies.|$|E
50|$|In the <b>doctrines</b> <b>of</b> the New Church, {{there is}} a {{complete}} review and assessment <b>of</b> the <b>doctrines</b> <b>of</b> the former churches. Before the New Church can be received, the <b>doctrines</b> <b>of</b> the older churches must be exposed in the open and rejected. This is because {{the faith of the}} New Church is so opposite to the <b>doctrines</b> <b>of</b> the older Christian churches that they cannot coexist. An assessment of other beliefs also helps to clarify the position of the New Church, and explains why a revelation was needed to correct the theological direction of the Christian churches.|$|R

40|$|The <b>doctrines</b> <b>of</b> {{good faith}} and fair dealing, {{fiduciary}} duty, and unjust enrichment are <b>doctrines</b> <b>of</b> last resort {{because they are}} activated only when all other potentially applicable commands from constitutions, statutes, regulations, ordinances, common law decisions and contracts have been exhausted. In these circumstances ⎯ where positive law and private ordering are otherwise incomplete ⎯ contracting parties rely heavily on informal social sanctions to protect against opportunism, but the <b>doctrines</b> <b>of</b> last resort reinforce these social sanctions. Rather than regulating all of the deviations and adjustments that are common in contractual relationships, <b>doctrines</b> <b>of</b> last resort constrain extreme deviations from social norms, reinforcing agreements precisely in those contexts where informal social sanctions are weakest...|$|R

5|$|In the mid-to-late 1930s, Japanese {{forces in}} Manchukuo had {{sporadic}} border clashes with the Soviet Union and the Mongolian People's Republic. The Japanese <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> Hokushin-ron, which emphasised Japan's expansion northward, was favoured by the Imperial Army during this time. With the Japanese defeat at Khalkin Gol in 1939, the ongoing Second Sino-Japanese War and ally Nazi Germany pursuing neutrality with the Soviets, this policy would prove difficult to maintain. Japan and the Soviet Union eventually signed a Neutrality Pact in April 1941, and Japan adopted the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> Nanshin-ron, {{promoted by the}} Navy, which took its focus southward, eventually leading to its war with the United States and the Western Allies.|$|E
5|$|Parliament is {{not bound}} by the common law, {{and as a result}} several acts of {{parliament}} unwittingly create valid exceptions to the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> privity. Under the Road Traffic Act 1988, motorists are obliged to take out third party liability insurance. This means that victims of car accidents can claim money from the insurer of the driver at fault, even though they {{are not part of the}} original contract. Under the Married Women's Property Act 1882 a husband can take out insurance in his own name, but make it enforceable by his wife and children despite the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> privity.|$|E

5|$|The 1926 Imperial Conference {{resulted}} in the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927, and the Balfour Declaration 1926, which granted the Dominions equal status to the United Kingdom. However, laws passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom still had force in Australia, and laws passed by Australian parliaments would be invalid if they contradicted United Kingdom laws (the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> repugnancy). The Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942 ended the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> repugnancy, and provided that United Kingdom laws would only have force in Australia at Australia's request.|$|E
5|$|The medieval <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> divine {{simplicity}} also poses {{problems for}} religious language. This suggests that God has no accidental properties– these are properties that a being can have {{which do not}} contribute to its essence. If God has no accidental properties, he cannot be as he is traditionally conceived, because properties such as goodness are accidental. If divine simplicity is accepted, then to describe God as good would entail that goodness and God have the same definition. Such limits can also be problematic to religious believers; for example, the Bible regularly ascribes different emotions to God, ascriptions which would be implausible according to the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> divine simplicity.|$|E

5|$|A {{particular}} viewpoint {{is called}} a naya or a partial viewpoint. According to Vijay Jain, Nayavada does not deny the attributes, qualities, modes and other aspects; but qualifies them to be from a particular perspective. A naya reveals {{only a part of}} the totality, and should not be mistaken for the whole. A synthesis of different viewpoints is said to be achieved by the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> conditional predications (syādvāda).|$|E
5|$|According to Jainism, no single, {{specific}} statement {{can describe}} {{the nature of}} existence and the absolute truth.

5|$|As per Tulsidas, Rama is the {{efficient}} and material cause (Nimitta and Upadana) of the world, which is real since Rama is real. In several verses of the Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas {{says that the}} animate and inanimate world is a manifestation of Rama, and the universe is the cosmic form of Rama. Authors interpret these verses to mean {{that the world is}} real according to Tulsidas, in keeping with the Vishishtadvaita philosophy of Ramanuja. However, at some places in the Ramcharitmanas and Kavitavali, Tulsidas compares the world to a night or a dream and says it is Mithya (false or unreal). Some commentators interpret these verses to mean that in Tulsidas' opinion the world is unreal as per the Vivartavada <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> Adi Shankara, while some others interpret them to mean that the world is transient yet real as per the Satkhyativada <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> Ramananda. Uday Bhanu Singh concludes that in Tulsidas' view, the world is essentially the form of Rama and appears to be different from Rama due to Maya. Its visible form is transient, which is what Tulsidas means by Mithya.|$|E
