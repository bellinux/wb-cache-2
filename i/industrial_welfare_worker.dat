40|$|The International Industrial Relations Institute (IRI) was {{established}} in 1925 at a congress of welfare and personnel workers in Holland. At first the organisation focused attention on scientific management and industrial relations but during the Great Depression its activities began to centre upon economic planning. The IRI was dominated by Mary van Kleeck from the United States and its radicalisation reflected her development into a dedicated advocate of Soviet style planning. One of the initiators of the IRI was a Swedish <b>industrial</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>worker</b> and its first president was Kerstin Hesselgren, Sweden’s first female factory inspector and member of parliament. The organisation had about 20 Swedish members around 1930 – mostly female personnel or welfare workers, factory inspectors, trade union activists and a few male managing directors – {{but over the next}} couple of years these fell away. The story of Hesselgren, van Kleeck and the IRI has at least two interesting aspects. Firstly, it reflects the transformation of social engineering from an issue of industrial relations to one of economic planning. Secondly, it tells us something about the American influence on Sweden in the area of industrial relations. The more precise question to be answered is why a number of Swedes first joined and then abandoned the IRI. The article argues that Hesselgren had most likely been impressed by van Kleeck before the forming of the IRI and that she brought her fellow Swedes with her into the organisation. However, the Swedes could not follow van Kleeck when she became an advocate for Soviet style planning...|$|E

Haskins was closely {{involved with the}} establishment in 1924 of the Institute of <b>Industrial</b> <b>Welfare</b> <b>Workers,</b> the successor to the Welfare Workers' Institute and the precursor {{to what is now}} the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPP). The CIPP is the worlds oldest association in its field. During this time, Haskins wrote two novels Through Beds of Stone (1928) and A Few People (1932) and a further volume of poetry Smoking Flax (1942).|$|R
5000|$|By {{the time}} enough {{theoretical}} evidence existed {{to make a}} business case for strategic workforce management, changes in the business landscape (à la Andrew Carnegie, John Rockefeller) and in public policy (à la Sidney and Beatrice Webb, Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal) had transformed the employer-employee relationship, and the discipline became formalized as [...] "industrial and labor relations". In 1913 {{one of the oldest}} known professional HR associations—the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD)—started in England as the Welfare Workers' Association; it changed its name a decade later to the Institute of <b>Industrial</b> <b>Welfare</b> <b>Workers,</b> and again the next decade to Institute of Labour Management before settling upon its current name in 2000. Likewise in the United States, the world's first institution of higher education dedicated to workplace studies—the School of Industrial and Labor Relations—formed at Cornell University in 1945. In 1948 what would later become the largest professional HR association—the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM)—formed as the American Society for Personnel Administration (ASPA).|$|R
50|$|In November 1919, {{following}} {{merger with}} welfare associations for men the Central Association of <b>Welfare</b> <b>Workers</b> (<b>Industrial)</b> was renamed the Welfare Workers' Institute and {{now had a}} membership of 700. However, {{the next five years}} saw a reduction in membership to 250 coinciding with the rapid collapse in industrial output as the government sought to reduce the national debt. Again in 1924 on incorporation the organisation changed its name to the Institute of <b>Industrial</b> <b>Welfare</b> <b>Workers</b> (IIWW). Minnie Louise Haskins, the author of the famous poem The Gate of the Year and a lecturer at LSE, was closely involved with the IIWW and edited its monthly bulletin. As a consequence of the activities of <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> during the General Strike of 1926 distrust in the welfare movement grew amongst trade unions which saw a new breed of 'labour managers' part of 'management' which was reflected in 1931 when the IIWW became the Institute of Labour Management and its magazine, rebranded Labour Management. Members of the institute experienced new demands during the 1930s. Firstly, economic growth resulted in a shortfall in skilled labour as companies competed to recruit workers. Secondly, this was followed by lay-offs and industrial action as a world-wide depression took hold, particularly in the industrially-focussed north of England. This influence also had the effect of increasing the number of male members of the institute which significantly shifted the gender balance of the membership. Thirdly, new human relations practices developed in the US were finding their way into more enlightened business which invested in their employees through training and provision of such things as salary benefits, pensions and paid holidays. In 1938 the first of the institute branches opened in the Republic of Ireland. In 1939 membership stood at 760. Mirroring the First World War during World War II, the government insisted on personnel officers to be deployed in factories engaged in war-related production.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Social <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> {{employed}} in the same county base their assessments on the same laws, routines and guidelines, yet it seems that they sometimes come to different decisions. It's the discretion that enables the social workers to make individualized decisions adapted to each clients unique situation. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to examine social <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> reflections on discretion and what influences their discretion in the professional role. Six qualitative interviews were conducted with social <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> in three communitys i the middle of Sweden. The main result shows that it is primarily four factors that affect the social <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> discretion in the professional role : External factors such as other organizations change of regulations and cooperation with other organizations. Organizational factors such as routines, rules and guidelines. Professional factors such as the opportunity to use experience and professional knowledge to determine which measure works in different situations. Individual factors like the workers ability for initiative and the clients individual circumstances. Social <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> feel that they have a relatively wide discretion in their profession. They believe they have the ability to make individual evaluations of each client, however they also believe that their discretion often is limited by lack of time. Key words: social <b>welfare</b> <b>workers,</b> clients, discretion, assessments. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the personal viewpoints about corporal punishment of child <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> in California???s Central Valley counties. This secondary analysis was part of a larger pre-existing study that examined child <b>welfare</b> <b>workers???</b> opinions and knowledge about physical punishment of children. The study was adapted from a study administered from the American Academy of Pediatrics. This quantitative study utilized an electronic survey that was distributed through Qualtrics Survey Software where participants had access to the survey through an email link. A total of 1, 125 participants started the survey and 971 participants completed the entire survey. A major finding of this study was that child <b>welfare</b> <b>workers???</b> personal opinions of corporal punishment influence their professional opinions of corporal punishment the majority of the time. Another major finding was that an overwhelmingly large majority of child <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> support the use of corporal punishment by parents in the home. Future studies should explore whether an individual???s demographic variables, especially religious affiliation, influences child <b>welfare</b> <b>workers???</b> opinions and practices regarding corporal punishment. It would be additionally important to examine whether child <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> have received any professional education or information regarding the effects of corporal punishment on children...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this essay is to further {{investigate}} and describe psychological strains experienced by child <b>welfare</b> <b>workers.</b> The method used was qualitative interviews, two group interviews. The research aimed to understand how child <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> were affected and handled the psychological strains generated by work through theory of coping and symbolic interactionism where humans are viewed as pragmatic actors. The research showed, as previous studies shown, that the child <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> experience {{a great deal of}} psychological strains generated by high turnover in staff and pressuring work demands. The child <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> felt inadequate and alone in their work tasks and experienced stress and anxiety. Coping was mainly used to regulate the emotional response of stressful situations instead of changing them, which is an effect of the limited possibilities to affect the working conditions. The support from colleagues was of limited resource but also an important coping strategy. The emotional strain of the high turnover in staff made the child <b>welfare</b> <b>workers</b> distanced from new staff, which leaves the workers lacking more support. The authors of this essay believes that lack of support and increased workload, affected by the high turnover in staff, results in staff leaving child welfare. ...|$|R
