5|$|A month later, Banner is in Bella Coola, British Columbia. Instead {{of trying}} to {{suppress}} his transformation, he successfully transforms <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>manner.</b> In a final scene, Tony Stark approaches Ross at a local bar and informs him a team is being put together.|$|E
5|$|After {{weeks of}} secret {{negotiations}} between merchants and protest leaders, an agreement was finally reached {{during the first}} week of May. According to the agreement, small, selected groups of African Americans would order food at the downtown lunch counters on a day known in advance to the merchants. The merchants would prepare their employees for the event and instruct them to serve the customers without trouble. This arrangement would continue <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>manner</b> for a couple of weeks and then all controls would be taken off, at which point the merchants and protest leaders would reconvene to evaluate the results. Also as part of the agreement, the media was to be informed of the settlement and requested to provide only accurate, non-sensational coverage.|$|E
5|$|Five sets of sluices and two weirs {{are used}} to control the canal's depth. The sluices, located at Mode Wheel Locks, Barton Locks, Irlam Locks, Latchford Locks and Weaver Sluices, are {{designed}} to allow water entering the canal to flow along its length <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>manner.</b> Each consists {{of a set of}} mechanically driven vertical steel roller gates, supported by masonry piers. Originally, manually operated Stoney Sluices were used; these were replaced in the 1950s by electrically driven units, with automation technology introduced from the late 1980s. The sluices are protected against damage from drifting vessels by large concrete barriers. Stop logs can be inserted by roving cranes, installed upstream of each sluice; at Weaver Sluices, accessed by boat, this task is performed by a floating crane.|$|E
50|$|Also, {{positive}} feedback is {{positively related to}} intrinsic motivation and satisfaction {{so long as the}} feedback is not relayed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>manner.</b> Word choice can negatively influence autonomy even under conditions of {{positive feedback}} if the feedback is given <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>manner,</b> such as by indicating that someone {{is doing a good job}} and that they “should” continue the work, as opposed to simply indicating that they are performing well (Deci, Koestner, & Ryan, 1999).|$|R

25|$|Lift bags {{also can}} be used for static lifts, where the bag is {{anchored}} in place by rigging, and used as a lifting point with very high buoyancy compared to the load, which is then lifted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>manner</b> using a purchase or chain block or other suitable lifting device.|$|E
25|$|Chemical peels are {{chemicals}} which {{destroy the}} epidermis <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>manner,</b> leading to exfoliation and the alleviation of certain skin conditions, including superficial acne scars. Various chemicals {{can be used}} depending upon {{the depth of the}} peel, and caution should be used, particularly for dark-skinned individuals and those individuals susceptible to keloid formation or with active infections.|$|E
25|$|Another {{variation}} {{is called the}} funeral pyre method because it is used for building funeral pyres. Its main difference from the standard log cabin is that it starts with thin pieces and moves up to thick pieces. If built on a large scale, this type of fire-build collapses <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>manner</b> without restricting the air flow.|$|E
50|$|Compared to the {{operation}} of other spud guns, dry ice bomb cannons are similar in firing principle to a light-gas gun of the pneumatic type; the plastic bottle performing {{the task of the}} burst disk albeit <b>in</b> <b>a</b> less <b>controlled</b> <b>manner.</b>|$|R
50|$|Today, laser {{photocoagulation}} remains mostly effective, but {{the optimal}} treatment of macular telangiectasia type 1 is questioned, and larger series comparing different treatment modalities seem warranted.

25|$|The role {{of these}} enzymes in {{programmed}} cell death was first identified in 1993, with their functions in apoptosis well characterised. This {{is a form of}} {{programmed cell death}}, occurring widely during development, and throughout life to maintain cell homeostasis. Activation of Caspases ensures that the cellular components are degraded <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>manner,</b> carrying out cell death with minimal effect on surrounding tissues.|$|E
25|$|Sensitivity to {{the data}} {{distribution}} {{can be used to}} an advantage. For example, scaled correlation is designed to use the sensitivity to the range in order to pick out correlations between fast components of time series. By reducing the range of values <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>manner,</b> the correlations on long time scale are filtered out and only the correlations on short time scales are revealed.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} that {{implementation}} planning exercises {{may not be as}} helpful for long-term, self-initiated goals as for short-term, assigned goals. Two studies used the personal goal paradigm to explore the impact of implementation plans on goal progress over time. Study 1 examined whether administering implementation plans <b>in</b> <b>an</b> autonomy supportive manner would facilitate goal progress relative to <b>a</b> neutral, <b>control</b> condition and <b>a</b> condition <b>in</b> which implementation plans were administered <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>manner.</b> Study 2 examined whether combining implementation plans with a self-efficacy boosting exercise would facilitate goal progress relative to <b>a</b> neutral, <b>control</b> condition and <b>a</b> typical implementation condition. The results showed that implementation plans alone did not result in greater goal progress than a neutral condition but that the combination of implementation plans with either autonomy support or self-efficacy boostin...|$|R

25|$|Many Loyalists {{realized}} that independence {{was bound to}} come eventually, but they were fearful that revolution might lead to anarchy, tyranny or mob rule. In contrast, the prevailing attitude among Patriots, who made systematic efforts to use mob violence <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>manner,</b> was a desire to seize the initiative. Labaree also wrote that Loyalists were pessimists who lacked the confidence in the future displayed by the Patriots.|$|E
25|$|Arguably {{the first}} {{chemical}} reaction used <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>manner</b> was fire. However, for millennia fire was seen {{simply as a}} mystical force that could transform one substance into another (burning wood, or boiling water) while producing heat and light. Fire affected many aspects of early societies. These ranged from the simplest facets of everyday life, such as cooking and habitat lighting, to more advanced technologies, such as pottery, bricks, and melting of metals to make tools.|$|E
25|$|Atom probe {{samples are}} shaped to implicitly provide a highly curved {{electric}} potential to induce the resultant magnification, {{as opposed to}} direct use of lensing, such as via magnetic lenses. Furthermore, in normal operation (as opposed to a field ionization modes) the atom probe does not utilize a secondary source to probe the sample. Rather, the sample is evaporated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>manner</b> (field evaporation) and the evaporated ions are impacted onto a detector, which is typically 10 to 100cm away.|$|E

25|$|Virtual Reality Immersion Therapy or VRIT is {{a method}} using {{specially}} encoded virtual environments and computers to evaluate and treat anxiety disorders such as acrophobia or PTSD. Conceived in the early 1990s by Dr. Ralph Lamson, VRIT was clinically proven and the key patent 6,425,764 was filed in 1997 for this major contribution to treatment of medical conditions involving sensory induced disorders by recreating such sensations <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>manner</b> in an immersive virtual environment with feedback to achieve mastery over the causative sensations.|$|E
25|$|Natives of North America began {{practicing}} farming approximately 4,000 years ago, {{late in the}} Archaic {{period of}} North American cultures. Technology had advanced {{to the point that}} pottery was becoming common and the small-scale felling of trees had become feasible. Concurrently, the Archaic Indians began using fire <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>manner.</b> Intentional burning of vegetation was used to mimic the effects of natural fires that tended to clear forest understories. It made travel easier and facilitated the growth of herbs and berry-producing plants, which were important for both food and medicines.|$|E
25|$|Some rinks use harness {{systems to}} help skaters learn new jumps <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>manner.</b> The ice rink {{installs}} a heavy-duty cable that is securely attached to two {{walls of the}} rink. A set of pulleys ride on the cable. The skater wears a vest or belt that has a cable or rope attached to it. That cable/rope is threaded through the movable pulley on the cable above. The coach holds {{the other end of}} the cable and lifts the skater by pulling the cable/rope. The skater can then practice the jump with the coach assisting the completion.|$|E
