40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to obtain a wideband feeding system compatible with compact wideband antenna geometries with dual polarization properties. These feeding systems are designed according to the antenna performance and their structural nature. Therefore we were encountered with two main problems: first of all investigating new balun configurations which can operate in wideband frequency. In other words, we had to achieve balun configurations presenting good impedance and fields matching in wide frequency bandwidth. Moreover, {{the aim of this}} balun design was to arrive to an integrated structure embracing these two properties- wideband characteristic and dual polarization properties. The second problem was to propose and develop wideband antenna architectures with compact form and conformal design. Also it was desired to have dual polarization abilities. In the designing procedure the main obstacle was that configurations <b>embracing</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> properties were rarely proposed in academic researches. In other words in the literature, it was presented rarely an integrated wideband balun connected to compact dual polarized antennas. In this thesis two types of wideband feeding systems are proposed and developed...|$|R
40|$|Existing {{methods for}} dealing with {{knowledge}} updates differ greatly depending on the underlying knowledge representation formalism. When Classical Logic is used, update operators are typically based on manipulating the knowledge base on the model-theoretic level. On {{the opposite side of}} the spectrum stand the semantics for updating Answer-Set Programs where most approaches need to rely on rule syntax. Yet, a unifying perspective that could <b>embrace</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> approaches is of great importance as it enables a deeper understanding of all involved methods and principles and creates room for their cross-fertilisation, ripening and further development. This paper bridges these seemingly irreconcilable approaches to updates. It introduces a novel monotonic characterisation of rules, dubbed RE-models, and shows it to be a more suitable semantic foundation for rule updates than SE-models. A generic framework for defining semantic rule update operators is then proposed. It is based on the idea of viewing a program as the set of sets of RE-models of its rules; updates are performed by introducing additional interpretations to the sets of RE-models of rules in the original program. It is shown that particular instances of the framework are closely related to both belief update principles and traditional approaches to rule updates and enjoy a range of plausible syntactic as well as semantic properties...|$|E

40|$|States {{have the}} right to {{regulate}} access to biological resources subject to national legislations. Allowing, restricting or prohibiting access, however, requires a balance to avoid contravention of the objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity. The Convention requires that, in regulating access, the measures adopted do not become a hindrance to access. In many instances, however, this has been the case. Overreaction to previous cases of bio-piracy and over-enthusiasm to tap into the benefits from discovered genetic resources have caused many provider countries to either over-regulate or extremely complicate access procedures, thus deterring access. In some instances, over-regulation and complex procedures are to be blamed on the users’ reluctance to collaborate with providers in minimising or eliminating abuse. Also, the need to protect certain rights over genetic resources or of an intellectual (property) character, for example, might at times complicate regulation. While it is appreciated that such issues must also be taken into account in addressing and creating a balance in access and benefit sharing, a discussion <b>embracing</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> aspects cannot be captured within the ambit of this article.

40|$|Fieldwork {{carried out}} in the Tirunelvell District of Tamil Nadu, South India, has led to the {{delineation}} of a 'micro-region’ of three agricultural villages This micro-region acquires its sociological unity by virtue of a system of inter-caste relationships and prestations which <b>embraces</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> villages and which manifests itself equally in the religious, economic, political and administrative spheres. In particular, the various specialist caste-groups perform their respective services for clienteles made-up of {{all or part of the}} population of the micro-region concerned. One aspect of each specialist's duty is his role in the life-crisis rituals of his clients. These rituals are themselves subsequently re-examined from the opposite perspective, namely with reference to the intra-caste relationships which they bring into play. Particular attention is paid to female puberty rites and to marriage; these are considered as a single ritual complex, concerned with caste purity and the legitimation of off-spring. The phenomenon of marriage between a man and his elder sister’s daughter is examined. There is a discussion of the problems which this practice raises for the conventional view of the 'Dravidian' marriage system, and an alternative structure is suggested for the kinship terminology in the present case. It is argued throughout that the problems being considered are best approached from a sociological, structural perspective, and a three-level model of social reality is adapted for this purpose. As a complement to this, the study concludes with a critique of the recently-advanced 'cultural' and 'ethnosociological' approaches in South Asian anthropology...|$|R

Important risk management issues include store design and environmental controls, conditioning and packaging, package handling and cranes, operation, monitoring of waste packages, package retrieval, external environmental factors, stakeholder issues and costs. <b>All</b> of <b>these</b> issues will need to be addressed during the design, construction and operation of an ILW store.

By varying the weighting of the different attributes, the sensitivity of the overall score of the various designs to their attributes may be evaluated. Ultimately, the technical issues related to store design, construction and operation will have to be balanced against the non-technical factors that may influence the development of a store, particularly those related to stakeholder interactions and public concerns.

40|$|M. A. A {{number of}} recent {{variables}} have influenced the professionalisation {{of the child and}} youth care discipline in South Africa. These variables have had a direct impact on the training of child and youth care practitioners. The first variable is the establishment of the National Qualifications Framework, the National Qualification Authority and the focus on lifelong learning possibilities as well as competency-based training. The second variable is the establishment of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Young People at Risk (IMC) and the accompanying transformation of the South African child and youth care system. The third variable is the transformation of the Interim Council for Social Work with the associated recognition of Child and Youth Care as an independent discipline. The fourth variable is the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child by South Africa in 1995 in which certain rights of children are recognised. The fifth variable is the knowledge that South African children have special protection under the South African Constitution. The sixth variable is the Africanisation of the profession in South Africa. These variables have stressed the importance of compiling a competency-based framework for the training of child and youth care practitioners in South Africa that <b>embraces</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> variables. Child and Youth Care is a phenomenon that is quite unfamiliar as an independent discipline in South Africa, and therefore the researcher chose a qualitative paradigm that is exploratory, descriptive, contextual and phenomenological to develop a competency-based framework for the training of Child and Youth Care practitioners in South Africa. The empirical research included phenomenological interviews with child and youth care trainers and a focus group interview with child and youth care practitioners. Literature was consulted in two stages, namely at the beginning to pose the problem and {{at the conclusion of the}} research to compare and contrast the findings (Cresswell, 1994 : 24). The four criteria to ensure trustworthiness are credibility, transferability, dependability and confirmability. The criteria to obtain this included the triangulation of various methods of data collection and by confirming results with respondents. Detailed descriptions were done to enhance the study's chance of being replicated in another setting. The services of an external coder were utilised.

Even in the early 1980 s when {{literature}} produced by African-American women was gaining prominence among general readers and drawing the attention of critics, Marshall was still {{considered to be an}} enigmatic literary figure, somehow important in the canon but not one of its trend setters. As Mary Helen Washington observed in an influential afterword to Brown Girl, Brownstones, although Marshall had been publishing novels and short stories since the early 1950 s, and was indeed the key link between African-American writers of the 1940 s and those of the 1960 s, she was just being "discovered" in the 1980 s. While {{there has always been a}} small group of scholars, most notably Kamau Brathwaite, who have called attention to the indispensable role Marshall has played in the shaping of the literary canon of the African Diaspora, and of her profound understanding of the issues that have affected the complex formation and survival of African-derived cultures in the New World, many critics have found it difficult to locate her within the American, African-American, and Caribbean traditions that are the sources of her imagination and the subject of her major works. Marshall has <b>embraced</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> cultures in more profound ways than her more famous contemporaries have, but she has not gotten the accolades that have gone to lesser writers like Alice Walker. It is indeed one of the greatest injustices of our time that Walker's limited understanding of the cultures and peoples of the African Diaspora has become the point of reference for North American scholars of Africa, the Caribbean, and South America while Marshall's scholastic engagement with questions of Diaspora has not drawn the same kind of interest...|$|R

40|$|Literature {{encompassing}} Sustainable Leadership {{and developing}} leaders sustainably {{are still in}} infancy (Lambert, 2011). Nevertheless indications identify leadership as a vital cog in achieving sustainable organisations. Sustainable leadership can allow a fast, resilient response which is competitive and appealing to all stakeholders (Avery and Bergsteiner, 2011). Arguably, organisations’ need to stop considering leadership as a control function (Casserley and Critchley, 2010; Crews, 2010) and instead focus on dialogue and mutual-interdependency between leaders and their followers (Barrand Dowding, 2012). This paper aims to explore and analyse the concept of sustainable leadership to present a conceptual framework surrounding sustainable leadership. Design/methodology/approachThis conceptual paper will review the existing frameworks of sustainable leadership and present a conceptualisation of the frameworks. This conceptualisation synthesises frameworks and literature surrounding the concept of sustainable leadership which involves work from seminal authors Casserley and Critchley (2010),Avery and Bergsteiner (2011), Hargreaves and Fink (2006), Davies (2009) and Lambert (2011). Seminal themes from the synthesised frameworks are presented to explore and unify the conceptualisation of sustainable leadership. FindingsWithin leadership literature, stakeholder approaches (Groves and LaRocca, 2011; Avery and Bergsteiner, 2011 a); discourses underlining the importance of relationship between leaders and followers (Barr and Dowding, 2012); and discussions about theneed to develop reflexive and participative leadership models (Kopp and Martinuzzi, 2013) have become prominent. Sustainable leadership <b>embraces</b> <b>all</b> of <b>these</b> new components. The concept advocates organisations should shift emphasis from a traditional singular focus on finances, to a view that organisations are contributors to wider environmental and social influences (Crews, 2010; Avery and Bergsteiner, 2011 a).
