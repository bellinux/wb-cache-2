500|$|Fralic also {{described}} the character as being [...] "quixotic", who is [...] "deeply layered with arrogance and angst, imbued {{with all the}} failings and bravado that a true villain possesses, his dastardly deeds leaving him most recently responsible {{not only for the}} death of his own heart donor, but for the near-death of his granddaughter Summer from peanut poisoning". She also noted that he's been jailed, thrown in a psychiatric ward and shot, had amnesia, epilepsy among other events, but [...] "like all villains worth their salt, he's survived it all and inspired respect, if not adoration". Braeden describes the character as [...] "the villain" [...] and as [...] "defensive and always self-protective", stating that he's [...] "not here to win a popularity contest". He stated that he enjoys portraying Victor [...] "more than anything", also describing him as [...] "very complex". Braeden said that [...] "he fought himself to the position he arrived at a number of years ago", and that [...] "he obviously doesn't suffer fools easily, doesn't suffer enemies easily. He wants relationships badly, but doesn't quite trust them. It's a tragic flaw in him because of his childhood." [...] The actor, comparing himself to the character, noted that he is nothing like Victor, stating: [...] "Money makes a lot of things happen for Victor. My God almighty, that's something else that I, Eric Braeden, would never do. I always confront things directly. But when that doesn't work for Victor, <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>out</b> his wallet [...] If you are abusive to him, he will be abusive to you. No one gets away with that. I will not allow anyone to cross that line with the character." ...|$|E
500|$|Harrison Ford reprises {{the role}} of Dr. Henry [...] "Indiana" [...] Jones, Jr. To prepare for the role, the 64-year-old Ford spent {{three hours a day}} at a gym, practiced with the bullwhip for two weeks, and relied on a high-protein diet of fish and vegetables. Ford had kept fit during the series' hiatus anyway, as he hoped for another film. He {{performed}} many of his own stunts because stunt technology had become safer since 1989, and he also felt it improved his performance. It is also said that he still fit into his pants from Raiders of the Lost Ark. He argued, [...] "The appeal of Indiana Jones isn't his youth but his imagination, his resourcefulness. His physicality {{is a big part of}} it, especially the way <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>out</b> of tight situations. But it's not all hitting people and falling from high places. My ambition in action is to have the audience look straight in the face of character and not at the back of a capable stuntman's head. I hope to continue that no matter how old I get." [...] Ford felt his return would reduce U.S. ageism (he refused to dye his hair for the role), because of the film's family appeal: [...] "This is a movie which is geared not to [...] segment of the demographic, an age-defined segment ... We've got a great shot at breaking the movie demographic constraints." [...] He told Koepp to add more references to his age in the script. Spielberg said Ford was not too old to play Indiana: [...] "When a guy gets to be that age and he still packs the same punch, and he still runs just as fast and climbs just as high, he's gonna be breathing a little heavier at the end of the set piece. And I felt, 'Let's have some fun with that. Let's not hide that. Spielberg recalled the line in Raiders that said, [...] "It's not the years, it's the mileage," [...] and felt he could not tell the difference between Ford during the shoots for Last Crusade and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.|$|E
