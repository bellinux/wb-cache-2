5|$|Goronwy ap Tudur <b>Hen</b> was one {{of three}} sons of Welsh noble Tudur <b>Hen</b> (English: Tudur the Elder) and Anghared fil Ithel Fychan, {{alongside}} Madog ap Tudur <b>Hen</b> and Hywel ap Tudur <b>Hen.</b> Tudor <b>Hen</b> had first been in service to Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (also known as Llywelyn the Last), the King of Gwynedd, but retained his titles under the conquest of Wales by King Edward I of England. But during the rebellion of Madog ap Llywelyn, Tudur acted as his steward. After the rebellion failed, Tudur pledged his loyalty to Edward. Utilising the more advantageous property laws of England, Tudur saw to it that his lands were passed seamlessly upon his death in 1311 into the hands of Goronwy.|$|E
5|$|Characteristically, Sebrights {{are only}} {{one of a few}} chicken breeds in which the roosters are <b>hen</b> feathered, meaning they have none of the long, sickleshaped {{feathers}} common in most roosters that appear in the tail, neck and saddle. Due to the unique characteristic <b>hen</b> feathering, molecular biologists have found the Sebright bantam a useful model organism in the study of sex hormones. This is because they carry a mutation that causes the tissues of their skin to convert an unusually large amount of male sex hormones (androgens) into female sex hormones (estrogens).|$|E

5|$|Goronwy's {{eldest son}} Hywel ap Goronwy joined the priesthood, {{and became a}} canon of Bangor Cathedral. In 1357, Hywel became the Archdeacon of Anglesey. Gruffydd drowned in 1344. Goronwy ap Tudur <b>Hen</b> {{was one of the}} direct {{ancestors}} of the Royal House of Tudor. His son Tudur ap Goronwy became a knight in the service of Edward III, and was the grandfather of Owain ap Maredudd ap Tudur (through his son Maredudd ap Tudur, grandson to Goronwy ap Tudur <b>Hen).</b> Owain Anglicised his name, becoming Owen Tudor, and was himself the grandfather of King Henry VII of England, the founder of the House of Tudor.|$|E
5|$|He {{acted as}} an {{official}} representative for the English Royal Family in the Perfeddwlad territories. Tudur used the English property laws, which he found more advantageous in his position than those used by the Welsh, as they allowed for inheritance of lands by a single party. He continued to hold the lands in North Wales and Cardiganshire which he had inherited. Upon his death in 1311, his holdings passed to his son Goronwy ap Tudur <b>Hen.</b> He had two further sons, Madog and Hywel. Tudur <b>Hen</b> was interned in Bangor Priory on 11 October 1311; his son, Goronwy, was also placed there on 11 December 1331 following his death.|$|E
5|$|The <b>hen</b> flea (Ceratophyllus gallinae) is {{the most}} common flea in their nests. The small, pale house-sparrow flea C. fringillae, is also {{occasionally}} found there and probably arises from the habit of its main host of taking over the nests of other species. This flea does not occur in the US, even on house sparrows. Lice include Menacanthus eurystemus, Brueelia nebulosa and Stumidoecus sturni. Other arthropod parasites include Ixodes ticks and mites such as Analgopsis passerinus, Boydaia stumi, Dermanyssus gallinae, Ornithonyssus bursa, O. sylviarum, Proctophyllodes species, Pteronyssoides truncatus and Trouessartia rosteri. The <b>hen</b> mite D. gallinae is itself preyed upon by the predatory mite Androlaelaps casalis. The presence of this control on numbers of the parasitic species may explain why birds are prepared to reuse old nests.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{total of}} 564 plasma samples was {{collected}} from Leghorn <b>hens</b> {{to determine if}} inorganic phosphate, calcium, and magnesium concentrations differed in birds which had just laid soft-shelled (SS) or shell-less (SL) eggs when compared to control <b>hens.</b> Four groups, 141 observa-tions per group, were used. Group 1 consisted of <b>hens</b> which had just laid SS or SL eggs. Group 2 contained <b>hens</b> with SS or SL eggs in their uteri. Group 3 consisted of <b>hens</b> with hard-shelled (HS) eggs in their uteri. Group 4 represented those <b>hens</b> which had just laid HS eggs. In general, a lower concentration of plasma calcium and magnesium was found in <b>hens</b> which laid either SS/SL or HS eggs (Groups 1 and 4, respectively) when compared to <b>hens</b> with SS/SL or HS eggs in their uteri (Groups 2 and 3, respectively). Likewise, a lower concentration of plasma inorganic phosphate was observed in <b>hens</b> which laid HS eggs (Group 4) when compared to <b>hens</b> with HS eggs in their uteri (Group 3). However, a greater concentration of plasma phosphate was found in <b>hens</b> which laid SS/SL eggs (Group 1) when compared to <b>hens</b> with SS/SL eggs in their uteri (Group 2). It is concluded that <b>hens</b> which laid SS/SL eggs had plasma calcium and magnesium concentra-tions comparable to <b>hens</b> which produced HS eggs. However, birds which laid SS/SL eggs had higher plasma phosphate levels than those which laid HS eggs...|$|R
40|$|Feed {{withdrawal}} {{is commonly}} used by commercial egg producers to induce molt and stimulate multiple egg-laying cycles in their flocks. However, the practice can compromise {{the welfare of the}} birds by elevating stress, suppressing the immune response and causing abnormal behavior. An alternate molt diet was examined using alfalfa diets, and a series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the physiological, immunological and behavioral responses of laying <b>hens</b> fed these diets. We assessed the changes in the levels of blood plasma metabolites after <b>hens</b> were challenged with 106 colony forming units of Salmonella Enteritidis (SE). <b>Hens</b> fed alfalfa diets displayed similar (P ? 0. 05) levels of cholesterol, glucose, and total protein when compared to full-fed <b>hens.</b> Reduced levels (P ? 0. 05) of triglycerides were observed in the alfalfa fed and feed withdrawal <b>hens</b> when compared to the full-fed <b>hens.</b> The immune responses of SE challenged laying <b>hens</b> fed alfalfa diets showed similar (P ? 0. 05) heterophil to lymphocyte ratios (H: L) to full-fed <b>hens</b> whereas the feed withdrawal <b>hens</b> displayed elevated (P ? 0. 05) H: L ratios. The feed withdrawal <b>hens</b> displayed reduced (P ? 0. 05) levels of serum IgY early in the trial when compared to the alfalfa and full-fed <b>hens.</b> The alfalfa fed <b>hens</b> displayed lower levels of acid ? glycol protein than the feed withdrawal <b>hens</b> and higher levels than the full-fed early during the trial but returned to levels that were similar (P ? 0. 05) to the full-fed <b>hens.</b> The <b>hens</b> fed alfalfa diets displayed elevated non-nutritive pecking behavior early in the trial however, this behavior declined to levels similar (P ? 0. 05) to the full-fed <b>hens</b> {{by the end of the}} trial. No differences in aggressive behavior were observed between the alfalfa fed <b>hens</b> and the full-fed <b>hens.</b> Hafnium chloride did not effectively mark the alfalfa diet; however, it can be used to track the passage of corn-soy layer ration. This research suggests that the application of alfalfa as an alternative molt diet can be effective in reducing potentially harmful effects which are usually associated with feed withdrawal...|$|R

5|$|With the {{exception}} of the Neolithic settlement at Cefn Glas, there are three certain pre-Medieval settlement sites in the valley — Maendy Camp, <b>Hen</b> Dre'r Gelli and <b>Hen</b> Dre'r Mynydd. The earliest of these structures is Maendy Camp, a hillfort whose remains are situated between Ton Pentre and Cwmparc. Although its defences would have been slight, the camp made good use of the natural slopes and rock outcrops to its north-east face. Maendy camp consisted of two earthworks, an inner and outer enclosure. When the site was excavated in 1901 several archaeological finds led to the camp being misidentified as Bronze Age. These finds, mainly pottery and flint knives, were excavated from a burial cairn discovered within the outer enclosure but the site has since been classified as from the Iron Age.|$|E
5|$|Goronwy ap Tudur <b>Hen</b> was Lord of Penmynydd and {{a soldier}} {{in the service of the}} English crown. He joined King Edward II of England for his {{invasion}} of Scotland in 1314 as part of the First War of Scottish Independence, which included service at the Battle of Bannockburn in June of that year. In 1316, a rebellion took place in Glamorgan under the leadership of Llywelyn Bren, at the same time Edward was campaigning in Scotland. Despite this there was little concern that it would spread to North Wales, with the royal officials instead concerned with the threat of invasion from Ireland. Some 1,500 troops were summoned from the area to support the King, and among those leading those troops were Iorweth ap Gruffudd, Gruffudd Llwyd and his cousin Goronwy ap Tudur <b>Hen.</b> After these troops, under the command of Gruffudd Llwyd, moved to Chester, they were dismissed on 4 August 1316 to return to North Wales in order to protect the area from the Irish threat.|$|E

In contrast, rats persist on <b>Hen</b> Island of the same group, and no juvenile tuatara had been seen there as of 2001. In the Alderman Islands, Middle Chain Island holds no tuatara, but it is considered possible for rats to swim between Middle Chain and other islands that do hold tuatara, and the rats were eradicated in 1992 to prevent this.
