The research aimed to find how to <b>decide</b> broad slice between sector and room structure according to its affinity axis line equation. <b>Deciding</b> slice broad between sector and room structure could be found by using triangle broad, when the slice structure shaped was a other structure beside triangle, the broad could be found by dividing the slice structure into several triangle. Steps in <b>deciding</b> slice broad and room structure according to affinity axis line were: (1) each points of room structure corner <b>decided</b> in room coordinate, then <b>decided</b> the affinity axis line equation; (2) <b>deciding</b> points coordinate divided line with certain composition; (3) <b>deciding</b> room equation through three points; (4) <b>deciding</b> line equation through two points; (5) <b>deciding</b> slicing point coordinate between line and sector; (6) <b>deciding</b> slice broad using triangle broad...|$|R
