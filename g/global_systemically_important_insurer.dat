40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} systemic risk in insurance and investigates how financial markets evaluate {{the introduction of a}} new regulation addressed to <b>global</b> <b>systemically</b> <b>important</b> <b>insurers</b> (G-SIIs). We analysed the stock price reactions and the evolution of the distance-to-default of a sample of 44 of the world's largest insurers to the publication of the first list of 9 G-SIIs and the release of information regarding their new capital requirements and other policy measures. The results of our event study suggest that, overall, investors doubt the effectiveness of the new regulatory framework in reducing systemic risk in the insurance sector and curbing the moral hazard implications of a “too systemic to fail” policy...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} IAIS Global Seminar in June 2017, IAIS {{disclosed}} {{the agenda for}} a gradual shift in the systemic risk assessment methodology from the current Entity Based Approach (EBA) to a new Activity Based Approach(ABA). The EBA, which {{was developed in the}} aftermath of the 2008 / 2009 financial crisis, defines a list of <b>Global</b> <b>Systemically</b> <b>Important</b> <b>Insurers</b> (G-SIIs) based on a pre-defined set of criteria related to the size of the institution. These G-SIIs are subject to additional regulatory requirements since their distress or disorderly failure would potentially cause significant disruption to the global financial system and economic activity. Even if size is still a needed element of a systemic risk assessment, the strong emphasis put on the too-big-to-fail approach in insurance, i. e. EBA, might be partially missing the underlying nature of systemic risk in insurance. Not only certain activities, including insurance activities such as life or non-life lines of business, but also common exposures or certain managerial practices such as leverage or funding structures, tend to contribute to systemic risk of insurers but are not covered by the current EBA (Berdin and Sottocornola, 2015). Therefore, we very much welcome the general development of the systemic risk assessment methodology, even if several important questions still need to be answered...|$|R

40|$|A {{sovereign}} debt crisis can have significant knock-on {{effects in the}} financial markets and put financial stability at risk. This paper focuses on the transmission of sovereign risk to insurance companies as some of the largest institutional investors in the sovereign bond market. We use a firm level panel dataset that covers large insurance companies, banks and non-financial firms from nine countries in the time period January 1 st 2008 to May 1 st 2013. We find significant and robust transmission effects from sovereign risk to domestic insurers. The impact on insurers is larger than for non-financial firms and slightly smaller than for banks. We find that <b>systemically</b> <b>important</b> <b>insurers</b> were more closely linked to the domestic sovereign. Based on European data, we show that risks in sovereign bond portfolios are an <b>important</b> driver of <b>insurer</b> risk, which is not reflected in current insurance regulation (incl. upcoming Solvency II in Europe) ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to {{determine}} the optimal size of the system (global, supranational or national) when measuring the systemic importance of a bank. Since 2011, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) has tagged <b>global</b> <b>systemically</b> <b>important</b> banks (G-SIBs) and has imposed a higher regulatory capital of loss absorbency (HLA) requirement. However, the identification of G-SIBs may overlook banks with major domestic systemic importance, i. e. the domestic <b>systemically</b> <b>important</b> banks (D-SIBs). This paper describes how to adjust market-based systemic risk measures to identify D-SIBs. In an empirical analysis within the eurozone, I show that (i) the SRISK methodology produces similar rankings whatever the system used. However, (ii) the SRISK values greatly vary across systems, which calls for imposing the higher of either D-SIB or G-SIB HLA requirements. Finally, (iii) the ΔCoVaR methodology is extremely sensitive to the choice of the system...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} three {{empirical studies}} regarding information content of {{credit default swap}} (CDS). The first study provides further evidence of credit risk discovery between CDS and stock of the U. S. non-financial firms. Stock generally leads CDS in discovering credit risk information, {{with the exception of}} the stressful financial crisis period of 2008 – 2010. The CDS of investment-grade firms generally possesses higher informational efficiency than that of speculative-grade firms. High funding cost and central clearing counterparty hinder CDS from rapidly incorporating credit risk news. The second study investigates dynamics and determinates of credit risk transmission across the <b>global</b> <b>systemically</b> <b>important</b> financial institutions (G-SIFIs).

40|$|We {{study the}} joint credit {{risk in the}} UK banking sector using the weekly CDS spreads of <b>global</b> <b>systemically</b> <b>important</b> banks over 2007 - 2015. We show that the {{time-varying}} and asymmetric dependence structure of the CDS spread changes {{is closely related to}} the joint default probability that two or more banks simultaneously default. We are able to flexibly measure the joint credit risk at the high-frequency level by applying the combination of the reduced-form model and the GAS-based dynamic asymmetric copula model to the CDS spreads. We also verify that much of the dependence structure of the CDS spread changes are driven by the market factors. Overall, our study demonstrates that the market factors are key inputs for the effective management of the systemic credit risk in the banking sector...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{specific features}} of establishment of new regulatory standards of <b>systemically</b> <b>important</b> banks {{as one of}} the most priority directions of post-crisis improvement of supranational financial regulation. The essense of active and prearranged initiatives to secure constant activity of global and domestic powerful super-big banking institutions is investigated as well as some approaches as to recovery measures implementation without involvement of taxpayers' funds in case of their financial failure are considered. In particular, the main points are focused on introduction of additional requirements to the sufficiency of capital of <b>global</b> <b>systemically</b> <b>important</b> banks, development of the regulatory mechanisms of domestic <b>systemically</b> <b>important</b> banks by domestic authorities taking into account the specific peculiarities of certain national economies, structural reforms as to separation of traditional banking from the securities transactions for the depositors protection (Volcker rule, USA; Vickers rule, UK), establishment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism for the Eurozone banks, and declaration of necessity to form the Single mechanism for bank bankruptcy resolution etc. Some proposals concerning transformation of domestic system of financial regulation and supervision in Ukraine, like strengthening control of <b>systemically</b> <b>important</b> banks activity and introduction of mega-regulator model are characterized...|$|R
40|$|To {{address the}} {{challenges}} posed by <b>global</b> <b>systemically</b> <b>important</b> banks (G-SIBs), the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision recommended an "additional loss absorbency requirement" for these institutions. Along these lines, I develop a microfounded design of capital surcharges that target the interconnectedness component of systemic risk. These surcharges increase {{the costs of}} establishing interbank connections, {{which leads to a}} non-monotonic welfare effect. While reduced interconnectedness decreases welfare by restricting the ability of banks to insure against liquidity shocks, it also increases it by reducing contagion when an interconnected bank fails. Thus, the regulator faces a trade-off between efficiency and financial stability. Furthermore, I show that capital requirements are more effective than default fund contributions when tail-risk exposure is the private information of banks. I conclude by analyzing how resolution regimes and stable funding requirements interact with these surcharges...|$|R

40|$|A central {{challenge}} for international financial regulatory systems today {{is how to}} manage the impact of <b>global</b> <b>systemically</b> <b>important</b> financial institutions (G-SIFIs) on the global economy, given the interconnected and pluralistic nature of regulatory regimes. This paper focuses on the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and proposes a new research agenda for the FSB’s emerging regulatory forms. In particular, it examines the regulatory architecture of the New Governance (NG), a variety of approaches {{that are supposed to}} be more reflexive, collaborative, and experimental than traditional forms of governance. A preliminary conclusion is that NG tools may be effective in resolving some kinds of problems in a pluralistic regulatory order, but they are unlikely to be suitable for all problems. As such, this article proposes that analyses of the precise conditions in which NG mechanisms {{may or may not be}} effective are necessary. It concludes with some recommendations for improving the NG model...|$|R
40|$|We {{provide an}} {{empirical}} {{assessment of the}} suggestion, based on Severo (2012), to use a systemic liquidity risk index (SLRI) for estimating liquidity premia that could be charged on large banks as a compensation for the implicit liquidity support obtained from public authorities (Blancher et al., 2013). To this end we compute, over the period January 2004 –December 2012, a parsimonious and fully documented SLRI. We also investigate its statistical significance in explaining the level and variability of stock returns {{for a group of}} large international banks across the subprime and the Eurozone sovereign debt crises. Main findings are two: our more parsimonious SLRI is close to Severo’s but provides a stronger signal of liquidity stress and recovery episodes; we consistently fail to detect, within and across the two crises, a stable group of banks among the <b>global</b> <b>systemically</b> <b>important</b> ones listed by the Financial Stability Board...|$|R
40|$|Most postcrisis {{financial}} regulation is expressed {{to be in}} the pursuit of increasing the resilience of the global financial system. “Resilience” features in the formal title of the Basel III reforms to bank capital adequacy rules. This article explores the meaning of resilience from social-ecological systems science and applies it to international finance. We conclude that postcrisis {{financial regulation}} has in fact sought to build a stronger, more robust system, not a more resilient one. The regulation imposed on <b>global</b> <b>systemically</b> <b>important</b> financial institutions is designed to make these institutions too strong to fail, not give them the capacity to reorganize themselves, or transition to a new equilibrium, in the face of major external shocks. This article challenges the fundamental thinking behind seven years of postcrisis financial regulation and suggests we need far more rigorous research into what a truly resilient international financial system would look like and how it would be regulated...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{looks at}} <b>Global</b> <b>Systemically</b> <b>Important</b> Financial Institutions (GSIFIs) {{and the global}} {{derivatives}} business. The derivatives business has grown exponentially versus global GDP {{in sharp contrast to}} the primary securities on which derivatives are based. Inter-connectedness risk and unconstrained potential leverage remain the most urgent tasks still facing the financial reform process. Concentrated oligopolistic derivatives markets and the ability of banks to shift promises and/or use their IRB models to estimate ex-ante risk capital – capital that might be needed in the event of a crisis – undermine the intent of financial reform. Nor do netting and clearing eliminate aggregate risk of losses and bankruptcy. The paper repeats the need to implement two of the OECD’s long-standing reform recommendations: a binding leverage ratio based on equity and the separation of high risk investment banking activities from traditional banking. A derivatives transactions tax is also put forward as a possible option that would counter the cross-subsidisation of risk from the too-big-to-fail (TBTF) problem. ...|$|R

40|$|This study employs bank-level {{data for}} a global sample to examine the {{relationship}} between capital and profitability over 2000 - 2013. Our evidence suggests that bank capital is positively related to bank profitability, although the estimated impact is relatively marginal. However, more capitalised banks that are more profitable appear to have a higher traditional risk, a greater proportion of non-traditional activities in their balance sheets and they tend to be more effective at controlling their costs. The relationship depends on environmental conditions as well and bank size. It is typically stronger in crisis periods, in lower and middle income countries and for larger banks (but not for <b>Global</b> <b>Systemically</b> <b>Important</b> Banks, or GSIBs). Finally, for banks operating in less restricted, more unstable and corrupt environments, the same increase in capital is associated with more profitable institutions than banks operating in countries with lower corruption levels. Our findings are robust to different specifications and robustness tests, and carry important implications for policy reforms aimed at ensuring stability to the banking sector globally...|$|R

40|$|The {{state-based}} {{model of}} U. S. insurance regulation has been remarkably enduring to date, {{in part because}} the traditional rationales for a greater federal role – efficiency, uniformity, and consumer protection – have not succeeded in displacing it. However, the 2008 financial crisis, the federal government’s unprecedented bailouts of parts of the insurance sector, and the need for a coordinated international approach radically shifted the debate about the proper allocation of power between {{the federal government and the}} states by supplanting traditional concerns about efficiency, uniformity, and consumer protection in insurance with a new federal mission to control systemic risk. Unprepared and ill-equipped to counter this shift, the states face the biggest threat to their domination of U. S. insurance regulation in years. Already, the federal government has made inroads into insurance regulation for purposes of systemic risk oversight. That federal presence creates several openings for a broader federal role in insurance than just regulation of <b>systemically</b> <b>important</b> <b>insurers.</b> For instance, solvency regulation, which traditionally has been reserved to the states, increasingly could be subsumed under the rubric of systemic risk. Over time, other types of federal incursions could include higher reporting requirements for insurers, regulation of discrete, systemically risky activities (regardless of an insurer’s size), oversight of captive reinsurers, and greater consolidated supervision of insurance groups...|$|R
