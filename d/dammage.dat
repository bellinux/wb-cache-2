40|$|Lipid peroxidation is {{a general}} {{phenomenon}} which takes place in foods {{as well as in}} cellular membranes and lipoproteins. It leads to oxidative <b>dammages</b> with consequences to food preservation and to the development of various diseases. The targets of lipid oxidation are the polyunsaturated fatty acids. Owing to the fact that oxygen can exist under 2 states, a ground state (3 O 2) and an excited state (1 O 2), lipid peroxidation can proceed by 2 different reactions. One which involves (3 O 2), is a free-radical chain reaction with 3 steps (initiation by free radicals, propagation and terminaison), the other which involves (1 O 2) is a fast reaction with direct addition of oxygen to the double bonds of fatty acids. Both reactions lead to the formation of hydroperoxides as primary products. Hydroperoxides decomposed rapidly to give many secondary products such as lipid free radicals which contribute to increase the oxidation of other molecules such as proteins, nucleic acids and other lipids. Ketones, alkanes (pentane, ethane) and aldehydes (MDA, 4 HNE) are also formed by hydroperoxide decomposition. Aldehydes are reactive compounds which bind to the amino group of proteins, nucleic acids and lipids causing <b>dammages</b> to these molecules. The consequences for membranes are alterations of their functions which could lead to cell death. In food hydroperoxide decomposition give rise to qualitative alterations. Lipid peroxidation is a major problem for food industry as well as for human health since it is associated to many diseases. Antioxidants can prevent or delay lipid peroxidation by different mechanisms...|$|R

So he goeth to one of his Masters or Dames for what he wanteth, and asks them to help him with such a thing: Yes, say they, you may have it; but withall they will give him a gripe, perhaps make him pay as much (or more) for it at home, as they can get when they have carryed it five miles to a Market, yea and that too for the Refuse of their Commodity.

60|$|But to {{give you}} a more direct answer. This kind of getting, is so far off from doing them little good, that it doth them no good at all; because thereby they lose their own souls; What shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? {113b} He loseth then, he loseth greatly that getteth after this fashion. This is the man that is penny-wise, and pound- foolish; this is he that loseth his good Sheep for a halfpennyworth of tarr; that loseth a soul for a little of the world. And then what doth he get thereby, but loss and <b>dammage?</b> {113c} Thus he getteth, or rather loseth about the world to come: But what doth he get in this world, more than travel and sorrow vexation of spirit, and disappointment? Men aim at blessedness in getting, I mean, at {{temporal}} blessedness; but the man that thus getteth, shall not have that. For though an Inheritance after this manner may be hastily gotten at the beginning, yet the end thereof shall not be blessed. They gather it indeed, and think to keep it too, but what says Solomon?

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{objectives}} of research activities at the Institute of Soil Mechanics and Foundation Engineering of the TU Berlin is the field of geotechnics in environmental engineering. Liner systems {{play a central role}} in landfill construction and remediation of contaminated sites for long-term protection against pollutant transport into the environment. Clayey soils are very common in use as sealing material in the construction of liner systems. An advantageous property of clayey soils is often believed in their property of self-healing with respect to hydraulic conductivity, when <b>dammaged</b> by cracks. In the present publication, which was supported by the BMBF-Integrated Research Programme 'Development of Advanced Landfill Liner Systems' the problem of self-healing is detailed investigated. The presented results allow a better understanding of self-healing conditions in liner systems and provide a helpful basis to geotechnical practice in the construction of liner systems, their quality control and in the valuation of remediation measurements.

40|$|In the {{investigation}} of marine phenomena on a bay or an inshore in where water temperature, salinity and etc. are changing with the tide, an instant sampling water by reversing bottle {{may be able to}} show the only datum on one point at that instant. The datum is not always a typical value in the point. Then, many data by oftentimes sampling are needed to get the average value correctly. The authors projected the appartus to sample sea-water continuously for long time (12 ~ 36 hours) by means of laminar flow in a capillary. When, in Fig. 2, H (cm) is pressure head; l (cm), length of capillary; d (cm), inner diameter of the one; ν (cm^ 2 /s), kinematic viscosity of sea water; Q (cm^ 3 /s), sampled volume; thenQ≒ 25. 1 ×H･d^ 4 /(ν･l) Using d= 0. 050 ~ 0. 125 cm and l= 5 ~ 15 cm, Q (cc/s) against H (cm) is shown in Fig. 1. To sample approx. 500 cc of sea-water per day by d= 0. 05 cm, it is known from this figure that l= 5 ~ 10 cm and H= 3 ~ 7 cm must be used. Under the theoretical condideration, they examined various types of water bottle for the utility of this idea. The results of experiments with (I) -type and(III) -type (in Fig. 3) are shown in Fig. 4 and 5 respectively. It was very difficult to adjust the pressure in the bottle for a regular sampling. Because the apparatus was set up and dowm in rough sea, sea-water had been poured into the bottle through an air out-let (bubbling) pipe. Then, water sampling was <b>dammaged</b> by the contamination of unexpected water. On the purpose of checking the reliability of this apparatus, the calibrating test was carried on with (IV) -type (in Fig. 3) in the sea-water tank (salinity was changed artificially). The result of this test was shown in Fig. 6. The authors finished the experiment of continuous sampling with (V) -type in the tank.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} if {{an energy}} price shock should be compensated by {{a reduction in}} energy taxes to mitigate its impact on consumer prices. Such an adjustment is often debated and advocated for redistributive reasons. Our investigation {{is based on a}} model that characterizes second-best optimal taxes in the presence of an externality generated by energy consumption. Energy is used by households as a consumption good and by the productive sector as an input. We calibrate this model on US data and proceed to simulations of this empirical model. We assume that energy prices are subject to an exogenous shock. For different levels of this shock, we calculate the optimal tax mix including income, commodity and energy taxes. We show that optimal energy taxes are affected by redistributive consideration and that optimal energy tax is less than the Pigouvian tax (marginal social damage). The difference is an implicit subsidy representing roughly 10 % of the Pigouvian price. Interestingly, the simulations show that an variation in the energy price only has an almost negligible effect on this percentage. In other words, even a very large oil price increase will only have a small effect on the optimal tax on energy. Nevertheless, it appears that the energy tax is used to mitigate the impact of the energy shock. However, this result is not explained by redistributive consideration but {{by the fact that the}} Pigouvian tax (rate) decreases as the price of energy increases. This is a purely arithmetic adjustment due to the fact that the marginal social <b>dammage</b> does not change. Consequently, the marginal <b>dammage</b> as a percentage of the energy price (which defines the Pigouvian tax rate) decreases as the price increases. ...|$|E

40|$|In Germany the {{treatment}} of alcohol-related deseases demands several billions euro every year. Like shown {{in a variety of}} studies, surgical stress as well as alcoholism lead to an impairment of the immune system. There is a 2 to 4 fold increase of the amount of postoperative complications seen in alcoholics. Among alcohol abusing patients admitted to the ICU the postoperative pneumonia is the most common postsurgical complication. Chronic exposion to ethanol has been shown to decrease the secreted levels of TNF-α, IL- 1 β and IL- 6 but increase the levels of IL- 10. Surgery itself seemed as well to lead to an immune suppression with decreased levels of TNFα, IL- 1 β, IL- 12 und IFN-γ and increased levels of IL- 10 and IL- 6. A postoperative decreased IL- 6 /IL- 10 -ratio {{has been shown to be}} associated with a higher risk for infections in chronic alcoholics. To evaluate the immunomodulatory influences of surgical stress combined with chronic alcoholism 27 Balb/c mice were treated with Ethanol or Saline intraperitoneally for 8 days followed by a median laparotomy. 48 hours after surgery the mice were either infected with 104 CFU K. pneumoniae or were given NaCl 0, 9 % intranasally. 24 hours post infectionem the mice were killed and lungs and spleens were collected and homogenized to determine tissue-levels of IL- 1 β, TNF-α, IL- 4, IL- 6 and IL- 10. Lungs were also processed for bacterial burden and histology. The treatment with Ethanol and postoperative infection with K. pneumoniae lead to a significant elevation of IL- 6 and IL- 10 as well as to pronounced IL- 1 β-levels in the lungs compared to saline treated mice. In spleens a significant increase of IL- 1 β, TNF-α and IL- 10 was observed after infection with K. pneumoniae, but did not differ regarding saline or ethanol treatment. In lungs as well as in spleens, no changes were seen in levels of IL- 4. After infection, alcohol treated mice had a higher histological <b>dammage</b> and an increased infiltration of immune cells to the lung compared to saline treated mice.

40|$|Non linear dynamic {{behaviour}} of a normally excited preloaded Hertzian contact (including possible contact losses) is investigated using an experimental test rig. It consists on a double sphere plane contact loaded {{by the weight}} of a rigid moving mass. Contact vibrations are generated by a external Gaussian white noise and exhibit vibroimpact responses when the input level is sufficiently high. Spectral contents and statistics of the stationary transmitted normal force are analysed. A single-degree-of-freedom non linear oscillator including loss of contact and Hertzian non linearities is built for modelling the experimental system. Theoretical responses are obtained by using the stationary Fokker-Planck equation and also Monte Carlo simulations. When contact loss occurrence is very occasional, numerical results shown a very good agreement with experimental ones. When vibroimpacts occur, results remain in reasonable agreement with experimental ones, that justify the modelling and the numerical methods described in this paper. The contact loss non linearity appears to be rather strong compared to the Hertzian non linearity. It actually induces a large broadening of the spectral contents of the response. This result is of great importance in noise generation for a lot of systems such as mechanisms using contacts to transform motions and forces (gears, ball-bearings, cam systems, to name a few).

In Bromelia, they cause <b>dammage</b> as necrotic spots or redish stripes in the leaves and malformations of the inflorescence. Because of their tiny size and their hidden habitat, they are difficult {{to be controlled by}} predatory mites. Upon request by the Bromelia Growers Comitee of LTO Groeiservice and financed by the Horticultural Product Board, a small laboratory research has been conducted in order to find evidence of the predation by predatory mites. Five predatory mites were selected as potential predators of the Tarsonemidae mites due to their nutrional preferences, living environment and size. Four of the five selected mites, namely Neoseiulus reductus, Neoseiulus alpinus, Typhlodromips montdorensis en Neoseiulus barkeri showed a very good predatory behaviour on the offered prey. All of them notice the prey very soon and proceeded to what resulted in a very high percentage in succesfull predation. The predatory mite isolated from infected Bromelia plants, Lasioseius fimetorum was unexpectedly totally not interested in the offered prey, often walked over it without noticing it and did no efforts at all to feed himself with the prey. The results can increase the chance of succesful control of this pest in Bromelia. A necessary condition is that the predatory mites can colonize the host plants. Therefore, it is recommended to perform tests in order to evaluate the colonization of the crop at the plant level with the succesful predatory mites...|$|E

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2016 Son yıllarda meyve-sebzelerin saklamanmasında raf ömrünün uzatılmasının yanı sıra ürünün fitobesin içeriği ve tekstür gibi duyusal özelliklerinin de mümkün olduğunca korunduğu yaklaşımlar oldukça önem kazanmaktadır. Buzdolabında meyve-sebzelerin saklanmasında genellikle, sıcaklık ve nem kontrol edilirken; ışık çoğunlukla göz ardı edilmektedir. Buzdolaplarında raf ömrünü uzatma, ürün tazeliğini ve besin kalitesini koruma amaçlı dikkat edilmesi gereken yeni teknolojiler uygulama alanı bulmaktadır. Bunlar arasında başlıca görünür bölgede LED (light {{emitting}} diode) uygulamaları yer almaktadır. Bu çalışmada, + 4 °C sıcaklıkta % 90 bağıl nem koşullarında saklanan domates örneklerine görünür bölgede mavi LED ışık uygulamasının ürünün fitobesin içeriği, stoma çapı, ağırlık kaybı ve duyusal kalitesi üzerine etkisi incelenmiştir. Bu amaçla, testlerde 460 nm dalga boyunda mavi LED kullanılmıştır. Öncelikle karanlıkta depolanan ve 24 saat çalışan mavi LED altında raf ömrü boyunca saklanan domates örnekleri arasındaki fitobesin içeriği ve duyusal kalite karşılaştırılmıştır. 24 saat mavi LED uygulamasının domateslerin C vitamini, ve kabuk rengi gibi özelliklerin iyileşmesini ve depolama süresince C vitamini ve kabuk renginin yanısıra likopen içeriğinin de daha iyi korunmasını sağladığı görülmüştür. Her ne kadar, 24 saat mavi ışık uygulamasında ürünün fitobesin içeriğinin depolama süresince daha iyi korunduğu görülmüş olsa da, ürünün raf ömründe bir farklılık tespit edilmemiştir. İkinci aşamada, 24 saat mavi LED uygulaması ile 12 saat mavi LED uygulaması karşılaştırılmıştır. C vitamini miktarı, kabuk rengi değerlerinin her iki grupta da benzer seyrettiği görülmüştür. Ayrıca, likopen içeriğinin 12 saat mavi LED uygulaması yapılmış ürünlerde daha iyi korunması nedeniyle ışık uygulamasının fotoperiyot süresinin 12 saat olmasına karar verilmiştir. Bu sayede, enerji tasarrufu da sağlanmıştır. Mavi ışık uygulamasının periyotlu ya da sürekli çalışıyor olmasının da domateslerin raf ömründe bir farklılık oluşturmadığı görülmüştür. Duyusal analizlerde, panelistlerce raf ömrünün belirlenmesinde en önemli kalite kriterinin doku değişimi olduğu yorumu yapılmıştır. Ağırlık kayıplarının her iki testte de 24 saat mavi LED uygulamasında daha yüksek seyrettiği görülmüştür. Bu durumun nedeni, mavi LED ışık altında ürün stomalarının uyarılması sonucu olabileceği yorumu yapılmıştır. Ancak, stoma görselleme çalışmalarında bu durum stoma çapı uzunluklarında istatistiksel fark yaratmazken,yine de stoma çaplarının ortalama uzunluklarının depolama süresince 24 saat mavi LED ışık altında saklanan örneklerde daha yüksek olduğu görülmüştür. Sonuç olarak, bu çalışma kapsamında görünür bölgede mavi LED ışık uygulamasının, + 4 °C ve % 90 bağıl nem koşullarında depolanan domateslerin fitobesin içeriğinde (özellikle C vitamini ve likopen miktarı açısından) iyileştirmeler sağladığı görülmüştür. In recent years, {{the studies}} about extending the storage life also with preventing fitonutrition content and sensory qualities {{of fruits and}} vegetables are very popular while post harvest storage. In most studies about fresh produce in refrigerators while postharvest storage time, although temperature and humudity are controlled, the light effect is mostly ignored. Novel technologies have found the area of application about prolonging the storage life, preventing the fitonutrition quality and freshness of foods. LED applications in visible region are also located among them. First of all, for this topic, the most appropriate light sources to the fruits and vegetables were researched. In literature, it is seen that there are 4 types of lambs basically that are used in pre- and postharvest period {{of fruits and vegetables}}. These are high intensity discharge lambs, metal halogen lambs, fluorescents and LEDs. However it is also seen that high intensity discharge lambs and metal halogen lambs are used mostly in greenhouses mostly for hydroponically growing plant systems because of their large sizes. Fluorescents and LEDs can be used both in preharvest plant growing systems and also to improve quality parameters of freshproducts while postharvest period as well. However since they have bigger sizes and irradiate light with a broad spectrum, it is not preferred to use fluorescent lambs in this study. In this study, LEDs are selected to use in visible spectrum, which irradiate blue coloured light at the wavelength of 460 nm. LEDs are a semi-conducted light supply that irradiate in visible light spectrum. They can radiate monocromattically in a narrow light spectrum. With this feature, they can radiate only the necessary light spectrum for plants. The average life of LEDs are 100. 000 hours, so it is approximately 11, 5 years. They are very long-stable. The other adventages of LEDs are that they spend less energy than the other lambs, have less small sizes, are easily mountable, can radiate linear light in a specific wavelength and also are cheaper than the other types of lambs. With these adventages, it is seen in the literature that they are becoming more popular to use in food storage systems. They do not give any harm to the fresh produce, since they do not radiate heat directly. So, they are also very advantageous to use in food storage systems which they should be cold. In addition, with LED control systems, the brightness and photoperiod of light could beadjusted manually or through computer systems. In this study, the effect of LED application which irradiate blue colour in visible spectrum to the fitonutrition content and sensory qualities of tomatoes at + 4 °C temperature, % 90 relative humidity conditions were determined. The studies regarding to the effect of visible light on the products are mostly about green vegetables. In these studies, the effect of light was not determined exactly. However, the increase of vitamin C content was supposed to be contiunity of the photosynthesis reactions in post harvest storage period (photo-energetic effect). This study was done to determine the effect of visible light to products which are not green vegetables. For storage tests, tomatoes were selected which are one of the the most consumed fruits of the world. In addition, tomatoes have much nutritive value with substances such as dietary fiber, folic acid, potassium, vitamin E and C, flavanoids, carotenoids, phenolic compounds and antioxidant content. The most important quality criteria of tomatoes are the colour, texture and taste for consumer acceptance. After literature and patent applications researches, it was decided tostudy with blue and red wavelengths of visible light. Firstly, the effect of continuous blue LED light to the micronutirional and sensorical qualities of tomatoes with respect to darkness as control group. The contents of vitamin C, lycopene, total soluble solids, the changeness of outer shell colour, weight loss and sensory qualities were investigated. The initial 13, 2 mg/ 100 vitamin C content was determined 9, 0 mg/ 100 g in control group and 11, 6 mg/ 100 g in samples which are treated with 24 -hour blue LED after 14 days which was the last day of storage. In the storage period, the vitamin C content of 24 -hour blue LED light treated samples was statistically higher than control samples. According to this, it was interpreted that the blue light treatment has a preventing effect of vitamin C. This situation proves that photosynthesis reactions are not the only way increasing vitamin C content in post harvest products. Although the effect of light to post harvest products is not exactly, it could be photo-cybernetic effect. When the effect of blue LED application on lycopene content of tomatoes were investigated; it was obviously seen that the lycopene content of tomatoes which are treated with 24 -hour LED application was prevented better. In addition the lycopene content of 24 -hour LED treated samples were increased until the second day of storage period. According to this, lycopene accumulation was also triggered by 24 - hour blue LED light. Similarly, the outer shell colour of the tomatoes which are treated with 24 -hour blue LED was more reddish than the products which were stored in the darkness. Tomatoe is a climacteric fruit, as known. Therefore maturing of tomatoes continues also in the darkness. For this reason, the redness of the outer colour of the products increased in first two days which were stored even in the darkness. However, this increase was less than the products which were stored under 24 -hour blue LED light. In addition, there was not any regression between lycopene changeness and outer colour changeness in storage time period. Also, °Brix values of the tomatoes which were stored under 24 -hour blue LED light were higher than control group samples. This stiuation illustrates that the sweetness of tomatoes which were treated with blue light was better in longer time of storage. In addition, on blue LED light application, the average % weight loss of productswas higher than control samples. The weight loss of samples at the last day of storage which were treated and untreated with blue LED light were % 1, 40 and % 1, 08 respectively. The overall quality values of tomatoes in sensory analysis were quite similar, so the weight loss differences of samples did not create any difference on overall quality determination in sensory analysis. In addition in stoma visualization studies, it is also seen that the average stoma diameters were being bigger during storage in the samples that are treated with 24 hour blue LED than darkness. However the difference between these two groups and the 14 -day changeness are not found important statistically. The light dose and intensity are very important to preventlight <b>dammage</b> on product. Therefore, {{in the second part of}} this study, LED light application time was selected as 12 -hour period, which is a common photoperiod time of short-day, long-day and day-notral plants. In this situation, energy saving was targeted while selecting 12 - hour application rather than 24 -hour. The quality of products which were stored at the same conditions (as temprature and relative humudity) with previous, were treated with 12 -hour blue LED light application and were compared with 24 -hour LED blue LED light application. Among the situations of 12 -hour and 24 -hour blue LED light applications, there were no important differences on vitamin C content, total soluble solids, outer colour and sensory analysis results. Although, there were no any difference on lycopene contents among groups in the first 7 days of storage, at the end of the storage time period on the 14. day, the lycopene content of products which were stored under 12 -hour LED light were statistically higher. At the end of the storage time period the lycopene contents of products were 18, 6 mg/ 100 g and 19, 6 mg/ 100 g which were treated with 24 -hour and 12 -hour blue LED, respectively, while the initial lycopene content of groups were 35, 4 mg/ 100 g. The average % weight loss of products which were treated with 24 -hour LED light was significantly higher than samples treated with 12 -hour LED application. The weight loss of samples which were treated with 24 -hour and 12 -hour blue LED light applications, were found % 1, 69 and % 1, 30 respectively. The overall quality values of tomatoes in sensory analysis were quite similar, so the weight loss differences of samples did not create any difference on overall quality determination in sensory analysis. It is also seen that the average stoma diameters were being bigger during storage in the samples that are treated with 24 -hour blue LED than 12 -hour blue LED in stoma visualization studies. Since more light application trigger more weight loss, the average diameter of stomat and weight loss are higher in 24 -hour blue LED light application. However the difference between these two groups and the 14 -day changeness are not found important statistically. Finally, within this study, it is seen that the blue LED light application has a positive effect on the fitonutritional quality (especially the point of vitamin C and lycopene content view). For the sensory quality and storage time there is not seen any difference with the samples which stored between under blue LED and in the darkness. On the continuous blue LED light application, vitamin C increased more and also was prevented more. The vitamin C content is similar within groups whichare treated with 24 -hour and 12 -hour blue LED light. So blue LED light application is significantly better both to increase and prevent vitamin C content of tomatoes. In the future studies, this study could be repeated with the other wavelengths and on the other fruits and vegetables in different temperature conditions. As a recommendation, to prevent light damage, the photoperiods could be done as 0, 5 hour light and then 0, 5 hour darkness or 1 hour light and then 1 hour darkness. It is thought that, with this situation the fitonutrient and visual quality of products would be better than continuous light treatment during photoperiod time. Therefore, in studies after this, the effects of different photoperiod times and different wavelenths of LEDs and also the effects of different flashing periods of LED applications could be studied.
