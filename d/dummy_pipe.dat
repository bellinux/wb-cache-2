5000|$|Ayrton {{planned and}} {{supervised}} {{the building of}} the [...] "Diamond" [...] dummy pipeline, which ran southwards to help give Rommel the impression that an Armoured Corps was massing in the south. Ayrton convinced Richardson that Camouflage could implement this despite the shortage of time and materials. Ayrton's plan was to flatten and join thousands of the non-returnable 4-gallon petrol cans to make 5 miles of <b>dummy</b> <b>pipe,</b> which was laid in a trench and left for one day. The next night, the trench was filled in, and the pipe laid in a trench 5 miles further south. The trench remained about 10 miles short of its destination - {{the southern part of the}} British front line - on 23 September, showing Rommel that the pipeline and the attack were not ready. To give the pipeline realism, Ayrton planned dummy overhead storage tanks, pumphouses, and filling stations complete with dummy men and trucks. This activity was reinforced by a large dummy dump named Brian for Ayrton's cheerful assistant, Brian Robb.|$|E
40|$|At Forsmark {{nuclear power}} plant a new course called "education in {{everyday}} safety" has been started {{in an attempt to}} improve the safety culture. The goal is to spread the of expectations and approach the maintenance management has set, to all employees working at the plants. During the course, theory is mixed with practical tasks to reach a common view how work should be done to achieve safety for the plant and the people that work there. The practical tasks are done inside "maintenance simulators". They are built inside 20 ft containers which contains two <b>dummy</b> <b>pipe</b> systems. On the pipe systems some valves, a flow meter and a pump has been installed. During the course the participants are asked to act out as if they were doing maintenance work on some of the components. This is done to practice the process of how paperwork should be done as well as doing the job in a safe manner. When the maintenance simulators were built no documentation was made. During the course it has emerged that some documents such as circuit diagrams, process flow diagram, etc. could be useful to make it more realistic. The purpose of this project has therefore been to create the missing documents. This report presents how the documents were made and presents some of the results. The information about the components in the simulators were also updated in Forsmarks maintenance registry system {{to make it easier to}} create work orders...|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The Organ Façade, {{the rank}} of 61 pipes {{that make up the}} visible face of the organ upstage in the apse of the theatre. While a number of theses are <b>dummy</b> <b>pipes</b> solely for decoration, 29 are {{sounding}} pipes, making up part of two stops of the Great Organ, 12 as part of the Open Diapason 8' and 17 as part of the Violin Diapason 8'.|$|R
50|$|The school's {{pipe organ}} {{was made from}} {{the remains of a}} church organ {{salvaged}} from Sandylands Methodist Church in Morecambe, Lancashire. Bought for £400, the organ is now insured for several hundreds of thousands of pounds. A new console was added during its installation, and additional pipes were bought. The case was rebuilt and new wiring and electric bellows installed. The motor for the blower was purchased from the Trinity College of Music. As with many cathedral organs, the <b>dummy</b> <b>pipes</b> {{at the front of the}} organ are purely decorative.|$|R
50|$|The {{largest of}} the organs built by Coates was a {{keyboard}} organ (now in the Temple) completed in 1848 for the second meeting house. The organ stood {{against the back wall}} of the second meeting house between the two rear doors. It stands about fourteen feet high, housed in an impressive case assembled in three towers; to the front are three semi-circles of gilded <b>dummy</b> <b>pipes</b> which hide the wooden pipework within. The organ has a manual 49-note direct mechanical keyboard, four drawstops, and 200 wooden flue pipes in four ranks. A manual bellows is pumped from the left side.|$|R
500|$|The pipes, action, {{and wind}} system {{are almost always}} {{contained}} in a case, the design of which also may incorporate the console. The case blends the organ's sound and aids in projecting it into the room. The case often is designed to complement the building's architectural style and it may contain ornamental carvings and other decorations. The visible portion of the case, called the façade, will most often contain pipes, which may be either sounding <b>pipes</b> or <b>dummy</b> <b>pipes</b> solely for decoration. The façade pipes may be plain, burnished, gilded, or painted and are usually referred to as (en) [...] {{within the context of}} the French organ school.|$|R
50|$|This organ was {{originally}} a Forster & Andrews built {{onto the back}} wall of the church. However, when the present sanctuary was added, the instrument was moved into a newly built chamber. At that stage was almost identical in specification to the organ of St Philip & St James' Church, Booterstown. However, in 1993 Derek Verso carried out a major rebuild. The organ was taken out of the chamber and placed in the South Transept of the church. New casework was carefully constructed, modeled on the original front paneling. Old <b>dummy</b> <b>pipes</b> (stored away after the moving of the old organ to the chamber) were added to make a new side-facade. A great number of new stops were added (mostly to the Pedal, which is now very developed) and a new console was built retaining the original keyboards. It features a combination system, rare for a parish organ and very useful for repertoire and liturgy. The finished instrument is a powerful, free-standing organ, unique and one of the finest two-manuals in Dublin, at least.|$|R
5000|$|Originally, {{films were}} {{accompanied}} by pit orchestras in larger houses, and pit pianists in small venues. The first organs installed in theatres {{were nothing more than}} transplanted church organs, some of which even featured displays of <b>dummy</b> <b>pipes.</b> But these organs were ill-suited to the necessary tasks of the theatre setting, namely accompanying the film and the performance of popular tunes of the day. The earliest examples of the true theatre organ concept were modified pianos equipped with a few ranks of pipes and various sound effects, housed in one cabinet, and typically located in the pit area. These instruments were known as photoplayers and some were equipped with automatic player mechanisms using punched paper rolls, much like the popular player piano. Transplanted Englishman Robert Hope-Jones had a better idea, and his concept, which he called a [...] "unit orchestra", was developed and promoted, initially by the Rudolph Wurlitzer Company of North Tonawanda, New York. The idea quickly caught on, and a new type of instrument, the Wurlitzer Hope Jones Unit-Orchestra or simply the theatre organ, was born. This model was immediately embraced by theatre owners and soon hundreds of instruments were being ordered from Wurlitzer and other manufacturers who quickly copied the important elements of the design for their own theatre organs.|$|R

5000|$|The {{automobile}} used by George and Marion Kerby, {{before they}} become ghosts, and later by Cosmo Topper [...] - [...] whose own car is a 1936 Lincoln Model K [...] - [...] is a custom-made vehicle with a resemblance to Cord and Duesenberg automobiles of the 1930s. Production models of a Cord were too small to use, so the custom body {{was built on the}} chassis of a 1936 Buick Roadmaster by Bohman & Schwartz and the external exhaust pipes characteristic of a supercharged Cord are non-functional; the Buick Roadmaster of the time used an eight-in-line ("straight eight") engine whereas the Cord used a V-8 engine- so external exhaust pipes {{on both sides of the}} hood (as per the Cord arrangement) would have meant that at least one side of the car (and probably both) used <b>dummy</b> external <b>pipes.</b> The Buick trunk had special compartments for camera equipment. Afterwards, the car was purchased by the Gilmore Oil Co., who used it for many years for promotional purposes. In 1954, the vehicle was updated utilizing a Chrysler Imperial chassis and drive train.|$|R

They {{are standing in}} front of a fencing practice dummy and Grover has his hand resting on the <b>dummy’s</b> head. Metal <b>pipes</b> can be seen running up the brick wall in the background, along with a portion of a wooden bench. Original resource is a black and white photograph. From 1952 - 1957, the Rice Institute had a competitive fencing team taught by Coach Harold Van Buskirk. Burskirk, a member of the U. S. Olympic team in 1924, 1928, and 1932, coached fencing at Rice from the 1940 s- 1960 s...|$|R
