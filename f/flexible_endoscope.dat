The documentation and archiving of records of properly conducted reprocessing procedures is the last and increasingly {{important part of the}} reprocessing cycle for <b>flexible</b> <b>endoscopes.</b> Methods This report describes a new computer program designed to monitor and document the automatic reprocessing of <b>flexible</b> <b>endoscopes</b> and accessories in fully automatic washer-disinfectors; it does not contain nor compensate the manual cleaning step. The program implements national standards for the monitoring of hygiene in <b>flexible</b> <b>endoscopes</b> and the guidelines for the reprocessing of medical products. No FDA approval has been obtained up to now. The advantages of this newly developed computer program are firstly that it simplifies the documentation procedures of medical endoscopes and that it could be used universally with any washer-disinfector and that it is independent of the various interfaces and software products provided by the individual suppliers of washer-disinfectors. Results The computer program presented here has been tested on a total of four washer-disinfectors in more than 6000 medical examinations within 9 months. Conclusions We present for the first time an electronic documentation system for automated washer-disinfectors for medical devices e. g. <b>flexible</b> <b>endoscopes</b> which can be used on any washer-disinfectors that documents the procedures involved in the automatic cleaning process and can be easily connected to most hospital documentation systems. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{communication}} cautions healthcare facilities, including hospitals, {{ambulatory care}} facilities and private practices, {{about the risks}} to patients if <b>flexible</b> <b>endoscopes</b> and their accessories are not processed properly, and recommends steps to reduce these risks.

40|$|Flexible {{endoscopy}} is {{a widely}} used diagnostic and therapeutic procedure.

Accurate reprocessing of <b>flexible</b> <b>endoscopes</b> involves cleaning and high-level disinfection followed by rinsing and drying before storage. Most contemporary <b>flexible</b> <b>endoscopes</b> cannot be heat sterilized and are designed with multiple channels, which are difficult to clean and disinfect. The ability of bacteria to form biofilms on the inner channel surfaces can contribute to failure of the decontamination process.

50|$|POEM {{is a form}} {{of natural}} orifice translumenal {{endoscopic}} surgery, or NOTES. Like the traditional surgical myotomy, the procedure is performed under general endotracheal anesthesia. The remainder of the procedure is performed using a <b>flexible</b> <b>endoscope</b> inserted through the mouth, and no cuts are made on the chest or abdomen. Occasionally, an “overtube” is inserted to facilitate repeated removal & insertion of the endoscope. First, a submucosal injection of dyed saline creates a cushion, then a cut is made in the esophageal mucosa using electrocautery roughly 13 centimeters before the lower esophageal sphincter. Then, using hydrostatic dissection and electrocautery, the submucosal tunnel is made. Once the circular fibers of the lower esophageal sphincter are encountered, they are divided using electrocautery all the way down onto {{the first part of the}} stomach. This functionally weakens the sphincter, allowing improved passage of food and liquid into the stomach. Finally, the submucosal flap is closed using clips or sutures also placed through the endoscope.|$|E
50|$|Colon polyps are not {{commonly}} associated with symptoms. Occasionally rectal bleeding, and on rare occasions pain, diarrhea or constipation may occur because of colon polyps. Colon polyps are a concern {{because of the potential}} for colon cancer being present microscopically and the risk of benign colon polyps transforming over time into malignant ones. Since most polyps are asymptomatic, they are usually discovered at the time of colon cancer screening. Common screening methods are occult blood test, colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy (usually flexible sigmoidoscopy, using a <b>flexible</b> <b>endoscope,</b> but more rarely the older rigid sigmoidoscopy, using a rigid endoscope), lower gastrointestinal series (barium enema), digital rectal examination (DRE), and virtual colonoscopy. The polyps are routinely removed at the time of colonoscopy either with a polypectomy snare (first description by P. Deyhle, Germany, 1970) or with biopsy forceps. If an adenomatous polyp is found with sigmoidoscopy or if a polyp is found with any other diagnostic modality, the patient must undergo colonoscopy for removal of the polyp(s). Even though colon cancer is usually not found in polyps smaller than 2.5 cm, all polyps found are removed since the removal of polyps reduces the future likelihood of developing colon cancer. When adenomatous polyps are removed, a repeat colonoscopy is usually performed in three to five years.|$|E

To investigate the ability of P. aeruginosa biofilm to survive high level PAA disinfection. The susceptibility of planktonic cells of P. aeruginosa and biofilms 24, 48, 96 and 192 h old to PAA was evaluated by estimating their viability using resazurin viability and plate count methods. The biomass of the P. aeruginosa biofilms was also quantified using crystal violet assay. Planktonic cells of P. aeruginosa were treated with 5 - 30 ppm concentration of PAA in the presence of 3. 0 g/L of Bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 5 min. Biofilms of P. aeruginosa were also treated with various PAA concentrations (100 - 3000 ppm) for 5 min. Planktonic cells of P. aeruginosa were eradicated by 20 ppm of PAA, whereas biofilms showed an age dependent tolerance to PAA, and 96 h old biofilm was only eradicated at PAA concentration of 2500 ppm. 96 h old P. aeruginosa biofilm survives 5 min treatment with 2000 ppm of PAA, which is the working concentration used in some endoscope washer disinfectors.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the degradative effects of UVC light on <b>flexible</b> <b>endoscope</b> material, and investigate the potential use of 405 nm light as a non-damaging alternative. Samples of <b>flexible</b> <b>endoscope</b> insertion tube material were exposed to both germicidal light sources. Material properties were monitored using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), contact angle goniometry and confocal microscopy. The adhesion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on exposed and unexposed samples was investigated to determine the potential impact of material damage on biofouling. Samples exposed to UVC light showed significant changes: variations were observed in FTIR spectra indicating changes in polymer structure; average water contact angle decreased from 82. 6 ° to 61. 4 °; average surface roughness increased from 2. 34 nm to 68. 7 nm, and visible cracking of the surface was observed. In contrast, no significant changes were seen in samples exposed to 405 nm light. Bacterial adhesion tests showed an 86. 8 % increase in P. aeruginosa adhesion on UVC-exposed samples relative to unexposed material, and no significant increase in adhesion on samples exposed to 405 nm light.

40|$|Purpose Early {{detection}} of colorectal cancer {{is key to}} full recovery. This urged governments to start population screening programs for colorectal cancer, often using <b>flexible</b> <b>endoscopes.</b> <b>Flexible</b> endoscopy is difficult to learn and time-consuming. Automation of <b>flexible</b> <b>endoscopes</b> may increase the capacity for the screening programs. The goal of this pilot study is to investigate the clinical and technical feasibility of an assisting automated navigation algorithm for a colonoscopy procedure. Methods Automated navigation (lumen centralization) was implemented in a robotized system designed for conventional <b>flexible</b> <b>endoscopes.</b> Ten novice and eight expert users were asked to perform a diagnostic colonoscopy on a colon model twice: once using the conventional and once using the robotic system. Feasibility was evaluated using time and location data as measures of the system’s added value. Results Automated target centralization (ATC) was turned on by the novices for a median of 4. 2 % of the time during insertion and 0. 3 % during retraction. Experts turned ATC on for 4. 0 % of the time during insertion and 11. 6 % during retraction. Novices and experts showed comparable times to reach the cecum with the conventional or the robotic setup with ATC. Conclusion The ATC algorithm combined with the robotized endoscope setup works in an experimental setup that closely resembles the clinical environment and is considered feasible, although ATC use was lower than expected. For novices, {{it was unclear whether}} the low usage was due to unfamiliarity with the system or because they did not need ATC. Experts used ATC also during the retraction phase of the procedure.
