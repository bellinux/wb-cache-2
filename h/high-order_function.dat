Along with Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden in 1909, he carried out the Geiger-Marsden experiment, which demonstrated the nuclear nature of atoms by deflecting alpha particles passing through a thin gold foil. Rutherford was inspired to ask Geiger and Marsden in this experiment to look for alpha particles with very high deflection angles, of a type not expected from any theory of matter at that time. Such deflections, though rare, were found, and {{proved to be a}} smooth but <b>high-order</b> <b>function</b> of the deflection angle. It was Rutherford's interpretation of this data that led him to formulate the Rutherford model of the atom in 1911that a very small charged nucleus, containing much of the atom's mass, was orbited by low-mass electrons.|$|E

40|$|While Los Angeles {{provides}} {{an array of}} goods, services, and amenities across its expansive borders in a quintessentially polycentric manner, there continues {{to appear to be}} a lack of some of these "urban functions" in some of the densest parts of the city. This thesis serves to identify this mismatch, comparing a set of six southeast Los Angeles municipalities—whose population densities rival and sometimes exceed some of the nation's largest cities'—and a portion of Central Los Angeles of roughly the same area and density. While this study reveals that only in some cases do the southeast Los Angeles cities lack urban functions relative to the central city, they generally fall under "high-order" categories such as health care facilities and cultural centers.

40|$|We present {{calculations}} of quasiequilibrium sequences of irrotational binary neutron stars based on realistic equations of state (EOS) {{for the whole}} neutron star interior. Three realistic nuclear EOSs of various softness and based on different microscopic models have been joined with a recent realistic EOS of the crust, giving in this way three different EOSs of neutron-star interior. Computations of quasiequilibrium sequences are performed within the Isenberg-Wilson-Mathews approximation to general relativity. All evolutionary sequences {{are found to be}} stable (no turning point in the binding energy) up to the mass-shedding limit. The EOS dependence on the last orbits is found to be quite important: for two 1. 35 M_ neutron stars, the gravitational wave frequency at the mass-shedding limit (which marks the end of the inspiral phase) ranges from 800 Hz to 1200 Hz, depending upon the EOS. Detailed comparisons with 3 rd order post-Newtonian results for point-mass binaries reveals a very good agreement until hydrodynamical effects (dominated by <b>high-order</b> <b>function</b> of frequency) become important, which occurs at a frequency ranging from 500 Hz to 1050 Hz, depending upon the EOS...|$|E

An epidemiological study also demonstrated dose-dependent prolongation of distal latency and decrease in vibration sense in the lower extremities. The initial animal experiments helped to identify and analyze the initial human case of 1 -bromopropane toxicity. However, animal data that can explain the central nervous system disorders in humans are limited.

40|$|A {{composite}} strontium isotopic seawater curve {{was constructed}} for the Miocene between 24 and 6 Ma by combining 87 Sr/ 86 Sr measurements of planktonic foraminifera from Deep Sea Drilling Project sites 289 and 588. Site 289, with its virtually continuous sedimentary record and high sedimentation rates (26 m/m. y.), {{was used for}} constructing the Oligocene to mid-Miocene part of the record, which included the calibration of 63 biostratigraphic datums to the Sr seawater curve using the timescale of Cande and Kent (1992 doi: 10. 1029 / 92 JB 01202). Across the Oligocene/Miocene boundary, a brief plateau occurred in the Sr seawater curve (87 Sr/ 86 Sr values averaged 0. 70824) which is coincident with a carbon isotopic maximum (CM-O/M) from 24. 3 to 22. 6 Ma. During the early Miocene, the strontium isotopic curve was marked by a steep rise in 87 Sr/ 86 Sr that included a break in slope near 19 Ma. The rate of growth was about 60 ppm/m. y. between 22. 5 and 19. 0 Ma and increased to over 80 ppm/m. y. between 19. 0 and 16 Ma. Beginning at ~ 16 Ma (between carbon isotopic maxima CM 3 and CM 4 of Woodruff and Savin (1991 doi: 10. 1029 / 91 PA 02561)), the rate of 87 Sr/ 86 Sr growth slowed and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values were near constant from 15 to 13 Ma. After 13 Ma, growth in 87 Sr/ 86 Sr resumed and continued until ~ 9 Ma, when the rate of 87 Sr/ 86 Sr growth decreased to zero once again. The entire Miocene seawater curve can be described by a <b>high-order</b> <b>function,</b> and the first derivative (d 87 Sr/ 86 Sr/dt) of this function reveals two periods of increased slope. The greatest rate of 87 Sr/ 86 Sr change occurred during the early Miocene between ~ 20 and 16 Ma, and a smaller, but distinct, period of increased slope also occurred during the late Miocene between ~ 12 and 9 Ma. These periods of steepened slope coincide with major phases of uplift and denudation of the Himalayan-Tibetan Plateau region, supporting previous interpretations that the primary control on seawater 87 Sr/ 86 Sr during the Miocene {{was related to the}} collision of India and Asia. The rapid increase in 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values during the early Miocene from 20 to 16 Ma imply high rates of chemical weathering and dissolved riverine fluxes to the oceans. In the absence of another source of CO 2, these high rates of chemical weathering should have quickly resulted in a drawdown of atmospheric CO 2 and climatic cooling through a reversed greenhouse effect. The paleoclimatic record, however, indicates a warming trend during the early Miocene, culminating in a climatic optimum between 17 and 14. 5 Ma. We suggest that the high rates of chemical erosion and warm temperatures during the climatic optimum were caused by an increase in the contribution of volcanic CO 2 from the eruption of the Columbia River Flood Basalts (CRFB) between 17 and 15 Ma. The decrease in the rate of CRFB eruptions at 15 Ma and the removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide by increased organic carbon burial in Monterey deposits eventually led to cooling and increased glaciation between ~ 14. 5 and 13 Ma. The CRFB hypothesis helps to explain the significant time lag between the onset of increased rates of organic carbon burial in the Monterey at 17. 5 Ma (as marked by increased delta 13 C values) and the climatic cooling and glaciation during the middle Miocene (as marked by the increase in delta 18 O values), which did not begin until ~ 14. 5 Ma...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAcross {{the visual}} field, {{progressive}} differences exist in neural processing {{as well as}} perceptual abilities. Expansion of stimulus scale across eccentricity compensates for some basic visual capacities, but not for <b>high-order</b> <b>functions.</b> It was hypothesized that as with many higher-order functions, perceptual grouping ability should decline across eccentricity. To test this prediction, psychophysical measurements of grouping were made across eccentricity. Participants indicated the dominant grouping of dot grids in which grouping was based upon luminance, motion, orientation, or proximity. Across trials, the organization of stimuli was systematically decreased until perceived grouping became ambiguous. For all stimulus features, grouping ability remained relatively stable until 40 °, beyond which thresholds significantly elevated. The pattern of change across eccentricity varied across stimulus feature, in which stimulus scale, dot size, or stimulus size interacted with eccentricity effects. These results demonstrate that perceptual grouping of such stimuli is not reliant upon foveal viewing, and suggest that selection of dominant grouping patterns from ambiguous displays operates similarly {{across much of the}} visual field...|$|R
