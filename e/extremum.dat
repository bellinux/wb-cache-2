25|$|The {{critical}} {{points of}} Lagrangians occur at saddle points, {{rather than at}} local maxima (or minima). Unfortunately, many numerical optimization techniques, such as hill climbing, gradient descent, some of the quasi-Newton methods, among others, are designed to find local maxima (or minima) and not saddle points. For this reason, one must either modify the formulation to ensure that it's a minimization problem (for example, by extremizing {{the square of the}} gradient of the Lagrangian as below), or else use an optimization technique that finds stationary points (such as Newton's method without an <b>extremum</b> seeking line search) and not necessarily extrema.|$|E
