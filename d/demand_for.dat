5|$|Sugar was {{a luxury}} in Europe until the 18th century, {{when it became}} more widely available. It then became popular and by the 19th century, sugar came to be {{considered}} a necessity. This evolution of taste and <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> sugar as an essential food ingredient unleashed major economic and social changes. It drove, in part, colonization of tropical islands and nations where labor-intensive sugarcane plantations and sugar manufacturing could thrive. The <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> cheap labor to perform the hard work involved in its cultivation and processing increased the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> the slave trade from Africa (in particular West Africa). After slavery was abolished, there was high <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> indentured laborers from South Asia (in particular India). Millions of slave and indentured laborers were brought into the Caribbean and the Americas, Indian Ocean colonies, southeast Asia, Pacific Islands, and East Africa and Natal. The modern ethnic mix of many nations that have been settled in the last two centuries has been influenced by the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> sugar.|$|E

40|$|The United States {{embarked}} on a policy assuming excess <b>demands</b> <b>for</b> commodities are elastic. Some analysts question the success of that policy and argue that excess <b>demands</b> <b>for</b> farm commodities are inelastic. The controversy is deepened because the two traditional techniques <b>for</b> determining excess <b>demand</b> elasticities yield opposing estimates. We use an alternative technique based on observed variation in commodity prices, production, and use. The point estimates show excess <b>demands</b> <b>for</b> wheat, coarse grains, soybeans, rice, and cotton are elastic. However, a one-sided bootstrap test cannot reject the null hypothesis that the excess <b>demands</b> <b>for</b> wheat, coarse grains, and soybeans are inelastic. Demand and Price Analysis,...|$|R
5|$|According to Nurkse, {{underdeveloped}} countries lack adequate {{purchasing power}}. Low purchasing power {{means that the}} real income of the people is low, although in monetary terms it may be high. If the money income were low, the problem could easily be overcome by expanding the money supply; however, since the meaning {{in this context is}} real income, expanding the supply of money will only generate inflationary pressure. Neither real output nor real investment will rise. It is to be noted that a low purchasing power means that domestic <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> commodities is low. Apart from encompassing consumer goods and services, this includes the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> capital as well.|$|E

40|$|Congruence theory {{suggests}} that democratic institutions are supplied on a level that is congruent with mass <b>demands</b> <b>for</b> democracy. Recently this claim has been disconfirmed by showing that the cross-country correlation between the institutional supply of democracy and mass <b>demands</b> <b>for</b> democracy is weak. But this finding is flawed because of inflated measurements that give an embellished picture of many societies’ democratic reality. To validate this point we demonstrate that standard measures of both the institutional supply of democracy and of mass <b>demands</b> <b>for</b> democracy are often seriously deflated as one weights them by characteristics relevant to democracy in practice. These weighting procedures yield “effective” institutional supplies of democracy and “genuine” mass <b>demands</b> <b>for</b> democracy, providing a more realistic picture of a society’s state of democracy. Using these realistic measures, congruence between the institutional supply of democracy and mass <b>demands</b> <b>for</b> democracy becomes much more strongly evident, reconfirming congruence theory. Further evidence suggests that democratic congruence is rather a development-driven than an institutionally-inherited phenomenon.
