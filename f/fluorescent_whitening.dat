40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to study the addition of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>whitening</b> agents (FWAs) for efficient use on pigment coating of paper substrates with low grammage and {{the goal was to}} achieve high optical response by using low amount of FWAs. A commercial light-weight coated (LWC) paper grade was provided by Stora Enso Corbehem Mill and isotropic laboratory sheets were produced at Stora Enso Research Centre using PFI sheet former. Optical properties such as brightness, whiteness and L, a* and b* colour space values were evaluated using Minolta spectrophotometer with D 65 illuminant for both types of substrate using different types and amounts of FWA while the effect of the addition of dye was evaluated in both isotropic sheets and {{as well as in the}} coating. The results showed that brightness and whiteness of double-coated paper increased by increasing the amount of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>whitening</b> agent in the coating layer. Also, higher brightness and whiteness was achieved by introducing a higher amount of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>whitening</b> agent in the top coating rather than in a pre-coating. The addition of a shading colorant in the paper substrate had a positive influence not only on the brightness but also on the whiteness of coated paper. Syftet med denna studie var att studera tillsatsen av fluorescerande vitmedel (FWA) för att effektivisera användningen i pigmentbestrykning av papper med låg ytvikt. Målet var att nå en hög optisk respons men ändå använda en låg mängd FWA. Ett kommersiellt LWC-papper erhölls från Stora Enso, Corbehems pappersbruk, och isotropa laboratorieark tillverkades med PFI-arkformerare på Stora Enso Research Centre. Optiska egenskaper, såsom ljushet, vithet och färgrymd (L, a* och b* värden), hos samtliga prover med varierande mängd och typ av FWA uppmättes med hjälp av en Minolta spektrofotometer med D 65 ljuskälla.

40|$|A method {{combining}} microscopy with {{image analysis}} for studying ink penetration of ink-jet prints has been proposed.

The penetration depth {{and distribution of}} the ink-jet dye in the paper, which depend on the material compositions of the substrates and printed ink volumes, are then obtained by means of statistical analysis. The study focuses on uncoated fine papers, including five types of hand-sheets and two commercial papers. It is observed that ink penetration can be significantly reduced by adding internal sizing (hydrophobizing) chemicals in the hand-sheet making, while it is relatively less affected by addition of filler and <b>fluorescent</b> <b>whitening</b> agent (FWA).

40|$|The {{fluorescence}} {{efficiency of}} one <b>fluorescent</b> <b>whitening</b> agent (FWA) inuncoated and unfilled paper was characterised at different FWA concentrations. An extendedKubelka-Munk model proposed earlier by several authors {{was applied to}} quantify the effect onCIE whiteness of absorption of the FWA in the visible spectrum. At high FWA concentration,chemical interactions slightly modify the emission spectrum of the FWA, and the quantumefficiency depends on the FWA concentration. This effect has however a negligible effect onthe CIE whiteness for FWA concentrations used in practice. The overlap of the absorption andemission bands of the FWA is shown {{to be the main}} cause of greening (a shift of thechromaticity towards green) and saturation of the fluorescence effect.

Both of these two effects can facilitate the adsorption of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>whitening</b> agents (FWAs) by the combination of increased specific surface area, electrostatic forces, and hydrophobic interactions, thus compensating {{for the loss of}} optical properties resulting from LC refining. The mechanical hydraulic force generated by the high refining energy disturbed the FWA retention. Therefore, high refining energy could improve the adsorption of FWAs when they are added after refining, but for better performance, the refining energy should be controlled and lowered. In addition, small amounts of calcium salt added after refining can also ameliorate the adsorption of FWAs...|$|E

The impact of this LED illumination for various colorimetric applications has been generally considered {{in terms of its}} colour rendering index (CRI).

Different materials were mixed at predetermined ratios and deposited together to form a 3 D object with variable properties and functionalities that meet specific requirements. To demonstrate the capability of this AM system, heat-sensitive olyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) and its additives were processed.

The observation of fluorescence with the naked eye is highly subjective. Thus, it is essential to develop a more scientific and objective to the quantitative analysis of FWA optical effects. Water and paper samples containing FWAs were prepared in a laboratory. Quantitative analysis was carried out with a spectrofluorometer, a spectrophotometer, and an image restoration microscope.

Scanning electron microscopy provided images of the cylindrical fibers with dimensions of 3. 5 cm (length) and 13. 3 mu m (thickness), with empty cores of 1 mu m diameter and a smooth surface. Atomic force microscopy showed a fiber surface with disoriented nanometric domains using both tapping-mode height and phase image modes.

Transmission electron microscopy showed fibers with nanometric parallel cylinders, surrounded by holes where the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>whitening</b> molecules accumulated. On the basis of these techniques, we conclude that the sorption process occurs preferentially on the fiber surface in contact with the water solution, and under saturated conditions, the whitening agent penetrates into the pores and are simultaneously sorbed on the pore walls bulk, forming molecular aggregates.

40|$|It has earlier {{been shown}} that light {{reflected}} {{from the body of}} paper exhibit anisotropic behavior. On the other hand, fluorescence emission is often assumed to be distributed in a Lambertian manner.

The angular dependency of the radiance factors was measured for a range of excitation wavelengths. Moreover, the influence of fillers and <b>fluorescent</b> <b>whitening</b> agents (FWA) on the anisotropy was studied. The measurements show that the anisotropy of the total radiance factor of paper decreases when an increasing amount of FWA is added to the paper. The same effect was also observed when an increased amount of filler was added to the paper. In addition, it was shown that the presence of fillers reduce the effect of the FWA. The results show that in comparison to the anisotropy of the total radiance factor from the paper samples, the anisotropy of the fluorescence alone is negligible. Hence, for paper samples containing FWA evenly distributed in the bulk, the fluorescence alone should not induce significant differences between color measuring instruments of different measurement geometries...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{modelling}} and predicting the perceived whiteness of plain {{paper from the}} paper composition, including <b>fluorescent</b> <b>whitening</b> agents. This includes psycho-physical modelling of perceived whiteness from measurable light reflectance properties, and physical modelling of light scattering and fluorescence from the paper composition. Existing models are first tested and improvements are suggested and evaluated. The standardised and widely used CIE whiteness equation is first tested on commercial office papers with visual evaluations by different panels of observers, and improved models are validated. Simultaneous contrast effects, known to affect the appearance of coloured surfaces depending on the surrounding colour, are shown to significantly affect the perceived whiteness. A colour appearance model including simultaneous contrast effects  (CIECAM 02 -m 2), earlier tested on coloured surfaces, is successfully applied to perceived whiteness. A recently proposed extension of the Kubelka-Munk light scattering model including fluorescence for turbid media of finite thickness is successfully tested {{for the first time}} on real papers. It is shown that the linear CIE whiteness equation fails to predict the perceived whiteness of highly white papers with distinct bluish tint. This equation is applicable only in a defined region of the colour space, a condition that is shown to be not fulfilled by many commercial office papers, although they appear white to most observers. The proposed non-linear whiteness equations give to these papers a whiteness value that correlates with their perceived whiteness, while application of the CIE whiteness equation outside its region of validity overestimates perceived whiteness. It is shown that the quantum efficiency of two different <b>fluorescent</b> <b>whitening</b> agents (FWA) in plain paper is rather constant with FWA type, FWA concentration, filler content, and fibre type. Hence, the fluorescence efficiency is essentially dependent only on the ability of the FWA to absorb light in its absorption band.   Increased FWA concentration leads accordingly to increased whiteness. However, since FWA absorbs light in the violet-blue region of the electromagnetic spectrum, the reflectance factor decreases in that region with increasing FWA amount. This violet-blue absorption tends to give a greener shade to the paper and explains most of the observed greening and whiteness saturation at larger FWA concentrations. A red-ward shift of the quantum efficiency is observed with increasing FWA concentration, but this is shown to have a negligible effect on the whiteness value. The results are directly applicable to industrial applications for better instrumental measurement of whiteness and thereby optimising the use of FWA with the goal to improve the perceived whiteness. In addition, a modular Monte Carlo simulation tool, Open PaperOpt, is developed to allow future spatial- and angle-resolved particle level light scattering simulation.  PaperOp...|$|E

The disappearances of the oxidation products were shown to only involve the attack of HO• radicals; the quantum yields of disappearances are wavelength dependent as the formation of the hydroxyl radicals is.

The most resistant cultivars of P. tenax in an aqueous antifungal assay also possessed the greatest variety of naturally-occurring 7 -hydroxycoumarins as identified by mass spectroscopy, ESI-MS. In addition to antifungal effects, coumarins function as <b>fluorescent</b> <b>whitening</b> agents in Phormium fibres and {{play a role in the}} fibre’s photodegradation. Ultraviolet irradiation (350 – 400 nm) of the fibre resulted in a substantial loss of the blue fluorescence originating from a number of 7 -hydroxycoumarins present, together with the formation of new fluorophores absorbing and emitting at longer wavelengths, which contribute to the photoyellowing of the fibre. The photolysis of two standard 7 -hydroxycoumarins in aqueous solution was examined and two primary photoproducts were elucidated by ESI-MS: a photodimer containing a linking cyclobutane ring and a monomeric photooxidation product. The formation of at least some of the photoproducts is associated with the coumarin-sensitised generation of reactive oxygen species, hydrogen peroxide and superoxide. The fluorescence properties and photodegradation of Chinese handmade papers were also investigated. Papers manufactured by traditional methods were found to be more photostable than that produced from chemically-facilitated techniques...|$|E
40|$|Real-time {{monitoring}} of water quality for sewer system {{is required for}} efficient sewer network design because it provides information on the precise loading of pollutant to wastewater treatment facilities {{and the impact of}} loading on receiving water. In this study, synchronous fluorescence spectra and its first derivatives were investigated using a number of wastewater samples collected in sewer systems in urban and non-urban areas, and the optimum fluorescence feature was explored for the estimation of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentrations of sewer samples. The temporal variations in BOD and COD showed a regular pattern for urban areas whereas they were relatively irregular for non-urban areas. Irrespective of the sewer pipes and the types of the areas, two distinct peaks were identified from the synchronous fluorescence spectra, which correspond to protein-like fluorescence (PLF) and humic-like fluorescence (HLF), respectively. HLF in sewer samples appears to be associated with <b>fluorescent</b> <b>whitening</b> agents. Five fluorescence characteristics were selected from the synchronous spectra and the first-derivatives. Among the selected fluorescence indices, a peak in the PLF region (i. e., Index I) showed the highest correlation coefficient with both BOD and COD. A multiple regression approach based on suspended solid (SS) and Index I used to compensate for the contribution of SS to BOD and COD revealed an improvement in the estimation capability, showing good correlation coefficients of 0. 92 and 0. 94 for BOD and COD, respectively...|$|E
