500|$|Gene Kranz {{called a}} meeting of his staff in Mission Control {{three days after the}} accident, {{delivering}} a speech which has subsequently become one of NASA's principles. Speaking of the errors and overall attitude surrounding the Apollo program before the accident, he stated: [...] "We were too 'gung-ho' about the schedule and we blocked out all of the problems we saw each day <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>work.</b> Every element of the program was in trouble and so were we." [...] He reminded the team of the perils and mercilessness of their endeavor, and stated the new requirement that every member of every team in mission control be [...] "tough and competent", requiring nothing less than perfection throughout NASA's programs. In 2003, following the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, NASA administrator Sean O'Keefe quoted Kranz's speech, applying it to the Columbia crew.|$|E
500|$|Benfica started December with a Derby de Lisboa {{game against}} Sporting. They won 3–0, with a first half goal by Van Hooijdonk and two {{goals in a}} five-minute span from João Tomás. Following the win, Mourinho {{requested}} a contract extension as a demonstration {{of faith in the}} work he had put in along with his assistant: [...] "Me [...] and Mozer thought {{that the only way to}} end speculation and the constant threat of being sacked in the event of a bad result...was renewing our contracts for another season." [...] Their proposal was not met. They parted ways with the club through an announcement in a press conference: [...] "He [...] thought it was better not to accept our request. We understood that decision showed a lack of trust <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>work,</b> and that we should offer our resignation..." [...] Benfica immediately appointed Toni – a long-time favourite of the President – as the new manager. On 10 December, Benfica played Alverca away from home. They opened the score sheet with a goal from João Tomás close to half-time, but Mantorras equalized. Later, Milinkovic put the Ribatejo side in the lead, resulting in the fourth loss in seven matches in away games for Benfica. In the last match of the year 2000, Benfica met a struggling Gil Vicente, who were at the bottom of the Primeira Liga standings. Unable to unlock the 0–0 draw, the club suffered their eighth winless league game of the season.|$|E

[...] He emphasized the recommendations from the report were ready to be put into practice, [...] "This means we must not only continue pressing forward to implement the actionable measures we devised <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>work</b> last Congress in the Task Force on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel, but we must also continue adapting our efforts as the threat landscape continues to evolve." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2014, Princess Märtha Louise faced some {{criticism}} {{due to her}} association with British clairvoyant, Lisa Williams. Williams was in Oslo on 14 September 2014 and gave a seminar for Soulspring, {{formerly known as the}} Angel School, which Princess Märtha Louise co-founded. Williams is known for her claims she can communicate with the deceased. The Soulspring website carried the following message: “We in Soulspring do not communicate with dead souls <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>work.</b> And here is where our work is separate from Lisa’s. To be completely honest, we don't see the point of contacting the dead. They passed {{over to the other side}} for a reason and should be allowed to stay there."

2500|$|Another {{witness who}} testified {{on behalf of}} then-Judge Thomas was Nancy Fitch, a special {{assistant}} historian to Thomas at EEOC, who said [...] "here is no way" [...] Thomas did what Hill alleged. [...] "I know he did no such thing," [...] she declared under oath. Also Diane Holt, Thomas' personal secretary for six years, said that, [...] "At no time did Professor Hill intimate, {{not even in the}} most subtle of ways, that Judge Thomas was asking her out or subjecting her to the crude, abusive conversations that have been described. Nor did I ever discern any discomfort, when Professor Hill was in Judge Thomas' presence." [...] Additionally, Phyllis Berry-Myers, another special assistant to Thomas, said that he [...] "was respectful, demand of excellence <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>work,</b> cordial, professional, interested in our lives and our career ambitions". Berry-Myers said that her [...] "impression" [...] was that Professor Hill desired a greater relationship with Judge Thomas than [...] "just a professional one".|$|E

2500|$|Technology, Davidson argues, re-shapes the way {{we learn}} and process new {{information}} in some fundamental ways. We surf hundreds of news feeds, immediately discriminating between the ones we need to read and the ones we don't. <b>In</b> <b>our</b> <b>work</b> environments, {{we are forced to}} focus, divide, and re-focus our attention as we are dealing with multiple tasks at the same time. Within this multitasking that the new workplace requires, Davidson urges her readers to re-imagine the concept of distraction. We are cultured to imagine that shopping online while finishing a report or answering personal emails and simultaneously working on a project are distractions which are detrimental to our productivity and efficiency. Every time we switch tasks, we are hurting our work. Davidson argues, however, that these small distractions afforded by technology should be thought of as innovations. [...] "When we feel distracted, something’s up. Distraction is really another word for saying that something is new, strange or different. We should pay attention to that feeling… Distraction {{is one of the best}} tools for innovation we have at our disposal—for changing patterns of attention and beginning the process of learning new patterns" ...|$|E
