40|$|This paper explores two {{different}} approaches to information processing and learning in societal safety efforts; stressing the specifics and aiming at the general. How the two approaches relate to higher-level efforts at societal safety is discussed, {{as well as the}} relationship between the two approaches and their consequences. As a background, the paper briefly explores the concept of <b>generic</b> <b>capability</b> - What is it? How can it be understood? How can it be developed? - and relates it to the interplay between specifics and generalities. The paper outlines examples of factors that may contribute to generic capabilities represented in the safety and emergency management literature. From the traditions of continuity management, resilience engineering and high reliability organizations examples are given and discussed in terms of focus on the specific and/or the general. The paper also discusses scenario-based learning and the perspective of semantic hierarchies, which explains how a move to more abstract concepts, encompassing the main meaning of more concrete instances, may support the development of <b>generic</b> <b>capability.</b> Conclusions regarding suggestions for practice and needs for further research are presented...|$|E

In this paper we show how understanding the variation in students' experience of learning a specific <b>generic</b> <b>capability</b> represents the first step in designing assessment instruments for bringing about desirable learning outcomes. Our research has revealed that from a student's perspective two major elements produce changes in conception or experience. From a teacher's perspective, these changes should lead the student into desirable learning outcomes. The two elements identified by students are assignments designed to encourage reflection and the characteristics of the teaching staff.

While this reflects emerging local and global trends to encourage creativity at every educational level, creativity as a <b>generic</b> <b>capability</b> has special difficulties.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{development}} of <b>generic</b> <b>capabilities</b> in an RMIT undergraduate logistics degree program. <b>Generic</b> <b>capabilities</b> are those general graduate attributes {{that are not}} specifically discipline-focused, examples being communication and teamwork skills. A major research objective of this thesis {{is the extent to}} which graduates perceived that <b>generic</b> <b>capabilities</b> were developed in their RMIT logistics undergraduate program, specifically in a cross-cultural context spanning a range of organisations differing in size and ownership structure. The thesis involves two studies. In Study 1 managers from eight organisations, ranging in size from multi-national to small public and private (family-owned) companies were interviewed to develop a series of qualitative organisational case studies using grounded theory methodology. Study 2 is a quantitative survey of 31 Australian and 25 Asian (Singapore and Hong Kong) logistic graduates from 1996 to 2002. In Study 1, <b>generic</b> <b>capabilities</b> rankings in different organisations varied, depending on whether managers being interviewed were operational or human resource management specialists, but there was general agreement that communication, problem-solving, initiative and enterprise, and teamwork skills were highest priority. Study 2 results indicate that the views of both Asian and Australian graduates are in line with the management rankings, and are consistent with those reported by Australian and OECD government and industry research organisations. Both graduate groups agree that <b>generic</b> <b>capabilities</b> are covered in the RMIT logistic program, but ratings are generally in an &# 039;adequate&# 039; to &# 039;good&# 039; range, with no outstanding features. Although cultural diversity in the student body is seen as a major benefit, there are little data indicating a high level of Australian and Asian student networking, and a number of respondents are critical of a lack of international focus in the present program. A major issue is a n eed for more emphasis on presentation and problem-solving skills so graduates are able to carry through a project from initiation to completion...|$|R

This is the leading edge of capabilities which should ultimately be as ubiquitous as CRTs (cathode-ray tubes). These assertions are not from degrees in science or only from a degree in graphic design, but in a history of computer graphics innovations, laying groundwork by demonstration.

This paper seeks to advance this literature by distinguishing between a dual capability upgrading strategy, which implies the acquisitions of both technology and complementary capabilities, and a pure complementary capability strategy, and by relating them to the technological intensity of acquiring and target firms. Hypotheses are developed and tested on a large sample of more than 600 acquisitions undertaken by firms located in Brazil, Russia, India and China in Europe, North America and Japan between 1985 and 2008. Results show that firms belonging to medium-tech manufacturing and services industries pursue a dual capability upgrading strategy by investing in high-tech industries, while high-tech and low-tech EMNEs pursue a pure complementary capability strategy...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} an {{important}} new service management strategy: the operations capabilities-service quality-performance (C-SQ-P) triad. In {{order to understand}} what <b>generic</b> operations <b>capabilities</b> influence the strategic behavior of high performing service firms, we explore three related questions: What <b>generic</b> operations <b>capabilities</b> are among the strategic determinants of service quality? Does service quality affect market performance? How is market conduct related to the C-SQ-P triad? These questions are investigated using a stylized capabilities-based model of service quality that simultaneously assesses their impact upon a firm's market performance. Several insights emerge from our research: a) <b>generic</b> operations <b>capabilities</b> affect service quality and performance, although not all relationships are direct; b) service quality know-how and innovations can be directly observed and imitated; c) the effects of technological leadership and market acuity on service quality are moderated by the absorptive capacity of employees to recognize and exploit their potential, and hence, investments in people are critical to success; d) market conduct influences the <b>generic</b> <b>capabilities</b> of the firm more than market performance, ceteris paribus; and e) total factor productivity and service quality are negatively correlated. operations strategy, capabilities-based competition, absorptive capacity, resource based view, competitive advantage, service management performance...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new knowledge acquisition method using a generic design environment where context-sensitive knowledge {{is used to}} build specific DSS for rural business. Although standard knowledge acquisition methods have been applied in rural business applications, uptake remains low and familiar weaknesses such as obsolescence and brittleness apply. We describe a decision support system (DSS) building environment where contextual factors relevant to the end users are directly taken into consideration. This "end user enabled design environment" (EUEDE) engages both domain experts in creating an expert knowledge base and business operators/end users (such as farmers) in using this knowledge for building their specific DSS. We document the knowledge organisation for the problem domain, namely a dairy industry application. This development involved a case-study research approach used to explore dairy operational knowledge. In this system end users can tailor their decision-making requirements using their own judgement to build specific DSSs.

Financial literacy is seen in this study as a function of student understanding of a limited set of interrelated economic concepts that can be used as tools to assess financial situations and make sound financial decisions. Twelve teachers participated in the study. Six worked together in a learning study group and drew on a particular theory of learning in planning and carrying out lessons designed to serve the learning aims, whereas the other six worked collaboratively in a lesson study group. To evaluate the effectiveness of the two learning conditions created by the two groups, 193 students answered questions on complex, everyday financial situations in four tests: a pretest, a posttest following the research lessons, and delayed posttests 6 weeks and 6 months after instruction. The results showed that students in the learning study group outperformed their counterparts in the lesson study group in all three post-lesson tests, and that the inter-group performance gap was maintained or widened over time. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|The skills {{required}} {{by a student}} to excel both academically and in their chosen professional careers have been identified by many institutions, and {{can be referred to}} as 'generic capabilities'. These <b>generic</b> <b>capabilities</b> can extend from interpersonal skills, problem solving, oral communication and career skills. In recent years concerns have been raised about a gap emerging between graduate attributes developed in university degrees and what industry requires (Yap, 1997; Albrecht and Sack, 2000; Kavanagh and Drennen, 2008). This {{is often referred to as}} a lack of 'employment readiness' of students and the need to engage industry with students and the curriculum. Such a concern was highlighted in the 2007 report titled 'Graduate Employability Skills' prepared for the Business, Industry and Higher Education Collaboration Council. One of the generic skills of concern is career skills, which relates to knowledge of the relevant profession, the ability to interact with the profession and seek a career. To address this concern a Professional Development Program (the PDP) was developed. The PDP is integrated into a Business Degree and is designed to systematically develop students' learning, employment and generic skills and supplements their theoretical studies. It is argued that this integration of the PDP permeating throughout the Degree enhances students' <b>generic</b> <b>capabilities,</b> including their career skills. This paper details the procedures that have been developed, and provides preliminary evidence that the PDP has, from the perspective of students, made a substantial contribution to the building of a 'professional'.
