40|$|Drawing {{on small}} area {{data from the}} latest 2006 Census this paper {{presents}} findings on the spatial distribution of neighbourhood labour market <b>disadvantage</b> <b>in</b> Sydney and Melbourne, and its key drivers. Moran's I and Geary's C statistics are employed to assess the degree of global spatial dependence in key socio-economic variables, and the change in spatial clustering between the three Census periods 1996, 2001 and 2006. The paper also employs spatial econometric models of suburb unemployment rates to provide estimates of neighbourhood spillovers for 2006. Results suggest spatial spillovers are significant in determining labour market <b>disadvantage</b> <b>in</b> both Sydney and Melbourne, and play {{a larger role in}} determining labour market <b>disadvantage</b> <b>in</b> low socio-economic status neighbourhoods, coinpared to more affluent neighbourhoods...|$|R

40|$|Butyrate, a short-chain {{fatty acid}} {{produced}} in the colon, induces cell cycle arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis in transformed cell lines. In this report, we {{study the effects of}} butyrate (BuA) on the growth of Ehrlich ascites tumor (<b>EAT)</b> cells <b>in</b> vivo. BuA, when injected intraperitoneally (i. p) into mice, inhibited proliferation of EAT cells. Further, induction of apoptosis <b>in</b> <b>EAT</b> cells was monitored by nuclear condensation, annexin-V staining, DNA fragmentation, and translocation of caspase-activated DNase into nucleus upon BuA-treatment. Ac-DEVD-CHO, a caspase- 3 inhibitor, completely inhibited BuA-induced apoptosis, indicating that activation of caspase- 3 mediates the apoptotic pathway <b>in</b> <b>EAT</b> cells. The proapoptotic effect of BuA also reflects on the antiangiogenic pathway <b>in</b> <b>EAT</b> cells. The antiangiogenic effect of BuA in vivo was demonstrated by the downregulation of the secretion of VEGF <b>in</b> <b>EAT</b> cells. CD 31 immunohistochemical staining of peritoneum sections clearly indicated a potential angioinhibitory effect of BuA <b>in</b> <b>EAT</b> cells. These results suggest that BuA, besides regulating other fundamental cellular processes, is able to modulate the expression/secretion of the key angiogenic growth factor VEGF <b>in</b> <b>EAT</b> cells.

30|$|The away <b>disadvantage</b> <b>in</b> defensiveness is, of course, not {{yet that}} in games won or lost. However, as Game Number increases, injury {{prevalence}} and defensiveness due to injuries also increase (linearly). Further, away <b>disadvantage</b> <b>in</b> total defensiveness, mediated by an away focus on opposing players and resultant poor teamwork, leads directly to away <b>disadvantage</b> <b>in</b> game outcome or, {{which is the}} same thing, home advantage in game outcome (Jones 2015). Thus the course of home advantage in games won or lost as a function of Game Number should be similar to the curve depicted in Fig.  2; and so it is (see the curve for 2005 – 2014 in Fig.  1). It is only necessary to suppose that by mid-season defensiveness due to injuries has exceeded defensiveness due to playing away.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is twofold. First, it is to enhance conceptual clarity in the consumer behavior literature on consumer disadvantage by investigating the role of racial inequality in consumer experiences in markets for basic needs products. That is, this research analyzes how consumer <b>disadvantage</b> is experienced <b>in</b> markets for food and health care in order to illustrate the operation of racial inequality situated in a context where class and gender inequality also operate simultaneously. A second {{purpose of this}} project is to construct and assess a grounded typology of consumer responses to <b>disadvantage</b> <b>in</b> such settings. The emergent {{findings in this study}} are that racial inequality primarily structures the operation of <b>disadvantage</b> <b>in</b> markets for food, and class-based inequality primarily structures the operation of <b>disadvantage</b> <b>in</b> markets for health care. However, while a single inequality form may structure the operation of <b>disadvantage</b> <b>in</b> each market multiple forms of inequality are present. An additional emergent finding is that consumers employ resistance and coping strategies to address their disadvantaged status consistent with human ecology theory. These individual acts of human agency also interact with impediments produced by social structure to create an array of responses to disadvantage that have varying degrees of effectiveness and functionality...|$|R

40|$|WOS: 000393629800002 International audienceRothbart's {{model of}} temperament, defined as {{individual}} differences in reactivity and self-regulation, has a strong heuristic value with applications {{in a wide variety}} of children's outcomes. Our objective was to test Rothbart's model applied to children's food behaviours and BMI outcome through behavioural measures. Our hypotheses, according to Rothbart's model, were as follows: (i) self-regulation <b>in</b> <b>eating</b> modulates appetite reactivity; (ii) appetite reactivity increases the risk of excess BMI, whereas self regulation <b>in</b> <b>eating</b> limits this risk. One hundred and four children aged between 7 and 12 years completed four behavioural tasks to assess scores for two components of appetite reactivity (i. e. appetite arousal and appetite persistence) and two components of self-regulation <b>in</b> <b>eating</b> (i. e. self-regulation <b>in</b> <b>eating</b> without hunger and self-regulation <b>in</b> <b>eating</b> speed). Their heights and weights were measured in order to calculate their BMI-for-age. T-tests and regression analysis were used to verify our hypotheses. None of the scores of self-regulation <b>in</b> <b>eating</b> was directly associated with BMI but we observed a significant impact of self-regulation <b>in</b> <b>eating</b> without hunger on appetite arousal (p-value = 0. 04), together with a modest but significant association between appetite persistence and BMI (p value = 0. 02). We can thus conclude that our behavioural measures could be used for the determination of the child's eating temperament. Further studies are needed to investigate how to use these measures to improve the treatment of overweight in children. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
