The new console, with a completely redesigned case {{which has a}} sliding <b>door</b> <b>covering</b> the disc drive (which has been moved {{to the top of}} the console), is 4.3 pounds, almost three pounds lighter than the previous [...] "slim" [...] model. The console comes with either 12GB flash memory or a 250GB, 500GB hard drive. Several bundles which include a Super Slim PS3 and a selection of games are available.|$|E
60|$|The sad quiet grey-blue glow of {{the dying}} day came {{through the window and}} the open <b>door,</b> <b>covering</b> over and allaying quietly a sudden {{instinct}} of remorse in Stephen's heart. All that had been denied them had been freely given to him, the eldest; but the quiet glow of evening showed him in their faces no sign of rancour.|$|E

50|$|Both 680x0 and MIPS models {{shared the}} same case, which had a large <b>door</b> <b>covering</b> a floppy drive and a 5.25-in {{expansion}} bay which could house a SCSI tape or CD-ROM drive. The details of the door were slightly different: two windows for the 680x0 models while the MIPS ones had a single large window. Also hidden by the cover were a reset button {{and a series of}} DIP switches used to configure some bootup parameters.|$|E
25|$|Flight day 1 on-orbit {{operations}} included, {{opening of}} the both payload bay doors of Atlantis at 21:12 GMT, deploying the radiators, deploying Ku-Band antenna to gain favorable communications, {{opening of the}} protective <b>doors</b> <b>covering</b> the star trackers on {{the nose of the}} shuttle, setting up the onboard computer network, downlinking imagery and data collected during the flight into orbit, getting out of their launch and entry spacesuits and stowing away the mission specialists' seats.|$|R

Each parish can have its image {{to use it in}} novenas, processions and other activities. Some parishes {{organize}} an itinerary for its parish image, where it visits the various chapels, schools, church groups, etc. Normally, the parish pilgrim image is under the care of the parish coordination team, which may delegate responsibility to a leadership campaign.|$|R
5|$|On 12 January 2004 Queen Mary 2 {{set sail}} on her maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in the United States, {{carrying}} 2,620 passengers. She {{was under the}} command of captain Ronald Warwick, who had previously commanded Queen Elizabeth 2. Warwick is the son of William (Bill) Warwick, who had also been a senior Cunard officer and the first captain of Queen Elizabeth 2. The ship returned to Southampton late from her maiden voyage after bow <b>doors</b> <b>covering</b> the thrusters failed to shut in Portugal.|$|R
50|$|On {{the right}} side of the main altar, next to the railing of the choir below, is a small doorway through which the nuns {{received}} communion. The frame of this doorway is made of stone and is carved with two mermaids with their tails crossed, supporting an oval with a well, a symbol of wisdom. In the center of the <b>door</b> <b>covering</b> this window is an Eye of Providence surrounded by rays of light and foliage.|$|E
50|$|In the past, many tower cases {{intended}} to house file servers featured a locking <b>door</b> <b>covering</b> the external drive bays. This was a security feature {{intended to}} prevent the theft of the CD-ROM discs the drives would be holding. At the time, CD-ROM capacity was larger than the hard disks available, and many business-critical databases were distributed on this media. These databases were often very expensive or held proprietary data, and hence would be likely targets for casual theft.|$|E

50|$|Roller doors ("Sheet Doors"-USA) {{are usually}} {{constructed}} of corrugated steel. They evolved from cover window and <b>door</b> <b>coverings.</b> Other materials {{can be used}} (e.g.; transparent corrugated fibreglass) where strong impact resistance is not required. Corrugations give the door strength against impacts. A typical single car garage roller door has a preloaded spring inside the rolling mechanism. The spring reduces the effort required to open the door. Larger roller doors in commercial premises are not sprung (except USA) and use a manual pulley and chain system or a geared motor to raise and lower (roll up and roll down) the door. Roller doors cannot be effectively insulated.|$|R
60|$|Upon {{a raised}} {{platform}} {{at one side}} was a heavy table on which lay Glinda's Great Book of Records, but the platform was firmly fastened {{to the floor and}} the table was fastened to the platform and the Book was chained fast to the table, just as it had been when it was kept in Glinda's palace. On the wall over the table hung Ozma's Magic Picture. On a row of shelves at {{the opposite side of the}} hall stood all the chemicals and essences of magic and all the magical instruments that had been stolen from Glinda and Ozma and the Wizard, with glass <b>doors</b> <b>covering</b> the shelves so that no one could get at them.|$|R
50|$|Keying was {{accomplished}} by setting each switch in a matrix of switches to one of several positions. This was done using a separate mechanical key loader (KYK-28) that had a matching matrix of pins that could be set to different heights as instructed by a key list. The key loader was pushed into a matrix of holes, one hole for each switch. The loader also had two larger index pins that also cocked a spring that would return each switch to their initial position when the <b>door</b> <b>covering</b> the hole matrix was reopened, zeroizing the equipment.|$|E
5000|$|Laundry lockers {{are used}} in places like {{hospitals}} and food-processing workplaces where uniforms have to be collected, laundered, then returned to their owners. The locker cabinet contains {{a number of very}} narrow lockers, each of whose doors is keyed using a key held by the owner, so that they have access only to their own locker; but the entire array of doors is embedded in a much larger <b>door</b> <b>covering</b> the entire front of the cabinet. Opening this opens all the lockers simultaneously, and requires the use of a master key which is held by whoever collects items deposited in lockers, for laundering, then returned in the same way, after which they items are accessible to owners using their individual small doors.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} obtain basic {{radiation}} properties of the radiator/payload bay door cavity, three tests were conducted on a full-size structural simulator of the cavity. There were three tests conducted: (1) CATA used for determination of exchange factors, absorbed solar flux, and <b>door</b> <b>covering</b> influences, (2) quartz lamp array calibrated to provide IR flux distribution on CATA, and (3) retest with radiometer array for background flux measurement...|$|E
50|$|In addition, a VVPAT {{component}} may not {{be easily}} usable by poll-workers, {{many of whom are}} already struggling with DRE maintenance and use and new elections law requirements. In the 2006 primary election in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, a study found that 9.6 percent of the VVPAT tapes were either destroyed, blank, illegible, missing, taped together or otherwise compromised. In one case the thermal paper was loaded into the printer backwards leaving a blank tape, which was not realized by voters who couldn't verify the paper trail. The Cuyahoga Election Review Panel proposed in its final report to remove the opaque <b>doors</b> <b>covering</b> the VVPAT except the ones equipped with equipment for blind voters. In general collecting and counting these printed records can be difficult.|$|R
25|$|The {{purpose of}} door guards (also known as hinge guards, anti-finger {{trapping}} devices, or finger guards) {{is to reduce}} the number of finger trapping accidents in doors, as doors pose a risk to children especially when closing. Door guards protect fingers in <b>door</b> hinges by <b>covering</b> the gap that is created by opening <b>doors</b> by <b>covering</b> the hinges of doors with a piece of rubber or plastic that wraps from the door frame to the door. There are also door safety products which eject the fingers from the push side of the door as it is being closed.|$|R
2500|$|Externally the K series {{could be}} {{identified}} by changes in {{the locations of the}} radio equipment hatch, which was moved forward and to a higher position between frames four and five and the filler point for the fuselage fuel tank, which was moved forward to a location between frames two and three. The D/F loop was moved aft to sit between frames three and four on the fuselage spine and a small circular plate above the footstep on the port side of the fuselage was deleted. The rudder was fitted as standard with a Flettner tab and two fixed tabs although some rare examples were not fitted with the fixed tabs. All K-4s were to be fitted with a long retractable tail wheel (...) with two small clamshell <b>doors</b> <b>covering</b> the recess when the tail-wheel was retracted.|$|R

50|$|Styling was {{up-to-date}} with sharply formed {{edges and}} large rectangular headlights. The front bumper covered only the corners, allowing the grill {{to be much}} more prominent than normal. The roof line terminated behind the large door on each side. Above the rear waistline were a pair of side hinged clam shell <b>doors</b> <b>covering</b> the entire rear section. An integrated roll bar terminated the body work and also formed a place for the clam shell doors to seal. The clam shell doors met each {{in the middle of the}} roof with no centre support. When the doors were raised you could stretch a tent between them. Two adults could sleep in the tent section and another two adults could sleep on the front seats, which could fold down flat. Finally, the rear section included a full width tail gate with a wind-down window nestled under the rear roll bar.|$|R
5000|$|Another offline {{mail packet}} format called QWK {{was created in}} 1987, but only ran on the {{commercial}} PCBoard system. It remained less widely used than Blue Wave until new QWK <b>doors</b> appeared <b>covering</b> {{many of the same}} BBS systems. The Blue Wave client software was then adapted to allow it to read and write QWK as well as Blue Wave files.|$|R
50|$|The An-148 {{aircraft}} is a high-wing monoplane {{with two}} turbofan jet engines mounted in pods under the wing. This arrangement protects the engines and wing structure against damage from foreign objects (FOD). A built-in auto-diagnosis system, auxiliary power unit, high reliability, and the wing configuration allow the An-148 {{to be used}} at poorly equipped airfields. Modern flight and navigation equipment, featuring five 15 by 20 cm liquid crystal display (LCD) panels built by Russia’s Aviapribor and a fly-by-wire system enable the An-148 aircraft to operate day and night, under instrument flight rules (IFR) and visual flight rules (VFR) weather conditions on high density air routes. Similar to the Boeing 737, the main landing gear rotates into {{the belly of the}} aircraft when in flight, with partial <b>doors</b> <b>covering</b> the legs, and the sides of the tires remaining exposed. Other design advantages include the high fuel-efficiency of the Motor Sich D-436-148 engines and entrance stairs that enable boarding and deboarding the aircraft without extra ground equipment.|$|R
5000|$|The Abbott Street {{elevation}} comprises a wide central {{reinforced concrete}} arched window surmounting paired timber panelled entrance doors on which are housed the Coat of Arms {{of the previous}} Bishops of Cairns. A cantilevered horizontal awning is located above the entrance <b>doors</b> <b>covering</b> a driveway, and the central window has a large reinforced concrete cross clad in ceramic tiles. The central window is flanked by brick piers with a narrower reinforced concrete arched window to either side. The three windows have been reglazed with stained/painted glass forming the commemorative [...] "Peace Window". The Abbott Street elevation is framed by wide panels of brickwork to parapet height, which are flanked by the enclosed ends of the single- storeyed side verandahs each of which have a brickwork panel separated from {{the main body of}} the Cathedral by a vertical strip of glazing. The enclosed end of the northern verandah forms the entrance to the baptistery.|$|R

5000|$|In 1999, Astbury and Duffy {{reformed}} the Cult with Matt Sorum and ex-Porno for Pyros bassist Martyn LeNoble. Their {{first official}} concert {{was at the}} Tibetan Freedom Concert in June 1999, after having rehearsed at shows in the Los Angeles area. The band's 1999 Cult Rising reunion tour resulted in a sold out 30 date tour of the US, ending with 8 consecutive sold out nights at the LA House of Blues. In 2000, the band toured South Africa for the first time, and North and South America, and contributed the song [...] "Painted on My Heart" [...] to the soundtrack of the movie Gone In 60 Seconds. The song was featured prominently and the melody was fused into parts of the score. In June, Astbury's long-delayed solo record was finally released as Spirit\Light\Speed, but it failed to gain much success. In November 2000, another authorised greatest hits compilation was released, Pure Cult: The Singles 1984-1995, along with an accompanying DVD, which was later certified gold in Canada. The Cult, as well as Ian Astbury, performed on separate tracks on the Doors tribute album, Stoned Immaculate: The Music of The <b>Doors,</b> <b>covering</b> [...] "Wild Child" [...] and [...] "Touch Me".|$|R
50|$|The {{exterior}} utilizes Indiana limestone set on {{a granite}} base in combination with aluminum spandrels. The interior doors are inlaid with white metal, with the exterior gates in bronze. Surrounding the <b>doors</b> and <b>covering</b> the walls and floors of the entrance lobby {{are a variety of}} marbles, including Belgian Black, Yellow Sienna, Tinos Greek, St. Genevieve Golden Vein, Verde Antique, and Moutonelle. Flooring above the ground level is made of terrazzo with brass strips. Bronze also makes up the frames for windows of the ground floor bank, and is used in trim throughout the building along with stainless steel.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the first}} two seasons the series {{received}} technical assistance from the California Highway Patrol. The patrol cars in early episodes are actual CHP vehicles with the show's car <b>door</b> emblem <b>covering</b> the CHP emblem (sometimes a real CHP star is briefly visible). For instance, the 1955 Buick Century two-door patrol car seen in early episodes was built exclusively for CHP. Eventually California Highway Patrol dropped its support, reportedly dissatisfied with how the show had evolved. At that point the show had to create its own patrol cars using non-police models, but still outfitted in CHP-style, distinctly subdued compared with many police agencies.|$|R
50|$|Leather, one of {{the most}} common {{materials}} available, was used for many products, including saddles, chaps, whips, window and <b>door</b> <b>coverings,</b> riatas (leather braided rope), trousers, hats, stools, chairs, bed frames, etc. Leather was even used for leather armor where soldiers' jackets were made from several layers of hardened leather sewn together. This stiff leather jacket was sufficient to stop most Indian arrows and worked well when fighting the Indians. Beef was a common constituent of most Californio meals and since it couldn't be kept long in the days before refrigeration, beef was often slaughtered to get a few steaks or cuts of meat. The property and yards around the ranchos were marked by the large number of dead cow heads, horns or other animal parts. Cow hides were kept later for trading purposes with Yankee or British traders who started showing up once or twice a year after 1825. Beef, wheat bread products, corn (maize), several types of beans, peas and several types of squash were common meal items with wine and olive oil used when they could be found. The mestizo population probably subsisted mostly on what they were used to: corn or maize, beans, and squash with some beef donated by the rancho owners. What the average Native Americans ate is unknown since they were in transition from a hunter gatherer society to agriculturalists. Formerly, many lived at least part of the year on ground acorns, fish, seeds, wild game, etc. It is known that many of the ranchers complained about Indians stealing their cattle and horses to eat.|$|R
25|$|A {{screen door}} {{can refer to}} a hinged storm door (cold climates) or hinged screen <b>door</b> (warm climates) <b>covering</b> an {{exterior}} door; or a screened sliding door used with sliding glass doors. In any case, the screen door incorporates screen mesh to block flying insects from entering and pets and small children from exiting interior spaces, while allowing for air, light, and views. The screen door was invented in 1887 by Hannah Harger.|$|R
60|$|Isbel's {{house had}} not been {{constructed}} {{with the idea of}} repelling an attack from a band of Apaches. The long living room of the main cabin was the one selected for defense and protection. This room had two windows and a door facing the lane, and a door at each end, one of which opened into the kitchen and the other into an adjoining and later-built cabin. The logs of this main cabin were of large size, and the <b>doors</b> and window <b>coverings</b> were heavy, affording safer protection from bullets than the other cabins.|$|R
