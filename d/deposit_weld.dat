Both {{are used to}} some extent for other applications and could be further developed for internal, local, structural repair of gas transmission pipelines. Preliminary test programs were developed for both <b>deposited</b> <b>weld</b> metal repair and for fiber-reinforced composite liner repair. Evaluation trials have been conducted using a modified fiber-reinforced composite liner provided by RolaTube and pipe sections without liners. All pipe section specimens failed in areas of simulated damage. Pipe sections containing fiber-reinforced composite liners failed at pressures marginally greater than the pipe sections without liners. The {{next step is to}} evaluate a liner material with a modulus of elasticity approximately 95 % of the modulus of elasticity for steel. Preliminary welding parameters were developed for <b>deposited</b> <b>weld</b> metal repair in preparation of the receipt of Pacific Gas & Electric's internal pipeline welding repair system (that was designed specifically for 559 mm (22 in.) diameter pipe) and the receipt of 559 mm (22 in.) pipe sections from Panhandle Eastern. The next steps are to transfer welding parameters to the PG&E system and to pressure test repaired pipe sections to failure. A survey of pipeline operators was conducted to better understand the needs and performance requirements of the natural gas transmission industry regarding internal repair. Completed surveys contained the following principal conclusions: (1) Use of internal weld repair is most attractive for river crossings, under other bodies of water, in difficult soil conditions, under highways, under congested intersections, and under railway crossings. (2) Internal pipe repair offers a strong potential advantage to the high cost of horizontal direct drilling (HDD) when a new bore must be created to solve a leak or other problem. (3) Typical travel distances can be divided into three distinct groups: up to 305 m (1, 000 ft.); between 305 m and 610 m (1, 000 ft. and 2, 000 ft.); and beyond 914 m (3, 000 ft.). All three groups require pig-based systems. A despooled umbilical system would suffice for the first two groups which represents 81 % of survey respondents. The third group would require an onboard self-contained power unit for propulsion and welding/liner repair energy needs. (4) Pipe diameter sizes range from 50. 8 mm (2 in.) through 1, 219. 2 mm (48 in.). The most common size range for 80 % to 90 % of operators surveyed is 508 mm to 762 mm (20 in. to 30 in.), with 95 % using 558. 8 mm (22 in.) pipe.

40|$|Fusion welding {{is common}} in steel {{pipeline}} construction in fossil-fuel power generation plants. Steel pipes in service carry steam at high temperature and pressure, undergoing creep during years of service; their integrity is critical for the safe operation of a plant. The high-grade martensitic P 92 steel is suitable for plant pipes for its enhanced creep strength. P 92 steel pipes are usually joined together with a similar weld metal. Martensitic pipes are sometimes joined to austenitic steel pipes using nickel based weld consumables. Welding involves severe thermal cycles, inducing residual stresses in the welded structure, which, without {{post weld heat treatment}} (PWHT), can be detrimental to the integrity of the pipes. Welding residual stresses can be numerically simulated by applying the finite element (FE) method in Abaqus. The simulation consists of a thermal analysis, determining the temperature history of the FE model, followed by a sequentially-coupled structural analysis, predicting residual stresses from the temperature history. In this paper, the FE thermal analysis of the arc welding of a typical P 92 pipe is presented. The two parts of the P 92 steel pipe are joined together using a dissimilar material, made of Inconel weld consumables, producing a multi-pass butt weld from 36 circumferential weld beads. Following the generation of the FE model, the FE mesh is controlled using Model Change in Abaqus to activate the weld elements for each bead at a time corresponding to weld deposition. The thermal analysis is simulated by applying a distributed heat flux to the model, the accuracy of which is judged by considering the fusion zones in both the parent pipe as well as the <b>deposited</b> <b>weld</b> metal. For realistic fusion zones, the heat flux must be prescribed in the <b>deposited</b> <b>weld</b> pass and also the adjacent pipe elements.

40|$|AbstractIn the {{regeneration}} of turbine or compressor blades each blade {{damage is}} varying in location, size and shape, {{depending on the}} cause of damage. An important regeneration step is the re-contouring which is applied after the <b>deposit</b> <b>welding</b> to remove excess material. With complex blade shapes this step requires 5 -axis machining methods. Due to different cases of damage, the re-contouring has to be adapted to each individual repair case to satisfy the high quality requirements regarding the final workpiece. This paper combines the two topics machining strategy and emerging workpiece quality. In this context the work demonstrates a simulation-based approach for the 5 -axis re-contouring process. Hence, different 5 -axis tool-paths strategies are applied on an analogy repair case including a modelled weld shape. The re-contouring is performed virtually via a dexel based material removal simulation as well as experimentally by using a 5 -axis milling machine. Afterwards {{an evaluation of the}} different tool-path strategies is done considering achieved workpiece quality. The results imply that the simulation is applicable to predict certain aspects of the workpiece quality such as surface topography.

40|$|Abstract. In harsh {{operational}} conditions, the low-alloy steels need to {{be protected}} from the environment. Thus, against corrosion and wear, an ordinary choice is metallic cladding. In this sense, the present study aimed to evaluate the properties of cobalt base superalloy coating deposited by gas tungsten welding process (GTAW) on steel SAE 4140. A circumferential weld was chosen due to its critical restraint. Four coating conditions were studied varying the welding currents. A microstructural evaluation was done using optical and scanning electron microscopy. The physical properties of coatings were additionally evaluated by microhardness measurement and dilution quantification. The results obtained indicated, for all conditions, a uniformity of layers.

40|$|In {{the first}} part of this thesis an {{overview}} of the most common Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes and a valid classification scheme outside of the classification of conventional ma-chining processes is presented. Advantages and shortcomings of these processes are briefly explained and application cases from the industry are given. Transitioning from the shortcom-ings of current Additive Manufacturing processes the so called “hybrid additive subtractive” processes are introduced. The concept, setup, and machinery of these systems are explained by the example of the Controlled Metal Build-Up (CMB) process, a hybrid additive-subtractive process developed at the Fraunhofer IPT in Aachen, Germany. Competitors as well as potential application cases are exhibited. Based on the identified lack of feasible process chains for Additive Manufactur-ing, an improved alternative process chain for the usage of the CMB process is then introduced taking automation and a broad applicability into account. In an additional part exemplary material properties of a component created with CMB are ex-amined. Based on the results of a previously created tool that was manufactured by CMB and which displays a significantly increased service time, tribological tests are conducted for differ-ent test specimens as well as for reference parts. The experiments serve to increase the applicability of the CMB process to other components and to improve the deposition strategy and material properties of the manufactured parts and thus to validate the developed process chain. The experimental design as well as the obtain-ment of results are explained in detail. It is shown, that the angularity between the line of force during the testing and the weld seam deposition direction has a significant influence on the wear behavior of the deposited material. Based on the findings it is recommended to design the deposition process in such way that the <b>deposited</b> <b>weld</b> seams are in line with the direction of force during operation. Furthermore it is shown that the chosen tribological tests only have a limited validity and cannot be transferred to the real application case, since the results of the significantly increased life time of the tool could not be reproduced. During the tests the <b>deposited</b> <b>weld</b> seam surface is not generally superior to a hardened surface, as it was previously assumed. One reason might be a failure during the hardening of the test specimens and thus undesired material properties that prevent comparability of the obtained results.

Low Transformation Temperature (LTT) alloys were {{developed}} {{in order to control}} the residual stress development by the martensitic phase transformation already during cooling of the weld metal. The positive effect of such LTT alloys on the mitigation of detrimental tensile residual stresses during welding has already been confirmed on the basis of individual laboratory tests. Within the current project it was experimentally investigated whether the phase transformation mechanisms are effective under increased restraint due to multi-pass welding of thicker specimens. The local residual stress depth distribution was analyzed non-destructively for V-type welds processed by arc welding using energy dispersive synchrotron X-ray diffraction (EDXRD). The use of high energy (20 keV to 150 keV) EDXRD allowed for the evaluation of diffraction spectra containing information of all contributing phases. As the investigated LTT alloy contains retained austenite after welding, this phase was also considered for stress analysis. The results show in particular how the constraining effect of increased thickness of the welded plates and additional <b>deposited</b> <b>weld</b> metal influences the level of the residual stresses in near weld surface areas.

The micromorphology and soil P fractions provide strong evidence for a welded soil between 3. 0 and 4. 0 m depth (L 3 b basal unit). Throughout this unit the b-fabric is both porostriated and granostriated; amorphous concentration features are moderately to strongly impregnated, postdating clay cutans.
