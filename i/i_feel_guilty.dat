[...] I don't know why. Part of it is because I choose... no, I don't choose not to be. I want to be close to them. I kind of feel uncomfortable.

2500|$|After much {{delay and}} misfortune, the show finally began its run in New York City on April 29, 2010.

Neil Genzlinger of the New York Times wrote, [...] "Should <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> that, for me, the most satisfying moment of Cirque du Soleil’s Banana Shpeel came when a clown was riddled with mock machine-gun fire?".

6000|$|Winston {{looked down}} upon her gravely, and Miss Barrington noticed a {{steadiness}} in his eyes she had not expected to see.

6000|$|He {{hesitated a}} moment, then said, with deep feeling, [...] "It's hard, it's lonely, but, after all, {{it has its}} compensations. I can see results. The worst side of it all is--I can never ask any woman to share such a life with me. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> when I {{consider}} Jennie--she {{ought to have a}} home of her own; she has no outlook here." ...|$|E
60|$|It's {{comfort and}} {{pleasure}} after all {{to have a}} good account of you both, my very dear friends, even though one knows by it that you have been sending one 'al diavolo' for weeks or months. Forgive me, do. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> somehow to the extreme degree, that four letters should have been written to me, even though I received none of them, because I ought to have written at least one letter in that time.|$|E

'Yes, mother, that's it; but it's {{all over}} and no harm done, and I think we'd better let it be, for a while at least. <b>I</b> did <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> to keep {{anything}} from you, but now {{you know so much}} I shall not worry and you needn't either. Ted's sorry, I don't mind, and it has done us both good.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Yesterday morning Aunt Martha was {{serene and}} unsuspicious. It is dreadful {{of me to}} be deceiving her and <b>I</b> do <b>feel</b> <b>guilty.</b> <b>I</b> {{sat down on the}} sand and pretended to read the [...] "Memoirs of a Missionary"--Aunt likes cheerful books like that--in an agony of anticipation. Presently Aunt said, majestically: [...] "Marguerite, there is a man coming this way. We will move further down." ...|$|R

She wrote me that she guessed she might as well; so long as she was a medium nobody else would ever want her--or something like that. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>guilty,</b> I'll admit, but you see how it was. The girl belongs to Julia, and since Clarke came into the family our correspondence has been pretty well confined to checks on my part and receipts on hers; but she's had plenty of money, professor. There wasn't any need of her going into anybody's house. She {{could have gone to}} the best hotels--" ...|$|E
6000|$|MURRAY (irritably). You make me ill {{when you}} talk that way, Eileen. It doesn't sound like you at all. What's come over you lately? Get a grip on yourself, for God's sake. I was--knocked out--when I read the note you slipped me after supper. I didn't {{get a chance to}} read it until late, I was so busy packing, and by that time you'd gone to your cottage. If I could have reached you any way I'd have refused to come here, I tell you straight. But I couldn't--and I knew you'd be here waiting--and--still, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>guilty.</b> Damn it, this isn't the thing for you! You ought to be in bed asleep. Can't you look out for yourself? ...|$|E
6000|$|Had he been {{required}} to make confession of his creed he would probably have framed it in some such way as this: [...] "I disbelieve in all Church dogmas, and {{do not go to}} church; I have no definite ideas about a future state, and do not want to have; but in a private way I try to identify myself as much as possible with what I see about me, feeling that if I could ever really be at one with the world I live in I should be happy. I think it foolish not to trust my senses and my reason; as for what my senses and my reason will not tell me, I assume that all is as it had to be, for if one could get to know the why of everything in one would be the Universe. I do not believe that chastity is a virtue in itself, but only so far as it ministers to the health and happiness of the community. I do not believe that marriage confers the rights of ownership, and I loathe all public wrangling on such matters; but I am temperamentally averse to the harming of my neighbours, if in reason it can be avoided. As to manners, I think that to repeat a bit of scandal, and circulate backbiting stories, are worse offences than the actions that gave rise to them. If I mentally condemn a person, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> of moral lapse. I hate self-assertion; I am ashamed of self-advertisement. I dislike loudness of any kind. Probably I have too much tendency to negation of all sorts. Small-talk bores me to extinction, but I will discuss a point of ethics or psychology half the night. To make capital out of a person's weakness is repugnant to me. I want to be a decent man, but--I really can't take myself too seriously." ...|$|E

You'll have ample {{time if you}} go NOW to reach the Priory for luncheon. Do, please! It would be ever so much better for everybody. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> quite <b>guilty</b> as it is, and I suppose I am already in Lord Beverdale's black books." ...|$|R
5000|$|In a January 2016 {{interview}} with CBS, Trump {{said of his}} campaign's plans to purchase advertising; [...] "I think I'm probably wasting the money. But I'm $35 million under budget. Look, I {{was going to have}} 35 or 40 million spent by now. I haven't spent anything. <b>I</b> almost <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> … I'm leading by, as you all say, a lot. You can take the CBS poll.

6000|$|My {{heart beat}} hard. I was {{face to face}} with a dilemma. These were friends of Courtenay Ivor's, and I had given myself away to them. I was going to their house, to accept their hospitality--and to betray their friend! Never in my life did <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> so <b>guilty</b> before. Oh! what on earth was I to do?

I believe <b>I</b> don't <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> for three reasons. First, we were supposed to kidnap him, not kill him. Second, I wasn't there at the moment of his death. And third, he represented repression. He was practically Somoza's second in command, the one who conducted all those murderous operations in the north, the one who massacred so many in Masaya. He really was a monster. I understood his death as part of the liberation struggle... Nora Astorga ...|$|R
