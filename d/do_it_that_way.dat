6000|$|... "We've got {{to change}} a deal yet, Mr. Finn, and we'll do it. When a young man as has liberal {{feelings}} gets into Parliament, he shouldn't be snapped up and brought into the governing business just because he's poor and wants a salary. They don't <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> in the States; and they won't <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> here long. It's the system as I hates, and not you, Mr. Finn. Well, good-bye, sir. I hope you'll like the governing business, and find it suits your health." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. PEARCE. It's no use {{talking to}} her like that, Mr. Higgins: she doesn't {{understand}} you. Besides, you're quite wrong: she doesn't <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> at all [she takes the handkerchief].|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{was well}} done, kid," [...] cried he called Pick. [...] "And {{it was well}} you <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> If you had said we were aboard you might have got a dose of lead in your head." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, bother!" [...] said I; {{and when}} I {{got into bed}} I drew the clothes {{over my head and}} sang that brave song all to myself. <b>Doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> the words and tune didn't matter at all, but I felt the spirit of <b>it,</b> and <b>that</b> was all I wanted, and then I went to sleep.|$|R
5000|$|Sonthi's {{potential}} {{entry into}} politics was welcomed by Suthep Thaugsuban, Secretary-General of the Democrat Party. [...] "It {{would be a}} good sign if Sonthi would turn himself into a politician because <b>that</b> is the <b>way</b> of democracy. We should appreciate him he <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> He is welcome... I haven't talked about the matter with him. But, in general, the Army commander-in-chief, government officials or ordinary people are welcome here at the Democrat Party," [...] Suthep said.|$|R
60|$|LEO [still in tears] I'm sure I {{never thought}} it would be so horrid for Rejjy. I offered honorably to do it myself, and let him divorce me; but he wouldnt. And he said himself that {{it was the only way}} to do it--that it was the law that he should <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> I never saw that hateful {{creature}} until that day in Court. If he had only shewn her to me before, I should never have allowed it.|$|E
6000|$|... "We do not <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> at all," [...] the man said. [...] "I have a book. It {{was given}} to me by the officer I succeeded. Here it is. You will see that he handed over so many barrels of cartridges. On one side of the page I put down the number of barrels issued, and on the other the number I receive, and thus, at any time, without {{disturbing}} the contents of the store, I can state the number of barrels it contains." ...|$|E
6000|$|Campbell: [...] "Well, a man can't <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> He {{would look}} silly." [...] He {{rises from the}} table, and comes and puts his arm round her shoulders. [...] "But you needn't be afraid of my being rough with him. Of course it's a mistake; but he's a fellow who will enter into the joke too; he'll enjoy it; he'll--" [...] He merges his {{sentence}} in a kiss on her upturned lips, and she clings to his hand with her right, pressing it fondly to her cheek. [...] "I shall {{do it in a}} man's way; but I guess you'll approve of it quite as much." ...|$|E
5000|$|It {{was a man}} and he was begging, and pleading, and praying, I guess. And he was 'Please, God'n {{all over}} the place. So I {{told him he could}} have a half an hour to pray to God and if God could come down and change the {{circumstances}}, he'd have that time. But God never showed up and he never changed the circumstances and <b>that</b> was <b>that.</b> <b>It</b> wasn't too nice. That's one thing, I shouldn't have done that one. I shouldn't have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b>|$|R
6000|$|ANNA--I'm {{coming to}} him. But you--you <b>did</b> mean <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> too. You sounded--yust {{like all the}} rest. [Hysterically.] But, damn it, shut up! Let me talk for a change! ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Well, Rose, that's the hitch. I {{had to pay}} up some bills after I got my allowance, and unluckily I {{changed my}} bicycle, and the rascals put a lot more on the new one, and I haven't got above seven pounds left, and I must keep some for the rail from New York and for getting home, for I can't take the kid home in the steerage. The bicycle's worth something, and so is my watch, if I put them in pawn; so I think I can <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> and I'm quite seaman enough to get employment, only I don't want to lose time about it.' ...|$|E
60|$|But {{they must}} breed a devil {{of a lot}} of maggots. Soil must be simply {{swirling}} with them. Your head it simply swurls. Those pretty little seaside gurls. He looks cheerful enough over it. Gives him a sense of power seeing all the others go under first. Wonder how he looks at life. Cracking his jokes too: warms the cockles of his heart. The one about the bulletin. Spurgeon went to heaven 4 a.m. this morning. 11 p.m. (closing time). Not arrived yet. Peter. The dead themselves the men anyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know what's in fashion. A juicy pear or ladies' punch, hot, strong and sweet. Keep out the damp. You must laugh sometimes so better <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> Gravediggers in Hamlet. Shows the profound knowledge of the human heart. Daren't joke about the dead for two years at least. De mortuis nil nisi prius. Go out of mourning first. Hard to imagine his funeral. Seems a sort of a joke. Read your own obituary notice they say you live longer. Gives you second wind. New lease of life.|$|E
6000|$|... "I daresay {{we shall}} fall in with some Mahdists," [...] Rupert said. [...] "I got up the maps {{thoroughly}} before I started, and specially studied the routes {{leading to the}} coast. I fancy the line we shall travel will take us down by Kassala. The Mahdists were besieging it, but I don't know whether it has fallen or not. The safest route would certainly be to go through Abyssinia, but the Arabs wouldn't like to travel that way if they could help it. There have been troubles for years between Abyssinia and the Soudan, and {{it is by no}} means certain what sort of treatment we should meet if we got there. Massowah is certainly the best place to strike for. Suakim would have been the best place in some respects, because there are lots of English there and we should have no difficulty in getting money to pay the sheiks; but after all it is only a question of a week or two's delay at the most. I have letters from my father authorizing me to draw upon him for any amount, and if we cannot get it at Massowah we shall only have to send up to the officer in command at Suakim; he would cash a draft out of the pay-chest; or if he could not <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> would get some merchant there to do it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Wagner {{wrote the}} first two parts and Grant the last two. Grant has {{said that this was}} <b>done</b> because <b>it</b> could not have been done any other way, [...] "Together with Chopper in [...] "Oz", it brought the crisis in John's and my {{partnership}} to a crescendo." [...] Concluding [...] "The only time we ever did alternate episodes was on Last American, when our partnership was teetering on its last legs anyway. If we hadn't <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> <b>it</b> still wouldn't have been published today, we argued so much about it." ...|$|R
40|$|If we ask any {{intelligent}} farmer why he {{has organized}} his farm as he has; why he is raising the crops that he raises in just the proportions that he is raising them; {{why he has}} {{as much as he}} has of each class of livestock; he is likely to tell us <b>that</b> he is <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> because he believes it will bring him more money from what he is putting into it than he could get by any other use of his land, labor, equipment and other resources...|$|R

6000|$|So {{much for}} one European fashion. Every country {{has its own}} ways. It may {{interest}} the reader {{to know how they}} [...] "put horses to" [...] on the continent. The man stands up the horses {{on each side of the}} thing that projects from the front end of the wagon, and then throws the tangled mess of gear forward through a ring, and hauls it aft, and passes the other thing through the other ring and hauls it aft on the other side of the other horse, opposite to the first one, after crossing them and bringing the loose end back, and then buckles the other thing underneath the horse, and takes another thing and wraps it around the thing I spoke of before, and puts another thing over each horse's head, with broad flappers to it to keep the dust out of his eyes, and puts the iron thing in his mouth for him to grit his teeth on, uphill, and brings the ends of these things aft over his back, after buckling another one around under his neck to hold his head up, and hitching another thing on a thing that goes over his shoulders to keep his head up when he is climbing a hill, and then takes the slack of the thing which I mentioned a while ago, and fetches it aft and makes it fast to the thing that pulls the wagon, and hands the other things up to the driver to steer with. I never have buckled up a horse myself, but I do not think we <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Most of the {{construction}} and improvement projects at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway during the Hulman years were [...] "handshake deals," [...] done without a contract. Hulman preferred to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> always pointing out that he wasn't {{in it for the}} money; he just wanted to deliver the best racing experience possible.|$|E
5000|$|... "This is a {{political}} war and it calls for discrimination in killing. The best weapon for killing would be a knife, but I'm afraid we can't <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> The worst is an airplane. The next worst is artillery. Barring a knife, the best is a rifle — you know who you're killing." ...|$|E
40|$|I {{grew up on}} a {{purebred}} operation, {{where we}} did everything the hard way. If it involved more labor, more overhead, and more inputs we <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> Calving season was of course the most labor intensive, coldest time of the year. We calved every cow through the barn and watched them around the clock. Each calf was weighed, tagged, vaccinated at birth, and not to mention probably nursed. Now we calve around 2, 500 commercial cows and sometimes we check them, {{but most of the time}} we don’t even see the calves until branding time...|$|R
2500|$|This will {{be defined}} as the [...] "we've always <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> so there's no need to ever change" [...] {{attitude}} (see appeal to tradition). An old, successful company is far more likely to have this attitude than a new, struggling one. While [...] "change for change's sake" [...] is counter-productive, refusal to consider change, even when indicated, is likewise toxic to a company, as changes in the industry and market conditions will inevitably demand changes in the firm in order to remain successful. An example is Polaroid Corporation's delay in moving into digital imaging, which adversely affected the company, ultimately leading to bankruptcy.|$|R
5000|$|... was {{travelling}} {{around all}} the time in a bus. I did that for two years after I left school, to the point where I was starting to get really good bread. But I was getting ill. So I went back to art college. And that was a total change in direction. That's why I say <b>it's</b> possible to <b>do.</b> As dedicated as I was to playing the guitar, I knew <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> was <b>doing</b> me in forever. Every two months I had glandular fever. So for the next 18 months I was living on ten dollars a week and getting my strength up. But I was still playing.|$|R
50|$|It's {{probably}} the only time we've ever made a record where it was actually finished when it was finished. Every other time you're pretty much given a month or a two month block. When that last day ticks over the record is finished; whether it's finished or not. So this was an absolutely luxury to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E

However, he claims Nathan-Turner later praised him, saying: [...] "You were absolutely right to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> - the script wasn't that good and you made something of it." ...|$|E
50|$|Contextual {{inquiry is}} a field data {{collection}} technique used to capture detailed information about how users of a product interact with the product in their normal environment. In mobile applications, a key aspect of the technique is detailed logging of their physical environment factors (factors), typically achieved by logging mobile sensor data or data from a contextual awareness SDK, combined with their in-app activity and interaction. Key takeaways from the technique are to learn what users actually do, why they <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> and when.|$|E

Just wire me the money and let me do the show." [...] And {{he was willing to}} do that. One of the reasons <b>it</b> was <b>done</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> was he only gave me $200,000 for the thing all in.

5000|$|Dylan has {{described}} {{his reaction to}} hearing Hendrixs version: [...] "It overwhelmed me, really. He had such talent, he could find things inside a song and vigorously develop them. He found things that other people wouldnt think of finding in there. He probably improved upon it by the spaces he was using. I took license with the song from his version, actually, and continue to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> to this day."In the booklet accompanying his Biograph album, Dylan said: [...] "I liked Jimi Hendrixs record of this and ever since he died Ive been <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way...</b> Strange how when I sing it, I always feel its a tribute to him {{in some kind of}} way." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{text and}} {{graphics}} screens had a complex arrangement (the scanlines were not stored in sequential areas of memory) which was reputedly due to Wozniak's realization <b>that</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> would save a chip; {{it was less}} expensive to have software calculate or look up {{the address of the}} required scanline than to include the extra hardware. Similarly, in the high-resolution graphics mode, color was determined by pixel position and could thus be implemented in software, saving Wozniak the chips needed to convert bit patterns to colors. This also allowed for sub-pixel font rendering since orange and blue pixels appeared half a pixel-width further to the right on the screen than green and purple pixels.|$|R
