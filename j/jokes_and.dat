5|$|Shakespeare wrote {{seventeen}} comedies {{that incorporate}} many techniques still used by performers and writers of comedy—such as jokes, puns, parody, wit, observational humor, or the unexpected effect of irony. One-liner <b>jokes</b> <b>and</b> satire {{are also used}} to comedic effect in literature. In farce, the comedy is a primary purpose.|$|E

The incident became the subject of a number of <b>jokes</b> <b>and</b> satire.|$|E
5|$|A running joke {{throughout}} the film series is Moneypenny's unrequited love for Bond and his playful flirting with her. She flirts back, <b>jokes</b> <b>and</b> sometimes pouts, hoping to wrangle a proposal and {{a wedding ring}} out of him. A fantasy sequence in Die Another Day marks the only occasion in the Eon film series in which Moneypenny was actually shown in a romantic embrace with Bond, although this is only in Q-branch's virtual reality machine.|$|E

5|$|Among more {{negative}} reviews include Jason Hughes of TV Squad, who commented that several jokes in the episode did not work, {{such as the}} reveal that Krusty the Clown has been sleeping with Sideshow Mel's wife for several years, though he did enjoy {{most of the other}} <b>jokes</b> <b>and</b> applauded the development of Nelson's character.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{religious}} references in the series, Nakamura stated she used only her personal knowledge and {{some aspects of}} modern society, such as yakuza and blogging, which were {{not intended to be}} critical but were added because they fit the story. Similarly, secondary characters were only introduced in the series if a chapter needed a new character to introduce a topic. The themes of the chapters were created before the situations and jokes. However, if Nakamura had a specific theme, she created several <b>jokes</b> <b>and</b> then connected them to form a story. When creating a simpler chapter as compared to the more elaborate, thematic ones, she wrote without worrying about creating <b>jokes</b> <b>and</b> situations in advance. With the help of her four assistants, on average she took between ten days and two weeks to make a complete chapter.|$|E
5|$|The Season Seven DVD {{contains}} {{a number of}} deleted scenes from this episode.

5|$|We write <b>jokes,</b> <b>and</b> {{the jokes}} are funny. With a game, the fourth, fifth, sixth, 80th, 100 millionth time you've seen that joke it becomes not funny, then you lose faith in it, {{and then you}} {{question}} it, and you go round this emotional circle...We've always liked fresh-baked stuff a little better but, with a video game, it doesn't work that way. But the game isn't just a collection of funny South Park scenes, hopefully it's more than that.|$|E
5|$|Writers Ben Elton and Richard Curtis {{wrote the}} scripts for Blackadder episodes {{separately}} using word processors and then swapped the disks containing the scripts {{for each other}} to add or remove <b>jokes</b> <b>and</b> dialogue. Curtis recalls that they stuck to a policy whereby if one removed a line for not being funny, then it was never put back.|$|E

5|$|A {{role-playing}} game, it {{centers on}} a battle system {{different from that of}} traditional games of the genre, with emphasis on timing and more elaborate attacks. The game is whimsical in tone, with various in-game <b>jokes</b> <b>and</b> comical references to the heritage of the Mario series. Superstar Saga was critically acclaimed, and IGN named it the twelfth best Game Boy Advance game of all time in their feature reflecting on the Game Boy Advance's lifespan. A remake of the game for Nintendo 3DS, Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions, was released on October 6, 2017.|$|E

She {{grew up in}} nearby Hinsdale {{with her mother and}} stepfather, and had the {{responsibility}} of taking care of four siblings due to the family's financial problems. She took comfort in a vibrant imaginary life during this time and found solace in writing.

5|$|Krusty is a {{favorite}} character {{of several of the}} original writers, many of whom related themselves to him and wanted to write the Krusty-focused episodes. Krusty was used as a chance for show business <b>jokes</b> <b>and</b> thus many of Krusty's experiences and anecdotes are based on real experiences and stories heard by the writers. He was a particular favorite of Brad Bird, who directed the first two Krusty episodes and always tried to animate a scene in every Krusty episode.|$|E
5|$|Moon {{joined his}} local Sea Cadet Corps band {{at the age}} of twelve on the bugle, but found the {{instrument}} too difficult to learn and decided to take up drums instead. He was interested in practical <b>jokes</b> <b>and</b> home science kits, with a particular fondness for explosions. On his way home from school, Moon would often go to Macari's Music Studio on Ealing Road to practise on the drums there, learning his basic skills on the instrument. He left school at age fourteen, around Easter in 1961. Moon then enrolled at Harrow Technical College; this led to a job as a radio repairman, enabling him to buy his first drum kit.|$|E
5|$|Naughty Dog based Drake's {{appearance}} and personality on daredevil Johnny Knoxville, actor Harrison Ford, and {{the heroes of}} pulp magazines, novels and films. To make him relatable, the character was dressed {{in jeans and a}} T-shirt, and given an everyman persona; he is strong-willed, and often <b>jokes</b> <b>and</b> quips. The designers focused on giving him realistic reactions to his environment; for example, he stumbles while running, barely clears objects during leaps, and recognizes the absurdity of the situations in which he finds himself.|$|E
