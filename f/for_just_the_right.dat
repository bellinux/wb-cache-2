25|$|This {{striving for}} {{perfection}} is very {{evident in his}} portrait drawings, where he searches with his brush <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> line for the sitter's profile. The critical faculty in making this choice and his perception of its potency in communicating decisively the sitter's character is a true measure of Holbein's supreme greatness as a portrait painter. Nobody has ever surpassed the revealing profile and stance in his portraits: through their telling use, Holbein still conveys across the centuries the character and likeness of his sitters with an unrivalled mastery.|$|E
500|$|For {{his work}} with the Eagles, he has been cited for his {{innovative}} mixing of drums, laboriously working {{to get the right}} microphones and placements <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> sound. Rather than recording harmony vocals individually, and mixing them together later, as was common, Szymczyk preferred to capture the Eagles singing in ensemble, often spending many hours to record each phrase [...] "just right".|$|E

2500|$|Lauren Everitt from BBC News Magazine {{commented on}} melisma used in Houston's {{recording}} and its influence. [...] "An early 'I' in Whitney Houston's 'I Will Always Love You' takes nearly six seconds to sing. In those seconds the former gospel singer-turned-pop star packs {{a series of}} different notes into the single syllable", stated Everitt. [...] "The technique is repeated throughout the song, most pronouncedly on every 'I' and 'you'. The vocal technique is called melisma, and it has inspired a host of imitators. Other artists may have used it before Houston, {{but it was her}} rendition of Dolly Parton's love song that pushed the technique into the mainstream in the 90s. [...] But perhaps what Houston nailed best was moderation." [...] Everitt said that [...] "n a climate of reality shows ripe with 'oversinging,' it's easy to appreciate Houston's ability to save melisma <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> moment." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since commencing {{his writing}} process in January 1973, Lucas had done [...] "various rewrites {{in the evenings}} after the day's work." [...] He would write four {{different}} screenplays for Star Wars, [...] "searching <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> ingredients, characters and storyline. It's always been {{what you might call}} a good idea in search of a story." [...] By May 1974, he had expanded the film treatment into a rough draft screenplay, adding elements such as the Sith, the Death Star, and a general by the name of Annikin Starkiller. He changed Starkiller to an adolescent boy, and he shifted the general into a supporting role {{as a member of a}} family of dwarfs. Lucas envisioned the Corellian smuggler, Han Solo, as a large, green-skinned monster with gills. He based Chewbacca on his Alaskan Malamute dog, Indiana (whom he would later use as namesake for his character Indiana Jones), who often acted as the director's [...] "co-pilot" [...] by sitting in the passenger seat of his car.|$|E
2500|$|The {{sequence}} of the tracks on the deeply autobiographical album correlate to the range of emotions Adele experienced after the break-up, progressing from themes of anger and bitterness, to feelings of loneliness, heartbreak and regret, and finally acceptance. The revenge song [...] "Rolling in the Deep," [...] a [...] "dark, bluesy, gospel, disco tune" [...] in the singer's own words, was written as a [...] "fuck you" [...] to her ex-lover after his disparaging remarks that she was weak and that her life without him would be [...] "boring and lonely and rubbish." [...] Opening with an understated acoustic guitar strum, the song's first lines set the foreboding tone of the album. Pounding martial beats, shuffling percussion, and piano coalesce into a dramatic, multilayered chorus over which [...] "Adele's voice ranges, dramatizing her search <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> tone and words to express her dismay that a man would dare break her heart." [...] The first single from 21, [...] "Rolling in the Deep" [...] {{is one of the}} more apparent influences of the bluesy Americana music that framed the album's sound.|$|E

Moehnke praised the alterations made from the original version, such as not needing to dismount steeds when indoors, but also noted that some elements such as mechanics surrounding Marth showed the game's age. Nishioka generally enjoyed the gameplay experience, praising the inclusion of user-friendly options, but felt that these same new additions would divide fans.|$|R

2500|$|In March 2012, Harmonix {{affirmed that}} it had no plans for a fourth major release title within the year, but was still {{strongly}} supporting the game through downloadable content through the year. By early 2013, the company stated that while they may come back to Rock Band at a future time, they were shifting resources to develop new titles, and later announced that it would discontinue its regular downloadable content for the series after providing over 275 continuous weeks of such content. Rigopulos stated at his keynote at the 2014 Penny Arcade Expo East that the studio has plans to bring Rock Band to eighth-generation consoles [...] "at some point" [...] and with [...] "guns blazing". Rigopulos states that the studio is [...] "waiting <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> moment in the new generation of consoles to bring it back". Following two sets of unexpected DLC releases in early 2015 as a survey sent to Rock Band fans, the industry started to speculate that Harmonix was looking to revive the series. Bloomberg reported that Harmonix was currently working on a new version of Rock Band for the next-generation of consoles in late February. Rock Band 4 was officially announced on March 5, 2015 at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco for release later in 2015. Only current legacy Rock Band DLC is supported in Rock Band 4 - premium content and upgrades will not transfer.|$|E

She paused, naturally, <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> flash of an instant in the arched doorway, limned against the darkness behind her, the soft glow of the indirect lighting full upon her. Graham's lips gasped apart, and remained apart, his eyes ravished with the beauty and surprise of her he had deemed so small, so fairy-like. Here was no delicate midget of a child-woman or boy-girl on a stallion, but a grand lady, as only a small woman can be grand on occasion.|$|E
60|$|This talk led to many others, {{and in the}} end it {{was decided}} that the four boys should start on the trip the week {{following}} the Fourth of July. Then commenced active preparations.

60|$|I got a {{good place}} amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munching the bread and {{watching}} the ferry-boat, and very well satisfied. And then something struck me. I says, now I reckon the widow or the parson or somebody prayed that this bread would find me, and here it has gone and done it. So there ain't no doubt {{but there is something}} in that thing --that is, there's something in it when a body like the widow or the parson prays, but it don't work for me, and I reckon it don't work <b>for</b> only <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> kind.|$|R
6000|$|So {{back and}} forth from the ground to the old nest in the tree Whitefoot hurried, and {{presently}} there was quite a pile of weed stalks and soft grass and strips of bark in the old nest. Mrs. Whitefoot joined Whitefoot in hunting <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> things, but she spent more time in arranging the material. Over that old nest she made a fine high roof. Down through the lower side she cut a little round doorway just big enough for them to pass through. Unless you happened to be underneath looking up, you never would have guessed there was an entrance at all. Inside was a snug, round room, and in this she made the softest and most comfortable of beds. As it began to look more and more like a home, Whitefoot himself became as excited and eager as Mrs. Whitefoot had been from the beginning. [...] "It certainly is going to be a fine home," [...] said Whitefoot.|$|E
6000|$|She {{had only}} two torments; the {{greatest}} of which was that she couldn't, not even once or twice, touch with him on some individual fact. She would have given anything {{to have been able}} to allude to one of his friends by name, to one of his engagements by date, to one of his difficulties by the solution. She would have given almost as much <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> chance--it would have to be tremendously right--to show him in some sharp sweet way that she had perfectly penetrated the greatest of these last and now lived with it in a kind of heroism of sympathy. He was in love with a woman to whom, and to any view of whom, a lady-telegraphist, and especially one who passed a life among hams and cheeses, was as the sand on the floor; and what her dreams desired was the possibility of its somehow coming to him that her own interest in him could take a pure and noble account of such an infatuation and even of such an impropriety. As yet, however, she could only rub along with the hope that an accident, sooner or later, might give her a lift toward popping out with something that would surprise and perhaps even, some fine day, assist him. What could people mean moreover--cheaply sarcastic people--by not feeling all that could be got out of the weather? She felt it all, and seemed literally to feel it most when she went quite wrong, speaking of the stuffy days as cold, of the cold ones as stuffy, and betraying how little she knew, in her cage, of whether it was foul or fair. It was for that matter always stuffy at Cocker's, and she finally settled down to the safe proposition that the outside element was [...] "changeable." [...] Anything seemed true that made him so radiantly assent.|$|E
