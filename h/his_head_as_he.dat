5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and John Doggett (Robert Patrick) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Mulder {{secretly}} conducts his own investigation after a man is gunned down on the White House lawn attempting to inform the President of a planned alien invasion. However, he is soon in over <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> tries to expose further evidence of colonization.|$|E
5|$|But by {{the time}} he {{captured}} the position, the rest of his company lay dead or wounded. Singh was left alone to achieve the objective assigned. He advanced towards the second Pakistani medium machine gun post. At this juncture, he was almost blinded by a grenade that blast at his face. His Sten gun ammunition had run out. Singh moved out of the trench and lobbed grenades at the next Pakistani post. Meanwhile, he jumped into another trench, and killed two Pakistani soldiers with his bayonet. Before he was able {{to move out of the}} trench, he was hit by a bullet in <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> <b>As</b> <b>he</b> succumbed to his wounds, Singh hurled a grenade into a nearby Pakistani trench.|$|E
5|$|The House of Venus, {{towards the}} eastern side of the city under a {{prominent}} cypress tree, was one of the most luxurious residences in the city. It had a set of private baths and a richly decorated interior, with fine mosaics dating from the 2nd century AD showing animal and mythological scenes. There were mosaics in seven corridors and eight rooms. The central courtyard has a fanciful mosaic depicting racing chariots in a hippodrome, drawn by teams of peacocks, geese and ducks. The mosaic of Venus for which the house is named has been removed to Tangier, but in the next-door room is a still-extant mosaic showing Diana and a companion nymph being surprised by Actaeon while bathing. Actaeon is depicted with horns beginning to sprout from <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> is transformed by the angry goddess into a stag, before being chased down and killed by his own hunting dogs. The house appears to have been destroyed some time after the city's fall around 280; a mosaic depicting Cupids feeding birds with grain has been charred by what appears to have been a fire burning directly on top of it, perhaps resulting from the building being taken over by squatters who used the mosaic as the site of a hearth.|$|E

60|$|The pessimist shook <b>his</b> <b>head</b> gloomily <b>as</b> <b>he</b> sponged Tony's face.|$|R

5|$|The {{island is}} ruled {{over by a}} king. His name is Epatiana. He is a large, ignorant-looking boy of about 18 summers, {{and is one of}} the worst rowdies on the island, and there is no power to touch him. The first time we met him he was just landing from an {{excursion}} trip to the island of Rimatara, near by. And you need not be told that I was surprised when told that he was the king of the island; for instead of being dressed in a garb of rich apparel of some kind, with a crown about his head, as I had expected, he had nothing whatever on to indicate his supreme power. His costume was composed of a red breech-clout, a red woolen shirt and upon his bare head an old dried up wreath of faded flowers, such as is worn by all rowdies. When we spoke to him about his island, he dropped <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> sat upon the sand, and blushingly answered us. We told him who we were and where we were from, saluted him and left him with very different ideas formed about the king of Rurutu, than we had before meeting him. This was the first monarch of the kind I ever saw, and the first time we were ever under the reign of a king. The island is under the French protection, still it regulates and governs its own affairs, and the French have nothing to say in that respect. The king has judges under him, who make the laws and enforce them while he is in his childhood days.|$|E
25|$|On 23 July 1997, {{at around}} 4.30 pm, a sixteen-year-old boy {{discovered}} {{the body of}} a man, lying face down, at the base of an old water tower in Keillers Park, in downtown GÃ¶teborg. Called on site, the police determined that the man had been shot twice with a pistol. The first bullet hit him in the back and went right through the heart, while the second was fired to <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> lay on the ground. A bag and a head cap were recovered beside the body.|$|E
500|$|Merrick's {{death was}} ruled {{accidental}} and the certified {{cause of death}} was asphyxia, caused by the weight of <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> lay down. Treves, who performed an autopsy on the body, said that Merrick had died of a dislocated neck. Knowing that Merrick had always slept sitting upright out of necessity, Treves {{came to the conclusion that}} Merrick must have [...] "made the experiment", attempting to sleep lying down [...] "like other people".|$|E
60|$|Wade thoughtfully nodded <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>as</b> if <b>he</b> understood, and was pondering other possibilities.|$|R
60|$|Wetzel bowed <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>as</b> perhaps <b>he</b> {{had never}} before in all his life.|$|R
60|$|Bince shook <b>his</b> <b>head</b> dubiously <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{returned}} to his own office.|$|R
500|$|Chamberlain {{was known}} by various nicknames during his {{basketball}} playing career. He hated {{the ones that}} called attention to his height such as [...] "Goliath" [...] and [...] "Wilt the Stilt", which was coined during his high school days by a Philadelphia sportswriter. He preferred [...] "The Big Dipper", which was inspired by his friends who saw him dip <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> walked through doorways. After his basketball career ended, Chamberlain played volleyball in the short-lived International Volleyball Association, was president of this organization, and is enshrined in the IVA Hall of Fame for his contributions. Chamberlain was also a successful businessman, authored several books, and appeared in the movie Conan the Destroyer. He was a lifelong bachelor, and became notorious for his claim to have had sexual intercourse {{with as many as}} 20,000 women.|$|E
500|$|Although Ocean had {{creative}} {{freedom for}} both projects, he felt more confident as a songwriter for Channel Orange and typed his lyrics on a laptop rather than composing in <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{had done for}} Nostalgia, Ultra. Since transitioning from writing for other artists, he had been influenced by his [...] "gloriously painful love life" [...] when writing songs. For his lyrics, Ocean used both his past personal experiences and imagination to compose narratives for songs. He was inspired to write the song [...] "Crack Rock" [...] by stories he heard sitting in on Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous groups mentored by his grandfather, who also dealt with substance abuse in his youth. In an interview for The Guardian, Ocean expressed uncertainty about his penchant for darker subject matter, but speculated that [...] "those were the colours I {{had to work with}} on those days. ... I mean, 'experience' is an interesting word. I just bear witness." ...|$|E
500|$|Bruegel based {{the work}} on the Biblical parable of the blind leading the blind from Matthew 15:14, in which Christ refers to the Pharisees. [...] According to art critic Margaret Sullivan, Bruegel's {{audience}} was likely as familiar with classical literature as with the Bible. Erasmus had published his Adagia two years before Bruegel's painting, and it contained the quotation [...] "" [...] ("the blind leader of the blind") by Roman poet Horace. [...] Bruegel expands the two blind men in the parable to six; they are well dressed, rather than wearing the peasant clothing that typifies his late work. [...] The first blind man's face is not visible; the second twists <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> falls, perhaps to avoid landing face-first. The shinguard-clad third man, on his toes with knees bent and face to the sky, shares a staff with the second, by which he is being pulled down. The others have yet to stumble, but the same fate seems implied.|$|E
60|$|The laborer moved <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>as</b> though <b>he</b> {{would have}} spoken, but no words came.|$|R
60|$|The {{young man}} shook <b>his</b> <b>head</b> sorrowfully, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> replied in the negative.|$|R
60|$|The {{young man}} shook <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>as</b> if <b>he</b> disowned <b>his</b> {{share in the}} {{question}} with some irritation.|$|R
60|$|The fireman shook <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{divested}} {{himself of}} his coat and neckcloth.|$|E
60|$|Albert slowly shook <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> sat on {{the side}} of the bed.|$|E
60|$|Mafuta nodded <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> spoke, and, gravely {{shouldering}} his load, marched away.|$|E
60|$|Almayer, {{his hair}} all wet and stuck to <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>as</b> if <b>he</b> had been diving, {{sat up and}} gasped.|$|R
60|$|Amadu flung <b>his</b> <b>head</b> up <b>as</b> <b>he</b> halted, and {{his eyes}} glittered when they {{fastened}} on the listener's face.|$|R
6000|$|Belding nodded <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> if <b>he</b> {{understood}} that, and {{he began}} to speak again, cut something short, then went on, hesitatingly: ...|$|R
60|$|The Baronet frowned, for George Aspel {{had smiled}} {{slightly}} and shaken <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> sat down.|$|E
60|$|But Wolfenden shook <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{stood for}} a moment upright, and looked into his mother's face.|$|E
60|$|Norgate drained his glass. Selingman {{threw back}} <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{followed}} suit, and smacked his lips appreciatively.|$|E
60|$|My father shook <b>his</b> <b>head</b> sadly <b>as</b> <b>he</b> marked <b>his</b> dusky {{face and}} laboured breathing. 'How of your soul?' he asked.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come on--never mind asking questions," [...] closing {{one eye and}} bobbing <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>as</b> if <b>he</b> did {{not wish}} the girls to hear more.|$|R
60|$|Again {{there was}} a {{cautious}} pause. Then again the man shook <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>as</b> if <b>he</b> would say nothing, but would think the more.|$|R
60|$|De Stancy shook <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{turned the}} {{painting}} before {{him a little}} further to the light.|$|E
60|$|Deacon {{could not}} speak. His throat lumped {{and he nodded}} <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> reached for the cards.|$|E
60|$|Ben said nothing, at the time, to damp her courage; but {{he shook}} <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> left the cottage.|$|E
60|$|Maxwell {{lifted the}} hat from <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>as,</b> stooping, <b>he</b> touched the olive-tinted fingers with his lips. They trembled {{a little in}} his grasp.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Who do you think,' said Riderhood, with a hitch of <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>as</b> if <b>he</b> disdainfully {{jerked the}} feint away, 'picked up the body? Guess.' ...|$|R
