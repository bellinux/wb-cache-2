5|$|Bulkers are {{designed}} to be easy to build and to store cargo efficiently. To facilitate construction, bulkers are built with a single hull curvature. Also, while a bulbous bow allows a ship to move more efficiently through the water, designers lean towards simple vertical bows on larger ships. Full hulls, with large block coefficients, are almost universal, and as a result, bulkers are inherently slow. This is offset by their efficiency. Comparing a ship's carrying capacity in terms of deadweight tonnage to its weight when empty <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> to measure its efficiency. A small Handymax ship can carry five times its weight. In larger designs, this efficiency is even more pronounced: Capesize vessels can carry more than eight times their weight.|$|E

5|$|PA 222 {{heads into}} {{downtown}} Allentown, where it splits into a one-way pair at 12th Street. Northbound PA 222 turns south onto 12th Street and east onto Walnut Street while southbound PA 222 runs west along Linden Street to 12th Street, following 12th Street south to Hamilton Street. Walnut Street is two lanes and two-way until 10th Street, where it becomes one-way with two northbound lanes heading east, while Linden Street <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> southbound with two lanes heading west. The one-way paring continues east past {{homes and businesses}} in the downtown area. Southbound PA 222 passes {{to the north of}} the PPL Center sports arena, where the Lehigh Valley Phantoms of the American Hockey League and the Lehigh Valley Steelhawks of the National Arena League play, between 8th and 7th streets. PA 222 intersects 7th Street, which carries southbound PA 145, before it reaches its northern terminus at 6th Street, which carries northbound PA 145.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{decides to}} join Mulder in the game, {{and the two}} fight Maitreya together. Maitreya begins to {{duplicate}} herself, making the task of killing her more difficult. Finally, Maitreya sits atop a virtual tank and aims it at the agents. Phoebe admits there <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> to stop the game, but doing so will erase the entire program. Despite protests from Ivan, Phoebe gives Byers the kill command, effectively destroying Maitreya along with the game while saving Mulder and Scully. During Mulder's narration, we {{see that in the}} control room one of the monitors is still active. There, Ivan sees Maitreya's avatar, but with Scully's face.|$|E

25|$|Source {{information}} is {{one type of}} episodic memory that suffers with old age; this kind of knowledge includes where and when the person learned the information.

Therefore, reliance on political stereotypes <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> to use their knowledge about the sources when making judgments, and the use of metacognitive knowledge gains importance. This deficit may be related to declines in the ability to bind information together in memory during encoding and retrieve those associations at a later time.|$|E
