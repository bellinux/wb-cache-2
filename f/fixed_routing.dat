If all of the paths fail, then the connection is blocked. If multiple paths are available, only one of them would be utilized.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Due to {{simplicity}} in lightpath service provisioning, fixed {{shortest path}} routing is {{considered as one}} of major provisioning strategies in the wavelength routed optical networks. Nonetheless, the employment of fixed shortest routes can cause unbalanced network traffic load distribution and consequentially lead to network congestion. In this paper, we propose a novel Load-Balanced <b>Fixed</b> <b>Routing</b> (LBFR) scheme that can avoid network congestion and retain the operational simplicity of <b>fixed</b> <b>routing.</b> A pre-training process based on a forecasted traffic load matrix is employed to find a (or few) fixed route(s) between each pair of nodes for lightpath service provisioning. For a wavelength path (WP) network subject to the constraint of wavelength continuity, we also develop an analytical model that can effectively estimate lightpath blocking performance under multiple fixed routes between each pair of nodes. Results show that the proposed LBFR can perform much better than traditional fixed shortest path routing in lightpath blocking, and performance improvement becomes more significant with an increasing network nodal degree.

40|$|This thesis studies {{dynamic routing}} in {{circuit-switched}} non-hierarchical networks based on learning automata algorithms. The {{application of a}} mathematical model for a linear reward penalty algorithm is explained. Theoretical results for this scheme verified by simulations shows {{the accuracy of the}} model. Using simulation and analysis, learning automata algorithms are compared to several other strategies on different networks. The implemented test networks may be classified into two groups. The first group are designed for <b>fixed</b> <b>routing</b> and in such networks <b>fixed</b> <b>routing</b> performs better than any dynamic routing scheme. It will be shown that dynamic routing strategies perform as well as <b>fixed</b> <b>routing</b> when trunk reservation is employed. The second group of networks are designed for dynamic routing and trunk reservation deteriorates the performance. Comparison of different routing algorithms on small networks designed to force dynamic routing demonstrates the superiority of automata under both normal and failure conditions. The thesis also considers the instability problem in non-hierarchical circuit-switched networks when dynamic routing is implemented. It is shown that trunk reservation prevents instability and increases the carried load at overloads. Finally a set of experiments are performed on large networks with realistic capacity and traffic matrices. Simulation and analytic results show that dynamic routing outperforms <b>fixed</b> <b>routing</b> and trunk reservation deteriorates the performance at low values of overload. At high overloads, optimization of trunk reservation is necessary for this class of networks. Comparison results show the improved performance with automata schemes under both normal and abnormal traffic conditions.

Using detailed experimental studies, we describe three challenges that cause existing collection protocols to have poor reliability and waste energy: inaccuracies in link estimation, link dynamics, and transient loops. In this paper we present CTP, a robust, efficient, and hardware-independent collection protocol. CTP uses three novel techniques to address these challenges. CTP’s link estimator addresses the inaccuracies in link estimation by using feedback from both the data and control planes, using information from multiple layers through narrow, platformindependent interfaces. Second, CTP addresses link dynamics by using the Trickle algorithm for control traffic, sending few beacons in stable topologies yet quickly adapting to changes. Finally, CTP addresses transient loops by using data traffic as active topology probes, quickly discovering and <b>fixing</b> <b>routing</b> failures.
