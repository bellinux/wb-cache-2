40|$|The {{objective}} of the research in this thesis was to investigate two aspects of the de-agglomeration of cohesive materials in respiratory delivery, i. e. the influence of cohesive material properties {{and the influence of}} the inhaler device characteristics. Firstly, the thesis focussed on the characterisation of cohesive powder behaviour during aerosolisation at a sequence of air flow rates to understanding the micro-structure of the powder bed. This part of the thesis determined the relative de-agglomeration as a function of air flow rate of micronized drugs, in particular salbutamol sulphate (SS) and various lactoses using a simple powder inhaler device. The study was extended to the investigation of the de-agglomeration efficiencies of binary mixtures of SS and lactohale 300 (LH 300) in the ratios of SS:LH 300 of 1 : 1, 1 : 2, 1 : 4 and 1 : 8. The data were modelled using non-linear least square regression and sigmoidal equation parameters were used to characterise single components and binary mixtures. Secondly, the thesis determined to correlate kinetics of emptying and kinetics of de-agglomeration for the powders aerosolised from inhaler devices. This second part of the thesis investigated the kinetics of powder emptying and de-agglomeration of single component systems using three model inhaler devices, Rotahaler® (RH), Monodose Inhaler® (MI) and Handihaler® (HH). The study correlated the rate constants for emptying and de-agglomeration for the powders aerosolised from inhaler devices. Due to the differences in inhaler design, the role of pressure drop across the device and sensitivity of the device on powder de-agglomeration was also studied. The primary particle size distribution of the materials was achieved through wet dispersion of powders using laser diffraction. The powders (single components and binary mixtures) were processed with a validated laboratory mixing technique prior to aerosolisation. The content uniformity of binary mixtures was assessed using a validated UV spectrophotometric assay. The real time particle size distributions of the aerosolised plume were obtained using laser diffraction following aerosolisation from inhaler devices at various air flow rates (30 - 180 l min- 1). The in-vitro performance of SS-LH 300 mixtures were assessed using custom-made jet diameters of stage 1 of the twin stage liquid impinger with drug assayed by a validated HPLC assay. <b>Images</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>powders</b> were captured using scanning electron microscopy. The significance (p< 0. 05) was obtained from ANOVA and t-test using SPSS software. Relative de-agglomeration vs. air flow rate profiles of SS and LH 300 and the estimated parameters obtained from modelling with sigmoid three parameter equation defined comparative powder micro-structures of cohesive powders. The maximum relative de-agglomeration of SS was much higher than LH 300 at higher air flow rates. In contrast, the relative de-agglomeration of LH 300 was higher than SS at low air flow rates. The de-agglomeration vs. air flow rate profiles of cohesive mixtures of SS and LH 300 demonstrated improved powder de-agglomeration with increased content of LH 300 in SS-LH 300 binary mixtures. The study showed that the cohesive materials did not behave independently and that the particle interactions occurring in the powder bed resulted in SS rich and SS poor regions of the aerosolised plume depending on the air flow rate. The parameters obtained from sigmoid three parameter equation provided an understanding of structural changes of binary mixtures (SS and LH 300) and SS with increased proportion of LH 300 in the mixture. Prolonged powder emptying was observed with inhaler devices, MI and HH in contrast to RH where powder emptied within a second. The emitted mass vs. time profiles were modelled using a mono-exponential equation to estimate the rate constant of powder emptying (kCCEM). In general, with both materials, the relative kCCEM followed the order: MI<HH<RH. However, the kCCEM between the materials depended on powder micro-structure of the materials. Similar to kCCEM, the rate of de-agglomeration (kd) from the three inhaler devices followed first-order kinetics. The rate constants i. e., kCCEM and kd were influenced by air flow rate, micro-structure of powder bed and device design. Profiles of kCCEM vs. kd resulted in linear relations for MI and HH where the slopes were 1. 0 and 0. 8 for MI and HH respectively. The capsule characteristics are very important in controlling kCCEM and kd, while the variability in kCCEM and kd was due to the design of the capsule chamber. The relative de-agglomeration as a function of pressure drop between the materials depended on the inhaler device; however; at 4 kPa pressure drop, the mechanism imparted by MI was more efficient in de-agglomerating both materials. The device sensitivity to pressure drop depended on the micro-structure of the powder. The outcomes of this thesis provided an approach to characterise the cohesive powders enabling a better understanding of micro-structures of the cohesive powders for inhalation. In addition, this study provided a way to define emptying and de-agglomeration rate of powders from inhalers to enable the use these rate constants to study both powder and device characteristics in improving inhaler design to achieve better and more reliable performance...|$|E

40|$|Wet {{agglomeration}} {{is achieved}} by adding a liquid in an agitated <b>powder</b> mixture. <b>The</b> liquid is often pure water or a dispersion of a solid binder (typically a polymer) in water to enhance the agglomeration between particles. The process is carried out in a granulator, {{which is designed to}} obtain a good contact between solid and liquid. Monitoring the agglomeration process and study <b>the</b> kinetics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process are necessary to understand <b>the</b> basic mechanisms <b>of</b> agglomeration. A way to perform this tasks is <b>the</b> direct observation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> granules growth with a sensor that takes digital <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>powder</b> bed during all the process. Images can then be processed by digital image analysis to obtain information about granules size. In particular texture analysis (TA) can be an interesting tool since image texture contains the information on the granules size. In particular from <b>the</b> histograms <b>of</b> grey levels intensities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>images</b> it is possible to get information on the contrast which is related to <b>the</b> average size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> granules. In this work texture analysis was used in order to study <b>the</b> granulation kinetics <b>of</b> a system constituted by cellulose microcrystalline (MCC) and xanthan gum (XG). In particular XG has been added in two different ways: as liquid (pre-dispersed in the water) or as solid (pre-mixed in the MCC). Granulation experiments were performed in an orbital mixer. The experiments have shown that, to obtain granules with the same size, a much larger amount of XG (up to 10 time) was required when pre-mixed in solid form. From kinetics analysis it appeared that the growth was also faster in this case even if with an initial delay, probably due to <b>the</b> hydration time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polymer. Solid binder hydration indeed is a missing step in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> pre-dispersion in water. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> larger amount <b>of</b> solid binder when pre-mixed in MCC, the final granules were also mechanically more stable and a good agreement between texture analysis and sieve analysis was always found independently <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liquid binder addition rates. Instead in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> XG pre-dispersed in water the agreement between TA and sieving was found only for high binder addition rates, suggesting that with low XG amount the binder addition rate can impact on <b>the</b> strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> final granules as can be deduced by the final PSDs which resulted modified by the sieving operation...|$|R

40|$|The {{selective}} laser sintering (SLS) is an additive manufacturing technique, which allows <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> three-dimensional objects layer by layer with even very complex geometry. It is based on <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> sintering with a laser beam selectively particles arranged on a floor layer. Layer by layer is possible produce solid forms of even very complex geometry. The granular material used in this process must have well-defined characteristics, in particular, must be capable of forming a thin and homogeneous layer of about 100 microns. The main factors which determine <b>the</b> ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> particles used to form relatively homogeneous layers are: the average diameter, the shape and the interparticle forces [1], which directly or indirectly define <b>the</b> flow properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>powder</b> used to form the layers. <b>The</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spread <b>powder</b> layer in each cycle depends on the procedure followed and the numerous techniques used to measure <b>the</b> <b>powder</b> flowability adopt measuring conditions which {{are very different from}} those occurring during the layer formation in LS [2 - 3]. This paper proposes a characterization technique of powder quality for SLS application by using a set up that mimics the movements in an SLS apparatus (Figure 1). A roller is used to spread <b>the</b> <b>powder.</b> It works by advancing against a pile <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>powder.</b> <b>The</b> set up allows to independently control and the advancement and rotation speed. <b>The</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> produced <b>powder</b> layer is characterized by means of a linear laser beam scanning its surface. In particular, <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> laser beam projected on the surface is analyzed in order to obtain a quality index indicating <b>the</b> homogeneity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>powder</b> formed layers. <b>The</b> values <b>of</b> this quality index are compared to <b>the</b> flow properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material measured with standard technologies...|$|R

Large specific surface area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>powder</b> {{in combination with}} often alloying with oxygen sensitive elements results in oxidation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>powder</b> surface in most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cases. The information about surface chemistry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>powder</b> is <b>of</b> vital importance for further consolidation and sintering steps. Surface sensitive analytical techniques – X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and high-resolution scanning electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (HR SEM+EDX) were used for surface chemical analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 60 Cu- 40 Sn bronze <b>powder.</b> Determination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> compositional profiles and estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface oxide layer thickness was done by altering of ion etching and XPS analysis.

40|$|Purpose: To {{develop an}} {{improved}} mathematical model for <b>the</b> prediction <b>of</b> dose accuracy of Dosators - based upon <b>the</b> geometry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> machine {{in conjunction with}} measured flow properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>powder.</b> Methods: A mathematical model has been created, based on a analytical method of differential slices - incorporating measured flow properties. The key flow properties {{of interest in this}} investigation were: flow function, effective angle of wall friction, wall adhesion, bulk density, stress ratio K and permeability. To simulate the real process and (very importantly) validate the model, a Dosator test-rig has been used to measure the forces acting on the Dosator during the filling stage, the force required to eject the dose and the dose weight. Results: Preliminary results were obtained from the Dosator test-rig. Figure 1 [Omitted] shows the dose weight for different depths to <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>powder</b> bed at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stroke and different levels <b>of</b> pre-compaction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>powder</b> bed. A strong influence over dose weight arising from the proximity between the Dosator and <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>powder</b> bed at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stroke and <b>the</b> conditions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>powder</b> bed has been established. Conclusions: The model will provide a useful tool to predict dosing accuracy and, thus, optimise <b>the</b> future design <b>of</b> Dosator based equipment technology – based on measured bulk properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>powder</b> to be handled. Another important factor (with a significant influence) on Dosator processes, is <b>the</b> condition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>powder</b> bed and <b>the</b> clearance between the Dosator and <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>powder</b> bed...|$|R
