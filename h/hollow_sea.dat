5000|$|Hanley {{experienced}} both World Wars. He {{served in}} the merchant navy during World War I from early in 1915 until he deserted to join the Canadian Army late April 1917. He was demobilized in the Spring of 1919. Hanley only briefly experienced frontline conflict in 1918 and was soon after invalided out. He was also in London {{at the beginning of}} the World War II during the Blitz of 1940-1. Hanley deals with his First World War experiences, on the battlefield, in his novella, The German Prisoner, and his experience in the merchant navy, on a ship commandeered by the British Admiralty to serve as a troopship, in works like the novella [...] "Narrative" [...] (1931), and his novel The <b>Hollow</b> <b>Sea</b> (1938). These experiences are also dealt with in Hanley's non-fiction work, Broken Water: An Autobiographical Excursion (1937). He uses both his earlier merchant navy experience, as well as the Blitz, in subsequent novels and short stories in the 1940s and 1950s. The Hanleys left Wales in July 1939 and led [...] "an unsettled, almost nomadic existence" [...] part of which was spent in London, and, while living in Chelsea, in August 1940 they [...] "experienced the Blitz at first hand". Finally, January 1941, they returned to Wales, taking up residence in Llanfechain, Powys.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} investigation of unique ZnO nanostructures grown in thermal oxidation, low-temperature oxygen injection CVD, and a new, low-cost and robust method of hybridizing ZnO nanostructures on carbon fiber through combustion synthesis. This new method will lead to novel multifunctional composites because ZnO nanostructures have unique piezoelectric and photoelectrochemical properties. This work first investigated ZnO nanostructure growth mechanisms through vacuum thermal oxidation and CVD experiments. Through thermal oxidation, unique hollow structures were developed under substrate heating, demonstrating ZnO nanostructures growth through diffusion mechanisms. In the low-temperature oxygen fed CVD, many ZnO nanostructures including nanosheets, tetrapods could be consistently grown by stabilizing Zn vapor pressure and controlling the oxygen flow. This would prevent premature oxidation at lower temperatures before Zn and oxygen could deposit into ZnO nanostructures. The second part of this work, investigated zinc combustion for ZnO nanostructure synthesis. It {{was found that the}} combustion reaction is affected by the amount of zinc precursor concentration and the heat transfer rate. The greater amount of zinc precursor requires a lower heat transfer rate to initiate the combustion process. Upon a sufficient heat transfer, combustion will occur. If the heat transfer rate is too low, no combustion occurs. Near the minimum heat transfer rate, the reaction is considered metastable. The results of the reaction were characterized through SEM, TEM, and XRD. Various ZnO nanostructures such as tetrapods, sheets, nanowires, and <b>hollow</b> <b>sea</b> urchins were observed for the combustion reaction, metastable reaction, and the non-combusted reaction. The nanostructures found in this system were match to similar ZnO nanostructures found in the thermal oxidation and CVD experiments. Based on the similarity, ZnO nanostructure growth mechanisms were proposed for the combustion process. ZnO nanostructures hybridized on the carbon fiber grow through deposition and diffusion mechanisms. The nanostructures' growths were affected by the heat transfer rate and oxygen availability. Finally, a composite with piezoelectric response has been constructed and demonstrated. Upon mechanical deflection, the composite produced a voltage response of 0. 1 V. The carbon fiber hybridized with ZnO nanostructures preliminary results enable further development of multifunctional composites having sensing, damping, and energy harvesting capabilities...|$|E

60|$|They made a last effort, {{the boat}} slid clear.

60|$|The oars dipped again, and {{in another}} minute the sea that came up behind them hove them high and broke into a little spout of foam.

40|$|TiO(2) <b>hollow</b> {{microspheres}} with <b>sea</b> urchin-like hierarchical architectures were synthesized by {{a simple}} hydrothermal method. The as-synthesized hollow microspheres with hierarchical architectures consisting of many rhombic building units exhibit high specific surface area. Electrorheological (ER) properties of hierarchical hollow TiO(2) -based suspension were investigated under steady and oscillatory shear. The hollow TiO(2) -based suspensions show much higher yield stress and elasticity than pure TiO(2) suspension at the same electric field strength. This phenomenon was elucidated well in view of their dielectric spectra analysis. The sea urchin-like architectures result in stronger interfacial polarization of hollow TiO(2) suspension upon an electric field, showing higher ER activity. Also, hollow interiors of TiO(2) particles increase the long-term stability of suspensions and further merit the ER effect...|$|R

5000|$|Spicara maena is a gregarious {{fish that}} moves {{in schools and}} feeds on small benthic {{invertebrates}} [...] and zooplankton. It is a protogynous hermaphrodite, starting life as a female and later changing into a male. In {{a study in the}} Gulf of İzmir in the Aegean Sea by Soykan and colleagues it was found that there are almost five times as many females as males and that the change of sex on average takes place within the length range 14.5 to 15 cm and that all fish longer than 18 cm are male. A study off the eastern central coast of the Adriatic Sea by Dulčić and colleagues found that the sex conversion on average happened between 17.5 and 18 cm and that any fish longer than 19.8 cm were male. The females become mature at the age of two years and spawning takes place between March and June in the Aegean, and between August and October further west in the Mediterranean.

40|$|Large {{amounts of}} {{detached}} Antarctic macroalgae accumulate in <b>hollows</b> of the <b>seabed,</b> where decomposition {{rates of the}} detached macroalgae {{are expected to be}} low, caused by lack of contact of the major part of the macroalgae with the sediment. To determine decomposition rates in Antarctic waters, untreated and pre-killed Desmarestia anceps fronds contained in nylon net bags were studied for 10 months under natural conditions in Factory Cove, Signy Island. Physical decomposition was shown to be more important than microbial decomposition. A weight loss of 40 % occurred in untreated material within 313 days, while prekilled material almost all disappeared within 90 days. Despite the weight loss, changes in chlorophyll a content were negligible during the experiment. Changes in the C:N ratio and tissue N indicated low rates of microbial decomposition. Therefore, it was concluded that weight loss was mainly caused by fragmentation, and particles disappearing from the nets accounted for most of the loss of original tissue. It remains unknown as to how long nutrients stay in Antarctic macroalgal litter before they become available to the system.

60|$|It {{was soon}} {{found that the}} boats had so little hold of the water that the wind and oars {{combined}} carried them forward so fast as to decrease considerably the danger of being whelmed by a falling wave. These waves increased every moment in size, and their crests were so broken and cut off by the gale that the three boats, instead of appearing as they had hitherto done the only solid objects in the scene, were almost lost to sight in the chaos of black waves and driving foam. Although they tried their best to keep close together they failed, and each soon became ignorant {{of the position of}} the others. The last that they saw of Alf's boat was in the <b>hollow</b> between two <b>seas</b> like a vanishing cormorant or a northern diver. Leo was visible some time longer. He was wielding the steering-oar in an attitude of vigorous caution, while his Eskimos were pulling as if for their lives. An enormous wave rose behind them, curled over their heads and appeared ready to overwhelm them, but the sturdy rowers sent the boat forward, and the broken crest passed under them. The next billow was still larger. Taken up though he was with his own boat the Captain found time to glance at them with horror.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a slight}} uphill climb, for the {{foresail}} peaked high; and the halyards, running through various blocks on the gaff and mast, gave him separate holds for hands and feet. But the trouble lay in that the wind was not strong enough nor steady {{enough to keep the}} sail full. When he was half-way out, the Ghost took a long roll to windward and back again into the <b>hollow</b> between two <b>seas.</b> Harrison ceased his progress and held on tightly. Eighty feet beneath, I could see the agonized strain of his muscles as he gripped for very life. The sail emptied and the gaff swung amid-ships. The halyards slackened, and, though it all happened very quickly, I could see them sag beneath the weight of his body. Then the gag swung to the side with an abrupt swiftness, the great sail boomed like a cannon, and the three rows of reef-points slatted against the canvas like a volley of rifles. Harrison, clinging on, made the giddy rush through the air. This rush ceased abruptly. The halyards became instantly taut. It was the snap of the whip. His clutch was broken. One hand was torn loose from its hold. The other lingered desperately for a moment, and followed. His body pitched out and down, but in some way he managed to save himself with his legs. He was hanging by them, head downward. A quick effort brought his hands up to the halyards again; but he was a long time regaining his former position, where he hung, a pitiable object.|$|R

60|$|When water, not in {{very great}} body, {{runs in a}} rocky bed much {{interrupted}} by hollows, {{so that it can}} rest every now and then in a pool as it goes along, it does not acquire a continuous velocity of motion. It pauses after every leap, and curdles about, and rests a little, and then goes on again; and if in this comparatively tranquil and rational state of mind it meets with an obstacle, as a rock or stone, it parts on each side of it with a little bubbling foam, and goes round; if it comes to a step in its bed, it leaps it lightly, and then after a little plashing at the bottom, stops again to take breath. But if its bed be on a continuous slope, not much interrupted by hollows, so that it cannot rest, or if its own mass be so increased by flood that its usual resting-places are not sufficient for it, but that it is perpetually pushed out of them by the following current, before it has had time to tranquillize itself, it of course gains velocity with every yard that it runs; the impetus got at one leap is carried to the credit of the next, until the whole stream becomes one mass of unchecked, accelerating motion. Now when water in this state comes to an obstacle, it does not part at it, but clears it, like a racehorse; {{and when it comes to}} a hollow, it does not fill it up and run out leisurely at the other side, but it rushes down into it and comes up again on the other side, as a ship into the <b>hollow</b> of the <b>sea.</b> Hence the whole appearance of the bed of the stream is changed, and all the lines of the water altered in their nature. The quiet stream is a succession of leaps and pools; the leaps are light and springy, and parabolic, and make a great deal of splashing when they tumble into the pool; then we have a space of quiet curdling water, and another similar leap below. But the stream when it has gained an impetus takes the shape of its bed, never stops, is equally deep and equally swift everywhere, goes down into every hollow, not with a leap, but with a swing, not foaming, nor splashing, but in the bending line of a strong sea-wave, and comes up again on the other side, over rock and ridge, with the ease of a bounding leopard; if it meet a rock three or four feet above the level of its bed, it will neither part nor foam, nor express any concern about the matter, but clear it in a smooth dome of water, without apparent exertion, coming down again as smoothly on the other side; the whole surface of the surge being drawn into parallel lines by its extreme velocity, but foamless, except in places where the form of the bed opposes itself at some direct angle to such a line of fall, and causes a breaker; so that the whole river has the appearance of a deep and raging sea, with this only difference, that the torrent-waves always break backwards, and sea-waves forwards. Thus, then, in the water which has gained an impetus, we have the most exquisite arrangements of curved lines, perpetually changing from convex to concave, and vice versa, following every swell and hollow of the bed with their modulating grace, and all in unison of motion, presenting perhaps the most beautiful series of inorganic forms which nature can possibly produce; for the sea runs too much into similar and concave curves with sharp edges, but every motion of the torrent is united, and all its curves are modifications of beautiful line.|$|R
60|$|Let the reader, then, betake {{himself in}} the spirit we have {{recommended}} {{to some of the}} quieter kinds of English landscape. In those homely and placid agricultural districts, familiarity will bring into relief many things worthy of notice, and urge them pleasantly home to him by a sort of loving repetition; such as the wonderful life-giving speed of windmill sails above the stationary country; the occurrence and recurrence of the same church tower {{at the end of one}} long vista after another: and, conspicuous among these sources of quiet pleasure, the character and variety of the road itself, along which he takes his way. Not only near at hand, in the lithe contortions with which it adapts itself to the interchanges of level and slope, but far away also, when he sees a few hundred feet of it upheaved against a hill and shining in the afternoon sun, he will find it an object so changeful and enlivening that he can always pleasurably busy his mind about it. He may leave the river-side, or fall out of the way of villages, but the road he has always with him; and, in the true humour of observation, will find in that sufficient company. From its subtle windings and changes of level there arises a keen and continuous interest, that keeps the attention ever alert and cheerful. Every sensitive adjustment to the contour of the ground, every little dip and swerve, seems instinct with life and an exquisite sense of balance and beauty. The road rolls upon the easy slopes of the country, like a long ship in the <b>hollows</b> of the <b>sea.</b> The very margins of waste ground, as they trench a little farther on the beaten way, or recede again to the shelter of the hedge, have something of the same free delicacy of line—of the same swing and wilfulness. You might think for a whole summer’s day (and not have thought it any nearer an end by evening) what concourse and succession of circumstances has produced the least of these deflections; and it is, perhaps, just in this that we should look for the secret of their interest. A foot-path across a meadow—in all its human waywardness and unaccountability, in all the grata protervitas of its varying direction—will always be more to us than a railroad well engineered through a difficult country. {231} No reasoned sequence is thrust upon our attention: we seem to have slipped for one lawless little moment out of the iron rule of cause and effect; and so we revert at once to some of the pleasant old heresies of personification, always poetically orthodox, and attribute a sort of free-will, an active and spontaneous life, to the white riband of road that lengthens out, and bends, and cunningly adapts itself to the inequalities of the land before our eyes. We remember, as we write, some miles of fine wide highway laid out with conscious æsthetic artifice through a broken and richly cultivated tract of country. It is said that the engineer had Hogarth’s line of beauty in his mind as he laid them down. And the result is striking. One splendid satisfying sweep passes with easy transition into another, and there is nothing to trouble or dislocate the strong continuousness of the main line of the road. And yet there is something wanting. There is here no saving imperfection, none of those secondary curves and little trepidations of direction that carry, in natural roads, our curiosity actively along with them. One feels at once that this road has not has been laboriously grown like a natural road, but made to pattern; and that, while a model may be academically correct in outline, it will always be inanimate and cold. The traveller is also aware of a sympathy of mood between himself and the road he travels. We have all seen ways that have wandered into heavy sand near the sea-coast, and trail wearily over the dunes like a trodden serpent. Here we too must plod forward at a dull, laborious pace; and so a sympathy is preserved between our frame of mind and the expression of the relaxed, heavy curves of the roadway. Such a phenomenon, indeed, our reason might perhaps resolve with a little trouble. We might reflect that the present road had been developed out of a tract spontaneously followed by generations of primitive wayfarers; and might see in its expression a testimony that those generations had been affected at the same ground, one after another, in the same manner as we are affected to-day. Or we might carry the reflection further, and remind ourselves that where the air is invigorating and the ground firm under the traveller’s foot, his eye is quick to take advantage of small undulations, and he will turn carelessly aside from the direct way wherever there is anything beautiful to examine or some promise of a wider view; so that even a bush of wild roses may permanently bias and deform the straight path over the meadow; whereas, where the soil is heavy, one is preoccupied with the labour of mere progression, and goes with a bowed head heavily and unobservantly forward. Reason, however, will not carry us the whole way; for the sentiment often recurs in situations where it is very hard to imagine any possible explanation; and indeed, if we drive briskly along a good, well-made road in an open vehicle, we shall experience this sympathy almost at its fullest. We feel the sharp settle of the springs at some curiously twisted corner; after a steep ascent, the fresh air dances in our faces as we rattle precipitately down the other side, and we find it difficult to avoid attributing something headlong, a sort of abandon, to the road itself.|$|R
