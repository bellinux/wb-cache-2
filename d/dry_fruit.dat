25|$|Outside Japan (as well as {{recently}} in Japan), {{there are many}} nontraditional and fusion uses of tempura. Chefs over the world include tempura dishes on their menus, and {{a wide variety of}} different batters and ingredients are used, including the nontraditional broccoli, zucchini, asparagus and chuchu. More unusual ingredients may include nori slices, <b>dry</b> <b>fruit</b> such as banana, and ice cream (tempura-based fried ice cream). American restaurants are known to serve tempura in the form of various meats, particularly chicken, and cheeses, usually mozzarella. A variation is to use panko (breadcrumbs), which results in a crisper consistency than tempura batter. Using panko in Japan would no longer qualify the dish as tempura. It would become something else called fry or pronounced in Japanese as furai. Tempura (particularly shrimp) is often used as a filling in makizushi. A more recent variation of tempura sushi has entire pieces of sushi being dipped in batter and tempura-fried.|$|E
500|$|Banksiamyces is a genus of {{fungi in}} the order Helotiales, with a {{tentative}} placement in the family Helotiaceae. The genus contains four species, which grow on the seed follicles of the dead infructescences or [...] "cones" [...] of various species of Banksia, a genus in the plant family Proteaceae endemic to Australia. Fruit bodies of the fungus appear as small (typically less than 10mm diameter), shallow dark cups on the follicles of the Banksia fruit. The edges of <b>dry</b> <b>fruit</b> bodies fold inwards, appearing like narrow slits. The first specimens of Banksiamyces, known then as Tympanis toomansis, were described in 1887. Specimens continued to be collected occasionally for almost 100 years before becoming examined more critically in the early 1980s, leading {{to the creation of}} a new genus to contain what was determined to be three distinct species, B.katerinae, B.macrocarpus, and B.toomansis. A fourth species, B.maccannii, was added in 1984.|$|E

Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to compare fresh <b>fruits</b> and <b>dried</b> <b>fruits</b> on measures of health, convenience and consumer feelings. An on-line questionnaire that measured consumers' perceptions of the health benefits and convenience characteristics and their feelings about the consumption of both fresh fruits (apples and plums) and <b>dried</b> <b>fruits</b> (e. g., raisins, dates, and apricots) was completed by 693 respondents (Polish, French, and Dutch).

500|$|Astraeus hygrometricus is an ectomycorrhizal fungus {{and grows}} in {{association}} with {{a broad range of}} tree species. The mutualistic association between tree roots and the mycelium of the fungus helps the trees extract nutrients (particularly phosphorus) from the earth; in exchange, the fungus receives carbohydrates from photosynthesis. In North America, associations with oak and pine are usual, while in India, it has been noted to grow commonly with chir pine (Pinus roxburghii) and sal (Shorea robusta). The false earthstar is found on the ground in open fields, often scattered or in groups, especially in nutrient-poor, sandy or loamy soils. It has also been reported to grow on rocks, preferring acid substrates like slate and granite, while avoiding substrates rich in lime. In Nepal, fruit bodies have been collected at elevations of [...] Fruit bodies typically appear in autumn, although the <b>dry</b> <b>fruit</b> bodies are persistent and may last up to several years. Gelatinipulvinella astraeicola is a leotiaceous fungus with minute, gelatinous, pulvinate (cushion-shaped) apothecia, known to grow only on the inner surface of the rays of dead Astraeus species, including A.hygrometricus.|$|E
500|$|Young {{specimens}} of A.hygrometricus have roughly spherical fruit bodies that typically start their development partially {{embedded in the}} substrate. A smooth whitish mycelial layer covers the fruit body, and may be partially encrusted with debris. As the fruit body matures, the mycelial layer tears away, and the outer tissue layer, the exoperidium, breaks open in a star-shaped (...) pattern to form 4–20 irregular [...] "rays". This simultaneously pushes the fruit body above ground to reveal a round spore case enclosed in a thin papery endoperidium. The rays open and close in response to levels of moisture in the environment, opening up in high humidity, and closing when the air is dry. This is possible because the exoperidium is made of several different layers of tissue; the innermost, fibrous layer is hygroscopic, and curls or uncurls the entire ray as it loses or gains moisture from its surroundings. This adaptation enables the fruit body to disperse spores at times of optimum moisture, and reduce evaporation during dry periods. Further, <b>dry</b> <b>fruit</b> bodies with the rays curled up may be readily blown about by the wind, allowing them to scatter spores from the pore as they roll.|$|E
500|$|Cortinarius iodes is {{a fairly}} {{distinctive}} species and its combination of characteristics make it readily identifiable. Several other Cortinarius species have evolved a slimy coating that probably help protects the fruit bodies from predation by insects and other invertebrates. Other field techniques {{can be used to}} help identify <b>dry</b> <b>fruit</b> bodies that have lost their slime coat: by checking for leaf and twig debris adhering to the surface, or, by kissing the cap and stem to exploit the lips' enhanced sensitivity to stickiness. C.iodeoides is virtually identical in appearance to C.iodes, but can be distinguished from the latter by its bitter-tasting cap cuticle and smaller, narrower spores measuring 7.7–9.3 by 4.6–5.4μm. The [...] "violet cort" [...] (Cortinarius violaceus) has a dry, scaly, dark purple cap and stem. The [...] "pungent cort" [...] (Cortinarius traganus) has a dry, light purple cap and stem and a bad odor. Two other widespread Cortinarius species with violet coloring and a slimy cap, C.salor and C.croceocaeruleus, can be distinguished from C.iodes by the absence of yellowish spotting. A North American species C.oregonensis has a paler lilac cap with a central region that is yellowish or brownish, and smaller spores that measure 7–8 by 4–5μm. A non-Cortinarius lookalike, Inocybe lilacina, has a dry, silky cap that features a prominent umbo.|$|E

Traditional <b>dried</b> <b>fruits</b> such as raisins, figs, dates, apricots and prunes have been a staple of Mediterranean diets for millennia. The Mediterranean region is very favourable for production of <b>dried</b> <b>fruits,</b> not only with its climatic conditions, but also its exceptional fertile lands.

Today, <b>dried</b> <b>fruit</b> consumption is widespread. Nearly half of the <b>dried</b> <b>fruits</b> sold throughout the world are raisins, followed by dates, prunes (dried plums), figs, apricots, peaches, apples and pears. Dates, prunes, apricots, figs and raisins are the major <b>dried</b> <b>fruits</b> produced in the Mediterranean area. <b>Dried</b> <b>fruits</b> are not perishable but can support mold growth, some of which can produce mycotoxins.

The health promoting ability of the fruits {{might be related to}} antioxidant properties of its constituents. In this study the antioxidant effect of fresh and <b>dried</b> <b>fruits</b> of L. scerara was evaluated by comparing the 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1, 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging and reducing capacity of ethyl acetate and n-butanol extracts of fresh and <b>dried</b> <b>fruits.</b> The comparison was further emphasized by high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) analysis of the extracts so as to relate activities with their chemical profiles. Results indicated that ethyl acetate (EA) extract of the fresh fruits exhibited higher DPPH radical scavenging activity than other samples. At 0. 01 mg/ml the order of activity was: EA <b>dried</b> <b>fruits</b> (50. 6 %) < Bt (n-butanol) fresh fruits (53. 3 %) < Bt (n-butanol) <b>dried</b> <b>fruits</b> (64. 8 %) < EA fresh fruits (68. 6 %) < Gallic acid (81. 8 %). A slight change of activity was observed at 0. 1 mg/ml, where the order was; EA <b>dried</b> <b>fruits</b> (70 %) < Bt <b>dried</b> <b>fruits</b> (71. 8 %) ≤ Bt fresh fruits (72 %) < EA fresh fruits (81. 6 %) < Gallic acid (88. 5 %). In the reducing capacity assay, Bt fresh fruits extract exhibited higher reducing power than all test samples. The HPTLC chemical profiles of both fresh and <b>dried</b> <b>fruit</b> extracts showed some slight differences. The slight differences in antioxidant activities were justified by the HPTLC chemical profiles of the fruits.
