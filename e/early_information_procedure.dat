Patients with an early response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy have chemo-sensitive tumors and a high probability for a pathological complete response at surgery. However, this <b>early</b> <b>information</b> has yet to be used in current clinical practice to tailor therapy. For example, when an insufficient response to combination therapy with anthracycline and taxane occurs, no alternative options are available to improve outcome; conversely, when a sufficient response occurs, no options are available to reduce or to intensify the extent of treatment.
