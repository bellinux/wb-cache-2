The FBI ended up treating Mihdhar as an intelligence case, which meant that the FBI's criminal investigators could not work on the case, due to the barrier separating intelligence and criminal case operations. [...] An agent in the New York office sent an e-mail to FBI headquarters saying, [...] "Whatever has happened to this, someday someone will die, and the public will not understand why we were not more effective and throwing every resource we had at certain 'problems.'"

Jacobs Company, whose chairman, Alexander Guterma, envisioned a media empire uniting Mutual with another recent purchase, the Hal Roach movie studio. After being questioned by federal investigators in February 1959 about financial improprieties, Guterma stepped down. Mutual, by this point, was floundering. For some years it had been run by owners who were either uninterested (General Tire, Armand Hammer) or now, as a growing amount of evidence would show, criminal. Mutual was also confronted with the situation the entire radio industry was facing: major advertisers were abandoning radio for television. Commercial rates had been cut. Limited sponsorship packages had been introduced, in which an advertiser could back a show for an abbreviated period rather than an entire season—but there was no reversing the trend. The networks were left with the bills for an increasing number of nonsponsored programs, known in the industry as [...] "sustaining" [...] shows. The loss of mainstay advertisers was accompanied by what historian Ronald Garay describes as the [...] "mass desertion of network radio talent, management and technicians for television.... <b>hese</b> people were taking with them the programming that had popularized the radio networks." ...|$|E

2500|$|To {{establish}} a community based instead on <b>ḥesed</b> (lovingkindness), the custom {{has long been}} for individuals to share or provide others with personal possessions as needed. The institution of the G'MaḤ provided a practical example for the sharing of books, tools, and services. The ideal of contributing to or forming one's own G'MaḤ was popularized by Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan (1838-1933), who addressed many halakhic questions about the practice and lauded the spiritual benefits of lending property in chapter 22 of his work, Ahavat <b>Ḥesed</b> (Loving Loving-kindness, 1888): [...] " [...] stems from compassion and constitutes a mitzvah, as ḤaZa"L have pointed out: [...] "tzedaka is performed with one’s money; <b>ḥesed</b> with one’s money and one’s self." [...] Rashi explains <b>ḥesed</b> here to mean the lending of money, chattel (personal property), livestock—all being included in the mitzvah." ...|$|R

2500|$|The Higgs {{mechanism}} {{is a process}} by which vector bosons can acquire rest mass without explicitly breaking gauge invariance, as a byproduct of spontaneous symmetry breaking. Initially, the mathematical theory behind spontaneous symmetry breaking was conceived and published within particle physics by Yoichiro Nambu in 1960, and the concept that such a mechanism could offer a possible solution for the [...] "mass problem" [...] was originally suggested in 1962 by Philip Anderson (who had previously written papers on broken symmetry and its outcomes in superconductivity, and concluded in his 1963 paper on the Yang-Mills theory, that [...] "considering the superconducting analog... <b>hese</b> two types of bosons seem capable of canceling each other out... leaving finite mass bosons"), and Abraham Klein and Benjamin Lee showed in March 1964, that Goldstone's theorem could be avoided this way {{in at least some}} non-relativistic cases, and speculated it might be possible in truly relativistic cases.|$|E
2500|$|Barrett {{was perhaps}} less {{successful}} in leading Florence Crittenton {{workers on the}} class divisions that crept into their work. While unwed mothers were hardly restricted {{at the time to}} the working class, middle-class and wealthy women had access to resources that could shield them from censure. As a result, Florence Crittenton work has been [...] characterized as mostly middle-class people “meddling” in working class lives [...] "in an effort to bring about a well-ordered society." [...] Katherine Aiken thinks this characterization is too sweeping and that it misses the genuine caring that Florence Crittenton workers brought to their work, identifying as women and mothers with their sister [...] "unfortunate girls". Aiken summarizes her conclusions by agreeing with critics that [...] "middle-class Crittenton workers sometimes forced their own values and life-style upon women of another class... <b>hese</b> actions sometimes resulted in negative effects on the women involved. Nevertheless, Crittenton homes served a purpose and filled a void that provided a real service to women enduring considerable personal turmoil." ...|$|E

60|$|Infinitely {{touching}} and sacred {{to us is}} the instinct of intense sympathy which drawst <b>hese</b> latter toward their great forerunner, exul immeritus like themselves.[78] But they have too often wrung a meaning from Dante which is injurious to the man and out of keeping {{with the ideas of}} his age. The aim in expounding a great poem should be, not to discover an endless variety of meanings often contradictory, but whatever it has of great and perennial significance; for such it must have, or it would long ago have ceased to be living and operative, would long ago have taken refuge in the Chartreuse of great libraries, dumb thenceforth to all mankind. We do not mean to say that this minute exegesis is useless or unpraiseworthy, but only that it should be subsidiary to the larger way. It serves to bring out more clearly what is very wonderful in Dante, namely, the omnipresence of his memory throughout the work, so that its intimate coherence does not exist in spite of the reconditeness and complexity of allusion, but is woven out of them. The poem has many senses, he tells us, and {{there can be no doubt}} of it; but it has also, and this alone will account for its fascination, a living soul behind them all and informing all, an intense singleness of purpose, a core of doctrine simple, human, and wholesome, though it be also, to use his own phrase, the bread of angels.|$|E
