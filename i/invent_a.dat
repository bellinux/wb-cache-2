5|$|In 1991, Richard Garfield {{approached}} Wizards of the Coast {{with the}} idea for a new board game called RoboRally, but was turned down because the game would have been too expensive for Wizards of the Coast to produce. Instead, Adkison asked Garfield if he could <b>invent</b> <b>a</b> game that was both portable and quick-playing, to which Garfield agreed.|$|E
5|$|In his {{cross-examination}} {{of the two}} doctors, Duchesne {{cited the}} psychological reports filed on Lamb at Penetanguishene in 1966, which had determined Lamb to have an IQ of 125, far above most of his 18-year-old peers. The prosecutor proposed {{that it was not}} beyond Lamb, with his psychopathic personality and high level of intelligence, to <b>invent</b> <b>a</b> story of amnesia and confusion to avoid responsibility for satisfying his dangerous impulses by consciously killing people. Both Yaworsky and Dolan said that although this was possible, they were each sticking to their original conclusions made in the days following the incident.|$|E
5|$|Because male-female {{relationships}} are inherently unequal in her society, Wollstonecraft endeavours {{to formulate a}} new kind of friendship in The Wrongs of Woman: motherhood and sisterhood. It is Maria's pathetic story regarding the kidnapping of her child that first interests Jemima in her plight. The novel fragments also suggest that the tale might not end with a marriage, but rather with the creation of {{a new kind of}} family, one constituted by two mothers for Maria's child. With Jemima's rescue of Maria, Wollstonecraft appears to reject the traditional romantic plot and <b>invent</b> <b>a</b> new one, necessitated by the failure of society to grant women their natural rights.|$|E
50|$|He {{teamed with}} Walrath in 1880 to form Lipe-Walrath Company and <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> broom-sewing machine and by 1885 <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> cigar-box making machine.|$|R
50|$|He did {{important}} {{work in the}} development of high-pressure cloud chambers for the study of neutrons produced by accelerators. He <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> neutron-counter-ratio technique for the determination of neutron emission thresholds. He also <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> sphere-moderated neutron spectrometer.|$|R
5000|$|Everett <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> {{system of}} {{shorthand}} which he published (1877 and 1883); and, <b>a</b> pioneer cyclist, <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> spring hub attachment for the spokes of bicycle wheels. He also introduced the so-called [...] "gridiron" [...] slide rule, in 1866.|$|R
5|$|Dawson relayed {{this story}} to Bulawayo, where Company {{authorities}} made enquiries. No {{man who had been}} attached to the column corroborated the account. The Company thought it unlikely that a Matabele inDuna would simply <b>invent</b> <b>a</b> story such as this, however, and angrily speculated that if it were true, then negotiations with Lobengula might have been opened and the war ended before Wilson crossed the river, and the entire episode of the Shangani Patrol avoided (though, as historian Robert Cary writes, this surmision ignores the fact that Forbes had been ordered to capture Lobengula, not end the war). Lawyers appointed by the Company launched a formal investigation early in 1894.|$|E
5|$|Later in {{the evening}} Jess becomes {{frustrated}} when he finds that May Belle has drawn in his notebook, but his strict yet caring father (Robert Patrick) sides with her. He later watches them gardening together, disappointed that his father does not spend time with him. Moreover, his mother cherishes her daughter more than him. The next day at school, Leslie compliments Jess' drawing ability, and they soon become friends. After school, they venture {{into the woods and}} swing across a creek on a rope. Jess and Leslie find an abandoned tree house on the other side, and <b>invent</b> <b>a</b> new world, which they call Terabithia. The fantasy world, which is a reflection on their lives, comes to life through their eyes as they explore the surroundings. For the next few days, Jess and Leslie spend their free time in the tree house getting to know each other.|$|E

50|$|In 1877 Francis Blake <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> carbon {{microphone}} {{for use in}} the telephone, shortly after Thomas Edison <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> microphone that also used carbon contacts. Blake used a carbon button design that initially would not stay in adjustment, but with later improvements proved to be workable. Alexander Graham Bell hired Blake and put him to work with Emile Berliner who also <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> {{carbon microphone}}. The improved Berliner-Blake microphone was standard with the Bell company for many years.|$|R

5000|$|He {{dabbled in}} {{applications}} of the new Morse Code, and <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> method of signaling long distances by [...] "light flashes." [...] He is credited with <b>inventing</b> <b>a</b> new method for the insertion of rifled steel cores into brass or iron cannon.|$|R

50|$|Chasey <b>invented,</b> <b>a</b> Stabilometer Computerized Analog Recording System (SCARS), {{through a}} grant from the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation in 1974. He <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> Serial Stacker for Measuring Gross Motor Learning by Young Retarded Children, through a Biomedical Research Grant, from the National Institutes of Health in 1973. Chasey, along with James Hogge, <b>invented,</b> <b>A</b> Curve Smoothing Program for Plotting a Predictive Value for a Polynomial Fitted for an IBM 1130 Computer, through {{a grant from}} the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation in 1974.|$|R
25|$|He tinkered {{further with}} motor engines when he {{acquired}} an army-type jeep {{and proceeded to}} <b>invent</b> <b>a</b> second steering-wheel mechanism, adjoined to the pre-existing engine at the rear end, so that the vehicle was able to move in both forward and backward directions with all four pre-existing gears.|$|E
25|$|There was {{an actual}} {{historical}} Kingdom of Gwynedd, {{an important part}} of Wales with a long history of its own. The fictional kingdom is in no way identical to it; still, it was clearly the writer's conscious decision to use the name of an actual kingdom, rather than <b>invent</b> <b>a</b> fictional name.|$|E
25|$|Although George Loddiges' {{arboretum}} {{was widely}} praised, his better known horticultural endeavour {{was to establish}} the world's largest hothouse in his Hackney Botanic Nursery, and <b>invent</b> <b>a</b> system of warm mist-like rain to maintain beautiful tropical palms, ephiphytic orchids, ferns and camellias in almost perfect environmental conditions akin to a 'tropical rainforest'.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of his {{involvement}} with the Board of Trustees of Georgia, Hales learnt of the problems resulting from overcrowding of ships and this spurred him to <b>invent</b> <b>a</b> ship ventilator and undertake experiments to distil fresh water from sea water and to use salt to preserve meat on board ship.|$|E
25|$|Earth-45 is {{visited in}} Grant Morrison's Action Comics run. On this world, Clark Kent {{is a genius}} who with Jimmy and Lois intends to <b>invent</b> <b>a</b> robot – Superman – to protect the world.

He went about to <b>invent</b> <b>a</b> way to support his trousers that wouldn't need braces as these interrupted his swing whilst playing golf and caused his shirt to become untucked.|$|E
25|$|Between 1815 and 1823 Rossini {{produced}} 20 operas. Of these, Otello {{formed the}} climax to his reform of serious opera (opera seria), {{and offers a}} suggestive contrast with {{the treatment of the}} same subject at a similar point of artistic development by the composer Giuseppe Verdi. In Rossini's time, the tragic ending was so distasteful to the public of Rome that it was necessary to <b>invent</b> <b>a</b> happy conclusion to Otello.|$|E
25|$|Rabinow was an {{investigator}} in the (Human) Practices Thrust of the Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center. http://synberc.org. With Gaymon Bennett, {{he had been}} part of a collaborative effort to re-think the relationship between ethics and science within this NSF funded Engineering Research Center. In SynBERC, the mandate from the NSF was to <b>invent</b> <b>a</b> collaborative mode of engagement such that the relationship between ethics and science might be reconceived and reworked.|$|E
