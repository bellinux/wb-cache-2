5|$|Ecological {{systems are}} studied at several {{different}} levels, from {{the scale of}} the <b>ecology</b> of individual organisms, to those of populations, to the ecosystems and finally the biosphere. The term population biology is often used interchangeably with population <b>ecology,</b> although population biology is more frequently used in the case of diseases, viruses, and microbes, while the term population <b>ecology</b> is more commonly applied to the study of plants and animals. <b>Ecology</b> draws on many subdisciplines.|$|E
5|$|The {{important}} {{relationship between}} <b>ecology</b> and genetic inheritance predates modern techniques for molecular analysis. Molecular ecological research became more feasible {{with the development}} of rapid and accessible genetic technologies, such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The rise of molecular technologies and influx of research questions into this new ecological field resulted in the publication Molecular <b>Ecology</b> in 1992. Molecular <b>ecology</b> uses various analytical techniques to study genes in an evolutionary and ecological context. In 1994, John Avise also played a leading role in this area of science with the publication of his book, Molecular Markers, Natural History and Evolution. Newer technologies opened a wave of genetic analysis into organisms once difficult to study from an ecological or evolutionary standpoint, such as bacteria, fungi, and nematodes. Molecular <b>ecology</b> engendered a new research paradigm for investigating ecological questions considered otherwise intractable. Molecular investigations revealed previously obscured details in the tiny intricacies of nature and improved resolution into probing questions about behavioural and biogeographical <b>ecology.</b> For example, molecular <b>ecology</b> revealed promiscuous sexual behaviour and multiple male partners in tree swallows previously thought to be socially monogamous. In a biogeographical context, the marriage between genetics, <b>ecology,</b> and evolution resulted in a new sub-discipline called phylogeography.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} some central {{theoretical and}} methodological constructs {{in the field}} of urban <b>ecologies,</b> identifies research gaps in the field, and uses the Victoria Laboratory of Urban <b>Ecologies</b> (VALUE) as a case study illustrating possible directions of future urban <b>ecologies</b> research. It begins by tracing the theoretical roots of urban <b>ecologies</b> before reviewing contemporary urban <b>ecologies</b> studies throughout the world. Two critical gaps in urban <b>ecologies</b> research are identified, suggesting opportunities for future studies. The paper then introduces the research teams and projects of VALUE – a research centre hosted by the School of Architecture and Building at Deakin University. The paper concludes that the research activities in VALUE are at the edge of urban <b>ecologies</b> research due to the interdisciplinary nature of collaboration in and between project teams, which have thus been able to address gaps in urban <b>ecologies</b> research and make important contributions to the field...|$|R

5|$|Birds {{are often}} {{important}} to island <b>ecology.</b> Birds have frequently reached islands that mammals have not; on those islands, birds may fulfil ecological roles typically played by larger animals. For example, in New Zealand the moas were important browsers, {{as are the}} kereru and kokako today. Today the plants of New Zealand retain the defensive adaptations evolved {{to protect them from}} the extinct moa. Nesting seabirds may also affect the <b>ecology</b> of islands and surrounding seas, principally through the concentration of large quantities of guano, which may enrich the local soil and the surrounding seas.|$|E
40|$|Places of {{residence}} have multiple, yet largely unintegrated, cultural characteristics. Here I {{make a distinction}} between human environments that offer demanding winters or summers together with collective poverty (threatening <b>ecologies),</b> undemanding temperate climates irrespective of income per head (comforting <b>ecologies),</b> and demanding winters or summers together with collective wealth (challenging <b>ecologies).</b> After reviewing prior research into cultural characteristics under these environmental conditions, I am reporting a climato-economic study of we/they discrimination across 95 nations. Together, these investigations show that threatening <b>ecologies</b> are prone to mental ill-being, bureaucratic organizing, press repression, autocratic politics, survival goals, societal collectivism and relatively strong we/they discrimination. By contrast, challenging <b>ecologies</b> are prone to mental well-being, organic organizing, press freedom, democratic politics, self-expression goals, societal individualism and relatively weak we/they discrimination. In between these extremes, comforting <b>ecologies</b> are prone to intermediate cultural realities...|$|R

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{there were}} so many {{uncritical}} and unproven speculations about floral mechanisms that floral <b>ecology</b> became discredited. In the 1920s, it was revived with further developments in detailed analyses of insects' senses, led by researchers Frederic Clements, Karl von Frisch and others. Their experiments resulted in new information, including the discovery that some insects have ultraviolet vision, and findings involving bee learning and communication. Modern floral <b>ecology</b> has been reinvigorated by its relevance for evolutionary studies.|$|E
5|$|Community <b>ecology</b> is {{the study}} of the {{interactions}} among a collections of species that inhabit the same geographic area.

It might also include the analysis of predator-prey dynamics, competition among similar plant species, or mutualistic interactions between crabs and corals.|$|E

40|$|This paper reports upon {{collaborative}} NWO-AHRC {{research conducted}} by UK and Dutch cultural geographers and artists into tidal <b>ecologies</b> {{of place in the}} UK and Holland and beyond. Tidal zones are extraordinarily dynamic spaces which generate complex <b>ecologies</b> which interconnect land and sea, air and water as elements, salt water and fresh water as variations of the latter, and a range of eco-social assemblages. All these interconnecting processes are set in series of rhythms driven by tidal cycles. Tides literally mix space, time and materiality. Tidal processes in different locations vary markedly in term of range, the habitats and <b>ecologies</b> generated, and in the way local culture and economy engage with them (<b>ecologies</b> of place). For a range of reasons which include possible climate change induced sea level rise, and various forms of development and exploitation, tidal areas around the world, and the important interconnected natural and culture they support, are under a great deal of pressure. Accounts of tidal <b>ecologies</b> of place, particularly as generated by artists, in the Severn Estuary UK and the Wadden Sea Netherlands will be discussed...|$|R

5|$|<b>Ecology</b> and {{evolutionary}} biology are considered sister disciplines {{of the life}} sciences. Natural selection, life history, development, adaptation, populations, and inheritance are examples of concepts that thread equally into ecological {{and evolutionary}} theory. Morphological, behavioural, and genetic traits, for example, can be mapped onto evolutionary trees to study {{the historical development of}} a species in relation to their functions and roles in different ecological circumstances. In this framework, the analytical tools of ecologists and evolutionists overlap as they organize, classify, and investigate life through common systematic principals, such as phylogenetics or the Linnaean system of taxonomy. The two disciplines often appear together, such as in the title of the journal Trends in <b>Ecology</b> and Evolution. There is no sharp boundary separating <b>ecology</b> from evolution, and they differ more in their areas of applied focus. Both disciplines discover and explain emergent and unique properties and processes operating across different spatial or temporal scales of organization. While the boundary between <b>ecology</b> and evolution is not always clear, ecologists study the abiotic and biotic factors that influence evolutionary processes, and evolution can be rapid, occurring on ecological timescales as short as one generation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ecology</b> surged {{in popular}} and {{scientific}} interest during the 1960–1970s environmental movement. There are strong historical and scientific ties between <b>ecology,</b> environmental management, and protection. The historical emphasis and poetic naturalistic writings advocating {{the protection of}} wild places by notable ecologists {{in the history of}} conservation biology, such as Aldo Leopold and Arthur Tansley, have been seen as far removed from urban centres where, it is claimed, the concentration of pollution and environmental degradation is located. Palamar (2008) notes an overshadowing by mainstream environmentalism of pioneering women in the early 1900s who fought for urban health <b>ecology</b> (then called euthenics) and brought about changes in environmental legislation. Women such as Ellen Swallow Richards and Julia Lathrop, among others, were precursors to the more popularized environmental movements after the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|In <b>ecology,</b> {{sustainability}} (from sustain and ability) is {{the property}} of biological systems to remain diverse and productive indefinitely. Long-lived and healthy wetlands and forests are examples of sustainable biological systems. In more general terms, sustainability is the endurance of systems and processes. The organizing principle for sustainability is sustainable development, which includes the four interconnected domains: <b>ecology,</b> economics, politics and culture. Sustainability science {{is the study of}} sustainable development and environmental science.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, as {{evolutionary}} theorists {{explored the}} possibility of multiple units of selection, ecologists turned to evolutionary approaches.

The evolution of ecosystems, however, became a lasting research focus. <b>Ecology</b> expanded rapidly {{with the rise of}} the environmental movement; the International Biological Program attempted to apply the methods of big science (which had been so successful in the physical sciences) to ecosystem <b>ecology</b> and pressing environmental issues, while smaller-scale independent efforts such as island biogeography and the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest helped redefine the scope of an increasingly diverse discipline.|$|E
