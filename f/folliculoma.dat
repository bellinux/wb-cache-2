50|$|Granulosa cell tumours (or granulosa-theca cell tumours or <b>folliculoma)</b> are tumours {{that arise}} from granulosa cells. These tumours {{are part of the}} sex cord-gonadal stromal tumour or non-epithelial group of tumours. Although granulosa cells {{normally}} occur only in the ovary, granulosa cell tumours occur in both ovaries and testicles (see Ovarian cancer and Testicular cancer). These tumours should be considered malignant and treated {{in the same way as}} other malignant tumours of ovary. The ovarian disease has two forms, juvenile and adult, both characterized by indolent growth, and therefore has high recovery rates. The staging system for these tumours is the same as for epithelial tumours and most present as stage I. The peak age at which they occur is 50-55 years, but they may occur at any age.|$|E
40|$|Abstract A 12 -year-old girl {{presented}} {{to us with}} a swelling over the lateral surface of the right pinna of 4 years duration. Examination revealed an irregular mass arising from lateral surface of the pinna obscuring the external auditory canal. The lesion was not ulcerated. Wide excision of mass done and sent for Histopathological examination which revealed Tricho <b>folliculoma.</b> This case is being reported {{as it is a}} rare skin adnexal tumor arising from an unusual site...|$|E
40|$|The authors presentthe {{course of}} puberty in three girls after surgery because of {{hormonal}} active ovarian tumours diagnosed and operated {{at the age}} of 3, 6 and 9 years respectively. In the youngest patient with <b>folliculoma</b> ovari also chemotherapy was performed and the girl No. 3 with the luteinic capsule was for one year treated with Decapeptile because diagnosed was idiopathic precocious puberty. At present all the three girls are in a good physical condition with any age adequate development and puberty...|$|E
40|$|Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) {{in women}} is {{secreted}} by granulosa cells in late preantral and small antral follicles. AMH {{seems to be}} a very stable marker having some advantages over other biochemical and biophysical markers and is very useful in the assessment of ovarian reserve. AMH measurement may be used in cases of premature ovarian failure, including iatrogenic, due to treatment for cancer, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and lastly, in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is also a very specific marker of ovarian tumors – <b>folliculomas.</b> According to outcomes of some studies, AMH seems to be highly predictive for the timing of menopause. There are mathematical models in which a single AMH measurement is used to predict the time of menopause even in very young women, many years before the last period...|$|R
40|$|Spontaneous folliculosis of Macacus rhesus monkeys—a type of {{follicular}} conjunctivitis {{associated with}} marked, local, inflammatory reactions—is apparently a disease sui generis, {{due to a}} specific infectious agent. It can be transmitted from monkey to monkey by means of subconjunctival injection of suspensions, and by conjunctival swabbing of the secretions, of affected tissues, or by contact of normal animals with folliculosis monkeys. The agent causing folliculosis has failed in our hands to pass through Berkefeld and Seitz filters, even those of an unusual degree of permeability; and the lesions that it causes show no cellular inclusions suggestive of the action of a virus. The condition is due apparently to an organism of low grade pathogenicity. The essential histopathological structure corresponds {{to that of a}} <b>folliculoma</b> (16) which, while not identical with a granuloma, bears certain resemblances to the latter. The studies here reported concern only one species of monkey, Macacus rhesus. Further investigations will be carried out on different species of Anthropoidea and other animals...|$|E
