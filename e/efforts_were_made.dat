5|$|Convoys from Britain {{lacked the}} surface vessel escort after 13°W. Hudsons could only make sweeps up to 17°W but lacked {{endurance}} to stay there. From Gibraltar, {{the lack of}} flying boats meant a lack of air cover after 100 miles. Nevertheless, great <b>efforts</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> with limited resources to provide cover from first to last light, the time when U-boats could use the rising and setting sun to see the silhouettes on the horizon.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Britain, concerted <b>efforts</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> by the Luftwaffe {{to destroy}} the main {{manufacturing}} plants at Woolston and Itchen, near Southampton. The first bombing raid, which missed the factories, came on 23 August 1940. Over the next month, other raids were mounted until, on 26 September 1940, both factories were destroyed, with 92 people killed {{and a large number}} injured. Most of the casualties were experienced aircraft production workers.|$|E

5|$|Serving {{during the}} {{disorders}} of Stephen's reign, Theobald succeeded in forcing peace on the king {{by refusing to}} consecrate Stephen's son and heir, Eustace. After Eustace's death in 1153, Stephen recognised his rival Henry of Anjou as his heir, and later Theobald was named regent of the kingdom after Stephen's death. After a long illness, Theobald died in 1161, following which unsuccessful <b>efforts</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> to have him canonised as a saint.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, concerns grew in the British government about the threat of German invasion along the east coast of England. The bays just to the north of Dunstanburgh Castle were vulnerable targets for an enemy amphibious landing, and <b>efforts</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> to fortify the castle and the surrounding area in 1940, as part of a wider line of defences erected by Sir Edmund Ironside.|$|E

5|$|This {{series of}} events was {{consequential}} to the Indian independence movement. Though largely subdued {{by the end of}} World War I, it came to be a major factor in reforming the Raj's Indian policy. Similar <b>efforts</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> during World War II in Germany and in Japanese-controlled Southeast Asia, where Subhas Chandra Bose formed the Indische Legion and the Indian National Army respectively, and in Italy where Mohammad Iqbal Shedai formed the Battaglione Azad Hindoustan.|$|E
5|$|Until 1864, {{communications}} between Fort Greble {{and its neighbors}} had to be routed through departmental headquarters in Washington. After {{a test of the}} system completely failed, <b>efforts</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> to establish signaling points between the forts, and the forts themselves were connected to Washington via telegraph wire. Signal detachments were present at Fort Stanton, near Uniontown, and sometimes visited Fort Greble as part of training efforts.|$|E

Owing to Mahesh's popularity there, the makers offered to screen Aagadu in every university there and in other countries, if {{there are more than}} 100 students willing to watch the film. <b>Efforts</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> to release the film across the United States with subtitles.|$|E

5|$|After September 1939, desperate <b>efforts</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> {{to improve}} the situation, but with very little result. Germany, for obvious reasons, delayed its deliveries; France was {{hesitant}} to equip an army that would not unequivocally take its side. The one abundant source of readily available weaponry, the Soviet Union, was inaccessible because the Dutch, contrary to most other nations, did not recognise the communist regime. An attempt in 1940 to procure Soviet armour captured by Finland failed.|$|E
5|$|Buddhist {{scholars}} living {{during the}} time of the Liao dynasty predicted that the mofa (末法), an age in which the three treasures of Buddhism would be destroyed, was to begin in the year 1052. Previous dynasties, including the Sui and Tang, were also concerned with the mofa, although their predictions for when the mofa would start were different from the one selected by the Liao. As early as the Sui dynasty, <b>efforts</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> to preserve Buddhist teachings by carving them into stone or burying them. These efforts continued into the Liao dynasty, with Emperor Xingzong funding several projects in the years immediately preceding 1052.|$|E
5|$|By {{the first}} decade of the 20th century, a number of {{business}} entities had formed themselves into trusts, which dominated their industries. Trusts often sought to purchase or otherwise neutralize their competitors, allowing the conglomerates to raise prices to high levels. In 1890, Congress had passed the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, but it was not until the Theodore Roosevelt administration (1901–09) that serious <b>efforts</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> to break up or control the trusts. The dominant force in the oil industry was Standard Oil, controlled by John D. Rockefeller. Modern-day Exxon, Mobil, Atlantic Richfield, Chevron, Sohio, Amoco and Continental Oil all trace their ancestry to various parts of Standard Oil.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{began on}} the part of SR905 between Britannia Boulevard and Siempre Viva Road in April 2008, and from Brittania Boulevard to I-805 in July 2009. <b>Efforts</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> to keep {{construction}} going despite a shortfall in funding from state bonds in 2009. The part between Britannia Boulevard and Siempre Viva Road opened in December 2010. The interchange with I-805 began to be upgraded in April 2011, and the construction, which used $20million in federal funding, finished in February 2012. The final freeway segment of SR905 between I-805 and Britannia Boulevard opened on July 30, 2012. The entire cost of the project connecting I-805 to the border crossing was $441million.|$|E
5|$|During Sa'ad Zaghloul's term as {{minister}} of education, {{before he went}} on to lead the Egyptian Revolution of 1919, further <b>efforts</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> to modify the educational policy of al-Azhar. While a bastion of conservatism in many regards, the mosque was opposed to Islamic fundamentalism, especially as espoused by the Muslim Brotherhood, founded in 1928. The school attracted students from throughout the world, including students from Southeast Asia and particularly Indonesia, providing a counterbalance to the influence of the Wahhabis in Saudi Arabia.|$|E
5|$|Enomoto's fleet joined Sendai harbour on August 26. Although the Northern Coalition was numerous, it was poorly equipped, and {{relied on}} {{traditional}} fighting methods. Modern armament was scarce, and last-minute <b>efforts</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> to build cannons {{made of wood}} and reinforced with roping, firing stone projectiles. Such cannons, installed on defensive structures, could only fire four or five projectiles before bursting. On the other hand, the daimyō of Nagaoka managed to procure {{two of the three}} Gatling guns in Japan and 2,000 modern French rifles from the German weapons dealer Henry Schnell.|$|E

5|$|Faced {{with the}} clear hostility of the Russian Emperor Nicholas I, Wallachian revolutionaries sought instead a {{rapprochement}} with the Ottoman leadership. <b>Efforts</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> {{to clarify that}} the movement did not seek to reject Ottoman suzerainty: for this purpose, Ion Ghica was sent to Istanbul as early as May 29, 1848; his mission was initially successful, but later events led Sultan Abdülmecid I to reconsider his position, especially after being faced with Russian protests. Süleyman Pașa, Abdülmecid's brother-in-law, was dispatched to Bucharest with orders {{to report on the}} situation and take appropriate measures.|$|E

5|$|On 15 February 2010, {{services}} between Brussels and London {{were interrupted}} following the Halle train collision, this {{time after the}} dedicated HSL 1 lines {{in the suburbs of}} the Belgian capital were blocked by debris from a serious train crash on the suburban commuter lines alongside. No <b>efforts</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> to reroute trains around the blockage; Eurostar instead terminated services to Brussels at Lille, directing passengers to continue their journey on local trains.
