30|$|In summary, we {{presented}} an EA polarization-insensitive plasmonic waveguide modulator. The waveguide structure consists of hybrid waveguides in both x and y directions, where dual polarization modes are existing. The hybrid plasmonic waveguide forms a MOS capacitor where the carrier accumulations occur at dielectric-ITO interfaces when the doped-Si electrode is biased {{at a lower}} voltage than metal electrode. The light modulation is investigated by tuning the carrier density. A minimum ΔER of 0.009  dB/μm at the wavelength of 1.55  μm is demonstrated by simulation.

Survivin is highly expressed in most cancer types and contributes to multiple facets of carcinogenesis.

In this study, we have generated an alpaca survivin nanobody (SVVNb 8) that binds with low nanomolar affinity to its target.

40|$|A {{number of}} studies have been {{conducted}} to improve chromophore maturation, folding kinetics, thermostability, and other traits of green fluorescent protein (GFP). However, no specific work aimed at improving the thermostability of the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and of the pH-sensitive, yet thermostable color variants of GFP has so far been done. The protein variants reported in this study were improved through rational multiple site-directed mutagenesis of GFP (ASV) by introducing up to ten point mutations including the mutations near and at the chromophore region. Therefore, we report the development and characterization of fast folder and thermo-tolerant green variant (FF-GFP), and a fast folder thermostable yellow fluorescent protein (FFTS-YFP) endowed with remarkably improved thermostability and folding kinetics. We demonstrate that the fluorescence intensity of this yellow variant is not affected by heating at 75  °C. Moreover, we have developed a pH-unresponsive cyan variant AcS-CFP, which has potential use as part of in vivo imaging irrespective of intracellular pH. The combined improved properties make these fluorescent variants ideal tools to study protein expression and function under different pH environments, in mesophiles and thermophiles. <b>Furthermore,</b> <b>coupling</b> of the FFTS-YFP and AcS-CFP could potentially serve as an ideal tool to perform functional analysis of live cells by multicolor labeling...|$|E

Currently, solid-state qubits, and in particular the superconducting ones, seem to satisfy the requirements for being the building blocks of viable quantum computers, since they exhibit relatively long coherence times, extremely low dissipation, and scalability. The possibility of achieving quantum coherence in macroscopic circuits comprising Josephson junctions, envisioned by Legett in the 1980 's, was demonstrated for the first time in a charge qubit; since then, the exploitation of macroscopic quantum effects in low-capacitance Josephson junction circuits allowed for the realization of several kinds of superconducting qubits. <b>Furthermore,</b> <b>coupling</b> between qubits has been successfully achieved that was followed by the construction of multiple-qubit logic gates and the implementation of several algorithms.

40|$|The receptors for interleukin- 3 (IL- 3) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) share {{a common}} β subunit, the distal cytoplasmic domain of which is {{essential}} for the promotion of cell survival by these two cytokines. Genes whose expression is specifically induced by signaling through the distal cytoplasmic domain of this receptor β subunit were screened by a subtraction cloning approach in derivatives of a mouse pro-B-cell line. One gene thus identified was shown to encode a protein highly homologous (with only 7 amino acid substitutions) to murine osteopontin (OPN), a secreted adhesion protein. Conditioned medium from cells expressing wild-type OPN, but not that from cells expressing a deletion mutant lacking residues 79 to 140, increased the viability of a non-OPN-producing cell line in the presence of human GM-CSF.

For the solution of these systems usually Newton-like methods are used.

40|$|The in situ {{response}} of photophosphorylation and coupling factor activity to low leaf water potential (ψL) was investigated using kinetic spectroscopy {{to measure the}} flash-induced electrochromic absorption change in attached sunflower (Helianthus annuus L. cv IS 894) leaves. The electrochromic change {{is caused by the}} formation of an electric potential across the thylakoid membrane associated with proton uptake. Since depolarization of the thylakoid membrane following flash excitation is normally dominated by proton efflux through the coupling factor during ATP formation, this measurement can provide direct information about the catalytic activity of the coupling factor. Under low ψL conditions in which a clear nonstomatal limitation of net photosynthesis could be demonstrated, we found a strong inhibition of coupling factor activity in dark-adapted leaves which was probably caused by an increase in the energetic threshold for the activation of the enzyme at low ψL. While this result supported earlier in vitro findings, we further discovered that the light-dependent reduction of coupling factor reversed any observable effect of low ψL on the energetics of activation or on photophosphorylation competence. <b>Furthermore,</b> <b>coupling</b> factor was reduced, even in severely droughted sunflower, almost immediately upon illumination.

30|$|Recently, {{significant}} {{efforts have}} been made to explore transition metal-based electrocatalysts for the OER because of their low cost, abundant reserves, environmental benignity, and resistance to corrosion in alkaline solutions [9, 10, 11, 12]. Among them, Co-based catalysts have emerged as promising alternatives for precious metal-based catalysts [13, 14, 15, 16]. The electrocatalytic activity for OER is closely related to the active sites and electronic conductivity of the catalysts. Previous research has demonstrated that active sites can be engineered by modulating the particle size, pore structure [17, 18], and the crystallinity [19, 20] of Co 3 O 4. <b>Furthermore,</b> <b>coupling</b> with carbon effectively improves the electronic conductivity of the catalysts [21, 22, 23]. Nevertheless, carbon itself as a catalyst displays relatively low catalytic OER activity. Recent studies have shown that doping with either nitrogen or transition metals into carbon nanostructure can efficiently promote its catalytic performance [23, 24, 25, 26]. The template method has proven to be an effective protocol for obtaining nitrogen-doped Co 3 O 4 /C composites. In this method, various organic hybrids, which contain both the transition metal and nitrogen, are used as precursors such as melamine [27], porphyrin [28], polyaniline [29, 30], and salen [31]. However, it is hard to control the size, structure, and morphology of these organic hybrids in an exact manner; therefore, deficiencies and non-uniform distributions of active sites are prevalent, which are also crucial for electrocatalytic activity.|$|E

A circular cell approximation of the vortex lattice within the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity is applied to a recently developed model appropriate for such a two-band system [Tanaka et al 2006 Phys. Rev. B 73, 220501 (R); Tanaka et al 2007 Phys. Rev. B 75, 214512]. We assume that superconductivity in the 3 D diffusive band is "weak", i. e., mostly induced, {{as is the case in}} MgB$_ 2 $. Hybridization with the "weak" 3 D diffusive band has significant and intriguing influence on the electronic structure of the "strong" 2 D ballistic band. In particular, the Coulomb repulsion and the diffusivity in the "weak" band enhance suppression of the order parameter and enlargement of the vortex core by magnetic field in the "strong" band, resulting in reduced critical temperature and field. Moreover, increased diffusivity in the "weak" band can result in an upward curvature of the upper critical field near the transition temperature. A particularly interesting feature found in our model is the appearance of additional bound states at the gap edge in the "strong" ballistic band, which are absent in the single-band case. <b>Furthermore,</b> <b>coupling</b> with the "weak" diffusive band leads to reduced band gaps and van Hove singularities of energy bands of the vortex lattice in the "strong" ballistic band.
