40|$|Andrew Jackson is roasted {{over the}} fires of "Public Opinion" by the figure of Justice in a cartoon {{relating}} to the controversy surrounding Jackson's removal of federal deposits from the Bank of the United States. Jackson, with {{the body of a}} pig, is prone on a gridiron over a stone barbecue oven. The fire is stoked by former Secretary of the Treasury William Duane, at lower right, while Jack Downing, lower left, splits kindling. Jack Downing: "I jest split a little kindleying wood, so Amos can jest make Broth for all hands &c. " Duane: "I am opposed to Removing the Deposits, as I was when I was Secretary, but prefer gently Stirring them up. " Five men, opponents of Jackson's bank program, stand behind the barbecue. They are (from left to right) Senators Henry Clay, Daniel Webster (holding a knife), William B. Preston, Bank president Nicholas Biddle, and an unidentified fifth man. Vice-President Martin Van Buren, as an imp, flies off to the right with a sack of Treasury Notes over his shoulder. Clay: "Dan this is what they call in Kentuc our High Game to their Low Jack. " Webster: "In Massachusetts they call it Roasting. " Preston: "In South Carolina t'is called Barbecue only he wants a little more Basteing. " Biddle: "In Pennsylvania we find it difficult to find a home for the animal but have concluded to call him Nondescript pertaking of the General, <b>Hog,</b> <b>Man</b> and Devil. " Fifth man: "We think he pertakes strongly of the Rooter, for he has rooted our treasures {{all over the country and}} was squeeling for the Pension-fund when Clay caught him and put a ring in his nose, and we've all given it a twist. " Van Buren: "T'is my business to get folks in trouble and their business to get themselves out.

2500|$|This is {{an outdoor}} exhibit {{designed}} {{to mimic the}} African savanna and educate visitors about cheetahs and {{what is being done}} to preserve them in the wild. The main part of the Cheetah Conservation Station consists of two enclosures separated by a fence. One enclosures houses two South African cheetahs (both males; Gat [...] and Bakari), while the other houses two male Grevy's zebras. Other animals on display in the area include scimitar-horned oryxs, dama gazelles, Rüppell's vultures, sitatungas, red river <b>hogs,</b> <b>maned</b> wolves (a species native to South America), an Abyssinian ground hornbill and three lesser kudu. A female tammar wallaby named Maji had been on display until December 2013, when she was euthanized at the very old age of 18 (most do not live beyond 10).|$|R

60|$|So Circe {{waved her}} wand again, and {{repeated}} a few magic words, {{at the sound}} of which the two and twenty hogs pricked up their pendulous ears. It was a wonder to behold how their snouts grew shorter and shorter, and their mouths (which they seemed to be sorry for, because they could not gobble so expeditiously) smaller and smaller, and how one and another began to stand upon his hind legs, and scratch his nose with his fore trotters. At first the spectators hardly knew whether to call them <b>hogs</b> or <b>men,</b> but by and by {{came to the conclusion that}} they rather resembled the latter. Finally, there stood the twenty-two comrades of Ulysses, looking pretty much the same as when they left the vessel.|$|R
50|$|The Chaco has an {{abundance}} of wildlife. Larger animals present in the region include jaguar, ocelot, puma, tapir, giant armadillo, spiny anteater, many species of foxes, numerous small wildcats, the agouti (a large rodent), the capybara (water <b>hog),</b> the <b>maned</b> wolf, the palustrian deer, the peccary and the guanaco (a camelid related to the llama). The Chaco {{is one of the}} last major refuges of the rhea (or nandu), a large flightless South American bird. The region has an abundant and varied bird population. The streams host more than 400 fish species, among which are the salmon-like dorado and the flesh-eating piranha. The region is home to many species of insects, some of which cause discomfort for travellers. Reptiles also are abundant, with numerous lizards and at least 60 known species of snakes, including many pit vipers and constrictors. At least six species of poisonous tree toads have been identified.|$|R
25|$|Arkansas ran for 257 yards, and Ole Miss QB Eli Manning {{threw for}} 414 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions. The first {{points of the}} game came for the Rebels when Matt Jones was called for {{intentionally}} grounding in the end zone, which by rule is scored a safety. Ole Miss gained a 2–0 lead, but fumbled near {{the close of the}} first quarter, resulting in a Razorback field goal. Lerinezo Robinson for the Hogs then returned a fumbled kickoff eight yards for a touchdown, giving Arkansas a 10–2 lead. Jonathan Nichols of Ole Miss then hit a 48-yard field, but a Jimmy Beasley interception of Eli Manning set up Arkansas for a 34-yard option keep touchdown by Matt Jones, giving an edge to the <b>Hogs,</b> 17–5. <b>Manning</b> then connected with Justin Sawyer, but the two point play was no good. First a field goal, then a touchdown closed out the first half for the Razorbacks, the TD set up by a 55-yard punt return by Decori Birmingham, to the Ole Miss 20.|$|R
40|$|Syftet var att beskriva arbetstillfredsställelsen hos intensivvårdssjuksköterskor samt undersöka om arbetssituationen förändrats senaste året. Syftet var vidare att se om skillnader förelåg i arbetstillfredsställelsen mellan intensivvårdssjuksköterskor som arbetade treskift och som inte arbetade treskift. Studien var deskriptiv med kvantitativ ansats. Sextiofyra sjuksköterskor deltog och bortfallet var 29 %. Enkäter testade gällande validitet och reliabilitet för arbetstillfredsställelse användes i studien. Arbetstillfredsställelsen var genomgående hög, intensivvårdssjuksköterskorna upplevde sig mötas med respekt av överordnade och samarbetsklimatet var bra. De var en del av ett team, arbetet var intressant och autonomin var hög. Majoriteten upplevde att personaltätheten var otillräcklig för arbetsbelastningen, beslut från överordnade gick inte att påverka och nästan en tredjedel upplevde sig inte få beröm vid bra utfört arbete. Trots genomgående hög arbetstillfredsställelse funderade nästan tjugo procent på att byta jobb. Senaste året hade arbetsbördan ökat med mer administrativt arbete och mindre tid för patientvård. Förtroendet för den offentliga sjukvården hade minskat. Inga signifikanta skillnader fanns gällande arbetstillfredsställelsen mellan intensivvårdssjuksköterskor som arbetade treskift och som inte arbetade treskift. Nattarbetet ansågs behöva värderas högre med mer tid för återhämtning. Konklusion: Arbetstillfredsställelsen var genomgående <b>hög</b> <b>men</b> arbetsbördan hade ökat senaste året, utbrett missnöje förekom gällande återhämtningstiden vid nattarbete. The {{objectives}} were {{to describe the}} work satisfaction amongst intensive care nurses, and to investigate if the work situation {{has changed over the}} last year. A further purpose was to see if there were any differences in the work satisfaction between intensive care nurses who worked three-shift {{and those who did not}}. The study was descriptive with a quantitative approach. Sixty-four nurses participated and the 29  percent decided not to participate. Questionnaires tested regarding validity and reliability for work satisfaction were used in the study. Work satisfaction was overall high; the intensive care nurses perceived themselves as being respected by superiors, and the work situation as good. They felt part of a team; the work was interesting and the levels of autonomy high. The majority perceived that the staffing levels were insufficient for the workload, they could not affect the decisions made by their superiors, and almost a third experienced that they do not get praise for work well done. Despite the overall high work satisfaction almost twenty percent were thinking of changing jobs. During the last year, the workload had increased with more administrative work leaving less time for patient care. The trust in public healthcare had decreased. No significant differences were found regarding the work satisfaction between intensive care nurses working three-shift and those who did not work three-shift. The general opinion was that night work needed to be valued higher, and that more time was needed for recovery. Conclusion: The work satisfaction was overall high, but the workload had increased over the last year, and there was a widespread dissatisfaction regarding recovery time after night work. ...|$|R

5000|$|The office {{originated}} in Saxon England, when hogreeves would be {{stationed at the}} doors of cathedrals during services to prevent swine from entering the church. [...] The office of hogreeve was among the earliest elected offices to exist in colonial North America; the earliest rights specifically granted to towns in New England concerned the herding of swine, cattle, and the regulation of fences and common fields. The field driver held similar duties but was not restricted to swine. The hogreeve was a historical municipal official in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island in Canada; it was also listed as an elected office in early New Hampshire township records. [...] In Massachusetts, towns could vote to stop enforcement of the state law against letting swine run loose; many towns did so, leaving their hog reeves with nothing to do. As a result, it became a joke to elect a <b>man</b> <b>hog</b> reeve {{during the first year}} of marriage.|$|R
25|$|Washington {{sent out}} Captain <b>Hog</b> with 75 <b>men</b> to pursue French troops who had {{threatened}} to destroy his house and property. However, shortly after Hog left, Washington called together some young Indians {{and told them that}} the French had come to kill Tanacharison, and the Indians also left to pursue the French. That evening, Washington received a message from Tanacharison, who said he had found the French encampment. Washington decided to attack himself and brought 40 soldiers with him towards Tanacharison's camp. That morning, they met with Tanacharison's 12 Indian warriors, and Washington and Tanacharison agreed to attack the encampment. Washington ambushed the French, killing 10 to 12, wounding 2 and capturing 21. Among the dead was Jumonville; the exact manner of his death is uncertain, but by several accounts Tanacharison executed Jumonville in cold blood, crushing his head with a tomahawk and washing his hands in Jumonville's brains. One account, reported by an Indian to Contrecœur, claimed that Jumonville was killed by Half King while the summons was being read.|$|R
60|$|This {{also shows}} wherein the {{identity}} of the same MAN consists; viz. in nothing but a participation of the same continued life, by constantly fleeting particles of matter, in succession vitally united to the same organized body. He that shall place {{the identity of}} man in anything else, but, like that of other animals, in one fitly organized body, taken in any one instant, and from thence continued, under one organization of life, in several successively fleeting particles of matter united to it, will find it hard to make an embryo, one of years, mad and sober, the SAME man, by any supposition, that will not make it possible for Seth, Ismael, Socrates, Pilate, St. Austin, and Caesar Borgia, to be the same man. For if the identity of SOUL ALONE makes the same MAN; and there be nothing in the nature of matter why the same individual spirit may not be united to different bodies, it will be possible that those men, living in distant ages, and of different tempers, may have been the same man: which way of speaking must be from a very strange use of the word man, applied to an idea out of which body and shape are excluded. And that way of speaking would agree yet worse with the notions of those philosophers who allow of transmigration, and are of opinion that the souls of men may, for their miscarriages, be detruded into the bodies of beasts, as fit habitations, with organs suited to the satisfaction of their brutal inclinations. But yet I think nobody, could he be sure that the SOUL of Heliogabalus were in one of his hogs, would yet say that <b>hog</b> were a <b>MAN</b> or Heliogabalus.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to study the addition of fluorescent whitening agents (FWAs) for efficient use on pigment coating of paper substrates with low grammage and {{the goal was to}} achieve high optical response by using low amount of FWAs. A commercial light-weight coated (LWC) paper grade was provided by Stora Enso Corbehem Mill and isotropic laboratory sheets were produced at Stora Enso Research Centre using PFI sheet former. Optical properties such as brightness, whiteness and L, a* and b* colour space values were evaluated using Minolta spectrophotometer with D 65 illuminant for both types of substrate using different types and amounts of FWA while the effect of the addition of dye was evaluated in both isotropic sheets and {{as well as in the}} coating. The results showed that brightness and whiteness of double-coated paper increased by increasing the amount of fluorescent whitening agent in the coating layer. Also, higher brightness and whiteness was achieved by introducing a higher amount of fluorescent whitening agent in the top coating rather than in a pre-coating. The addition of a shading colorant in the paper substrate had a positive influence not only on the brightness but also on the whiteness of coated paper. Syftet med denna studie var att studera tillsatsen av fluorescerande vitmedel (FWA) för att effektivisera användningen i pigmentbestrykning av papper med låg ytvikt. Målet var att nå en <b>hög</b> optisk respons <b>men</b> ändå använda en låg mängd FWA. Ett kommersiellt LWC-papper erhölls från Stora Enso, Corbehems pappersbruk, och isotropa laboratorieark tillverkades med PFI-arkformerare på Stora Enso Research Centre. Optiska egenskaper, såsom ljushet, vithet och färgrymd (L, a* och b* värden), hos samtliga prover med varierande mängd och typ av FWA uppmättes med hjälp av en Minolta spektrofotometer med D 65 ljuskälla. Effekten av färgnyanstillsats utvärderades både hos handgjorda ark och hos bestrykningslager. Resultaten visade att både ljushet och vithet hos dubbelbestrukna ark ökade med ökad mängd FWA i bestrykningslagren. Högre ljushet och vithet nåddes också när FWA placerades i toppbestrykningen. Tillsats av nyanseringsfärg i papperssubstratet ökade både ljushet och vithet hos de bestrukna arken...|$|R
