500|$|The opening {{sequence}} of the episode was meant to replicate the same idea of season 2's premiere [...] "Man of Science, Man of Faith", where {{what seems to be}} a flashback is instead set on a new part of the island. Director Jack Bender questioned what Jack's goal was when <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> the chain, but Lindelof told him not to worry, because [...] "Fox will sell it, and he did". Lindelof described when Jack attacks his father at the AA meeting as [...] "pot-committed... it basically means you put so much money on the bluff, you can't fold your cards". The scene with Kate in a dress was inspired by Raiders of the Lost Ark, where Belloq gives a dress for Marion Ravenwood to wear, and was intended to make [...] "tom-boyish" [...] Kate feel vulnerable. The title, inspired by Charles Dickens' eponymous novel, refers to the reveal of another [...] "city" [...] on the island with the place where the Others live, in addition to the castaways' beach camp. The episode has only three characters of the second season's main cast, Jack, Kate and Sawyer. Lindelof later described this limited scope as [...] "a mistake, when the audience is away from the show for that long, they want to see everybody", causing the following season openers to have scenes with most of the main characters.|$|E
500|$|Asashōryū {{received}} {{criticism from}} Sumo Association {{officials and the}} media throughout his yokozuna career for various other infractions of the strict code of conduct expected of top sumo wrestlers, both on the dohyō and off it. His breaches of etiquette during tournament bouts ranged from merely accepting the prize money with the wrong hand, and raising his arms in victory after clinching the championship, to giving opponents an extra shove after the bout was already over (such as Hakuhō in May 2008), and appealing to judges to overturn the referee's decision. In July 2003, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> fellow Mongolian Kyokushūzan's mage (traditional Japanese top knot) during their bout on day five of the tournament, resulting in an immediate hansoku-make, or disqualification. He was the first yokozuna to be disqualified from a bout. They reportedly brawled in the communal bath afterwards, and Asashōryū was also accused of breaking the wing mirror of Kyokushūzan's car. Some Japanese fans called on him to [...] "go back to Mongolia" [...] after this incident. During the same year, Asashōryū was taking interviews from journalists when he called a Korean journalist a , sparking controversy within South Korean newspapers. He also had an uneasy relationship with his stablemaster Takasago. In July 2004, he apologized after a row with Takasago over his wedding arrangements resulted in him being seen drunk in public and damaging stable property, and his tendency to return to Mongolia without informing his stablemaster led to embarrassments like being unable to attend the funeral of Takasago stable's previous head coach Fujinishiki in December 2003. He was also sometimes seen in public {{in a business suit}} or in casual dress instead of the traditional kimono that wrestlers are expected to wear.|$|E
2500|$|Some graves {{were found}} purely by accident. A farmer {{working in his}} field tripped on a wire {{sticking}} out of the ground. <b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> it to remove it and a skeletal hand popped out of the ground. Other graves were found when people noticed suspiciously green grass in sandy areas. [...] The Da Mai Creek massacre was discovered after three VC defected and told authorities about the murders. [...] An ARVN soldier on patrol south of Hue noticed a wire {{sticking out of the}} ground. Thinking it was a booby trap, he very carefully worked to uncover it. He discovered the body of an old man, his hands tied together with the wire. Two days later 130 bodies had been uncovered.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> {{steadily}} <b>on</b> {{the rope}} and helped her to safety.|$|R
50|$|When Johnston got {{the wire}} then <b>he</b> soon <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> his shoes.|$|R
60|$|Gerald {{waited for}} them to be brought to him. Gudrun came with them. <b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> them <b>on</b> his feet.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> his cap, lurched desperately {{through the}} doorway, and was gone.|$|E
6000|$|... "What do you want? Anything the matter? Wait a moment." [...] <b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> some {{articles}} of clothing, {{and came to}} the door. [...] "Yes?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right," [...] said Oliver, laughing, as <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> the red garments; [...] "they {{are wide}} enough round the waist, at all events. Now for a hat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I want to test {{a little}} theory of mine," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>pulling</b> <b>on</b> his boots. [...] "I think, Watson, that you are now {{standing}} {{in the presence of}} one of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be kicked from here to Charing Cross. But I think I have the key of the affair now." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{finished}} reading {{the letter and}} put it in his coat pocket. Then <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> away <b>on</b> his pipe for a moment.|$|R
50|$|Elmer Fuddstone now appears, spear in hand, and huddles {{low to the}} ground. He {{continues}} on, up into a tree, {{where he}} rips a vine off one branch and ties a loop in one end like a lasso. The looped end he allows to fall to the ground, but when the prehistoric Bugs passes by, <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>on</b> the string and Elmer falls down.|$|R
60|$|After dinner, {{faced with}} the {{ultimate}} experience of his own nothingness, he turned aside. <b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> his boots, put on his coat, {{and set out to}} walk in the night.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'll be switched!" [...] muttered Ike Furner. [...] "Thet's {{the strangest}} thing I ever hear tell on." [...] <b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> his rough beard. [...] "Don't {{remember}} me a' tall?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Syme with {{a forced}} cheerfulness as <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> his trousers, [...] "I dreamt of that {{alphabet}} of yours. Did {{it take you}} long to make it up?" ...|$|E
50|$|During his {{attendance}} of a taping of The Ed Sullivan Show, <b>he</b> was <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> stage by Ed Sullivan, {{who was a}} big boxing fan.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Daddy, {{come and}} talk about cricket!" [...] <b>He</b> was <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> {{the side of the}} bed, and the white figure dived between the sheets.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> his cap <b>on</b> {{and laughed}} in an amused, reassuring way.|$|R
60|$|He {{shoved his}} {{hand under the}} {{headrest}} with caution and presently his fingers {{came into contact with}} a strip of leather and chamois. <b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> it gently, but it refused to budge.|$|E
6000|$|... "You can do {{the first}} shooting," [...] said Dave to his chums. [...] "I'll play bellman." [...] And <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> the side rope, so that the door swung like the {{pendulum}} of a clock.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I say, you're a good 'un," [...] the {{policeman}} remarked as <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> the other man's socks. [...] "Sorry I've {{got to take}} you back to Dawson, but I only 'ope they won't be 'ard on you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Possibly fifty dollars," [...] {{came the}} answer. [...] "Though he's lucky if <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> even <b>on</b> it, {{or if he}} can inveigle a {{publisher}} to risk bringing it out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To--om! To--om!" [...] {{cried the}} elderly woman, with a long, unnatural, {{penetrating}} call that chilled {{her son to}} the marrow. <b>He</b> quickly <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> his boots and his coat.|$|R
5000|$|... 10. Paul: Paul {{is unable}} {{to resist the temptation}} to pull Leslie's pigtails. When <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>on</b> them, Leslie yells out in pain. <b>He</b> <b>pulls</b> one of her pigtails, earning him his name on the board, and then, after a brief {{struggle}} (including a hallucination of the other pigtail talking), <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> the other pigtail, thus earning him a checkmark. He figures that <b>he</b> can <b>pull</b> Leslie's pigtails twice a day with impunity, until Leslie yells out in pain again. Paul's name is then circled and he is sent home early; it is suggested that Paul did not actually pull Leslie's pigtails the third time, and that Leslie's yell was unprovoked so he would go home.|$|R
6000|$|... "That'll do, you needn't {{mind the}} stockings," [...] said Kenneth, as <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> his new garments. [...] "You'll {{find that you}} gain {{considerably}} by the exchange. That's it; now here's a sovereign for you, my fine fellow, and many thanks." ...|$|E
60|$|Questions {{concerning}} the precise nature of Lord Gildoy's hurt could {{wait until they}} were on their way. Whilst <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> his boots, he gave Mrs. Barlow instructions for the day, which included the matter of a dinner he was not destined to eat.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Oh, bother,' said my father, {{preparing}} to get up. 'You're always fancying you hear noises. I believe that's all you women come to bed for--to {{sit up and}} listen for burglars.' Just to satisfy her, however, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> his trousers and socks, and went down.|$|E
6000|$|ANDERSON (busy {{with the}} boots). Going to him! What good would that do? (Growling {{to himself as}} he gets the first boot on with a wrench) I'll go to them, so I will. (To Judith peremptorily) Get me the pistols: I want them. And money, money: I want money--all the money in the house. (He stoops over the other boot, grumbling) A great {{satisfaction}} it would be to him to have my company <b>on</b> the gallows. (<b>He</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>on</b> the boot.) ...|$|R
50|$|Błachowicz was {{expected}} to face Ovince Saint Preux on February 4, 2017 at UFC Fight Night 104. However, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> out <b>on</b> January 21 due to injury {{and was replaced by}} promotional newcomer Volkan Oezdemir.|$|R
6000|$|... ''Tion! Have no fear. I'll come back, {{covered with}} mud and medals. Mind {{you have that}} cup of tea waiting for me.' He is {{listening}} for the whistle. <b>He</b> <b>pulls</b> her <b>on</b> to his knee.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} Dick had the table shoved to one side. Under {{the bottom of}} one of the legs he found a small iron ring, {{connecting}} with the door in the floor. <b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> this and the door came up, showing a small cellar below, used chiefly by the old man for the storage of winter vegetables and the roots he gathered.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I guess y' be, old man. Now keep quiet, or have I got t' make yeh?" [...] {{he asked}} in a {{threatening}} tone which made Albert smile. He wondered if Hartley hadn't been sitting {{up most of the}} night; but if he had, he showed little effect of it, for he began to sing a comic song as <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> his boots.|$|E
60|$|Pan sought his {{blankets}} very late, and {{it seemed}} he scarcely had closed his eyes when Juan called him. It was pitch dark outside. The boys were stirring, the horses pounding, the campfire crackling. <b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>on</b> his boots with a will. Glad he was {{to return to the}} life of camps, horses, cold dawns, hard fare and hard riding. He smelled the frying ham, the steaming coffee.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> {{was just}} <b>pulling</b> <b>on</b> his last boot when a Gymnasium {{official}} {{appeared in the}} doorway.|$|R
60|$|Rachel went unhesitatingly. When {{she reached}} him <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> her down <b>on</b> his knee, {{and she liked}} it.|$|R
50|$|Ziva's {{relationship}} with McGee develops to resemble {{one of a}} brother and sister. While Ziva teases McGee a great deal, often with Tony, they remain on friendly terms (Ziva's teasing is far more playful than Tony's, who takes a much more sadistic approach to the pranks <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>on</b> McGee) and continue to communicate when the team was disbanded between Seasons 5 and 6. He and Abby both urge Ziva to repair her friendship with Tony {{in the aftermath of}} their fallout in the sixth season finale.|$|R
