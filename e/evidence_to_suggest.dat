5|$|As {{platinum}} is {{a catalyst}} {{in the manufacture}} of the silicone rubber and gel components of several types of medical implants (breast implants, joint replacement prosthetics, artificial lumbar discs, vascular access ports, etc.), the possibility that platinum could enter the body and cause adverse effects has merited study. The Food and Drug Administration and other institutions have reviewed the issue and found no <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> toxicity in vivo.|$|E
5|$|Bellinger is {{the only}} Ireland King of Arms known to have made any grants of arms. However two of his four known grants were annulled and or regranted, because their {{recipients}} were within the heraldic jurisdiction of other kings of arms. There is no <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that any Ireland Kings of Arms ever attempted to exercise control over the heraldic practice of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Some {{historians have}} {{suggested}} that the Games were alluded to in playwright William Shakespeare's The Merry Wives of Windsor, and used that as <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that Shakespeare may have seen the Games. But the allusion is not present in the quarto edition of 1602, making its first appearance in the posthumous First Folio of 1623, edited by Henry Condell and John Hemminges. It is therefore uncertain {{whether or not it was}} written by Shakespeare.|$|E

50|$|In {{molecular}} biology mir-200 microRNA {{is a short}} RNA molecule. MicroRNAs function to regulate the expression levels of other genes by binding and cleaving mRNAs or inhibiting translation. The miR-200 family contains miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-141, and miR-429. There are growing <b>evidences</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that miR-200 microRNAs are involved in cancer metastasis.|$|R

5|$|After he was arrested, Gonzalez gave {{permission}} for his vehicle, parked nearby, to be searched. Agents recovered 800 rounds of ammunition, two hatchets, and a machete from the car. Gonzalez {{was ordered to}} be held without bond until a detention hearing on October 1. Less than 24 hours later a 19-year-old man from New Jersey {{was arrested and charged}} with unlawful entry, after he initially tried to enter the White House on foot before returning in a vehicle, which he refused to exit at the checkpoint. There was no <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> the two incidents were related.|$|E
5|$|After {{his release}} on bond, Jernigan {{returned}} to {{the room at the}} Continental Inn in Lexington where he had been living prior to his arrest. On July 18, 1984, Jernigan's son Randy found him dead in the room. An autopsy showed that Jernigan suffered from coronary atherosclerosis, and heart disease was officially listed as the cause of death. Lexington police determined that there was no <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> foul play. Jernigan's ex-wife continued to pursue Jernigan's case against Wilkinson, but a Fayette County Circuit Court Judge awarded Wilkinson a summary judgment to dismiss the case in 1986.|$|E

50|$|The {{mechanism}} by which T7 DNA polymerase senses that a mismatched base has been incorporated is still a topic of study. However, some studies have provided <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggesting</b> that changes in tension of the template DNA strand caused by base-pair mismatch may induce exonuclease activation. Wuite et al. observed that applying tension of above 40 pN to the template DNA resulted in 100-fold increase in exonuclease activity.|$|R
5|$|Between 24 April and 1 May, the IX Army {{fought a}} desperate action {{to break out}} of the pocket in an attempt to link up with the XII Army. Hitler assumed that after a {{successful}} breakout from the pocket, the IX Army could combine forces with the XII Army and would be able to relieve Berlin. There is no <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that Generals Heinrici, Busse, or Wenck thought that this was even remotely strategically feasible, but Hitler's agreement to allow the IX Army to break through Soviet lines allowed many German soldiers to escape to the west and surrender to the United States Army.|$|E
5|$|Consistent {{condom use}} {{reduces the risk}} of HIV {{transmission}} by approximately 80% over the long term. When condoms are used consistently by a couple in which one person is infected, the rate of HIV infection is less than 1% per year. There is some <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that female condoms may provide an equivalent level of protection. Application of a vaginal gel containing tenofovir (a reverse transcriptase inhibitor) immediately before sex seems to reduce infection rates by approximately 40% among African women. By contrast, use of the spermicide nonoxynol-9 may increase the risk of transmission due to its tendency to cause vaginal and rectal irritation.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{reputation}} among his contemporaries for untruth and fantasy, Morrell has been defended by some later commentators who, while questioning his general reliability, maintain {{that not all}} his life was fraud and exaggeration. They believe that aside from the bombast and boastful tone of the account that carries his name, {{there is evidence that}} he carried out useful work, such his discovery of large-scale guano deposits which {{led to the development of}} a full-scale industry. He is believed to have died in 1838 or 1839, in Mozambique; there is, however, <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that this death might have been staged, and that he lived on in exile, possibly in South America.|$|E

5|$|It {{is clear}} that Othelake was no longer enjoying the office by 1420. By this time, John Kitley had been {{appointed}} to the post, though the exact date of his appointment is unknown. He was appointed by King Henry V of England on the insistence of the Earl of Ormonde. There is no <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that Kitley had any connection to Ireland, or even that he visited it, but his connection to Earl of Ormonde is interesting. Kitley was succeeded by Thomas Collyer, who had previously served as Clarenceux King of Arms and Lancaster Herald of Arms in Ordinary. Nothing is known of his career as Ireland, and he was succeeded by Thomas Ashwell.|$|E
5|$|Mental health {{consists}} of a broad scope of measurements of mental well being including depression, stress and measurements of self-worth. Numerous factors affect the prevalence of mental health disorders among women in India, including older age, low educational attainment, fewer children in the home, lack of paid employment and excessive spousal alcohol use. There is also <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that disadvantages associated with gender increase the risk for mental health disorders. Women who find it acceptable for men to use violence against female partners may view themselves as less valuable than men. In turn, this may lead women to seek out fewer avenues of healthcare inhibiting their {{ability to cope with}} various mental disorders.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{different}} genera of oviraptorids {{have been}} found on or near elongatoolithid nests indicating that oviraptorid parents would brood on their eggs, most likely for extended periods of time. There is some <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that oviraptorid and troodontid eggs were cared for by the father, perhaps in a polygamous system. Given the large size of eggs relative to the parent, a mother would only lay two eggs at a time, so the eggs of a single nest may have been contributed by multiple females.|$|E

5|$|On 26 November, {{the detainees}} were deported, {{along with their}} families. Although this was an entirely German initiative—Quisling himself was left unaware {{although}} government assistance was provided—Quisling led the Norwegian public {{to believe that the}} first deportation of Jews, to camps in Poland, was his idea. A further 250 were deported in February 1943, and it remains unclear what the party's official position was on the eventual fate of the 759 Norwegian deportees. There is <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that Quisling honestly believed the official line throughout 1943 and 1944, that they were awaiting repatriation to a new Jewish homeland.|$|E
5|$|Populations of C.australis were {{decimated}} in {{some parts}} of New Zealand because of Sudden Decline. In some areas, particularly in the north, no big trees are left. Although Sudden Decline often affects cabbage trees in farmland and open areas, trees in natural forest patches continue to do well. Trees in the southern North Island and northern South Island are generally unaffected with few dead branches and no symptoms of Sudden Decline.

5|$|Rumours {{of affairs}} did not {{surround}} only Bigge. In 1890, the sculptor Joseph Edgar Boehm died in Louise's presence at his studio in London, leading to rumours {{that the two}} were having an affair. Boehm's assistant, Alfred Gilbert, who {{played a central role}} in comforting Louise after Boehm's death, and supervised the destruction of Boehm's private papers, was rapidly promoted as a royal sculptor. Louise was also romantically linked to fellow artist Edwin Lutyens; her equerry, Colonel William Probert; and an unnamed music master. However, Jehanne Wake, Louise's biographer, argues that there is no substantial <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that Louise had sexual relationships with anyone other than her husband.|$|E

5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{listed the}} pyjama shark as Near Threatened, citing its small {{distribution}} {{and a recent}} increase in fishing pressure on small sharks in the region. However, there is no <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that its population has declined. There are no specific conservation measures in place for this species, though its range encompasses two marine reserves. The South African Sea Fisheries Research Institute is considering legally decommercializing the pyjama shark, which would limit {{the degree to which}} it can be targeted by commercial fisheries.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, the Annals of Tigernach {{states that}} Echmarcach succeeded Ímar. The Annals of the Four Masters specifies that Ímar was driven from the kingship by Echmarcach, {{who was then}} elected king by the Dubliners. After this point in Ímar's life, all that is known for certain is that he died in 1054, as recorded by the Annals of Ulster and the sixteenth-century Annals of Loch Cé. Nevertheless, since these sources style Ímar in Gaelic rí Gall ("king of the foreigners"), there may be <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that, when Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó, King of Leinster (died 1072) drove Echmarcach from Dublin in 1052, Diarmait reinstalled Ímar as king.|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{transaction}} cost theory, this study proposes a research model that links trust, joint manufacturing activities, and supplier flexibility. In this model, supplier dependability trust and financial alignment {{are viewed as}} the key drivers of joint manufacturing activities between manufacturers and suppliers. These joint manufacturing activities, in turn, improve the supplier‟s ability to achieve manufacturing flexibility. Based on 208 responses from the suppliers in the U. S. and China, this study provides empirical <b>evidences</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that supplier dependability trust and financial alignment positively promote manufacturer-supplier joint manufacturing activities. The results also suggest that the joint manufacturing activities enhance supplier flexibility in a significant way...|$|R

It is found that dividend tax cut announcements result in positive abnormal returns. There are <b>evidences</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that REITs with a higher retail and institutional ownership representing the main beneficiaries of these tax cuts are associated with higher cumulative abnormal returns (CARs). It is also found that dividend payout increased significantly during the quarter immediately after the implementation of the first dividend tax cuts. These findings are consistent with the "old view" of dividend taxation which posits that dividend tax cut could affect firms' investment and payout policies...|$|R
