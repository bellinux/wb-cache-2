5|$|A creak is a rapid {{series of}} {{high-frequency}} clicks that sounds somewhat like a creaky door hinge. It is typically used when <b>homing</b> in on prey.|$|E
5|$|<b>Homing</b> pigeons use {{magnetic}} field information with other navigational cues. Pioneering researcher William Keeton showed that time-shifted <b>homing</b> pigeons could not orient themselves correctly {{on a clear}} sunny day, but could do so on an overcast day, suggesting that the birds prefer {{to rely on the}} direction of the sun, but switch to using a {{magnetic field}} cue when the sun is not visible. This was confirmed by experiments with magnets: the pigeons could not orient correctly on an overcast day when the magnetic field was disrupted.|$|E
5|$|In {{research}} {{involved with}} the Grand Challenges in Global Health initiative, Rosetta {{has been used to}} computationally design novel <b>homing</b> endonuclease proteins, which could eradicate Anopheles gambiae or otherwise render the mosquito unable to transmit malaria. Being able to model and alter protein–DNA interactions specifically, like those of <b>homing</b> endonucleases, gives computational protein design methods like Rosetta an important role in gene therapy (which includes possible cancer treatments).|$|E

5|$|As {{microwave}} systems entered service, {{along with}} updated versions of aircraft carrying them, the problem arose {{of what to}} do with those aircraft carrying Mk. IV that were otherwise serviceable. One possibility, suggested as early as 1942, was <b>homing</b> in on the Luftwaffe's own radar sets. The basic operational frequencies of the Luftwaffes counterpart to the Mk. IV, the FuG 202 Lichtenstein BC radar, had been discovered in December 1942. On 3 April 1943 the Air Interception Committee ordered the TRE to begin considering the <b>homing</b> concept under the codename Serrate. As luck would have it, this proved to be perfect timing. In the late afternoon of 9 May 1943, a crew from IV/NJG.3 defected to the UK by flying their fully equipped Ju 88R-1 night fighter, D5+EV, to RAF Dyce in Scotland, giving the TRE their first direct look at the Lichtenstein.|$|E
5|$|<b>Homing</b> on the enemy's {{broadcasts}} {{meant that}} there was no accurate way to calculate the range to the target; radar ranging measurements are based on timing the delay between broadcast and reception, {{and there was no way}} to know when the enemy's signal was originally broadcast. This meant that the <b>homing</b> device could only be used for the initial tracking, and the final approach would have to be carried out by radar. The extra range of the Mk. VIII was not required in this role as Serrate would bring the fighter within easy tracking range, and the loss of a Mk. IV would not reveal the secret of the magnetron to the Germans. For this reason, the Mk. IV was considered superior to the newer radars for this role, in spite of any technical advantages of the newer designs.|$|E
5|$|<b>Homing</b> pigeons have {{occasionally}} {{been used}} throughout history by different cultures. Pigeon post had Persian roots, {{and was later}} used by the Romans to aid their military. Frontinus said that Julius Caesar used pigeons as messengers in his conquest of Gaul.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the series}} {{consists}} of original content featuring new as well as established characters, but the second season is mostly based on the plots of Sonic Adventure and Sonic Adventure 2. While traditionally animated, it includes non-outlined CGI elements for things such as Sonic's <b>homing</b> attack.|$|E
5|$|Peregrine falcons {{handled by}} falconers are also {{occasionally}} used to scare away birds at airports {{to reduce the}} risk of bird-plane strikes, improving air-traffic safety. They were also used to intercept <b>homing</b> pigeons during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Transgenic mice with {{homozygous}} {{depletion of}} NEDD9 are vital and fertile, but have immunological abnormalities {{that result in}} pre-malignant conditions later in life, defects are initially subtle, but increase in later life; B cell <b>homing</b> to the spleen and lymphocyte trafficking are deficient.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{operation}} {{had been a}} failure, it demonstrated the range, flexibility and possibilities of airborne forces and glider operations, and also highlighted equipment failures that were rectified for later operations. This included developing {{a new version of}} the Rebecca-Eureka <b>homing</b> device system, the Mk II, which was ready by 1943 and proved to be very successful when used in later airborne operations; during Operation Market Garden and Operation Varsity, aircraft that used the system reported a 95% success rate.|$|E
5|$|Even at the 1.5m wavelength, antennas of {{practical}} size had relatively low gain and very poor resolution; the transmitter antenna created a fan-shaped signal over 90 degrees wide. This was not useful for <b>homing</b> on a target, so some system of direction indication was required. The team seriously considered phase comparison as a solution, {{but could not}} find a suitable phase shifting circuit.|$|E
5|$|First {{discovered}} in hoverflies in 1995, motion camouflage by minimising optic flow {{has been demonstrated}} in another insect order, dragonflies, {{as well as in}} two groups of vertebrates, falcons and echolocating bats. Since bats hunting at night cannot be using the strategy for camouflage, it has been named, describing its mechanism, as constant absolute target direction. This is an efficient <b>homing</b> strategy, and {{it has been suggested that}} anti-aircraft missiles could benefit from similar techniques.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} Bond stories Fleming gave Bond a battleship-grey Bentley 4½ Litre with an Amherst Villiers supercharger. After Bond's car was written off by Hugo Drax in Moonraker, Fleming gave Bond a Mark II Continental Bentley, {{which he used}} in the {{remaining}} books of the series. During Goldfinger, Bond was issued with an Aston Martin DB Mark III with a <b>homing</b> device, which he used to track Goldfinger across France. Bond returned to his Bentley for the subsequent novels.|$|E
5|$|Later, Dr. Crusher {{reports that}} the other parasites, {{including}} the one inside Quinn, have shriveled up and died, as {{they were unable to}} survive without the mother-creature that had been inhabiting Remmick. As they help to settle matters with Starfleet headquarters, they find that before Remmick was killed, he had sent a signal to a distant quadrant of the galaxy. The signal is thought to be a <b>homing</b> beacon.|$|E
5|$|The Greeks also {{conveyed}} {{the names of}} the victors at the Olympic Games to various cities using <b>homing</b> pigeons. In the early 19th century, the Dutch government used the system in Java and Sumatra. And in 1849, Paul Julius Reuter started a pigeon service to fly stock prices between Aachen and Brussels, a service that operated for a year until the gap in the telegraph link was closed.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of bombers only began {{receiving}} their warning and diversion orders at 00:45 hours. Halifaxes of No. 4 Group were finally alerted at this time. It {{was too late to}} prevent the Ju 88s from sighting, and then <b>homing</b> in on a mass of landing lights. Crews from NJG 2 and NJG 4 were able to deliver beam and Schräge Musik attacks against the unwary crews. Pilots that were alerted in time were able to carry out a corkscrew manoeuvre, and evade the attack. Some bombers were able to land but were then subjected to strafing attacks and destroyed though the crews were presented with a greater chance to escape.|$|E
5|$|As planned, Mayweather boards Horizon and {{receives}} {{a warm welcome}} {{from most of the}} crew, including his mother Rianna. He also finds out that his brother, Paul, has been named acting captain, but he doesn't seem to be coping well with his new responsibilities. Mayweather offers to make a few repairs and upgrades to systems on the ship, but Paul tells him to stop, making him feel uneasy and out of place. Soon afterwards, the ship suddenly comes under attack, and a <b>homing</b> device is placed on the hull. Mayweather then recommends a boost in the ship's fighting capability, but Paul insists that the safest course is to flee to the nearest port and yield the cargo as needed.|$|E
5|$|Cher Ami, a <b>homing</b> pigeon in World War I, {{was awarded}} the Croix de Guerre Medal, by France, with a palm Oak Leaf Cluster for her service in Verdun. Despite having almost lost a leg and being shot in the chest, it managed to travel around twenty-five miles to deliver the message that saved 194 men of the Lost Battalion of the 77th Infantry Division in the Battle of the Argonne, in October 1918. When Cher Ami died, she was mounted and {{is part of the}} {{permanent}} exhibit at the National Museum of American History of the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
5|$|Dead reckoning, {{navigating}} from a known position {{using only}} information about one's own speed and direction, was suggested by Charles Darwin in 1873 {{as a possible}} mechanism. In the 20th century, Karl von Frisch showed that honey bees can navigate by the sun, by the polarization pattern of the blue sky, and by the earth's magnetic field; of these, they rely on the sun when possible. William Tinsley Keeton showed that <b>homing</b> pigeons could similarly make use {{of a range of}} navigational cues, including the sun, earth's magnetic field, olfaction and vision. Ronald Lockley demonstrated that a species of small seabird, the Manx shearwater, could orient themselves and fly home at full speed, when released far from home, provided either the sun or the stars were visible.|$|E
5|$|Drax's henchman Krebs {{is caught}} by Bond {{snooping}} through his room. Later, an attempted assassination by triggering a landslide nearly kills Bond and Brand, as they swim beneath the Dover cliffs. Drax takes Brand to London, where she discovers {{the truth about}} the Moonraker by comparing her own launch trajectory figures with those in a notebook picked from Drax's pocket. She is captured by Krebs, and finds herself captive in a secret radio <b>homing</b> station—intended to serve as a beacon for the missile's guidance system—in the heart of London. While she is being taken back to the Moonraker facility by Drax, Bond gives chase, but is also captured by Drax and Krebs.|$|E
5|$|Free flight {{lasted for}} 10 hours and 29 minutes and was {{followed}} by another 41 hours of bumpy ride with frequent ground contact before the inevitable final crash. The Eagle traveled for 2 days and 3½ hours altogether, during which time, according to Andrée, {{none of the three}} men got any sleep. The definitive landing appears to have been gentle. Neither the men nor the <b>homing</b> pigeons in their wicker cages were hurt, and none of the equipment was damaged, not even the delicate optical instruments and Strindberg's two cameras.|$|E
5|$|From January to April 2009, the Scottish Government {{conducted}} a trial translocation of Eurasian sparrowhawks from around racing pigeon lofts in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Kilmarnock, Stirling and Dumfries. The trial, which cost £25,000, {{was supported by}} the Scottish <b>Homing</b> Union, representing the country's 3,500 pigeon fanciers. The experiment was originally scheduled for early in 2008 but was postponed because it would have impinged on the birds' breeding season. It was criticised by the government's own ecological adviser, Dr Ian Bainbridge, the government body Scottish Natural Heritage and organisations including the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the Scottish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.|$|E
5|$|<b>Homing</b> pigeons {{were used}} {{extensively}} in the 19th and early 20thcenturies, both for civil pigeon post and as war pigeons. In the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, the famous pigeon post of Paris carried up to 50,000microfilmed telegrams per pigeon flight from Tours into the besieged capital. Altogether 150,000 individual private telegrams and state dispatches were delivered. In an 1889 experiment of the Imperial Russian Technical Society at Saint Petersburg, {{the chief of the}} Russian balloon corps took aerial photographs from a balloon and sent the developed collodion film negatives to the ground by pigeon post.|$|E
5|$|<b>Homing</b> transponders {{are similar}} to IFF systems in general terms, but used shorter pulses. When a signal was {{received}} from the radar, the transponder responded with a short pulse on the same frequency, the original radar pulse would not be reflected {{so there was no}} need to lengthen the signal as in the case of IFF. The pulse was sent to the Mk. IV's display and appeared as a sharp blip. Depending on the location of the transponder relative to the aircraft, the blip would be longer on the left or right of the azimuth display, allowing the operator to guide the aircraft to the transponder using exactly the same methods as a conventional aircraft intercept.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{a team of}} {{scientists}} led by the National Institute of Beekeeping in Bologna, Italy, found pollen obtained from seeds dressed with imidacloprid contain significant levels of the insecticide, and suggested the polluted pollen might cause honey bee colony death. Analysis of maize and sunflower crops originating from seeds dressed with imidacloprid suggest large amounts of the insecticide will be carried back to honey bee colonies. Sublethal doses of imidacloprid in sucrose solution have also been documented to affect <b>homing</b> and foraging activity of honey bees. Imidacloprid in sucrose solution fed to bees in the laboratory impaired their communication for a few hours. Sublethal doses of imidacloprid in laboratory and field experiment decreased flight activity and olfactory discrimination, and olfactory learning performance was impaired.|$|E
5|$|In the Atlantic, escort {{carriers}} {{proved to}} be a vital part of Allied convoys, increasing the effective protection radius and helping to close the Mid-Atlantic gap. Carriers were also more economical than battleships because of the relatively low cost of aircraft and their not requiring to be as heavily armoured. Submarines, which had {{proved to be}} an effective weapon during the First World War, were anticipated by all sides to be important in the second. The British focused development on anti-submarine weaponry and tactics, such as sonar and convoys, while Germany focused on improving its offensive capability, with designs such as the Type VII submarine and wolfpack tactics. Gradually, improving Allied technologies such as the Leigh light, hedgehog, squid, and <b>homing</b> torpedoes proved victorious.|$|E
5|$|It was {{powered by}} two {{turbofan}} engines with each {{in a separate}} engine nacelle with S-ducts, to shield engine axial compressors from radar waves, {{on either side of}} the aircraft's spine. Of the two aircraft built, the first YF-23 (PAV-1) was fitted with Pratt & Whitney YF119 engines, while the second (PAV-2) was powered by General Electric YF120 engines. The aircraft featured fixed engine nozzles, instead of thrust vectoring nozzles as on the YF-22. As on the B-2, the exhaust from the YF-23's engines flowed through troughs lined with heat-ablating tiles to dissipate heat and shield the engines from infrared <b>homing</b> (IR) missile detection from below.|$|E
5|$|Large {{sections}} of the game feature a car which resembles a gutted-and-rebuilt 1969 Dodge Charger. It {{appears to have been}} tuned for performance. A radar system is installed later in the game, allowing the player to locate Rebel supply caches. In the final battle, a rear-mounted storage rack for Magnusson Devices is added and the radar is adjusted to track enemies and Magnusson Device dispensers. A <b>homing</b> unit is also installed so the player can quickly locate the car in the chaos of the final battle via a readout in the Hazardous Environment suit.|$|E
5|$|Only {{insects that}} live in nests or colonies {{demonstrate}} any true capacity for fine-scale spatial orientation or <b>homing.</b> This can allow an insect to return unerringly to a single hole a few millimeters in diameter among thousands of apparently identical holes clustered together, after a trip of up to several kilometers' distance. In a phenomenon known as philopatry, insects that hibernate have shown the ability to recall a specific location {{up to a year}} after last viewing the area of interest. A few insects seasonally migrate large distances between different geographic regions (e.g., the overwintering areas of the monarch butterfly).|$|E
5|$|Orientation {{behaviour}} {{studies have}} been traditionally carried out using variants of a setup known as the Emlen funnel, which consists of a circular cage with the top covered by glass or wire-screen so that either the sky is visible or the setup is placed in a planetarium or with other controls on environmental cues. The orientation behaviour of the bird inside the cage is studied quantitatively using the distribution of marks that the bird leaves {{on the walls of}} the cage. Other approaches used in pigeon <b>homing</b> studies make use of the direction in which the bird vanishes on the horizon.|$|E
5|$|Pigeon {{photography}} is an aerial photography technique invented in 1907 by the German apothecary Julius Neubronner, who also used pigeons to deliver medications. A <b>homing</b> pigeon was fitted with an aluminium breast harness {{to which a}} lightweight time-delayed miniature camera could be attached. Neubronner's German patent application was initially rejected, but was granted in December 1908 after he produced authenticated photographs taken by his pigeons. He publicized the technique at the 1909 Dresden International Photographic Exhibition, and sold some images as postcards at the Frankfurt International Aviation Exhibition and at the 1910 and 1911 Paris Air Shows.|$|E
