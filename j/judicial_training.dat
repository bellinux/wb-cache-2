The Hague Permanent Bureau’s Guide to Good Practice {{indicates that}} central authority staff should be “sufficient in numbers {{to cope with}} the workload” (Guide to Good Practice on Central Authority Performance, § 2.4.1). In the USCA’s view, the MCA needs more staff in order to comply with Convention requirements, and Mexico needs to allocate more resources to enhance <b>judicial</b> <b>training</b> programs to improve judges’ understanding of the Convention, to establish procedures to process applications in the absence of implementing legislation, and to improve Mexican law enforcement’s ability to locate missing children.|$|E

25|$|The USCA {{has raised}} these {{issues with the}} MCA and the Embassy of Mexico in {{on-going}} meetings and conversations since the 2001 Report.

In response, the MCA acknowledged the need to improve its implementation of the Convention but other than improved communication no significant change has occurred. The Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs raised our concerns about the implementation of the Convention in Mexico at the Binational Commission meetings in November 2002. The Binational Working Group agreed to work together to ensure passage of implementing legislation and to promote <b>judicial</b> <b>training</b> aimed at improving compliance with the Convention.

The U.S. Embassy and Consulates in Mexico have worked closely throughout the year with Mexican officials and judges to explain roles and obligations under the Convention. [...] Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs Maura Harty has repeatedly raised U.S. Government concerns over Mexico’s compliance problems with senior Mexican officials, including during the November 2004 Binational Commission meetings and during Secretary of State Rice’s first trip to Mexico in March 2005. [...] Mexican judges participated in Department-sponsored training and conferences, including a December 2004 Latin American Judicial Seminar, at which judges from 19 countries shared experiences and worked through cases studies using Convention principles. [...] Nevertheless, the MCA has not taken a sufficient lead to broaden the amount of <b>judicial</b> <b>training</b> offered within its borders.|$|E
