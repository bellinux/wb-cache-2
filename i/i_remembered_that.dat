Beristain uses the Arri Alexa digital camera, along with Leica Lenses and silk-stocking diffusion nets, the latter on which he recalled [...] "I had last used in the 1980s in England on videos and commercials. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> they were fantastic. In combination with the Leica lenses, the look is very classic, {{very much like a}} 1940s film. When I saw it, I said, 'This is absolutely Marvel,' and [...] agreed." [...] For the series' lighting, Beristain again mixed modern and traditional, using LED fixtures to recreate classic Hollywood lighting. He called his lighting of Atwell [...] "an homage to the great cinematographers who lit Lauren Bacall and Grace Kelly." ...|$|E

When I finished that project, my long time best friend, Becky Cloonan was contacted by Tokyopop to send a pitch proposal. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> I had been asked to send one as well, so we briefly considered sending a joint proposal for Off Beat (at the time she had talked about possibly working on the project with me). Her schedule got booked though, so I wasn't sure about submitting the pitch on my own. She encouraged me to go ahead though, so I went for it." ...|$|E
