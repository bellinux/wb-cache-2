40|$|This {{article is}} {{a brief review of}} dry etching as applied to pattern transfer, {{primarily}} in silicon technology. It focuses on concepts and topics for <b>etching</b> <b>materials</b> of interest in micromechanics. The basis of plasma-assisted etching, the main dry etching technique, is explained and plasma system configurations are described such as reactive ion etching (RIE). An important feature of RIE is its ability to achieve etch directionality. The mechanism behind this directionality and various plasma chemistries to fulfil this task will be explained. Multi-step plasma chemistries are found to be useful to etch, release and passivate micromechanical structures in one run successfully. Plasma etching is extremely sensitive to many variables, making etch results inconsistent and irreproducible. Therefore, important plasma parameters, mask materials and their influences will be treated. Moreover, RIE has its own specific problems, and solutions will be formulated. The result of an RIE process depends in a non-linear way on a great number of parameters. Therefore, a careful data acquisition is necessary. Also, plasma monitoring is needed for the determination of the etch end point for a given process. This review is ended with some promising current trends in plasma etching...|$|E

Thirty-two teeth were exposed to laser energy for 25 s: 16 teeth at 100 mj setting and 16 teeth at 150 mj setting. Sixteen teeth were etched with 37 % phosphoric acid. The shear bond strength of bonded brackets with the Transbond XT adhesive system was measured with the Zwick testing machine. Descriptive statistics, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, of homogeneity of variances, one- way analysis of variances and Tukey′s test and Kruskal Wallis were used to analyze the data. Results: The mean shear bond strength of the teeth lased with 150 mj was 12. 26 ± 4. 76 MPa, which was not significantly different from the group with acid etching (15. 26 ± 4. 16 MPa). Irradiation with 100 mj resulted in mean bond strengths of 9. 05 ± 3. 16 MPa, which was significantly different from that of acid etching (P < 0. 001).

The use of preparatory techniques including bur introduction to the fissures is considered among such improving steps. The aim of this investigation was to compare the microleakage level of fissure sealants prepared by a fissurotomy bur or pumice prophylaxis prior to acid <b>etching.</b> <b>Materials</b> and Methods: Ninety freshly extracted healthy maxillary premolar teeth were randomly selected for this investigation. Teeth were then divided into three fissure sealant preparatory groups of A: Fissurotomy bur + acid etch; B: Pumice prophylaxis + acid etch and C: Acid etch alone. Sealant was applied to the occlusal fissures of all specimens using a plastic instrument. This was to avoid any air trap under the sealant. Sample teeth were first thermocycled (1000 cycles, 20 s dwell time) and then coated with two layers of nail varnish leaving 2 mm around the sealant. This was then followed by immersion in basic fuchsin 3 %. Processed teeth were sectioned longitudinally and examined under a stereomicroscope for microleakage assessment using a score of 0 - 3. Collected data was then subjected to Kruskall-Wallis Analysis of Variance and Mann-Whitney U-test. P < 0. 05 was considered as significant. Results: Teeth in fissurotomy bur and pumice prophylaxis groups had significantly reduced level of microleakage than those in acid etch alone (P = 0. 005 and P = 0. 003, respectively). Conclusion: Use of fissurotomy bur and pumice prophylaxis accompanied with acid etching appears to have a more successful reduction of microleakage than acid etch alone...|$|E

40|$|Background: Acid etching of tooth {{surfaces}} {{to promote}} the bonding of orthodontic attachments to the enamel has been a routine procedure in orthodontic treatment since the 1960 s. Various types of orthodontic etchants and etching techniques have been introduced {{in the past five}} decades. Although a large amount of information on this topic has been published, there is a significant lack of consensus regarding the clinical effects of different dental etchants and etching techniques. Objectives: To compare the effects of different dental etchants and different etching techniques for the bonding of fixed orthodontic appliances. Search methods: We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 8 March 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 2), MEDLINE via OVID (to 8 March 2013), EMBASE via OVID (to 8 March 2013), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (to 12 March 2011), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to 8 March 2013) and the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials Registry (to 8 March 2013).

40|$|Atomic {{control of}} thin film growth and removal is {{essential}} for semiconductor processing. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a thin film deposition technique {{that is based on}} self-limiting surface reactions that deposit thin conformal films with atomic scale precision. The ALD of metal fluorides has been limited by the difficulty of handling the hydrogen fluoride (HF) precursor that is necessary for metal fluoride film growth. The use of HF-pyridine as an HF reservoir has allowed the development of metal fluoride ALD processes such as AlF 3, LiF, lithium ion conducting (AlF 3) (LiF) x alloy, ZrF 4, HfF 4, MnF 2, MgF 2, and ZnF 2. AlF 3 ALD was studied using trimethylaluminum (TMA) and HF at temperatures from 150 - 300 °C by in situ techniques such as quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), quadrupole mass spectrometry (QMS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Ex situ characterization of the films was conducted using X-ray reflectivity (XRR) and spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE), grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS). These high quality metal fluoride ALD films will be useful for many applications such as optical coatings and Lewis acid catalysts. ”Reverse ALD”, i. e. atomic layer etching (ALE), is a film removal technique that is able to remove thin films with atomic level control. Current ALE processes based on halogen adsorption and ion-enhancement are inherently directional processes that lead to an anisotropic removal of material. New thermal approaches for Al 2 O 3 and HfO 2 ALE were demonstrated using Sn(acac) 2 and HF as the reactants. In situ and ex situ studies showed that thermal ALE of Al 2 O 3 and HfO 2 is possible at temperatures from 150 - 250 °C. In the proposed reaction mechanism, the HF reactant fluorinates the metal oxide surfaces to form the corresponding metal fluoride and H 2 O as reaction products. The Sn(acac) 2 reactant induces a ligand exchange reaction to produce volatile SnF(acac) and Al(acac) 3 or Hf(acac) 4. This etching approach based on fluorination and ligand exchange is general and can be applied to other metal oxides, as well as metal nitrides, metal phosphides, metal arsenides and elemental metals. Thermally driven ALE processes will provide an important tool for isotropically <b>etching</b> <b>materials</b> at the atomic scale...|$|E

This scatter is potentially threatening the behavior and reliability of samples from a batch fabrication process, motivating the development of non-deterministic computational approaches to predict the MEMS properties. In this work we extract the meso-scale properties of the poly-silicon material under the form of a probabilistic distribution. To this end, Statistical Volume Elements (SVE) of the micro-structure are generated under the form of a Voronoï tessellation with a random orientation for each silicon grain. Hence, a Monte-Carlo procedure combined with a homogenization technique allows a distribution of the material tensor at the meso-scale to be estimated. As the finite element method is used to discretize the SVE and to solve the micro-scale boundary value problem, the homogenization technique used to extract the material tensor relies on the computational homogenization theory.
