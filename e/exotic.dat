5|$|Although not as {{significant}} as deforestation and hunting, some lemurs, such as crowned lemurs and other species that have successfully been kept in captivity, are occasionally kept as <b>exotic</b> pets by Malagasy people. Bamboo lemurs are also kept as pets, although they only survive {{for up to two}} months. Live capture for the <b>exotic</b> pet trade in wealthier countries is not normally considered a threat due to strict regulations controlling their export.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{there are}} over 200 <b>exotic</b> species known to live in Redwood National and State Parks. Of these thirty have been {{identified}} as invasive species, ten of these are considered threats to local species and ecosystems. <b>Exotic</b> species currently account for {{about a quarter of the}} total flora in the parks. Only about one percent of plant growth in old-growth areas are of <b>exotic</b> species, while areas such as the Bald Hills prairies have a relative cover of fifty to seventy-five percent <b>exotic.</b> The type of foreign vegetation also varies, with plants such as the English Ivy (Hedera helix), Spotted Knapweed (Centaurea maculosa), and the Poison Hemlock (Conium maculatum). The spotted knapweed and poison hemlock are both under consideration for addition to a high priority watch list maintained by the park system.|$|E
5|$|Non-native plants {{sometimes}} threaten {{native species}} by using up nutrient resources.

Generally, most <b>exotic</b> species are controlled by pulling the plants out of the soil or by spraying, {{both of which are}} time consuming and expensive.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} gauge coupling unification in E 6 F-Theory Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) where E 6 {{is broken}} to the Standard Model (SM) gauge group using fluxes. In such models {{there are two}} types of <b>exotics</b> that can affect gauge coupling unification, namely matter <b>exotics</b> from the matter curves in the 27 dimensional representation of E 6 and the bulk <b>exotics</b> from the adjoint 78 dimensional representation of E 6. We explore the conditions required for either the complete or partial removal of bulk <b>exotics</b> from the low energy spectrum. In the latter case we shall show that (miraculously) gauge coupling unification may be possible even if there are bulk <b>exotics</b> at the TeV scale. Indeed in some cases it is necessary for bulk <b>exotics</b> to survive to the TeV scale in order to cancel the effects coming from other TeV scale matter <b>exotics</b> which would by themselves spoil gauge coupling unification. The combination of matter and bulk <b>exotics</b> in these cases can lead to precise gauge coupling unification which would not be possible with either type of <b>exotics</b> considered by themselves. The combination of matter and bulk <b>exotics</b> at the TeV scale represents a unique and striking signature of E 6 F-theory GUTs that can be tested at the LHC. Comment: 21 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

40|$|A {{major goal}} and {{challenge}} of invasion ecology {{is to describe}} and interpret spatial and temporal patterns of species invasions. Here, we examined fish invasion patterns at four spatially structured and hierarchically nested scales across the contiguous United States (i. e., from large to small: region, basin, watershed, and sub-watershed). All spatial relationships in both richness and fraction between species groups (e. g., natives vs. <b>exotics)</b> were positive at large scales. However, contrary to predictions using null/neutral models, the patterns at small scales were hump-shaped (unimodal), not simply negative. The fractions of both domestic (introduced among watersheds within the USA) and foreign (introduced from abroad) <b>exotics</b> increased with area across scales but decreased within each scale. The foreign <b>exotics</b> exhibited the highest dominance (lowest evenness) and spatial variation in distribution, followed by domestic <b>exotics</b> and natives, although on average natives still occupy larger areas than domestic and foreign <b>exotics.</b> The results provide new insight into patterns and mechanisms of fish species invasions at multiple spatial scales in the United States...|$|R

5|$|As {{the fields}} of ecology and {{environmental}} studies develop, <b>exotic</b> species attract more attention and their effects become more apparent. Mid-20th century biology texts about invading species reflected more complacency than alarm, as contemporary wisdom about them assumed the host environment would be largely immune. Everglades biologist Thomas Lodge writes that in the 1960s, evidence of non-native plant and animal life in South Florida was present but not particularly worthy of notice. Over the past decades, however, the number of <b>exotic</b> species and their spread has increased dramatically.|$|E

5|$|Much more ancient {{than the}} {{upstream}} mountains are the <b>exotic</b> terranes of the Klamath Mountains to the west. Not until plate tectonics separated North America from Europe and North Africa {{and pushed it}} westward did the continent acquire, bit by bit, what became the Pacific Northwest, including Oregon. The Klamath Mountains consist of multiple terranes—former volcanic islands and coral reefs and bits of subduction zones, mantle, and seafloor—that merged offshore over vast stretches of time before colliding with North America as a single block about 150 to 130million years ago. Much of the Rogue River watershed, including the Rogue River canyon, the Kalmiopsis Wilderness, the Illinois River basin, and Mount Ashland, are composed of <b>exotic</b> terranes.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) {{constructed}} from F-theory have been extensively studied {{due to the}} substantial scope for model building and phenomenology which they provide. This thesis will motivate and introduce the basic tools required for model building {{in the setting of}} local F-theory. Starting with GUT groups of E 6, SO(10) and SU(5), a group theoretic dictionary between the three types of theory is formulated, which provides considerable insight into how to build a realistic model. The spectral cover formalism is then applied to each case, enabling the possible low energy spectra after flux breaking of the GUT group to be found. Using these results an E 6 based model is constructed that demonstrates, for the first time, {{that it is possible to}} construct a phenomenologically viable model which leads to the MSSM at low energies. In addition to the MSSM model, the E 6 starting point is also used to build F-theory models in which the low energy supersymmetric theory contains the particle content of three 27 dimensional representations of the underlying E 6 gauge group, with the possibility of a gauged U(1) group surviving down to the TeV scale. The models with TeV scale <b>exotics</b> initially appear to be inconsistent due to a splitting of the gauge couplings at the unification scale which is too large, and incompatible with the formalism. However, in E 6 models with flux breaking, there are bulk <b>exotics</b> coming from the 78 dimensional adjoint representation which are always present in the spectrum, and it turns out that a set of these <b>exotics</b> provide a natural way to achieve gauge coupling unification at the one-loop level, even for models with TeV <b>exotics.</b> This motivates a detailed study of bulk <b>exotics,</b> where specific topological formulae determining the multiplicities of bulk states are investigated, and the constraints imposed by these relations applied to the spectra of the models previously studied. In particular, bulk <b>exotics</b> are relevant to the almost miraculous restoration of gauge coupling unification in the case of the models with TeV scale <b>exotics.</b> The consistent local F-theory models with low energy <b>exotics</b> have distinctive characteristics when compared with other, similar models, and so provide potential opportunities to be tested at the LHC...|$|R

5|$|The {{river was}} {{formerly}} a food source with yabbies, mussels and small fish, however {{the reduction in}} water quality, changing of the river's habitat, and introduction of European fish species {{has led to a}} reduction in fauna quantity and diversity. <b>Exotic</b> pest species such as the European carp, redfin perch and trout have greatly reduced native fish populations like the big headed gudgeon (Philypnodon grandiceps) but native waterfowl are common along the river with Pacific black ducks, Australian wood ducks, black swans, ibis, egrets and herons amongst the more than 100 species seen.
