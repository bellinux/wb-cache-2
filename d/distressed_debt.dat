25|$|Corporate {{transactional}} events generally {{fit into}} three categories: distressed securities, risk arbitrage, and special situations. Distressed securities include such events as restructurings, recapitalizations, and bankruptcies. A distressed securities investment strategy involves {{investing in the}} bonds or loans of companies facing bankruptcy or severe financial distress, when these bonds or loans are being traded at a discount to their value. Hedge fund managers pursuing the <b>distressed</b> <b>debt</b> investment strategy aim to capitalize on depressed bond prices. Hedge funds purchasing <b>distressed</b> <b>debt</b> may prevent those companies from going bankrupt, as such an acquisition deters foreclosure by banks. While event-driven investing in general tends to thrive during a bull market, distressed investing works best during a bear market.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{beneficial}} economic consequences and market and accounting based valuation effects of troubled debt restructurings (TDR) in financially distressed debtor firms. Relying on {{the implications of}} prior research and extant valuation theories, some empirical evidence on the beneficial outcomes and informativeness of TDR is first provided: significantly positive restructuring interval excess returns and higher excess returns to subsequently consummated restructurings and subsequent survivors. The market reaction to “full-settlement” and “modification of terms” types of TDR are also measured to evaluate {{the consistency of the}} FASB's binary classification and recognition criteria with the market participants' assessments. Finally, a valuation model conditional on book values and earnings is used to test the value relevance of the reported financial statement bottom lines and TDR related disclosure. The findings suggest that modifications are at least as beneficial and informative as full settlements. Hence, the recognition of the reduction in the liability and the related gain in the financial statements of firms that undertake modifications would be more congruent with the valuation effects assessed by market participants.

Inoue et al. (2008) also showed that, compared to out-of-court settlements in the United States, agreements on out-of-court restructuring are attained more easily in Japan. However, widespread forbearance by banks and affiliated companies in addressing the needs of distressed firms indicated a serious weakness of banks and affiliated companies in instituting discipline. This is the first empirical study to examine the performance of Japanese firms that experienced out-of-court restructuring in Japan from January 1990, when the bubble economy burst, to March 2005, when the Koizumi Cabinet declared the bad debt problems of major firms to be resolved. Our results show that important biases permitted deeply unprofitable firms to survive in Japan. This finding is similar to research by Hotchkiss (1995), who analyzed post-restructuring performance in the United States. We also find that out-of-court restructurings of troubled firms in Japan were less effective in improving profitability than restructurings under Chapter 11 in the United States. However, we find that restructurings associated with new capital injections and new outside management are more likely to lead to genuine improvement in financial performance.

40|$|The authors {{respond to}} Dunn, Gilbert, and Wilson (2011) and offer {{additional}} {{ideas about how}} to apply the virtue of thrift to obtain greater affective benefit from spending less. Materialism and over-consumption is damaging for the individual, the economy, and the environment. Over consumption is understandable in light of hedonic adaptation, where the happiness arising from a positive change erodes via two key pathways: diminishing positive emotions and rising aspirations. In the U. S., hedonic adaptation encourages overspending and indebtedness. The practice of thrift is the wise and efficient use of resources, and there are many thrifty proponents and adherents throughout history—including Socrates, King Solomon, Confucius, Benjamin Franklin, and today, Warren Buffett. Studies suggest that individuals would spend less and derive more hedonic benefit by eliminating <b>distressing</b> <b>debts,</b> stretching positive experiences through appreciation and savoring, recycling positive experiences via variety and reminiscing, renting instead of buying, and resolutely focusing on intrinsic goals over extrinsic ones.
