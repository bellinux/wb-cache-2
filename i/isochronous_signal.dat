40|$|We present design {{details and}} new {{measurements}} {{of the performance of}} fast electronics for the Forward Multiplicity Detector for ALICE. These detectors based on sector type Microchannel Plates (MCP) forming several disks gave the very first trigger decision in the experiment (L 0). Fast passive summators integrated with the detectors are used for linear summation of up to eight <b>isochronous</b> <b>signal</b> channels from MCP pads belonging to one sector. Two types of microelectronics design thin film summators were produced. We present test results for these summators, working in the frequency range up to 1 Ghz. New low noise preamplifiers have been built to work with these summators. The new design shows a good performance with the usable frequency range extended up to 1 Ghz. An upgrade of the functional scheme for the L 0 ALICE pre-trigger design is also presented. Abstract: List of figures Figure 1 : ALICE L 0 Trigger Front-End Electronics Functional Scheme.

40|$|Biospheric {{relationships}} between {{production and consumption}} of biomass have been resilient {{to changes in the}} Earth system over billions of years. This relationship has increased in its complexity, from localised ecosystems predicated on anaerobic microbial production and consumption, to a global biosphere founded on primary production from oxygenic photoautotrophs, through the evolution of Eukarya, metazoans, and the complexly networked ecosystems of microbes, animals, fungi and plants that characterise the Phanerozoic Eon (the last ~ 541 million years of Earth history). At present, one species, Homo sapiens, is refashioning this relationship between consumption and production in the biosphere with unknown consequences. This has left a distinctive stratigraphy of the production and consumption of biomass, of natural resources, and of produced goods. This can be traced through stone tool technologies and geochemical signals, later unfolding into a diachronous signal of technofossils and human bioturbation across the planet, leading to stratigraphically almost <b>isochronous</b> <b>signals</b> developing by the mid- 20 th century. These latter signals may provide an invaluable resource for informing and constraining a formal Anthropocene chronostratigraphy, but are perhaps yet more important as tracers of a biosphere state that is characterised by a geologically unprecedented pattern of global energy flow that is now pervasively influenced and mediated by humans, and which is necessary for maintaining the complexity of modern human societies.

40|$|Abstract. Actions {{carried out}} in {{response}} to exogenous stimuli and actions selected endogenously {{on the basis of}} intentions were compared in terms of their behavioral (movement timing) and electrophysiological (EEG) profiles. Participants performed a temporal bisection task that involved making left or right key presses at the midpoint between <b>isochronous</b> pacing <b>signals</b> (a sequence of centrally-presented letters). In separate conditions, the identity of each letter either (1) prescribed the location of the subsequent key press response (stimulus-based) or (2) was determined by the location of the preceding key press, in which case participants were instructed to generate a random sequence of letters (intention-based). The behavioral results indicated that stimulus-based movements occurred earlier in time than intention-based movements. The EEG results revealed that activity reflecting stimulus evaluation and response selection was most pronounced in the stimulus-based condition, whereas activity associated with the general readiness to act was strongest in the intentionbased condition. Together, the behavioral and electrophysiological findings provide evidence for two modes of action planning, one mediated by stimulus-response bindings and the other by action-effect bindings. The comparison of our results to those of an earlier study (Waszak et al., 2005) that employed spatially congruent visuo-motor mappings rather than symbolic visuo-motor mappings suggests tha...|$|R

40|$|A multiplexer/demultiplexer {{system has}} been {{developed}} to enable the transmission, over a single channel, of four data streams generated {{by a variety of}} sources at different (including variable) bit rates. In the original intended application, replicas of this multiplexer/demultiplexer system would be incorporated into the spacecraft-to-ground communication systems of the space shuttles. The multiplexer of each system would be installed in the spacecraft, where it would acquire and process data from such sources as commercial digital camcorders, video tape recorders, and the spacecraft telemetry system. The demultiplexer of each system would be installed in a ground station. Purely terrestrial systems of similar design could be attractive for use in situations in which there are requirements to transmit multiple streams of high-quality video data and possibly other data over single channels. The figure is a block diagram of the multiplexer as configured to process data received via three fiber-optic channels like those of the International Space Station and one electrical-cable channel that conforms to the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) 1394 standard. (This standard consists of specifications of a high-speed serial data interface, the physical layer of which includes a cable known in the art as "FireWire. " An IEEE 1394 interface can also transfer power between the components to which it is connected.) The fiber-optic channels carry packet and/or bit-stream signals that conform to the standards of the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS). The IEEE 1394 interface accepts an <b>isochronous</b> <b>signal</b> like that from a digital camcorder or a video tape recorder. The processing of the four input data streams to combine them into one output stream is governed by a statistical multiplexing algorithm that features a flow-control capability and makes it possible to utilize the transmission channel with nearly 100 -percent efficiency. This algorithm allocates the available bandwidth of the transmission channel to the data streams according to a combination of data rates and preassigned priorities. Incoming data streams that demand too much bandwidth are blocked. Bandwidth not needed for a transmission of a given data stream is allocated to other streams as available. Priority is given to the IEEE 1394 stream. In addition to the four incoming data streams, the multiplexer transmits data on the status of the system. An operator can monitor and control the multiplexer via displays and controls on the multiplexer housing. The output of the multiplexer is connected via a coaxial cable with an impedance of 50 Ohms to an interface circuit compatible with the space-shuttle high-speed digital downlink, which operates at a rate of 48 Mb/s...|$|E
