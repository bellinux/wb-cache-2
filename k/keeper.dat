5|$|Dungeon <b>Keeper</b> {{took over}} two years to develop, and an {{expansion}} pack, a Direct3D version, and a level editor were released.

40|$|The passive {{surveillance}} of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in domestic poultry is based essentially on {{the reporting of}} suspicious clinical cases by the poultry <b>keepers</b> to the veterinary services. As little was known about HPAI disease awareness among Swiss poultry <b>keepers,</b> a cross-sectional study was conducted among poultry <b>keepers</b> in Switzerland in 2007. For data triangulation and complementary information, interviews have been conducted with experts of poultry marketing organizations. The main information source used by the poultry <b>keepers</b> was mass media. Having a non-commercial poultry husbandry {{was significantly associated with}} lower knowledge scores. Non-commercial poultry <b>keepers</b> felt neglected by the veterinary authorities. Risks perceived by the poultry <b>keepers</b> reflected well the officially communicated risks for HPAI introduction. By highlighting the needs and the knowledge level of the poultry <b>keepers,</b> we make recommendations with regard to more efficient information exchange between poultry <b>keepers</b> and veterinary authorities. The main challenge will be to consistently integrate non-commercial poultry <b>keepers</b> in the formal information channel...|$|R
