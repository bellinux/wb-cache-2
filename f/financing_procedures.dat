40|$|Although the {{development}} process is often ill defined and somewhat intangible, there is a definite rationale to the methodology employed to effectuate the creation of our built environment.

The health care system in Ukraine is cumbersome and outdated. It is based on the Semashko model with rigid management and <b>financing</b> <b>procedures.</b> The disadvantages accumulated in the national health care system due to lack of modernization, disregard of the population needs, non-use of modern global trends, the inefficient operation of the system and the high level of corruption cause the underlying situation. The decision of new government policy in the sector is introduction of new financial mechanisms, in order to ensure human rights in the health sector. Methodology. The study is based on a comparison of systems of financing of medicine in Ukraine and in other countries, provided advantages and disadvantages of each model. Results showed that the availability of medical services is the key problem in any society. The availability of health care services is primarily determined by the proportion of services guaranteed by the government (government guarantees). In some countries such as the United States, practically the whole medicine is funded by voluntary health insurance (VHI). In Europe the mandatory health insurance (MHI) and government funding are the most significant source of funds. Practical importance. The improvement of the demographic situation, the preservation and improvement of public health, improvement of social equity and citizens' rights in respect of medical insurance. Value/originality. Premiums for health insurance are the source of funding. Based on the new model requirements it is necessary to create an appropriate regulation, which would determine its organizational and regulatory framework. This process is primarily determined by identification and setting rules governing the relationship between patients, health care providers and insurers, creation of the conditions and the implementation of quality assurance mechanisms and the availability of medical care in accordance with the available resources and the expectations of patients.

40|$|AbstractIt was {{shortly before}} the end of World War II (1944) that the {{decision}} was taken to establish the Bretton Woods institutions, namely the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). A few years later (1948), the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted by the UN, according to which education was at last offic ially established as a human right for the first time throughout human history. Upon the end of WW II, the creation of International Institutions aiming princ ipally at imp lementing polic ies towards economic development came to the fore. Given that collaboration is more effective if it takes place through multilateral institutions, the International Institutions gradually emerged as important regulators of the global scene, setting or influenc ing international developments at various levels. At the same time, the content of education, the structure of the educational system and the implemented education policies were regarded as key factors influencing economic growth. In this way, economy was directly related to education while education was in its turn d irectly linked to development programs. There are many international institutions intervening in education policy matters. The action taken by some of them is widely known while others’ action is not, since the fields they get invo lved in are prima facie not related to education issues. The less known institutions inc lude the IMF and, secondarily, the IBRD. The role of the IBRD is more active and vis ible while the invo lvement of the IMF is ind irect, through its involvement in the <b>financing</b> <b>procedures</b> of the WB. The present paper will attempt to examine the ro le p layed by the IBRD and the IMF in cultivating and diffus ing specific education policies and ideas as well as the value bases on which their education programs develop. The vast majority of the International Institutions dealing with education do not form a specific self-contained policy promoted by the member states themselves since they are not capable of enforcing specific measures. They usually define specific goals and create an attractive atmosphere around them. These goals are subsequently promoted through the mesh of relationships and partnerships they have been develop ing. The particularity of the Bretton Woods Institutions lies in their ability to impose specific measures on the states. While promoting their positions through financial programs, rendering their implementation an integral part of financ ing, they in fact enforce the implementation of specific education policies. This fact attaches great importance to the role they play with regard to education at a global level since they may be the only International Institutions possessing the ability to directly exert education policies...|$|E
40|$|Presented at the GLOBELICS 6 th International Conference 2008 22 - 24 September, Mexico City, Mexico. Collaboration with {{university}} {{and other public}} research organisations seems to have become increasingly important for firms, as the technological interdisciplinarity and complexity, and the competitive pressures to shorten product life increased (Hagedoorn, 1996; Caloghirou et al., 2003). By collaborating with universities, firms may reduce uncertainty inherent from the innovation process, as well as expand their markets, access to new or complementary resources and skills, keep up with evolution of scientific knowledge, and create new technological learning options on future technologies (Hagedoorn et al., 2000; Lee, 2000; Fritsch and Lukas, 2001). In particular, in the new industrialized countries (NIC), as their economy and their technological capabilities improve, national public research and educational organisations (PREOs) are expected to play an increasing important role in supporting indigenous firms to move into more dynamic and higher-opportunity industries (Mathews and Hu, 2007; Mazzoleni and Nelson, 2007; Wu, 2007). Indeed, firms (especially small firms) active in high-technology sectors were found to achieve higher productivity through university-industry collaboration (Motohashi, 2005). Consequently, following the innovation policies of developed countries, governments in the new industrialised countries are launching policies fostering science-industry interactions {{and the development of}} high-technology sectors (Wong et al, 2007; Gouvea and Kassicieh, 2007). In Brazil, policy-makers are engaged in improving the technological capabilities of national firms and in developing high-technology industries, especially biotechnology, nanotechnology, renewable energies and information and communication technologies (Gouvea and Kassicieh, 2007; Brazilian Government, 2003). The adoption of OECD best-practices in technology transfer policies, such as TTOs, IPR of university results, support to spin off creation, might be per se inefficient to support university-industry collaboration and the growth of national high-technology sectors (Najmabadi and Lall, 1995; Goldman et al., 1997; OECD, 2005). The design and implementation of appropriate science and technology policies require in-depth information on the national context and characteristics of universityindustry collaboration. In particular, the understanding of the differences in the characteristics of PROEs collaboration with firms active in mature and emergent sectors is required. However, few studies have explored this issue. This paper is an attempt to fill this gap, and provide evidence supporting science and technology policy in Brazil. This paper analyses the evolution and context of science- industry collaboration, in Brazil. In particular, it investigates the motivations, goals, outputs, and main barriers and facilitators of that collaboration. In particular, the paper explores the specificities of university-industry collaboration in emergent sectors, such as biotechnology, nanotechnology, and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), when compared to collaboration in mature sectors. Moreover, it analyses how PREOs have engaged in organisational change to encourage cooperation with industry, for example through the development of assistance services and adaptation of incentives. To undertake this research, we use data from face-to- face interviews with a sample of 24 coordinators of research groups at PREOs. This paper shows that in Brazil, informal and professional academic network of contacts with firms in emergent sectors is underdeveloped; students {{play a major role in}} mediating {{university and}} industry interaction. Moreover, the major national public research sponsors seems not to have yet adapted their <b>financing</b> <b>procedures</b> to finance projects of firms active in emergent sectors. This paper suggests that public support to university-industry collaboration through adoption of the OECD best practices of technology-transfer policies is not per se enough to encourage the development and growth of national high-technology activities. This paper is organised as follow. Section 2 reviews the literature on the role of PREOs on the process of catching up and in the growth of high- technology sectors. Section 3 reviews the context of university- industry interaction in Brazil. Section 4 presents the data and methodology used in this paper. Section 5 explores the pattern of the university- industry collaboration in Brazil in terms of motivations, objectives and output of collaboration, as well as the efforts of PREOs to provide assistance services and incentives for researchers to cooperate with industry. Moreover, differences in the specificities of university collaboration with firms active in emergent and mature sectors are examined. Section 6 concludes the paper...|$|E

40|$|For the {{shipbuilding}} market, {{the financing}} issue constitutes the main cornerstone – it is {{a starting point}} for every newbuilding. Generally, financing of new vessels can be divided into two phases, pre-delivery finance and post-delivery finance. However, there is no clear-cut division between those phases and often the last phase is mere prolongation of the former one. Nevertheless, in cases, where the financing prior to respectively after delivery and acceptance of the vessel is obtained from different lenders, the usual procedure is to separate those two phases. When it concerns legal aspects of the shipbuilding financing, such as shipbuilding contract, its registration and mortgaging such division plays a significant role. The builder, who usually is a contractual owner of the vessel until delivery, bears the risk of loss or damage prior to delivery and acceptance thereof. It affects the buyer’s positions as a potential owner of the future vessel and as a borrower in relation to the bank financing the buyer’s purchase of newbuilding. Under the pre-delivery phase there is no vessel and the only ground for providing financing and foreseeing the economic life of the vessel-to-be and future incomes is the shipbuilding contract followed by drawings. The capital costs of a ship and the choice of financing are the crucial factors for success of the project.
