40|$|The {{objective}} of the European Library (TEL) project [TEL] was {{to set up a}} co-operative framework and specify a system for integrated access to the major collections of the European national libraries. This has been achieved by successfully applying a new approach for search and retrieval via URLs (SRU) [ZiNG] combined with a new metadata paradigm. One aim of the TEL approach is to have a low barrier of entry into TEL, and this has driven our choice for the technical solution described here. The solution comprises portal and client functionality running completely in the browser, resulting in a low implementation barrier and maximum scalability, as well as giving users control over the search interface and what collections to search. In this article we will describe, step by step, the development of both the search and retrieval architecture and the metadata infrastructure in the <b>European</b> <b>Library</b> <b>project.</b> We will show that SRU is a good alternative to the Z 39. 50 protocol and can be implemented without losing investments in current Z 39. 50 implementations. The metadata model being used by TEL is a Dublin Core Application Profile, and we have taken into account that functional requirements will change over time and therefore the metadata model will {{need to be able to}} evolve in a controlled way. We make this possible by means of a central metadata registry containing all characteristics of the metadata in TEL. Finally, we provide two scenarios to show how the TEL concept can be developed and extended, with applications capable of increasing their functionality by "learning" new metadata or protocol options...|$|E

40|$|The <b>European</b> <b>Library</b> <b>Project</b> (TEL), {{sponsored}} by the European Commission, brings together 10 major European national libraries and library organisations to investigate the technical and policy issues involved in sharing digital resources. The objective of TEL {{is to set up}} a co-operative framework, which will lead to a system for access to the major national and deposit collections in European national libraries. In this presentation I will discuss the development of a metadata model and the development of an interoperability testbed. This testbed will offer distributed searching in the national collections via Z 39. 50 alongside searching a central index of metadata harvested from other collections via the Open Archives Initiative protocol (OAI-PMH). Access to this central index is offered via SRU - a new protocol for search and retrieval based on http and XML initiated by the Z 39. 50 Implementers Group as a low barrier alternative to Z 39. 50. The major challenges in the technical work of this project are related to the diversity of collections, languages and local services. From a user perspective TEL hopes to meet these challenges by lowering the barrier for users to access the different collections by offering metadata searches integrated in a central index, not just a menu of web sites and we hope to offer translations of search terms and facilitate searching on names by providing access to different name authority databases. From a provider perspective we hope to lower the barrier to participate in TEL by using simple protocols and by facilitating conversions. And from a library perspective we hope to share machine-readable metadata by developing a common metadata model and vocabularies with tools that allow for an ongoing evolution. TEL will offer access to different services like multilingual services, name authority services and links to local services. One of the keys to meet the above challenges is integration: metadata generated by each service should be usable when accessing other services. This requires a common understanding of metadata, an easy way to carry metadata from one service to other services and an easy way to associate related metadata. It will be discussed how the TEL metadata development, resulting in a TEL Application Profile, dynamically generated links and integrated indexing of different types of metadata will contribute to fulfil those requirements. With name authorities as an example it will be demonstrated how this contributes to bringing new services within a “one mouse click distance”. Integrated object metadata and name authority search will help the user in finding main entries rather than telling the user that his search resulted in no hits. A pan-European "Central Name Authority File", as being one {{of the results of the}} LEAF project can contribute in the realisation of these valuable services...|$|E

A preparatory project, part funded by the European Union, ran from January 2001 until January 2004. Because of the diverse nature and missions of the participating libraries, developing a coherent business plan was a significant challenge. It appears that business planning for digital libraries, with some exceptions, is not hitherto well documented. This paper describes the research process carried out, the harmonisation of business objectives leading to the final business plan and some observations on the process. status: publishe...|$|R
