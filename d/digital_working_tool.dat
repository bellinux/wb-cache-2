40|$|Swedish preschools have {{a variety}} of {{children}} of different ethnic origins. The intention of this thesis is twofold; firstly to deeply examine how preschool teachers work with languages and secondly how to integrate the Swedish language with other native languages in practice. Hence, the aim is to get a deeper understanding and knowledge about how to integrate multilingual children that have other languages than Swedish as their mother tongue. The data collection for this dissertation is based on observations and interviews with three preschool teachers and child minders. The theoretical background is taken from literature which describes the social cultural perspective. The key words used in this dissertation are: Identity, intercultural, multicultural, participation, language arena. During our empirical studies we noticed similarities between Vygotsky’s social cultural perspective and the different terms that we used in our analysis. Our findings show that the tools that the pedagogues should use in order to integrate multilingualism in operations are the childrens daily routines, planed way of <b>working,</b> <b>digital</b> <b>tools</b> and good collaboration with the parents. The study also shows that pedagogues can take advantage of their multilingual skills...|$|R

40|$|During operation, hot <b>working</b> <b>tools</b> are {{subjected}} to thermal, mechanical and tribological stress. This results in high abrasive and adhesive wear, which limits the tools' lifetime. The lifetime can be prolonged by appropriate surface treatments. This paper describes investigations on the combination of laser alloying or laser dispersing with a nitriding process. The target has been to increase the life time of hot <b>working</b> <b>tools,</b> more precisely of forging tools. Samples and selected forging tools were laser alloyed/dispersed {{in order to reduce}} the abrasive wear. The samples were subsequently nitrided to decrease the adhesive wear. The effect of this duplex treatment of surfaces was determined via the evaluation of each single process as well as their combination. Two special testing devices were developed to simulate the wear on hot <b>working</b> <b>tools.</b> A modified disc on disc test apparatus was especially suited to simulate thermal shock and mechanical wear of duplex treated hot <b>working</b> <b>tool</b> steels. By this, information on the properties and quality of the described duplex treatment was obtained within a few hours, instead of a long term testing period under real service conditions. Investigations using standard metallographic methods and micro hardness testing as well as microanalysis have been performed in addition...|$|R

Article contains the general description of structural and hydro- kinematical schemes of a hydraulic hammer with automatic control of frequency of influences depending on loading on the <b>working</b> <b>tool.</b> The objectives have to be achieved by introduction of the regulator of a stream of working liquid in the control unit.

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{deals with}} {{cryogenic}} treatment and cryogenic treatment combined with nitriding of hot <b>working</b> <b>tool</b> steels. Unlike traditional steel cold treatment generally {{conducted at the}} temperatures of about- 70 °C for several hours, cryogenic treatment at the temperature of about minus- 180 °C for several dozen hours was performed. Basing on a dilatometric and differential thermal analysis (DTA) the authors made an attempt to explain the process of changes resulting from cryogenic treatment. In addition, the authors, basing on test results, discussed comparatively the effect of cryogenic treatment on the resistance to wear at high temperatures and on the hot <b>working</b> <b>tool</b> steel hardness. The presented results confirm the rise of material durability of drop forging dies after cryogenic treatment or nitriding combined with cryogenic treatment...|$|R

40|$|The {{motion of}} the weeding disc at any point {{on the surface of}} a rotary tiller travels was studied. Parametric {{equations}} were used to describe the motion of path followed by the weeding tines. The effective performance of soil <b>working</b> <b>tool</b> was related to the kinematic parameter of the soil <b>working</b> <b>tools,</b> the forward travel distance and speed of the rotary tines and working action of components of weeding tool. The design parameters for appropriate soil <b>working</b> <b>tools</b> and implements were established. The weeder consists of a 5 hp-petrol engine, three ground wheels (pneumatic), tool assembly, frame and handle. The construction of the powered rotary weeder was done in the workshop of the Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering, University of Ilorin, Ilorin, Nigeria. The performance of the weeder was investigated by considering the effects of four (4) weeding tools (Iron rod tine, Cable tine, Line yard tine and Plastic strand tine) and three (3) levels of weeding speeds (1804 rpm, 2435 rpm, 3506 rpm) on the weeding index, weeding efficiency and field capacity. The data were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) using a 4  3 factorial experiment in a randomized complete block design. The analysis of results indicated that the forward speeds of 0. 4 m/s to 0. 5 m/s and engine speeds of 1804 rpm to 2261 rpm resulted in weeding efficiency of 54. 98...|$|R
