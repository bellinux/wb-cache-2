The more widely environmentally distributed compounds perfluoro- 1 -octane sulfonate, perfluorooctanoic acid, and perfluorononanoic acid did not seem to possess this hormone-dependent proliferation capacity. We investigated cell cycle dynamics using flow cytometric analyses of the DNA content of the nuclei of MCF- 7 breast cancer cells. Exposure to both <b>fluorotelomer</b> <b>alcohols</b> stimulated resting MCF- 7 cells to reenter the synthesis phase (S-phase) of the cell cycle. After only 24 hr of treatment, we observed significant increases in the percentage of cells in the S-phase. In order to further investigate the resemblance of the newly detected xenoestrogens to the reference compound 17 β-estradiol (E 2), gene expression of a number of estrogen-responsive genes was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. With E 2, as well as 4 -nonylphenol and the <b>fluorotelomer</b> <b>alcohols,</b> we observed up-regulation of trefoil factor 1, progesterone receptor, and PDZK 1 and down-regulation of ERBB 2 gene expression.

A multispecies version of the SimpleBox model, which is capable of determining {{the fate of a}} chemical and its degradation products, was developed for this purpose. An uncertainty analysis on the chemical-specific input parameters was performed to examine for uncertainty in modeled concentrations. In 2005, residual 8 : 2 FTOH made up 80 % of the total contribution of FTacrylate use to PFO concentrations in global oceans, and residual PFOA in FTacrylate contributed 15 % to PFO concentrations from FTacrylate use in global oceans. After hundreds of years, however, the main source of PFO from total historical FTacrylate production is predicted to be FTacrylate degrading in soil following land application of sludge from sewage treatment plants, followed by FTacrylate still present in landfills. Uncertainty in modeled PFO concentrations was up to a factor of 3. 3.

Fluorinated organic compounds were investigated in archived extracts collected from remote locations in Okinawa, Japan (HSO) and Mount Bachelor, Oregon (MBO) during the springs of 2004 (MBO and HSO) and 2006 (MBO only). These high volume air samples were subjected to pressurized liquid extraction, concentrated, and analyzed by GC/MS. FtOHs were measured in both HSO and MBO air masses, though MBO had significantly higher concentrations. We identified fluorotelomer olefins (in HSO air) and 8 : 2 fluorotelomer acrylate (in MBO 2006 air) {{for the first time}} in published literature. N-Ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamide (N-EtFOSA), N-Methyl perfluorooctane sulfonamido ethanol (N-MeFOSE), and N-Ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamido ethanol (N-EtFOSE) were measured in HSO and MBO air masses, but detected less frequently than FtOHs. 6 : 2 fluorotelomer acrylate, perfluorooctane sulfonamido acrylates, perfluorobutane sulfonamide, and perfluorobutane sulfonamido ethanol were not detected in any air samples from this study. For MBO 2006, the sources of <b>fluorotelomer</b> <b>alcohols</b> were investigated using HYSPLIT back trajectories, residual fluorinated product signatures, and correlations with semi-volatile organic compounds (SOCs). FtOH concentrations during MBO 2006 were not significantly correlated (p-value > 0. 05) with the amount of time an air trajectory spent in a specific source region such as California, Washington, Oregon, and Canada. Since FtOH concentrations were significantly correlated (p-value < 0. 05) with each other, the average ratio of 6 : 2 FtOH to 8 : 2 FtOH to 10 : 2 FtOH during MBO 2006 was calculated to be 1. 0 (0. 1) to 5. 0 (0. 7) to 2. 5 (0. 4), where the parenthesis represent 95 % confidence intervals. Also, FtOH concentrations at MBO 2006 were positively correlated (p-value < 0. 5) with gas-phase PAHs and PCBs and negatively correlated (p-value < 0. 05) with agricultural pesticides such as endosulfan. This suggests that FtOHs are coming mainly from urban sources. Atmospheric residence times from MBO 2006 data for 6 : 2 FtOH, 8 : 2 FtOH, and 10 : 2 FtOH, based on a method using trace gas variability, were calculated to be 50, 80, and 70 days, respectively.

The polyfluorinated compounds, namely 6 : 2 <b>fluorotelomer</b> <b>alcohol</b> (6 : 2 FTOH), 8 : 2 <b>fluorotelomer</b> <b>alcohol</b> (8 : 2 FTOH) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), are widespread anthropogenic compounds, {{used in a}} variety of consumer products due to their water-, grease- and stain-repellent property. Levels of PFOA in human blood are typically around 5 ppb (0. 01 μM), while FTOHs so far not have been measured in human samples due to technical difficulties. One of the main effect of PFOA in laboratory animals and in in vitro experiments is an induction of peroxisomal proliferation, leading to increased oxidation of fat, changed expression of a variety of genes, and increased cell proliferation, possibly inducing cancer development, both in the liver and in the pancreas and testicle. PFOA is also a reproductive toxicant, changes membrane architecture, and inhibits the effluent transporter Pgp. Several {{of the effects of the}} FTOHs are similar to those observed after PFOA exposure and several of the genes that show altered expression after PFOA exposure are also changed after exposure to 8 : 2 FTOH. Effects of 8 : 2 FTOH exposure include hepatocellular necrosis and peroxisomal proliferation, as well as detrimental effects on development in mice. Both 6 : 2 and 8 : 2 FTOH have been shown to act as xenoestrogens in vitro. We evaluated the effect of 6 : 2, 8 : 2 FTOH and PFOA on testicular cells from Wistar rats. Testicular cells were exposed in vitro to concentrations up to 300 μM for one hour. No signs of cytotoxicity were observed. The level of single strand breaks, abasic sites and oxidized purines was not increased, either. Whether the expression of the breast cancer resistant protein (Bcrp 1) was altered, remains unsure due to high variability between experimental runs. One major weakness in these experiments is the use of a relatively short exposure time, making it very difficult to draw conclusions. Since the tested concentrations are many magnitudes higher than exposure in the general population, the data have nonetheless predictive value. Taken together, the results suggest that the tested PFCs do not exhibit testicular toxicity. The brominated compound 1, 2 -dibromo- 3 -chloropropane (DBCP) is known to induce permanent or temporary infertility in men, in addition to being a renal toxicant. It also induced DNA damage and acts as a clastogen and mutagen, inducing cancer development. The DNA inducing effect of DBCP on three testicular cell types was evaluated; Sertoli cells and other somatic cells seem to be the most sensitive cell type, spermatogonia the least sensitive, and spermatids seem to have a medium sensitivity. However whether the results obtained in experiments with somatic cells are correct is quite uncertain due to prolonged perincubation time. The repair capacity in spermatogonia and spermatids was also examined; spermatogonia were found to repair DNA damage induced by DBCP somehow faster than spermatids. Taken together, the results suggest that it may be the supporting cells like Sertoli cells that get heaviest damaged by DBCP. The damage in these cells can then lead to impaired germ cell development by interfering with the supply of nutrition, testosterone and other supporting functions. Spermatogonia appear to be least sensitive and repair the induced DNA damage relatively effectively. Since these cells are located outside of the blood-testis barrier these efficient defense mechanisms are very meaningful...|$|E
40|$|Polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl {{substances}} (PFASs), in {{the forms}} of neutral polyfluoroalkyl substances in the gas phase of air and ionic perfluoroalkyl substances in the dissolved phase of surface water, were investigated during a sampling campaign in the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, and Yangtze River estuary in May 2012. In the gas phase, the concentrations of neutral Sigma PFASs were {{within the range of}} 76 - 551 pg/m(3). Higher concentrations were observed in the South Yellow Sea. 8 : 2 <b>fluorotelomer</b> <b>alcohol</b> (FTOH) was the predominant compound as it accounted for 92 %- 95 % of neutral Sigma PFASs in all air samples. Air mass backward trajectory analysis indicated that neutral Sigma PFASs came mainly from the coast of the Yellow Sea, including the Shandong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces of China, and the coastal region of South Korea. The fluxes of gas phase dry deposition, were simulated for neutral PFASs, and neutral Sigma PFASs fluxes varied from 0. 37 to 23 pg/m(2) /s. In the dissolved phase of the surface water, concentrations of ionic Sigma PFASs ranged from 1. 6 to 118 ng/L, with the Bohai Sea exhibiting higher concentrations than both the Yellow Sea and the Yangtze River estuary. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was the predominant compound accounting for 51 %- 90 % of the ionic Sigma PFAS concentrations. Releases from industrial and domestic activities as well as the semiclosed geographical conditions increased the level of ionic Sigma PFASs in the Bohai Sea. The spatial distributions of perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and perfluoroalkane sulfonic acids (PFSAs) were different significantly. The Laizhou Bay was the major source region of PFCAs and the Yangtze River estuary was the major source of PFSAs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{contamination}} {{levels and}} patterns of perfluoroallcyl acids (PFAAs) and their precursors in indoor air of children's bedrooms in Finland, Northern Europe, were investigated. Our study {{is among the most}} comprehensive indoor air monitoring studies (n = 57) and to our knowledge the first one to analyse air in children's bedrooms for PFASs (17 PFAAs and 9 precursors, including two acrylates, 6 : 2 FTAC and 6 : 2 FTMAC). The most frequently detected compound was 8 : 2 <b>fluorotelomer</b> <b>alcohol</b> (8 : 2 FTOH) with the highest median concentration (3570 pg/m(3)). FTOH concentrations were generally similar to previous studies, indicating that in 2014 / 2015 the impact of the industrial transition had been minor on FTOH levels in indoor air. However, in contrast to earlier studies (with one exception), median concentrations of 6 : 2 FTOH were higher than 10 : 2 FTOH. The C 8 PFAAs are still the most abundant acids, even though they have now been phased out by major manufacturers. The mean concentrations of FOSE/As, especially MeFOSE (89. 9 pg/m(3)), were at least an order of magnitude lower compared to previous studies. Collectively the comparison of FTOHs, PFAAs and FOSE/FOSAs with previous studies indicates that indoor air levels of PFASs display a time lag to changes in production of several years. This is the first indoor air study investigating 6 : 2 FTMAC, which was frequently detected (58 %) and displayed some of the highest maximum concentrations (13 000 pg/m(3)). There were several statistically significant correlations between particular house and room characteristics and PFAS concentrations, most interestingly higher EtFOSE air concentrations in rooms with plastic floors compared to wood or laminate.

40|$|Polyfluoroalkyl {{compounds}} (PFCs) {{were determined}} in high-volume air samples during a ship cruise onboard the Canadian Coast Guard Ship Amundsen crossing the Labrador Sea, Hudson Bay and the Beaufort Sea of the Canadian Arctic. Five PFC classes (i. e. perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs), polyfluoroalkyl sulfonates (PFSAs), <b>fluorotelomer</b> <b>alcohols</b> (FTOHs), fluorinated sulfonamides (FOSAs), and sulfonamidoethanols (FOSEs)) were analysed separately {{in the gas}} phase collected on PUF/XAD- 2 sandwiches and in the particle phase on glass-fibre filters (GFFs). The method performance of sampling, extraction and instrumental analysis were compared between two research groups. The FTOHs were the dominant PFCs in the gas phase (20 - 138 pg m(- 3)), followed by the FOSEs (0. 4 - 23 pg m(- 3)) and FOSAs (0. 5 - 4. 7 pg m(- 3)). The PFCAs could only be quantified in the particle phase with low levels (FOSAs (similar to 9 %) > FTOHs (similar to 1 %). Significant positive correlation between Sigma FOSA concentrations in the gas phase and ambient air temperature indicate that cold Arctic surfaces, such as the sea-ice snowpack and surface seawater could be influencing FOSAs in the atmosphere...|$|R
40|$|Perfluoroalkyl {{aldehydes}} (PFAlds) and n: 2 fluorotelomer aldehydes (FTAlds) are {{degradation products}} of precursor compounds that include <b>fluorotelomer</b> <b>alcohols,</b> iodides, acrylates, phosphate esters, and other derivatives, {{as well as}} hydrofluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons. The SPARC software program and comparative density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to investigate the aqueous phase hydration equilibrium constants (K~hyd~) of PFAlds and FTAlds. DFT studies suggest that all PFAlds will be dominantly present as the hydrated form in aqueous solution. While SPARC correctly estimates the K~hyd~ for the C~ 1 ~ PFAld, it appears to incorrectly predict a large decline in K~hyd~ (particularly between C~ 1 ~ and C~ 2 ~) with increasing perfluoroalkyl chain length for this class of compounds. Both SPARC and DFT investigations suggest that FTAlds will not likely be substantially hydrated in aquatic systems or in vivo. Using corrected SPARC estimates, PFAld hydrates {{are expected to have}} pK~a~ values in the range of phenols (ca. 9 to 10), whereas n: 2 FTAld hydrates are expected to have pK~a~ values ca. 2 to 3 units higher (ca. 12 to 13). Where relevant, the molecular and/or dissociated hydrate forms of PFAlds and FTAlds need to be explicitly considered in environmental, toxicological, and waste treatment investigations...|$|R
40|$|Poly- and perfluoroalkyl {{substances}} (PFASs) are {{a family}} of anthropogenic chemicals widely used in the commercial and industrial applications due to their unique properties of stability, hydrophobicity and lipophobicity. Traditionally, PFASs are produced via two major manufacturing processes; electrochemical fluorination (ECF) and telomerization. Due to their persistence, toxicity and bioaccumulation, ECF-associated chemicals perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), its salts and perfluorooctane sulfonyl fluoride (POSF) are placed into the Annex B of the Stockholm Convention (SC) on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) in 2009. The ECF production has also been phased out gradually in the developed countries. However, the production of <b>fluorotelomer</b> <b>alcohols</b> (FTOHs) by telomerization has increased significantly. Recent {{studies have demonstrated that}} the biotransformation and abiotic transformation of FTOHs yielded perfluocarboxylic acids (PFCAs), which may be router for the ubiquitous distribution of PFCAs. Besides, some of the FTOHs intermediate metabolites have been demonstrated to be able to covalently bind with various biomolecules and thereby cause serious toxicity, while the final metabolites are showed to cause hepatotoxicity and renal toxicity. Recently, the environmental problems related to FTOHs have become the hotspots in environmental science, toxicology and epidemiology. This paper reviews the research progress on the production status, environmental occurrence, and the toxicities of FTOHs and the related metabolites. Finally, the currently existing problems and trends are discussed...|$|R
