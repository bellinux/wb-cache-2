Those were his very words; and then he says that if he really cares for you, he'll be sure to come back again, and so you're to answer the letter, and you must call him Dear Mr. Rowan. Don't call him Luke, because young men think so much about those things. And you are to tell him that there isn't to be any engagement, or any letter-writing, or anything of that sort at all. But you can <b>just</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> friendly,--about hoping he's quite well, or something of that kind. And then when you come to the end, you had better sign yourself 'Yours truly.' It won't do to say anything about affection, because one never knows how it may turn out. And,--let me see; there was only one thing more. Mr. Comfort says that you are a good girl, and that he is sure you have done nothing wrong,--not even in a word or a thought; and I say so too. You are my own beautiful child; and, Rachel,--I do so wish I could make it all right between you." ...|$|E

5000|$|For example, when Peter says [...] "I {{promise to}} do the dishes" [...] in an {{appropriate}} context then he thereby does not <b>just</b> <b>say</b> <b>something,</b> and in particular he does not describe what he is doing; rather, in making the utterance he performs the promise; since promising is an illocutionary act, the utterance is thus a performative utterance. If Peter utters the sentence without the intention to keep the promise, or if eventually he does not keep it, then although something is not in order with the utterance, {{the problem is not}} that the sentence is false: it is rather [...] "unhappy", or [...] "infelicitous", as Austin also says in his discussion of so-called felicity conditions. In the absence of any such flaw, on the other hand, the utterance is to be assessed as [...] "happy" [...] or [...] "felicitous", rather than as [...] "true". Austin dropped this distinction in favour of a distinction between explicit performatives ("I promise it will never happen again") and primary or implicit performatives ("It will never happen again," [...] functioning as a promise).|$|E

40|$|In this {{interest}} of time, I’ll <b>just</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> directly: {{this is an}} incredible book. Reading it, thinking it through, is extremely rewarding. I haven’t read a work of philosophy that had as much impact on me since being in school myself. The book presents you with new ideas and connections and it forces you to see philosophy and its history in new ways, even if you (like me) had been quite attached to your old ways. The book got into my head. Now I find myself, in idle moments, arguing with Paul up there in my head; {{as if there is}} a little copy of him in there now, making the case for his versions of inferentialism and cognitive contextualism. Fortunately, Paul is in my experience unfailingly nice, generous and sympathetic even in argument—otherwise it might not be as nice to have a copy of him in your head. Still, the copy pales in comparison to the original, so it is great to be here. I can’t do justice to the book. But I will try to proceed as follows. I will try to sketch the general line of thought I find so powerful. Then, I will try to take up my assigned role as critic. The most stimulating thing I can think of to do is to argue as follows: Paul’s arguments concerning Kant and Hegel are largely successful, but end up pushing us in directions that are not consistent with the general approach to philosophy, and the general approach to Kant and Hegel, from which Paul himself begins. So we should abandon that general approach. That is what I will try, at least, to argue...|$|E

They’re very smart, intelligent animals, and Seaworld keeps them in these little pools {{the size of a}} bathtub to us. These are huge animals that are used to swimming more than 100 miles per day and they’re in this little bathtub, and it’s like, “What the fuck?” Blackfish kind of pointed out that this is barbaric and it’s super old school.
