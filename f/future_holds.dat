5|$|Lisa imagines she and all {{the other}} Springfield Elementary {{students}} are Hebrews in ancient Egypt, with the Pharaoh (Principal Skinner) making them build a pyramid. Only Moses (Milhouse) can liberate the Hebrews. When Bart defaces the Pharaoh's sarcophagus, supposedly incited by the burning bush, he gets the other students punished. Lisa helps Milhouse produce plagues to scare the Pharaoh into freeing the Israelites; they fail. This in turn gets Lisa and Milhouse thrown in a Pyramid prison. When they escape, Milhouse gathers all the students and they attempt to leave. When they reach the sea, Lisa has an idea to get across: They simultaneously flush all the Egyptians' toilets to drain the sea. As they cross, the Pharaoh and his guards follow, but the water fills the sea back up and swallows them. They enjoy splashing each other, and then return to the shore. Pleased that they have escaped, Milhouse asks Lisa what the <b>future</b> <b>holds</b> for the Israelites, but Lisa disappoints Milhouse when she says that they have to wander the desert for forty years. Milhouse then asks if {{it is going to be}} smooth sailing for the Jews after that. Rather than disappoint Milhouse again with news of the ongoing anti-Semitism that will plague the Jews for many centuries, she distracts the crowd by sending them to search for manna.|$|E

500|$|The cover art by Hugh Syme {{features}} {{an elderly woman}} hanging babies by their feet on a seemingly endless clothesline. According to bassist David Ellefson, the artwork concept was directly inspired from a line of the title track, [...] "We've been hung out to dry". He explained that the title track [...] "was probably the strongest representation of how we feel about {{the young people who}} listen to our music and what their <b>future</b> <b>holds</b> for them. It's like you have a choice, you can become proactive or you can choose 'Youthanasia'." [...] The title is a combination [...] of the words [...] "youth" [...] and [...] "euthanasia". Mustaine has stated that the idea for the title stems from hearing about Jack Kevorkian, as well as the declining state of well-being of young people, specifically referring to issues like drugs, crime and violence, and a lack of parenting.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrasting}} Miles with Peter Parker, Bendis has depicted different {{conflicts and}} anxieties for the character. Right after acquiring his superhuman abilities from a spider bite {{at the home}} of his uncle, Aaron, whom Miles admires but he does not initially know is a career criminal, Miles' father, Jefferson, explains to Miles that before Miles was born, Jefferson and Aaron were thieves who spent time in prison, and that while Jefferson reformed when he got older, Aaron has not. According to Bendis, this gives Miles cause to wonder if the traits that lead to criminal behavior are hardwired into his DNA, leading him to question whether he is essentially a good person or not, and what his <b>future</b> <b>holds</b> for him. These issues further haunt Miles after he becomes disillusioned with Aaron, and Aaron dies from an accidental explosion triggered during a battle between the two of them, saying, [...] "You are just like me" [...] to Miles before dying.|$|E

500|$|Eidelman {{stated that}} he finds science fiction the most {{interesting}} and exciting genre to compose for, and that Meyer told him to treat the film as a fresh start, rather than drawing on old Star Trek themes. Eidelman wanted the music to aid the visuals; for Rura Penthe, he strove to create an atmosphere that reflected the alien and dangerous setting, introducing exotic instruments for color. Besides using percussion from around the world, Eidelman treated the choir as percussion, with the Klingon language translation for [...] "to be, or not to be" [...] ("taH pagh, taHbe") being repeated in the background. Spock's theme {{was designed to be}} an ethereal counterpart to the motif for Kirk and the Enterprise, aimed at capturing [...] "the emotional gleam in the captain's eye". Kirk's internal dilemma about what the <b>future</b> <b>holds</b> was echoed in the main theme: [...] "It's Kirk taking control one last time and as he looks out into the stars he has the spark again [...] But there's an unresolved note, because it's very important that he doesn't trust the Klingons.

Will Ryan, writing for Beats per Minute, called the record's four songs to be the some of the best club tracks of all time, labeling it a [...] "complete statement that overloads all possible cylinders, as vital as the ages of the producers behind it might suggest, delivered by a duo whose rise can only just qualify as meteoric". Sherburne, when interviewing Disclosure for Spin magazine, honored the EP as the duo's [...] "best and most varied" [...] release, noting its production to be [...] "yielding a high-end that’s filigreed with crystal and compression so pneumatic that it seems to suck the air from your lungs".|$|E

[...] Rumours and speculations claiming Minogue had undergone plastic surgery to make her bottom look more appealing also began to arise during this time. In the same year, English broadcaster and journalist Johnny Vaughan commented [...] "if an alien landed on Earth he would think Kylie's arse is the world's leader." [...] Minogue's stylist and close friend William Baker explained his decision to [...] "showcase" [...] her bottom in the video, saying [...] "Kylie's bottom is like a peach - sex sells and her best asset is her bum."
