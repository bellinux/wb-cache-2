2500|$|The Tweedie {{convergence}} theorem {{provides a}} hypothetical {{explanation for the}} wide manifestation of fluctuation scaling and 1/f noise. It requires, in essence, that any exponential <b>dispersion</b> <b>model</b> that asymptotically manifests a variance to mean power law will be required express a variance function that comes within the domain of attraction of a Tweedie model. [...] Almost all distribution functions with finite cumulant generating functions qualify as exponential dispersion models and most exponential dispersion models manifest variance functions of this form. [...] Hence many probability distributions have variance functions that express this asymptotic behavior, and [...] the Tweedie distributions become foci of convergence {{for a wide range}} of data types.|$|E

Instead, the cohort of 96,000 was selected based on severe, moderate, and mildly affected areas based on death rates. [...] Prior versions of the technical report characterised the area as ‘affected’ but later versions contained confusing and contradictory terms such as ‘exposed and affected’, ‘exposed but unaffected’ and the term ‘affected’ was used interchangeably with ‘exposed’. In epidemiological studies, {{it is well known that}} not all subjects in an exposed area are affected. As early as 1987, a <b>dispersion</b> <b>model</b> was available which delineated the exposed areas but was never used.|$|E
