40|$|Abstract—Enterprise Architecture {{deals with}} the {{structure}} of an enterprise, relationships and interactions of its units. It provides a holistic approach to reconcile IT and <b>Business</b> <b>concerns</b> in an <b>enterprise.</b> Virtual Enterprises are collaborative ad-hoc alliances of multiple enterprises for a specific business opportunity. This paper looks into both the paradigms and Enterprise Architecture viewpoint of Virtual Enterprise. Service Oriented Architecture as a style of Enterprise Architecture proves to be an enabler of Virtual <b>Enterprises</b> at <b>Business</b> and Technology Levels.

40|$|The most {{thoroughly}} debated format {{issue in}} designing a {{cash flow statement}} for a <b>business</b> <b>enterprise</b> <b>concerns</b> use ofthe direct or indirectmethod when reporting cash from operating activities. The article argues that the reason why we cannot solve this dilemma of using the direct or indirect method is related to the fact that our discussion is limited to using the axiom of double-entry bookkeeping within commercial accounting. In this article, however, the discussion of whether to use the direct or indirect method is not limited to commercial double-entry bookkeeping; it is also based upon another accounting framework, specifically designed to deal with cash transactions of governmental organizations: single-entry cameral accounting. The article argues that commercial accounting could learn from cameral accounting, separating cash from non-cash balance sheet changes, and directly prepare {{a cash flow statement}} from the single-entries of the cash transactions on the cash account, before they are entered into the double-entry bookkeeping system, to provide a performance result (revenues minus expenses) and related balance sheet information (assets, liabilities and equity). By applying this procedure, the direct method of preparing a cash flow statement becomes the natural method to use. ...|$|R
