5|$|Agent Fox Mulder {{arrives at}} the civic center after {{what looks like a}} massacre; bodies lie on the {{sidewalk}} and in the foyer. Sheriff Spencer (John Cygan) explains that the suspect murdered four people from the elevator with his bare hands. His rampage ended when he was shot by a security guard. Spencer notes that seven other individuals have murdered twenty-two people in Franklin in the past six months. Mulder discovers that the LED display in the elevator has been damaged, and that the dead suspect has a green residue on <b>his</b> <b>fingertips.</b>|$|E
5|$|Infamous Second Son is an action-adventure game set {{in an open}} world {{environment}} and played from a third-person perspective. Players control the main character Delsin Rowe, who can parkour-style climb vertical surfaces like high-rise buildings. Delsin is a Conduit, which allows him to use superpower abilities by manipulating materials such as smoke, neon, video, and concrete. These materials can be weaponized (such that Delsin can perform melee attacks or fire projectiles from <b>his</b> <b>fingertips)</b> or used to deftly navigate the game world (such as using neon to dash up buildings). Using powers depletes a meter in the head-up display (HUD), which can be replenished by drawing from power sources such as smoke from exploded vehicles. Delsin earns new powers as he progresses through the story, which sees him fight against the Department of Unified Protection (D.U.P.) during missions. Each time Delsin gains a new power set he must destroy D.U.P. Core Relays to learn the basic abilities that correspond to it. Delsin upgrades and acquires new abilities by spending Blast Shards that have been collected, they are scattered throughout Seattle. Players become more powerful in combat by expanding Delsin's suite of abilities.|$|E

25|$|In the Eastern Conference Finals, a {{match up}} with the 61-win, Carlisle-led Pacers, the Pistons faltered in the final 90 seconds of Game 1, falling 78-74. Prior to Game 2, Rasheed Wallace famously {{guaranteed}} a Detroit victory. With Detroit clinging to a 69-67 lead with under 30 seconds to play, after Billups recovered the basketball after a Jermaine O'Neal blocked shot of Rasheed Wallace, Jamaal Tinsley stripped Billups and found Reggie Miller open down the court for {{what appeared to be}} the tying lay-up. As Miller approached the basket, Tayshaun Prince ran in from the left wing and blocked Miller's lay-up as it left <b>his</b> <b>fingertips.</b> Richard Hamilton recovered the loose ball before it went out of bounds and was fouled by Tinsley. Hamilton would make three free throws in the game's final 15 seconds to seal the victory and tie the series. The Pistons rode the momentum of Game 2 (including dominant wins in Games 3 and 5) to a 4-2 series victory, advancing to the NBA Finals for the first time in 14 years.|$|E

As Ochse points out, when Bemis becomes the last person on Earth, he finally has time to read, with all his books at <b>his</b> <b>fingertips</b> and the only impediment is technology when his medium for accessing them—his glasses—breaks. In a hypothetical world where all books are published electronically, Ochse observes, readers would be [...] "only a lightning strike, a faulty switch, a sleepy workman or a natural disaster away from becoming Henry Bemis {{at the end of the}} world"—that is, a power outage has the potential to give them time to read, yet like Bemis, they too would lose their medium for accessing their books—namely the computer.|$|E

[...] He scored touchdowns in each of the team's early season wins over Michigan State (55–0), Stanford (49-13), and Pitt (69-0). [...] His touchdown against Pitt came on defense, as he intercepted a pass and ran it back 37 yards. In the Big Nine opener against Northwestern, Elliott scored on a nine-yard run less than two minutes after the game started, as the Wolverines won, 49-21. [...] In Michigan's closest contest of the 1947 season, a 13-6 win over Minnesota, Elliott caught a 40-yard pass from Bob Chappuis on <b>his</b> <b>fingertips</b> at the Minnesota 15-yard line and went on to score with a minute and 15 seconds to go in the first half.

500|$|Walker is {{best remembered}} {{for a pair}} of one-handed catches he made in 2001. [...] Prior to the 2002 NFL Draft, Baltimore Ravens Senior vice {{president}} of football operations, Ozzie Newsome referred to Walker's collegiate catches as some of the best catches he has seen in college in a long time.

500|$|Rivera's {{signature}} pitch was a cut fastball or [...] "cutter", which exhibited {{lateral movement}} towards left-handed hitters {{similar to that}} of a slider but with the velocity of a fastball. The sharp, late movement of Rivera's cutter prevented hitters from making contact with the ball on the sweet spot of their bats, leading to them not only making weak contact on batted balls but also frequently breaking their bats; according to a tally by columnist Buster Olney, Rivera broke 44bats during the 2001 regular season. Chipper Jones, who once witnessed teammate Ryan Klesko break three bats in one plate appearance against Rivera in the 1999 World Series, called the pitch a [...] "buzz saw". Rivera's long fingers and loose wrist contributed to the pitch's movement, allowing him to impart more spin on the ball. Describing his grip of the cutter, he said, [...] "it's really a four-seam fastball with pressure on the middle finger". By adjusting the pressure that he applied to the ball with <b>his</b> <b>fingertips,</b> he could vary the pitch's movement. Rivera threw four-seam and two-seam fastballs as complementary pitches but primarily used his cutter; according to baseball statistics website Fangraphs, 83.3% of his pitches in 2010 were cutters. All three pitches typically reached a velocity in the low-to-mid 90smph.|$|E
