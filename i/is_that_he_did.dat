5|$|Having honed his {{personal}} style {{as a young}} man, and sticking broadly with {{it for the rest}} of his career, Massenet does not, as some other composers do, lend himself to classification into clearly defined early, middle and late periods. Moreover, his versatility means that there is no plot or locale that can be regarded as typical Massenet. Another respect in which he differed from many opera composers <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not work regularly with the same librettists: Grove lists more than thirty writers who provided him with librettos.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} change of command directly affecting the forts {{took place on}} October 17, 1861, when Brigadier General Thomas F. Drayton {{was assigned to the}} Third Military District of the Department of South Carolina, which meant that the forts were in his jurisdiction. Drayton, {{who was a member of}} a prominent Charleston family and a graduate of the United States Military Academy, remained in command through the actions of November 7. Whether he could have hastened the preparations of the forts for battle is debatable; the fact <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not.|$|E
500|$|What {{is known}} about Thored's time as ealdorman <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not have a good {{relationship}} with Oswald, Archbishop of York (97192). In a memorandum written by Oswald, a group of estates belonging to the archdiocese of York was listed, and Oswald noted that [...] "I held them all until Thored came to power; then was St Peter [...] robbed". One of the estates allegedly lost was Newbald, an estate given by King Edgar to a man named Gunnar, suggesting to historian Dorothy Whitelock that Thored may just have been reclaiming land [...] "wrongly alienated from his family".|$|E

500|$|Special effects {{producer}} Bill Millar acquired several cows, {{put them}} in a field, and photographed them for reference. Using digital technology he animated one of the cows to create the effect of it being sucked upwards. Finally, a [...] "cow puppet" [...] was dropped on a re-creation of Mulder's motel room at Fox Studios. Millar noticed that the cow puppet's color was different than his computer generated cow, forcing him to quickly change the color. Kim Manners later stated that his biggest regret with the episode <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not have David Duchovny respond [...] "Got milk?" [...] after the cow crashed through his roof.|$|E
500|$|However, {{there is}} an {{alternative}} reading possible, which may be closer to the facts of Traherne's experience as he expresses them in the quote above. [...] This <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not suffer a loss of faith, but rather identified his maturation away from a natural, innocent child's view of the world and his place in it, from an innate understanding of the wonder of God's creation, to a burdened grappling with the rules and expectation of church and society as an apostasy itself, which he had to overcome then by careful and disciplined study ("the highest reason"). [...] This childlike, accepting, and joyous view of faith and religious ecstasy {{is at the core of}} the writing from which the excerpt above is drawn, and is part of the reason for Traherne's appeal.|$|E
500|$|Two {{versions}} exist of how Tatsuguchi died. [...] One version <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{not participate}} in the attack. [...] Later in the day on May 30, two American soldiers, Charles W. Laird and John Hirn, who were searching for remaining Japanese forces following the defeat of Yamasaki's attack, approached the cave containing Tatsuguchi's field hospital. Tatsuguchi emerged from the cave, waving his Bible {{in the direction of the}} Americans and yelling in English, [...] "Don't shoot! [...] I am a Christian!" [...] Laird heard and understood what Tatsuguchi was saying and withheld fire. [...] Hirn, however, shot and killed Tatsuguchi. [...] Hirn later stated that he could not hear what Tatsuguchi was saying over the wind and noise of battle and that he thought that the Bible Tatsuguchi was holding was a weapon.|$|E

500|$|Although {{several people}} {{expressed}} {{the opinion that}} Mike Jeffrey had set Hendrix up {{in an effort to}} control him and create dependency, Shapiro and Glebbeek dispute this theory based on Jeffrey's severe risk of significant financial shortfall had Hendrix been convicted. Jeffrey's assistant, Trixie Sullivan, speculated that the drugs had been planted by a fan who became disgruntled after Hendrix refused his sexual advance. Both Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding later wrote in their autobiographies that the entire Hendrix entourage had been warned about a planned drug bust the day before flying to Toronto; both men also stated that they believed the incident had been set up and that the drugs had been planted in Hendrix's bag. According to author Ritchie Unterberger, although Hendrix [...] "took his fair share of drugs", the commonly accepted view <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not use heroin regularly and was not an addict; his drug use was typical of his peers, but not excessive. Mitchell wrote: [...] "Contrary to what some people have said, Jimi was never a junkie– that is he was never addicted to any drug, particularly heroin, which he tried once or twice but didn't like." ...|$|E
500|$|The idea {{of having}} Lisa fight the pterodactyl, named Myfanwy by the producers, made them laugh, and felt they had to include it. The line where Ianto calls Jack the [...] "biggest monster" [...] was {{intended}} to be cut out, but Chibnall decided to keep it because of its impact to the audience. The scene where the team lines up to execute Lisa towards the end was the first scene Chibnall had in mind for the episode, though in the first draft, it was Ianto who killed her. After the episode was written and filmed, Chibnall discovered two main plot holes in the story. The first <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not make clear that everything about Lisa, including the scene where she acted human was all part of her plan for her Cyberman-influence to take over, and reflected to adding at least two lines of dialogue to explain her motives clearly. The second was Jack having a cut lip in the end, even though he is immortal and all his wounds would have healed quickly. In the audio commentary for the episode, both Chibnall and actor Gareth David-Lloyd stated the reasoning behind the cut being there is because Jack's immortal powers would only deal with life-threatening wounds and not minor injuries.|$|E
500|$|Roper {{said that}} {{there were a couple of}} puzzles [...] "that seemed a little rough around the edges and whose {{otherwise}} straightforward solution suffered a bit from imperfect implementation." [...] He also criticized the difficulty of unlocking some of the bonus content, as some requirements are [...] "punishingly hard for most everyone." [...] Reed, however, said if players can find any flaws, they are based on [...] "personal taste", but also stated that regardless of refinement, [...] "you can never quite replicate the wow factor of the original—even if it ends up being a better game." [...] Navarro said that at times, the combat is [...] "overly straightforward ... and still prone to button mashing," [...] and said that it was [...] "a bit disappointing" [...] that more was not done to the combat system. He criticized the cliffhanger ending and said a few of the bonus challenges [...] "aren't all that great." [...] GameTrailers criticized the invisible walls, stating that [...] "There are places you should be able to go that you simply can't." [...] They also cited inconsistency issues in regards to navigation. Leone said his [...] "only real" [...] disappointment <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not feel the game was evolving the series.|$|E

2500|$|Max von Pettenkofer, in October 1892, drank bouillon {{deliberately}} {{infected with}} a large dose of cholera bacteria.

[...] Pettenkofer also took bicarbonate of soda to counter a claim by Koch that stomach acid killed the bacteria. [...] Pettenkofer escaped with mild symptoms and claimed success, but the modern view <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> indeed have cholera, luckily just a mild case, and possibly had some immunity from a previous episode.|$|E
2500|$|Blagojevich {{was often}} {{at odds with}} members of both parties in the state legislature. Democratic {{legislator}} Jack Franks said that the reason Blagojevich had problems passing laws {{with the cooperation of}} the General Assembly <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not spend enough time with the legislature. [...] "That’s a real reason he has such poor relations with the Legislature and can’t get any of his agenda passed, because he doesn’t talk to anybody." [...] When lawmakers working on a budget during a special session met at 10am rather than 2pm, and Blagojevich's attorney threatened that the Governor was considering legal action against the involved representatives, Democratic Rep. Joe Lyons told reporters, [...] "We have a madman. The man is insane." ...|$|E
2500|$|Today, Diophantine {{analysis}} {{is the area}} of study where integer (whole-number) solutions are sought for equations, and Diophantine equations are polynomial equations with integer coefficients to which only integer solutions are sought. It is usually rather difficult to tell whether a given Diophantine equation is solvable. Most {{of the problems in}} Arithmetica lead to quadratic equations. Diophantus looked at 3 different types of quadratic equations: , , and [...] The reason why there were three cases to Diophantus, while today we have only one case, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not have any notion for zero and he avoided negative coefficients by considering the given numbers , , [...] to all be positive {{in each of the three}} cases above. [...] Diophantus was always satisfied with a rational solution and did not require a whole number which means he accepted fractions as solutions to his problems. Diophantus considered negative or irrational square root solutions [...] "useless", [...] "meaningless", and even [...] "absurd". To give one specific example, he calls the equation [...] 'absurd' because it would lead to a negative value for [...] One solution was all he looked for in a quadratic equation. There is no evidence that suggests Diophantus even realized that there could be two solutions to a quadratic equation. He also considered simultaneous quadratic equations.|$|E
