Moreover, the possibility that the biogenesis of exonic miRNAs could destabilize the corresponding protein-coding transcript and reduce protein synthesis makes their characterization very intriguing and suggests a possible novel mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. This work was designed to carry out the computational identification of putative exonic miRNAs in 30 plant species and the analysis of possible mechanisms involved in their regulation. The results obtained represent a useful starting point for future studies on the complex networks involved in microRNA-mediated gene regulation in plants. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of growth cone (GC) and neurite retraction {{resulting from a}} rapid incrase in concentration of the trophic molecule NGF was studied. Neurite outgrowth from explants of 8 -d chick embryo dorsal root ganglia was achieved at very low NGF concentrations with heart conditioned medium during overnight culture. Quickly incrasing the NGF concentration in the growth medium dramatically affected GC and neurite morphology: the majority of GCs and neurites collapsed and retracted towards the cell body over a course of approximately 2 - 5 min. Retraction was elicited by increasing NGF levels from 0 to 0. 05 ng/ml to as little as 0. 5 ng/ml but did not occur if the NGF concentration during the initial overnight culture period exceeded 0. 8 ng/ml, regardless of how much the concentration was elevated. Similar concentration changes of cytochrome c or insulin <b>did</b> <b>nt</b> result in retraction. Neurites that had been separated from their cell bodies by cutting close to their exit from the explant still retracted when NGF levels were raised.

Stimulation of lipolytic activity in adipose tissue or inhibition of fat synthesis is one way to prevent these serious diseases.

Therefore, we evaluated the effect of the administration of lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus gasseri NT) on lipid metabolism and fat synthesis in a mouse high-fat-diet model, focusing on visceral fat. Balb/c mice were fed a 45 kcal % fat diet for 13 weeks with and without a freeze-dried preparation of L. gasseri NT (109 CFU/g).
