5|$|George Thomas Clark {{played an}} {{important}} role as an engineer on the project, reputedly taking the management of two divisions of the route including bridges over the River Thames at Lower Basildon and Moulsford and of Paddington Station. Involvement in major <b>earth-moving</b> works seems to have fed Clark's interest in geology and archaeology and he, anonymously, authored two guidebooks on the railway: one illustrated with lithographs by John Cooke Bourne; the other, a critique of Brunel's methods and the broad gauge.|$|E
5|$|Harper {{was appalled}} when Britain made India {{independent}} in 1947—he {{held that the}} British government had unnecessarily caved in to Indian nationalist demands and should have continued in the subcontinent indefinitely. He retained this view for years afterwards. He retired from the RAF in April 1949 with the rank of wing commander, and the same year emigrated to Southern Rhodesia, a British colony in southern Africa that had been self-governing since 1923. He settled in the central town of Gatooma, where he farmed, mined and set up an <b>earth-moving</b> contractor's business. In 1953, Southern Rhodesia became a territory of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland alongside Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Each territory retained its own political status and government, and Southern Rhodesia's constitutional status was unaltered.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1970s, studies {{indicated}} that active treatment {{would be the}} most suitable remedy for abandoned mine drainage in the watershed of Nanticoke Creek, with hydrated lime being proposed as one possible treatment method. However, some small scale passive treatment has been attempted in the watershed. A 2008 paper estimated that the Nanticoke Creek Assessment and Restoration Project would cost $5,000,000. An active treatment project by the Earth Conservancy began in 2012, with the intent to repair damage caused by the Askam Borehole. The Bureau of Abandoned Mine Reclamation of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection has a permit to discharge stormwater into the creek during <b>earth-moving</b> activities involving filling in dangerous strip pits.|$|E
5|$|Initially, it {{took more}} than 24hours for word of the level of devastation to reach {{officials}} in Manila as communications across Leyte were largely destroyed. By November7, search and rescue operations were underway across Leyte and Negros Occidental. The first shipment of relief supplies, consisting of food rations, rice, sardines, and used clothing, was to be shipped from Cebu later that day. On November8, Philippine President Corazon Aquino declared all of Leyte a disaster area. A Philippine Navy vessel set out with heavy <b>earth-moving</b> machinery and the Philippine Air Force deployed aircraft to assist in rescue efforts. Relief efforts in Ormoc City were hampered by a lack of clear roads and fuel. Amateur radio reports stated that an AC-130 was able to land at a local airport but materials had to be moved by helicopter from there since roads were blocked. Relief efforts were also hampered by continuing rains and the rough terrain of the affected region. By November11, approximately 8,300families had been rescued and another 7,521were evacuated from affected regions.|$|E
25|$|Much of the <b>earth-moving</b> {{equipment}} used is donated by corporations. The {{work on the}} monument has been primarily supported by visitor fees, {{with more than one}} million people visiting annually. The visitor center contains many pieces of rock blasted from the mountain; visitors may take samples in exchange for a small donation.|$|E
25|$|The Britannia Empress of Lima {{was on a}} {{scheduled}} flight from Honolulu Airport, Hawaii to Nadi Airport, Fiji. Shortly after take-off the crew had an engine fire warning, they feathered No. 1 engine and they jettisoned fuel before returning to Honolulu 40 minutes later. The three-engined approach appeared to be normal {{but at the last}} minute the crew decided to go-around and attempt another approach. The aircraft banked and veered to the left and the left wing tip hit the ground about 550 feet left from the center over the runway. The aircraft then disintegrated as it moved across the airfield before hitting some heavy <b>earth-moving</b> equipment. Apart from the rear fuselage and tail the aircraft was destroyed by fire, thirteen on board escaped but seven crew and 20 passengers were killed.|$|E
500|$|The trench was [...] wide, with brick {{retaining}} walls supporting an elliptical brick arch or iron girders spanning [...] The tunnels were wider at stations {{to accommodate the}} platforms. Most of the excavation work was carried out manually by navvies, although a primitive <b>earth-moving</b> conveyor {{was used to remove}} excavated spoil from the trench.|$|E
500|$|The {{railroad}} was reopened in 25 days by {{a construction}} force of one-thousand men and 175 pieces of <b>earth-moving</b> equipment including seven track gangs, nine bridge and building gangs, and personnel and equipment from Morrison-Knudsen. Four tunnels were quickly repaired, two more were daylighted by removing overburden to {{convert them to}} cuts, one was partially daylighted, and [...] of fill were placed to construct a [...] temporary alignment around the eighth tunnel while permanent repairs were underway.|$|E
500|$|Before {{and during}} construction, workers and {{engineers}} experienced problems. Contracts {{for companies to}} construct the {{various parts of the}} dam were difficult to award as few companies were sizable enough to fill them. This forced companies to consolidate. In addition, Native American graves had to be relocated and temporary fish ladders had to be constructed. During construction additional problems included landslides and the need to protect newly poured concrete from freezing. Construction on the downstream Grand Coulee Bridge began in [...] and more considerable <b>earth-moving</b> began in August. Excavation for the dam's foundation required the removal of [...] of dirt and stone. To reduce the amount of trucking required in the excavation, a conveyor belt nearly [...] long was built. To further secure the foundation, workers drilled [...] holes into the granite and filled any fissures with grout, creating a grout curtain. At times, excavated areas collapsed from overburden. In order to secure these areas from further movement and continue excavation, 3-inch (76mm) diameter pipes were inserted into the mass and chilled with cold liquid from a refrigeration plant. This froze the earth and secured it so construction could continue.|$|E
500|$|Johnson's Cut-off was {{the only}} trail {{that could be used}} year-round, but it still had problems, as it had been built without use of <b>earth-moving</b> equipment, and thus did not always take the optimal route. The state adopted a survey by Sherman Day in September 1855, but failed to make use of it. Two years later, the {{counties}} of Yolo, Sacramento, and El Dorado, all of which would be benefited by further improvements, began planning and carrying out work. The state legislature created a [...] "Board of Wagon Commissioners" [...] on March 8, 1858, and it completed the improvements {{by the end of that}} year. This new route had better grades than the old cutoff, deviating from it in several places: it followed the present Smith Flat Road rather than Carson Road east of Placerville, traversed Peavine Ridge much further down the slope, returning to the river west of Kyburz (roughly via the present White Meadows Road, Ice House Road, and Weber Mill Road to US 50 at Granite Springs Road), and crossed into Carson Valley via Luther Pass. By 1860, the immense traffic over the road and lack of maintenance had worsened it to the point that it could no longer be used by stagecoaches.|$|E
500|$|In 1958 James Shaw and {{a partner}} {{purchased}} a 25-ton International Harvester TD24 tractor that was formerly owned by Tasmania's Hydro Electric Commission. The company by this point was known as [...] "JAH Shaw & Sons". With {{the lack of a}} transporter at first the tractor could only be used in the close surrounds. One of its first jobs was levelling the tennis courts in Whitemore. By 1960 JAH Shaw & Sons had moved into large scale <b>earth-moving.</b> In 1970 they tendered for, and won, work on the Cressy to Longford irrigation scheme; [...] of main channel excavation and [...] of smaller channels. By the 1970s the company was known as [...] "Shaw Contracting". An offshoot was launched in 1973 as [...] "Shaw Mix" [...] which sold concrete and created and installed precast concrete panels. Shaw Mix were involved with the Launceston General Hospital and some cast concrete bridges but this line of work ceased during the 1990s. Other significant contracts have included: Building [...] of the Hume freeway from Seymour to Avenel Victoria in 1978; A road upgrade near Samoa's capital Apia in 2004; Constructing, from 2009, a [...] bypass of the Town of Dilston on the road from Launceston to Georgetown. The company completed their three-storey offices in the town in 1999. Alwyn ShawSon of James Shawand his wife Judy ran the business until 2013, when they sold it to a group that included long-term company employees. When sold the company had approximately 100 employees.|$|E

2500|$|The {{standard}} American military railway car was [...] {{wide and}} [...] long riding on two 4-wheel archbar bogies. 1,695 of these cars were {{built by the}} Magor Car Company, American Car and Foundry and Ralston Steel Car Company. Most were flatcars, but some had gondola sides, others had roofs (either with open sides or like conventional boxcars) and others carried shallow rectangular tanks with a capacity of [...] of drinking water. The boxcars and tank cars were regarded as top-heavy and prone to derailment; so most loads were carried on flatcars and gondolas. Approximately 1,600 4-wheel side dump cars were produced in several versions for construction <b>earth-moving.</b> The total number of cars shipped to Europe was 2,385.|$|E
2500|$|The segment to Bjerka Station {{opened on}} 21 February 1942. The section onward to Finneidfoss {{could not be}} opened due to a slide in a cutting north of Bjerka, caused by {{erroneous}} <b>earth-moving</b> techniques. To reach Mo i Rana a temporary segment was opened past Bjerka Tunnel, allowing the final part to Mo to open on 21 March. The station was far from finished. The missing [...] to connect to the Dunderland Line were quickly built, opening on 5 May. The poor condition of the track meant that travel time on the [...] from Mosjøen to Mo was three hours. Much of the work on this section had to be corrected and improved afterwards. An estimated 18 workers were killed on this segment alone.|$|E
2500|$|The {{high winds}} of the {{blizzard}} packed the snow so tightly and high, drifts reached [...] in places; normal snow removal equipment was ineffective, and <b>earth-moving</b> equipment, such as front-end loaders, {{had to be}} used. Colonel Daniel Ludwig of the USACE stated the [...] "snow was very densely packed and that snow plows would be virtually useless {{on most of the}} roads". NWS meteorologist Ben Kolker noted on one of the roads near the NWS forecast office, high lifts were used [...] "to dig away at it and break it up like big hunks of rock". In Depew, a suburb of Buffalo, volunteer firemen used a trenching machine to get people out of a house that had been drifted shut. The long cleanup period included the railroads, who used front-end loaders to clear snow from the rail yard into open-bodied rail cars and shipped it east by Conrail.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1966, Nido, {{approached}} Maj. Gen. Winston P. Wilson, Chief of the National Guard Bureau, {{inquired about}} the possibility of constructing a range at the Army Guard’s Salinas Training Area (Camp Santiago), located 35 miles on the south coast area of Puerto Rico. Two days later, Brig Gen. Salvador Roig approved a plan for this project and assigned Captain Gabriel I. Peñagarícano as project officer. The NGB budgeted $10,000 for this construction, this tight budget required a maximum in-house effort. The U.S. Army Antilles Command, caretakers of the Salinas Training Area, provided <b>earth-moving</b> equipment and personnel to level the target area. They also dug necessary holes for electric power poles, communications and strafing and skip-bombing targets. The range towers were donated by the air depot at McDill AFB and transported directly to the range on C-123 aircraft. Nido, who also served as commander of the local chapter of the [...] "Military Order of World Wars", retired from the military with the rank of Brigadier General in 1974.|$|E
2500|$|Expanding student numbers {{meant that}} more {{extensive}} premises {{closer to the}} city were required. A bequest by John Jones of land at Stanmore saw the College move to the newly fashionable inner-city suburbs. A grand stone edifice was designed by Thomas Rowe and {{has been described by}} architectural historian Morton Herman as 'an almost perfect example of scholastic Gothic Revival architecture'. <b>Earth-moving</b> work began on the site in 1876 and by May 1878 the building had reached first floor height. A public ceremony was held and six commemorative stones were laid. Amongst the six given the honour of laying the stones were Sir George Wigram Allen KCMG the [...] philanthropist who was Speaker of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. He had lent £12,000 for the new buildings at Stanmore and later endowed the Wigram Allen Scholarship for boys proceeding to matriculation. The formal opening of the new school building was by Sir George on 18 January 1881. By resolution of the College Council, the name Newington College was perpetuated on the new site. Seventy school and theological students migrated from Silverwater to Stanmore and Newington has remained there ever since.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{finished}} {{the course of}} alterations {{in the hands of}} John Carr, Lord Fitzwilliam turned in 1790 to the most prominent landscape gardener, Humphry Repton, for whom this was the season's most ambitious project, one that he would describe in detail while the memory was still fresh, in Some Observations of the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening (1803). A terrace centred on the main block effected a transition between the house and the rolling grazing land. Four obelisks stood on the bowling green, dwarfed by the scale of the house; Repton re-sited them. Though the parkland had accumulated numerous eye-catcheres and features (see below), Repton found there were few trees, the house being surrounded by [...] "coarse grass and boulders" [...] which Repton also removed, before the large-scale <b>earth-moving</b> operations began, effected by men with shovels and donkey-carts, to reshape the lumpy ground into smooth swells. Two large pools, visible from the East Front and the approach drive, were excavated into a serpentine shape. Some of Flitcroft's outbuildings were demolished, though not Carr's handsome stable court (1768), entered through a pedimented Tuscan arch. Many trees were planted.|$|E
