In 1929 he helped edit several chapters of Smith's Leading Cases (13th ed.) and in 1932 acted as a supervising editor for the 9th edition of Bullen & Leake's Precedents for Pleadings in the King's Bench Division. In 1932 he moved to his own set of chambers in Brick Court, and by 1936 he was earning over £3,000 a year. A notable case was L'Estrange v F Graucob Ltd [...] 2 KB 394, where he successfully argued an <b>exemption</b> <b>clause</b> was incorporated because a contract was signed. This was counter to his work as a judge, where he tried to minimise their impact, but he said that 'If you are an advocate you want your client to win.

40|$|<b>Exemption</b> <b>clauses</b> are {{commonly}} used in hospital contracts to exclude the liability of the hospital or hospital personnel for personal injury or death and presented to the patient on a take-it-or-leave-it-basis. Patients usually sign these contracts containing the <b>exemption</b> <b>clauses</b> because {{it is impossible to}} negotiate the terms of the contract. <b>Exemption</b> <b>clauses</b> that are not contrary to public policy are enforceable between parties. Courts have generally favoured the application of the principles of freedom of contract and pacta sunt servanda to determine the enforceability of <b>exemption</b> <b>clauses.</b> The Consumer Protection Act, 68 of 2008 (CPA) was recently enacted, and among other things, it addresses the unfairness that is associated with <b>exemption</b> <b>clauses</b> and aims to improve consumer awareness. The common law principles were modified by the CPA. <b>Exemption</b> <b>clauses,</b> after the enactment of the CPA, are only enforceable if it complies with the requirements as set out in the Act. <b>Exemption</b> <b>clauses</b> must be drafted in plain and understandable language especially clauses that can be construed to be unfair and the risks pertaining to these clauses must also be drafted in an understandable manner. Such a clause must be brought to the patient s attention and a consumer must sign next to the clause after any term that can be interpreted as unfair terms and risks that is associated with such term is explained to him. A drafter should take into consideration greylist and blacklist terms when drafting <b>exemption</b> <b>clauses,</b> since certain clauses are prohibited and other terms are presumed to be unfair. A drafter can include a term that excludes liability for personal injury of the patient, but the hospital or its personnel will have to prove that such term is fair under the circumstances. A clause that excludes liability for death is not permissible. The enactment of the CPA was long overdue and it was vital, especially in respect of fairness of <b>exemption</b> <b>clauses</b> and the protection of patients against unfair contract terms.

40|$|<b>Exemption</b> <b>clauses</b> are a rule {{rather than}} an {{exception}} particularly in standard-form contracts. Consumers are usually forced to accept such terms on a "take-it-or-leave-it" basis. This state of affairs shows that freedom of contract is theoretical and could lead to injustices.

40|$|One of {{the reasons}} why the Consumer Protection Act 68 of 2008 (CPA) was enacted, was to protect {{consumers}} against suppliers who enforced onerous terms and conditions to the disadvantage of the consumer. <b>Exemption</b> <b>clauses</b> are amongst such onerous terms and conditions and according to Part G of the CPA (sections 48 - 52), <b>exemption</b> <b>clauses</b> must not be drafted on terms that are unjust, unfair and unreasonable. As almost all consumer agreements are drafted unilaterally in the form of standard-form contracts, this research will focus on the history of standard-form contracts and exemption clauses; {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} using them, landmark cases in which <b>exemption</b> <b>clauses</b> in standard-form contracts were dealt with, the effect of <b>exemption</b> <b>clauses</b> in standard-form contracts in light of the CPA and the legal remedies that are available to the consumer in instances where the supplier does not comply with the provisions of the CPA.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{discusses the}} continued existence and enforceability of <b>exemption</b> <b>clauses</b> {{within the framework of}} the subsequent movement towards consumer protection. It is argued that the provisions of the Act will lead to the consequence that unfair <b>exemption</b> <b>clauses</b> will be phased out because it could be declared void in terms of this Act and consequently its use will become impractical. Although <b>exemption</b> <b>clauses</b> can be viewed as an essential part of most contracts, such clauses are regarded as one of the most contentious clauses in practice, because they usually exclude the liability of the supplier for losses resulting from defective performance. This Act will lead to a shift away from the strict rule of freedom of contract towards a position of consumer awareness and fair contracting. The Act further provides consumers with the right to, inter alia, good quality goods and services and guarantees these rights by prescribing and controlling the liability of the suppliers. As a result, liability due to defective goods and services may no longer be exempted through <b>exemption</b> <b>clauses.</b> Disputes regarding the fairness of such clauses must further also be considered in view of the guidelines set out in the Act. This study however welcomes the enactment of the Act and believes that it could benefit the country as a whole. Dissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011. Mercantile Lawunrestricte...|$|R

40|$|The {{current state}} of the law {{relating}} to <b>exemption</b> <b>clauses</b> has been described, fittingly, as "unmanageably complex„ 1. These complexities, in part, have stemmed from the past failure of the courts to recognise that examption clauses {{are an integral part of}} a contract and should not be ignored in assessing the rights and duties of the parties to the agreement. This thesis has two functions. One is to examine the role and function of <b>exemption</b> <b>clauses</b> in contracts and the choice of controls which can be imposed upon such clauses. The second function is to assess the desirability of reform of the terms implied, chiefly by the Sale of Goods Acts and the Trade Practices Act, in contracts. Since <b>exemption</b> <b>clauses</b> often exclude, restrict or modify implied terms discussion of these terms has been drawn into the body of the thesis.

40|$|Consumerism {{loaded with}} paternalistic ideals of {{protecting}} customers is {{by all means}} a paradigm shift from the so-called freedom of contract ideology. The aim of consumerism is to regulate and intervene in the market in their noble cause of upholding and empowering consumers in trade. Nevertheless {{in the area of}} exclusion of trader’s liability in consumer contracts, the move towards upholding consumer rights has been very minimal. Absence of appropriate legal mechanism {{in the form of a}} specific legislation to curb the use of unfair terms in consumer contracts has lead to oppression of consumers and the spread of unethical conduct of traders. In Malaysia however, the legal development in the area of <b>exemption</b> <b>clauses</b> in consumer contracts appears to be minimal. In the area of exemption of liability in Malaysia, by virtue of section 3 and 5 of the Civil Law Act 1956, the common law principles have been applied. However the case law development in Malaysia on exemption of liability, especially when the parties are of unequal bargaining power, causes a serious concern in consumer protection.
