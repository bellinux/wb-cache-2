40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This study identifies the characteristics of seven key principles of good/corporate governance at three levels: as notions that originated in business; in their applications to sport through systematic review; and {{in relation to the}} interpretations given to them in the Olympic Movement. The aims of this study are, thus, to establish and utilise the <b>IOC</b> <b>s</b> definitions/interpretations and operationalisations of corporate and/or good governance developed in a western framework and apply to a non-western NOC, the Korean Olympic Committee (KOC). This study adopts critical realist assumptions which give rise to the hypothesis that both the regularities of the Korean society and its unobservable social structures {{have an impact on the}} corporate governance of the KOC. It also uses Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) to examine each interviewee s discourse in order to identify the knowledge embraced by it and to interpret social practice(s) and the exercise of power. CDA is employed in relation to four selected events follows: the KOC/KSC merger, budgetary planning, the recruitment of staff in terms of gender and disability equity and the processes used for selecting the KOC President and the Chef de Mission. The unobservable deep structure is shown to be real domain in Korean society by the social practices exhibited in the four events. The government and, in particular, the State President represent the highest and most influential authority in decision-making on Korean sports policy. That power relationship coupled with the pre-existing structure of the KOC/KSC s financial dependency on the government has resulted in a situation where the government has been able to interfere greatly in the KOC/KSC s overall decision-making on sports policy including the election of the President of the KOC. The KOC/KSC President is the most influential stakeholder in the decision-making within the organisation including the selection of Chef de Mission. As the pre-existing structure of cultural expectations determines that women should usually quit their jobs after marriage and that people with disabilities are incapable of working, the strongly male with abilities-dominated organisational culture has resulted in a social phenomenon whereby few females or people with impairments have succeeded in being promoted to senior positions. From the macro-level perspective, the first KOC/KSC merger accomplished on the orders of the State President shows the dominance of economic power as suggested in Marxist influenced forms of analysis. The incumbent KOC President, who is at the pinnacle of the business elite, contributed to the KOC/KSC merger, which illustrates the aspect of elitism. In connection with the budgetary process, this may be viewed as evidence of the existence of a neo-corporatist structure in which the state plays a central role and acts in a unitary way with the involvement of a limited number of actors. With respect to the meso-level perspective, the aspect of clientelism is exhibited since the government habitually appoints its political aides to be the heads of various sporting organisations. Concerning political governance, it becomes obvious that the government has direct control over KOC/KSC s policy. In terms of systemic governance, the relations among the domestic stakeholders of the KOC are more likely to follow a hierarchical type of governance, as the government has adopted the highest position and the National Federations are under the control of the KOC/KSC. With reference to Lukes (1974) second dimension of power this can be evidenced in the context of the non-decision making roles of women and the disabled. The <b>IOC</b> <b>s</b> interpretations of the key principles of corporate governance in a western framework are applied to the KOC. Accountability, responsibility, transparency and democracy are established but the KOC s governance practices are not equivalent, while effectiveness and efficiency are interpreted as the same ways of the <b>IOC</b> <b>s.</b> In general, power centralisation is apparent throughout the Korean cultural context. The KOC s power structure and organisational culture is likely to be concentrated to the KOC President within the organisation and broadly, the Korean government enjoys its power centralisation decision-making in the Korean context which gives rise to a peculiarly Korean way of interpreting and applying the principles of corporate governance. In such circumstances, nevertheless, where the KOC is making an effort to align its practices with the <b>IOC</b> <b>s</b> recommendations as much as possible, the indication is that the KOC is on course to reflect the <b>IOC</b> <b>s</b> governance practices...|$|R

40|$|Institutional {{accreditation}} {{in higher}} education presents a dual reality: Accreditation is intended to hold colleges and universities accountable through external evaluation and, at the same time, accreditation constitutes an opportunity for higher education leaders to assess, improve, and communicate {{the quality of their}} undertakings. In an increasingly global field of higher education, quality practices become diffused across national boundaries. U. <b>S.</b> institutional <b>accreditation</b> is one of the quality practices embraced around the world; institutions of higher education, particularly in the Global South, aspire to obtain U. <b>S.</b> institutional <b>accreditation.</b> While important, this phenomenon has gone largely unexamined in research. This study follows an ethnographic case study approach to explore in-depth how a Mexican institution of higher education engaged in the process of institutional accreditation with a U. S. regional accrediting agency. ^ One Mexican university located only a few miles away from the U. S. -Mexico border was selected as the site for conducting this case study. The university obtained initial institutional accreditation in 2012, which presented a valuable opportunity for conducting the study. After analyzing line by line nearly 500 pages of documents and conducting thirteen interviews with faculty and administrators from the university, this project presents findings organized around four major themes: (a) Reputational value is a central motivation to pursue U. <b>S.</b> <b>accreditation</b> given that, through accreditation, the institution in Mexico becomes connected to internationally recognized universities; (b) while desirable from many perspectives, the accreditation process triggers a set of intra-organizational dynamics and stressors, chief among them is a complex division of labor in which faculty members are necessary yet distanced from decision making; (c) compliance with highly challenging [...] yet perceived as fair [...] standards legitimizes both accreditation process and the U. S. accreditors that are perceived as reluctant players in a process mainly intended to assist emergent systems of higher education; and (d) language and translation are significant concepts to understand the accreditation process as they also establish power relations in which proximity and similarity to the U. S. grants power to the candidate institution. ^ Based on the empirical findings, different interpretations of U. <b>S.</b> institutional <b>accreditation</b> are discussed along with the implications of the study for policy, practice, and further research. ...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY This {{document}} describes {{guidelines for}} accreditation of Sleep Medicine Centres in Europe. These guidelines {{are the result}} of a consensus procedure, in which represent-atives of the European Sleep Research Society (ESRS) and representatives of different European National Sleep Societies (ENSS) were involved. The information obtained during different rounds of consultation was gathered and processed by the members of the Steering Committee of the ESRS. The scope of the guidelines is to define the characteristics of multidisciplinary Sleep Medicine Centres (SMCs), in terms of requirements regarding staff, operational procedures and logistic facilities. Accredita-tion of SMCs is proposed to be the responsibility of the individual ENSS. The Accreditation Guidelines may thus be considered an instrument for the national societies to develop new or standardize existing accreditation questionnaires, as well as procedures for visiting the site, drafting the accreditation report, and finally, granting the accreditation. The Accreditation Guidelines are meant to be a line of action, that ideally should be followed as close as possible, but that may be subject to certain exceptions, depending on local customs or regulations. k e yword <b>s</b> <b>accreditation,</b> europe, guidelines, sleep medicin...|$|R

40|$|WILLIAMSBURG [...] Dean William B. Spong Jr. of the Marshall-Wythe School of Law denied Tuesday {{allegations}} of collusion between the American Bar Association and the College of William and Mary {{in the college}} 2 ̆ 7 s quest for a 5 million law school building. He was addressing the State Council of Higher Education, which recommended that Richard Bland College develop a two-year program for gifted students. When the 1976 General Assembly clipped all but a token appropriation from the state budget, the ABA insisted that the law school 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>accreditation</b> was endangered until the new facility was completed. Soon after, some lawmakers and others were muttering that the college ha somehow encouraged the ABA to raise the issue {{as part of the}} college 2 ̆ 7 s campaign to squeeze building money from the legislature. Instead of the 5 million-plus that the college says is required, the assembly empowered Gov. Mills E. Godwin Jr. to make available a token sum to begin, and ground-breaking took place Sept. 11. The law school 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>accreditation</b> 2 ̆ 2 remains in grave jeopardy, 2 ̆ 2 in part because Godwin 2 ̆ 7 s demand for a 5 per cent cut in state spending 2 ̆ 2 has created very serious problems for the law library, 2 ̆ 2 college President Thomas A. Graves Jr. said at a session here of the State Council of Higher Education. When the ABA agreed last spring to continuing accreditation, it was on the basis of promises of a stated level of continuing financial support. Those promises 2 ̆ 2 are no longer accurate, 2 ̆ 2 Graves said. He added that 2 ̆ 2 it is of critical importance that we receive the full funding by the 1977 General Assembly. 2 ̆ 2 He did not suggest where the legislature might find the 55 million, plus other millions already requested for other capital projects. Spong, a former senator, said he 2 ̆ 2 sensed an attitude... that there has been some collusion between the College of William and Mary and the American Bar Association to force the building of a new law school here at Williamsburg. 2 ̆ 2 As president of the Virginia Bar Association, he has spent 18 months 2 ̆ 2 looking into it [collusion charges], and I am absolutely convinced that that is not the case, 2 ̆ 2 Spong said. Two lawyers on the state council, H. Merrill Pasco of Richmond and George M. Warren Jr. of Bristol, voiced sympathy for the Spong position. After the U. S. Supreme Court a few years ago refused to allow Richard Bland College to become a four-year college on ground that that would hinder desegregation of the tax-supported college system, a study was launched to make recommendations {{on the future of the}} two-year affiliate of the College of William and Mary.

This case study addressed the unfulfilled demand for the American MBA in Luxembourg, the viability of a part-time MBA program in the English language, the status of higher education in the new European Union, the efforts of a small university to obtain endorsement in a foreign country, {{and the development of a}} model for other colleges and universities which might consider such a program. The case study methodology was employed to analyze the creation and implementation of this program through the examination of survey results, governmental documents, European Union publications, and discussions with government, business and community executives. The questionnaire designed for input from the first 49 students in the program identified a higher number of women students than might be expected in the European culture, a predominance of engineering and financial backgrounds, a desire for management, human resource and entrepreneurial skills and a need for personal growth. Although increased income was an expectation, it was one of the least important factors in seeking admission. Such factors as better skills, career opportunities, self-improvement and future marketability were judged more critical by students. Additional findings included: 1) there was a need for advanced management education (MBA) in English in select foreign countries; 2) foreign governments in these select countries were willing to assist in the implementation of such programs; 3) agreements to progress with development of higher education programs could be verbal and needed not to involve written legal documents; 4) non-American businesses did support their employees seeking the advanced management education through tuition reimbursement; 5) the extension of a part-time advanced management program (MBA) from an American University, for working university degreed professionals was viable in central Europe. Among the conclusions were the following: 1) there was a distinct sequence of decisions relating to the University and the foreign country; 2) the director of the program must have complete authority and autonomy for an identifiable period; 3) the costs of the program must be shared by a foreign country and tuition income; 4) excess revenues must be reinvested In the foreign country; 5) admission standards must be strictly adhered to in accordance with the University's U. <b>S.</b> <b>accreditation</b> requirements.

40|$|Patient {{survival}} post {{liver transplant}} (LT) {{is important to}} both {{the patient and the}} center 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>accreditation,</b> but over the years physicians have noticed that distant patients struggle with post LT care. I hypothesized that patient 2 ̆ 7 s distance from the transplant center had a detrimental effect on post LT survival. I suspected Hepatitis C (HCV) and Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) patients would deteriorate due to their recurrent disease and {{there is a need for}} close monitoring post LT. From the current literature it was not clear if patients 2 ̆ 7 distance from a transplant center affects outcomes post LT. Firozvi et al. (Firozvi AA, 2008) reported no difference in outcomes of LT recipients living 3 hours away or less. This study aimed to examine outcomes of LT recipients based on distance from a transplant center. I hypothesized that the effect of distance from a LT center was detrimental after adjusting for HCV and HCC status. Methods: This was a retrospective single center study of LT recipients transplanted between 1996 and 2012. 821 LT recipients were identified who qualified for inclusion in the study. Survival analysis was performed using standard methods as well as a newly developed Monte Carlo (MC) approach for change point detection. My new methodology, allowed for detection of both a change point in distance and a time by maximizing the two parameter score function (M 2 p) over a two dimensional grid of distance and time values. Extensive simulations using both standard distributions and data resembling the LT data structure were used to prove the functionality of the model. Results: Five year survival was 0. 736 with a standard error of 0. 018. Using Cox PH it was demonstrated that patients living beyond 180 miles had a hazard ratio (HR) of 2. 68 (p-value 3 ̆c 0. 004) compared to those within 180 miles from the transplant center. I was able to confirm these results using KM and HCV/HCC adjusted AFT, while HCV and HCC adjusted LR confirmed the distance effect at 180 miles (p= 0. 0246), one year post LT. The new statistic that has been labeled M 2 p allows for simultaneous dichotomization of distance in conjunction with the identification of a change point in the hazard function. It performed much better than the previously available statistics in the standard simulations. The best model for the data was found to be extension 3 which dichotomizes the distance Z, replacing it by I(Z 3 ̆ec), and then estimates the change point c and tau. Conclusions: Distance had a detrimental effect and this effect was observed at 180 miles from the transplant center. Patients living beyond 180 miles from the transplant center had 2. 68 times the death rate compared to those living within the 180 mile radius. Recipients with HCV fared the worst with the distance effect being more pronounced (HR of 3. 72 vs. 2. 68). Extensive simulations using different parameter values in both standard simulations and simulations resembling LT data, proved that these new approaches work for dichotomizing a continuous variable and finding a point beyond which there is an incremental effect from this variable.

Among publicly supported law schools, the university 2 ̆ 7 s ranked number three, behind only the University of Michigan and the University of California, Berkeley. But elating though it is, the high standing of the University of Virginia law school dramatizes the deplorable plight of the state 2 ̆ 7 s other publicly-supported law school at the College of William and Mary. While the Charlottesville institution basks in scholarly praise, the Williamsburg law school is in danger of losing its accreditation. This should not be. On the contrary, the William and Mary law school should be one of the most eminent in the nation, for it is the oldest in the nation. It was founded in 1779 at the suggestion of Thomas Jefferson, then governor of Virginia, and the distinguished George Wythe was its first professor. Chief Justice John Marshall was one of Wythe 2 ̆ 7 s earliest students. Through the years, the William and Mary law school often has had to struggle to stay alive; and it is in trouble now because of grossly inadequate physical facilities. Unless William and Mary soon receives money to construct a new law school building, funds that the state has promised but never provided, the American Bar Association may withdraw the school 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>accreditation.</b> The need for a new building has been clearly demonstrated. During the last three years, approximately 2, 100 persons have applied for admission to the William and Mary law school, but it has been able to accommodate only 450, at least 70 per cent of them Virginians. Even for this number, present facilities are inadequate and fail to meet ABA standards. And this is the most important point. After all, it would be unrealistic and even undesirable for any law school to attempt to provide space for every single applicant. Gov. Mills E. Godwin Jr., the State Council of Higher Education and General Assembly all have recognized William and Mary 2 ̆ 7 s need. The legislature has appropriated 500, 000 to finance utility and site work for a new building, and it has conditionally appropriated 5 million for the building itself. But because of the state 2 ̆ 7 s revenue problems, this money is not now available and the project is in peril. The General Assembly should do its utmost in the current session to provide these funds. Of course the state has other pressing capital needs, and the legislature cannot finance all of them at this time. But the William and Mary law school should stand at the very top of the priority list. This institution, whose able new dean is former Sen. William B. Spong Jr., has the history and the leadership to become one of the nation 2 ̆ 7 s greatest law schools. But unless the General Assembly enables it to retain its accreditation, it may soon cease to be rated even an acceptable law school. And that, in our opinion, would be an educational tragedy...|$|R
40|$|In August of 2009, {{policies}} and procedures to verify the sex of female athletes were called into question when South African runner Caster Semenyawon the 800 meter event of the World Championships in Berlin. Responding to rumors of gender fraud, and fueled by Semenya’s speed, musculature, and deep voice, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) requested that Semenya submit to sex verification to confirm her eligibility for the women’s division. This Article discusses the International Olympic Committee 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> (<b>IOC)</b> policy on sex testing, the myth of sex-verification testing, and {{the myth of the}} level playing field. It concludes with a proposal prohibiting sex verification testing. The Author recognizes that sex-verification and the level playing field are illusory goals, and in so doing avoids many of the problems that result from the IOC’s current policy of suspicion-based sex-verification testing. As Caster Semenya’s case shows, the policy is rife with abuse and selective application. Moreover, considering the myth of the level playing field created by numerous personal advantages that all athletes bring to the starting line, sex-verification testing inflicts harm on the athlete’s dignity, privacy and personal life that are far disproportionate to any unfairness that is being targeted by examining sex...|$|R
40|$|Using a multiple-case, {{inductive}} {{study of}} eight technology collaborations between ten {{organizations in the}} global computing and communications industries between 2001 and 2006 this paper examines why some interorganizational relationships produce technological innovations while others do not. Comparisons of more and less innovative collaborations show that high-performing collaborative innovation involves more than possessing the appropriate structural antecedents (e. g., R&D capabilities, social embeddedness) suggested by prior alliance studies. Rather, it also involves dynamic organizational processes associated with collaboration partners’ leadership roles that solve critical innovation problems related to recombination across boundaries. While dominating and consensus leadership processes are associated with less innovation, a rotating leadership process is associated with more innovation. It involves alternating decision control that accesses the complementary capabilities of both partner organizations, zig-zagging objectives that engender deep and broad technological search for potential innovations, and fluctuating network cascades that mobilize different participants who bring variable inputs to recombination. The paper also discusses recombination mechanisms {{in the organization of}} collaborative innovation, variations in the performance of dynamic interorganizational ties, and how organizations develop symbiotic relationships that overcome the tendency of long-lived relationships toward inertia.

Let X denote a locally connected continuum such that X is rim-metric and such that X contains no nondegenerate metric subcontinuum. Is X rim-finite {{and therefore the}} continuous image of a compact ordered space? Herein we study this question. In so doing, we obtain analogues of a classical result of Whyburn. In [9] Treybig showed that if a continuum X is the continuous image of a compact ordered space and X contains no non-degenerate metric subcontinuum, each pair of points is separated in X by some finite set of points. In problem 5 of [1] the authors raised the following related problem. Let X denote a locally connected continuum such that X is rim-metric and such that X contains no nondegenerate metric subcontinuum. Is X rim-finite and thus the continuous image of an arc? We recall the following necessary definitions. A continuum is a compact connected Hausdorff space. A space X {{is said to be}} an IOK if there exists a compact ordered space K and a continuous onto map f: K → X; in case K is connected, X is said to be an <b>IOC.</b> A space <b>S</b> is rim-P if and only if S admits a basis of open sets each of whose boundaries has property P...|$|R

40|$|ABET is {{the preeminent}} {{organization}} in the U. <b>S.</b> for <b>accreditation</b> of 2 - and 4 -yr college-level educational programs in applied science, computing, engineering, and technology. ABET accreditation regimes require program outcomes assessment. The Technology Accreditation Commission (TAC) of ABET is charged with accrediting two- and four-yr Engineering Technology (ET) programs. The 4 -year ET major at the University of Delaware is a general ET program; and, {{for the purposes of}} TAC of ABET accreditation, must demonstrate its graduates have mastered the a through k program outcomes listed in TAC of ABET documentation for Criterion 3 of its General Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Technology Programs. The a through k program outcomes, which include such statements as: a. an appropriate mastery of the knowledge, techniques, skills and modern tools of their disciplines, and b. an ability to apply creativity in the design of systems, components or processes appropriate to program objectives, are notoriously difficult to assess because they require complex blends of interdependent skills, the evaluations of which may be influenced by considerable subjectivity. Iowa State University (ISU) 3 has adopted a competency-based assessment approach to demonstrate program outcomes for Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC) of ABET 2 accreditation of all its engineering programs in addition to its programs in agricultural systems technology and industrial technology. The ISU technology programs are accredited by the Association of Technology, Management, and Applied Engineering 4. In consultation with graduates and industry partners, ISU developed a set of 14 “workplace competencies. ” Each competency was designed to be “clear, concise and independent of all others” 3. Each competency is demonstrated by a “set of observable and measurable key actions. ” The confounding that plagues assessment of the ABET a-k program outcomes is avoided, and a measure of objectivity is introduced. The ISU competencies were determined to be “necessary and sufficient to address the EAC of ABET a-k outcomes” 3, and a matrix mapping the ISU workplace competencies to the EAC of ABET a-k outcomes was developed. This paper describes the adaptation of ISU’s competency-based assessment approach for outcomes assessment and TAC of ABET accreditation of the University of Delaware’s ET program. University of Delaware student competencies, derived from the ISU student competencies, are mapped to the TAC of ABET a-k program outcomes. As with ISU’s approach, a student ePortfolio system is utilized. Evaluations of competencies are informed by the student’s performance in a “Discovery Learning Experience”—either a technical practicum in industry or an undergraduate research project...|$|R
40|$|In 2008, the Section on Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar of the American Bar Association {{commenced}} {{a comprehensive}} review of the accreditation standards for American legal education. By July of 2011, most of the revised standards and rules of procedure had been drafted, discussed and approved by the section 2 ̆ 7 s Standards Review Committee (2 ̆ 2 SRC 2 ̆ 2) and were ready for submission to the council. However, the SRC 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> revised <b>accreditation</b> policies were not submitted for action by the council until 2014, more than six years after the review process began, as a result of decisions made by section leaders. The revised standards were particularly noteworthy for addressing several of the most significant accreditation issues facing legal education and higher education nationally, including: the need for greater focus on student learning outcomes and assessment of student learning; the utility of a common admission examination; a greater focus on educating for lawyering skills and competencies; and a sufficiently ambitious minimum bar success rate applicable to all law schools. In nearly all respects the review was both comprehensive and successful. However, {{at the end of the}} lengthy process, the council was unable to approve a few highly important provisions. Those provisions, referred to as policies pertaining to 2 ̆ 2 terms and conditions of faculty employment 2 ̆ 2 (T 2 ̆ 6 CE) and protection of academic freedom, are the subject of this article. The article provides a look at the history of the efforts undertaken during the comprehensive review to revise and improve the accreditation policies concerning T 2 ̆ 6 CE and faculty academic freedom and describes why, at the conclusion of the comprehensive review, the council failed to address them. In particular, the article describes the constituencies consulted and the factors considered by the SRC in drafting revised T 2 ̆ 6 CE standards and how the proposed revisions addressed complex issues concerning rights, duties, and status of all law faculty. The article contends that the council failed its leadership responsibilities by refusing to make a decision among several options that it had requested when confronted by competing interest-group preferences. The article concludes with some encouragement to the council to take the leadership initiative and address the perplexing, and likely to be enduring, difficulties of the T 2 ̆ 6 CE policies, given the likelihood that, in the future, the current standards will need to be amended to resolve their ambiguities...|$|R
40|$|Background: There is {{a paucity}} of {{published}} literature regarding the correlation between faculty characteristics and outcomes on the National Physical Therapy Examination for Physical Therapist Assistants (NPTE-PTA). Purpose:To determine {{if there was a}} relationship between faculty characteristics in PTA educational programs and program outcomes on the NPTE-PTA. Subjects: The 233 Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy Education (CAPTE) PTA programs accredited in 2006. Method:A retrospective, quantitative, non-experimental, correlational design. Data were from 190 / 233 of the PTA programs from dataset of CAPTE 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> PTA annual <b>accreditation</b> report (AAR) and the Federation of State Boards of Physical Therapy 2 ̆ 7 s (FSBPT) pass rate database. Selected faculty traits (designation of terminal degree, years of teaching experience, employment status, license designation [physical therapist or physical therapist assistant] and clinical specialization) were correlated to program pass rates. ResultsSeven factors had a statistically significant relationship to the outcomes on the NPTE-PTA at the 0. 05 alpha level: a) the number of full-time faculty (r s = -. 169); b) the number of adjunct faculty with an associate degree (r s =. 200); c) the number of full-time faculty with a terminal degree (r s = -. 175); d) the number of core faculty with a terminal degree (r s = -. 158); e) the number of all faculty with a terminal degree (r s = -. 152); f) the number of years of teaching experience of the full-time faculty (r s = 159); g) the number of years of teaching experience of the core faculty (r s =. 143). Backward deletion regression analyses demonstrated an overall model of two combined predictor factors (full-time faculty years of teaching and full-time faculty terminal degree) that significantly predicted the first time pass rate on the NPTE-PTA accounting for 6. 5...|$|R
40|$|There is {{currently}} no evidence describing what characteristics make an Athletic Training Program Director (PD) an effective leader. An influx of accredited programs {{resulted in a}} rapid increase in the demand for PDs, yet training and preparation for these positions has failed to evolve. Although Certified Athletic Trainers (ATs) are trained in specific content areas, they {{may not always be}} prepared for the administrative and leadership responsibilities associated with the role of PD (Leone, 2008). This dissertation examined the relationships between selected characteristics and leadership outcomes of Athletic Training Program Directors. ^ Each PD participants (n= 27) completed a demographic questionnaire to obtain the leader 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> academic preparation, <b>accreditation</b> experience and leadership training history. Each participant also completed the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) to obtain leadership styles, behaviors, and outcomes. Overall, the PDs reported utilizing transformational leadership most often and passive avoidant leadership least often. There {{was no significant difference between}} PDs with master 2 ̆ 7 s and doctorate degrees on overall leadership outcome. However, participants with a doctorate degree scored significantly different on the effectiveness component of the leadership outcome compared with participants with a master 2 ̆ 7 s degree. Those participants who have completed academic coursework on leadership scored significantly different on the leadership outcome compared to those who have not completed academic coursework on leadership. ^ Findings from this study indicate that changes to the current requirements for the role of PD may be warranted. Consideration should be given to increasing the minimum degree requirement and requiring academic coursework on leadership. Future research may be useful in determining specific degree guidelines and types and amounts of leadership training that would be beneficial to Athletic Training PDs. ...|$|R
