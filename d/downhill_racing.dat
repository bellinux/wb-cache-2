2500|$|Mountain bike {{disc brakes}} may range from simple, {{mechanical}} (cable) systems, to expensive and powerful, multi-piston hydraulic disc systems, commonly used on <b>downhill</b> <b>racing</b> bikes. Improved technology {{has seen the}} creation of vented rotors for use on mountain bikes, similar to those on cars, introduced to help avoid heat fade on fast alpine descents. Although less common, discs are also used on road bicycles for all-weather cycling with predictable braking, although drums are sometimes preferred as harder to damage in crowded parking, where discs are sometimes bent. Most bicycle brake discs are made of steel. Stainless steel is preferred due to its anti-rust properties. Discs are thin, often about 2mm. Some use a two-piece floating disc style, others use a floating caliper, others use pads that float in the caliper, and some use one moving pad that makes the caliper slide on its mounts, pulling the other pad {{into contact with the}} disc. Because the [...] "motor" [...] is small, an uncommon feature of bicycle brakes is that the pads retract to eliminate residual drag when the brake is released. In contrast, most other brakes drag the pads lightly when released so as to minimise initial operational travel.|$|E
