On 29 April 2008, CAAS signed its then biggest single security contract for all airport related security services by engaging Certis CISCO to provide security services at Singapore Changi Airport, as well as Seletar Airport, Changi Airfreight Centre, and the Singapore Air Traffic Control Centre. It involves the deployment of about 2,600 Certis Cisco personnel, including armed Auxiliary Police Officers and unarmed aviation security officers to perform tasks such as screening checked baggage, controlling access to restricted areas, and screening passengers before they board their aircraft.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the primary}} {{responsibilities}} of government in a state is the maintenance of law and order. <b>Security</b> <b>of</b> lives and property of the populace {{is one of the}} visible manifestations of good governance. This paper examined the public perception of good governance in the provision <b>of</b> <b>security</b> in Anambra state. The cross sectional survey design was adopted using the multi stage sampling technique for selection of study participants. 900 participants were drawn from the three major cities in Anambra state. Collated data were analyzed using frequency counts and percentages. However, relationships between variables were determined by the application of inferential statistics (chi square and regression analysis). It was found in the study that corruption, lack <b>of</b> <b>security,</b> maladministration and incompetence are the problems working against good governance in Anambra state. The study also found that the security situation in the state can be improved by entrenching good governance, provision of employment opportunities, provision of necessary infrastructure, having purposeful and visionary leadership and by empowering the youths through skill acquisition programmes. Furthermore, good governance as a predictor <b>of</b> <b>security</b> was also found to be significant at p=. 033. The study therefore recommended among others that leaders should be accountable, transparent, selfless and patriotic in the <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> their duties...|$|R

The thesis concerns all the phases of the process <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> the debt, from the proposal of permission <b>of</b> the <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> the debt until its accomplishment. The thesis focuses on relevant legal regulation and case law. I also present the institute <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> debt of husband and wife which is quite often used without any legal support. The thesis is divided into five chapters. The Chapter One deals with the proposal of permission <b>of</b> the <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> the debt. It examines particularly the subjects who are authorized to submit it and possible decisions of the court including the reasons for its dismissal. In the next Chapter I investigate two possible ways <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> the debt, the liquidation of the debtor's assets and monthly payment of a specific amount. For each type the affected assets and advantages and drawbacks for the debtor are described. The possibility for creditors to vote about type <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> the debt is also discussed. The Chapter Three relates to the decision <b>of</b> approval <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> the debt which has specific essentials and effects and means a lot of duties for the [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Mathematical {{simulation}} {{and laboratory}} experiments {{were conducted to}} investigate the controlling factor for aerobic sludge granulation. A model was {{used to describe the}} biomass dynamics during the granulation process. The simulation results indicate that the selective <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> small and loose sludge flocs is the key controlling factor for granulation. In the experimental studies, tests were conducted with four batch column reactors (BCR) that were seeded with both activated sludge flocs and mature granules. Three different sludge discharge methods were tested, including unselective <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> mixed sludge, selective <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> small and slow-settling flocs, and selective <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> settled dense sludge. The results show that mixed sludge <b>discharge</b> and <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> dense sludge resulted in disappearance of granules from the reactors. Only selective <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> small and slow-settling sludge flocs led to complete granulation. Small and loose sludge flocs were found to have a clear advantage over large and dense granules in substrate uptake. It can be concluded that selective <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> loose flocs removes these competitors in suspended-growth mode from the reactors and makes the substrate more available for uptake and utilization by the biomass in attached-growth form, leading to granulation. © IWA Publishing 2010. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
