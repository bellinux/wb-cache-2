Joan Foggin and John Wilson were the first paid staff, while Eleanor Fisher, already working in the library became the first full-time staff member in 1952. She remained the in-charge librarian until her retirement nineteen years later. By 1955 there was a part-time library assistant as well; and soon a fulltime junior was being considered. Growth in library use and opening hours continued, so that by 1968 there were 3 fulltimers and a part-timer to help on Friday nights.Staffing peaked in 1986 with 11.5 <b>full</b> <b>time</b> <b>equivalents,</b> and was subsequently reduced to 8.67.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{describe}} the {{recruitment and retention}} of general practitioners and changes in their time commitment from 1 October 1990 to 1 October 1994. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of yearly data. SETTING: England and Wales. SUBJECTS: General practitioners in unrestricted practice. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Numbers of general practitioners moving {{into and out of}} general practice; proportion of general practitioners practising less than full time; proportion of general practitioners having unchanged time commitment over the study period; and proportion of general practitioners leaving general practice in 1991 who were subsequently practising in 1994. RESULTS: Numbers of general practitioners entering general practice (1565 in 1990, 1400 in 1994) fell over the study period as did the numbers leaving general practice (1488 in 1990, 1115 in 1994). The net effect was an increase in both the total and full time equivalent general practitioners practising from 1 October 1990 (26, 757 <b>full</b> <b>time</b> <b>equivalents)</b> to 1 October 1994 (27, 063 <b>full</b> <b>time</b> <b>equivalents).</b> Numbers of general practitioners practising full time were decreasing whereas part time practice was increasing; women were more likely to practise part time. 35. 5 % (43 / 121) of women practising full time and 17. 8 % (24 / 135) of men practising full time who left practice in 1991 were practising again in 1994. CONCLUSION: Simply using total numbers of general practitioners or net increase to describe workforce trends masks much movement in and out of general practice and between differing time commitments. Recruitment and retention issues need to be separated if reasonable policies are to be developed to assure the necessary general practitioner workforce for a primary care led NHS...|$|E

This information may then be used to formulate new environmental and economic policy measures. The aim of this paper is to define, describe and quantify the value of the marine sector in Ireland.

In this paper we evaluate this reform based on a structural labor supply model with unitary households which has been estimated on the European Statistics on Income and Living Conditions cross-sections 2004 – 2008.

The 1989 study was repeated by the East Anglian reporting system in 1992 to investigate changes in practice nurse workload. METHOD. Nurses in 22 practices recorded all the procedures they performed and their duration, over a two week period. RESULTS. The number of practice nurses in each practice had increased from 0. 7 <b>full</b> <b>time</b> <b>equivalents</b> in 1989 to 1. 2 in 1992.

Changes have taken place in the volume and range of work undertaken by practice nurses. There is potential for practice nurses to use the results both for negotiation and for education...|$|E
