High-net-worth individuals (HNWIs), small-business owners and families who desire the assistance of a credentialed financial advisory specialist call upon wealth managers to coordinate retail banking, estate planning, legal resources, tax professionals and investment management. Wealth managers can have backgrounds as independent Chartered Financial Consultants, Certified <b>Financial</b> <b>Planners</b> or Chartered Financial Analysts (in the United States), Chartered Strategic Wealth Professionals (in Canada), Chartered <b>Financial</b> <b>Planners</b> (in the UK), or any credentialed (such as MBA) professional money managers who work to enhance the income, growth and tax-favored treatment of long-term investors.|$|E
25|$|Finally, a newer {{method for}} {{determining}} the adequacy of a retirement plan is Monte Carlo simulation.

25|$|Now, most {{pension plans}} {{have the same}} {{protection}} as an ERISA anti-alienation clause giving these pensions the same protection as a spendthrift trust. The only remaining unprotected areas are the SIMPLE IRA and the SEP IRA. The SEP IRA is functionally similar to a self-settle trust, and a sound policy reason would exist to not shield SEP IRAs, but many <b>financial</b> <b>planners</b> argue that a rollover (or direct transfer) from a SEP IRA to a rollover IRA would give those funds protected status, too.|$|E

500|$|The Great Southern Group relied {{significantly}} on <b>financial</b> <b>planners</b> {{and accountants}} recommending their MIS products to investors. The company was paying commissions of ten percent – high by industry standards, and {{similar to those}} paid by other failed investment businesses including Westpoint Corporation and Storm Financial. It was also {{spending a lot of}} money on recruiting financial advisers to sell its products. One report indicated that A$137 million was spent on [...] "commissions, marketing and promotion in two years to 2008". Some accountants, with Great Southern's support, were recommending the agribusiness investment schemes, though they did not have a financial services licence; one report suggested over half of Great Southern's MIS sales were coming through accountants, often tax specialists from small practices. These practices had been questioned for several years by the corporate regulator ASIC and some market analysts, and were widely criticised following Great Southern's collapse. Some experts were critical of the lack of knowledge and expertise of the investment advisers recommending agroforestry MIS schemes.|$|E

[...] "We made Dark Side and it looked as if we'd cracked it," [...] recalled Waters. [...] "Then suddenly these bastards had stolen it all. It looked as if we might be faced with huge tax bills for the money that had been lost. Eighty-three per cent {{was a lot of money}} in those days and we didn't have it." [...] Pink Floyd terminated their relationship with NWG, demanding the return of uninvested funds. [...] "By force of necessity, I had to become closely involved in the business side," [...] recalled Gilmour, [...] "because no one around us has shown themselves sufficiently capable or honest to cope with it, and I saw with Norton Warburg that the shit was heading inexorably towards the fan. They weren't the first crooks we stupidly allied ourselves with. Ever since then, there's not a penny that I haven't signed for. I sign every cheque and examine everything." ...|$|E

2500|$|In October 2008 former CBA {{financial}} planner Jeff Morris alleged to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and subsequently a Senate Inquiry, {{the extent of}} the misconduct of CBA's financial planning arm, Commonwealth Financial Planning Limited (CFPL), {{but it was not until}} 16 months later that ASIC would launch an investigation. [...] "There was forgery and dishonest concealment of material facts," [...] the Senate Inquiry found in its report. They concluded a Royal Commission or Judicial Inquiry as it was deemed ASIC lacked the investigative powers required to uncover the full extent of the allegations. A week following the Senate Inquiry, CEO Ian Narev publicly apologised while announcing a compensation scheme. Former CEO Ralph Norris also conceded that he was aware of problems within CFPL acknowledging the presence of rogue <b>financial</b> <b>planners</b> but rejected the assertion of a conspiracy to cover it up. CBA has been criticised in the Senate for appointing Dr. Brendan French, who was the General Manager of Group Customer Relations before, as the head of the Open Advice Review program. The CBA defended Dr. Brendan French successfully in a defamation lawsuit in 2015; the decision was a single judge decision and was not appealed. Criticism has also been leveled at the fact that Dr. Brendan French was formerly a member of the board of directors of the Financial Ombudsman Service and is now working in CBA with respect to customer complaints.|$|E
