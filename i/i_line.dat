5|$|The network {{expanded}} rapidly {{during the}} early decades of the 20th century; by 1944 its main routes were completed, with the addition of its newest line occurring as late as 2007. The pace of expansion fell sharply after the Second World War. In the late 1990s expansion resumed at a quicker pace, and four new lines were planned for the network. Despite this, the network's expansion has been largely exceeded by the transportation needs of the city and is said to be overcrowded. As of 2015, two modernisation plans have been presented: City of Buenos Aires law 670, proposing the creation of 3 new lines, F, G and I; and the PETERS plan, wherein 2 lines are created and the <b>I</b> <b>line</b> is postponed for future expansion, plus several other route amendments.|$|E

It participated in the German efforts to suppress the Warsaw Uprising in August—September 1944.|$|E

2500|$|By March 1858, the Inverness and Aberdeen Junction Railway (I) {{had reached}} Elgin and {{completed}} its junction with GNoSR at Keith on 18 August. The Morayshire Railway completed the 3½ miles of track from Orton station to Rothes and opened to passenger traffic on 23 August 1858—this allowed the Morayshire Railway to resurrect {{its plans to}} build a railway between Rothes and Craigellachie and this section was completed on 23 December 1858. It terminated, however, on {{the west bank of the}} River Spey so as not to incur the expense of a bridge.The Morayshire company would, under its agreement with the I, work its own trains on the Elgin [...] Orton section but without permission to stop for passengers. The engines used by the Morayshire Railway were small and prone to breakdown and unsuitable for the steeper gradients on this section of track—their use lasted only six weeks. The I blamed the Morayshire for causing delays in its own schedules and insisted on the Morayshire coaches being attached to its own and taken to Orton—relations between the two companies deteriorated rapidly and a dispute over charging for line use ensued. Matters came to a head when I held back the Morayshire Railway goods until the I goods were ready to be forwarded either to or from Orton. This caused difficulties with onward transmission of goods from and to Lossiemouth Harbour. Seemingly deliberate schemes were being devised to obstruct the Morayshire coaches from entering onto the <b>I</b> <b>line.</b> The two companies came to an agreement and the Morayshire Railway announced to its long suffering passengers that agreement had been reached and that delays should no longer happen.|$|E

40|$|We present high {{spectral}} resolution (R ≈ 108, 000) Stokes V polarimetry {{of the classical}} T Tauri stars (CTTSs) GQ Lup and TW Hya obtained with the polarimetric upgrade to the HARPS spectrometer on the ESO 3. 6 m telescope. We present data on both photospheric lines and emission lines, concentrating our discussion on the polarization properties of the He <b>i</b> emission <b>lines</b> at 5876 Å and 6678 Å. The He <b>i</b> <b>lines</b> in these CTTSs contain both narrow emission cores, believed to come from near the accretion shock region on these stars, and broad emission components which may come from either a wind or the large-scale magnetospheric accretion flow. We detect strong polarization in the narrow component of the two He <b>i</b> emission <b>lines</b> in both stars. We observe a maximum implied field strength of 6. 05 ± 0. 24 kG in the 5876 Å line of GQ Lup, making it the star with the highest field strength measured in this line for a CTTS. We find field strengths in the two He <b>i</b> <b>lines</b> {{that are consistent with}} each other, in contrast to what has been reported in the literature on at least one star. We do not detect any polarization in the broad component of the He <b>i</b> <b>lines</b> on these stars, strengthening the conclusion that they form over a substantially different volume relative to the formation region of the narrow component of the He <b>i</b> <b>lines...</b>|$|R
