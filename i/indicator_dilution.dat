Environmental removal processes were extensively investigated under laboratory {{conditions in the}} past but there is still a lack of information on how organic micropollutants attenuate on the catchment scale. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe the chemical and toxicological profile of a 4 th order river and to characterize in-stream processes. We propose indicator chemicals and indicator in vitro bioassays as screening methods to evaluate micropollutant input and transport and transformation processes of the chemical burden in a river. Carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole were selected as <b>indicators</b> for <b>dilution</b> processes and the moderately degradable chemicals tramadol and sotalol as indicators for potential in-stream attenuation processes. The battery of bioassays covers seven environmentally relevant modes of action, namely estrogenicity, glucocorticogenic activity, androgenicity progestagenic activity and oxidative stress response, as well as activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, using the GeneBLAzer test battery and the AhR-CALUX and AREc 32 assays.|$|R

It is able to report Total Blood Volume (TBV), Plasma Volume (PV) and Red Cell Volume (RCV) using the <b>indicator</b> <b>dilution</b> principle, microhematocrit centrifugation and the Ideal Height and Weight Method. The indicator or tracer, is an I-131 albumin injection. An equal amount of the tracer is injected into a known and unknown volume. Clinically, the unknown volume is the patient’s blood volume, with the tracer having been injected into the patient’s blood stream and tagged to the blood plasma. Once the tracer is injected a technician takes five blood samples which undergo microhematocrit centrifugation to extrapolate true blood volume at time 0. The concentration of the I-131 in the blood is determined from the blood radioactivity against the standard, which has a known I-131 dilution in a known volume. The unknown volume is inversely proportional to the concentration of the indicator in the known volume; the larger the unknown volume, the lower the tracer concentration, thus the unknown volume can be calculated. The microhematocrit data along with the I-131 indicator data provide a normalized hematocrit number, more accurate than hematocrit or peripheral hematocrit measurements. Measurements are taken 5 times in 6 minute intervals so that the BVA-100 can calculate the albumin transudation time to understand the flux of liquid through capillary membranes.|$|E

The development of stable ultrasound contrast agents allows new applications of the <b>indicator</b> <b>dilution</b> method. Ultrasound contrast agent dilutions permit an echographic noninvasive measurement of cardiac output, ejection fraction, and blood volumes.

40|$|The {{generally}} accepted hypothesis on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hydrodynamics suggests that CSF is actively formed mainly by choroid plexuses, circulates unidirectionally along the brain ventricles and subarachnoid space, and is passively absorbed mainly into the dural venous sinuses. CSF formation rate (Vf) {{has been extensively}} studied by the ventriculo-cisternal perfusion technique, the results {{of which have been}} used as the key evidence for confirmation of this hypothesis. This method and the equation for the calculation of Vf have been established {{on the basis of the}} assumption that the <b>dilution</b> of the <b>indicator</b> substance is a consequence of a newly formed CSF, ie, that a higher CSF formation rate will result in a higher degree of <b>dilution</b> of the <b>indicator</b> substance. However, it has been experimentally shown that the <b>indicator</b> substance <b>dilution</b> inside the CSF system does not occur because of a “newly formed” CSF, but it is a consequence of a number of other factors (departure of substances into the surrounding tissue, passing around the collecting cannula into the cortical and spinal subarachnoid space, departure into the contralateral ventricle, etc). Using this technique it is possible to “calculate” the CSF formation even in dead animals, in an in vitro model, and in any other part of the CSF system outside the ventricles that is being perfused. Therefore, this method is indirect and any <b>dilution</b> of the <b>indicator</b> substance in the perfusate caused by other reasons would result in questionable and often contradictory conclusions regarding CSF formation rates...|$|R

40|$|Peritoneal dialysate volume {{determined}} by <b>indicator</b> <b>dilution</b> measurements. Dialysate volume was simultaneously {{determined by}} two different <b>indicator</b> <b>dilution</b> techniques {{as a function}} of dwell time in a rabbit model of peritoneal dialysis using isotonic, hypertonic and hypotonic solutions. After a single injection of a large molecular weight index solute (SIIS) to the dialysis solution at a known concentration, the first <b>indicator</b> <b>dilution</b> technique determined dialysate volume by the change in the index solute concentration. In the second technique, dialysate volume was determined after multiple injections of a different index solute (MIIS) by measuring the change in concentration of the index solute two minutes after its injection into the dialysis solution. The volumes determined by SIIS were similar during isotonic, but larger during both hypertonic and hypotonic exchanges, than those determined by MIIS. Drained volume was dependent upon the peritoneal catheter used, was not different from that determined by MIIS, but was significantly smaller than that determined by SIIS. The present results suggest that systematic errors in volume measurements when using <b>indicator</b> <b>dilution</b> result from the loss of the index solute from the peritoneal cavity and are greater for SIIS than for MIIS. A model for fluid transfer during peritoneal dialysis showed that dialysate volumes determined by SIIS were useful, however, when estimating the rate of fluid movement across the peritoneal membrane...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{transport}} and radioecology of the therapeutical radioisotope 131 I {{has been studied}} in Canberra, Australia. The isotope has been detected in water samples and its activity quantified via characteristic J-ray photo peaks. A comparison of measurements on samples from upstream and downstream of the Canberra {{waste water treatment plant}} shows that 131 I is discharged from the plant outflow into the local Molonglo river. This is consistent with observations in other urban environments. A time-correlation between the measured activities in the outflow and the therapeutical treatment cycle at the hospital identifies the medical treatment as the source of the isotope. Enhanced activity levels of 131 I have been measured for fish samples. This may permit conclusions on 131 I uptake by the biosphere. Due to the well-defined and intermittent input of 131 I into the sewage, the Canberra situation is ideally suited for radioecological studies. Furthermore, the 131 I activity may be applied in tracer studies of sewage transport to and through the treatment plant and as an <b>indicator</b> of outflow <b>dilution</b> following discharge to the environment. ...|$|R
40|$|Validation of {{a revised}} slow-stop flow {{recirculation}} method. Technical Note. Slow flow/stop flow methods {{have replaced the}} three needle technique as methods of choice for measuring recirculation. However, the time delay after reducing blood flow may affect the BUN in the systemic (slow flow/stop flow arterial line) sample and therefore limit the accuracy of this methodology. It has been observed that recirculation does not occur in a properly cannulated access unless the access blood flow rate {{is less than the}} dialyzer blood flow rate (BFR). This suggests that the systemic sample could be obtained at a higher than usual blood pump rate. We studied 50 patients and compared a revised slow-stop flow (S/SF) recirculation technique in which the systemic sample was drawn after the blood pump rate was reduced to 120 ml/min for 10 seconds and then stopped, to a non-urea based method that utilized <b>indicator</b> velocity <b>dilution</b> (IVDM). Seven patients were found to have recirculation by IVDM; all had recirculation by S/SF of more than 10 % (minimum 16. 7 %) and an access BFR that was less than the dialyzer BFR. In the 43 patients without recirculation by IVDM, the mean recirculation by S/SF was 1. 9 ± 3. 2 % (mean ± SD). Five patients without recirculation by IVDM had more than 5 % recirculation by S/SF (range, 5. 9 to 8. 3 %). Although there was a small systematic tendency to overestimate recirculation, this modified urea based method was still able to detect recirculation with good reliability. Single values above 10 % are highly likely to indicate the presence of true recirculation. Repeated values over 5 % are also likely to be significant, indicating the presence of true recirculation and its clinical correlate, marginal access blood flow...|$|R

In response we have compared the H 2 S test's ability to detect and quantify faecal contamination in an aquifer impacted by septic tank leachfields with measurements obtained concurrently using conventional bacterial indicators, coliphages, faecal sterol biomarkers, Cryptosporidium and Giardia. Like these other analytes, H 2 S testing detected a contamination gradient ranging from high (septic liquid) to moderate (exfiltration zones), to background (e. g. domestic bores), corresponding to <b>indicator</b> removal + <b>dilution</b> by factors > 106. Presence/absence tests could not distinguish between heavily and slightly contaminated waters, whereas multi-tube testing (e. g. 10 10 mL arrays) did.

40|$|The {{injection}} of indicators {{in the blood}} stream is used for several diagnostic measure ments of the cardiovascular system functionality. An indicator is a non-toxic substance that can be detected by a specific sensor. The detection often implies a contact between indicator and sensor. As a result, the measurement is invasive, i. e. a catheter must be inserted through the {{blood vessels in the}} measurement site. The invasiveness issue can be overcome by means of contrast imaging techniques. Contrast agents are substances that enhance the signal detected by specific imaging modalities. The measurement of the contrast (or indicator) concentration versus time results in an <b>indicator</b> <b>dilution</b> curve. Several hemodynamic models can be adopted for the curve interpretation and for the estimation of the cardiovascular parameters of interest. This chapter provides an overview on the <b>indicator</b> <b>dilution</b> theory and the clinical techniques that can be adopted for the measurement of dilution curves. Both invasive and minimally invasive techniques are discussed. Particular attention is dedicated to the use of medical imaging techniques such as ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging.

40|$|While theorists differ sharply on the {{expected}} {{economic impact of}} stock options, typically empirical work has found a positive association between option schemes and firm productivity. However, existing data are limited and may not enable reliable investigation of the productivity effects {{of different types of}} option scheme. New panel data for all Finnish publicly listed firms during 1992 - 2002 enable us to distinguish plans that are broad based and others limited to particular employees and address issues of endogeneity concerning inputs and options. Diverse specifications are estimated including dynamic panel data models with a GMM estimator. For broad-based option scheme indicators the key result is that different estimators consistently find statistically insignificant associations with firm productivity. For selective option schemes, the baseline fixed effects estimator suggests a 2. 1 - 2. 4 % positive and statistically significant effect of a <b>dilution</b> <b>indicator</b> on firm productivity. However, in empirical models in which endogeneity and dynamics are taken into account, no evidence is found of a link with firm productivity. Thus our findings are consistent with hypotheses that predict negligible effects of option plans for enterprise performance, such as those based on free riding, or psychological expectancy theory or accounting myopia. However, by finding weak evidence for productivity effects of targeted schemes (and none for broad-based plans) our findings tend not to support hypotheses based on managerial rent seeking. personnel economics, stock options, productivity, panel data...|$|R

Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured by Fick methodology using N(2) O as the <b>dilution</b> <b>indicator</b> gas.

To investigate variability in invertebrate faunal communities and numbers with depth, 3 flowing fissures were selected in each borehole – one near the water table, one {{near the bottom of the}} borehole and one in the middle. A double packer system was used to isolate each of these fissures, enabling them to be directly sampled. At each interval, invertebrates were collected from 5000 litres of pumped water. Previous net hauling from above the bottom of boreholes and borehole CCTV images indicated that stygobiotic invertebrates live in the water column (particularly on the borehole walls) at substantial depths above the bottom. Fauna from the isolated packer intervals therefore comprise both animals living in the borehole water column within the isolated interval and those living within the water pumped from the aquifer. The 5000 litres of pumped water was divided into 13 samples in which fauna were collected separately to investigate how numbers and types of invertebrates relate to the amount of water that has already been pumped from the interval.

40|$|Ethyl glucuronide (EtG) and ethyl sulfate (EtS) are direct alcohol {{consumption}} markers widely used nowadays for clinical and forensic applications. They are detectable {{in blood and}} urine even after consumption of trace amounts of ethanol and for a longer time frame, being detectable even when no more ethanol is present. The instability of EtG against bacterial degradation in contaminated urine samples and/or the possible postcollection synthesis of this metabolite in samples containing, e. g., Escherichia coli and ethanol, may cause false identification of alcohol uptake. Therefore, it {{is of paramount importance}} to constrict these error sources by inhibition of any bacterial growth causing hydrolization or synthesis of EtG. This study evaluates a new method of collecting urine samples on filter paper, dried urine spots (DUS), for simultaneous detection of EtG, EtS and creatinine, having the great advantage of inhibiting bacterial activity. In addition, a method validation for the determination of EtG and EtS in DUS was performed according to the FDA guidelines. Sterile-filtered urine was spiked with EtG and EtS, inoculated with E. coli and incubated. Liquid and dried urine samples were collected after various time intervals up to 96 h. Liquid samples were frozen immediately after collection, whereas aliquots for DUS were pipetted onto filter paper, allowed to dry and stored at RT until analysis 1 week after. The specimens were analyzed by LC-ESI-MS/MS. As expected, degradation of EtG, but not of EtS, was observed in contaminated liquid urine samples. However, the specimens collected on filter paper and stored at RT showed no degradation during storage. Therefore, collecting urine samples on filter paper for EtG and EtS analysis {{turns out to be a}} reliable method to avoid bacterial degradation of EtG and EtS, and consequently, stabilization of these ethanol metabolites is achieved.

40|$|MD (Res) There is {{evidence}} to suggest that therapy targeted at normalising extravascular lung water volume (EVLW) can improve outcomes from critical illness. Indocyanine green-thermal double <b>indicator</b> <b>dilution</b> (ICG-thermal) is considered the clinical reference standard of EVLW volume measurement but is no longer commercially available. The accuracy and reliability of the only clinically available technology (single-thermal <b>indicator</b> <b>dilution)</b> has been questioned in several studies. This thesis incorporates two clinical studies and one laboratory study designed to assess the measurement of EVLW and intrathoracic blood volumes using a prototype lithium-thermal double <b>indicator</b> <b>dilution</b> technique. The proof of concept study suggested our hypothesis that intrathoracic blood volume (ITBV), which is required for the calculation of EVLW volume, could be determined using lithium <b>indicator</b> <b>dilution,</b> was valid. Peri-operative trends and absolute values of ITBV were consistent with those obtained using ICG-thermal in a similar patient study group. The median absolute value of ITBV measured at baseline using indocyanine green (1417 [Â± 208] ml) was similar to that obtained using lithium <b>indicator</b> <b>dilution</b> 1542 (Â± 601) ml. EVLW volume measured by three <b>indicator</b> <b>dilution</b> techniques was then compared to postmortem gravimetry in porcine models of acute lung injury. Sepsis and acute lung injury were associated with increased EVLW volume, (9. 2 [Â± 3. 0] ml kg- 1), compared to sham operated animals (6. 6 [Â± 0. 45] ml kg- 1) in keeping with previous studies. The Li-thermal (Bias- 1. 8 [Â± 13. 1] ml kg- 1) and ICG-thermal (Bias- 1. 0 [Â± 6. 6] ml kg- 1) techniques demonstrated acceptable accuracy, but wide limits of agreement suggested poor reliability. 4 The single-thermal technique systematically over-estimated EVLW, with unacceptably wide limits of agreement (Bias + 8. 5 [Â± 14. 5] ml kg- 1). In this laboratory investigation, the double indicator methods appeared more reliable than the single-thermal technique. However none could be considered ideal. Results of the final clinical study suggested EVLW volume measurement in man with the Li-thermal method was clearly erroneous (Bias - 7. 6 [Â± 7. 4] ml kg- 1) and compared poorly to simultaneous measurements made using the ICG-thermal method (Bias + 13. 2 [Â± 14. 4] ml kg- 1). A considerable over-estimation of mean transit time (MTT) when compared to the ICG-thermal technique (Bias 12. 8 [Â± 13] sec) was observed, a likely consequence of using an external lithium ion electrode instead of an intra-arterial catheter. Manual analysis of the dilution curves suggested considerable variability when compared to the automated analysis. The poor accuracy of MTT, and consequently ITBV measurements in the clinical study, may partly be due to software analysis of the lithium dilution curves. Thoracic blood volumes derived from measurement of ICG transit time are reliable. However, EVLW calculations based on the thermal indicator transit time are likely to be inaccurate. The findings of these clinical and laboratory investigations demonstrate poor agreement between both the prototype Li-thermal and the single thermal measurements of EVLW volume and the ICG-thermal method. Trans-pulmonary lithium <b>indicator</b> <b>dilution</b> measurements of ITBV and EVLW volume using an external lithium ion electrode are not sufficiently accurate to safely guide clinical interventions in individual patients. Consequently we decided not to further develop the lithium-thermal technique of EVLW volume measurement...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} blood-tissue {{exchange}} by the multiple <b>indicator</b> <b>dilution</b> technique often needs frequent sampling {{in the blood}} of the <b>indicator</b> <b>dilution</b> curves (IDC). Usually, this requires the use of a catheter supported by a pump. This causes a distortion in the IDC, which must be removed for proper interpretation of the data. A deconvolution-based methodology to remove IDC distortion is presented. First, the catheter impulse response is modelled by means of data obtained from a suitable experiment. Then the reconstruction of the blood IDC is tackled by a new nonparametric deconvolution algorithm, which provides (quasi) time-continuous signals and exploits statistically based criteria for the choice of the regularisation parameter. The methodology is applied to the removal of cathether distortion in studies of glucose blood-tissue exchange in the human forearm and myocardium...|$|E

This paper presents a method for blood flow measurements based on UCA dilution. Dilution curves are determined by real-time densitometric analysis of the video output of an ultrasound scanner and are automatically fitted by the Local Density Random Walk model. A new fitting algorithm based on multiple linear regression is developed. Calibration, that is, the relation between videodensity and UCA concentration, is modelled by in vitro experimentation. The flow measurement system is validated by in vitro perfusion of SonoVue contrast agent. The results show an accurate dilution curve fit and flow estimation with determination coefficient larger than 0.95 and 0.99, respectively.|$|E
40|$|A {{model for}} {{interpretation}} of extravascular <b>indicator</b> <b>dilution</b> experiments is proposed, {{in which the}} indicator is assumed to enter the blood-tissue ex-change region through vascular sources, to equilibrate instantaneously and local-ly between blood and tissue at the capillary-cell level, and, while maintaining this local equilibration, to be transported to vascular sinks by simultaneous diffusion and convection at a more macroscopic distance level. The model has the mathematical form of the time-dependent Fick diffusion equation to which a convection term was added. The model contains as opposite limiting cases the washout-type models and a recently proposed delayed wave model of the <b>indicator</b> <b>dilution</b> process. The various features of the extravascular indicator outflow pattern—appearance time, modal time, semi-log downslope, and dispersion about the mean—are {{described in terms of}} two parameters: (1) a diffusion parameter, square of source-to-sink distance divided by diffusion coefficient of the indicator in the tissue; (2) a convection parameter, the blood flow divided by steady-state solubility volume of distribution of the indicator in the tissue. In contrast to the preceding opposite limiting cases, the present model accounts plausibly for extravascular indicator experiments in dog kidney.

40|$|<b>Indicator</b> <b>dilution</b> outflow {{patterns}} in renal venous blood from anesthetized dog kidney were measured for the monohydric alcohols from methanol to hexanol with tritiated water (THO) and T- 1824 dye as reference indicators. Also measured were olive-oil-to-water and red-cell-to-plasma partition coefficients. The <b>indicator</b> <b>dilution</b> results were: (1) at normal hematocrit, the mean transit times {{of all the}} alcohols were approximately {{the same as for}} THO; (2) at low hematocrit, the mean transit time of hexanol was approximately 1. 6 times that of THO; (3) at both normal and low hematocrits, the upslope portion of the alcohol curves was earlier and steeper than that of the THO curve, the more so with increasing alcohol carbon number. Results 1 and 2 and the partition coefficients were consistent with an increased volume of distribution of hexanol relative to THO, due to the lipid content of kidney cortical tissue.
