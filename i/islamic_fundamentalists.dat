5|$|The Libyan anti-Gaddafist {{movement}} {{brought together}} a {{diverse array of}} groups, which had varied motives and objectives. It comprised monarchists {{and members of the}} old, pre-Gaddafist elite, conservative nationalists who backed his Arab nationalist agenda but opposed his left-wing economic reforms, technocrats who had their future prospects stunted by the coup, and <b>Islamic</b> <b>fundamentalists</b> who opposed his radical reforms.|$|E

25|$|<b>Islamic</b> <b>fundamentalists</b> {{spoke out}} against {{the idea of a}} woman leader, {{claiming}} that it was un-Islamic. Their propaganda foregrounded what they presented as her un-Islamic behaviour, including a photo of her dancing in a Parisian nightclub. Zia loyalists and <b>Islamic</b> <b>fundamentalists</b> united to form a new political party, Islami Jamhoori Ittehad (IJI), which was funded by the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). The ISI also engaged in vote rigging in an attempt to secure an IJI victory. Despite these attempts, Bhutto led the PPP to victory in the election, taking 93 of the 205 contested seats. The IJI took only 54 seats. This meant that the PPP had the largest number of seats, although not a clear majority. Both the PPP and IJI courted independent MPs hoping to woo them to their side, and unsuccessful attempts were also made by the country's right-wing forces to convince some of the elected PPP parliamentarians to switch allegiance to the IJI.|$|E

25|$|The {{most notable}} trend of Islamic fundamentalism, Salafism, {{is based upon}} a literal reading of the Qur'an and Sunnah without relying on the interpretations of Islamic jurists or Imams, rejecting the need for Taqlid. Fundamentalist Protestantism is similar, in that the 'traditions of men' and the Church Fathers are {{rejected}} {{in favor of a}} literalist interpretation of the Bible, which is seen as inerrant. <b>Islamic</b> <b>Fundamentalists</b> and Protestant Fundamentalists often reject contextual interpretation.|$|E

25|$|On April 18, 2001, Popkov {{was assassinated}} {{near the village}} of Alkhan-Kala, Chechnya, while {{delivering}} medical supplies to civilians after a battle had recently taken place there.

25|$|As part of {{independent}} Indonesia, Bogor {{has a significant}} role in the cultural, scientific and economic development of the country and West Java in particular – in part due to the legacy of infrastructure built during the colonial period. Its special position was further reinforced by the transformation of the former summer residence of the governor-general into the summer palace of the President of Indonesia. In the 1990s–2000s, the city regularly hosted various international events, such as ministry-level meetings of the Asia-Pacific institutions and the APEC summit of 15 November 1994. Since 2008, a Christian church congregation in Bogor has been embroiled with <b>Islamic</b> <b>fundamentalists</b> over the building permit for their new church.|$|E

25|$|Israeli forces {{advancing}} {{along the}} coast also completed the capture of Sidon. Paratroopers attacked the Kasbah while a combined force of Golani Brigade infantry and tanks attacked Ain al-Hilweh. The Kasbah was secured in three days; the paratroopers advanced cautiously and managed to take it without suffering any casualties. However, the fighting at Ain al-Hilweh was to prove some of the fiercest of the entire war. The camp was heavily fortified and defended by PLO fighters and <b>Islamic</b> <b>fundamentalists.</b> The defenders fought fiercely over every alley and house, with civilians who wanted to surrender shot by the fundamentalists. The Israeli advance was slow and was supported by massive air and artillery bombardment. The IDF employed its previous tactics of urging civilians to leave with loudspeakers before attacking an area. It took about eight days the camp to fall, with the battle culminating in a last stand by the defenders at the camp mosque, which was blown up by the IDF.|$|E
25|$|Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League (BAKSAL) {{the only}} legally {{recognized}} party of Bangladesh founded on 7 June 1975 following the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of Bangladesh. Mujib's government soon began encountering increased dissatisfaction and unrest. His programs of nationalization and industrial socialism suffered {{from lack of}} trained personnel, inefficiency, rampant corruption, and poor leadership. Mujib focused almost entirely on national issues and thus neglected local issues and government. The party and central government exercised full control and democracy was weakened, with virtually no elections organized at the grass roots or local levels. Political opposition included communists as well as <b>Islamic</b> <b>fundamentalists,</b> who were angered by the declaration of a secular state. Mujib was criticized for nepotism in appointing family members to important positions. A famine in 1974 further intensified the food crisis, and devastated agriculture– the mainstay of the economy. Intense criticism of Mujib arose over the lack of political leadership, a flawed pricing policy, and rising inflation amidst heavy losses suffered by the nationalized industries. Mujib's ambitious social programs performed poorly, owing to scarcity of resources, funds, and personnel, and caused unrest amongst the masses.|$|E

Conversely, <b>Islamic</b> <b>fundamentalists</b> strongly opposed his social and economic reforms. He was internationally condemned as a dictator whose authoritarian administration violated the human rights of Libyan citizens and financed global terrorism.|$|E
