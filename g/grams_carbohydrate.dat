40|$|INVESTIGATIONS of {{patients}} with chronic ulcerative colitis have been car-ried out in three main fields, namely, glucose tolerance {{and its relation to}} metabolism, blood vitamin levels and the factors involved in rectal bleeding such as capillary fragility and blood prothrombin clotting time determina-tions. One object of these studies was to determine if any information could be obtained regarding the absorption from the gastrointestinal tract of carbohydrates and vitamins, and the metabolism of carbohydrates in patients with chronic ulcerative lesions of the large bowel. Methods. All of the patients studied had suffered from the disease for periods of more than one year and had either been hospitalized or treated as ambulatory patients. Before studies were instituted all patients were on an especially prepared diet schedule which consisted essentially of high protein, high vitamin, low residue foods. This diet contained about 2000 calories with the following distribution: 85 grams protein, 200 <b>grams</b> <b>carbohydrate,</b> 85 grams fat.

40|$|Peanut {{butter is}} a paste made from peanuts that are roasted and ground. Salt, and {{sometimes}} sugar, are added for flavor. To keep oil and solids from separating, additives {{referred to as}} stabilizers are often used. In “natural” peanut butter without stabilizers, oil and solids may separate. At home, if the peanut butter separates, do not pour off the oil. Instead, stir until the peanut butter is mixed well. Otherwise, {{it may be too}} stiff to spread. Important Properties of Peanut Butter Peanut butter is a good and inexpensive source of protein. Peanut butter can be safely stored at room tempera-ture and requires no refrigeration. How Nutritious Is Peanut Butter? Peanut butter is a good source of protein, folic acid and other B vitamins, minerals and dietary fiber. Whether you choose smooth or chunky peanut butter, the nutrient content is the same. A two-tablespoon serving of peanut butter provides 188 calories and these nutrients: Protein 7. 9 <b>grams</b> <b>Carbohydrate</b> 6. 6 grams Cholesterol 0 gram...|$|E
5000|$|Patients {{can also}} use their total daily dose (TDD) of insulin to {{estimate}} how many <b>grams</b> of <b>carbohydrates</b> will be [...] "covered" [...] by 1 unit of insulin, and using this result, estimate how many units of insulin should be administered depending on the carbohydrate content of their meal. For example, if the patient determines that 1 unit of insulin will cover 15 <b>grams</b> of <b>carbohydrates,</b> then they must administer 5 units of insulin before consuming a meal that contains 75 <b>grams</b> of <b>carbohydrates.</b>|$|R

50|$|When {{carbohydrate}} counting is used without insulin, {{it can be}} used as a tool {{to manage}} blood sugar levels. A certain number of <b>carbohydrate</b> <b>grams</b> or <b>carbohydrate</b> units is consumed with each meal and with each snack. In keeping the carbohydrate at a certain level, the blood sugar is able to remain within a normal level. The American Diabetes Association recommends starting at around 45-60 <b>carbohydrate</b> <b>grams</b> (3-4 carb units) at each meal, with potential to increase or decrease that amount.|$|R

50|$|If {{for some}} reasons {{you need to}} stay with faster insulin analogues such as Humalog or novorapid/ Novolog, for example if you cannot wait the 30 minutes(30-45 and not same for every one) that are {{required}} with regular insulins, you may use these analogues, but again {{it is not the}} best thing to do. Then with these analogues you will start with half the dose, and probably end up with 2/3, compared to regular insulin. So for instance you will start with 1 unit of Humalog or novorapid/Novolog for every 16 <b>grams</b> of <b>carbohydrates,</b> and 1 unit for each 4 ounces of protein foods. Then 2/3 will means that you will inject 1 unit of Humalog or Novorapid/Novolog for each 12 <b>grams</b> of <b>carbohydrates,</b> and 1 unit for every 3 ounces of protein food.|$|R
