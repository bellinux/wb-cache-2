5|$|Forster's main interest, however, {{was again}} {{focused on the}} social {{behavior}} of people, as 15 years earlier in the Pacific. The national uprisings in Flanders and Brabant and the revolution in France sparked his curiosity. The journey through these regions, together with the Netherlands and England, where citizens' freedoms were equally well developed, in the end helped him to resolve his own political opinions. From that time on {{he was to be}} a confident opponent of the ancien régime. With other German scholars, he welcomed the outbreak of the revolution as a clear consequence of the Enlightenment. As early as July 30, 1789, shortly after he heard about the Storming of the Bastille, he wrote to his father-in-law, philologist Christian Gottlob Heyne, that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>beautiful</b> to see what philosophy had nurtured in people's minds and then had realized in the state. To educate people about their rights in this way, he wrote, was after all the surest way; the rest would then result as if by itself.|$|E
25|$|At Greccio near Assisi, around 1220, Francis celebrated Christmas {{by setting}} up the first known presepio or crèche (Nativity scene). His nativity imagery {{reflected}} the scene in traditional paintings. He used real animals to create a living scene so that the worshipers could contemplate {{the birth of the}} child Jesus in a direct way, making use of the senses, especially sight. Thomas of Celano, a biographer of both Francis and Saint Bonaventure, tells how he used only a straw-filled manger (feeding trough) set between a real ox and donkey. According to Thomas, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>beautiful</b> in its simplicity, with the manger acting as the altar for the Christmas Mass.|$|E
500|$|The song's lyrics {{revolve around}} the pursuit of love, {{functioning}} as an ode to Fantasia's husband Kendall Taylor. Throughout the single, Fantasia reveals her personal [...] "journey to happiness" [...] by singing, [...] "When I met you, I met me too." [...] She also shares memories of her past heartbreaks using lyrics such as: “Listen to me when I tell you/Without him {{there would be no}} you/So yes, I thank my ex a little still." [...] The song ends with a spoken word monologue, in which Fantasia details the first time she met Taylor. This part of the track includes lines such as: [...] "I still remember the day, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>beautiful.</b> And if I hadn’t went through the things I went through before then I wouldn’t know how special you are." ...|$|E

500|$|Dave Marsh was {{the first}} music critic to employ the term punk rock: In the May 1971 issue of Creem, he {{described}} ? and the Mysterians, {{one of the most}} popular 1960s garage rock acts, as giving a [...] "landmark exposition of punk rock". Later in 1971, in his fanzine Who Put the Bomp, Greg Shaw wrote about [...] "what I have chosen to call [...] "punkrock" [...] bands—white teenage hard rock of '64–66 (Standells, Kingsmen, Shadows of Knight, etc.)". Lester Bangs used the term [...] "punk rock" [...] in several articles written in the early 1970s to refer to mid-1960s garage acts. In his June 1971 piece in Creem, [...] "Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung," [...] he wrote, [...] "then punk bands started cropping up who were writing their own songs but taking the Yardbirds' sound and reducing it to this kind of goony fuzztone clatter. ... oh, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>beautiful,</b> it was pure folklore, Old America, and sometimes I think those were the best days ever." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1960s, garage rock had no {{name and}} was not {{thought of as a}} genre, but as typical {{elemental}} rock of the period. [...] When it began to be recognised in the early 1970s, [...] "garage rock" [...] was not the name initially prescribed. [...] Between 1971-1973 certain rock critics began to speak nostalgically of mid-1960s garage bands (and artists perceived to be in their tradition) as a genre and for several years used the term [...] "punk rock" [...] to characterize it, making it the first musical form to bear the description. [...] Conjuring up the mid-1960s, Lester Bangs in 1971 wrote: [...] "...then punk bands started cropping up who were writing their own songs but taking the Yardbirds' sound and reducing it to this kind of goony fuzztone clatter... oh, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>beautiful,</b> it was pure folklore, Old America, and sometimes I think those were the best days ever".|$|E
500|$|... "Climax" [...] {{was written}} by Usher, Redd Stylez, Ariel Rechtshaid, and Diplo, who also {{produced}} the song. Diplo introduced the song's concept to Usher, who was working {{with him on a}} new album. Usher wanted to expand his music's style and depth by working with Diplo. Diplo recounted the experience in an interview for The Guardian, saying that [...] "I had explained to him about a moment I had with a girl where I felt like I could die with her and be content, but I didn't and life moved on, and that point in my life was over. It was a sad feeling but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>beautiful.</b> He was relating with me about the idea and how many times you think things are perfect and feel that way but they can pass." [...] They discussed the concept throughout the song's development and how it relates to Usher's life, as Diplo [...] "tried to help realise these lyrics and feelings." [...] After conceiving some melody lines, they wrote the song in about an hour.|$|E

500|$|During the {{production}} of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' 1991 album Blood Sugar Sex Magik, producer Rick Rubin regularly visited singer Anthony Kiedis to review Kiedis' new material. He found a poem titled [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] while flipping through Kiedis' notebook and instantly took an interest in the poignant lyrics. Rubin suggested that Kiedis show it {{to the rest of the}} band: [...] "I thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>beautiful.</b> I said 'We've got to do this.'" [...] Kiedis was reluctant, as he felt the poem was too emotional and did not fit the Chili Peppers' style. After singing the poem to guitarist John Frusciante and drummer Chad Smith, Kiedis recalls that they [...] "got up and walked over to their instruments and started finding the beat and guitar chords to match it". Frusciante chose the chords he played in the introduction to balance out the depressing nature of the lyrics, saying [...] "my brain interpreted it as being a really sad song so I thought if the lyrics are really sad like that I should write some chords that are happier".|$|E
500|$|The {{turning point}} of the series was the third Test. On the first day, Verity again {{dismissed}} Bradman and the England bowlers performed well in good batting conditions before rain altered {{the state of the}} pitch. Australia declared their innings closed at 200 for nine and after losing nine wickets for76, England also declared, hoping to make Australia bat on a still-difficult pitch. In much easier batting conditions, Australia made 564, of which Bradman scored 270. Verity bowled nearly 38 eight-ball overs and took three for 79. Cardus wrote: [...] "Verity was magnificent... In his absence Bradman might have scored another 100runs. Nothing but consummate length and flight could have checked Bradman, in circumstances made for Bradman... Every run from Verity had to be earnt. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>beautiful</b> bowling, delightful to the eye and intellect." [...] Wisden's report said: [...] "Voce and Verity were outstanding England bowlers. The latter kept an immaculate length and allowed no batsman to take liberties with him." [...] England were bowled out for 323 and lost the game.|$|E

Among his contemporaries, Dutch star Johan Cruyff stated; [...] "Pelé was the only footballer who surpassed the boundaries of logic." [...] Brazil's 1970 FIFA World Cup-winning captain Carlos Alberto Torres opined; [...] "His great secret was improvisation. Those things he did were in one moment. He had an extraordinary perception of the game." [...] Tostão, his strike partner at the 1970 World Cup; [...] "Pelé was the greatest – he was simply flawless. And off the pitch he is always smiling and upbeat. You never see him bad-tempered. He loves being Pelé." [...] His Brazilian teammate Clodoaldo commented on the adulation he witnessed; [...] "In some countries they wanted to touch him, in some they wanted to kiss him. In others they even kissed the ground he walked on. I thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>beautiful,</b> just beautiful." [...] Former Real Madrid and Hungary star Ferenc Puskás stated; [...] "The greatest player in history was Di Stefano. I refuse to classify Pelé as a player. He was above that." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{previous}} years, {{the organizers}} {{had made the}} race easier for the Italian favorites by including fewer hard climbs. With the absence of Italian Francesco Moser from this edition, the race organizers included many famous and difficult climbs, such as the Gavia Pass. Moser himself stated that the route contained many difficult climbs and was not helping Italian cycling to prosper {{at a time when}} he believed it to be ailing. When asked about the route for the 1988 edition, [...] rider Bob Roll said [...] "Those sons of bitches put every mountain they could find in the race that year." [...] Three-time winner Gino Bartali also believed the route to be very difficult and in favor of non-Italian competitors. Gino Sala also felt the route was harsher than in years past and that the team time trial could influence the overall classification greatly. La Stampa writer Gian Paolo Ormezzano praised the route saying <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>beautiful</b> and well crafted but contained one flaw, in that the race did not finish in any major Italian city. He also expressed his delight with the uphill time trial to Valico del Vetriolo as well as the inclusion of the Stelvio, Rombo and Gavia mountain passes.|$|E
500|$|Critics mostly {{reacted with}} acclaim for the mash-up of [...] "I Feel Pretty / Unpretty".

There was a surprisingly balanced and incredibly lovely tone." [...] All three writers of The Atlantic review praised the mash-up: Patrick Burns said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>beautiful,</b> and noted that [...] "the arrangement was clever, the ladies sounded great, and the song was placed perfectly into the plot of two characters who were restored a bit of their depth in this episode", Brown stated that the song was lovely, and Kevin Fallon felt that it was [...] "unexpectedly gorgeous and haunting", and noted that it was [...] "yet another example of how skilled the music directors are at these mash-ups." [...] Semigran felt that it was the best performance of the night, and TV Line Michael Slezak gave the piece an [...] "A", and said that it was a [...] "vocally and visually stunning set piece for the unlikeliest of duet partners." [...] Flandez commented that the song [...] "floated like gossamer between Rachel and Quinn as they beautifully poured the sentiments of ugly ducklings", and Futterman wrote, [...] "It's a poignant moment, and the inclusion of West Side Story 'I Feel Pretty' makes for a great pop/theater mash-up that reminds us of what Glee is at its heart." ...|$|E

May has commented that he considered his music a direct continuation of the European synthesizer tradition. He also identified Japanese synthpop act Yellow Magic Orchestra, particularly member Ryuichi Sakamoto, and British band Ultravox, as influences, along with Kraftwerk. YMO's song [...] "Technopolis" [...] (1979), a tribute to Tokyo as an electronic mecca, is considered an [...] "interesting contribution" [...] to the development of Detroit techno, foreshadowing concepts that Atkins and Davis would later explore with Cybotron.|$|E

[...] In September 2000, the relationship abruptly ended when Moakler, who was at home watching the Latin Grammy Awards on television, saw De La Hoya escorting another woman to the show. In December 2000, Moakler filed a $62.5 million palimony suit against her ex-fiancé, claiming he was an alcoholic, abusive to her and to their daughter, and that he used them [...] "as props to promote his public image." [...] The case was {{settled out of court}} in 2001 for an undisclosed amount.
