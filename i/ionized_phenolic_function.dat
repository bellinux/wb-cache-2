LPS-induced gene expression of COX- 2 was markedly inhibited by compound 2 at a concentration of 10 μM and by compound 3 at 100 μM, but was not inhibited by compound 1 at 100 μM. This observation suggests that compound 2 may possess potent anti-inflammatory activity. These ferulic acid-related compounds were able to scavenge the stable 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical. The 50 % inhibitory concentration for DPPH radicals declined in the order 3 (40. 20 mM) > 2 (3. 16 mM) > 1 (0. 145 mM). Compound 1 possessed potent anti-radical activity, but no COX- 2 inhibitory activity, which may be a result of enhancement of its conjugate properties by abstraction of an H atom from the phenolic OH group, causing loss of <b>phenolic</b> <b>function.</b> In contrast, inhibition of COX- 2 expression by compounds 2 and 3 could be caused by their increased <b>phenolic</b> <b>function,</b> which is associated with decreased anti-radical activity.

40|$|Low {{bioavailability}} severely hinders {{exploitation of}} the biomedical potential of resveratrol. Extensive phase-II metabolism and poor water solubility contribute to lowering the concentrations of resveratrol in the bloodstream after oral administration. Prodrugs may provide a solution—protection of the <b>phenolic</b> <b>functions</b> hinders conjugative metabolism and can be exploited to modulate the physicochemical properties of the compound. We report here the synthesis and characterization of carbamate ester derivatives of resveratrol bearing on each nitrogen atom a methyl group and either a methoxy-poly(ethylene glycol) - 350 (mPEG- 350) or a butyl-glucosyl promoiety conferring high water solubility. Ex vivo absorption studies revealed that the butyl-glucosyl conjugate, unlike the mPEG- 350 one, is able to permeate the intestinal wall. In vivo pharmacokinetics confirmed absorption after oral administration and showed that no hydrolysis of the carbamate groups takes place.

40|$|Anthraquinone {{compound}} aloe-emodin (AE) {{has shown}} antineoplastic, antibacterial, antiviral, and antiinflammatory properties and scavenging activity on free radicals. Because of these therapeutic features, AE has been attracting increasing interest {{and could be}} applied in the curing of many diseases. However, until now the physicochemical features of this compound have not been fully investigated; furthermore, its wide application might be hindered by its scarce solubility in aqueous media (∼ 19 μM). The inclusion of AE in nanocarriers, such as cationic liposomes, could allow its delivery effectively and selectively to target sites, reducing side effects in the remaining tissues.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{preparation}} of new benzoyl and/or benzyl substituted 1, 2, 3 -triazole derivatives and their pharmacological evaluation as potential BK channel openers, {{as a part of}} a research program which hypothesized a pharmacophoric structure containing the 1, 2, 3 -triazole ring. The synthetic procedures consist essentially with the 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition of aryl or benzyl azides to the asymmetric alkyne benzoylacetylene to give the wished 4 -benzoyl- 1, 2, 3 -triazole isomers in larger amount. The pharmacological results show that the 1 -(2 - hydroxybenzyl) - 4 -benzyl- 1 H- 1, 2, 3 -triazole possesses high vasorelaxing activity involving the opening of the BK channels. Therefore the structure–activity relationships concerning this pharmacophoric structure confirm the usefulness of a <b>phenolic</b> <b>function</b> in the ortho position of the aromatic ring and would suggest a 1, 2, 3 -triazole model bearing benzyl substituents. In addition such substituents appear more flexible and able to take different conformations with respect to phenyl groups which have higher trend to coplanar conformations...|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of our {{previous}} works, addressed to synthesise new activators of BK potassium channels, and of many suggestions from the international literature, a simple pharmacophoric model, consisting of two suitably substituted phenyl rings bound to various kinds of linkers, was hypothesised. In particular, the effectiveness of the amidic linker was demonstrated, since several benzanilide derivatives showed interesting BK-opener properties. As a development of these benzanilides, in this work we introduced heterocyclic substituents, replacing the aryl ring on the acid side or on the basic one of the amide linker of the above pharmacophore. The pharmacological results indicated some relevant remarks about the structural requirements, needed for a satisfactory BK-opener activity. In particular, the presence of a <b>phenolic</b> <b>function,</b> with a possible H-bond donor role, has been confirmed. Furthermore, the presence of nitrogen heterocycles on the acid side of the amide linker seems to be a negative requirement, while furan and thiophene were well tolerated. On the contrary, the introduction of insaturated heterocyclic rings (pyridine and thiazole) on the basic side of the amide linker, led to satisfactory biological activity, while the presence of aliphatic heterocycles lowered the pharmacological effect.

40|$|Further {{advances}} {{in understanding the}} mechanism of action of resveratrol and its application require new analogs to identify the structural determinants for the cell proliferation inhibition potency. Therefore, we synthesized new trans-resveratrol derivatives by using the Wittig and Heck methods, thus modifying the hydroxylation and methoxylation patterns of the parent molecule. Moreover, we also synthesized new ferrocenylstilbene analogs by using an original protective group in the Wittig procedure. By performing cell proliferation assays we observed that the resveratrol derivatives show inhibition on the human colorectal tumor SW 480 cell line. On the other hand, cell viability/cytotoxicity assays showed a weaker effects on the human hepatoblastoma HepG 2 cell line. Importantly, the lack of effect on non-tumor cells (IEC 18 intestinal epithelium cells) demonstrates the selectivity of these molecules for cancer cells. Here, we show that the numbers and positions of hydroxy and methoxy groups are crucial for the inhibition efficacy. In addition, the presence {{of at least one}} phenolic group is essential for the antitumoral activity. Moreover, in the series of ferrocenylstilbene analogs, the presence of a hidden <b>phenolic</b> <b>function</b> allows for a better solubilization in the cellular environment and significantly increases the antitumoral activity...|$|R
40|$|Diflunisal (DF) is metabolized {{primarily}} to its acyl glucuronide (DAG), phenolic glucuronide (DPG) and sulphate (DS) conjugates. Whereas DPG and DS are stable at physiological pH, DAG is unstable, undergoing hydrolysis (regeneration of DF) and rearrangement (intramolecular acyl {{migration to the}} 2 -, 3 - and 4 -O-acyl-positional isomers). We have compared the in vivo disposition of DAG with that of an equimolar mixture of its three isomers after i. v. administration at 10 mg DF equivalents/kg to conscious, bile-exteriorized rats. After dosing with DAG, excretion in urine and bile (46 % as DAG), hydrolysis (as assessed by recovery of 9 % DPG and 8 % DS resulting from reconjugation of liberated DF) and rearrangement (17 % recovery as isomers of DAG) were important pathways. Highly polar metabolites excreted almost exclusively in bile and accounting for 13 % of the dose were identified as an approximate 4 : 1 mixture of the 2 - and 3 -O-isomers of DAG which had been glucuronidated at the <b>phenolic</b> <b>function</b> of the salicylate ring i. e.

40|$|HE CHEMICAL ASSAY of {{diethylstilbestrol}} {{in extremely}} small amounts {{has not been}} previously accomplished in a satisfactory manner. The ultraviolet absorption of diethyistilbestrol has been proposed as a method (1), but this fails {{in the presence of}} other absorbing substances in tissue extracts. In addition, the absorption curve lacks any sharply defined band. Measurement of the <b>phenolic</b> <b>function</b> (2) suffers from a similar lack of specificity, while methods based on nitration (3, 4, 5) lack sensitivity and specificity. Dingemanse (6) was the first to propose the use of an-timony pentachioride as a reagent for dliethyistilbestrol, and this reagent has been adopted by Warren, Goulden, and Robinson (7) and by Jones and Deatherage (8). A sensitivity of 0. 002 mg. has been claimed for the antimony pentachioride reaction but our experience with it has not been as fortunate, owing to rather high blank optical densities produced by unknown chromogens and to a day-to-day variation of optical densities of standard solutions. We have therefore sought a different approach to this problem. Diethylstilbestrol reacts with bromine under various conditions to form colored compounds or complexes (9, 10), similar to the behavior of certain 17 -a-hydroxysteroids (11). Cocking (12) recently described two reactions of this type, involving diethyistilbestrol, which appeared to be of promise in the analytic sense. We have examined one of these in some detail, and present herewith a chemical assay based on Cocking’s observations. The proposed method seems to be quite specific, fairly sensitive, and applicable to the assay of diethyistilbestrol in tissue extracts...|$|R
40|$|Treated wood is {{frequently}} used for construction. However, {{there is a}} need to ensure that biocides used for the treatment are not a threat for people or environment. The paper focused on Pinus sylvestris treated with copper-boron-azole (CBA), containing tebuconazole as organic biocide and monoethanolamine (Mea). This study investigates chemical mechanisms of fixation and mobilisation involved in the leaching process of the used inorganic and organic biocides in CBA. A pH dependent leaching test was performed, followed by a set of complementary analysis methods in order to identify and quantify the species released from wood. The main findings of this study are: - Organic compounds are released from untreated and treated wood; the quantity of released total organic carbon, carboxylic and <b>phenolic</b> <b>functions</b> increasing with the pH. - Nitrogen containing compounds, i. e. mainly Mea and its reaction products with extractives, are released in important quantities from CBA treated wood, especially at low pH. - The release of copper is the result of competitive reactions: fixation via complexation reactions and complexation with extractives in the liquid phase. The specific pH dependency of Cu leaching is explained by the competition of ligands for protonation and complexation. - Tebuconazole is released to a lesser extent relative to its initial content. Its fixation on solid wood structure seems to be influenced by pH, suggesting interactions with -OH groups on wood. Boron release appears to be pH independent and very high. This confirms its weak fixation on wood and also no or weak interaction with the extractives. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

The protonation constants of the ligand and the thermodynamic stabilities of the 1 : 1 and 2 : 1 (metal/ligand) complexes with these metal ions have been investigated by means of potentiometric measurements in aqueous solutions. The mononuclear [M(L) ] complexes show remarkably high stability suggesting that, along with {{the large number of}} nitrogen donors available for metal binding, deprotonated <b>phenolic</b> <b>functions</b> are also involved in binding the metal ion. The mononuclear complexes [M(L) ] show a marked tendency to add a second metal ion to afford binuclear species. The formation of complexes [M 2 (H 2 L) ] 4 + occurs at neutral or slightly acidic pH and is generally followed by metal-assisted deprotonation of the phenolic groups to give [M 2 (HL) ] 3 + and [M 2 (L) ] 2 + in weakly basic solutions. The complexation properties of H 2 L have also been investigated in the solid state.

The compound contains two five-coordinate trigonal-bipyramidal tin atoms with the two butyl groups in equatorial positions; the third tin atom has a seven-coordinate pentagonal-bipyramidal geometry with the two butyl groups in apical positions. The bonds of the salicylaldoxime ligands to the metal atoms are inequivalent. Both ligands are bound to the seven-coordinate tin atom through the oxygen atom originating from the <b>phenolic</b> <b>function</b> and through the nitrogen atom of the aldoxime function. In the ligand that binds as HONZO, the phenolate oxygen atom further coordinates a five-coordinate tin atom. In the ligand that coordinates as ONZO, the NO oxygen is bonded to the other five-coordinate atom. The H- 1, C- 13, and Sn- 119 NMR data are in agreement with such a structure existing as a major species M in solution. However, the NMR spectra also reveal the presence of three other minor species in solution, m 1, m 2, and m 3.

Both ligands show two diethylenetriamine units separated by the 1, 10 -bis(2 -phenol) (BPH) or the phenol (PH) for L 1 and L 2, respectively. Both ligands are fluorescence-emitting systems in all fields of pH examined, with L 1 showing a higher fluorescence emission than L 2. In particular, the emission of fluorescence mainly depends on the protonation state of the <b>phenolic</b> <b>functions</b> and thus on pH. The highest emitting species is H 3 L 3 + for both systems, where the BPH is monodeprotonated (in L 1) and the PH is in the phenolate form (in L 2). On the contrary, when BPH and PH are in their neutral form both ligands show the lowest fluorescence, since H-bonds occurring between the phenol and the closest tertiary amine functions decrease fluorescence. The Zn(II) -dinuclear species are also fluorescent in the pH range where they exist; the highest emitting species being [Zn 2 (H 2 L 1) ] 2 + and [Zn 2 (H 1 L 2) ] 3 + which are present in a wide range of pH including the physiological one. Fluorescence experiments carried out at physiological pH highlighted that, in the case of L 1, the presence of Zn(II) ion in solution produces a simultaneous change in lem with a drop in fluorescence due to the formation of the [Zn 2 (H 2 L 1) ] 2 + species, while, in the case of L 2, it gives rise to a strong CHEF effect (a twenty-fold enhancement was observed) due to the formation of the [Zn 2 (H 1 L 2) ] 3 + species.

Our studies indicate that this reduced risk is potentially because of the modulation of postprandial glucose increase by phenolics present in apples via inhibition ofα-glucosidase. Phenolic content was evaluated during 3 months of postharvest storage of four varieties of apples and results indicated positive linkage to enhanced postharvest preservation andα-glucosidase inhibition. These in vitro results along with existing epidemiological studies provide strong biochemical rationale for further animal or human clinical studies...|$|R
40|$|Coniferous {{trees are}} rich in {{chemical}} compounds such as terpenes, fats/fatty acids, waxes, tannins and <b>phenolics,</b> which <b>function</b> to protect the tree against insect pests and diseases, and as energy reserves. Compounds extractable with organic solvents typically comprise about 3 to 5 percent of total biomass on a whole tree dry basis, and may represent up to 25 percent in certain tree parts, such as heartwood in the inner basal portion of the stem and roots. Trees may develop higher levels or altered profiles of extractives when subjected to stressors, including mechanical injury, water-deficit, pest attack, or atmospheric pollutants. Terpenes are {{a large group of}} compounds having molecular formulas that are multiples of C 5 H 8. Oleoresin is an important natural product that is a mixture of resins (diterpene acids) that are normally a solid material at room temperature, and volatile essential oils (mono- and sesqui-terpenes) that serve as a solvent to maintain the oleoresin in a fluid state. Oleoresin is synthesized by the thin-walled epithelial cells within the wood parenchyma tissue. In pines and firs, these structures are organized as a network of interconnected radial and longitudinal ducts which store oleoresin at elevated pressure and transport it to injury sites. Oleoresin is especially abundant in certain pines, such as Pinus elliottii, P. palustris, P. taeda, and P. ponderosa. Pine oleoresin is commercially produced from about 20 pine species in both natural an...|$|R
40|$|Background: Acai (Euterpe oleracea) is a polyphenol-rich fruit {{marketed as}} {{beneficial}} for health. Experimental data showing improvements in health markers arising from acai consumption in humans is limited. Objective: The {{objective of the}} present study was to investigate the effect of acai consumption on acute changes in vascular function and on other disease risk markers, including postprandial plasma insulin, glucose, and oxidative stress. Design: Twenty-three healthy male volunteers, aged 30 – 65 y and with a body mass index (in kg/m 2) of 25 – 30, completed a randomized,controlled, high-fat challenge, double-blind, crossover, acute dietary intervention trial. The volunteers consumed either an acai-based smoothie (AS) or a macronutrient-matched control smoothie (PS) together with a high-fat breakfast meal challenge. The primary endpoint was the assessment of endothelial function in the brachial artery by flow-mediated dilatation (FMD). Results: The acute consumption of an AS containing 694 mg total <b>phenolics</b> improved vascular <b>function,</b> with postprandial increases in FMD from baseline of 1. 4...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} flavonoids, a {{subgroup}} of phenolic compounds produced by plants, {{and how they}} affect the herbivorous larvae of lepidopterans and sawflies. The {{first part of the}} literature review examines different techniques to analyze the chemical structures of flavonoids and their concentrations in biological samples. These techniques include, for example, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The second part of the literature review studies how <b>phenolic</b> compounds <b>function</b> in the metabolism of larvae. The harmful oxidation reactions of phenolic compounds in insect guts are also emphasized. In addition to the negative effects, many insect species have evolved the use of phenolic compounds for their own benefit. In the experimental part of the thesis, high concentrations of complex flavonoid oligoglycosides were found in the hemolymph (the circulatory fluid of insects) of birch and pine sawflies. The larvae produced these compounds from simple flavonoid precursors present in the birch leaves and pine needles. Flavonoid glycosides were also found in the cocoon walls of sawflies, which suggested that flavonoids were used in the construction of cocoons. The second part of the experimental work studied the modifications of phenolic compounds in conditions that mimicked the alkaline guts of lepidopteran larvae. It was found that the 24 plant species studied and their individual phenolic compounds had variable capacities to function as oxidative defenses in alkaline conditions. The excrements of lepidopteran and sawfly species were studied to see how different types of phenolics were processed by the larvae. These results suggested that phenolic compounds were oxidized, hydrolyzed, or modified in other ways during their passage through the digestive tract of the larvae...|$|R

40|$|The {{principal}} {{aim of this}} research was to determine the influence of an increasing wildfire history on the recovery at short and long term of soil organic matter (SOM) composition and microbial properties. The contemporary wildfire events (since 1950) were recorded for 27 plots located on the siliceous part of the French Mediterranean region (Maures mountain ranges). A wildfire history index was built, tested and calculated in order to display numerical values representative of the different wildfire history parameters (i. e. number of fires, time since fire and mean fire interval). Microbial basal respiration and biomass were analysed as well as intensity of the use of 31 C-substrates, catabolic diversity and C-substrates utilisation profiles. Furthermore, a qualitative characterisation of the SOM was carried out by solid state 13 C NMR. Potential drivers of the microbial recovery were identified by studying the relationships between microbial activities and chemical functions of SOM. Our results showed that fire histories resulting in considerable losses or alterations of SOM, such as recent or close fires, decreased the microbial catabolic evenness. This could be attributed to a preferential utilisation of N-containing compounds and complex substrates such as aromatic and polymers reflecting a greater N microbial demand and a selection of specific catabolic functions. Moreover, a large number of fires (4 fires in 57 years compared to 1 - 2) resulted in lasting degradation of the relative intensity of methyl C function in polymethylene, O-Alkyl C, aromatic C and <b>phenolic</b> C <b>functions</b> inducing a slow-down in recovery of microbial properties. These results also confirm our hypothesis that some chemical functions of SOM can be in equilibrium with wildfire history. Finally, this research demonstrates that FT-NIR analysis {{can be used as a}} valuable tool to assess both the wildfire history and the vulnerability of soil quality to shifts in historical fire regimes...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of crown gall tumors by Agrobacterium tumefaciens {{requires that the}} virulence (vir) genes be induced by chemical signals which consist of specific phenolic compounds and monosaccharides, synthesized at plant wound sites. Signal transduction in the activation of these genes is mediated by the VirA-VirG two-component regulatory system, together with ChvE, a glucose-galactose binding protein which interacts with VirA. We have previously presented genetic evidence that virA senses phenolic compounds directly (Y. -W. Lee, S. Jin, W. -S. Sim, and E. W. Nester, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92 : 12245 – 12249, 1995). The vir genes of strain KU 12 can be induced by 4 -hydroxyacetophenone, p-coumaric acid, and phenol, whereas these same phenolic compounds are weak inducers of the vir genes of strain A 6. In this report, we show that a specific inducing sugar can broaden the specificity of the phenolic compound which VirA senses. 4 -Hydroxyacetophenone and other related <b>phenolic</b> compounds <b>function</b> as inducing <b>phenolic</b> compounds with the virA gene of A 6 if arabinose replaces glucose as the inducing sugar. We further demonstrate that this broadened specificity for phenolic inducers results from the increased level of ChvE through induction by arabinose via the regulatory protein GbpR. If high levels of ChvE are present, then poorly inducing phenolic compounds can induce the vir genes to high levels in combination with glucose. Comparing the induction response of the wild type and that of a VirA mutant with a mutation in its receiver domain revealed that {{the activity of the}} receiver domain is controlled by the periplasmic domain. We discuss these observations in terms of how VirA senses and transduces signals elicited by the two classes of plant signal molecules...|$|R
