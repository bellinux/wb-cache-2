50|$|According to the US Congressional investigation, the rig's blowout preventer, a <b>fail-safe</b> <b>device</b> fitted at {{the base}} of the well, built by Cameron International Corporation, had a {{hydraulic}} leak and a failed battery, and therefore failed. On 19 August, Admiral Thad Allen ordered BP to keep the blowout preventer to be used as evidence in any court actions.|$|E
50|$|Shortly afterwards, Vek {{was taken}} to Nox by a <b>fail-safe</b> <b>device</b> in the Deathlords ship {{when he tried to}} use it to rescue the Space Shuttle, where he {{convinced}} the Council that the death judgement was wrong and to lift the sentence of death from Earth; however his crimes against Nox meant he was returned to Earth in exile.|$|E
50|$|Blowout preventers come in {{a variety}} of styles, sizes and {{pressure}} ratings. Several individual units serving various functions are combined to compose a blowout preventer stack.

40|$|Remote power {{controllers}} (RPCs) {{are solid}} state devices that combine in one unit {{the capability to}} perform all the needed functions of load switching, overload protection, and a direct indication of whether the load is on or off. They provide total system protection of equipment and wires. RPCs {{are designed to be}} located near the load and communicate control and status information remotely via low level signals of a few milliwatts. The design and operation of the RPC are considered, taking into account the operation of an RPC, the RPC power switch and drive circuits, control and trip circuits, <b>fail-safe</b> <b>devices,</b> and RPC overcurrent protection. Attention is given to the RPC development status, RPC applications, and RPC perspectives...|$|R
40|$|The {{currently}} preferred {{means of}} particulate removal from process or combustion gas generated by advanced coal-based power production processes is filtration with candle filters. However, candle filters have not shown the requisite reliability to be commercially viable for hot gas clean up for either integrated gasifier combined cycle (IGCC) or pressurized fluid bed combustion (PFBC) processes. Even a single candle failure {{can lead to}} unacceptable ash breakthrough, which can result in (a) damage to highly sensitive and expensive downstream equipment, (b) unacceptably low system on-stream factor, and (c) unplanned outages. The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) has {{recognized the need to}} have <b>fail-safe</b> <b>devices</b> installed within or downstream from candle filters. In addition to CeraMem, DOE has contracted with Siemens-Westinghouse, the Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC) at the University of North Dakota, and the Southern Research Institute (SRI) to develop novel <b>fail-safe</b> <b>devices.</b> Siemens-Westinghouse is evaluating honeycomb-based filter devices on the clean-side of the candle filter that can operate up to 870 C. The EERC is developing a highly porous ceramic disk with a sticky yet temperature-stable coating that will trap dust in the event of filter failure. SRI is developing the Full-Flow Mechanical Safeguard Device that provides a positive seal for the candle filter. Operation of the SRI device is triggered by the higher-than-normal gas flow from a broken candle. The CeraMem approach {{is similar to that of}} Siemens-Westinghouse and involves the development of honeycomb-based filters that operate on the clean-side of a candle filter. The overall objective of this project is to fabricate and test silicon carbide-based honeycomb failsafe filters for protection of downstream equipment in advanced coal conversion processes. The fail-safe filter, installed directly downstream of a candle filter, should have the capability for stopping essentially all particulate bypassing a broken or leaking candle while having a low enough pressure drop to allow the candle to be backpulse-regenerated. Forward-flow pressure drop should increase by no more than 20 % because of incorporation of the fail-safe filter...|$|R
50|$|The {{premise of}} Red Star Rogue {{is that a}} <b>fail-safe</b> <b>device</b> {{designed}} to be activated {{in the event of}} an unauthorised fire command of its nuclear missiles caused 2 catastrophic explosions (monitored by U.S. technology at the time) resulting in sinking the submarine. The 11 extra crewmen have never been satisfactorily identified, and K-129's crew manifest was listed as missing by Russian authorities. An ID photograph of a sailor found in the wreck has never been identified. Red Star Rogue claims the changing relations with China and Russia in the early 1970's, forged by Nixon and Kissinger, were enabled by the K-129 incident.|$|E

5000|$|An unusual form of {{naturally}} occurring electromagnetism is {{present on the}} island. While physical objects seem {{to be affected by}} the time passage, electromagnetism, such as radio waves are not affected.

Radzinski was very vocal in manipulating electromagnetism [...] "in ways we have never dreamed before". At the end of [...] "Live Together, Die Alone", when Desmond has used the <b>fail-safe</b> <b>device</b> in the Swan Station to destroy it, a monitoring station in the Antarctic detects the electromagnetic event.

5000|$|Checking {{formally}} or informally specified properties against executing {{systems or}} programs {{is an old}} topic (notable examples are dynamic typing in software, or <b>fail-safe</b> <b>devices</b> or watchdog timers in hardware), whose precise roots are hard to identify. The terminology runtime verification was formally introduced as {{the name of a}} 2001 workshop aimed at addressing problems at the boundary between formal verification and testing. For large code bases manually writing test cases turns out to be very time consuming. In addition, not all errors can be detected during development. Early constributions to automate verification have been made at the NASA Ames Research Center by Klaus Havelund and Grigore Rosu to archive high safety standards in spacecrafts, rovers and avionics technology. [...] They proposed a tool to verify specifications in temporal logic and to detect race conditions and deadlocks in Java programs by analyzing single execution paths.|$|R
40|$|GENI Project: Varentec is {{developing}} compact, low-cost transmission power controllers with fractional power rating for controlling power flow on transmission networks. The technology will enhance grid operations through improved {{use of current}} assets and by dramatically {{reducing the number of}} transmission lines that have to be built to meet increasing contributions of renewable energy sources like wind and solar. The proposed transmission controllers would allow for the dynamic control of voltage and power flow, improving the gridâ€™s ability to dispatch power in real time to the places where it is most needed. The controllers would work as <b>fail-safe</b> <b>devices</b> whereby the grid would be restored to its present operating state {{in the event of a}} controller malfunction instead of failing outright. The ability to affordably and dynamically control power flow with adequate fail-safe switchgear could open up new competitive energy markets which are not possible under the current regulatory structure and technology base...|$|R

50|$|The {{film was}} novelized by Piers Anthony. The novel and film {{correspond}} fairly well, although Anthony was evidently working {{from an earlier}} script than the one used for the film, and was criticized for the ending of his book which removed the ambiguity whether the events of Total Recall are real or a dream. In addition, the novel had a subplot wherein the aliens planted a <b>fail-safe</b> <b>device</b> within their Mars technology, so {{that if it were}} misused or destroyed, the local star would go nova and therefore prevent the species from entering the galactic community. It coincided with a comment earlier in the novel that astronomers were noticing an abnormal number of recent supernovae, giving an indication that the aliens seeded their tech as part of a galactic experiment in technological maturity. Instead of mentioning that he dreamt of her earlier in the film, Melina mentions she was once a model, explaining how Quaid could have seen her on the screen at Rekall.|$|E
5000|$|The lever {{extends to}} the right from a {{vertical}} control shaft. The lever has a neutral position with the lever extended directly {{to the right of}} the pivot. Braking is applied by progressively rotating the lever clockwise, which, due to the position of the level relative to the pivot, is actuated by the operator moving their hand closer to the body - to the [...] "rear". Forward traction is added by rotating the lever counter-clockwise, or [...] "forward". As the lever translates linear motion by the operator into rotary motion of the lever, the level is normally topped with a rotating knob at the right end. This allows the operator to slide the lever without twisting their wrist. The controller often also incorporates a <b>fail-safe</b> <b>device</b> (or dead man's switch) that requires constant downward pressure once the lever is rotated forward from the neutral position. Releasing the lever causes it to pop up on a spring, activating emergency braking.|$|E
5000|$|To descend, a bathyscaphe floods {{air tanks}} with sea water, but unlike a {{submarine}} {{the water in}} the flooded tanks cannot be displaced with compressed air to ascend, because the water pressures at the depths for which the craft was designed to operate are too great. For example, the pressure {{at the bottom of the}} Challenger Deep is more than seven times that in a standard [...] "H-type" [...] compressed gas cylinder. Instead, ballast in the form of iron shot is released to ascend, the shot being lost to the ocean floor. The iron shot containers are in the form of one or more hoppers which are open at the bottom throughout the dive, the iron shot being held in place by an electromagnet at the neck. This is a <b>fail-safe</b> <b>device</b> as it requires no power to ascend; in fact, in the event of a power failure, shot runs out by gravity and ascent is automatic.|$|E
50|$|It was {{determined}} that {{the structure of the}} right horizontal stabiliser failed due to metal fatigue in the rear spar structure, and {{due to the lack of}} an adequate <b>fail-safe</b> structure or <b>device</b> should such an event occur.

40|$|The {{criteria}} for an oxygen <b>fail-safe</b> <b>device</b> arc {{designed to prevent}} a hypoxic gas mixture being administered to the patient should the oxygen supply fail, be disconnected, or be turned off. A <b>fail-safe</b> <b>device</b> which fulfils these criteria is described. Unfortunate accidents in operating theatres and casualty departments have occurred in which the oxygen supply to the anaesthetized patient has failed. In some instances patients have died and in others they have suffered permanent brain damage (Report, 1975). Rosen and Hillard (1971) recommended that a complete fail-safe oxygen alarm system for anaes-thetic apparatus {{should be based on}} the following seven features: (1) It should be operated by the oxygen supply alone. (2) When it is activated: (a) All gas and vapours from the anaesthetic apparatus to the patient should be stopped. (b) The breathing system should be open to the atmosphere. (c) Irrespective of the breathing system in use: (i) the inspired concentration of oxygen should be not less than that concen-tration found in air; (ii) there should be no increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide during either spontaneous breathing or artificial ventilation. (d) It should be impossible to begin the ad-ministration of an anaesthetic unless the initial oxygen supply is of an adequate pressure or unless such a supply is restored after a failure...|$|E
5000|$|An {{electromagnetic}} lock, magnetic lock, or maglock is a {{locking device}} {{that consists of}} an electromagnet and an armature plate. There are two main types of electric locking devices. Locking devices can be either [...] "fail safe" [...] or [...] "fail secure". A fail-secure locking device remains locked when power is lost. <b>Fail-safe</b> locking <b>devices</b> are unlocked when de-energized. Direct pull electromagnetic locks are inherently fail-safe. Typically the electromagnet portion of the lock {{is attached to the}} door frame and a mating armature plate is attached to the door. The two components are in contact when the door is closed. When the electromagnet is energized, a current passing through the electromagnet creates a magnetic flux that causes the armature plate to attract to the electromagnet, creating a locking action. Because the mating area of the electromagnet and armature is relatively large, the force created by the magnetic flux is strong enough to keep the door locked even under stress.|$|R

40|$|Myc is {{activated}} in many tumours, yet, paradoxically, stimulates differentiation in mammalian epidermis. To test whether the epidermis responds differently to {{different levels of}} Myc, we treated K 14 MycER transgenic mice {{with a range of}} concentrations of the inducing agent, 4 -hydroxy-tamoxifen (4 OHT). Proliferation was stimulated at all levels of Myc activity; sebocyte differentiation was stimulated at low and intermediate levels; and interfollicular epidermal differentiation at intermediate and high levels. Mutational inactivation of the Myc p 21 activated kinase 2 (PAK 2) phosphorylation sites increased Myc activity and further enhanced epidermal differentiation. We conclude that Myc induced differentiation acts as a <b>fail-safe</b> <b>device</b> to prevent uncontrolled proliferation and neoplastic conversion of epidermal stem cells expressing high levels of Myc...|$|E

40|$|On July 4, 1997, the Mars Pathfinder {{spacecraft}} {{lands on}} Mars and starts conducting technological and scientific experiments. One experiment, the Alpha-Proton-X-ray Spectrometer, uses a sensor head placed against rocks and soil {{to determine their}} composition. To guarantee proper placement, a deployment mechanism mounted on the Mars Rover aligns the sensor head to within 20 deg of the rock and soil surfaces. In carrying out its task, the mechanism mimics the action of a human hand and arm. Consisting of a flexible wrist, a parallel link arm, a brush dc motor actuator, and a revolutionary non-pyrotechnic <b>fail-safe</b> release <b>device,</b> the mechanism correctly positions the sensor head on rocks as high as 0. 29 m and on targets whose surfaces are tilted as much as 45 deg from the nominal orientation of the sensor head face. The mechanism weighs less than 0. 5 kg, can withstand 100 g's, and requires less than 2. 8 N x m of actuation torque. The fail-safe coupler utilizes Cerrobend, a metal alloy that melts at 60 C, to fuse the actuator {{and the rest of}} the mechanism together.

40|$|This Final Report on the Tidd Hot Gas Clean Up Program {{covers the}} period from initial Proof-of-Concept testing in August, 1990, through final {{equipment}} inspections in May, 1995. The Tidd Hot Gas Clean Up (HGCU) system was installed in the Tidd Pressurized Fluidized Bed Combustion (PFBC) Demonstration Plant, {{which is the first}} utility-scale PFBC plant in the United States. Detailed design work on the project began in July, 1990, and site construction began in December, 1991. Initial operation of the system occurred in May, 1992, and the hot gas filter was commissioned in October, 1992. The test program ended in March, 1995, when the Tidd Plant was shut down following its four-year test program. Section 1. 0 of this report is an executive summary of the project covering the project background, system description, test results and conclusions. Section 2. 0 is an introduction covering the program objectives and schedule. Section 3. 0 provides detailed descriptions of the system and its major components. Section 4. 0 provides detailed results of all testing including observations and posttest inspection results. Sections 5. 0 and 6. 0 list the program conclusions and recommendations, respectively.

40|$|Due to the {{smoothness}} of {{the surfaces}} in surface micromachining, large adhesion forces between fabricated structures and the substrate are encountered. Four major adhesion mechanisms have been analysed: capillary forces, hydrogen bridging, electrostatic forces and van der Waals forces. Once contact is made adhesion forces can be {{stronger than the}} restoring elastic forces and even short, thick beams will continue {{to stick to the}} substrate. Contact, resulting from drying liquid after release etching, has been successfully reduced. In order to make a <b>fail-safe</b> <b>device</b> stiction during its operational life-time should be anticipated. Electrostatic forces and acceleration forces caused by shocks encountered by the device can be large enough to bring structures into contact with the substrate. In order to avoid in-use stiction adhesion forces should therefore be minimized. This is possible by coating the device with weakly adhesive materials, by using bumps and side-wall spacers and by increasing the surface roughness at the interface. Capillary condensation should also be taken into account as this can lead to large increases in the contact area of roughened surfaces...|$|E
