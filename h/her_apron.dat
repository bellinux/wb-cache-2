500|$|Potter sent {{miniature}} {{letters to}} the Moore children, to the Warne children, Lucie Carr and her older sister Kathleen, Master Drew Fayle, and to Master John and Miss Margaret Hough. Seven letters about Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle are extant. Mrs. Josephine Rabbit writes to complain of starch in her handkerchiefs, Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle responds with apologies, Mrs. Rabbit then writes to compliment Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle on the [...] "getting up of the children's muslin frocks" [...] and promises not to seek another laundress. Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle writes Master Fayle warning him that [...] "verything has got all mixed up in wrong bundles" [...] and wondering if he has received Mr. Jeremy Fisher's shirt or Mrs. Flopsy Bunny's apron? Mrs. Bunny writes Master Drew that she is looking for <b>her</b> <b>apron.</b> She has received a shirt marked J.F. that is 3-inches long. Jeremy writes twice to Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle. Once, to complain that he has received an apron marked F.B. and then to complain in a letter dated January 22, 1910:Mr. J. Fisher regrets to have to complain again about the washing. Mrs. T. Winkle has sent home an enormous handkerchief marked 'D. Fayle' instead of the tablecloth marked J.F. If this continues every week, Mr. J. Fisher {{will have to get}} married, so as to have the washing done at home.|$|E
2500|$|Kidd also visited Block Island around 1699, {{where he}} was {{supplied}} by Mrs. Mercy (Sands) Raymond, daughter of the mariner James Sands. The story has it that, for her hospitality, Mrs. Raymond was bid to hold out <b>her</b> <b>apron,</b> into which Kidd threw gold and jewels until it was full. After her husband Joshua Raymond died, Mercy moved with her family to northern New London, Connecticut (later Montville), where she bought much land. The Raymond family was thus {{said to have been}} [...] "enriched by the apron".|$|E
6000|$|... "I left my pore {{wife with}} <b>'er</b> <b>apron</b> over <b>her</b> 'ead sobbing {{as if her}} 'art would break," [...] ses Bob Pretty; [...] "not because o' {{the loss of the}} money so much, but to think of Henery Walker doing such a thing--and 'aving to go to jail for it." ...|$|R
60|$|They 'eard 'im {{talking to}} the landlady at the door, and then 'e went off in a hurry without looking behind 'im, and the landlady {{walked up and down}} on the other side of the road with <b>'er</b> <b>apron</b> stuffed in <b>'er</b> mouth, pretending to be looking at 'er chimney-pots.|$|R
60|$|Miss Vickers {{dropped the}} brush in the pail, and, rising slowly to her feet, stood wiping {{her hands on}} <b>her</b> coarse <b>apron.</b> <b>Her</b> face was red and white in patches, and the captain, {{regarding}} her with growing uneasiness, began to take in sail.|$|R
2500|$|... "having {{dismounted}} {{from his}} horse in an unguarded moment, [...] was espied and {{singled out by}} an old lady of Amazonian proportions, just from the wash tub, who, wiping her hands and mouth on <b>her</b> <b>apron</b> as she approached, seized him around the neck with the hug of a bruin, and bestowed upon him half a dozen kisses that were heard by nearly every man in the command, and when at length she relaxed her hold the Colonel {{looked as if he}} had just come out a vapor bath".|$|E
2500|$|Yet another {{interpretation}} {{sees it as}} an [...] "old-fashioned mourning portrait... Tellingly, {{the curtains}} hanging {{in the windows of}} the house, both upstairs and down, are pulled closed {{in the middle of the}} day, a mourning custom in Victorian America. The woman wears a black dress beneath <b>her</b> <b>apron,</b> and glances away as if holding back tears. One imagines she is grieving for the man beside her..." [...] Wood had been only 10 when his father had died and later had lived for a decade [...] "above a garage reserved for hearses," [...] so death was on his mind.|$|E
2500|$|Contrary to this, Audre Lorde {{was very}} open {{to her own}} {{sexuality}} and sexual awakening. In Zami: A New Spelling of My Name, her famous [...] "biomythography" [...] (a term coined by Lorde that combines [...] "biography" [...] and [...] "mythology") she writes, [...] "Years afterward when I was grown, whenever I thought about the way I smelled that day, I would have a fantasy of my mother, her hands wiped dry from the washing, and <b>her</b> <b>apron</b> untied and laid neatly away, looking down upon me lying on the couch, and then slowly, thoroughly, our touching and caressing each other's most secret places." [...] According to scholar Anh Hua, Lorde turns female abjection—menstruation, female sexuality, and female incest with the mother—into powerful scenes of female relationship and connection, thus subverting patriarchal heterosexist culture.|$|E

5000|$|The postwar archetypal {{housewife}} was {{practical and}} creative. She made aprons out of remnants, extra kitchen curtains, dish towels, handkerchiefs, and flour sacks. When she made <b>her</b> <b>aprons,</b> she considered design {{as well as}} function. Many handmade aprons from the 1950s have one-of-a kind designs and details. Many 1950s aprons addressed housework and were decorated with sewing, cleaning, cooking, and [...] "mom” themes.|$|R

2500|$|Due to the {{location}} of Mitre Square, the City of London Police under Detective Inspector James McWilliam joined the murder enquiry alongside the Metropolitan Police who had been engaged in the previous murders. At about 3 a.m. on the same day as Eddowes was murdered, a blood-stained fragment of <b>her</b> <b>apron</b> contaminated with fecal matter was found lying in the passage of the doorway leading to Flats 108 and 119, Model Dwellings, Goulston Street, Whitechapel. Above it on the wall was a graffito in chalk commonly held to have read: [...] "The Juwes are the men that Will not be Blamed for nothing". The writing {{may or may not have}} been related to the murder, but either way it was washed away before dawn on the orders of Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Charles Warren, who feared that it would spark anti-Jewish riots. Mitre Square had three connecting streets: Church Passage to the north-east, Mitre Street to the south-west, and St James's Place to the north-west. As PC Harvey saw no-one from Church Passage, and PC Watkins saw no-one from Mitre Street, the murderer must have left the square northwards through St James's Place towards Goulston Street. Goulston Street was within a quarter of an hour's walk from Mitre Square, on a direct route to Flower and Dean Street, where Eddowes lived, hinting that her murderer also resided nearby and headed back there after the killing.|$|E
60|$|At last Mr Flintwinch came {{shuffling}} {{down the}} staircase into the hall, muttering and calling 'Affery woman!' all the way. Affery still remaining behind <b>her</b> <b>apron,</b> he came stumbling down the kitchen stairs, candle in hand, sidled up to her, twitched <b>her</b> <b>apron</b> off, and roused her.|$|E
60|$|Mistress Affery, with a {{suppressed}} cry, threw <b>her</b> <b>apron</b> {{over her}} head.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{is a true}} saint! he is {{just about}} to preach,' said the landlady, who had come out with <b>her</b> gayest <b>apron,</b> <b>her</b> whitest cap, and all her gold chains. 'Ah! the poor lady, it would do her heart good to hear him preach; {{and by that time}} the roast would be ready--an admirable piece of venison, sent for the occasion. There he is, the blessed man!' ...|$|R

60|$|Theodosia went on spatting her {{balls of}} golden butter on the print in silence.

She looked as pliable as her butter.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{will be a}} good girl, dear father; indeed I'll be a good girl; at {{any rate}} I'll try. But then--" [...] and she stood up, and {{commenced}} wiping her eyes with <b>her</b> little <b>apron.</b>|$|R
60|$|And mademoiselle, hastily taking from {{a drawer}} a large linen apron, and tying it over <b>her</b> black <b>apron,</b> rushed éperdue into the kitchen, whence, to speak truth, exhaled an odour of {{calcined}} sweets rather strong than savoury.|$|R
60|$|Jeanne's face {{rose from}} <b>her</b> <b>apron</b> like a full moon. She was too astounded to be angry.|$|E
60|$|There was silence. The {{mother sat}} with her hands folded in <b>her</b> <b>apron,</b> her face set, thinking.|$|E
60|$|She dropped <b>her</b> <b>apron,</b> {{replaced}} the cigarette, and, {{with her hands}} on her plump knees, eyes him steadily.|$|E
