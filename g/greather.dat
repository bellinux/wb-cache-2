40|$|Background/Aim. Posterior tibial slope {{is one of}} {{the most}} citated factors wich cause rupture of the {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL). The aim of this study was to determine the association of a <b>greather</b> posterior tibial slope on the lateral condyle, that is a lesser posterior tibial slope on the medial condyle, with ACL rupture. Methods. The patients were divided into two groups. The study group included the patients with chronic instability of the knee besause of a previous rupture of ACL. The control group included the patients with knee lesion, but without ACL rupture. Posterior tibial slope measuring was performed by sagittal MR slices supported by lateral radiograph of the knee. We measured posterior tibial slope on lateral and medial condyles of the tibia. Using these values we calculated an average posterior tibial slope as well as the difference between slopes on lateral and medial condyles. Results. Patients with ACL rupture have highly statistically significantly <b>greather</b> posterior tibial slope (p < 0. 01) on lateral tibial condyle (7. 1 ° : 4. 5 °) as well as statistically significantly lesser posterior tibial slope (p < 0. 05) on medial tibial condyle (5. 0 ° : 6. 6 °) than patients with intact ACL. Conclusion. Great posterior tibial slope on lateral tibial condyle associated with the small posterior tibial slope on the medial tibial condyle, that is a positive differentce between lateral and medial tibial condyles are factors wich may cause ACL rupture...|$|E

40|$|Stochastic impacts {{by large}} bodies are, at present, the usually {{accepted}} mechanisms able {{to account for}} the obliquity of the ice giants. We attempt to set constraints on giant impacts as the cause of Neptune's current obliquity in the framework of modern theories. We also use the present orbital properties of the Neptunian irregular satellites (with the exception of Triton) to set constraints on the scenario of giant impacts at the end of Neptune formation. We model the angular momentum transfer to proto-Neptune and the impulse transfer to its irregular satellites by the last stochastic collision (GC) between the protoplanet and an oligarchic mass at the end of Neptune's formation. We obtain that an impactor mass <b>greather</b> than 4 Earth masses is not possible since it cannot reproduce the present rotational properties of the planet, unless the impact parameter of the collision were very small. On the other hand, if the impactor mass was <b>greather</b> than 1. 4 Earth masses, the present Neptunian irregular satellites had to be formed or captured after the end of stochastic impacts. The upper bounds on the oligarchic masses (4 Earth masses from the obliquity of Neptune and 1. 4 earth masses from the Neptunian irregular satellites) are independent of unknown parameters, such as the mass and distribution of the planetesimals, the location at which Uranus and Neptune were formed, the Solar Nebula initial surface mass density, and the growth regime. If stochastic impacts had occurred, these results should be understood as upper constraints on the oligarchic masses in the trans-Saturnian region at the end of ice planet formation and may be used to set constraints on planetary formation scenarios.

40|$|This work investigates pattern {{recognition}} tech-niques {{that can be}} used to identify the author of fine art paintings based on the content of their digitized images. The methodology proposed consists of four sequential phases: image acquisition, segmentation, feature extrac-tion, and classification. For segmenting brushstrokes it is assumed that the hue is quite uniform in a single brush-stroke. The work uses a wavelet-based technique to measure textures and uses it as a feature to describe the brushstrokes in the painting. Classification is performed through two distinct non-parametric algorithms: Fuzzy KNN and Kohonen Map. A system was built in order to evaluate the proposed approach in the task of discriminat-ing between two different painters.
