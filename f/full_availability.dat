500|$|Numerary assistants are {{a type of}} numerary {{that exists}} in the Women's Branch of Opus Dei. Their <b>full</b> <b>availability</b> for the Prelature is lived out as <b>full</b> <b>availability</b> for doing a {{specific}} type of work, namely looking after the domestic needs of the conference centers and the residential centers of Opus Dei.

[...] Any heavy maintenance is performed overnight. [...] track access charges were capped at approximate £71.35 per minute. [...] In 2008 the cost of running a train along the full length of the line between St Pancras and the Channel Tunnel was £2,244; with lower costs of £2,192 for a domestic service to Ashford International, or £1,044 for St Pancras to Ebbsfleet International.

500|$|Numeraries, {{the second}} largest type of the {{faithful}} of Opus Dei, comprise about 20% of total membership. Numeraries are celibate members who give themselves in [...] "full availability" [...] (plena disponibilitas) for the official undertakings of the Prelature. [...] This includes <b>full</b> <b>availability</b> for giving doctrinal and ascetical formation to other members, for staffing the internal government of Opus Dei if asked by the regional directors, and for moving to other countries to start or help with apostolic activities if asked by the Prelate. [...] Because they are making themselves fully available to do whatever {{needs to be done}} for the undertakings of the Prelature, numeraries are expected to live in special centers run by Opus Dei, and the question of which particular center a numerary will live in depends upon the regional needs. [...] "" [...] is a general term for persons who form part of the permanent staff of an organization. Therefore in order to maintain a family atmosphere in the centers (rather than an institutional one), it is considered very important for numeraries to participate in daily meals and [...] "get-togethers" [...] in which they converse and share news. [...] Both men and women may become numeraries in Opus Dei, although the centers are strictly gender-segregated. Numeraries generally have jobs outside of Opus Dei, although some are asked to work internally full-time and many modify the way that they go about their professional goals in order to be available for the Prelature. They devote the bulk of their income to the organization.|$|E

40|$|It is {{generally}} {{believed that the}} number of citations to an article can positively be correlated to its free online availability. In the present study, we investigated the possible impact of academic social networks on the number of citations. We chose the social web service “ResearchGate” as a case. This website acts both as a social network to connect researchers, and at the same time, as an open access repository to publish post-print version of the accepted manuscripts and final versions of open access articles. We collected the data of 1823 articles published by the authors from four different universities. By analyzing these data, we showed that although different levels of <b>full</b> text <b>availability</b> are observed for the four universities, there is always a significant positive correlation between <b>full</b> text <b>availability</b> and the citation count. Moreover, we showed that both post-print version and publisher’s version (i. e., final published version) of the archived manuscripts receive more citations than non-OA articles, and the difference in the citation counts of post-print manuscripts and publisher’s version articles is nonsignificant...|$|R
