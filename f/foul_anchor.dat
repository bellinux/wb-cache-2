2500|$|The Corps of Royal Marines has {{a single}} pattern Queen's Colour, which is the Union Flag with the <b>foul</b> <b>anchor</b> and the reigning sovereign's cypher {{interlaced}} in the centre. Above is a scroll with the single battle honour Gibraltar surmounted by St Edward's Crown. Below is the globe (which represents the many Battle Honours the Royal Marines had earned) surrounded by a laurel wreath (which represents the Battle of Belle Isle) and below this is a scroll with the Corps' motto. Each of the four commandos (the battalion-sized formations {{that make up the}} bulk of the corps) has a Queen's Colour, with the only difference being the colour of the cords and tassels. Each commando also has its own Regimental Colour. The Regimental Colour is a dark blue flag (because the Corps is classed as a 'royal regiment') with a small Union Flag at the pike head. The Colour carries similar central embellishments as the Queen's Colour, with the exception that the cypher of George IV replaces that of the reigning monarch and the unit numeral is below. The Royal Cypher is at the other corners. The Regimental Colours also have the coloured cords and tassels, which are gold combined with the following colours: ...|$|E

"There {{is not a}} {{smoother}} bore, nor a wider mouth, in the ship, your Honour, than these of 'Blazing Billy,'" [...] returned the topman, giving {{the subject of his}} commendations an affectionate slap. [...] "All I ask is a clean spunge and a tight wad. Guinea score a <b>foul</b> <b>anchor,</b> in your own fashion, on a half dozen of the shot; and, after the matter is all over, they who live through it may go aboard the enemy, and see in what manner Richard Fid has planted his seed." ...|$|E
6000|$|For {{the anchor}} [...] "to go clear" [...] means to go clear {{of its own}} chain. Your anchor must drop from the bow of your ship with no turn of cable on any of its limbs, else you would be riding to a <b>foul</b> <b>anchor.</b> Unless {{the pull of the}} cable is fair on the ring, no anchor can be trusted even on the best of holding ground. In time of stress it is bound to drag, for {{implements}} and men must be treated fairly to give you the [...] "virtue" [...] which is in them. The anchor is an emblem of hope, but a <b>foul</b> <b>anchor</b> is worse than the most fallacious of false hopes that ever lured men or nations into a sense of security. And the sense of security, even the most warranted, is a bad councillor. It is the sense which, like that exaggerated feeling of well-being ominous of the coming on of madness, precedes the swift fall of disaster. A seaman labouring under an undue sense of security becomes at once worth hardly half his salt. Therefore, of all my chief officers, the one I trusted most was a man called B-. He had a red moustache, a lean face, also red, and an uneasy eye. He was worth all his salt.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the winter}} and summer working uniform shirt, a {{freshman}} (Midshipman Fourth Class or [...] "plebe") wears no collar insignia, a [...] (Midshipman Third Class or [...] "Youngster") wears a single <b>fouled</b> <b>anchor</b> on the right collar point, a Junior (Midshipman Second Class) <b>fouled</b> <b>anchors</b> on each collar point, and a Senior (Midshipman First Class or [...] "Firstie") wears <b>fouled</b> <b>anchors</b> with perched eagles. First class midshipmen in officer billets replace those devices with their respective midshipman officer collar insignia.|$|R

That's what they really were, you see--charcoal. They fell to bits when we tried to shift 'em. The man who was standin' up had the false teeth. I saw 'em shinin' against the black. Fell to bits he did too, like his mate squatting down an' watchin' him, both of 'em all wet in the rain. Both burned to charcoal, you see. And--that's what made me ask about marks just now--the false-toother was tattooed on the arms and chest--a crown and <b>foul</b> <b>anchor</b> with M.V. above." ...|$|E
60|$|During {{the greater}} part of the watch, the sailors sat on the {{windlass}} and told long stories of their adventures by sea and land, and talked about Gibraltar, and Canton, and Valparaiso, and Bombay, just as you and I would about Peck Slip and the Bowery. Every man of them almost was a volume of Voyages and Travels round the World. And what most struck me was that like books of voyages they often contradicted each other, and would fall into long and violent disputes about who was keeping the <b>Foul</b> <b>Anchor</b> tavern in Portsmouth at such a time; or whether the King of Canton lived or did not live in Persia; or whether the bar-maid of a particular house in Hamburg had black eyes or blue eyes; with many other mooted points of that sort.|$|E
60|$|Tremont, Boston, June 16th.--Tremendously {{hot weather}} to-day. Went {{on board the}} Cyane to see Bridge, the purser. Took boat {{from the end of}} Long Wharf; with two boatmen who had just landed a man. Row round to the {{starboard}} side of the sloop, where we pass up the steps, and are received by Bridge, who introduces us to one of the lieutenants,--Hazard. Sailors and midshipmen scattered about,--the middies having a <b>foul</b> <b>anchor,</b> that is, an anchor with a cable twisted round it, embroidered on the collars of their jackets. The officers generally wear blue jackets with lace on the shoulders, white pantaloons, and cloth caps. Introduced into the cabin,--a handsome room, finished with mahogany, comprehending the width of the vessel; a sideboard with liquors, and above it a looking-glass; behind the cabin, an inner room, in which is seated a lady, waiting for the captain to come on board; on each side of this inner cabin, a large and convenient state-room with bed,--the doors opening into the cabin. This cabin is on a level with the quarter-deck, and is covered by the poop-deck. Going down below stairs, you come to the ward-room, a pretty large room, round which are the state-rooms of the lieutenants, the purser, surgeon, etc. A stationary table. The ship's main-mast comes down through the middle of the room, and Bridge's chair, at dinner, is planted against it. Wine and brandy produced; and Bridge calls to the Doctor to drink with him, who answers affirmatively from his state-room, and shortly after opens the door and makes his appearance. Other officers emerge {{from the side of the}} vessel, or disappear into it, in the same way. Forward of the ward-room, adjoining it, and on the same level, is the midshipmen's room, on the larboard side of the vessel, not partitioned off, so as to be shut up. On a shelf a few books; one midshipman politely invites us to walk in; another sits writing. Going farther forward, on the same level we come to the crew's department, part of which is occupied by the cooking-establishment, where all sorts of cooking is going on for the officers and men.|$|E

50|$|Epaulettes of the {{military}} branch were gold throughout with silver devices, while those of the civil branches had a silver edging and gold devices. Instead of the baton and sword or <b>foul</b> <b>anchor,</b> civil branch epaulettes substituted a star. Navigating branch epaulettes {{were the same as}} {{the military}} branch, but with crossed plain anchors in place of the <b>foul</b> <b>anchor.</b> The epaulette stars had eight points, quite unlike the Order of the Bath stars worn by army officers.|$|E

50|$|The {{midshipman}} uniforms {{followed the}} CS Navy uniform regulations issued after 1862, requiring the uniform to be steel grey in color, lined with dark black silk serge. The jackets were coarse gray cloth material, {{and made of}} wool. The sleeves of midshipmen, like all officers, had three sleeve buttons mounted vertically. In lieu of stripe, mishipman had three small buttons with <b>fouled</b> <b>anchors,</b> and passed midshipmen had three large buttons with <b>fouled</b> <b>anchors</b> mounted horizontally. A midshipman had no shoulder strap, while a passed midshipman had a strip of gold lace four inches long and half an inch wide. The covers of both ranks of midshipman were also steel gray and contained only a horizontal gold officers band with a <b>fouled</b> <b>anchor,</b> and a black leather visor.|$|R

50|$|Licensed {{officers}} of the U.S. Merchant Marine may wear shoulder marks and sleeve stripes appropriate to their rank and branch of service. Deck officers wear a <b>foul</b> <b>anchor</b> above the stripes on their shoulder marks and engineering officers wear a three-bladed propeller. In the U.S. Merchant Marine, the correct wear of shoulder marks depicting the fouled anchor is with the un-fouled stock of the anchor forward on the wearer.|$|E

50|$|In 1776, {{the device}} {{consisted}} of a <b>fouled</b> <b>anchor</b> (tangled in its rope) of silver or pewter. Changes were made in 1798, 1821, and 1824. In 1834, it was prescribed that a brass eagle be worn on the cover, the eagle to measure 3.5 in from wingtip to wingtip. An eagle clutching a <b>fouled</b> <b>anchor</b> with thirteen six-pointed stars above was used on uniform buttons starting in 1804. This same insignia is used today on the buttons of Marine dress and service uniforms, with the six-pointed stars changed to five-pointed stars.|$|R
5000|$|NROTC {{students}} are generally issued {{several types of}} uniforms, all for them to keep.

It is senior to able seaman but junior to petty officer.
