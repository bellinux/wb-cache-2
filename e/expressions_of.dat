This study was carried out to assess the {{association}} <b>of</b> abnormal <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> miR- 155 in peripheral blood of patients with Rheumatoid arthritis with the <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> TNF-α and IL- 1 β. Release of TNF-α and IL- 1 β, and <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> miR- 155 were determined in RA peripheral blood or peripheral blood macrophages, followed by correlation analysis of the cytokines release and miR- 155 expression. Furthermore, in vitro studies indicate that miR- 155 inhibited the <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> SOCS 1. Our results suggest that there is a correlation between the high-level <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> miR- 155 and the enhanced <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> TNF-α and IL- 1 β. miR- 155 targets and suppresses the <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> SOCS 1, and the decrease of SOCS 1 may lead to the upregulation of TNF-α and IL- 1 β...|$|R

By means <b>of</b> immunohistochemistry, the <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> E-cadherin and alpha- and beta-catenin was studied in 65 oesophageal adenocarcinomas and 15 lymph node metastases. <b>Expression</b> <b>of</b> these proteins was evaluated with respect to clinico-pathological parameters and patient survival. <b>Expression</b> <b>of</b> the proteins was strongly correlated. In carcinomas, reduced <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> E-cadherin, alpha-catenin, and beta-catenin was found in 74, 60, and 72 per cent, respectively. <b>Expression</b> <b>of</b> E-cadherin and alpha-catenin correlated significantly with stage and grade of the carcinomas, whereas <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> beta-catenin correlated only with grade.

40|$|Immediate-early {{genes of}} the fos and jun {{families}} encode proteins that dimerize {{to form a}} complex of activator protein 1 and regulate the <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> a number of genes in the nervous system. Ethanol has previously been shown to induce alterations in <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> fos and jun genes in the brain. The present study {{examined the effects of}} ethanol on the <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> c-fos, fosB, c-jun, junB and junD genes in human neuroblastoma SH-SY 5 Y cells. Prior to the investigation of ethanol effects, the basal and agonist-stimulated <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> these genes were characterized. A constitutive <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> c-jun and junD was observed in unstimulated cells, whereas transcripts of c-fos, fosB and junB could not be detected. Stimulation with carbachol and TPA induced <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> all these genes but the expression patterns differed among individual genes. The <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> c-fos, fosB and junB induced by carbachol was primarily mediated through protein kinase C, whereas the carbachol-stimulated <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> c-jun and junD was mainly regulated via calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II. Long-term ethanol exposure increased the <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> c-jun and junD and potentiated the carbachol-stimulated <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> c-fos, fosB and junB. On the other hand, acute ethanol selectively attenuated the basal and phorbol ester-stimulated <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> junD, leaving the <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> c-jun and junB unaffected. Thus, junD seems to be sensitive to both acute and long-term ethanol exposure. The potentiation of carbachol-stimulated c-fos, fosB and junB expression after long-term ethanol exposure was primarily mediated via M 1 receptors and protein kinase C. Neither long-term nor acute ethanol exposure influenced the degradation of the junD mRNA, which indicates that it is the transcription of the gene which is affected by ethanol. These results support the view that <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> fos and jun genes is involved in the ethanol-induced changes in the function of nerve cells...|$|R

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the genetic circuitry underlying the determination of neuronal identity, using mammalian peripheral autonomic neurons as a model system. Previously, we showed that treatment of neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) with bone morphogenetic protein- 2 (BMP- 2) leads to an induction <b>of</b> MASH 1 <b>expression</b> and consequent autonomic neuronal differentiation. We now show that BMP 2 also induces <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> the paired homeodomain transcription factor Phox 2 a, and the GDNF/NTN signalling receptor tyrosine kinase c-RET. Constitutive <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> MASH 1 in NCSCs from a retroviral vector, {{in the absence of}} exogenous BMP 2, induces <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> both Phox 2 a and c-RET in a large fraction of infected colonies, and also promotes morphological neuronal differentiation and <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> pan-neuronal markers. In vivo, <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> Phox 2 a in autonomic ganglia is strongly reduced in Mash 1 -/- embryos. These loss- and gain-of-function data suggest that MASH 1 positively regulates <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> Phox 2 a, either directly or indirectly. Constitutive <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> Phox 2 a, by contrast to MASH 1, fails to induce <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> neuronal markers or a neuronal morphology, but does induce <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> c-RET.

5|$|Historian Nancy Rabinowitz {{argues that}} ancient Greek red vase images portraying women {{with their arms}} around another woman's waist, or leaning on a woman's {{shoulders}} can be construed as <b>expressions</b> <b>of</b> romantic desire.

Although men participated in pederastic relationships outside marriage, there is no clear evidence that women were allowed or encouraged to have same-sex relationships before or during marriage as long as their marital obligations were met. Women who appear on Greek pottery are depicted with affection, and in instances where women appear only with other women, their images are eroticized: bathing, touching one another, with dildos placed in and around such scenes, and sometimes with imagery also seen in depictions of heterosexual marriage or pederastic seduction. Whether this eroticism is for the viewer or an accurate representation of life is unknown.|$|E

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that especially spontaneous <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> NF-KB is associated with spontaneous cytokine expression. However, the spontaneous <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> transcription factors is not due to the endogenous secretion of IL- 1 since the addition of anti-IL- 1 monoclonal antibody did not affect the <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> NF-KB.
