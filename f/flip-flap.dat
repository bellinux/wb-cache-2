I did not witness this performance, I am sorry to say, but I have seen him do somersaults and turn cart-wheels in the door-yard just from the pure joy of living.

60|$|You figure her, I hope, {{with her}} white bundle, {{a sort of}} erect black ant, hurrying along the little white path-thread athwart the downland slopes under the {{hot sun of the}} summer afternoon. On she {{struggled}} after her resolute indefatigable nose, and the poppies in her bonnet quivered perpetually and her spring-side boots grew whiter and whiter with the downland dust. <b>Flip-flap,</b> <b>flip-flap</b> went her footfalls through the still heat of the day, and persistently, incurably, her umbrella sought to slip from under the elbow that retained it. The mouth wrinkle under her nose was pursed to an extreme resolution, and ever and again she told her umbrella to come up or gave her tightly clutched bundle a vindictive jerk. And at times her lips mumbled with fragments of some foreseen argument between herself and Skinner.|$|E

60|$|They sat, flower-garlanded, in the perfumed, {{luminous}} night, {{and their}} lips made uncouth noises and their throats rasped approval of Koolau's speech. They were creatures who {{once had been}} men and women. But they were men and women no longer. They were monsters--in face and form grotesque caricatures of everything human. They were hideously maimed and distorted, and had the seeming of creatures that had been racked in millenniums of hell. Their hands, when they possessed them, were like harpy claws. Their faces were the misfits and slips, crushed and bruised by some mad god at play in the machinery of life. Here and there were features which the mad god had smeared half away, and one woman wept scalding tears from twin pits of horror, where her eyes once had been. Some were in pain and groaned from their chests. Others coughed, making sounds like the tearing of tissue. Two were idiots, more like huge apes marred in the making, until even an ape were an angel. They mowed and gibbered in the moonlight, under crowns of drooping, golden blossoms. One, whose bloated ear-lobe flapped like a fan upon his shoulder, caught up a gorgeous flower of orange and scarlet and with it decorated the monstrous ear that <b>flip-flapped</b> with his every movement.|$|R

60|$|In {{the first}} swelter {{room of the}} new Osmanli Baths in Cork Street four or five {{recumbent}} individuals, {{in a state of}} moist nudity and self-respecting inertia, were smoking cigarettes or making occasional pretence of reading damp newspapers. A glass wall with a glass door shut them off from the yet more torrid regions of the further swelter chambers; another glass partition disclosed the dimly-lit vault where other patrons of the establishment had arrived at the stage of being pounded and kneaded and sluiced by Oriental-looking attendants. The splashing and trickling of taps, the <b>flip-flap</b> of wet slippers on a wet floor, and the low murmur of conversation, filtered through glass doors, made an appropriately drowsy accompaniment to the scene.|$|E

The snow was crisp and hard; their worn and {{hardened}} feet made but the faintest <b>flip-flap</b> in the hush. And scarcely had they run their first short wind out, when lo and behold! there, in a leafy bower of snow in their path, three short-maned snorting little Horses of Tishnar, or Zevveras, stood, rearing and chafing, and yet it seemed tethered invisibly to that same frosty stable by a bridle from which they could not break away.|$|E

5000|$|The Flip flap (also {{known as}} the elastico, [...] "Snakebite" [...] and la culebrita) is a {{dribbling}} move, or feint, in football, used to fool a defensive player into thinking the offensive player, in possession of the ball, {{is going to move}} in a direction they are not intending. Players perform it by using the outside of their dominant foot to push the ball towards their dominant side, then quickly move the dominant foot around the ball and using the inside to push the ball to their non-dominant side. Although the footwork is the most distinctive aspect of the <b>flip-flap,</b> its success as a feint also relies heavily on the attacking player having an explosive acceleration from a stationary position.|$|E
40|$|Background: Laparoscopic Hernia Repair Is Especially Advantageous For Bilateral Or Recurrent Diseases In Children Because It Avoids Vas Injury. However, It Is More Technically Demanding, And The Recurrent Rate Has Been Higher Than With The Open Method. The Authors Developed A Method Of Laparoscopic Hernia Repair That Is Easy And Secure. Methods: The Hernia Opening Was Repaired With A Peritoneal <b>Flip-Flap</b> Anchored With A Single Tension-Free Intracorporeal Suture. The Vas And Testicular Vessel Were Completely Untouched. The Valve Mechanism Of The <b>Flip-Flap</b> Helped To Avoid Scrotal Collection And Prevent Hernia Recurrence. Results. In 32 Patients Ages 1 Month To 17 Years 43 Repairs Were Performed. The Early Result Was Promising, And No Recurrence Was Noticed In A Median Follow-Up Period Of 4 Months. Conclusions: Laparoscopic <b>Flip-Flap</b> Hernioplasty Is Easy To Perform And Has A Number Of Theoretical Advantages, Although The Long-Term Result Still Needs To Be Evaluated. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives: Inguinal {{hernia repair}} {{is one of}} the most {{frequently}} performed pediatric surgical operations. Several pediatric laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair techniques have been introduced. But debate is unresolved regarding the feasibility of laparoscopy for treating pediatric inguinal hernias. Methods: A retrospective cohort study enrolled 33 patients who underwent congenital inguinal hernia repair by either the new laparoscopic <b>flip-flap</b> technique or conventional open repair. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to the type of surgery: Group A included those who underwent the new laparoscopic technique, and Group B included those who underwent conventional open repair. Results: Group A comprised 15 patients (mean age, 39 months), and group B comprised 18 (mean age, 44 months). Mean operative time was 47. 5 minutes for Group A versus 27. 5 minutes for Group B. Intraoperative complications for Group A included 1 case (7 %) of vas deferens injury, and 3 cases (20 %) in which the flaps were torn during suturing. In Group B, no intraoperative complications were encountered. In both groups, the mean postoperative hospital stay was 5. 5 hours. Postoperative follow-up of 3 months revealed recurrence in 4 patients in Group A (27 %), while there were no recurrences in Group B. Conclusion: Our preliminary experience shows unsatisfactory outcomes with laparoscopic <b>flip-flap</b> hernia repair in children. In spite of advancement in the application of laparoscopy in pediatric surgery, conventional open hernia repair is still the gold standard for children, in our experience. Future studies with more numbers and longterm follow-up should be conducted...|$|E
40|$|Context: Despite the {{abundance}} of techniques for the repair of Hypospadias, its problems still persist and a satisfactory design to correct the penile curvature {{with the formation of}} neourethra from the native urethral tissue or genital or extragenital tissues, with minimal postoperative complications has yet to evolve. Aim: Persisting with such an endeavor, a new technique for the repair of distal and midpenile hypospadias is described. Materials and Methods: The study has been done in 70 cases over the past 11 years. The "Forked-Flap" repair is a single stage method for the repair of such Hypospadias with chordee. It takes advantage of the rich vascular communication at the corona and capitalizes on the established reliability of the meatal based <b>flip-flap.</b> The repair achieves straightening of the curvature of the penis by complete excision of chordee tissue from the ventral surface of the penis beneath the urethral plate. The urethra is reconstructed using the native plate with forked flap extensions and genital tissue relying on the concept of meatal based flaps. Water proofing by dartos tissue and reinforcement by Nesbitâ²s prepucial tissue transfer completes the one stage procedure. Statistical Analysis: An analysis of 70 cases of this single stage technique of repair of penile hypospadias with chordee, operated at 3 to 5 years of age over the past 11 years is presented. Results and Conclusion: The Forked Flap gives comparable and replicable results; except for a urethrocutaneous fistula rate of 4 % no other complications were observed...|$|E
40|$|For LNG {{transfer}} in ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore configurations emergency release couplings (F. RC) {{in combination with}} loading arms and multi-composite hoses are applied In view of a demand for increasing transfer flow rates in offshore LNG applications a 10 -inch ERC has been developed intended for LNG transfer flow rates up to 2250 m 3 lhr This paper describes the results of ambient water flow tests and release of the ERC in combination with a multi-composite hose If a standard instant closure ERC is activated it will stop any flow almost instantaneously due to fast closing of spring- operated butterfly valves, and will separate to disconnect the upstream and downstream transfer system. Due to fast closing of the ERC pressure surges will occur both in the upstream hose and downstream piping KLAW has developed a new model, whereby {{there is also a}} controlled closure valve (CCV) system incorporated in the emergency release coupling to reduce pressure surge amplitude by reducing the flow rate before Instantaneous' <b>flip-flap</b> valve closure. The test results show the impact of variation of flow rates and valve closure times on the amplitude of pressure surges, the spill rate and the mechanical integrity. The hose flexibility contributes to the damping of pressure surge amplitude, resulting shock load and high acceleration levels on the upstream piping The results of the test described contribute to the qualification of the ERC by Bureau Veritas and may contribute to further modelling and prediction of the impact of ERC release in actual applications...|$|E
40|$|AimThe aim of {{the study}} is to present views of {{pediatric}} surgeons on the optimal approach to inguinal hernias in children. MethodsA questionnaire was submitted to participants of EUPSA-BAPS 2012 and it was returned by 187 responders (85 % senior surgeons) from 46 (27 European) countries. Main ResultsApproximately 80 % of the responders work in centers treating more than 100 cases/year. Approximately 79 % of the responders routinely perform laparoscopy for other conditions, but of these, only 22 % of the responders routinely perform laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. Open approach is preferred by 83 % of the responders. Of these, 79 % of the responders favor unilateral approach, 12 % of the responders contralateral, and 9 % of the responders contralateral laparoscopic exploration via hernial sac. Considered advantages are the less risk of recurrence (66 %), less abdominal organ injury (31 %), less vas/vessel injury (25 %), and speed (16 %). Laparoscopic approach is preferred by 17 % of the respondents, of whom 58 % perform laparoscopy at all ages, 15 % only in younger than 1 -year-old infants. Approximately 81 % of the responders offer laparoscopy to both sexes, and 17 % only in girls. Only 15 % would do laparoscopy after incarceration. Purse string is the most popular (58 %), then laparoscopic-guided percutaneous closure (28 %), <b>flip-flap</b> (6 %), or other techniques (8 %). Proficiency is achieved after 50 (14 %), 25 (48 %), 10 (32 %), or 5 (6 %) laparoscopic hernia repairs. Considered advantages are less metachronous contralateral hernias (57 %), better cosmesis (41 %), easier technique (34 %), less vas/vessel injury (31 %), and less postoperative pain (22 %). A total of 50 responders are planning to start laparoscopic hernia repairs. ConclusionsMost pediatric surgeons favor open unilateral inguinal hernia repair. The role of laparoscopy in inguinal hernias is still controversial and yet to be accepted even amongst pediatric surgeons expert in laparoscopy...|$|E
