40|$|Climatic {{changes are}} {{projected}} to alter the abundance, dynamics, and geographical distribution of many vector-borne diseases in human populations. Tick-borne diseases such as Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) are a growing concern in northern Europe and the United States. The impact of a future climate change on the transmission of tick-borne diseases is not known. To make such assumptions, more empirical data are needed on the relations between short-term fluctuations in contemporary weather and disease incidence. This paper analyzes relations between <b>daily</b> <b>minimum</b> and maximum <b>temperatures,</b> monthly precipitation, and TBE incidence during a 36 -yr period in Stockholm County, a high-endemic region for TBE in Sweden. Multiple regression analyses were performed, with temperature variables expressed as number of days per winter or spring - summer - fall season with temperatures above, below, or in the interval between different temperature limits. The limits used for <b>daily</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>temperatures</b> represent bioclimatic thresholds of importance for pathogen transmission. To adjust {{for the length of}} the tick&# 039;s life cycle, each TBE incidence rate was related to meteorological data over two consecutive years. Results reveal that increased incidence of tick-borne encephalitis is related to a combination of two successive years of more days with temperatures permitting prolonged seasonal tick activity and, hence, pathogen transmission (i. e., <b>daily</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>temperatures</b> above 5 ºC- 10 ºC), and a mild winter preceding the year before the incidence year (i. e., fewer winter days with <b>minimum</b> <b>temperatures</b> below - 7 ºC). Alternative explanations of the results are discussed. Findings {{of this study suggest that}} a climate change may extend the seasonal range and intensify the endemicity of tick-borne diseases, in particular, at northern latitudes...|$|R

40|$|Daily {{variations}} of air temperature {{in summer and}} winter around the Ise Bay are examined by use of AMEDAS temperature data in Aichi, Gifu, Mie and Shiga Prefectures during 1979 – 2001. In this study, temperature data in consideration of adiabatic cooling are used, corrected sea level data by mean temperature lapse rate (0. 0065 Km- 1). From <b>daily</b> maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>temperature</b> distributions in summer and winter, daily maximum temperatures are high in both seasons northeast off the Nobi Plain and <b>daily</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>temperatures</b> are low. Around the bay mouth of the Ise Bay, daily maximum temperatures are low in summer and <b>daily</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>temperatures</b> are high in summer and winter. To see the daily temperature variations in summer and winter, hourly mean temperature data are calculated. At several stations, the hours to be highest temperature {{are different from those}} at other stations in summer. To divide the stations into similar groups, cluster analysis is examined using both summer-time mean by maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>temperature</b> data and winter-time mean by maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>temperature</b> data. As a result, all of the stations were classified into several characteristic groups: the group affected by the open ocean, the group located at a high altitude, the group affected by the urbanization and so on. Daily temperature variation is small around the bay mouth of the Ise Bay. On the contrary, daily temperature variation is large northeast off the Nobi Plain. The urbanized area in the Nobi Plain is significantly warmer than the rural part of the Nobi Plain from 17 to 24. In conclusion, the characteristic daily temperature variations are found in the area around the Ise Bay 1979 年から 2000 年の伊勢湾周辺域である愛知，岐阜，三重，滋賀県のアメダスデータを用いて，夏季，冬季における伊勢湾周辺域の気温の日変動について調べた。気温は気圧の減少に伴い低下するため，気温の平均高度減率（ 0. 0065 Km- 1 ）で補正した。夏季，冬季の日最高気温，日最低気温の空間分布から，夏冬とも濃尾平野北東の高地で日最高気温が高く，日最低気温は低かった。伊勢湾湾口付近では夏の日最高気温が低く，夏冬ともに日最低気温は高かった。夏季，冬季の時間平均気温から，夏に最高気温を示す時間帯で地点によって気温変動に違いが見られた。類似したグループに分けるために，夏冬の日最高最低気温と日平均気温を用いてクラスター解析を行った。結果として，外洋の影響を受けている地域，高地の特徴を持つ地域，都市化の影響を受けている地域などの特徴的なグループに分けることができた。伊勢湾口付近の観測点では 1 日の気温変化が小さかったが，濃尾平野北東の高地では 1 日の気温変動が大きい。濃尾平野都市部は周辺の都市化が進んでいないグループより 17 ～ 24 時付近の気温が高かった。結果として，伊勢湾周辺域で特徴的な気温の日変動を示すことができた...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2004 A {{case study}} was {{performed}} in 2000 and 2001 to characterize the thermal pattern of four morphologically similar eastern Oregon streams and to identify the physical and environmental factors that expressed significant and functionally viable relationships with stream <b>temperature</b> (<b>daily</b> maximum, <b>daily</b> <b>minimum</b> and <b>daily</b> rate of heating). Stream and environmental attributes were measured at various locations along each stream to provide a data set comprised of variables representing <b>daily</b> stream <b>temperatures</b> (<b>minimum,</b> maximum and rates of heating), <b>daily</b> air <b>temperatures</b> (<b>minimum</b> and maximum), shade, elevation, elevation change and length. Data from the 20 hottest days were analyzed using analysis of variance and regression-based path analysis. With the exception of those reaches that were influenced by groundwater or subsurface flow, downstream reaches consistently experienced increases in the daily maximum stream temperature. The most significant parameter with respect to daily maximum stream temperature appeared to be reach elevation; expressed through reach location in the watershed. Maximum air temperature also positively influenced maximum stream temperature however, only on streams that expressed significant variation in maximum air temperature. The dominant influence of groundwater on maximum stream temperature was also apparent. Significant reach level variation in <b>daily</b> <b>minimum</b> stream <b>temperatures</b> was not observed in this study, however most streams did record increases in the downstream direction. <b>Daily</b> <b>minimum</b> air <b>temperature</b> was consistent across all streams in expressing the most significant relationship with <b>daily</b> <b>minimum</b> stream <b>temperature.</b> With the exception of groundwater influenced reaches, all streams exhibited obvious downstream increases in the daily rate of stream heating. <b>Daily</b> <b>minimum</b> air <b>temperature</b> consistently exhibited a significant negative association with the rate of heating and a relationship was also implied between reach elevation, maximum stream <b>temperature</b> and <b>minimum</b> stream <b>temperature</b> and this stream temperature response.
