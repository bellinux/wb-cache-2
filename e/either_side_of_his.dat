5|$|Though Cleeve was by {{no means}} a wealthy house, the monks were able to make {{significant}} investment in remodelling their home so as to match the rising living standards of the later mediaeval period. In the fourteenth-century elaborate polychrome tiled floors (an expensive and high status product) were laid throughout the abbey and in the mid-fifteenth century radical works were undertaken. A wooden shelter was constructed over the tiled floor in 2016. Abbot David Juyner (r.1435–87) commissioned a complete redesign of the south range of the monastery. He demolished the old refectory and built a new one parallel to the cloister on the first floor. This grand chamber with its wooden vaulted ceiling (carved with angels) was the equal of the hall of any contemporary secular lord. Beneath it he built several self-contained apartments. These were probably used by corrodians, pensioners of the abbey. Juyner may also have been responsible for decorating the abbey with wall paintings of religious and allegorical subjects. Some of these wall paintings survive. As well as one depicting the Crucifixion, there is an arrangement of St Catherine and St Margaret on either side of, and facing, a man standing on a bridge: the bridge is over water full of fish, and the man has an angel on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> head, and is being attacked by a lion to his left on the bridge, and a dragon to his right. Work continued under Juyner's successors to the eve of the Dissolution. The last building work to be completed was the remodelling of the gatehouse, performed after 1510, though as late as 1534 the monks were engaged in a major project of renewing the cloister walks in the latest fashion. As at the neighbouring house of Forde Abbey, this was never completed, due to the dissolution of the abbey.|$|E
25|$|Bartman {{has said}} he managed to escape after he faked an asthma attack while he was being untied from the tree. He then ran back through the bush and swam across the river. Boland said the two Tomkins then walked into the {{farmhouse}} and returned with a double-barrelled shotgun and 0.22-calibre rifle, loaded both in front of Boland and pressed the guns to <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> temples, yelled racist taunts and hammered the boy's face with their gun butts. The Tomkins called the police and allegedly removed the noose from Boland's neck before they arrived. The police took Boland to Goondiwindi police station and charged him with break and enter.|$|E
500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of August 16, the weather cleared, and Stark ordered his men {{to be ready to}} attack. Stark is reputed to have rallied his troops by saying they were here to fight for their [...] "natural born rights as Englishmen" [...] and he added [...] "There are your enemies, the Red Coats and the Tories. They are ours, or this night Molly Stark sleeps a widow." [...] Upon hearing that the militia had melted away into the woods, Baum assumed that the Americans were retreating or redeploying. However, Stark had decided to capitalize on weaknesses in the German's widely distributed position, and had sent sizable flanking parties to <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> lines. These movements were assisted by a ruse employed by Stark's men that enabled them to get closer safely without alarming the opposing forces. The Germans, most of whom spoke no English, had been told that soldiers with bits of white paper in their hat were Loyalists, and should not be fired on; Stark's men had also heard this and many of them had suitably adorned their hats.|$|E
50|$|George A. Best was an English {{football}} goalkeeper. He played professionally for Blackpool in {{the early}} 20th century, <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> spells with <b>his</b> hometown club, Worksop Town.|$|R
6000|$|As {{soon as the}} {{candidate}} had arisen, the two [...] "ancient knights" [...] returned, and all being in readiness he was escorted to the chapel, the two walking, one upon <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> him, <b>his</b> squires <b>of</b> honor marching before, and the whole party preceded by [...] "sundry minstrels making a loud noise of music." ...|$|R
60|$|Presently Lambert Groot came in, {{grave and}} saddened, with the {{intelligence}} that Philip the Good had departed in peace, {{with his wife}} and son on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> him, and <b>his</b> little granddaughter kneeling beside the Duchess.|$|R
2500|$|In the 20th stanza of {{the fourth}} canto, Māgha {{describes}} the simultaneous setting {{of the sun and}} the rising of the moon {{on either side of the}} Meru mountain as like a mighty elephant with two bells dangling on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body. This striking imagery has earned Māgha the sobriquet of Ghaṇṭāmāgha, [...] "Bell-Māgha". His similes are also highly original, and many verses from the work are of independent interest, and are quoted for their poetic or moral nature.|$|E
60|$|He {{put a hand}} on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{head and}} rocked himself to and fro, droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.|$|E
60|$|The Turk moved, {{started to}} rise, slowly, as though under force. He looked rather shamefaced. He uncrossed {{his legs and}} {{put his hands on}} the pew, on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> legs.|$|E
50|$|As well as {{the word}} games, a game called Smelly Telly is played, usually {{when there is a}} score of 2/1 and never more than twice per show. While a covered raised silver plate is sneaked onto the set, Sharky will sing a song about Smelly Telly which he {{probably}} makes up while he goes. Miranda puts blindfolds on the players, one resembling goggles for the contender, and one resembling headphones for Sharky, since he has eyes on <b>either</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> head. Miranda reveals what the smell is coming from, and even if it is a good smell, the audience will make sounds like it is bad. The players each get a smell, and are allowed to guess and win a fish cake if they are correct. If both players are incorrect, however, unlike the word games, no fish cakes are won, and the players will only get one chance to guess.|$|R
60|$|Mills' {{disappearance}} {{was very}} brief, {{and in a}} very few moments they found themselves seated once more at the table. They sat one on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> him, watching <b>his</b> glass and his plate. By degrees their questions and his answers became more intelligible.|$|R
60|$|She {{swept out}} of the room. Hill would have {{followed}} her, but Mrs. White and Miss Ellicot laid each a hand upon his arm, one on <b>either</b> <b>side.</b> The echoes <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hard, unpleasant laugh reached Anna on her way upstairs.|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't be beat," [...] he said--incorrectly--replaced his glasses, {{brought his}} elbows down on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> box with {{resonant}} violence, and clutched the hair {{over his ears}} with both hands....|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{have you}} made up your mind?" [...] asked the father, resting his elbows on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> plate, and putting his hands {{together}} softly, while he looked across them with a cheery kindness at his boy.|$|E
60|$|Ashurst's {{hair was}} smooth, pale, wavy, {{and had a}} way of rising on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> brow, as if always being flung back; Carton's was a kind of dark unfathomed mop. They had not met a soul for miles.|$|E
60|$|His beaming face {{told the}} good news before a word could be spoken on <b>either</b> <b>side.</b> The excess <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{happiness}} literally and truly deprived him of speech. He stood eagerly looking at us all three, with outstretched hands and glistening eyes.|$|R
50|$|He {{received}} a massive design overhaul in Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc. His hairstyle was redesigned {{to look more}} wild and the lines on his face were also changed. His torso was also redesigned to look more rectangular, with his bandana turned into a hood. His trainers were also modified, with a red spot on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> them (<b>his</b> sneakers in Rayman Origins were a combination <b>of</b> <b>his</b> sneakers from before and after Rayman 3). Players in Rayman Raving Rabbids can dress Rayman {{in a variety of}} costumes. They start with the choices of Disco, Gangsta, and Granny; as they unlock more minigames, more costumes, such as Rock 'n' roll, DJ, Gothic and eventually a bunny suit, become available.|$|R
60|$|For {{three days}} he had cast {{occasional}} glances at this man, {{seated in the}} criminal dock with a gaoler on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> him, <b>his</b> fine, nervous features gaining an added distinction from the sordidness <b>of</b> <b>his</b> surroundings. Now, in the garb of civilisation, seated amidst luxury {{to which he was}} obviously accustomed, with a becoming light upon his face and this strange, fascinating flow of words proceeding always from his lips, the man, from every external point of view, seemed amongst the chosen ones of the world. The contrast was in itself amazing. And then the woman! Francis looked at her but seldom, and when he did it was with a curious sense of mental disturbance; poignant but unanalysable.|$|R
60|$|He would {{survey the}} {{destructive}} counter-stroke with unconcealed surprise. He would verify his first impression by craning towards it and adjusting his glasses on his nose. He had a characteristic {{way of doing}} this with one stiff finger on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> sturdy nose.|$|E
60|$|A great pile {{of living}} embers {{diffused}} {{a strong and}} ruddy glow from the arched chimney. Before this straddled Dom Nicolas, the Picardy monk, with his skirts picked up and his fat legs bared to the comfortable warmth. His dilated shadow cut the room in half; and the firelight only escaped on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> broad person, and in a little pool between his outspread feet. His face had the beery, bruised appearance of the continual drinker's; it {{was covered with a}} network of congested veins, purple in ordinary circumstances, but now pale violet, for even {{with his back to the}} fire the cold pinched him on the other side. His cowl had half fallen back, and made a strange excrescence on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> bull neck. So he straddled, grumbling, and cut the room in half with the shadow of his portly frame.|$|E
60|$|It was Toto {{that made}} Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing as gray as her other surroundings. Toto was not gray; {{he was a}} little black dog, with long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> funny, wee nose. Toto played all day long, and Dorothy played with him, and loved him dearly.|$|E
40|$|Photograph of {{an officer}} {{directing}} traffic in an intersection, [s. d. ]. A {{man wearing a}} uniform and round helmet or hat can be seen standing {{on top of a}} short, wooden box near the edge of a crosswalk. He is facing right and looking towards his right with his arms outstretched to <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> him. <b>His</b> uniform consists <b>of</b> pants, a button-up jacket with a high neck, and gloves. Three automobiles can be seen behind him on the road, while a stoplight is visible at left near the sidewalk. Buildings line the road and can be seen behind the automobiles. A sign on top of a two-story building at right reads, "[ [...] . ] State Bank". Negative sleeve reads, "Early traffic"...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{have been}} a good many reasons. I'll tell you now," [...] Ralph said. He pulled off his hat and laid it on the ground; then he sat looking at her. He leaned back under the {{protection}} <b>of</b> Bernini, <b>his</b> head against his marble pedestal, his arms dropped on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> him, <b>his</b> hands laid upon the rests <b>of</b> <b>his</b> wide chair. He looked awkward, uncomfortable; he hesitated long. Isabel said nothing; when people were embarrassed she was usually sorry for them, but she was determined not to help Ralph to utter a word that should not be to the honour of her high decision. [...] "I think I've hardly got over my surprise," [...] he went on at last. [...] "You were the last person I expected to see caught." ...|$|R
5000|$|A strike {{delivered}} to an opponent {{down on one}} knee. After stepping off the opponent's raised knee with one foot, the wrestler swings his other leg and strikes the opponent's head with <b>either</b> the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> knee or his shin. A slight variation, which sees the wrestler use a running enzuigiri to the kneeling opponent's head {{without the use of}} the opponent's knee for leverage, is known as a Shining Apprentice. Many other [...] "shining" [...] attacks exist, including big boots and dropkicks. The shining wizard can be applied to a standing opponent as well; this would be likely applied by stepping off the opponent's chest and then delivering a knee smash to the opponent's face. The move was created by Keiji Mutoh, otherwise known as the Great Muta.|$|R
6000|$|... "My princess," [...] he said, [...] "you may count {{upon your}} Königsmark {{while he has}} life." [...] Disengaging her hands from his lapels, but still holding them, he bowed low over them, so low that his heavy golden mane tumbled forward on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{handsome}} head to form a screen under cover of which he pressed his lips upon her fingers.|$|E
60|$|As Buck slid {{along with}} the obscureness of a gliding shadow, his nose was jerked {{suddenly}} to the side as though a positive force had gripped and pulled it. He followed the new scent into a thicket and found Nig. He was lying on his side, dead where he had dragged himself, an arrow protruding, head and feathers, from <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body.|$|E
60|$|They {{turned to}} confront M. Binet. Moving with that {{noiseless}} tread of his, {{he had come}} up unheard behind them, and there he stood now in his scarlet suit of Pantaloon under a trailing bedgown, his little eyes glaring from <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> false nose. But their attention was held by the voice of Scaramouche. He had stepped {{to the front of}} the stage.|$|E
50|$|This rock cut Jain {{temple was}} built by Western Ganga King Rajamalla II during the end of 9th century. This temple is seen in a hillock named Vijayadri (as per {{inscription}} of Rajamalla II) located northern <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Thun Andar Shiva temple. Inside the rock cut, recently a new Mahaveerar statue is kept and worshipped by nearby Tamil Jains. On {{the top of the}} rock facing east, relief sculptures of Mahaveerar, Parshavanthar and Bahubali are seen.On the <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Bahubali, <b>his</b> sisters Brahmi and Saundari are seen. On the top, left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Bahubali, Indra sitting on elephant and right side, two Gandharvas are seen. The left hand of the Bahubali was damaged. The head of Parshavanathar is surrounded by five headed snake. The left and right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Parshavanathar, <b>his</b> attendants Padmavathi and Daranendran can be seen. Both the images of Bahubali and Parshavanathar were carved in standing posture. The image of Mahaveerar, sitting in Sukhasana position on a Simhasana with his attendants on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> is seen at the extreme southern direction.|$|R
6000|$|A curious {{group as}} they sit {{staring into the}} fire. Juno and Juno's {{daughter}} Bess, brindles both, with their underhanging lower jaws, and their black noses and wrinkled faces, and Jack Simpson, now six years old, sitting between them, as grave and as immovable as his supporters. One dog is on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> him and <b>his</b> arms are thrown round their broad backs. Mrs. Haden is laying the table for her husband's return; she glances occasionally at the quiet group {{in front of the}} fire, and mutters to herself: [...] "I never did see such a child in all my born days." ...|$|R
60|$|Entering {{into his}} boisterous humour, for {{they all had}} drunk deeply, and were as wild as he, they crowded about him, while two of their number who had torches, held them up, one on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> him, that <b>his</b> banquet might not be {{despatched}} in the dark. Mr Dennis, having by this time succeeded in extricating from his hat a great mass of pasty, which had been wedged in so tightly {{that it was not}} easily got out, put it before him; and Hugh, having borrowed a notched and jagged knife from one of the company, fell to work upon it vigorously.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not such a cage as Peter Brown's office; {{and besides}} {{it is only}} when he is lashed up that the panther leaps about his den. Generally he is a quiet {{determined}} animal, with the practical Yankee element strong in him. It may be true, as Edgar says, that he does not see an inch on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> nose, but that only makes him go right away in the line he does see. I know he will work well.' ...|$|E
60|$|And Davis {{turned and}} passed slowly away. But {{even as he}} went, he was meditating a prompt, {{offensive}} return. In the twinkling of an eye he had leaped behind a tree; and was crouching there, pistol in hand, peering from <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> place of ambush with bared teeth; a serpent already poised to strike. And already he was too late. Attwater and his servants had disappeared; and only the lamps shone on the deserted table and the bright sand about the house, and threw into the night in all directions the strong and tall shadows of the palms.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Meadowcroft {{preserved}} unbroken {{silence as}} we {{walked back to the}} farm on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> invalid-chair. His last reserves of resolution seemed to have given way under the overwhelming strain laid on them by the proceedings in court. His daughter, in stern indulgence to Naomi, mercifully permitted her opinion to glimmer on us only through the medium of quotation from Scripture texts. If the texts meant anything, they meant that she had foreseen all that had happened; and that the one sad aspect of the case, to her mind, was the death of John Jago, unprepared to meet his end.|$|E
60|$|The {{commander}} has not moved. He now {{removes his}} field-glass {{from his eyes}} and glances {{to the right and}} left. He sees the human current flowing on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> him and <b>his</b> huddled escort, like tide waves parted by a rock. Not a sign <b>of</b> feeling in <b>his</b> face; he is thinking. Again he directs his eyes forward; they slowly traverse that malign and awful crest. He addresses a calm word to his bugler. Tra-la-la! Tra-la-la! The injunction has an imperiousness which enforces it. It is repeated by all the bugles of all the sub-ordinate commanders; the sharp metallic notes assert themselves above the hum of the advance and penetrate the sound of the cannon. To halt is to withdraw. The colors move slowly back; the lines face about and sullenly follow, bearing their wounded; the skirmishers return, gathering up the dead.|$|R
60|$|Gashford walked stealthily about, {{listening}} to all he heard, and diffusing or confirming, whenever he had an opportunity, such false intelligence as suited his own purpose; and, busily occupied in this way, turned into Holborn for the twentieth time, when a great many women and children came flying along the street--often panting and looking back--and the confused murmur of numerous voices struck upon his ear. Assured by these tokens, and by the red light which began to flash upon the houses on <b>either</b> <b>side,</b> that some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> friends were indeed approaching, he begged a moment's shelter at a door which opened as he passed, and running with some other persons to an upper window, looked out upon the crowd.|$|R
6000|$|... "Commander of the Faithful," [...] I replied, again bowing humbly before him, [...] "I {{can assure}} your Majesty {{that he has}} in no way exaggerated his wealth and grandeur. Nothing can equal the magnificence <b>of</b> <b>his</b> palace. When he goes abroad his throne is {{prepared}} upon {{the back of an}} elephant, and on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> him ride <b>his</b> ministers, his favourites, and courtiers. On his elephant's neck sits an officer, his golden lance in his hand, and behind him stands another bearing a pillar of gold, at the top of which is an emerald as long as my hand. A thousand men in cloth of gold, mounted upon richly caparisoned elephants, go before him, and as the procession moves onward the officer who guides his elephant cries aloud, `Behold the mighty monarch, the powerful and valiant Sultan of the Indies, whose palace is covered with a hundred thousand rubies, who possesses twenty thousand diamond crowns. Behold a monarch greater than Solomon and Mihrage in all their glory!'" ...|$|R
