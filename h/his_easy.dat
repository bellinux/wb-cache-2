5|$|Heber was {{interested}} {{in all aspects of}} Indian life and quickly made friends, both with the local population and with the representatives of non-Anglican churches. Occasionally <b>his</b> <b>easy</b> manner and lavish hospitality clashed with the principles of the more puritan and evangelical of his clergy; one such, Isaac Wilson of the CMS, used a sermon to mount a direct attack on the bishop after what he considered were excessive celebrations following a baptismal service. Wilson was forced to apologise after Heber threatened him with a Consistory court.|$|E
25|$|According to Dirk Benedict, Robert Vaughn was {{actually}} {{added to the}} cast in season 5 because of his friendship with the notoriously prickly George Peppard. It was hoped that Vaughn would help ease worsening tensions between Peppard and Mr. T. In a later interview, Vaughn recounted how T's verbosity and loud personality would get on everyone's nerves, including his, {{even though he had}} been hired specifically because of <b>his</b> <b>easy</b> going and calming personality.|$|E
25|$|In {{his effort}} {{to fit into the}} local environment, Ananthan {{gradually}} wins the villagers' hearts over by <b>his</b> <b>easy</b> and kind manners. This appreciation is breached briefly when the magician takes over his mind for a short while. Meanwhile, Ananthan's cousin Bhadra (Kavya Madhavan) falls for him and his light-hearted flirting, eventually leading to a commitment of love between them. At one point, Bhadra faces the dilemma of choosing between Ananthan's love and becoming a Devi (goddess) in a mystical ritual of self-offering.|$|E

25|$|Newspaper reports {{mention that}} Chang dealt {{exclusively}} with young women. One of his methods {{was to have}} a waiter pass a note to pretty girls in his restaurants saying that he admired them and {{would like to have a}} quiet dinner with them sometime. Many then went on to become his customers, and some his lovers. <b>His</b> <b>easy</b> manners, charisma and exotic appeal meant that he was able to build up a large female clientele that was close to a fan club. In order to distance himself from the actual transaction, the goods and money were exchanged over a high wall so that the parties were invisible to each other.|$|E

However, Alex Megos, after repeting it in 2016, stated that this was neither one of his hardest, nor one of <b>his</b> <b>easiest</b> 8C+ routes.|$|R
2500|$|Henry and Richard were [...] "both tall in stature, rather {{above the}} middle size, and of {{commanding}} aspect.

His extraordinary double ability to see how groups would react and the willingness to use violence to make them obey, the capacity to read group behavior and the force to make them move to his will, gave him the chance to exercise what [...] called his [...] "sovereign self" ...|$|E

50|$|Kuzník {{was born}} near Kojetín. During 1739-1764 {{he worked in}} Napajedla as a music teacher (kantor) and organist. Most of his works comes from this period. He {{composed}} church and lay music whose texts concentrate on misery of peasantry and Prussian Wars (he wrote the texts himself). Some of <b>his</b> <b>easier</b> works, composed in Haydn style, are played until today.|$|R
2500|$|This led to {{the famous}} quote [...] "Maurice, you must change your style of bowling immediately". From then on Tate {{developed}} as a tireless fast-medium bowler {{and the founder of}} modern seam bowling. Though not exceptionally fast through the air, Tate gave the illusion of gaining speed off the pitch. <b>His</b> <b>easy,</b> rhythmic action and solid build allowed him to do a great amount of bowling – his bowling of 9567 deliveries in 1925 is unparalleled among bowlers of medium pace or above, this when he was still opening the batting for Sussex in many matches.|$|E
2500|$|Heatly {{joined the}} East India Company as a [...] "writer" [...] in 1766, and later {{worked as a}} merchant. <b>His</b> <b>easy</b> manner, his family's loyalty to Britain, and his {{connections}} to other American royalists stood him in good stead within the Company {{at the time of}} the American Revolution and beyond. When Cornwallis was appointed Governor-General of India, still smarting from his military defeats in America, Heatly became a favourite. He was Collector of Chotanagpur and Palamu by 1774 and by 1783 he held a similar position for Purnia. He held that position still in 1788.|$|E
2500|$|In 1976, Byrd was the [...] "favorite son" [...] Presidential {{candidate}} in West Virginia's primary. <b>His</b> <b>easy</b> victory gave him {{control of the}} delegation to the Democratic National Convention. Byrd had the inside track as majority whip but focused {{most of his time}} running for majority leader, more so than for re-election to the Senate, as he was virtually unopposed for his fourth term. By the time the vote for majority leader came, his lead was so secure that his lone rival, Minnesota's Hubert Humphrey, withdrew before the balloting took place. From 1977 to 1989 Byrd was the leader of the Senate Democrats, serving as majority leader from 1977 to 1981 and 1987 to 1989, and as minority leader from 1981 to 1987.|$|E

2500|$|In 1973, Riggs saw an {{opportunity}} to both make money and {{draw attention to the}} sport of tennis. [...] He came out of retirement to challenge one of the world's greatest female players to a match, claiming that the female game was inferior and that a top female player could not beat him, even at the age of 55. He challenged Margaret Court, 30 years old and the top female player in the world, and they played on May 13, Mother's Day, in Ramona, California. Riggs used his drop shots and lobs to keep an unprepared Court off balance; <b>his</b> <b>easy</b> 6–2, 6–1 victory {{in less than an hour}} landed him on the cover of both Sports Illustrated and Time magazine. The match was called the [...] "Mother's Day Massacre".|$|E
2500|$|The novelist {{tradition}} in Yorkshire {{continued into the}} 20th century, with authors such as J. B.

Taylor Bradford [...] is noted for A Woman of Substance {{which was one of}} the top-ten best selling novels in history. Another well-known author was children's writer Arthur Ransome, who penned the Swallows and Amazons series. James Herriot, the best selling author of over 60 million copies of books about his experiences of some 50 years as a veterinarian in Thirsk, North Yorkshire, the town which he refers to as Darrowby in his books (although born in Sunderland), has been admired for <b>his</b> <b>easy</b> reading style and interesting characters. Poets include Ted Hughes, W. H. Auden, William Empson, Simon Armitage and Andrew Marvell.|$|E
2500|$|He was a fast-medium left-handed bowler {{and could}} {{manipulate}} the release {{so that the}} ball could, {{in the words of}} a later Wisden, [...] "double its speed upon hitting the ground". He bowled from very wide of the bowling crease, but was very straight because of the swing inwards <b>his</b> <b>easy</b> body action generated, whilst his height (he was about 6 foot 1 or 186 centimetres – tall for that time) allowed him to gain a lot of bounce. As a batsman, he was very aggressive and a fast scorer with a good range of strokes – most of his major innings were played at over a run a minute – but on difficult wickets his technique certainly had major flaws which he never was able to truly correct, and which cost him dearly at times.|$|E

2500|$|Hopper {{was unable}} to {{capitalize}} on <b>his</b> <b>Easy</b> Rider success for several years. In 1970 he filmed The Last Movie, cowritten by Stewart Stern and photographed by Laszlo Kovacs in Peru, and completed production in 1971. It won the prestigious CIDALC Award at that year's Venice Film Festival, but Universal Studios leaders expected a blockbuster like Easy Rider, and {{did not like the}} film or give it an enthusiastic release, while American film audiences found it confounding - as convoluted as an abstract painting. On viewing the first release print, fresh from the lab, in his screening room at Universal, MCA founder Jules Stein rose from his chair and said, [...] "I just don't understand this younger generation." [...] During the tumultuous editing process, Hopper ensconced himself at the Mabel Dodge Luhan House in Taos, New Mexico, which he had purchased in 1970, for almost an entire year. In between contesting Fonda's rights to the majority of the residual profits from Easy Rider, he married Michelle Phillips in October 1970.|$|E
2500|$|Baudrillard's provocative 1991 book The Gulf War Did Not Take Place {{raised his}} public profile as an {{academic}} and political commentator. He argued that the first Gulf War was the inverse of the Clausewitzian formula: not [...] "the continuation of politics by other means", but [...] "the continuation {{of the absence of}} politics by other means". Accordingly, Saddam Hussein was not fighting the Coalition, but using the lives of his soldiers as a form of sacrifice to preserve his power (p.72, 2004 edition). The Coalition fighting the Iraqi military was merely dropping 10,000 tonnes of bombs daily, as if proving to themselves that there was an enemy to fight (p.61). So, too, were the Western media complicit, presenting the war in real time, by recycling images of war to propagate the notion that the U.S.-led coalition and the Iraqi government were actually fighting, but, such was not the case. Saddam Hussein did not use his military capacity (the Iraqi Air Force). His power was not weakened, evinced by <b>his</b> <b>easy</b> suppression of the 1991 internal uprisings that followed afterwards. Overall, little had changed. Saddam remained undefeated, the [...] "victors" [...] were not victorious, and thus there was no war—i.e., the Gulf War did not occur.|$|E
2500|$|However, Andy Gill from The Independent {{awarded the}} album two stars. He criticised Minogue's lack of {{creative}} delivery, by stating [...] "But they’re let {{down by the}} lack of character in Kylie’s delivery, most notably on “Santa Claus Is Coming to Town”, a posthumous duet with Frank Sinatra, where <b>his</b> <b>easy,</b> relaxed manner is in sharp contrast to her discomfort." [...] He commended the musical diversity of the tracks, highlighting [...] "Let It Snow", [...] "Winter Wonderland", and [...] "Every Day's Like Christmas", and highlighted [...] "White December", [...] "Cried Out Christmas", and [...] "Christmas Wrapping" [...] as the best tracks. Lauren Murphy from The Irish Times argued the relevance of the album, by stating [...] "We’ve heard it all before, so do we really need another pop star doing another bog-standard Christmas album with a sprinkling of festive cheese? To be fair, Kylie Minogue is better placed than most to do such an album, given her longevity in the business." [...] Murphy concluded [...] "2,000 Miles {{is one of the few}} saving graces on yet another inessential album that will have no bearing on your enjoyment of the festive season whatsoever." [...] Several publications mentioned the album on their anticipated releases of 2015, including the Daily Mail, and Unrealitytv.co.uk.|$|E
