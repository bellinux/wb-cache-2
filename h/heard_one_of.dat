25|$|The name Carlingford {{came into}} use officially on 16 July 1883 {{for the name}} of the post office located at Mobbs Hill. There are varying {{accounts}} of how the name Carlingford was suggested. One version was that local Frederick Cox <b>heard</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his employees describe similarities between Mobbs Hill and the town of Carlingford, County Louth, located in the east of Ireland. Alternatively, and perhaps a happy alignment with the former version, was that Carlingford was named in honour of Lord Carlingford, who was the British Under-secretary to the Colonies 1847-1860.|$|E

In early 1973 they recruited Livgren from the second Kansas group, which then folded. Eventually they received a recording contract with Don Kirshner's eponymous label, after Kirshner's assistant, Wally Gold, <b>heard</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> their demo tapes and came out to check out the band at one of their local gigs in March 1973. After signing with Kirshner, the group decided to adopt the Kansas name.|$|E

25|$|As a result, Cao Cao ordered Zuo Ci to be executed, but Zuo had disappeared. Cao Cao {{sent his}} general Xu Chu to capture Zuo Ci, Xu saw Zuo walking among {{a flock of}} sheep and slew the flock, {{thinking}} Zuo had become a sheep; when Xu had left the shepherd boy who had been tending the flock <b>heard</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the sheep's heads telling him to place the heads next to the bodies {{to bring them back}} to life, the boy did this and the sheep returned to life. After Xu Chu failed to capture Zuo Ci, Cao Cao put out posters calling for Zuo Ci's capture, and as a result hundreds of men matching the exact description of Zuo were found, and Cao ordered them all executed. When they were all executed black vapor rose from their necks where they joined to form another image of Zuo Ci. The image summoned a crane for him to sit on, and Cao Cao had archers to shoot him down. Suddenly, a gust of wind brought the decapitated corpses back to life. The reanimated corpses carried their heads and started to beat Cao Cao. Cao Cao fainted due to shock, the winds died down, and Zuo Ci disappeared along with the corpses.|$|E

He was extracted by an agent, kicked, and taken away from the scene. While being escorted, he saw the two activists {{directly in front of}} his vehicle being beaten by the armed men.|$|E

In 1968, he told Guitar Player magazine that electric blues artists Muddy Waters, Elmore James, and B.B. King inspired him during {{the beginning of his}} career; he also cited Eddie Cochran as an early influence. Of Muddy Waters, the first electric guitarist of which Hendrix became aware, he said: [...] "I <b>heard</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his records when I was a little boy and it scared me to death because I heard all of these sounds." [...] In 1970, he told Rolling Stone that he was a fan of western swing artist Bob Wills and while he lived in Nashville, the television show the Grand Ole Opry.|$|E
500|$|In 1998, Lukather {{received}} {{an invitation to}} tour Japan with fellow guitarist Larry Carlton after Japanese promoters requested that Carlton's annual tours each {{be different from the}} last. Lukather and Carlton exchanged some recorded material and decided that a collaboration would be interesting. Lukather was flattered by the invitation to tour with Carlton, citing him as his favorite guitarist. Lukather speaks highly of their stage efforts, although the two were admittedly outside their normal realm of work. He stated in an interview that [...] "you can hear us having fun on the record—you can hear the smiles on our faces." [...] After several shows, the duo realized that they should record their collaboration even if just for their own use. Guitarist and producer Steve Vai <b>heard</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the subsequent recordings and expressed interest in releasing it under his Favored Nations label, also home to such artists as Eric Johnson and Dweezil Zappa. Vai and Lukather mixed and produced the recording, which {{is said to be a}} mixture of jazz, blues, and fusion music. The resulting album, , won a 2001 Grammy award for Best Pop Instrumental Album. Album reviewers described Lukather as having a heavier style than Carlton. Lukather and Carlton later did an international tour in support of the album.|$|E

Derrickson called the score [...] "magic in the literal sense of the word," [...] adding Giacchino [...] "is doing what good scorers do, which is he is not just creating music that supports the images, he's adding a third thing to the movie. It becomes something new with his music in there that it didn't have with temp music." [...] The score was recorded at Abbey Road Studios. During a recording session, Paul McCartney <b>heard</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Giacchino's cues being recorded and likened it to The Beatles song [...] "I Am the Walrus". Derrickson, a Bob Dylan fan, looked for {{a place in the}} film to include one of his songs, but could not find one. However, he was able to include the song [...] "Interstellar Overdrive" [...] by Pink Floyd. Derrickson had hoped to use either [...] "Interstellar Overdrive" [...] or The Jimi Hendrix Experience's [...] "Are You Experienced?" [...] for the film's credits, but the royalties to use either in the credits were too expensive, resulting in Giacchino creating the track [...] "The Master Of The Mystic End Credits".

Subsequently, 46 men were indicted for burning their draft cards at various rallies, and four major court cases were <b>heard.</b> <b>One</b> <b>of</b> them, United States v.
