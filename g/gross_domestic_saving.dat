40|$|M. Comm. (Economics) The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the pattern of <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>saving</b> in South Africa. This study looks at <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>saving</b> in South Africa in general and the trends of its {{components}} in particular. It addresses the impacts of internal and external policies on the disaggregated domestic saving in South Africa. This is done with the aim of establishing the channels through which these policies influence the components of South Africa’s domestic saving. This study focuses on current economic literature while examining <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>saving</b> and its attributes. A brief discussion of <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>saving</b> on emerging market region puts sub-Saharan Africa’s <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>saving,</b> particularly that of South Africa, into perspective. Hence, the developments in South Africa’s domestic saving are compared with those of some selected countries. An analysis of <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>saving</b> in South Africa for the period 1970 to 2004 indicates a long-run downward pattern. The disaggregated domestic saving in South Africa shows that although three components contributed to the decline in South Africa’s domestic saving, the public sector appeared to be the main culprit in the decline. Thus, the net saving by the government had been negative since early 1980. The study observes that the patterns of saving of the three components are influenced by both internal and external factors. iv These internal and external factors are made up of fiscal and monetary policies, and the balance of payments. Without over-emphasising the importance of <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>saving</b> in any economy, it is crucial for South Africa to encourage a positive saving culture for improvement in meaningful domestic investment for long-term economic growth. This study, therefore, suggests that in a developing economy like the South African economy, a positive saving attitude could be encouraged through the use of internal and external policies. Hence, the positive impact of internal and external factors could motivate all stakeholders in <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>saving</b> to seize any available opportunity to boost their savings, thereby raising South Africa’s <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>saving...</b>|$|E

During the last few years, the saving rate has fallen marginally raising concern that it might adversely affect economic growth. We take a long run view. We explore {{whether there is a}} long run relationship between GDP and saving. In doing so, we distinguish between <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>saving</b> and gross domestic private saving. We posit that gross domestic private saving rather than <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>saving</b> is more important in determining GDP. We find that both <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>saving</b> and gross domestic private saving are cointegrated with GDP. However, causality tests between the growth of gross domestic saving/the growth of private domestic saving and the growth of GDP indicate that the causality does not run in any direction. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the effects of}} foreign investment in Indonesian’s economic growth for the period 1970 to 1996. Economic growth is measured by growth in <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> product (GDP) and <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> income (GNI). Two types of foreign investment are considered: foreign direct investment (FDI) and net private capital flows. Other determinants of economic growth {{included in the analysis}} are human capital and <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>savings.</b> The results suggest that foreign direct investment, net private capital, human capital and <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>savings</b> jointly influence economic growth. Foreign direct investment has a significant positive effect on economic growth, while net private capital has no significant effect. Human capital, proxied by the proportion of the population in the labour force and secondary school enrolments, and <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>savings,</b> also exert a positive influence on economic growth. On the basis of the analysis, it is suggested that, to enhance the role of FDI in Indonesia’s economic growth, the government should encourage the quality of human capital through improved education and improved skills training. ...|$|R

We test the hypothesis that shifts in women's relative income, which can affect their bargaining power within the household, have a discernible impact on household saving and, by extension, <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>saving,</b> due to differing saving propensities by gender. The empirical analysis is based on panel data {{for a set of}} semi-industrialised economies, covering the period 1975 - 95. The results indicate that, as some measures of women's relative income and bargaining power increase, <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>saving</b> rates rise. The implied gender disparity in saving propensities may be linked to differences in saving motives based on gender roles, and well as divergent experiences of economic vulnerability.

The estimated results indicate both variables are one order of integration at level or 1 (1). Second, the long-run relationship between the series was explored utilizing both Engel- Granger and Johnson Cointegration Test procedure. The result of the test indicated that the series were cointegrated. Finally, the causal relationship between growth rate of <b>domestic</b> <b>savings</b> and the growth rate of real GDP was performed using the Vector Error Correction (VECM) model and Pairwise Granger Causality test. Theories and empirical works have shown that the direction of causality between <b>domestic</b> <b>savings</b> growth and economic growth may run in various directions: from <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>savings</b> to economic growth, from economic growth to <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>savings,</b> bidirectional causality between <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>savings</b> and economic growth or no causal relationship between them.

40|$|The {{fact that}} saving {{is one of}} the main factors to {{economic}} growth is unquestionable. Accumulated saving can be consider as the sources of capital stock to which play a crucial role in creating investment, production, and employment. And all these activities eventually enhance the economic growth. Therefore the main objective of this paper, ―The relationship between domestic saving and economic growth and convergence hypothesis: case study of Thailand‖, was to investigate the causality relationship between the domestic saving and economic growth of Thailand. This paper will analyze whether the direction of causality go from domestic saving to economic growth, or vice versa. Granger causality test were conducted by using time series annual data from 1960 to 2010, and the empirical result suggests that the direct of causality go from economic growth to domestic saving only. Aiming to grow its economy, Thailand had had development plans which used both saving and direct investment to stimulate economy. This paper examine whether the convergence hypothesis does hold in Thailand. This part would check whether or not Thailand is in the process of convergence, catching up, lagging behind, loose catching up, loose lagging behind or divergence over time compared with other developed countries. This test was conducted in pairwise between Thailand-Singapore, Thailand-United States, Thailand-United Kingdom, deployed data from 1970 to 2010, and the Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) Test. The regression results demonstrate that convergence hypothesis does not hold in Thailand. Finally, the result of Granger Causality report that economic growth rate does matter lead to growth rate of domestic savings in Thailand only.

The study employs the recently developed ARDL- bounds testing approach. The article finds there is strong evidence that growth rate of income, <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>savings</b> play a stronger role in determining the short run and long run behavior of energy consumption per capita in G 7 countries. The empirical results suggested that in most of the countries the relationship of consumption per capita and <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> income is positive, that means when the income rises the consumption will also rise but not necessarily at the same rate, which is in accordance with theory of Keynes of marginal propensity to consume, confirming the absolute income hypothesis. On the other hand the <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>savings</b> has a negative relationship with the energy consumption per capita which confirms the same relationship of consumption as the function of difference of income and savings in long run. The Parameters of error correction terms in USA and France are - 0. 4283 and - 0. 6190 represents the speed of adjustment is very high and it would return back to the equilibrium level very quickly. While countries like Canada, Germany, and Great Britain are having the parameters of the error correction term as - 0. 0794, - 0. 2205, and - 0. 0867 suggests speed of adjustments is fairly very small and would take time to return to its equilibrium position. While the error correction coefficient in case of Japan is equal to - 1. 0183, and also statistically significant showing that convergence is more elastic. The study suggests that although Japan, Italy, USA, France are more industrially advanced countries as production is mostly based on industries.

This paper examines the relationship between <b>Gross</b> <b>Domestic</b> Product (GDP), <b>Gross</b> Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) and <b>Gross</b> <b>Domestic</b> <b>Savings</b> (GDS) in the context of Indian Economy. To analyse the relationship, data for a long period of 63 years i. e., from 1950 – 1951 to 2012 – 2013 has been used. To derive accurate results usually a lengthy period is considered. Structural changes may take place when the regression model involves time series data to measure the relationship between the regressand and the regressors. In fact, structural changes may occur due to policy changes and many other factors. Therefore, to estimate these structural changes the chow break point test has been used. The data used has been divided into pre-reform period that is from 1950 – 51 to 1990 – 91 and post-reform period -from 1991 – 92 to 2012 – 2013. An analysis of the relationship suggests that GDS and GFCF have differently influenced GDP in the pre-reform and postreform period. The Chow break point test also confirms the results.

This way, these countries suffered stoppages of capital influx, capital out flux going back their original countries, contraction of their Exports, Gross Domestic Product, increasing in unemployment rates. Therefore, for emerging and/or developing economies with open markets and relatively tiny participation in the world economy, as well as without the possibility of creating a global currency is highly recommendable to keep up with Flexible Exchange Rate regimens allowing intervention of the Central Bank to deal with external adverse shocks or domestic financial problems with the aim to reduce possibilities of financial crisis. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} so-called 'Feldstein-Horioka paradox' 3, {{according to which}} there exists a significant, close to unity relation between the magnitudes of gross domestic investment and <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>saving</b> of an economy. Feldstein and Horioka (1980) 4 found such a close to unity relation for a sample of sixteen developed members of the OECD. Opposite to what common intuition would dictate, the 'FH paradox' as interpreted by FH themselves, seemed to be pointing towards a lack of international capital mobility, in a world thought of as utterly 'globalized', and hence receptive {{to any kind of}} goods and capital flows, especially in the era launched {{by the end of the}} 1973 oil crisis. Due exactly to its paradoxicality the FH finding triggered a long-lasting and vehement controversy, which has revolved around the implementation of ever more sophisticated econometric techniques, based on the conviction that only this way would a conundrum like the 'FH paradox' finally be resolved. This has also been the reason why we have attempted to structure this dissertation, around the axis of the various econometric methods used so far in the relative literature. In the empirical part of the dissertation, we also adopt many of the aforementioned econometric methods met in the literature, but our main contribution resides in our attempt to better define the variables involved in the initial FH specification from an accounting point of view. More specifically, regarding the saving part (right-hand side) of the classical FH regression equation, we use the balancing item of the 'Use of disposable income account' 5 of the 2008 System of National Accounts (SNA) as a proxy for what FH (1980) had called <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>saving,</b> deeming it as properly describing the purely domestic constituents of an economy's total saving. Regarding the investment part (left-hand side) of the classical FH regression equation however, we strongly question the extent to which the variable of gross domestic investment which FH (1980) used, really corresponds to an economy's actual gross domestic investment. In fact, FH's gross domestic investment has been the former name of the SNA magnitude of gross capital formation (GCF), which according to the 2008 SNA is ' [...] . measured by the total value of the gross fixed capital formation 6, changes in inventories and acquisitions less disposals of valuables'. Following our electronic correspondence with IMF's specialist on National Accounts and Balance of Payments issues Ms S. Matei 7, and given that actually, the majority of the more recent papers within the FH literature have used GFCF as a proxy for FH's variable of 'gross domestic investment', we are also focusing on GFCF in our analysis, instead of the (broader) magnitude of GCF, deeming it more representative of the purely productive part of an economy's domestic investment. However, based on the accounting definitions of both GCF and GFCF one can realize that numerous foreign capital elements might also be included in them 8. As a means of 'cleansing' GFCF from any foreign fixed capital assets incorporated in it, we propose instead the magnitude of modified gross fixed capital formation (MGFCF), which is derived by subtracting an economy's imports of fixed capital assets destined to GFCF from the economy's GFCF itself. In the empirical part of the dissertation, we use data for three economically developed countries of Northern Europe, namely Norway, Netherlands and Finland. Using various alternative model specifications, apart from the initial FH one, we find that the generally high values of the saving-investment relation must be attributed to the significant autocorrelation latent in them. Using our own variable MGFCF instead, the aforementioned autocorrelation is significantly reduced or even eliminated. Additionally, we use stationarity and cointegration tests for the variables involved under each one of the various FH model specifications tested. An overall conclusion of our tests, is that the degree of international capital mobility for the three countries of our sample is in fact bigger than the one which the 'FH paradox' would imply. Despite the general lack of data for imports of fixed capital assets from which necessarily suffers the approach we propose, promising perspectives for further research in the future can be discerned. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to empirically investigate the long run and short run dynamic impact of interest rate and output on <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>savings</b> and <b>gross</b> capital formation in Nigeria. Literatures, both theoretical and empirical, suggest that the rate of interest and output are the key factors influencing savings and investments. A review of factors influencing interest rates and output in Nigeria is necessitated by the recent economic downturns in Nigeria that has resulted in tight monetary policy which some commentators regard as inimical to growth. Employing Ordinary Least Squares, Co-integration, Error Correction Mechanism and Granger Causality econometric techniques on a data spanning 1981 to 2014 of the Nigerian economy sourced from the World Development Index, it was found that changes in output explains the long run and short run dynamic behaviour of <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>savings</b> and <b>gross</b> capital formation which were used as proxies for savings and investment respectively. Whereas, a bi-causality was established between output and investment, causality flowed from output to savings in Nigeria. The research also found that interest rate is not a significant determinant of savings and investment in Nigeria in both long run and short run. It is therefore recommended that to enhance investment in a period of economic downturn in Nigeria, aggregate demand should be boosted to enhance output through vigorous pursuit of fiscal policy while implementing contractionary monetary policy to address inflationary pressures created by the increase in demand. <b>Domestic</b> <b>savings</b> will improve and gross capital formation will be sustained...|$|R

The reversal ofbalance of payments to moderate levels of the current account deficit, combined withsome adjustment in the fiscal accounts and a small increase in the private savings, mayraise the investment ratio to 25 % of GDP up to 2010, expanding the growth potential ofthe economy. The challenge is how to materialize this potential. The paper describes thedata for <b>domestic</b> <b>savings,</b> and disaggregates it into public and private sources combiningNational Accounts information, which is not widely available, with fiscal accounting datafrom the Central Bank. ...|$|R
25|$|India's <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>savings</b> in 2006–07 as a {{percentage}} of GDP stood at a high 32.8%. More than half of personal savings are invested in physical assets such as land, houses, cattle, and gold. The government-owned public-sector banks hold over 75% of total assets of the banking industry, with the private and foreign banks holding 18.2% and 6.5% respectively. Since liberalisation, the government has approved significant banking reforms. While some of these relate to nationalised banks – such as reforms encouraging mergers, reducing government interference and increasing profitability and competitiveness – other reforms have opened the banking and insurance sectors to private and foreign companies.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between economic growth and savings in Indonesia from 1981 2012. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is added as an extra variable to identify possible spuriousness in the causation. The Johansen test on cointegration is used {{to search for a}} long run relationship, a Vector Error Correction (VEC) model is constructed to examine a short run relationship and the Granger test on causality is used to find the direction of the relationship. After performing robustness checks, it can be concluded that there is significant evidence that <b>Gross</b> <b>Domestic</b> <b>Savings</b> (GDS) and <b>Gross</b> <b>Domestic</b> Product (GDP) are cointegrated and therefore hold a long run relationship. Via the Wald test, also a short run relationship is identified. The Granger test indicates that savings are Granger-caused by economic growth. FDI does not play a significant role...|$|R
40|$|Societies {{should be}} ideally equitable. However, {{in reality the}} {{scenario}} is very different and the phenomena of socio-economic inequalities have plagued mankind from times immemorial. We now ask a question: Can higher savings moderate the income inequality? In this paper, {{we have tried to}} address this question and establish an empirical link between the income inequality with savings, mainly for closed economies, and also relate it to an existing theoretical model based on the principle of kinetic theory of gases. We tested our model empirically using Gini Index (a measure for income inequality) and <b>Gross</b> <b>Domestic</b> <b>Savings</b> (percentage of GDP), and observed that our model holds reasonably true for many real closed economies of the world.

40|$|In recent years, the {{changing}} {{economic and political}} environment in Tunisia led to a renewed interest on the drivers of foreign direct investment, given its potential important gains. In this study, we investigated the impact of various factors over the period 1980 - 2012. In doing this, three categories of determinants were considered: economic, political and sociocultural variables. Empirical findings drawn from the autoregressive distributed lag bounds testing approach show that variation in foreign direct investment inflow in the short-run and long-run {{is affected by the}} majority of variables considered, except exchange rate, urban population and <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>savings.</b> As a matter of policy, it is essential that government should continue its efforts to create a macroeconomic environment which is attractive to foreign direct investment...|$|R
40|$|The study {{investigates the}} effect of the {{instability}} of export earnings on gross fixed capital forma-tion (total investment) in Ghana over the period, 1981 to 2011, marked by continuous political stability. The analysis employs the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) method of cointegration to evaluate a set of factors, which affect investment as measured by the investment to gross do-mestic product (GDP) ratio. The results of the analysis confirm the expected negative relationship between export earnings instability and investment. Other factors that significantly influence in-vestment in Ghana are real GDP growth, merchandise trade balance, real interest rate and <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>savings</b> ratio. Based on the analysis, we recommend policy measures aimed at increasing the <b>domestic</b> <b>savings</b> ratio and export diversification given the re-emergence of reduced real val-ues of Ghanaian export commodities in the world market after the high values of these commodi-ties during {{the first decade of the}} 21 st century...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} some {{characteristics of}} economic and econometricliterature {{in the field of}} FDI after 1990, in Romania, as well as some specific issues in the process of practical modelling. A more detailed presentation of John Harry Dunning’s eclectic theory and a simple presentation of the theory of de-investment complete the general theoretical presentation of FDI. A first problem after the definition, life cycle, similarities and differences betweenportfolio and direct foreign investment, after the benefits of FDI, is given by the outstanding dynamics and structure of FDI. Some characteristic features of the value oscillation and structural dynamics of gross capital formation (GCF), gross capital fixed capital formation (GFCF) and <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>savings</b> (GDS) in GDP are relevant for the specificity of the phenomenon of FDI in Romania after 1990...|$|R
