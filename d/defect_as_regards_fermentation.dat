40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{evaluate}} clinically, radio-graphically and electro-myographically {{the added}} value after converting conventional obturator to implant retained one using Zygomatic implant {{for patients with}} acquired partial palatomaxillary <b>defect,</b> <b>as</b> <b>regards</b> residual tissue preservation, masticatory muscle activity {{and quality of the}} life. MethodsEight patients were selected form Prosthodontic Clinic of the Faculty of Dentistry, Tanta University with palatomaxillary defects. The conventional hollow type obturator was fabricated for each patient. After 6 months of obturator insertion, each patient received tapered threaded implant at the Zygomatic bone of the resected side. During Osseointegration period, all patients continued using the conventional hollow obturators. After another 6 months the obturator was connected to the implant by ball and socket attachment. Clinical and radiographic evaluation of the abutment teeth in addition to Electromyographic evaluation of masseter and temporalis muscles and assessment of the oral health related quality of life were done. ResultsFor the abutment teeth, there was no statistically significant difference in gingival index, tooth mobility, and bone level in comparison between conventional obturator and implant retained obturator. Implant retained obturator showed significant improvement over conventional obturator in patient quality of life. In addition, increase of muscle activity of the masseter and temporalis muscles in patients with implant retained obturator was recorded. ConclusionThe implant retained obturator highly improved the masticatory function and Oral Health Related Quality of Life (OHRQOL) in comparison to conventional obturator...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the ϕ 4 kink {{scattering}} from a spatially localized PT-symmetric defect {{and the effect}} of the kink’s internal mode (IM) is discussed. It is demonstrated that if a kink hits the defect from the gain side, a noticeable IM is excited, while for the kink coming from the opposite direction the mode excitation is much weaker. This asymmetry is a principal finding of the present work. Similar to the case of the sine-Gordon kink studied earlier, it is found that the ϕ 4 kink approaching the defect from the gain side always passes through the defect, while in the opposite case it must have sufficiently large initial velocity, otherwise it is trapped by the loss region. It is found that for the kink with IM the critical velocity is smaller, meaning that the kink bearing IM can pass more easily through the loss region. This feature, namely the “increased transparency” of the <b>defect</b> <b>as</b> <b>regards</b> the motion of the kink in the presence of IM is the second key finding of the present work. A two degree of freedom collective variable model offered recently by one of the co-authors is shown to be capable of reproducing both principal findings of the present work. A simpler, analytically tractable single degree of freedom collective variable method is used to calculate analytically the kink phase shift and the kink critical velocity sufficient to pass through the defect. Comparison with the numerical results suggests that the collective variable method is able to predict these parameters with a high accuracy...|$|R

40|$|Thermomechanical {{coupling}} {{and thermal}} softening are the critical material {{properties in the}} development of adiabatic shear bands. Besides the material effects, the sample geometrical imperfections and the material structural <b>defects</b> are <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> providing the sites for the onset of the localization process. In this paper, the influence of the shape and size of the imperfections on the localization of the plastic flow in simple shear are analyzed within the framework of a nonlinear model : localization criteria are given in which the sharpness of the defects modulates the rheological effects. It is shown that, more than their size, the sharpness of the local imperfections may help to explain the observed scatter in the nominal failure deformation...|$|R
40|$|Hyaline {{articular}} cartilage {{does not show}} a significant self healing potential and so cartilage damage cannot be currently healed. For these reasons cartilage damage generally progresses to osteoarthritis. Over the years many conservative and surgical methods {{have been developed for}} the treatment of knee joint cartilage damage. This indicates that an optimal therapy has not yet been found. In the best case these therapies result in hyaline-like cartilages, however, in most cases fibrous cartilage or cicatricial tissue develops. In the long term this regenerated tissue is not able to withstand the heavy loads dominant in the joint and therefore degenerates. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine the influence of the limiting mechanical factors of osteochondral implants on the reconstruction of the subchondral bone and cartilage. This study of different therapeutical approaches of osteochondral defects should reflect the connection between the different rigidities of the implants and the immunohistochemical, histologic and histomorphometric healing outcomes. An osteochondral defect was induced on the lateral and medial condyle of the left knee joint in 24 merino-mix sheep. One defect remained untreated and served as a control while the others were treated with various implants. The reference group was treated with an autologous osteochondral graft. Special attention was directed toward the connection between structural and mechanical influences of the subchondral defect filling and the healing outcomes. In the second group the defect was filled with cancellous bone clusters and covered with a collagen membrane. The defects of the other two groups were treated with biodegradable polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) scaffolds with different mechanical rigidity. The postoperative healing period amounted to twelve weeks. The femora were removed post mortem and the control defects, the filled defects and the native condyles were analyzed and evaluated immunohistochemically, histologically and histomorphometrically. The results showed that after twelve weeks the recovery procedure with the autologous osteochondral cylinder was superior to the other three operation methods. A retarded and unsatisfactory regeneration was observed in the autologous cancellous bone group. Up to the time of the examination the defect was only filled with connective tissue, a result that was similar to that of the control group. The scaffold groups showed integration in the edges of the bone and cartilage area. The scaffold group, with a 84 % rigidity in relation to a healthy ovine subchondral bone, exhibited slightly better healing results than the scaffold group with only 58 % rigidity. It seems that after twelve weeks a different subchondral treatment in relation to the structure and rigidity influences the regeneration process of osteochondral <b>defects</b> <b>as</b> <b>regards</b> to the amount of tissue, the speed and also the quality of the regenerated material...|$|R
40|$|The WIC-Hyd rat is a mutant {{from the}} Csk: Wistar-Imamichi rat, with {{spontaneous}} hydrocephalus. In male rats, the hydrocephalus is severe and about {{one half of}} hydrocephalic male littermates possess situs inversus totalis. Ependymal cilia in these animals are immotile, and this <b>defect</b> is <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> a mechanical cause of hydrocephalus. This paper presents the ultrastructural features of respiratory cilia in these rats in comparison with those in human immotile cilia syndrome. The respiratory cilia in these rats also are immotile and the dynein arms are missing, as in human cases. Previously only eight dogs with immotile cilia syndrome and a mutant hydrocephalic-polydactyl mouse were reported with respect to these phenomena. However the WIC-Hyd rat is the first useful animal model for human immotile cilia syndrome, and further studies may serve to clarify the genetic background of this condition...|$|R
40|$|Surface <b>defect</b> is <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> one {{critical}} factor that affects magnetic properties of magnetic microwires. However, current imaging techniques only allow to observe samples from one fixed direction, and thereby most of surface defects on microwire cannot be detected. Herein, we firstly develop a miniature rotatable robot inside {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM) and propose a relevant control strategy to align the microwire onto the rotation axis of the robot. After that, the microwire is rotated continuously by 360 o and all the surface defects on the microwire are observed from different directions successfully. Multidirectional observation results {{can be used to}} located heating inhomogeneity, which is the main cause of defects. Magnetic measurement results show that the effect of defects on domain wall (DW) should be considered in device design. This research provides the direct evidence for surface defects’ distribution and effect, which can be adopted to provide guidance for improving magnetic wire’s fabrication process and designing logic circuits made from those magnetic wires...|$|R

The paper discusses the objective of software defect management, the definition of defect ranking, the process of tracking defect management, and illustrates it with combining the Lotus Notes/Domino localized defect management. The objectives of defect tracking management The goal of defect tracking aims to track the software defect from it happened to the time it modified and distributed. It could strengthen to control the process of defect modification; it is a main approach to control the quality of defect modification. The data raised from the defect tracking is thought to be the foundation of analyzing the reasons of defects. The implement of defect tracking depends on the corresponding the software realization and the design of process. The defect tracking techniques actually are the workflow applied into defect modification, it could be evaluated the results of defect tracking quality by utilizing the four indexes of workflow, including time, cost, fidelity, reliability...|$|R

In this study, Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains with different capacities to consume substrates present in wheat were selected to investigate the impact of substrate limitation on dough fermentation and final bread volume. Results show that fermentation of dough with maltose-negative strains relies {{on the presence of}} fructan and sucrose as fermentable substrates and can be used for regular bread making. Levels of fructan and sucrose, endogenously present or added, hence determine the extent of fermentation and timing at the proofing stage.
