5|$|Thyroid hormone is {{required}} for the normal functioning of numerous tissues in the body. In health, the thyroid gland predominantly secretes thyroxine (T4), which is converted into triiodothyronine (T3) in other organs by the selenium-dependent enzyme <b>iodothyronine</b> deiodinase. Triiodothyronine binds to the thyroid hormone receptor in the nucleus of cells, where it stimulates the turning on of particular genes and the production of specific proteins. Additionally, the hormone binds to integrin αvβ3 on the cell membrane, thereby stimulating the sodium–hydrogen antiporter and processes such as formation of blood vessels and cell growth. In blood, almost all thyroid hormone (99.97%) is bound to plasma proteins such as thyroxine-binding globulin; only the free unbound thyroid hormone is biologically active.|$|E

In this work, an in vitro model of cultured rat hepatocytes mimicking a mild steatosis condition was used to investigate the direct lipid-lowering action of <b>iodothyronines,</b> by focusing, in particular, on LD-associated proteins, FFA oxidation and lipid secretion.

At physiological pH, dissociation of the phenolic -OH group of these <b>iodothyronines</b> is an important determinant of their physical chemistry that impacts on their biological effects. When non-ionized these <b>iodothyronines</b> are strongly amphipathic. It is proposed that <b>iodothyronines</b> are normal constituents of biological membranes in vertebrates. In plasma of adult vertebrates, unbound T 4 and T 3 are regulated in the picomolar range whilst protein-bound T 4 and T 3 are maintained in the nanomolar range. The function of thyroid-hormone-binding plasma proteins is to ensure an even distribution throughout the body. Various <b>iodothyronines</b> are produced by three types of membrane-bound cellular deiodinase enzyme systems in vertebrates. The distribution of deiodinases varies between tissues and each has a distinct developmental profile. Thyroid hormones have many effects in vertebrates. It is proposed that there are several modes of action of these hormones. (1) The nuclear receptor mode is especially important in the thyroid hormone axis that controls plasma and cellular levels of these hormones. (2) These hormones are strongly associated with membranes in tissues and normally rigidify these membranes. (3) They also affect the acyl composition of membrane bilayers and {{it is suggested that}} {{this is due to the}} cells responding to thyroid-hormone-induced membrane rigidification. Both their immediate effects on the physical state of membranes and the consequent changes in membrane composition result in several other thyroid hormone effects. Effects on metabolism may be due primarily to membrane acyl changes. There are other actions of thyroid hormones involving membrane receptors and influences on cellular interactions with the extracellular matrix. The effects of thyroid hormones are reviewed and appear to be combinations of these various modes of action. During development, vertebrates show a surge in T 4 and other thyroid hormones, as well as distinctive profiles in the appearance of the deiodinase enzymes and nuclear receptors. Evidence from the use of analogues supports multiple modes of action. Re-examination of data from the early 1960 s supports a membrane action. Findings from receptor 2 ̆ 7 knockout 2 ̆ 7 mice supports an important role for receptors in the development of the thyroid axis.
