40|$|Large-scale {{arrays of}} {{microwave}} kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs) are attractive candidates {{for use in}} imaging instruments for next generation submillimeter-wave telescopes such as CCAT. We have designed and fabricated tightly packed ~ 250 -pixel MKID arrays using lumped-element resonators etched from {{a thin layer of}} superconducting TiN_x deposited on a silicon substrate. The high pixel packing density in our initial design resulted in large microwave crosstalk due to electromagnetic coupling between the resonators. Our second design eliminates this problem by adding a <b>grounding</b> <b>shield</b> and using a double-wound geometry for the meander inductor to allow conductors with opposite polarity to be in close proximity. In addition, the resonator frequencies are distributed in a checkerboard pattern across the array. We present details for the two resonator and array designs and describe a circuit model for the full array that predicts the distribution of resonator frequencies and the crosstalk level. We also show results from a new experimental technique that conveniently measures crosstalk without the need for an optical setup. Our results reveal an improvement in crosstalk from 57 % in the initial design down to ≤ 2 % in the second design. The general procedure and design guidelines in this work are applicable to future large arrays employing microwave resonators...|$|E

Degradation of the quality factor, Q, due to substrate effects has been studied [2]. In addition, the problem of signal coupling via the substrate in RF circuits has been reported [3]. As inductors occupy substantial area, it is critical to suppress the coupling between the inductors and the substrate.

The maximum avail-able gain is {{used to evaluate the}} quality of transformers similarly to that of active devices. The silicon substrate has a pronounced effect on the quality factor and mutual resistive coupling factor of the primary and secondary coils, thereby degrading the maximum available gain of the transformer. A highly structured patterned <b>ground</b> <b>shield</b> is shown to improve the maximum available gain of a transformer at high frequencies, while at low frequencies, it has little effect on the maximum available gain and even degrades the quality factors of the transformer coils.

The simulations {{of the proposed}} topology are carried out at different power consumptions at 430 MHz and the simulation results concluded that {{the performance of the}} topology is very impressive at low power consumptions. The amplifier provides a forward gain of 14 dB with a noise figure of 1. 62 dB while drawing 30 mW from 3 V supply and 10 dB forward gain with a noise figure of 2 dB while drawing 6 mW from 1. 5 V supply at 430 MHz.
