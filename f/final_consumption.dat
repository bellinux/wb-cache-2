5|$|In 2010, the International Resource Panel, {{hosted by}} the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), {{published}} the first global scientific assessment on the impacts of consumption and production and identified priority actions for developed and developing countries. The {{study found that the}} most critical impacts are related to ecosystem health, human health and resource depletion. From a production perspective, it found that fossil-fuel combustion processes, agriculture and fisheries have the most important impacts. Meanwhile, from a <b>final</b> <b>consumption</b> perspective, it found that household consumption related to mobility, shelter, food and energy-using products cause the majority of life-cycle impacts of consumption.|$|E
25|$|Mexico has set {{a minimum}} goal of clean {{energies}} {{as part of the}} electric power generation mix in for the next years (25% in 2018, 30% in 2021 and 35% in 2024) as a strategy to reach Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emission cuts. Energy efficiency is also {{regarded as one of the}} greater cost-benefit potential alternatives to achieve GHG reduction. Moreover, the transport sector in Mexico represents 44.7% of the total <b>final</b> <b>consumption</b> of energy, almost 17% more than the world average (28%). Thus, replacing low fuel efficient transport with alternative fuels is regarded as a considerable contribution to reduce 50% of its GHG emissions by the year 2050, as established by the General Law on Climate Change commitments. Therefore, incentives for PHEVs have been created both at regional and federal levels to decrease cost of ownership for the end-consumers.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the trends}} of <b>final</b> energy <b>consumption</b> in Latvia and Czech Republic. Analysis of <b>final</b> energy <b>consumption</b> during 2000 - 2013 period indicated the main driving forces of <b>final</b> energy <b>consumption</b> {{during and after}} world financial crisis of 2008. The paper aimed to evaluate the impact of economic activity and other factors on <b>final</b> energy <b>consumption.</b> The decomposition of the <b>final</b> energy <b>consumption</b> is assessed by analyzing effect of different drivers by the main end-users sector (industry, transport, households, agriculture, services), activity, demography, lifestyles, structural effects, energy savings etc. The {{results show that the}} reduction in <b>final</b> energy <b>consumption</b> in most EU memb ers states before and after year 2008 can be related to the decline in energy intensities within end - users sectors. At the same time, the increase in final energy intensity after the year 2008 is attributed to expansion of energy demand sectors. Comparison of <b>final</b> energy <b>consumption</b> trends and drivers in Latvia and Czech Republic indicated that Czech Republic implemented more policies and measures in industry and tertiary sector and this provided for <b>final</b> energy <b>consumption</b> decreased and huge energy savings in these sectors...|$|R

2500|$|The world’s total <b>final</b> <b>consumption</b> {{of energy}} by sector {{represented}} 9,426 Million Tonnes of Oil Equivalent (Mtoe) in 2014, 28% {{of which is}} attributed to transport alone, accounting for an increase of 5% from 1971 statistics. Moreover, 23% of energy-related Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions worldwide are also attributable to transport. Thus, the electrification of the transport sector represents an area of opportunity for governments to cut their GHG emissions, {{which is why they}} are starting to champion policies that increase plug-in hybrid electric vehicles adoption rates.|$|E

60|$|The labor(102) which terminates in the {{production}} of an article fitted for some human use is either employed directly about the thing, or in previous operations destined to facilitate, perhaps essential to the possibility of, the subsequent ones. In making bread, for example, the labor employed about the thing itself is that of the baker; but the labor of the miller, though employed directly in {{the production}} not of bread but of flour, is equally part of the aggregate sum of labor by which the bread is produced; as is also the labor of the sower, and of the reaper. Some may think that all these persons ought to be considered as employing their labor directly about the thing; the corn, the flour, and the bread being one substance in three different states. Without disputing about this question of mere language, there is still the plowman, who prepared the ground for the seed, and whose labor never came in contact with the substance in any of its states; and the plow-maker, whose share in the result was still more remote. We must add yet another kind of labor; that of transporting the produce from the place of its production to the place of its destined use: the labor of carrying the corn to market, and from market to the miller’s, the flour from the miller’s to the baker’s, and the bread from the baker’s to the place of its <b>final</b> <b>consumption.</b>|$|E
40|$|This report aims at {{showing the}} present status of energy {{consumption}} in the EU- 28, in the four main energy consuming sectors: residential, tertiary, transport and industry. During the last years, there have been efforts by the European Union {{to cut down on}} energy consumption and improve energy efficiency. From 2000 to 2014, there have been various initiatives that aim at reducing <b>final</b> energy <b>consumption.</b> Therefore, the report demonstrates the energy consumption progress from 2000 to 2014 in the mentioned four sectors: •	The EU <b>final</b> energy <b>consumption</b> registered the lowest value over the period from 2000 to 2014 in 2014. Per first time the EU <b>final</b> energy <b>consumption</b> is below the EU energy targets for 2020. •	Energy indicators such as energy intensity and energy consumption per capita have reduced, turning the EU into a more competitive actor. •	Four EU Member States (i. e. Germany, France, United Kingdom and Italy) consumed over 50 % of the <b>final</b> energy <b>consumption</b> and fourteen EU Member States consumed more than 90 % of the total <b>final</b> energy <b>consumption</b> in 2014.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{quantify}} the total Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from different commodities, the contribution of emissions in all subprocess chains has to be considered. In embedded energy analysis, the higher order production processes are usually truncated {{due to a lack}} of data. To fill the truncated subprocesses up to infinite process chains, energy intensities and GHG emission factors of various <b>final</b> <b>consumptions</b> in the economy evaluated by the Input-Output Analysis (IOA) must be applied. The direct GHG emissions in <b>final</b> <b>consumptions</b> in Thailand are evaluated by imitating the approach in the energy sector of the revised 1996 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines for national GHG inventories. The indirect energy and indirect emissions are evaluated by using the 1998 Input-Output (I-O) table. Results are presented of emissions in the main process, indirect processes, and on each subprocess chain order. The trend of energy intensity and emission factors of all <b>final</b> <b>consumptions</b> for 1995, 1998, 2001 and 2006 are also presented. Results show that the highest energy intensive sector is the electricity sector where fossil fuel is primarily used, but the highest total GHG emitter is the cement industry where the major sources of the emissions are industrial processes and the combustion of fossil fuels. Implication of the emission factors on electricity generating technologies shows that various cleaner electricity generating technologies, including renewable energy technology, could help in global GHG mitigation.
