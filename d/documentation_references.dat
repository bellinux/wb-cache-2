The problem is complicated by the presence of other robots or obstacles in the workspace as in addition to the collision avoidance with the obstacles, the robots have to avoid the collision with the moving robots. For multiple robots, this problem is approached using some combination of two or more different techniques e. g. visibility graph, voronoi diagram, probabilistic roadmaps, which are used for solving the problem for single robot situations. When we look at how the humans move in groups, we find that broadly we can classify the group motions into guarding, escorting, chasing. In this project, we tried to simulated some of these human group behaviors. Back to Top METHODOLOGY We have used a distributed approach for planning the motio...|$|E

40|$|Documentary {{linguistics}} for endangered languages emphasizes {{primary data}} - recordings and representation of linguistic events - and {{audio and video}} recordings are a priority for both fieldwork and for archiving because those events are unlikely to occur into the future. Audio is the focal component of our primary data. While video offers much promise, it is by definition less close to the principal concerns of documenting (spoken) languages, and introduces many costs. Recent debates about the motivations for and value of video have raised valuable questions such as: What/who is it for? What makes a good recording? How can we figure the documentation value? What aspects of events are captured/not captured? But these questions, in turn (and some of the arguments for video), when applied to audio, reveal that we have tended to take audio for granted; at worst (and frequently enough), audio is simply an inconvenience {{on the way to}} creating symbolic representations such as transcriptions and analyses. Up till now, there have been some developments, such as increasing the accountability of analyses by providing direct links to "primary audio data", and tools built to support this such as Thieberger's Audiamus. But these on their own are not enough; they do not challenge audio's emasculated status as evidence rather than performance. Finnegan (2008), for example, has recently pointed out the almost unbounded richness of audio phenomena in linguistic performance, for which we don't have a vocabulary nor even recognition that without such a framework we are effectively hiding these phenomena from research. And we have been reminded (by Dietrich Schueller) that linguistics is one of the least scientific of disciplines when it comes to audio data collection. This paper considers audio from several perspectives, including documentary linguistics, experiences in training young documenters, information theory, and acoustics, to propose an epistemology for audio within documentation that surpasses descriptors such as formats and resolutions, and restores criteria such as informativeness, replicability, and representational validity for audio in language <b>documentation.</b> <b>References</b> Finnegan, R. 2008.

The key finding in this overall research: As an artist, {{it is possible to}} visualize and perceive phenomena in the ocean environment as though seeing it for the first time, as an assemblage of ‘base processes’ that describe the underlying workings of nature. Further to this, during my field research I witnessed impacts of climate change. It is envisaged that climate change will increasingly degrade the ocean environment. This finding is demonstrated through my ‘sculptural assemblages’. I extend the parameters of sculptural ceramic practice. ‘Sculptural assemblage’ refers to my installation practice, that includes ceramics, mixed media, video and spatial concepts. This methodology offers the viewer a visual, physical, conceptual, and tactile experience. The three core areas in this research investigation are: sculptural form, material qualities and ‘climate change’ concepts. This is an art practice led research project. Exegesis documentation outlines field research investigations and studio explorations. Field research is my fundamental research methodology to investigate ‘base processes’. This approach offers: first–hand observation and knowledge, spatial perceptions, and close–up visualization of physical and intangible phenomena. My research focuses on underwater reefs, intertidal zones, icebergs and glacial environments. Ocean phenomena are mostly investigated through their movements rather than their stationary appearance. Changeable ocean processes and phenomena are observed, imaged and made concrete through ‘sculptural assemblages’. As part of research into ‘base processes’, I examine the interactions between water, earth, fire and air as foundational elements of life. This is interpreted through clay and glaze materials that are transformed through studio ‘making’ and firing processes into a tangible expression of ‘base processes’. My artworks celebrate the wonder of the ocean environment, but also draw attention to impacts from ocean acidification, coral bleaching and global warming and to the bio–diversity that may be lost. Transformational states represented through my sculptural forms imply natural processes that have gone awry due to climate change.

40|$|For some {{languages}} {{with complex}} inflectional morphology, linguists have proposed morphological templates {{to account for}} regularities in the forms and orders in which morphemes appear (Good 2011, McDonough 2000, Rice 2000). From a linguistic perspective, templates provide a layer of abstraction over word structure, representing recurring inflectional patterns as sequences of underlying morphemes and accompanying morphophonemic adaptations. From a pedagogical perspective, morphological templates offer both advantages and disadvantages. While bringing attention to meaningful parts of complex words, their level of abstraction is not always learner-friendly. In many cases, teachers and learners of templatically-analyzed languages face a dilemma. Abandoning templates leaves few resources that highlight commonalities between word-forms, encouraging rote memorization and lessening emphasis on productive language use. On the other hand, adopting templatic representations can prove difficult for both learners' production and comprehension. One alternative to morphological templates is found in paradigms which group together sets of related words in their fully-inflected forms. This surface-oriented approach to words and the regularities among them has several benefits for language pedagogy and documentation: 1. Paradigms present a means of representing regularities across words that does not require deep morphological analysis. Such sets of whole-word forms can help organize observations about recurring inflectional patterns without tremendous abstraction, making such information more accessible for language learning and teaching; 2. Paradigms provide support for adapting existing language resources for use in new teaching contexts. For instance, drawing on paradigms with the necessary inflectional forms, third-person narratives (e. g., storybooks) can be adapted into first and second-person response routines {{that can be used}} as language activities; 3. For L 2 teaching methods that emphasize the repetition of constructions across multiple contexts of use, paradigms can help in finding words that ‘fit’ inflectionally in the given frames, making reinforcement teaching methods easier to implement. With this in mind, this paper considers how paradigmatic approaches to word structure may benefit both language pedagogy and documentation. Drawing examples from Dene (Athapaskan) languages, which are often upheld as prototypical examples of templatic verbal morphology, this paper assesses the viability of paradigm-based approaches to inflection in these languages. It then proceeds to consider how these approaches are being applied in pedagogical resource development, L 2 teaching, and documentation. Based on these observations, this paper argues that surface-based approaches are not only feasible, but have a valuable role to play in language teaching and <b>documentation.</b> <b>REFERENCES</b> Good, Jeff. 2011.

40|$|Poster. Colloque avec actes et comité de lecture. internationale. International audiencePoster {{abstract}} [...] Introduction ==The {{availability of}} complete genome sequences from many species allows to apply {{new approaches to}} characterizing particular genetic patterns. Thanks to bioinformatic tools, the whole genome sequences {{can be used to}} study the biology of pathogenic bacteria or genetic human diseases. Tandem repeats are contiguously repeated copies of the same nucleotide pattern. The increasing variety of such repeats that have been found through genome projects reveals that repeated DNA is by no means "junk DNA" but clearly involved in regulating gene expression. Minisatellites, a class of tandem repeats, have been shown to cause diseases by influencing gene expression, modifying coding sequences within genes or generating fragile sites. This is thought to happen in the case of triplet repeat diseases, such as Huntington's disease, which are caused by a bigger number of pattern copies in repeats located within specific genes. Many prokaryotic genomes contain various types of repeated DNA occurring in genes, in intergenic sequences, or in transposable elements. Repeats, such as long repeats, are representative of important evolutionary mechanisms that allow bacteria to quickly adapt to environmental changes. Indeed, many pathogens have developed the ability to alter surface-exposed molecules, most often in response to selective pressure associated with the host immune system. Thus, bacteria present very diverse evolutionary strategies linked to pathogenesis. One of these genetic mechanisms involves a change in the number of repeated patterns, which causes phenotype variation. The polymorphic character of repeats make them useful as DNA markers for mapping genomes that is an important approach for linkage analysis, which can be used to search for genes involved {{in a wide range of}} disorders. This shows the relative precision with which genome sequences can be used to investigate genetic diseases. Results ======= mreps is a computer program for exhaustively characterizing all tandem repeats in a given DNA sequence. The distribution, some <b>documentation,</b> <b>references,</b> and other related information are available at [URL] mreps implements combinatorial algorithms: it finds all repetitions which verify the user specification and does not refer to any statistical model or an heuristics. As a consequence, mreps does not associate any score to a repetition found. All repetitions which verify the user specification are considered a priori "equally good". mreps lets judge which repetitions are interesting :it finds them all and than the user cann sort them to any appropriate criterium. To simplify this job, mreps can output the result in xml format sa that they can be easily processed by other tools. mreps finds exact and approximate repetitions depending on the error parameter specified by the user. The current version of mreps treats only substitution errors and does not treat indels. Example ======= Applying mreps to whole genomes can readily reveal interesting repeats. As an example, we applied mreps to Neisseria meningitidis MC 58 organism, which is a causative agent of meningitidis and septicaemia. The size of its genome is 2. 24 Mband mreps revealed an exact tandem repeat of 32 Kb pattern, located in a coding region. An exact biological meaning of this repeat is still inknown. Here is the corresponding mreps output.

An {{exploration of}} the language used alongside the Process for Nutrition and Dietetic Practice (PNDP) to describe nutrition-related problemsR Lindop 1 & J McClinchy 21 Shrewsbury and Telford Hospitals Trust, The Royal Shrewsbury Hospital, Shrewsbury, UK and 2 University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield, Hertfordshire, UKBackground: The Process for Nutrition and Dietetic Practice (PNDP), based on the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetic???s Nutrition Care Process (NCP) 1, provides a systematic approach to patient-centred care with emphasis on formulating a ???Nutrition Diagnosis??? (ND). Unlike the American NCP, a standardised language has not been formally adopted for use alongside the PNDP in the UK. The British Dietetic Association (BDA) have however recently introduced UK-focused nutrition diagnosis terms (NDT) for nutrition-related problems 2. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the use of nutrition diagnosis terms in the PAS statement. Design: A mixed methods design was chosen consisting of an audit of dietetic records and a focus group with eight registered dietitians. To facilitate group discussion across a range of patients and to enable standardisation of the audit tool, participants identified three dietetic record cards of current patients with type 2 diabetes. Twenty four NDs were audited from the anonymised dietetic patient records. The audit-tool was designed to measure the inclusion and accuracy of the problem, aetiology and signs and symptoms within each PAS statement, with the International Dietetics and Nutrition Terminology (IDNT) 1 forming the standard for accuracy. Data from the audit also helped formulate the topic guide which explored the dietitians??? experiences of using the PNDP and their views about IDNT and NDT. The focus group was recorded and transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis. Ethical approval was given by the University of Hertfordshire Ethics committee. Results: Just two of 24 NDs were accurate when compared to IDNT standards. Emergent themes of ???Being an autonomous practitioner???; ???Finding using the nutrition diagnosis challenging???; and ???Considerations for standardised nutrition diagnoses??? demonstrated deeper meaning: While the dietitians valued the ND for working as autonomous practitioners, qualitative investigation highlighted a poor understanding for effective application amongst some participants. Barriers preventing the correct application of, and more negative attitudes towards the ND appeared to arise where there was a poorer understanding of the PAS statement and difference between the medical and nutrition diagnosis. Most participants found the American standardised language impractical and longwinded, preferring unambiguous and concise characteristics for standardised NDs. Although they agreed the BDA???s NDT fitted this description, the participants were currently unaware of the NDTs development. Discussion: The results suggest that a flexible approach is being taken towards the use of the ND. In line with previous research, participants with a good knowledge of the PAS statement tended to display more positive feelings towards its use 3. To support the use of the ND, the BDA could provide tools to help implementation, utilise dietetic experiences of ND application through continued research, and incorporate marketing and promotion to raise awareness of their new NDT. Conclusion: The link between knowledge and positive approach towards the ND demonstrates a need for further education regarding the application of PAS statements, and suggests a benefit of introducing a UK-focused standardised language for nutrition related problems to promote uniformity of <b>documentation.</b> <b>References</b> 1.

40|$|Slides {{given at}} the #lingtyp Association for Linguistic Typology session on Australian languages. Standard Average Australian? Claire Bowern, Yale University There {{has long been a}} {{tradition}} in the descriptive literature on Australian languages to refer to a core of common features: that is, to describe the grammar of a language {{in terms of what we}} might call “Standard Average Australian. ” Works such as Wurm (1972) and Dixon (2002) have established generalized notions about the features of Australian phonol- ogy, morphology, syntax, and semantics that have continued to inform both the practices and priorities of the descriptive Australianist literature, particularly for Pama-Nyungan, the largest family on the continent. It is not uncommon to find examples such as those given in (1). (1) a. b. c. “Mantjiltjara, along with other languages of the Wati subgroup, has a great concen- tration of Common Australian characteristics” (Marsh 1976 : 11); “Word order is remarkably free in most Australian languages. ” (Dixon 1979 : 435); “Use of the root ’big’ for ’mother’ is widespread in Australian languages” (Evans 1990 : 163) Methodologically, Australian grammatical descriptions tend to emphasise the unity and homogeneity of languages. The idea of an average or typical Australian language can also be seen in grammatical descriptions where the author claims that the language represents prototypical exemplars of the Australian continent, as exemplified in (2). (2) a. b. c. d. Yidiny: phonology (Dixon 1977 : 1); Kayardild: phonology (Evans 1995 : 585); Dyirbal: general morphological type (Blake 1976); Gooniyandi: stance verbs as existential predicates (McGregor 1990 : 396) Yet even those with a cursory knowledge of Australian languages will recognize substan- tial differences between all these languages claimed to be ‘typical’. Yidiny’s and Kayardild’s phonological similarities, for example, do not even extend to inventory. In recent years, some authors have questioned the implicit uniformity assumed and emphasised by much earlier work (see, e. g. Nordlinger 2006). In such a spirit, this paper evaluates the claims of homogeneity made throughout the literature. We collect such claims by combing grammars for phrases such as “As in many Australian languages... ” (and, conversely, “... rare for Australian languages... ”). The goals of this study are three: (i) to inform, adjust, or debunk prior claims about Standard Average Australian; (ii) to identify potential unconsidered widespread features; and (iii) to highlight problems of ‘confirmation bias’ in grammatical description. At stake are the continued ac- curacy of new research in these languages and a proper understanding of what Australian languages bring to regional and worldwide cross-linguistic studies. I test 70 claims in phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics. For the clear majority of cases, the claim is either incorrect at face value or misleading. For example, most claims about the structure of numeral systems (as universally lacking concepts beyond three, or where numerals ‘three’ and above have obligatory reference) are simply false, as shown by the summary of Bowern and Zentz (2012). Claims about semantics require further testing too. For example, Evans’ claim in (1) above cannot be substantiated outside of Eastern Arn- hem Land with current data. Another example comes from word lengths. According to Dixon (2002 : 553), “most Australian languages have no monosyllabic words at all (outsideinterjections). Others show a few... ” Yet Gasser and Bowern (2014) found that nearly half the languages (48 %) in the sample had robustly attested monosyllabic words. Other claims are, if not incorrect, misleading, relying as they do on a definition of ‘many’ or ‘widespread’. As an example, consider the claim that ‘[m]ultilevel case marking is widespread in Australian languages’ (Dench and Evans 1988 : 1). There are 20 languages out of a sample of 100 (where sufficient data were available), where case stacking such as in (3) is found. (3) Wuraal, kartu nhawungarra-ma-rninyji nganaju-u muyi-i? all. right, 2 SG. NOM look. after-CAUS-FUT 1 SG. GEN-ACC dog-ACC “Can you look after my dog?” (Dench 1995 : 80) These languages, with a few exceptions, are clustered in the Pilbara and a region from the Gulf of Carpentaria south into central Australia. Calling such a phenomenon ‘widespread’, when similarly commonly attested and more evenly distributed phenomena (such as pres- ence of contrastive fricatives in the phoneme inventory) are labeled ‘rare’ (cf. Blevins 2001 : 44), highlights problems with descriptive methodology. To be sure, some early generalisations were based on inadequate descriptions. However, I argue that the continued emphasis on uniformity of Australian languages is counterproductive to typology at best, and at worst a type of confirmation bias that damages prospects for high quality language <b>documentation.</b> <b>References</b> Blake, Barry. 1976.
