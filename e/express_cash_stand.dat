40|$|The {{interest}} coverage ratios (ICRs) {{are used}} to quantify the ability of firms to pay financial debts; ICRs are then considered by banks such as covenants in the financing term sheet, and are used by researchers and the rating agencies to estimate the probability of default of firms. Typically, ICRs calculation is based on profit margins, such as EBITDA and EBIT; EBITDA and EBIT approximate, but do not directly <b>express,</b> <b>cash</b> flows available to pay financial debts. The article aims to evaluate whether there are significant differences in results using ICRs based on EBITDA or EBIT and ICRs based on different definitions of cash flow (CF). The application is made {{to a sample of}} firms characterized by high absorption of capital operating in the Italian agro-food sector. The article highlights that there are statistically significant differences using ICRs EBITDA and EBIT based and ICRs based on different CF definitions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between financing constraints and investment-cash flow sensitivities by focusing on cash holdings of firms as the basic classification scheme to separate firms into financially constrained and unconstrained categories. The idea is that high cash reserves increase the ability of firms to undertake profitable investment opportunities. Our classification scheme {{is based on an}} optimal cash model, which helps us identify the firms that deviate significantly from their target cash ratio. We conduct the analysis for an emerging market, just before and during a financial crisis to test the hypothesis that the hedging role of cash is more critical in states of the world characterized by high asymmetric information and excessive costs of external finance. The results are in line with our expectations and show that constrained firms exhibit greater investment to cash flow sensitivities than unconstrained firms. Also, there is strong evidence that <b>cash</b> <b>stands</b> as an effective device for firms mainly, during the crisis period.

40|$|Limited {{development}} {{offers the}} hope of turning market development pressure which threatens open land into a means for financing its protection. In theory, the profit from developing {{a small portion of}} a parcel can be used to subsidize the protection of the remainder. This thesis critically examines the financial, institutional, and agricultural effectiveness of limited development as a tool for protecting farmland. An alternative accounting methodology is proposed which <b>expresses</b> <b>cash</b> flows as sources and uses of subsidies for the support of non-market land uses, allowing comparison of limited development and traditional tools for financing land conservation. The model also attempts {{to determine the extent to}} which limited development profits are due to enhancement of development land value by the restriction of adjacent open space, market appreciation in real estate prices, and deal-making and subdivision of land. The model assumes the perspective of a non-profit limited developer. The model is then applied to three Massachusetts case studies of farmland preservation through limited development. The agricultural viability of the protected farmland is briefly examined in each case study. The thesis concludes that limited development often provides only a minor supplement to public subsidy programs and private contributions in the protection of farmland, although it can supply significant subsidies in some cases. Furthermore, limited development can put a non-profit into the awkward and risky role of a for-profit developer. Agriculturally, limited development leaves small farm parcels adjacent to residential use. While not ideal, such a pattern is typical of metropolitan areas, and one to which some farmers have successfully adapted. by William D. Tuttle, III. Thesis (M. S.)

30|$|Further {{research}} by (Bianchetti, 2010) confirms the market practice is now that of using two curves to obtain no-arbitrage solutions.

This solution uses an analogy to the cross-currency derivative pricing method in which an adjustment is needed to <b>express</b> the discounted <b>cash</b> flows under different rates.|$|R
