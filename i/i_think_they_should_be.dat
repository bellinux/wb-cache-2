500|$|Barrett, by the {{beginning}} of the recording sessions for A Saucerful of Secrets, was already shrinking into a delirious state of mind, exacerbated by his feelings of alienation from the rest of the band. The common interpretation of the lyrics is that they reflect his schizophrenia and it has been argued that they could also be read as a criticism of the other band members for forcing him out. King said of the song: [...] "The most alienated, extraordinary lyrics. It's not addressed to the band, it's addressed to the whole world. He was completely cut off." [...] Jenner said [...] "I think every psychiatrist should be made to listen to those songs [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> part of the curriculum of every medical college along with those Van Gogh paintings like The Crows." ...|$|E
2500|$|The other {{threat to}} the {{security}} of our tradition, I believe, lies at home. It is the current fear of radical ideas and of people who propound them. I do not agree with the extremists of either the left or the right, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> allowed to speak and to publish, both because they themselves have, and ought to have, rights, and once their rights are gone, the rights {{of the rest of us}} are hardly safe … ...|$|E

2500|$|Bishop lectured {{in higher}} {{education}} {{for a number of}} years starting in the 1970s when her inheritance began to run out. For a short time she taught at the University of Washington, before teaching at Harvard University for seven years. She often spent her summers in her summer house in the island community of North Haven, Maine. She taught at New York University, before finishing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

[...] I've said from day one I'm going to do things the way <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> done. There were those who said, `If you don't cheat, you're pretty naive.

2500|$|At the 2011 CPAC, {{during her}} question-and-answer segment, Coulter {{was asked about}} GOProud and the {{controversy}} over their exclusion from the 2011 CPAC. She boasted how she talked GOProud into dropping its support for same-sex marriage in the party's platform, saying, [...] "The left is trying to co-opt gays, and I don't think we should let them. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> on our side," [...] and [...] "Gays are natural conservatives." [...] Later that year, Coulter joined advisory board for GOProud.

2500|$|When asked, Mr Mortimer replied with, [...] "We have no complaints, {{they did}} a great job for us. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> have got {{themselves}} involved a lot earlier than they did but bottom line is they got there and we're out." ...|$|R
5000|$|This {{critique}} {{is analogous}} to the critique of Anselm's ontological argument by Gaunilo: [...] "Just because I can imagine a perfect island does not mean that it actually exists. Things are what they are no matter what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> be." ...|$|R
5000|$|Briggs {{sponsored}} the 1978 initiative known as Proposition 6 or the Briggs Initiative {{that would have}} prevented gays or those who supported gay rights from working in public schools.

60|$|I {{have heard}} many gentlemen among us talk {{much of the}} great {{convenience}} to {{those who live in}} the country, that they should speak Irish. It may possibly be so; but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> such who never intend to visit England, upon pain of being ridiculous; for I do not remember to have heard of any one man that spoke Irish, who had not the accent upon his tongue easily discernible to any English ear.|$|E
6000|$|... "I like {{litter of}} that sort; and if I didn't, I {{should give you}} the drawers, because I have a regard for children's little treasures, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> treated respectfully.

Here are twelve good-sized drawers, one for each month of the year, and they shall be yours as fast as you earn them, by doing the little duties that belong to you. I believe in rewards of a certain kind, {{especially}} for young folks; they help us along, and though we may begin by being good {{for the sake of the}} reward, if it is rightly used, we shall soon learn to love goodness for itself." ...|$|E

5000|$|John Milius {{claimed that}} Miramax [...] "mutilated" [...] his script. [...] "They don't {{have any sense}} of responsibility.

5000|$|... "I {{believe that}} {{children}} in this country need a more robust literary diet than they are getting....

5000|$|In one {{televised}} commentary, he said [...] "banning gays from distributing propaganda {{to children}} is not enough. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> banned from donating blood or sperm, {{and if they}} die in a car crash, their hearts should be burnt or buried in the ground as unsuitable for the continuation of life", suggesting that the internal organs of gay people should be burned and buried rather than be accepted for organ transplants.|$|E

5000|$|... "If men {{are for a}} {{long time}} {{accustomed}} only to one sort or method of thoughts, their minds grow stiff in it, and do not readily turn to another.

5000|$|It {{is clear}} from her {{acceptance}} speech for the Caldecott Medal that Cooney knew her choice of story would place demands on its young readers: [...] "I believe that children in this country need a more robust literary diet than they are getting. …It does not hurt them to read about good and evil, love and hate, life and death.

5000|$|Egoldt bootlegged 1950s rockabilly {{recordings}} in {{the early}} 1970s before starting the Rock-O-Rama mail order service, {{which was the first}} significant source for English and American punk records in Germany. The label was originally an outlet for (more or less left wing) German punk bands such as the Vomit Visions and the Razors. These early bands sang in English, which led to the following comment by John Peel, who wrote to Egoldt in May 1980: [...] "One thing about the records. Why do German singers sing in English? Is it because it is fashionable? Or is it a marketing consideration? Whichever it is, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> sing in German anyway." ...|$|R
