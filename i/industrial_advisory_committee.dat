40|$|Many {{programs}} are seeking ways to become `global'. The Aviation Technology (AT) department began this process by discussing what traits make someone `global'? How {{is a program}} shaped to produce students for whom a global perspective is second nature? Should we be trying to make students global? In response, a committee of faculty and industrial members were gathered in June 2000 to begin answering those questions. The group began by discussing what globalization meant to the industrial members. From these discussions, a Vision Goal emerged and four subset areas of further study were identified: Business Relationships, Technical, Education [...] Business and Cultural, and Regulatory. Next, a process for obtaining information {{from a number of}} locales pertinent to these subsets was laid out.

40|$|Engineering Technology {{programs}} can be greatly improved by building strong partnerships with industry. Industry partnerships are an important key element that leads to program excellence for technology-related academic programs. This type of proposition is a win-win situation for industry and university as it will greatly enhance student learning and both university and industry will benefit from this relationship. Industry can contribute toward the academic program improvement by providing regular input in terms of industry expectations of graduates, and also through active participation of the <b>industrial</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>committee</b> (IAC). Partnerships are initiated by a “memorandum of understanding ” agreement between the university and industry. Industry-university partnerships {{can serve as a}} vehicle that helps with the continuous improvement of that particular academic program. An example of this partnership is the forming of an industry advisory committee between the department and industry.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{increasingly}} competitive {{nature of}} the manufacturing industry has forced manufacturers to examine alternatives to traditional management philosophies. Although lean 2 ̆ 7 s success had been proven {{it was not uncommon}} for companies that opt to implement lean concepts to meet with mixed results and sometimes even outright failure. The {{purpose of the study was}} to investigate the relationship between organizational characteristics and issues associated with lean implementation. The study identified the following organizational characteristics (a) organizational leadership, (b) organizational culture, and (c) organizational change and examined the role each played in lean implementation efforts. The study also looked at sixteen individual (d) intrinsic organizational characteristics to determine the extent to which each impacted lean implementation efforts. The study utilized both qualitative and quantitative research tools. The qualitative component utilized both document analysis and interviews. The interviews were conducted with area business leaders who were members of the Department of Technology 2 ̆ 7 s <b>Industrial</b> <b>Advisory</b> <b>Committee</b> at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. The quantitative component utilized a separate on-line survey that was developed and administered to members of the Illinois Manufacturers 2 ̆ 7 Association. Results indicated highly capable leadership was the number one indicator of success for organizations that made the transition to lean. Other key factors included communication channels with an effective feedback system, the development of collaborative relationships between management and employees, being well versed in the practice of change management, and understanding how to effect change of cultural mores within an organization. The implications of understanding how the organizational characteristics discussed in the study affected lean implementation empowered organizations to effect change more successfully. The goal of implementing lean successfully required much more than a step by step process of implementing the lean tools in a particular order. It required a broad understanding of the things which cannot be seen; things such as, what constitutes highly capable leadership, knowing how to change the mores of organizational culture, and understanding how to overcome the barriers to successful change management. Understanding these complex relationships provided the basis upon which to advance lean implementation theory where it had been only marginally successful...|$|E

40|$|Higher Education Institutions are required, {{at least}} in some Countries, to design their {{curricula}} taking into account the needs of relevant industry. Use of <b>Industrial</b> <b>Advisory</b> <b>Committees</b> is a common way of demonstrating this input. This paper explores an additional window to industry needs through the textual analysis of job advertisements. 36 internet published adverts using the “Biomedical Engineering” search phrase were downloaded and textually analysed to identify the mentioned technical skills, generic skills and the adjectives used to describe the required level of proficiency in them. Results of the analysis of these adverts, using qualitative re-search analysis software starts to reveal a relevant technical skills hierarchy that Higher Education can use to help inform curricular designed for this employment pathway. The analy-sis of the generic skills reveals those rated important by em-ployers for different levels of jobs, again of potential use to curriculum designers. Finally the results reveal the adjectives used to show the level of ability employers seek of their gradu-ates. Herein lies a significant difference across the supply and demand side of the first employment transition. The difference can be rationally explained but does not help in closing the gap between what Higher Education provides in terms of gradu-ates and what Industry seeks. The paper concludes that dia-logue between Industry and Higher Education could usefully focus on the way skills are defined and claims of ability war-ranted as a means of closing the “Higher Education is not gives us what employers want” claims...|$|R
