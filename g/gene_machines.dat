40|$|Based on {{the idea}} of Dawkins that we are built as <b>gene</b> <b>machines</b> and {{cultures}} as meme machines, the present paper examines some of «Russian memes» that act as units for carrying cultural ideas, symbols or practices and can be trasmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures and rituals.

In this paper we introduce general metrics {{to characterize the}} performance of applications {{and apply it to}} a diverse set of applications running on Blue Gene/Q. The applications range from regular, floating-point bound to irregular event-simulator like types. We argue that the proposed metrics are suitable to characterize the performance for a larger set of computational science applications running on today's massively-parallel systems. They therefore do not only allow to assess usability of the Blue Gene/Q architecture for the considered (types of) applications. They also provide more general information on application requirements and valuable input for evaluating the usability of various architectural features, i. e. information, which is needed for future co-design efforts aiming for exascale performance...|$|E

The symposium emerged following a major UK-wide project funded by the Wellcome Trust (via an Engaging Science Society Award) entitled Meet the <b>Gene</b> <b>Machine.</b> This project was led by the SCU, working with eight Science & Discovery Centres around the UK to stimulate discussion and debate with over 10, 000 young adults on issues around genetic testing.

40|$|Elementary school {{students}} are fascinated by science. They are particularly excited about topics that are immediately rel-evant to them—topics around {{the human body and}} what it is made of, basic bodily functions, how and why they look the way they do, and why they get sick and how they get better. As such, science is a powerful tool for getting students ex-cited about reading and for challenging them to apply their developing reading skills to deepen their understanding of topics that are of interest. Author and cancer researcher Fran Balkwill and artist Mic Rolph have teamed up to bring these topics to children in their beautifully illustrated series Enjoy Your Cells.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to design and validate a next-generation sequencing assay (NGS) to detect BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 mutations. We developed an assay using random shearing of genomic DNA followed by RNA bait tile hybridization and NGS sequencing on both the Illumina MiSeq and Ion Personal <b>Gene</b> <b>Machine</b> (PGM). We determined that the MiSeq Reporter software supplied with the instrument could not detect deletions greater than 9 base pairs.

In validation studies, we used DNA from 27 stem cell lines, all with known deleterious BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 mutations, and DNA from 67 consented control indi-viduals who had a total of 352 benign variants.

40|$|Studies in my lab {{have focused}} on DNA transpo-sition in the {{bacterial}} virus, Mu. In vitro {{studies have shown that}} Mu DNA transposition is a three-step process involving DNA breakage, strand transfer and DNA replication. In the first step a nick is introduced {{at each end of the}} transposon. The liberated 3 '-OH groups subse-quently attack a target DNA molecule resulting in strand transfer. The transposon DNA, now covalently linked to the target, is finally repli-cated to generate the transposition end-product, referred to as a cointegrate. The DNA cleavage and strand transfer reactions are mediated by a “jumping <b>gene</b> <b>machine</b> ” or transpososomes, which we discovered in 1987. They are assem-bled by bringing together three different DNA regions via a process involving multiple protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions. The action of four different proteins is required in addition to protein-induced DNA bending or wrapping to overcome the intrinsic stiffness of DNA, which would ordinarily prohibit the assembly of such a structure. Transpososome assembly is a gradual process involving multiple steps with an inherent flexibility whereby alternate pathways can be used in the assembly process, biasing the reaction towards completion under different conditions...|$|R
