40|$|The {{ability to}} provide {{position}} information of wireless emitters comprises a very important communication tool and has extremely valuable applications to military as well as civilian life. GSM {{is the most popular}} method of modulation adopted around the world, for mobile telephony. This thesis is focused on the Time Difference Of Arrival (TDOA) estimation, applied to GSM signals, in noisy channels. Improvements in denoising, in conjunction with wavelet processing, are proposed for estimating the TDOA of signals received at two spatially separated sensors. Wavelet denoising based on a modified maximum likelihood method and a higher order moment method is proposed, to improve the performance. A numerical evaluation of the methods, when unequal SNR conditions prevail, is presented. The performance of the proposed denoising methods in a jamming environment is also addressed. Simple excision schemes to improve the performance when jamming is present, are evaluated. Simulation results indicate good performance of the methods and improved estimates relative to the ones obtained using no denoising. <b>Jamming</b> <b>presence</b> degrades the performance but stil...|$|E

30|$|Our {{proposed}} {{model of}} RF <b>jamming</b> detects the <b>presence</b> of the jammers {{and also to}} classify them. The model is based on multi-modal approach that incorporates PDR and signal strength as the detection parameters. The PDR is computed over the given sample window of time. Signal strength variation (ΔS) and PW are the model-specific parameters. Signal strength variation (ΔS) is the change in signal strength taken in dB, i.e., (ΔS) = S Sobserved - S Snetwork, where S Snetwork is the signal strength achieved during training session without jamming and S Sobserved is the signal strength observed when the network is suspected to be under attack. PW is the measure of time for which (ΔS) {{is greater than the}} threshold value, and it is taken in microseconds.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The IEEE 802. 15. 4 {{standard}} {{provides a}} framework for low data rate communications systems, typically sensor networks. It has the advantage to fit different applications requirements by adequately setting its parameters. When enabling its beacon mode, the protocol {{makes it possible to}} guarantee Quality of Service (QoS) by using its Guaranteed Time Slot (GTS) mechanism. In particular, a GTS slot can be granted to single network nodes, thus allowing them to access the medium without colliding each other. However, the GTS mechanism suffers from a security weakness. That is, it makes considerably easier for an adversary to perform a selective jamming attack to the network. In this thesis work a countermeasure to selective GTS attack has been implemented. The countermeasure aims at significantly reducing the effectiveness of selective <b>jamming</b> in <b>presence</b> of GTS. First of all, the IEEE 802. 15. 4 security sublayer has been extended to enable MAC command and beacon frames encryption and authentication. Then, secured MAC command and beacon frames, in conjunction with a different GTS management, have been used to solve the security weakness. Secondly, the countermeasure has been tested by means of the implementation of a simple application and in a realistic attack scenario. Finally, we evaluate performance both in the presence and absence of the countermeasure and show the effectiveness of proposed solution...|$|R

In this paper, {{the effects of}} GNSS jammers on GPS and Galileo receivers are thoroughly analyzed {{and the use of}} an adaptive notch filter is suggested as an effective countermeasure to jamming. Signals generated by a commercial jammer are broadcast in a large anechoic chamber along with the GPS and Galileo signals generated by a hardware simulator. The analysis is conducted in terms of C/N 0 degradation and different jammer power levels are considered. The use of mitigation techniques, such as notch filtering, significantly improves the performance of GNSS receivers even in the presence of strong and fast-varying <b>jamming</b> signals.

Gold then invited Ry Cooder and his son Joachim {{to participate in the}} sessions; Ry would play guitar and Joachim African percussion. The recording sessions took place in March 1996 in Havana's EGREM studios and yielded two albums released in 1997: [...] A toda Cuba le gusta, credited to the Afro-Cuban All Stars, and Buena Vista Social Club. Both albums, especially the latter, included extended descargas featuring Juan de Marcos on tres, Rubén González (who had taken part in Estrellas de Areíto) on piano, Orlando [...] "Cachaíto" [...] López (Cachao's nephew) on bass and Amadito Valdés on timbales. Buena Vista Social Club went on to become an international sensation, winning the 1998 Grammy for Best Tropical Latin Album and spawning a documentary by Wim Wenders which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 1999. The album directly combined classic Cuban trova and filin with intense descarga <b>jamming.</b> The <b>presence</b> of laúd player Barbarito Torres, as well as Joachim Cooder's udu and dumbek, introduced seldom seen instruments into the genre.|$|R

30|$|Jamming {{attack is}} a serious {{security}} threat in wireless sensor networks. Therefore, {{it is important to}} frame a mechanism to protect wireless sensor networks from various jamming attacks. Jammer intrusion detection and jamming detection are two separate issues. In this paper, a novel jammer detection framework to detect the intrusion of jammer and the <b>presence</b> of <b>jamming</b> in a cluster-based wireless sensor network is proposed. The proposed framework is novel in three aspects: whenever the cluster head receives a packet, it first verifies whether the source node is a legitimate, new node, or a jammer node. Second, when the source node is declared as a new one in the first step, then the framework validates whether the new node is legitimate node in the previous cluster or a jammer node by using cluster head code. Third, the framework observes the behavior of the newly joined node and the existing nodes to identify whether the nodes in the cluster is jammed or not. Additionally, it also classifies the types of <b>jamming,</b> if the <b>presence</b> of <b>jamming</b> is detected. Simulation result shows that the proposed framework performs extremely well and achieves jamming detection rate as high as 99.88 %.|$|R

40|$|Dense, {{unmanaged}} 802. 11 deployments tempt saboteurs into launching jamming {{attacks by}} injecting malicious interference. Nowadays, jammers can be portable devices that transmit intermittently at low power {{in order to}} conserve energy. In this paper, we first conduct extensive experiments on an indoor 802. 11 network to assess the ability of two physical layer functions, rate adaptation and power control, in mitigating <b>jamming.</b> In the <b>presence</b> of a jammer we find that: (a) the use of popular rate adaptation algorithms can significantly degrade network performance and, (b) appropriate tuning of the carrier sensing threshold allows a transmitter to send packets even when being jammed and enables a receiver capture the desired signal. Based on our findings, we build ARES, an Anti-jamming REinforcement System, which tunes the parameters of rate adaptation and power control to improve the performance {{in the presence of}} jammers. ARES ensures that operations under benign conditions are unaffected. To demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of ARES, we evaluate it in three wireless testbeds: (a) an 802. 11 n WLAN with MIMO nodes, (b) an 802. 11 a/g mesh network with mobile jammers and (c) an 802. 11 a WLAN with TCP traffic.

40|$|The non-equilibrium {{transition}} from a fluid-like state to a disordered solid-like state, known as the jamming transition, occurs {{in a wide variety}} of physical systems, such as colloidal suspensions and molecular fluids, when the temperature is lowered or the density increased. Shear stress, as temperature, favors the fluid-like state, and must be also considered to define the system 'jamming phase diagram' [1 - 4]. Frictionless athermal systems [1], for instance, can be described by the zero temperature plane of the jamming diagram in the temperature, density, stress space. Here we consider the jamming of athermal frictional systems [8 - 13] such as granular materials, which are important to a number of applications from geophysics to industry. At constant volume and applied shear stress[1, 2], we show that while in absence of friction a system is either fluid-like or <b>jammed,</b> in the <b>presence</b> of friction a new region in the density shear-stress plane appears, where new dynamical regimes are found. In this region a system may slip, or even flow with a steady velocity for a long time in response to an applied stress, but then eventually jams.

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 The {{installation}} of engineered log jams (ELJs) {{is a common}} river restoration practice, implemented to modify flow structure and increase hydraulic complexity {{for the benefit of}} streambank protection and fish habitat. However, few studies have directly assessed the effects of ELJs on flow structure and complexity. This study presents a comprehensive approach to assess the effects of a meander ELJ on flow structure and complexity, defined herein as spatial pattern and spatial variance, respectively. A 2 D hydrodynamic model, iRIC SToRM, was used to simulate flow conditions in a 77 m reach of the Calapooia River, Oregon with and without an ELJ at 1 %, 20 %, and 62 % ELJ submergence. The simulated flow field was analyzed using coherent flow structure identification, maps of turbulence measures, and wavelet analysis along linear transects. Generally, once submerged, the ELJ appeared to primarily rearrange the spatial pattern of flow and not affect turbulence metric magnitudes. For example, at high flow, representing 62 % ELJ submergence, a greater number of coherent flow structures was identified in the ELJ model than in the no ELJ model run, but the magnitudes of turbulence metrics were unaffected. At low flow, representing 1 % <b>jam</b> submergence, the <b>presence</b> of the ELJ did not affect the number of coherent flow structures identified, but was responsible for a localized effect on turbulence metric magnitudes. Furthermore, results indicated that the meander jam decreased the size of the eddies {{in the vicinity of the}} jam at higher flows, with practical implications associated with the reduction of erosive energy of flow and potentially more favorable fish habitat at higher flows when low energy refuge habitat is often limiting for fish. Taken together, results indicate a lack of impact of the ELJ on flow complexity and greater impact on flow structure. In addition, the methods used in this study for characterizing flow structure and complexity may be applied to guide future restoration projects and to assess effectiveness of restoration designs...|$|R
40|$|The {{modified}} algorithm of {{the adaptive}} compensating {{of the active}} noise jamming, based on usage of the recurrence estimation of inverse covariance matrix of jamming {{in the course of}} an self-tuning is considered. The matrix estimation is formed by a method of a serial regression (SRM), a consequence application of a lemma about inversing of a matrix to differential – to the difference equation for a rounded estimation of direct covariance matrix of jamming (CMJ). The single estimation of straight line CMJ is formed as result dyad products of the instant vectors of noises in handling channels. In partial channels the adaptive transversal filters with the self-tuning on value of a signal of an aggregate error are implemented. In article skeleton diagrams of devices of the compensating implemented by various methods are resulted. Mathematical modeling of operation of the algorithms, implemented by a method of the least squares (criterion of a minimum RMS error) and a method of a serial regression is performed. Results of mathematical modeling of operation of the device of compensating of active noises jamming in the conditions of the active radio-electronic counteraction at multipath propagation of signals both non-identical amplitude and phase characteristics of channels of handling are resulted. Optimal values of technical parameters of devices of compensating of the active noises jamming providing obtaining of demanded values of coefficient of suppression are given. The comparative analysis of indexes of efficiency of classical and offered algorithms of compensating is made. Advantage of algorithm of compensating of the active noises jamming, using the recurrence estimation of a inverse covariance matrix of jamming is shown.

40|$|Driftwood {{is widely}} {{recognized}} as a relevant component of riverine systems due to its complex interactions with flow, sediment transport and vegetation dynamics. In-channel large wood has a relevant geomorphic and ecological role as it enhances morphological diversity and creates a variety of physical habitats that sustain high biodiversity. Its presence can also increase flood risk and therefore wood is often removed from streams especially in densely populated areas. Recent river restoration policies aim to maximise the environmental benefits of driftwood and minimise risks. The study of wood dynamics can provide useful information to define guidelines for sustainable wood management. Multi-thread systems represent a particularly interesting and challenging context for the investigation of wood dynamics because of their complex geometry, the presence of vegetated islands and the frequent, intense changes in channel pattern observed even for moderate discharge fluctuations. However, comparatively few studies focus on driftwood in large braided rivers and limited quantitative information is available on wood transport, deposition and remobilisation in these systems. The goals of the present work are: a) characterising the spatial organisation of wood deposits and identifying typical retention sites and styles; b) analysing the influence of flow regime, channel morphology, wood supply and log properties (size and shape) on dispersal patterns; c) investigating wood remobilisation induced by discharge fluctuations and bed reworking; and d) analysing long-term wood storage volume and budget. A combination of field-scale direct observations, remote sensing techniques and physical modelling was used to investigate wood and channel dynamics. Field-scale monitoring carried out on the Tagliamento River (Italy) allowed the observation of complex interactions and feedbacks between channel, vegetation and wood dynamics. Laboratory simulations – carried out in two large flumes at the University of Trento (Italy) and at the University of Hull (UK) – were employed to investigate individual wood dispersal mechanisms under controlled conditions and to explore the role of governing parameters. In large rivers, floods are the primary driver of wood recruitment through the erosion of vegetated banks and islands; field-scale observations showed that these localised wood inputs control wood storage at sub-reach scale because {{a large proportion of}} eroded trees is retained close to the input point in sparse, small jams. Physical modelling highlighted a complex relationships between flow stage and the longitudinal and vertical distribution of wood; high discharge increases the ability of the system to transfer wood, {{but at the same time}} generates complex inundation patterns where a larger number of sites are available for wood retention. No clear link between flow stage and the vertical distribution of wood is observed, probably because water surface elevation exhibits small changes with discharge in flat braided river cross-sections. Driftwood element properties also influence deposition patterns; log diameter controls travel distance as it governs flotation and therefore the likeliness of deposition. High element length and complex piece shape sustain the formation of large <b>jams.</b> The <b>presence</b> of a root bole is also associated to short travel distance and low relative elevation. At reach-scale, the spatial distribution of wood is the product of local inputs during major floods and reorganisation of deposits induced by minor events. Wood pattern exhibits a threshold behaviour with supply. High input rates determine very high spatial density and the formation of large, stable jams. Two processes govern wood reorganisation over different time scales, namely network inundation – inducing rapid changes in flow field – and bed reworking. In the first case, the persistence of deposits depends on the magnitude of discharge fluctuations as wood dispersed by small floods is easily removed by larger events. High relative elevation and large jam size enhance wood stability, while the presence of a root wad has a dual effect as it determines large accumulations at low elevation. Channel pattern reworking determines intense turnover of driftwood deposits regardless of supply rate, piece properties and jam size, save for very large accumulations. As a consequence, wood deposition occurs mostly on empty braidplain areas as opposed to pre-existing sites. These results suggests that wood (alone) has little direct effect on reach-scale bed geometry in a large braided river; however, deposited wood significantly influences local hydraulics and morphology, enhancing physical habitat diversity. Moreover, deposited wood favours the accumulation of fine sediment, nutrients and seeds and often exhibits vegetative regeneration. These processes lead to the transformation of instable driftwood pieces into vegetated islands, which in turn can trap more wood. Therefore, wood has a relevant, indirect effect on braided river morphodynamics through the establishment of vegetation, whose presence influences network complexity and evolution...|$|R
