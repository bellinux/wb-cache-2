You either love it, or you hate it. I love this old country. It’s the best friend I’ve had for fifty years, and it’s never let me down. It’s taken care of me, this old country. So <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> it.”.|$|E

50|$|Sultan Mustafa {{was very}} {{influenced}} by mysticism. Oracles predicted his son Selim {{would be a}} world-conqueror, so he organized a joyous feast lasting seven days. Selim was very well educated in the palace. Sultan Mustafa III bequeathed his son as his successor; however, Selim's uncle Abdulhamid I ascended the throne after Mustafa's death. Sultan Abdulhamid <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> Selim and put great emphasis on his education.|$|R

But {{as to the}} rest, as to the others, if one stays to assist Mrs Harville, I think it need be only one. Mrs Charles Musgrove will, of course, wish {{to get back to}} her children; but if Anne will stay, no one so proper, so capable as Anne." ...|$|E
6000|$|They {{followed}} him down a draughty {{corridor to the}} black-wainscoted gun-room {{at the base of}} the crumbling tower, and when he had lighted a lamp its glow revealed a modern collection of costly guns. There were also trout-rods hung upon the wall, and a few good sporting etchings, at all of which Musker glanced somewhat contemptuously. [...] "These are Mr. Forsyth's, and <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> them, but he only belongs to the place by purchase and marriage. Those belonged to the Thurstons--the old, dead Thurstons--and they hunted men," [...] he said.|$|E
30|$|A: <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> him. Sometimes, {{my daughters}} {{came to visit}} us. I handled it myself and didn’t want to use their time. As they didn’t have time during the day, they usually visited us after work. My {{youngest}} daughter was especially helpful as she lives close to the city hospital. Since it was expensive to have hospital meals, she sent meals to us most of the time.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was born}} {{the son of a}} woodman who chopped down trees in the forest and sold the wood for a living. When I grew up, I too became a woodchopper, and after my father died <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> my old mother as long as she lived.

6000|$|A {{nation in}} such a temper will surely be taken at its word. Where the carcase is, there the eagles will be {{gathered}} together; and {{there will not be}} wanting to such nations--as there were not wanting in old Greece and Rome--despots who will give them all they want, and more, and say to them: [...] "Yes, you shall eat and drink; and yet you shall not die.

6000|$|I wish he {{had told}} me what breed it was, if there are others; but I shall know the dog next time, and then if I can bring myself to it I will put {{delicacy}} aside and ask. If I seem strangely interested in dogs, I have a reason for it; for a dog saved me from an embarrassing position once, and that has made me grateful to these animals; and if by study I could learn to tell some of the kinds from the others, I should be greatly pleased. I only know one kind apart, yet, and that is the kind that saved me that time. I always know that kind when I meet it, and if it is hungry or lost <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> it.

But I can't go now, for there's a sight of things to do, and mother is always laid up with {{rheumatism}} in cold weather. So much butter-making down cellar is bad for her; but she won't let me do that in summer, so <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> her in winter. I can see to things night and morning, and through the day she's quiet, and sits piecing carpet-rags and resting up for next spring. We made and wove all the carpets in the house, except the parlor one. Mrs. Taylor gave us that, and the curtains, and the easy-chair. Mother takes a sight of comfort in that." ...|$|E

5000|$|In Belgium, Hazard's {{talent and}} similar {{ascension}} up the country's football hierarchy {{has led to}} comparisons to former Belgian international Enzo Scifo.

60|$|I {{caught one}} cold on Wednesday last, another on Thursday, two on Friday, four on Saturday, {{and one at}} every station between this and Ingleborough on Monday. I never was in such ignoble misery of cold. I've no cough to speak of, nor {{anything}} worse than usual {{in the way of}} sneezing, but my hands are cold, my pulse nowhere, my nose tickles and wrings me, my ears sing--like kettles, my mouth has no taste, my heart no hope of ever being good for anything, any more. I never passed such a wretched morning by my own fireside in all my days, and I've quite a fiendish pleasure in telling you all this, and thinking how miserable you'll be too. Oh me, if I ever get to feel like myself again, won't <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> myself.|$|E
6000|$|He {{had always}} called Sir Hugo Mallinger his uncle, {{and when it}} once {{occurred}} to him to ask about his father and mother, the baronet had answered, [...] "You lost your father and mother when you were quite a little one; that is why <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> you." [...] Daniel then straining to discern something in that early twilight, had a dim sense of having been kissed very much, and surrounded by thin, cloudy, scented drapery, till his fingers caught in something hard, which hurt him, {{and he began to}} cry. Every other memory he had was of the little world in which he still lived. And at that time he did not mind about learning more, for he was too fond of Sir Hugo to be sorry for the loss of unknown parents. Life was very delightful to the lad, with an uncle who was always indulgent and cheerful--a fine man in the bright noon of life, whom Daniel thought absolutely perfect, and whose place was one of the finest in England, at once historical; romantic, and home-like: a picturesque architectural outgrowth from an abbey, which had still remnants of the old monastic trunk. Diplow lay in another county, and was a comparatively landless place which had come into the family from a rich lawyer on the female side who wore the perruque of the restoration; whereas the Mallingers had the grant of Monk's Topping under Henry the Eighth, and ages before had held the neighboring lands of King's Topping, tracing indeed their origin to a certain Hugues le Malingre, who came in with the Conqueror--and also apparently with a sickly complexion which had been happily corrected in his descendants. Two rows of these descendants, direct and collateral, females of the male line, and males of the female, looked down in the gallery over the cloisters on the nephew Daniel as he walked there: men in armor with pointed beards and arched eyebrows, pinched ladies in hoops and ruffs with no face to speak of; grave-looking men in black velvet and stuffed hips, and fair, frightened women holding little boys by the hand; smiling politicians in magnificent perruques, and ladies of the prize-animal kind, with rosebud mouths and full eyelids, according to Lely; then a generation whose faces were revised and embellished in the taste of Kneller; and so on through refined editions of the family types in the time of Reynolds and Romney, till the line ended with Sir Hugo and his younger brother Henleigh. This last had married Miss Grandcourt, and taken her name along with her estates, thus making a junction between two equally old families, impaling the three Saracens' heads proper and three bezants of the one with the tower and falcons argent of the other, and, as it happened, uniting their highest advantages in the prospects of that Henleigh Mallinger Grandcourt who is at present more of an acquaintance to us than either Sir Hugo or his nephew Daniel Deronda.|$|E
