50|$|The P100 {{followed}} the structural {{approach of the}} existing Isabella, incorporating an <b>integral</b> <b>chassis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|At the rear, {{the engine}} sits on {{integral}} monocoque rails, and the chassis {{is not an}} extension of the bottom or [...] "tub"; of the cockpit part of the monocoque as on many <b>integral</b> <b>chassis</b> design cars.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{the result}} of close {{co-operation}} between Enterprise Bus Ltd (the chassis manufacturer) and Plaxton. [...] The fully welded stainless steel <b>integral</b> <b>chassis</b> final assembly is supplied in right hand drive format as a running unit to Plaxton. Final body assembly is undertaken by Plaxton in Scarborough, England.|$|E

50|$|The last Pulsar Gemini {{bodywork}} {{was constructed}} in 2006. In 2008, Wright launched the Gemini 2 <b>integral</b> with <b>chassis</b> modules supplied by VDL Bus.|$|R
50|$|Denning {{commenced}} bodying buses in Brisbane in 1958. Denning's first <b>integral</b> bus (both <b>chassis</b> and body), the Monocoach, {{was launched}} in 1966. Along with the later Denair and Landseer it would become the dominant long distance coach in Australia.|$|R
5000|$|The SJ Cherokees were {{assembled}} in Brisbane, Australia from 1981. The initial units were fully built imports {{that needed to}} be partly disassembled for right-hand-drive. Later Jeep Australia began full assembly of the SUV and J20 trucks from knock-down kits. Problems with spare parts, quality control, the limited capacity of the assembly plant (maximum of 60 Cherokee/J20 vehicles per month), and lack of dealer support (many were multi-franchise stores so Jeeps were not their focus) were disadvantages to maintaining market share. Australian tariff regulations defined [...] "real" [...] 4x4 vehicles as having a separate frame and chassis construction and had a 25% duty and no quota restrictions, while vehicles with an <b>integral</b> <b>chassis</b> were classified as [...] "cars" [...] and subject to both an import quantity restriction and a 57.5% tax. This meant the continuing assembly of the SJ models even after the compact XJ model was introduced by AMC. All Cherokee assembly was discontinued in Australia by 1985, three years after the SJ had been replaced in the U.S. by the XJ.|$|E
50|$|The Lamborghini Athon {{is capable}} of being driven due to Bertone Studios making it a fully {{functional}} ss-production concept car. Under {{the hood of the}} Lamborghini Athon sits a V8 Duel Over the Head Cam engine with two valves per cylinder capable of a max power of 260 brake horsepower at 7500 RPM and a torque of 237 feet per lbs with a compression ratio of ten to one. The transmission contains an all synchromesh gearbox that consists of a five speed with a non-dual single dry plate hydraulically assisted clutch and an axle ration of 14/35. Also note that the front suspension and rear suspension are independent of each other. The Bertone company SpA design includes an <b>integral</b> <b>chassis</b> and steel body. The suspension has independent wry coil springs and a telescopic shock absorbers. The Campagnolo cast magnesium pneumatically actuated brakes consist of a Girling ventilated discs. The fronts tires measure out to be 195/50 VR 15 Michelin and the rear tires are 275/40 VR 15 Michelin. The Lamborghini Athon weighs in at 2390 lbs and has an 80 Liter fuel tank capable of holding 21 gallons of fuel. It measures out to be 147.2 inches in length, 74.1 inches in width, and 41 inches in height. In terms of performance, the Lamborghini Athon is able to reach a top speed of 170 miles per hour and can go from 0-60 in 7.3 seconds. The RM Soldeby's company auctioned the Lamborghini Athon in Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este on May 21, 2011. The Lamborghini Athon sold for $487,000 United States Dollars and its present-day estimated price value, according to RM Auctions, is between $213,000 to $312,000 United States Dollar.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{factsheet}} is to provide the energy-conscious manufactured home owner or potential buyer with information on: {{what to look for}} when buying a mobile home. how to select an energy-efficient manufactured home site. how to select a manufactured home park conducive to an energy-efficient lifestyle. {{what can be done to}} improve the energy efficiency of an existing manufactured home. The term "manufactured home " is used somewhat synonymously with a mobile home or house trailer. A mobile home is a dwelling built in a factory on an <b>integral</b> <b>chassis</b> that can be transported in one or more sections. Each section is between 8 and 14 feet wide, and can be up to 76 feet long (Tables 1 and 2). In 1986, one-quarter of all new, single family homes sold in America were manufactured homes. Many manufactured homes are used as permanent residences; most are never moved. Their wheels, installed at the factory, are used as a means of transportation to the home site, at which point they are usually removed. Manufactured homes are built to federal standards and inspected by federally certified agencies. Modular homes are built to state and local codes...|$|E
5000|$|The {{advent of}} unibody construction, where the car body is unified with, and {{structurally}} <b>integral</b> to the <b>chassis,</b> made custom coachbuilding (in {{the traditional sense}} of putting a bespoke body on a factory supplied separate chassis) practically impossible. Many coachbuilders closed down, were bought by manufacturers or changed their core business to other activities: ...|$|R
50|$|In 2008 Bustech {{became part}} of the Transit Australia Group as part of a {{restructuring}} of the Calabro operations. In the same year the company launched its first <b>integral</b> bus (both <b>chassis</b> and body), the 10.5 metre MDi. This was followed by the 12.5 metre XDi and in July 2011 by the 12.5 metre CDi double decker, the first double deck citybus built for Australian operation since 1973.|$|R
50|$|The Morris Six Series MS is a six-cylinder midsize {{car from}} Morris Motors Limited which was {{produced}} from 1948 to 1953. Announced with Morris Motors' Minor, Oxford and Wolseley ranges on Tuesday 26 October 1948 it was Morris's first post war six-cylinder car. All the new cars were of <b>integral</b> construction of <b>chassis</b> and body and rode on {{independent front suspension}} with torsion bars. At launch the car was priced at £607 (including tax) on the UK market though the price went to £671 on 1 March 1949.|$|R
25|$|After the re-organisation of British Leyland, both VR and Fleetline became Leyland offerings and, when {{production}} of both ceased in 1981, over 6,400 VRs and 11,500 Fleetlines had been built. Frustrated {{at the lack}} of competition to Leyland, some operators turned to other manufacturers, who began to offer alternatives to the state-owned manufacturer. Supply problems at Leyland did not help matters and products such as the Scania Metropolitan and Dennis Dominator began to make small inroads into the rear-engined market, while the Volvo Ailsa B55 reintroduced a front-engined double-deck chassis, with a front entrance, with some success. The Scania/Metro Cammell Weymann partnership, which produced the Metropolitan, ended in the late 1970s and forced MCW to introduce its own rear-engined product, available as an <b>integral</b> or <b>chassis,</b> the MCW Metrobus. The success of the Metrobus, particularly with West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive and London Transport, would spur Leyland on to develop a new heavy-duty rear-engined bus, sealing the eventual withdrawal of the Atlantean from the market.|$|R
5000|$|The {{project was}} a {{follow-up}} to Earl's famous 1938 Y-job. Like all his projects, it was built to be roadworthy, and became Earl's personal automobile for two years after finishing its tour of the auto show circuit. With a body made of aluminium, magnesium, and fiberglass, it was powered by a supercharged 215 cuin L V8 able to run on gasoline (petrol) or methanol (like Indy roadsters of the period did), and had an unusually-placed rear-mounted Buick Dynaflow automatic transmission. This was later changed to a GM Hydramatic. In addition to its jet inspired design, the 1951 Le Sabre also featured numerous advanced features, including a 12-volt electrical system (most cars of the period were 6-volt), heated seats, electric headlights concealed behind the center oval [...] "jet intake", front bumper dagmars (later made famous on 1957-9 Cadillacs), a water sensor to activate the power top, and electric lifting jacks <b>integral</b> to the <b>chassis</b> to aid tire changes. (This idea would be copied decades later by Formula One race teams.) ...|$|R
