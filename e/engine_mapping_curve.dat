40|$|Nowadays, {{automotive}} {{manufacturers are}} submitted to strong constraints in engine calibration such as: low fuel consumption, emission-control legislation and driver requests for driving comfort and perfor-mances. These constraints {{lead to an}} increasing complexity of the engines and thus {{an increasing number of}} parameters to be tuned, making the empirical engine calibration by a scan of parameter values im-possible at engine test-bench. New methodologies in automated engine calibration based on statistics and optimization have emerged in order {{to limit the number of}} experimental tests to be run. The optimization problem of engine calibration consists in the determination of engine tuning param-eters that minimize the cumulated fuel consumption and pollutant emissions on a driving cycle generally associated with legislation norms. This cycle is decomposed in a set of stationary operating points of the engine characterized by its speed and its torque (the transient behaviors of the engine are not taken into account in the stabilized calibration). Then, the optimal tuning parameters of the engine should be de¯ned for each operating points, the functions de¯ning these parameters on the whole engine operating domain are called the <b>engine</b> <b>maps.</b> These two-dimensional optimal <b>engine</b> <b>maps</b> are then integrated in the engine control unit in the vehicle.

Banned with this are double exhaust-blown diffusers, which use exhaust gases re-routed over the diffuser to increase downforce, although single blown diffusers are still allowed. Controversy emerged over the use of [...] "off-throttle blown diffusers" [...] early in the season, with the FIA first banning the concept and then repealing the ban pending discussion with the teams. The off-throttle blown diffuser increases downforce by keeping the engine spinning while the car is under braking, channeling hot exhaust gasses over the diffuser and allowing for higher cornering speeds. The FIA announced that the ban would be reintroduced from the , limiting the amount of throttle that can be applied during braking. Tighter restrictions will be introduced for the 2012 season.

Among the most important vari-ables to be controlled are the temperatures of coolant and oil that circulate through the engine block. Because of the large time con-stants associated with thermodynamic systems, controlling these variables often represents a bottleneck in the <b>engine</b> <b>mapping</b> and calibration processes. In this paper, we examine a particular layout for a thermal management unit, which is currently being used in practice. By developing and analyzing a thermodynamic model of the system, we are able to gain insight into the system dynamics and explore special features to optimize the temperature response. In particular, we will show how the overactuation in the system may be leveraged in the presence of hard saturation constraints and different dynamic actuator authorities.

40|$|AbstractAir {{pollution}} problems persist {{in many cities}} throughout the world, despite drastic reductions in regulated emissions of criteria pollutants from vehicles when tested on standardised driving cycles. New vehicle emissions regulations in the European Union and United States {{require the use of}} OBD and portable emissions measurement systems (PEMS) to confirm vehicles meet specified limits during on-road operation. The resultant in-use testing will yield a large amount of OBD and PEMS data across a range of vehicles. If used properly, the availability of OBD and PEMS data could enable greater insight into the nature of real-world emissions and allow detailed modelling of vehicle energy use and emissions. This paper presents a methodology to use this data to create <b>engine</b> <b>maps</b> of fuel use and emissions of nitrous oxides (NOx), carbon dioxide (CO 2) and carbon monoxide (CO). Effective gear ratios, gearbox shift envelopes, candidate <b>engine</b> <b>maps</b> and a set of vehicle configurations are simulated over driving cycles using the ADVISOR powertrain simulation tool. This method is demonstrated on three vehicles – one truck and two passenger cars – tested on a vehicle dynamometer and one driven with a PEMS. The optimum vehicle configuration and associated maps were able to reproduce the shape and magnitude of observed fuel use and emissions on a per second basis. In general, total simulated fuel use and emissions were within 5 % of observed values across the three test cases. The fitness of this method for other purposes was demonstrated by creating cold start maps and isolating the performance of tailpipe emissions reduction technologies. The potential of this work extends beyond the creation of vehicle <b>engine</b> <b>maps</b> to allow investigations into: emissions hot spots; real-world emissions factors; and accurate air quality modelling using simulated per second emissions from vehicles operating in over any driving cycle...|$|R

Models to predict the emissions from heavy trucks in real world on road conditions are therefore of great interest. Most such models are based on data achieved from stationary measurements, i. e. <b>engine</b> <b>maps.</b> This type of “quasi stationary ” models could also be of interest in other applications where emission models of low complexity are desired, such as engine control and simulation and control of exhaust aftertreatment systems. In this paper, results from quasi stationary calculations of fuel consumption, CO, HC, NOx and PM emissions are compared with time resolved measurements of the corresponding quantities. Measurement data from three Euro 3 -class engines is used. The differences are {{discussed in terms of}} the conditions during transients and correction models for quasi stationary calculations are presented. Simply using <b>engine</b> <b>maps</b> without transient correction is not sufficient. For the engines studied, accumulated errors of up to 60 - 70 % are common before correction. Earlier work in this field has mainly been focused on statistical correction models of accumulated emissions. The transient correction model presented in this paper uses stepwise correction and has a physical interpretation. The delay introduced by the turbocharger during transients results in lower air flows and hence lower air-fuel ratios, than predicted from <b>engine</b> <b>maps.</b> A delay time and a corresponding transient air-fuel equivalence ratio (λ) is estimated in each time step and is used for compensation of the emissions. Another important aspect of models for simulating real world emissions is generality, whether a common emission model can be used for all engines of a given emission classification.
