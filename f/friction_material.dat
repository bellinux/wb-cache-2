25|$|Cold judder, on {{the other}} hand, {{is the result of}} uneven disc wear {{patterns}} or disc thickness variation (DTV). These variations in the disc surface are usually the result of extensive vehicle road usage. DTV is usually attributed to the following causes: waviness and roughness of disc surface, misalignment of axis (runout), elastic deflection, wear and <b>friction</b> <b>material</b> transfers.|$|E
25|$|The rotor {{is usually}} made of cast iron, but may {{in some cases}} be made of {{composites}} such as reinforced carbonâ€“carbon or ceramic matrix composites. This {{is connected to the}} wheel and/or the axle. To retard the wheel, <b>friction</b> <b>material</b> in the form of brake pads, mounted on the brake caliper, is forced mechanically, hydraulically, pneumatically, or electromagnetically against both sides of the rotor. Friction causes the rotor and attached wheel to slow or stop.|$|E
25|$|Scarring (US: Scoring) {{can occur}} if brake pads are not changed {{promptly}} {{when they reach}} the end of their service life and are considered worn out. Once enough of the <b>friction</b> <b>material</b> has worn away, the pad's steel backing plate (for glued pads) or the pad retainer rivets (for riveted pads) will bear directly upon the disc's wear surface, reducing braking power and making scratches on the disc. Generally a moderately scarred / scored disc, which operated satisfactorily with existing brake pads, will be equally usable with new pads. If the scarring is deeper but not excessive, it can be repaired by machining off a layer of the disc's surface. This can only be done a limited number of times as the disc has a minimum rated safe thickness. The minimum thickness value is typically cast into the disc during manufacturing on the hub or the edge of the disc. In Pennsylvania, which {{has one of the most}} rigorous auto safety inspection programs in North America, an automotive disc cannot pass safety inspection if any scoring is deeper than , and must be replaced if machining will reduce the disc below its minimum safe thickness.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to generate the knowledge for formulating low-Cu and Cu-free brake <b>friction</b> <b>materials</b> without using and releasing hazardous materials that are listed on Washington State and California State Senate Bills. Model brake material samples were manufactured and tested in the Friction Assessment and Screening Test (FAST) and the full scale automotive brake dynamometer (Dyno) using a SAE J 2430 test procedure. The SAE recommended a J 2430 test procedure which provided the necessary data for the Brake Effectiveness Evaluation Procedure (BEEP) by the Brake Manufacturers 2 Ì† 7 Council. The newly developed low-Cu and Cu-free brake <b>friction</b> <b>materials</b> were formulated by modifying a typical Non Asbestos Organic (NAO) (T-Baseline) formulation and a typical Semi-Metallic (M-Baseline) formulation. The NAO Cu-free brake <b>friction</b> <b>materials</b> contain geopolymer and natural hemp fibers as a partial replacement of phenolic resin and synthetic Kevlar fibers, respectively. Friction performance and wear data from a series of FAST tests were used to train an artificial neural network, which was used to optimize the NAO Cu-free formulations. Then, the optimized low-Cu and Cu-free brake <b>friction</b> <b>materials</b> were tested on the Dyno. Dyno test results showed that all NAO Cu-free brake <b>friction</b> <b>materials</b> have passed the Brake Effectiveness Evaluation Procedure (BEEP), did not exhibit thermal fade when temperature was increased and were slightly sensitive to speed. The NAO Cu-free brake <b>friction</b> <b>materials</b> exhibits slightly lower average friction level when compared to the baseline materials (T-Baseline). The Cu-free brake <b>friction</b> <b>materials,</b> as well as the rotors, exhibit higher wear than the detected wear on the T-Baseline material. The semi-metallic low-Cu and Cu-free brake <b>friction</b> <b>materials</b> have also passed the BEEP. Dyno test results indicated that the semi-metallic low-Cu and Cu-free <b>friction</b> <b>materials</b> did not exhibit thermal fade and were slightly sensitive to speed. The semi-metallic low-Cu and Cu-free <b>materials</b> exhibited lower <b>friction</b> level and higher wear on the pads when compared to the M-Baseline material. The semi-metallic Cu-free material outperformed the M-Baseline material in term of rotor wear. Analyses using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) microanalysis on the tested materials show that the friction surface of the T-baseline material was covered with fully developed and stable friction layer (third body) consisting mostly of Fe-oxides, different forms of carbon and compounds of materials originally present in the bulk material. The NAO Cu-free materials (T 30 - 15 and T 30 - 16) did not develop a sufficient friction layer. The friction layer seemed to be responsible for the detected lower wear in the T-Baseline compared to the NAO Cu-free materials (T 30 - 15 and T 30 - 16), and it acted as a solid lubricant on the interface between the rubbing pad and the cast iron rotor lowering the adhesive forces. The friction and wear of the T-Baseline material was controlled by adhesive mechanisms. The NAO Cu-free materials (T 30 - 15 and T 30 - 16) with content of geopolymer replacing phenolic resin matrix exhibited extensive abrasive wear in addition to adhesive mechanisms. The capacity to form a friction layer on the surface plays a considerable role when lowering the wear of NAO brake <b>friction</b> <b>materials.</b> The <b>friction</b> layer was formed by compaction and interaction of brake wear particles, and its stability and character depend on the chemistry of the bulk materials in contact as well as the temperature, pressure and sliding speed during a friction process. SEM and EDX analyses also showed that the semi-metallic pads have developed friction layer on the friction surfaces. The difference was that the M-Baseline material had well developed friction layer, but the Low-Cu (M 4) and Cu-free (M 5) materials, had many smaller patches of friction layer disturbed on the surfaces...|$|R
5000|$|Various brake designs such as band {{brakes and}} many drum brakes are self-assisting: when the brake is applied, {{some of the}} braking force feeds back into the brake {{mechanism}} to further self-apply the brake.

Self-assist reduces the input force needed to apply the brake, but exaggerates fade, since a reduction in pad <b>friction</b> <b>material</b> height or thickness also reduces pad force.
