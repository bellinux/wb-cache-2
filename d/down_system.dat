25|$|Boric acid {{is used in}} some {{nuclear power}} plants as a neutron poison. The boron in boric acid reduces the {{probability}} of thermal fission by absorbing some thermal neutrons. Fission chain reactions are generally driven by the probability that free neutrons will result in fission and {{is determined by the}} material and geometric properties of the reactor. Natural boron consists of approximately 20% boron-10 and 80% boron-11 isotopes. Boron-10 has a high cross-section for absorption of low energy (thermal) neutrons. By increasing boric acid concentration in the reactor coolant, the probability that a neutron will cause fission is reduced. Changes in boric acid concentration can effectively regulate the rate of fission taking place in the reactor. Boric acid is used only in pressurized water reactors (PWRs) whereas boiling water reactors (BWRs) employ control rod pattern and coolant flow for power control. BWRs use an aqueous solution of boric acid and borax or Sodium Pentaborate for an emergency shut <b>down</b> <b>system.</b> Boric acid may be dissolved in spent fuel pools used to store spent fuel elements. The concentration is high enough to keep neutron multiplication at a minimum. Boric acid was dumped over Reactor 4 of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant after its meltdown to prevent another reaction from occurring.|$|E

40|$|Important {{factors in}} a top <b>down</b> <b>systems</b> biology study. In top <b>down</b> <b>systems</b> biology, {{the answer to}} a certain {{biological}} question is sought in the systems wide response of a biological system to the chosen experimental conditions. The response of the biological system is measured with -omics tools, such as, transcriptomics or metabolomics, and advanced data analysis tools are applied to extract biologically relevant information from the measurements. The success of a top <b>down</b> <b>systems</b> biology approach is highly dependent on the information richness of the data obtained from the -omics measurements. Therefore, it is essential for a successful top <b>down</b> <b>systems</b> biology study to balance the three key factors: (i) biological question, (ii) experimental design, and (iii) data analysis. In Chapter 1, we discuss these three key factors, their interdependence, and their significance for successful top <b>down</b> <b>systems</b> biology. In Chapters 2 to 6, different aspects of the relation between a biological question and a data analysis strategy, such as, data pretreatment and selection of the most suited data analysis method, are further explored...|$|R

5000|$|The non-anamorphic {{widescreen}} ratios (most commonly 1.85:1) used {{in modern}} feature films makes inefficient {{use of the}} available image area on 35 mm film using the standard 4-perf pulldown; {{the height of a}} 1.85:1 frame occupying only 65% of the distance between the frames. It is clear, therefore, that a change to a 3-perf pulldown would allow for a 25% reduction in film consumption whilst still accommodating the full 1.85:1 frame. Ever since the introduction of these widescreen formats in the 1950s various film directors and cinematographers have argued in favour of the industry making such a change.
