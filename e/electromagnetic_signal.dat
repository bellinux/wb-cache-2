25|$|One of {{the most}} {{effective}} ways to prevent electromagnetic attacks is to make it difficult for an attacker to collect an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>signal</b> at the physical level. Broadly, the hardware designer could design the encryption hardware to reduce signal strength or to protect the chip. Circuit and wire shielding, such as a Faraday cage, are effective in reducing the signal, as well as filtering the signal or introducing extraneous noise to mask the signal. Additionally, most electromagnetic attacks require attacking equipment to be very close to the target, so distance is an effective countermeasure. Circuit designers can also use certain glues or design components {{in order to make it}} difficult or impossible to depackage the chip without destroying it.|$|E
25|$|Because neutrinos {{interact}} {{so little}} with matter, {{it is thought}} that a supernova's neutrino emissions carry information about the innermost regions of the explosion. Much of the visible light comes from the decay of radioactive elements produced by the supernova shock wave, and even light from the explosion itself is scattered by dense and turbulent gases, and thus delayed. The neutrino burst is expected to reach Earth before any electromagnetic waves, including visible light, gamma rays or radio waves. The exact time delay depends on the velocity of the shock wave and on the thickness of the outer layer of the star. For a Type II supernova, astronomers expect the neutrino flood to be released seconds after the stellar core collapse, while the first <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>signal</b> may emerge hours later, after the explosion shock wave has had time to reach the surface of the star. The Supernova Early Warning System project uses a network of neutrino detectors to monitor the sky for candidate supernova events; the neutrino signal will provide a useful advance warning of a star exploding in the Milky Way.|$|E
500|$|The {{first use}} of the site for {{astrophysics}} was in 1945, when Bernard Lovell wished to use some equipment left over from World War II, including a gun laying radar, to investigate cosmic rays. The equipment he was using was a GL II radar system working at a wavelength of 4.2m, provided by J. S. Hey. He originally intended to use the equipment in Manchester; however, electrical interference from the trams that then ran down Oxford Road prevented him from doing so. Consequently, he moved the equipment to Jodrell Bank, [...] south of the city, on 10 December 1945. Lovell's main topic {{of research at the}} time were transient radio echoes, which he confirmed were from ionized meteor trails by October 1946. The first staff were Alf Dean and Frank Foden and meteors were observed by the naked eye while Lovell observed the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>signal</b> on the equipment. Coincidentally, the first time he turned the radar on at Jodrell Bank – 14 December 1945 – the Geminids meteor shower was at a maximum.|$|E

40|$|What is {{the maximum}} {{rate at which}} digital {{information}} can be communicated without error using <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>signals,</b> such as radio communication? According to Shannon theory this rate is {{the capacity of the}} communication channel, which is obtained by maximizing the mutual information between the channel's input and output. Shannon theory, however, has been developed within classical physics, whereas <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>signals</b> are, ultimately, quantum-mechanical entities. To account for this fact, the capacity must be expressed in terms of a complicated optimization of the Holevo information, but explicit solutions are still unknown for arguably the most elementary electromagnetic channel, the one degraded by additive thermal noise. We place bounds on the thermal channel's Holevo information that determine the capacity up to corrections that are insignificant for practical scenarios such as those with high noise or low transmissivity.
