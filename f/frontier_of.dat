5|$|The Scotch-Irish began immigrating to the Middle Colonies {{in waves}} after 1717. They {{primarily}} pushed {{farther into the}} western <b>frontier</b> <b>of</b> the colonies, where they repeatedly confronted the Indians. Other groups included the French Huguenots, Welsh, Dutch, Swedes, Swiss, and Scots Highlanders.|$|E
5|$|Back in Zone Three, Al•Ith {{finds that}} her people have {{forgotten}} her, and her sister, Murti• {{has taken over}} as queen. Disturbed by the changes she sees in Al•Ith, Murti• exiles her to the <b>frontier</b> <b>of</b> Zone Two. Al•Ith, drawn by its allure, tries to enter Zone Two, but finds an unworldly and inhospitable place and is told by invisible people {{that it is not}} her time yet. At the <b>frontier</b> <b>of</b> Zone Five, Ben Ata reluctantly marries Vahshi, a tribal leader of a band of nomads who terrorise the inhabitants of her zone. But Ben Ata's marriage to Al•Ith has changed him, and he disbands most of his armies in Zone Four, sending the soldiers home to rebuild their towns and villages and uplift their communities. He also slowly wins over Vahshi's confidence and persuades her to stop plundering Zone Five.|$|E
5|$|Wiśniowiecki also {{fought against}} the Tatars in 1640–46, whose raids on the {{south-east}} <b>frontier</b> <b>of</b> the Commonwealth endangered his holdings. In 1644 together with Hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski he {{took part in the}} victorious Battle of Ochmatów, in which they crushed forces of Crimean Tatars led by Toğay bey (Tuhaj Bej).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Frontiers</b> <b>of</b> Engineering program assembles a {{group of}} {{emerging}} engineering leaders - usually aged 30-45 - to discuss cutting-edge research in various engineering fields and industry sectors. The goal of the meetings is to bring participants together to collaborate, network, and share ideas. There are three <b>Frontiers</b> <b>of</b> Engineering meetings every year: the U.S. <b>Frontiers</b> <b>of</b> Engineering Symposium, the German-American <b>Frontiers</b> <b>of</b> Engineering Symposium, and the Japan-America <b>Frontiers</b> <b>of</b> Engineering Symposium. The Indo-U.S. <b>Frontiers</b> <b>of</b> Engineering Symposium is held every other year.|$|R

5|$|At {{its maximum}} extent, Tang {{expansion}} brought China into {{direct contact with}} the rising Umayyad Caliphate. China's western borders reached the eastern <b>frontier</b> <b>of</b> the Caliphate. Following the Arab defeat of Sassanid Persia in 651, the Caliphate began its expansion into Central Asia, competing with the Tang's sphere of influence in the region. Chinese and Islamic troops finally clashed at the Battle of Talas in 751. The Chinese lost against the Arabs, now under Abbasid rule, and the Arab army captured Chinese papermaking craftsmen. An Arabic record of the conflict claims that the battle led to the introduction of papermaking to the Islamic world.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the First World War, the Egyptian police controlling the Sinai Peninsula had withdrawn, leaving the area largely unprotected. In February 1915, a German and Ottoman force unsuccessfully attacked the Suez Canal. Minor Ottoman and Bedouin forces operating across the Sinai continued to threaten the canal from March through the Gallipoli Campaign until June, when they practically ceased until the autumn. Meanwhile, the German and Ottoman Empires supported an uprising by the Senussi (a political-religious group) on the western <b>frontier</b> <b>of</b> Egypt which began in November 1915.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 16th century, eastern Honduras {{was still}} beyond the <b>frontier</b> <b>of</b> conquest. The region was known as Taguzgalpa, {{stretching}} from Trujillo in the north, to the valleys of Olancho, Jamastran and Agalta in the west, to the Guayape and Guayambre rivers in the south, and the Caribbean Sea in the east. The territory was well populated by a diverse range of indigenous peoples, including Lencas, Nahuas and Misumalpas. The exact political composition of the territory was unknown to the Spanish, such that the Spanish Crown prohibited campaigns of conquest and reduction in Taguzgalpa owing to ignorance of its makeup.|$|E

5|$|During {{this period}} too, a {{marriage}} was arranged between {{the son of}} Matad, Mormaer of Atholl, and the daughter of Haakon Paulsson, Earl of Orkney. The marriage temporarily secured the northern <b>frontier</b> <b>of</b> the Kingdom, and held out the prospect that a son of one of David's Mormaers could gain Orkney and Caithness for the Kingdom of Scotland. Thus, by the time Henry I died on 1 December 1135, David had more of Scotland under his control than ever before.|$|E
5|$|From time to {{time the}} Spanish {{launched}} punitive military expeditions against the Lakandons to try to stabilise the northern <b>frontier</b> <b>of</b> the Guatemalan colony; the largest expeditions took place in 1685 and 1695. Repeated expeditions into the Lacandon Forest succeeded in destroying some villages but did not manage to subdue {{the inhabitants of the}} region, nor bring it within the Spanish Empire. This successful resistance against Spanish attempts at domination served to attract ever more Indians fleeing colonial rule.|$|E
5|$|Having {{left the}} RAF as a flight {{lieutenant}} on 21 August 1919, Slessor applied to rejoin and {{was offered a}} short-service commission at the same rank on 24 February 1920. In May 1921, he became a flight commander with No. 20 Squadron, which operated Bristol Fighters on the North-West <b>Frontier</b> <b>of</b> India. He joined {{the staff at the}} Directorate of Training and Staff Duties in the Air Ministry in February 1923. The same year, he married Hermione Grace Guinness; they had a son and a daughter. He attended the RAF Staff College, Andover, in 1924, and was promoted squadron leader on 1 January 1925.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the end of}} the Civil War, he {{was sent}} with his {{regiment}} to enforce Reconstruction and fight Indians on the <b>frontiers</b> <b>of</b> Texas, and later he served on the <b>frontiers</b> <b>of</b> Kansas. He retired from the U. S. Army in 1873 as a Brevet Lt. Colonel.|$|R

5|$|He {{set up a}} {{defensive}} alliance against the Mongols, which included Daniil Romanovich, Prince of Halych, Boleslaw the Chaste, Duke of Cracow and other Ruthenian and Polish princes. His allies supported him in occupying the Duchy of Styria in 1254, but it was lost to King Ottokar II of Bohemia six years later. During Béla's reign, a wide buffer zonewhich included Bosnia, Barancs (Braničevo, Serbia) and other newly conquered regionswas established along the southern <b>frontier</b> <b>of</b> Hungary in the 1250s.|$|E
5|$|In Canada, as {{elsewhere}} in the world of European colonies, the <b>frontier</b> <b>of</b> European exploration and settlement tended to be a linguistically diverse and fluid place, as cultures using different languages met and interacted. The need for a common means of communication between the indigenous inhabitants and new arrivals for the purposes of trade, and (in some cases) intermarriage, {{led to the development of}} Mixed languages. Languages like Michif, Chinook Jargon and Bungi creole tended to be highly localized and were often spoken by only a small number of individuals who were frequently capable of speaking another language. Plains Sign Talk, which functioned originally as a trade language used to communicate internationally and across linguistic borders, reached across Canada, the United States and into Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Surtshellir, a {{group of}} {{volcanic}} tunnels in western Iceland recorded in the Landnámabók manuscript, is named after Surtr. In modern Iceland, the notion of Surtr as a giant of fire lives on; Surtsey ("Surtr's island"), a volcanic island that appeared in 1963 in Vestmannaeyjar, Iceland, is named after Surtr. The description found in Gylfaginning of Surtr guarding the <b>frontier</b> <b>of</b> Múspell is depicted in John Charles Dollman's painting The Giant with the Flaming Sword. Surtur, a natural satellite of the planet Saturn, and Surt, a volcano on the planet Jupiter's moon Io, are both named after Surtr. Surtur, a character from the American comic series Thor, is based on Surtr (1963).|$|E

5|$|The Presidio La Bahía {{was moved}} from the Guadalupe River to Goliad on the San Antonio River in 1749. Within five years, a new mission for the Karankawa tribes, Nuestra Señora del Rosario de los Cuhanes, was built {{upstream}} of the presidio. This mission survived for many years. Despite the new missions and presidios, Texas {{was one of the}} least populated provinces on the northern <b>frontier</b> <b>of</b> New Spain. By 1760, almost 1,200Hispanic people lived in Texas, with half in San Antonio, 350 at Los Adaes, and 260 at La Bahía. Other Spaniards lived in what is now the El Paso area, but that was considered part of New Mexico and not part of Texas.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} region bordering Spanish and Portuguese territories in South America {{was largely}} unexplored {{at the end}} of the 17th century. Dispatched by the Spanish Crown, Jesuits explored and founded eleven settlements in 76 years in the remote Chiquitania – then known as Chiquitos – on the <b>frontier</b> <b>of</b> Spanish America. They built churches (templos) in a unique and distinct style that combined elements of native and European architecture. The indigenous inhabitants of the missions were taught European music as a means of conversion. The missions were self-sufficient, with thriving economies, and virtually autonomous from the Spanish crown.|$|E
5|$|The two German governments {{promoted}} {{very different}} views of the border. The GDR saw it as the international <b>frontier</b> <b>of</b> a sovereign state– a defensive rampart against Western aggression. In Grenzer ("Border Guard"), a 1981 East German Army propaganda film, NATO and West German troops and tanks were depicted as ruthless militarists advancing towards East Germany. Border troops interviewed in the film described {{what they saw as}} the rightfulness of their cause and the threat of Western agents, spies and provocateurs. Their colleagues killed on the border were hailed as heroes and schoolchildren in East Berlin were depicted saluting their memorial.|$|E

5|$|Three princely states {{bordering}} India—Nepal, Bhutan and Sikkim—were not {{integrated into}} the Republic of India in the period between 1947 and 1950. Nepal had been recognised by the British and the Government of India as being de jure independent. Bhutan had in the British period been considered a protectorate outside the international <b>frontier</b> <b>of</b> India. The Government of India entered into a treaty with Bhutan in 1949 continuing this arrangement, and providing that Bhutan would abide by {{the advice of the}} Government of India in the conduct of its external affairs.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, Capper was {{attached}} to the force dispatched to the Tirah Campaign on the North-West <b>Frontier</b> <b>of</b> British India. One of his tasks there was to supervise the construction of the first road for wheeled vehicles across the Khyber pass. At the campaign's successful conclusion, he was promoted to major and transferred to South Africa while his wife Edith Mary (neé Beausire) and their son John Beausire Copeland Capper returned to England. Arriving in South Africa at the outbreak of the Second Boer War, Capper became deputy assistant director of railways, a vital job given the lengthy and dangerous supply routes along which the war was fought. In 1900, he received the brevet rank of lieutenant colonel and commanded several locally raised units, eventually becoming the commandant at Johannesburg. He returned to England in June 1902, following the end of hostilities the previous month, and on 31 October 1902 was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB).|$|E
5|$|In October 1886 Britain {{declared}} the Line {{to be the}} provisional <b>frontier</b> <b>of</b> British Guiana, and in February 1887 Venezuela severed diplomatic relations. Proposals for a renewal of relations and settlement of the dispute failed repeatedly, and by summer 1894, diplomatic relations had been severed for seven years, the dispute having dragged on for half a century. In addition, both sides had established police or military stations at key points in the area, partly to defend claims to the Caratal goldfield of the region's Yuruari basin, which was within Venezuelan territory but claimed by the British. The mine at El Callao, started in 1871, was for a time {{one of the richest}} in the world, and the goldfields as a whole saw over a million ounces exported between 1860 and 1883. The gold mining was dominated by immigrants from the British Isles and the British West Indies, giving an appearance of almost creating an English colony on Venezuelan territory.|$|E
