30|$|There are {{at least}} six load factors drivers in the airline industry. The first driver is the industry’s output {{decisions}} relative to demand growth. The output growth must be brought into alignment with demand growth. The second driver is pricing. Fare reductions generally stimulate demand. Load factors are affected depending upon capacity decisions. The third driver is the traffic mix. Historically, the higher the proportion of business travellers carried by an airline, the lower the average seat factor. That is, the random element in demand for business travels (highly volatile demand) suggests a lower average load factor in business and first class cabins [31]. The fourth driver is refund policies. A carrier taking non-refundable payment {{at the time of}} reservation is likely to have relatively few no-shows and a relatively higher seat factor than carriers selling a high portion of <b>fully</b> <b>flexible</b> <b>tickets.</b> The fifth driver is commercial success. A success of product design, promotions, marketing communications, distributions, and service delivery will influence load factors. The sixth driver is revenue management. The effectiveness of revenue management systems (RMS) will influence load factors. The RMS capabilities, specifically the refinement of demand forecasting tools, will contribute significantly [30]. Depending on market conditions in the airline industry, there exist a trade-off between load and yield. Unless demand is particularly strong and output growth is under firm control, it is likely that rising yields will be associated with downward pressure on load factors. In contrast, a falling yield tends to be associated with higher load factors. The trade-off suggests that airline carriers will generally want to arrive at a capacity, which targets a load factor balances between the costs of turning passengers away and the costs of meeting all peak demand and oversupplying the market (“double-edged sword”). In general, therefore, from an operational perspective it is easier to manage an airline when load factors are at 64  % than when they are at 84  % [9]. The size of the load factor is therefore a measure of success in the airline industry. However, the success factor is challenged by the fact that demand is volatile and fluctuates in units of single seat-departures in different origin and destination markets. In contrast, the capacity can only be delivered in units of available aircrafts for the particular flight-leg. That is, routes designed to serve the origin and destination markets are broadly fixed in the short run. Furthermore, the necessity to maintain both high flight completion rates, the integrity of network connections, and aircraft/crew assignments, may make it almost impossible for a scheduled passenger carrier to cancel a significant number of its lightly loaded flights [4].|$|R

40|$|The {{generalized}} entropy theory (GET) {{offers many}} insights into how molecular parameters influence polymer glass-formation. Given {{the fact that}} chain rigidity often plays {{a critical role in}} understanding the glass-formation of polymer materials, the GET was originally developed based on models of semiflexible chains. Consequently, all previous calculations within the GET considered polymers with some degree of chain rigidity. Motivated by unexpected results from computer simulations of <b>fully</b> <b>flexible</b> polymer melts concerning the dependence of thermodynamic and dynamic properties on the cohesive interaction strength (ϵ), the present paper employs the GET to explore the influence of ϵ on glass-formation in models of polymer melts with a vanishing bending rigidity, i. e., <b>fully</b> <b>flexible</b> polymer melts. In accord with simulations, the GET for <b>fully</b> <b>flexible</b> polymer melts predicts that basic dimensionless thermodynamic properties (such as the thermal expansion coefficient and isothermal compressibility) are universal functions of the temperature scaled by ϵ in the regime of low pressures. Similar scaling behavior is also found for the configurational entropy density in the GET for <b>fully</b> <b>flexible</b> polymer melts. Moreover, we find that the characteristic temperatures of glass-formation increase linearly with ϵ and that the fragility is independent of ϵ in <b>fully</b> <b>flexible</b> polymer melts, predictions that are again consistent with simulations of glass-forming polymer melts composed of <b>fully</b> <b>flexible</b> chains. Beyond an explanation of these general trends observed in simulations, the GET for <b>fully</b> <b>flexible</b> polymer melts predicts the presence of a positive residual configurational entropy at low temperatures, indicating a return to Arrhenius relaxation in the low temperature glassy state.

40|$|NpT {{ensemble}} Monte Carlo simulations {{were performed}} for <b>fully</b> <b>flexible</b> Lennard-Jones chains in the solid phase. The bond length between monomers within the chains is fixed to L=σ and the molecule {{is free to}} adopt any configuration. The solid structure of <b>fully</b> <b>flexible</b> chains is obtained by randomly locating the bonds of the chain within a face centered cubic close packed arrangement of atoms. For <b>fully</b> <b>flexible</b> chains {{it is believed that}} the stable solid phase is disordered. Such a solid is considered in this work. Computer simulations were performed for chains with m= 3, 4 and 5 monomer units, and results were obtained for the equation of state and internal energy of the chains. An extension of Wertheim's TPT 1 to the solid phase of Lennard-Jones chains (C. Vega, F. J. Blas and A. Galindo, J. Chem. Phys., 116, 7645, 2002) has been proposed recently. The simulation results of this work provide a check on the performance of this theory. It is found that Wertheim's TPT 1 successfully predicts the equation of state and internal energies of <b>fully</b> <b>flexible</b> LJ chains in the solid phase. Finally, a rigid LJ chain in a linear configuration has been considered. Computer simulations were also performed for the rigid chain in an ordered solid structure.

40|$|Abstract — Introducing a WDM {{dimension}} {{on the top}} of a TDM PON {{system is}} a natural evolution to increase the capacity of an optical access network, and this can also offer additional flexibility options. Several hybrid WDM/TDM PON architectures can be designed, each with a different degree of flexibility, going from fully static, over partially <b>flexible</b> to <b>fully</b> <b>flexible</b> architectures. The more flexible architectures, however, are either more expensive, experience a higher power loss or are less secure. A question that arises is if a <b>fully</b> <b>flexible</b> architecture is really needed, or if a partially flexible architecture already can serve several flexibility advantages, like energy efficiency, network migration and network extensibility. An important assessment parameter is the number of needed wavelengths at a certain network load. For a <b>fully</b> <b>flexible</b> architecture, it is clear that the number of needed wavelengths can be optimall...|$|R

40|$|<b>Fully</b> <b>flexible</b> {{business}} class and “full economy” airline tickets {{are aimed at}} {{meeting the needs of}} business travellers whose travel requirements may change after a ticket is purchased. The provision of these products has implications for airlines’ revenue management systems, which may lead to overbooking and denied boarding. Low-cost carriers have developed a method by which tickets can be changed only when required. This paper investigates the usage and value of ticket flexibility by business travellers as the popularity of high fare-fully <b>flexible</b> <b>tickets</b> has fallen in recent years. A survey of 284 business travellers showed that business travellers change their flight arrangements in only 32 % of short haul trips. A stated preference study investigated the likelihood of respondents to change tickets in three hypothetical scenarios. The results indicate that to extend a business trip for business purposes travellers are confident that their company will bear the cost of changing a ticket valuing additional time at about £ 54 per hour but that the value of personal time when travelling is fairly low at £ 15 per hour. The study concludes that business travellers do not need to change their tickets often and that when they do, low-cost carriers offer a more cost-efficient method of providing ticket flexibility. This pay-for-usage approach to ticket flexibility undermines the traditional airlines’ pricing structures and this has contributed to the reduced, relative value of {{business class}} and full economy class tickets for short haul air travel...|$|R

40|$|At {{the moment}} the airline {{industry}} has to cope with low load factors and especially network-carriers have to face low yields. This thesis introduces <b>flexible</b> time-range <b>tickets</b> as a new ticket type which does not specify the actual routing for a flight from A to B {{at the time of}} purchase. Therefore, it is offered to time insensitive passengers at a discount. A certain time prior to departure, passengers are assigned to a specific flight with ample capacity based on more accurate demand forecasts. The goal of the author was to find out if <b>flexible</b> time-range <b>tickets</b> would be accepted by customers and how they would have to be designed. In order to answer these questions, the author provides a theoretical background about how consumers and airlines deal with uncertainty {{in the first part of}} the paper. It has been conducted on the basis of relevant literature such as recent journal articles, books and an interview with an airline representative. The analysis itself consists of a qualitative study on the acceptance of <b>flexible</b> timerange <b>tickets.</b> It is based on eleven in-depth interviews with persons who could represent potential customers of <b>flexible</b> time-range <b>tickets.</b> The author found out that <b>flexible</b> time-range <b>tickets</b> would be accepted by a number of potential customers if certain restrictions and requirement are met by the airlines.
