40|$|An optimal {{technology}} can be determined, among various choices, for manufacturing phytopharmaceutical products by using the model of project profile and risk analysis of investment (comparative analysis of the project value). This technology takes into account different targets: marketing natural and social ones. The production is desirable for producers in Serbia to increase the accumulation of capital. The realization of profit {{in the production of}} these products also has ethical reasons because the income is distributed among research, development and social activities. This paper presents some results of research and practice regarding the manufacture of phytotherapy products, which can be useful for managers working on problems of technological restructuring as follows: 1. The feasability study for this production shows that the profit margin is between 10 and 25 %. 2. The know-how for the production of phytotherapy products ranges from 12. 5 to 25. 5 % of the total investment in new technology, which can be a great advantage in the development of original (domestic) technology and its export to other countries (example Hemofarm). 3. The development of these products and realized profit improve research for new indication and initiate the production of other <b>equipment</b> (machines <b>for</b> <b>packing,</b> transport etc) Furthermore, some extremely passive regions could be incorporated into such production. The production of phytopharmacy products has a social target supplying the market with cheap medical compounds obtained from plants without any undesired side effects in the treatment...|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{describes how}} we have constructed sport psychology as mental <b>equipment</b> <b>for</b> adolescent athletes living in northwest New South Wales (NSW). Using local materials readily found in Moree, Gunnedah, Tenterfield and other towns in northwest NSW, {{we have been able}} to introduce adolescent athletes living in regional, rural, and remote NSW to basic sport psychology concepts using mental equipment packs. These low-tech, low-cost, and local resources contrast sharply with the high-tech, high-cost, and imported physical <b>equipment</b> required <b>for</b> most sports. We produced the first mental <b>equipment</b> <b>packs</b> <b>for</b> $ 1. 06 in 2003, and we have continued to use them with athletes and their families and friends via the Northern Inland Academy of Sport (NIAS) Regional Athlete Coach Education (RACE) program. This high-cost/low-cost contrast is an important asset in constructing sport psychology as accessible to regional, rural, and remote athletes, and their families and communities. We understand that these packs, and the service delivery system that accompanies them, is the first program specifically designed for regional, rural, and remote athletes. This work is unconventional because it puts aside the orthodox view that equates basic sport psychology with mental skills. It does this by questioning the view that mental skills are the dialogical opposite to the physical skills needed for success in sport...|$|R

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis deals with potentials of methods for cleaning of flue gas from pollutants such as acidic components. Wet method of {{flue gas cleaning}} is analysed in detail with special focus on elimination of sulphur dioxide (SO 2). Introduction presents {{advantages and disadvantages of}} thermal processing of waste and production of undesired pollutants. Following parts comprise facts about main pollutants produced from incineration. Legislation providing for emission of gaseous pollutants from incinerators is also given. Chapter concerning methods of pollutants elimination is mostly focused on absorption (wet and/or semidry scrubber) and adsorption methods. Several up-to-date technological procedures are mentioned; they have a multifunctional effect such as elimination of acidic components, heavy metals, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxines and dibenzo-furanes from flue gas using single injection of suspense. Elimination of mercury (Hg) is among the technologies for heavy metal elimination which is described in detail. Main part of the thesis is related to experiments at two-stage flue gas cleaning equipment. Function of this experimental unit is described along with methods for measurement of individual quantities and detailed description of all the equipment and its components. Experimental measurements carried out at this equipment are explicated and assessed. Along with experimental work, the author has created a simulation model of wet flue gas cleaning in ChemCad programme. Particular operational parameters were tested on this model. This thesis contains results of the measurement which provide background for verification of the mathematical model. Further, the balance of heavy metals conducted on the basis of measurements in waste incinerator is displayed. Main contribution of the thesis may be summed up as follows: ­ Author has designed and constructed experimental <b>equipment</b> <b>for</b> two stage flue gas cleaning. ­ He also formed calculation for pressure drop of O-element prototype <b>equipment</b> and <b>for</b> <b>packing</b> column with FLEXIPAC structured packing. ­ He created data file with measurements at the experimental unit. ­ He determined temperature at outlet of a random device where liquid is injected into stream of hot flue gas. ­ He designed a simulation model which is identical with experimental equipment and which usage enabled comparison of measured and calculated data; it also serves as a basis for industrial applications. ­ Last part deals with creation off heavy metals balance in a case industrial waste incinerator...|$|R

40|$|Background and Purpose: The South-east Europe (SEE) {{region is}} facing a new market economy era where {{establishing}} new businesses is more than needed in all sectors. The forest sector, faced with new market emerging opportunities, {{is affected by the}} constant increase of a number of forest related enterprises. This paper describes the challenges and opportunities related to the use of marketing tools for improving business of the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) dealing with non-wood forest products (NWFPs) in SEE region. The research on this subject in the SEE region is scarce despite the rich biodiversity as a solid base for establishing eco-businesses. Materials and Methods: The method used in this paper is quantitative, based on survey data collected from enterprises in the NWFPs sector followed by statistical data analyses using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). The survey was conducted during 2011 and 2012 in four SEE countries: Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Macedonia. Results: The results showed that developed channels of distribution, branding and advertising of NWFPs are recognized in all countries as important and very important, but these marketing tools are used only few times per year. The majority of respondents pointed out advertising as the most frequently used and as the most successful tool. Interviewees’ future investments are to be focused on improving <b>equipment</b> <b>for</b> drying, <b>packing,</b> refrigerating and transport. Several entrepreneurs from Macedonia pointed out that they would invest in increasing the number of buying points and herb plantations while almost all Croatian entrepreneurs will invest in advertising, branding and promotion. Majority of respondents from Serbia are also of the opinion that financial resources should be invested in new <b>equipment.</b> The reasons <b>for</b> these investments can be summarized in reducing costs and increasing profit or in faster turnover. Conclusions: The use of marketing tools is important because they have positive influence on sale, improve communication and cooperation between enterprises and with consumers, build reliable buyers and increase the number of consumers, which leads to higher profit and creates new opportunities for NWFPs based enterprises. Intensive use of promotion tools should be seen as an opportunity for these enterprises in the SEE region to overcome current challenges and improve their business. The main reason for this situation, as it was stated in the interviews, is {{the fact that most of}} the enterprises do not have a final product. Another reason is lack of funds, because of which the question: “If you have financial sources where you should invest?” was answered with promotion, branding and other marketing tools...|$|R
