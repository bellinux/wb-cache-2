The film released on 28 December 2012 in Bangladesh [...] and premiered on 5 May 2013 at the Wilshire theater of Beverly Hills, LA. In the same year, she signed for another film Putro Ekhon Poysawala directed by Nargis Akter and starring prominent actress Bobita, Mamnun Hasan Emon, Farah Ruma and Omar Ayaz Oni.

We call local degeneracy for one of a non-ideal behavior of Monte Carlo methods. We show some equivalent conditions for local degeneracy. As an application we study a Gibbs sampler (data augmentation) for cumulative logit model with or without marginal augmentation. It is well known that natural Gibbs sampler does not work well for this model. In a sense of local consistency and degeneracy, marginal augmentation is shown to improve the asymptotic property. However, when the number of categories is large, both methods are not locally consistent. Comment: 30 pages, 3 figure...|$|E

40|$|Genomes are now {{routinely}} being determing {{for large}} sets of individuals within a population and methods to analyze {{these have been}} investigated. Such analyzes can estimate the fundamental parameters of the population model describing the population or aloow ancestral analysis: statements about historical path of the genomes and genes, which can reveal events of interests such as migrations and selective sweeps. The ideal structure to describe the relationship among the genomes is the ancestral recombination graph (ARG) that was first described by Griffiths (1982) and Hudson (1983). However, <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>reason</b> making precise statements about the ARG is unrealistic. One reason is that all knowledge obtained from the genomes are at best the local trees for all genomic regions, but local trees don’t determine the ARG. A second reason is that obtaining the local trees is computationally very demanding. Thus investing approximate but fast methods to local trees are of great interest. One first natural approximation is to discretize the continuous time in the local trees. This has been explored in the so-called coaHMMs (). Even if only the topologies of were registered for the local trees, {{there is a very}} large number of these. However, it is expected from coalescent theory that these tree topologies contains sub-trees with very short branches that rarely changes as we move along the genomes and what really is of interest is th...|$|E

40|$|Hilary Putnam’s ‘Psychological Predicates’ (1967) {{represents}} the first formalization {{of the argument}} for the multiple realizability theory (MRT) of mental states. Few years later, Jerry Fodor (1974) conceived the generalised version of the MRT over times which supported the irreducibility of ‘special sciences’ as the necessary consequence of Putnam’s theory. Every science grounded {{on the study of}} the mind became autonomous from any fixed ‘bridge law’ that could bind it to physics. Recently, some philosophers have challenged the likelihood of the argument (Zangwill 1992, Shapiro 2000) whilst others have stressed the failures of the predictions implied by the generalised theory (Bechtel and Mundale, 1999). My contribution to the controversy consists in a connectionist perspective that helps in showing two weak points in the standard approach to the MRT. Firstly, philosophers usually forget that Turing machines cannot compute (or simulate) every possible mathematical function and it is still to demonstrate if they are able to perform the mathematical functions computed by neural systems. Such a result may be only achieved using a mathematical approach to the processes implemented by parallel systems and there are good reasons to believe that the unique features showed by these systems cannot be simulated in any serial devices. Secondly, the possibility to isolate single parts of a complex system identifying their functions, should be rejected <b>for</b> <b>several</b> <b>reason,</b> the most important being that such functions lead to partial descriptions of the system itself. These descriptions may be useful in some contexts (i. e. if we {{do not have access to}} complete descriptions), but they fail to give us exhaustive explanations and should be considered weak as the ground for an explanatory model. In conclusion, I claim that a complete description of an information processing system relies on the formalization of the ‘mathematical functions’ it realizes (i. e. the mathematical description of the processes implemented by the system). This formalization can only be achieved studying the physical matter that generates the mathematical functions...|$|E
40|$|The VEGF/VEGF {{receptor}} {{system is}} the most prominent and relevant angiogenic system which has been characterized in human tumors. <b>For</b> <b>several</b> <b>reason</b> this system appears to be suited to function as target for anti-angiogenic tumor therapies. Within this project we evaluated the use single chain antibodies (scFv) which specifically recognize the VEGF receptors as therapeutically genes when expressed intracellular together with a endoplasmatic reticulum retention signal. Within this project we accomplished the following steps: - Highly purified extracellular domains of VEGF receptor 1 and VEGF receptor 2 {{have been used to}} gain monoclonal antibodies (mabs). - The mabs were characterised with respect to specificity, affinity and the ability to recognize the native proteins. - Starting from the hybridoma cell lines which expressed appropriate mabs we cloned first the variable regions of the IgG gene and further the corresponding single chain antibodies (scFv). - The cloned scFv were expressed as recombinant proteins, purified and their characteristics were compared with those of the mother mabs. - Suitable scFv were further modified by the addition of a signal peptide and a KDEL sequence for intracellular expression and stably transfected in VEGF receptor overexpressing CHO cells. Expression of scFv protein was monitored by the detection of a 'mycepitope' which had been cloned in front of the coding region of the scFv. - Using this cellular system we were able to demonstrate that the intracellular expression of scFv recognizing the extracellular domain of the VEGF receptor lead to the supression of the receptor expression of the cell surface. Furthermore we could demonstrate that this was accompanied by the inhibition of VEGF induced receptor activation. Thus we could show within this project that the intracellular expression of specific scFv are useful tools to block VEGF induced VEGF receptor activation and might be used in gentherapeutic approaches targeting tumor angiogenesis.
