5000|$|Cape horse {{mackerel}} is a bycatch {{species in the}} offshore demersal trawl, which operates mainly off {{the waters of the}} Western Cape at depths of 110m and deeper. The offshore demersal trawl fishery operates using trawl nets which are dragged behind the boat along the ocean floor at depths from 110 - 800 m. Cape {{horse mackerel}} caught in the midwater trawl fishery are considered to be more sustainable than those caught in the offshore trawl fishery (see Cape horse mackerel assessment for midwater trawl). This fishery primarily targets <b>deepwater</b> <b>hake</b> (Merluccius paradoxus) on soft, sandy bottoms, as well as commercially valuable bycatch species such as kingklip (Genypterus capensis) and monkfish (Lophius vomerinus). Although trawling is a highly unselective fishing method, offshore fishing grounds are not generally very biodiverse (i.e. they are only inhabited by a few species) and the discard rate for this fishery is estimated to be 10% of the total catch. However, this fishing method is likely to have significant impacts on bottom habitats and concerns are expressed around the number of seabird mortalities caused during trawling (estimated at 8000 per year). The hake component of the offshore demersal trawl fishery has been certified by the Marine Stewardship Council since 2004, and the current management system for this fishery employs a number of ecosystem-based management measures which address issues such as bycatch, closed areas and benthic habitat impacts. The Cape horse mackerel is managed in terms of a maximum precautionary catch Limit (MPCL). The MPCL has been maintained at 44 000 tonnes in recent years and accommodates both mid-water-directed and bycatch in the hake-directed demersal trawl sector. Juvenile horse mackerel are occasionally targeted on the West Coast where a 5 000 tonnes precautionary catch limit is enforced (the whole small pelagic sector is closed if the limit is exceeded). Despite the absence of direct evidence of ecosystem change, a potential for ecosystem impact exists, as this is an important small pelagic species, and fills a similar ecosystem niche to other small pelagic species such as sardine and anchovy.|$|E

The {{two species}} of Cape hake, Merluccius capensis (shallow-water hake) and M paradoxus (<b>deepwater</b> <b>hake),</b> fomi the {{mainstay}} of the bottom trawl industry off South Africa and constitute the country's most valuable fishery. It is therefore important that the status of this resource be assessed regularly to ensure that exploitation is at a sustainable level. The two Cape hake species are morphologically similar and no distinction is made between them in commercial catch statistics. Consequently, for assessment purposes, the Cape hakes are treated as a single species. It is assumed that two stocks of Cape hake exist, one off the West Coast and another off the South Coast of South Africa. Central to the assessments of these stocks are the catch per unit effort (CPUE) data because it assumed that CPUE is proportional to abundance. The nominal CPUE (hake catch divided by actual time trawled) for both the West and South Coast stocks has shown a steady growth over the period 1978 - 1994, increasing {{at a rate of}} 3. 8 % per annum on the West Coast and 4. 2 % per annum on the South Coast. The bulk of this thesis is concerned with determining whether these increases in CPUE are the result of an increasing biomass, or are rather, in part, the result of improved vessel efficiency due to technological advancement or of changes in fishing strategy. The existing CPUE time series had previously been standardised by means of applying power factors which were crudely estimated in the early 1970 s and which are likely inappropriate for the current fishing fleets. These CPUE series have therefore been re-standardised by applying the internationally accepted approach of General Linear Modelling (GLM) ...|$|E
