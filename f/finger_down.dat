25|$|The four {{fingers of}} the left hand can each be used {{in at least two}} {{different}} positions, three {{in the case of the}} index finger. The key normally operated by this finger is primarily used for E4. (Rarely it can be used as a trill key.) This key has a small hole drilled into it. The player can lift the finger completely off the key, or press the key down, closing the hole. A third possibility is to slide the <b>finger</b> <b>down,</b> so the key remains closed, but the hole is open. The middle finger typically stays on the centre hole on the tenor joint. It can also move to a lever used for E4 and a rarely-used trill key. The ring finger operates, on most models, one key. Some models, like a Polisi Artist bassoon, have two assignments. The upper assignment is used for alternate fingerings in the alto register. The smallest finger operates two side keys on the bass joint. The lower key is typically used for C1. The upper key is used for E1, E3, F3, F3, A4, B4, B4, C4, C4, and D4.|$|E
2500|$|Cotten {{began writing}} music while toying with her older brother's banjo. She was left-handed, so {{she played the}} banjo in reverse position. Later, when she {{transferred}} her songs to the guitar, she formed a unique style, since on the banjo the uppermost string is not a bass string, but a short, high-pitched string which begins at the fifth fret. This required her to adopt a unique style for the guitar. She first played with the [...] "all <b>finger</b> <b>down</b> strokes" [...] like a banjo. Later, her playing evolved into a unique style of fingerpicking. Her signature alternating bass style {{is now known as}} [...] "Cotten picking". Her fingerpicking techniques influenced many other musicians.|$|E

2500|$|Jackson's {{performance}} of [...] "Rope Burn" [...] has influenced numerous artists to incorporate a similar routine during live shows. An anecdote stated [...] "Her {{performance of}} this song, when she brought a fan on {{stage for a}} strip tease during The Velvet Rope Tour has been co-opted {{by the likes of}} Britney Spears and Rihanna in later years." [...] Other artists observed to be inspired by the rendition include Pink, Beyoncé, Christina Aguilera, the Sugababes, Katy Perry, Nicki Minaj, and Chris Brown. Nicole Brown of Vibe stated [...] "Long before Rihanna and Nicki were handing out lap dances like hot cakes, Miss Jackson revolutionized dirty dancing with her [...] "Rope Burn" [...] routine in 1998. Janet works her way up and down a pole before laying a passionate kiss on an excited male fan." [...] A critique of Chris Brown's Fan Appreciation Tour remarked [...] "Brown isn’t the only celeb getting freaky on stage with their fans, singer Janet Jackson {{was one of the first}} celebrities to get freaky with fans on a stage in front of thousands of on-lookers." [...] Katy Perry was also thought to emulate the performance on the California Dreams Tour, in which she brought a male onstage and [...] "teasingly traced a <b>finger</b> <b>down</b> his bare chest and stomach." [...] The Guardian observed influence from Jackson in the Sugababes' performance of [...] "Virgin Sexy" [...] on the Angels with Dirty Faces Tour, [...] "in which they lapdance around the sole member of the audience who is male and in his twenties", adding [...] "It's a trick Janet Jackson did a few years ago, on her Velvet Rope tour." [...] In 2013, Wall Street International reported the performance inspired American artist (who was exhibiting I London at the time), Alex Da Corte's painting [...] "Velveteen (Wilson Kelvin McQuade)", offering the analogy [...] "a lap dance performed by one artwork for another may be crass, yet too fitting to be ignored." ...|$|E
