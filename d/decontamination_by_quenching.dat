40|$|Phenomena {{that can}} decontaminate aerosol-laden gases {{sparging}} through steam suppression pools {{of boiling water}} reactors during reactor accidents are described. Uncertainties in aerosol properties, aerosol behavior within gas bubbles, and bubble behavior in plumes affect predictions of <b>decontamination</b> <b>by</b> steam suppression pools. Uncertainties in the boundary and initial conditions that are dictated by the progression of severe reactor accidents and that will affect predictions of <b>decontamination</b> <b>by</b> steam suppression pools are discussed. Ten parameters that characterize boundary and initial condition uncertainties, nine parameters that characterize aerosol property and behavior uncertainties, and eleven parameters that characterize uncertainties {{in the behavior of}} bubbles in steam suppression pools are identified. Ranges for the values of these parameters and subjective probability distributions for parametric values within the ranges are defined. These uncertain parameters are used in Monte Carlo uncertainty analyses to develop uncertainty distributions for the decontamination that can be achieved by steam suppression pools and the size distribution of aerosols that do emerge from such pools. A simplified model of <b>decontamination</b> <b>by</b> steam suppression pools is developed by correlating features of the uncertainty distributions for total decontamination factor, DF(total), mean size of emerging aerosol particles, d{sub p}, and the standard deviation of the emerging aerosol size distribution, {sigma}, with pool depth, H. Correlations of the median values of the uncertainty distributions are suggested as the best estimate of <b>decontamination</b> <b>by</b> suppression pools. Correlations of the 10 percentile and 90 percentile values of the uncertainty distributions characterize the uncertainty in the best estimates. 295 refs., 121 figs., 113 tabs...|$|R

40|$|Received 25 April, 2009; Accepted 18 November, 2009) AbstractBackground and purpose: Parasitical {{diseases}} {{are a common}} problem in developing countries. Different shapes of parasite such as cyst, larva and egg are carried from vegetables. Leaves of Allbezia contain saponin constituents, which is effective on surface tension reduction, and is preferred to chemical washer. This research was designed to study the extracted effect of removal from vegetable and its comparison with disinfectant commercial detergent in Sari city. Materials and methods: Leaves aqueous extract (5, 10, 15, and 20) was prepared from the Allbezia julibrissin by maceration method, then 100 gram of parsley vegetable sample was taken randomly from shopping center. The sample was placed in contact with aqueous extract for 0 and 15 minutes according to the WHO guidelines. Then, the effluent was centrifuged and evaluated qualitatively and quantitavely for parasite <b>decontamination</b> <b>by</b> Mac- Master counting slid, (0 / 3 mm). In addition to parasite, the contamination by commercial detergent (10 %) was performed with contact times 0 and 15 minutes and also pure water as blank. Results: Maximum parasite <b>decontamination</b> <b>by</b> aqueous extract and commercial detergent 10 % at 0 minute contact time was obtained 2306 and 97 parasites eggs, respectively. Also, maximum parasite <b>decontamination</b> <b>by</b> watery extract and commercial detergent 10 % and blank water at 15 minute contact time was obtained 3022, 11, 64 parasite ova, respectively. In this research, the best parasites <b>decontamination</b> range <b>by</b> aqueous extract was obtained at all concentration with contact time of 15 minutes. Conclusion: Quantitatively, rate of parasite ova decontamination from vegetables sample by aqueous extract of Allbezia in all concentration and 15 contact times {{was more than the}} commercial washer.

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{it has been}} {{revealed}} that elastic modulus decreases and fluidity increases in water-saturated wood <b>by</b> <b>quenching</b> and drying history [2 – 14]. The mechanism of these phenomena is considered as follows. In the case of wood placed in an environment for a long time, molecules remain in the stable state in the humidity and temperature. However, when environment changes rapidly like quenching or drying, molecule arrangements cannot follow a new environment and become in a thermodynamic unequilibrium state (unstable state). Changes in mechanical properties caused <b>by</b> <b>quenching</b> {{have been reported in}} many studies on water-saturated wood [3 – 10]. In these studies, elastic modulus decreased largely in some cases that wood was cooled rapidly from the temperature higher than a glass transition temperature of lignin to lower temperature [5, 11].

We performed a prospective study by comparing levels of reduction of overgrowth and recovery of mycobacteria using either pretreatment with N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NALC) –NaOH alone or pretreatment with NALC-NaOH and then with oxalic acid. From 406 specimens of 148 CF patients, 11 specimens were positive for mycobacteria, 5 of which grew mycobacteria after <b>decontamination</b> <b>by</b> either procedure. Three specimens grew mycobacteria only after decontamination with NALC-NaOH, whereas three specimens grew mycobacteria only after treatment with NALC-NaOH followed by oxalic acid but were overgrown after decontamination with NALC-NaOH.
