25|$|Messerschmitt, and {{subsequently}} FMR, made factory-converted <b>Service</b> <b>Cars</b> to {{order for the}} automobile service industry. Similar in concept to the Harley-Davidson Servi-Car and the Indian Dispatch Tow, the <b>Service</b> <b>Car</b> had a detachable tow bar and clamp, a revised front suspension to accommodate the tow bar when in use, and a storage system inside the car to accommodate the tow bar when not in use. The service technician would drive the <b>Service</b> <b>Car</b> to the customer's car and, if the customer's car was drivable, attach the tow bar {{to the front of}} the <b>Service</b> <b>Car,</b> clamp the other end of the tow bar to the bumper of the customer's car, and drive the customer's car to the garage. When the service was complete, he would drive the car back to the customer while towing the <b>Service</b> <b>Car,</b> detach the <b>Service</b> <b>Car</b> from the customer's car, and drive back to the garage.
