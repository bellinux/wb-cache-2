Plants were stunted and rosetted, and the flowers were of small size and characterized by virescence symptoms. Phytoplasma presence and identity was detected by applying PCR/RFLP techniques and sequencing of 16 S ribosomal gene. Phy-toplasmas were identified as belonging to ribosomal subgroup 16 SrII-A, never reported before in Italy and showed 99 % of ho-mology with ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma aurantifolia ’ and related phytoplasmas. This is the first report of a phytoplasma disease of tenweeks stock.

40|$|Plant water status plays a {{major role}} in <b>glasshouse</b> <b>cultivation</b> of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.). New climate control {{technologies}} alter the glasshouse climate and make it less dependent on solar radiation. However, irrigation strategies are still often based on solar radiation sums. In order to maintain a good plant water status, it is interesting to use plant-based methods such as monitoring sap flow (F) or stem diameter variations (SDV). Though SDV give important information about plant water status, an unambiguous interpretation might be difficult because other factors such as stem age, fruit load and sugar content of the stem also affect SDV. In this study, an analysis of the effect of stem age on the response of SDV to water status was performed by calibration of a mechanistic flow and storage model. This allowed us to determine how parameter values changed across the growing season. Tissue extensibility decreased over the growing season resulting in a lower growth rate potential, whereas daily cycles of shrinking and swelling of the stem became more pronounced towards the end of the growing season. Parameters were then adapted to time-dependent variables and implemented in the model, allowing long term simulation and interpretation of SDV. Sensitivity analysis showed that model predictions were very sensitive to initial sucrose content of the phloem tissue and the parameters related to plastic growth...|$|E

40|$|Grafting {{cucumbers}} onto {{low temperature}} tolerant rootstocks Cucurbita ficifolia and Sicyos angulatus promoted vegetative growth and early fruit production at suboptimal temperatures in winter. The positive effect of grafting. onto C. ficifolia on length growth and leaf initiation {{depended on the}} genotype of the scion. Lines which benefit much from the grafting may possess a relatively inefficient root system to sustain growth of the shoot. At normal growing temperature in winter, S. angulatus as a rootstock drastically reduced leaf necrosis of powdery mildew resistant cucumbers, especially when the plants were grown on rockwool. The reduction of necrosis of the leaves {{was accompanied by a}} higher fruit yield. In rockwool grown plants, the concentrations of Mg, Mn and Cu in the xylem sap were much higher in grafted plants, while no clear systematic differences were found in plants grown in soil. Further studies may possibly demonstrate a relation between these differences in the xylem sap and the intensity of necrosis. Detailed studies of rootstock-scion interactions could result in lower costs for the <b>glasshouse</b> cucumber <b>cultivation...</b>|$|R
40|$|Bush {{snap beans}} (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) cv. Larma and Montano were {{grown in the}} soil of two {{unheated}} <b>glasshouses</b> after tomato <b>cultivation,</b> and irrigated with the following nutrient media: (1) control of water only (0 : 0), (2) N:K (1 : 1), (3) N:K (1 : 3) and (4) N:K (3 : 1). Each of these irrigation treatments was applied twice a week from planting until four stages of plant growth: (1) until the start of flowering, 17 days after transplanting, (2) until 50 % of the pods had filled, 28 days after transplanting, (3) until the first-formed pods were dry, 58 days after transplanting, and (4) until harvest, 88 days after transplanting. The {{results of this study}} showed that due to a high concentration of N and K in the soil from the preceding crop, plants that were irrigated solely with water (0 : 0) had a higher number of pods, seed weight, seed size and dry weight per plant than those of the three fertilizer treatments. Irrigation of plants after 50 % of the pods had filled (28 days after transplanting) did not increase seed yield. This means that when beans are grown for seed after a fertilizer-demanding crop (e. g. tomato) and irrigation is stopped at 50 % pod-filling, significant savings of water and fertilizer may be achieved. Continuation of irrigation and nutrient application until the fourth stage (i. e. 88 days after transplanting) would seem to result in significant water and nutrient waste leading to soil and underground contamination as well as a waste of energy...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{development}} of varieties {{with a high}} content of antioxidant compounds, such as carotenoids, {{has become a major}} focus in the marketing of tomato. Several mutants have been used in the {{development of}} high pigment varieties, but the significant influence of the environment on carotenoid content and the presence of negative side effects in vegetative growth and yield have limited the success of these variants. Consequently, the identification of alternative sources of variation in the quest for high carotenoid content is ongoing. In this study, 12 accessions of Solanum lycopersicum (including the former var cerasiforme) and S. pimpinelifolium have been evaluated in three different environments: open field and <b>glasshouse</b> <b>cultivation</b> at two sites. Three accessions (BGV 6195 of S. pimpinellifolium, LA 1423 of the former var cerasiforme and LA 3633 a possible hybrid between S. pimpinellifolium and S. lycopersicum) showed outstanding and stable lycopene content, that doubled in all three environments the content of the positive control LA 3538, with the high pigment- 1 mutation (hp 1). In addition, accession CATIE 14812 would also be interesting as regards improvement of &# 946;-carotene content. These materials offer new opportunities in the development of tomato varieties with enriched and reliable carotenoid content and the close taxonomic relationship of these accessions with cultivated tomato will facilitate their use in breeding programs...|$|E
40|$|The {{genotypic}} {{potential for}} high l-ascorbic acid content of 15 accessions of S. lycopersicon and S. pimpinellifolium has been evaluated in three environments, including open-air and <b>glasshouse</b> <b>cultivation</b> and two localities. The environmental effect on l-ascorbic acid accumulation was highly genotype-dependant and the variance {{ascribed to the}} G×E environment was similar in importance to that ascribed to genotype. The variation found within accession might be ascribed to microenvironmental effects associated with temperature changes and oxidative stress or population variability. Several accessions with high genotypic values (μ+G) have been identified. Among them, accession PI 365959 of S. pimpinellifolium, showed a genotypic value of 293. 8 mg kg− 1, statistically significant higher (P < 0. 05) than the genotypic potential of controls reported to have high l-ascorbic content (CDP 4777, 115. 0 mg kg− 1). It also showed positive G×E interactions, with a relatively high stability. Accession LA 1423 of S. lycopersicon var. cerasiforme, despite being less stable, had also high genotypic values for l-ascorbic acid accumulation (197. 4 mg kg− 1). This germplasm will be of great interest {{for the development of}} new tomato cultivars targeted to added-value markets appreciating nutritional or functional quality.

This study aimed to estimate the general and specific combining abilities of coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.) by analyzing its fruit yield, essential oil content (EOC) and fatty oil content (FOC). To reach this aim, 15 half-diallel hybrids and their six parents, selected for their different response to water stress in fruit yield, essential oil and fatty oil content were evaluated under well-watered, moderate water-stressed and sever water-stressed conditions in the field and in <b>glasshouse</b> <b>cultivation</b> systems. Fruit yield in the field (FYF) and glasshouse (FYG), percent of de-hulled fruit, percent of hulls, EOC, essential oil yield (EOY), de-hulled fruit fatty oil content (DFFOC), hull fatty oil content (HFOC), fatty oil content (FOC) and fatty oil yield (FOY) were examined. Water treatment (WT), genotype and genotype × WT effects were significant (P ≤  0. 01) for all measured traits. For FYF, gene action was mostly additive while dominance was more important for FYG. Genotypes gained different EOC and FOC in different WTs. Genetic control of the EOC was affected by water stress and the portion of dominance in gene action increased as water stress progressed leading to completely dominant genetic control of EOC under severe water stress. For FOC and FOY genetic control was governed by dominant and over dominant gene nature in all WTs. Parents including P, P and P were indicated as promising hybrid contributors for high EOC, DFFOC and FOY. Similar genetic control mechanisms of the EOC, EOY, FOC and FOY suggests that improvement of essential oil content and fatty oil content could be simultaneously achieved in coriander...|$|E

40|$|An {{epidemiological}} survey on 176 soil samples, col-lected from carnation {{fields in the}} Vesuvius area (Naples, Italy) revealed, in more than 90 % of samples, the occurrence of second stage juveniles of the cyst nematode Heterodera daverti parasitized by the ne-matophagous fungus Hirsutella rhossiliensis. The diffu-sion of the fungus over the area of cultivation of carna-tion {{could account for the}} substantial decrease in severi-ty of nematode attacks, which were observed over the last five years. The influence of various factors on H. rhossiliensis-mediated suppressiveness in soils subjected to repeated treatments with fumigants is discussed. Key words: biological control, soil suppressiveness, carnation, nematophagous fungi. The first report of severe epiphytotics caused by the cyst nematode Heterodera daverti Wouts et Sturhan in cultivations of carnation in the Vesuvius area (Naples, Italy) dates back to 1983 (Ambrogioni et al., 1986). In the following years, H. daverti became the most diffuse and harmful phytoparasitic nematode on carnation, ful-ly replacing the previously reported species: the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita (Kofoid et White) Chitwood and Paratylenchus dianthus Jenkins (D’Errico et al., 1985; D’Errico et al., 1987). One reason for the turnover among nematode species could be the repeated use of nematicides which fully control M. incognita and P. dianthus but not H. daverti whose eggs are retained within a cyst and also laid outside within a gelatinous matrix which confer a degree of protection to them. The soil type in the mentioned area is particulary suitable for the development of H. daverti (D’Errico et al., 1987), which proved not to be controlled by a single treatment even with high dosages of fumigant nemati-cides before set up of the crop, and required repeated applications with non-fumigant nematicides during cul-tivation.

40|$|Whether a {{voluntary}} environmental agreement succeeds is partly {{determined by the}} possibility of legally enforcing the obligations which it establishes. Despite the fact that the importance of enforcing voluntary agreements is underlined by the Dutch government, enforcement of these agreements is not always (clearly) guaranteed in practice, especially from a legal viewpoint. Apparently there is uncertainty concerning the possibility to enforce. This uncertainty is not only due to the enforcement mechanisms which are to be applied, but also to aspects that affect the enforceability of voluntary environmental agreements. Aspects of enforceability concern for example the parties, the legal character and the obligations which {{a voluntary}} agreement estbalishes. In addition to discussing the enforceability and enforcement of this instrument in a general sense, four specific voluntary agreements in the field of climate policy have been analysed in detail. These are the Long-Term Agreements on Energy-Efficiency 2001 - 2012, the Energy-Efficiency Benchmarking Agreement, the Agreement on <b>Glasshouse</b> <b>Cultivation</b> and the Environment and the Agreement on Coal-Fired Power Stations and CO 2 -reduction. These voluntary agreements are used in the Netherlands to implement the Kyoto Protocol. The enforceability and enforcement of voluntary agreements and of voluntary climate agreements in particular has been tested against the requirements of the Dutch democratic rule-of-law state. These requirements are: the principle of legal certainty, the equality principle, the requirement that the authorities are bound by the law, the protection of fundamental rights, the principle of democracy, judicial control and the principle of serving the government. In general, it may be concluded that the enforceability of voluntary environmental agreements under the law currently in force to a certain degree fulfils or is able to fulfil the requirements set for enforceability by the democratic rule of law principles. This general statement is supported by the analysis of the four voluntary climate agreements. It further generally emerges that the parties to a voluntary agreement are quite free to determine to what extent they will give substance to aspects of enforceability and that for this reason it is nog guaranteed that the requirements of the democratic rule of law will be respected. This also emerges from the analysis of the four voluntary climate agreements. If the parties fail to fulfil these requirements, they do not immediately act contrary to objective law. Also because of tensions between the application of democratic rule-of-law requirements it is not always possible to completely meet all the requirements set. If possible, a balance should be found in applying these requirements then. Overviewing the various possible paths to enforcement it can generally be concluded that in theory at least sufficient possibilities exist for both actual parties and third parties to enforce obligations from voluntary environmental agreements and that it is clear which enforcement mechanisms may be applied. The enforcement mechanisms cannot, however, just be applied simultaneously or consecutively; there are issues of harmonization between the different mechanisms. Furthermore, it is too a large extent dependent upon the parties to what degree the possibilities for enforcement method can and will be used...|$|E
