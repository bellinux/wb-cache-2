25|$|Gilliam and Lamp {{were driven}} to the San Gabriel Mountains, where they were held captive for almost two days, being bound and gagged between {{repeated}} instances of sexual and physical abuse. Both men slept in the van alongside their two hostages, with each alternatively acting as a lookout. On one occasion, Bittaker walked Lamp onto a nearby hill and forced her to pose for pornographic pictures before returning her to the van. Bittaker also informed Norris to take several Polaroid pictures of himself and Gilliam, both nude and clothed. In {{the first of three}} instances in which Bittaker raped Gilliam, he also created a tape recording of himself raping her, forcing the girl to pretend she was his cousin and informing Gilliam to feel free to express her pain. (Bittaker later claimed he buried the tape in a cemetery. The tape recording of Gilliam's rape was never found.) Bittaker is also known to have tortured Gilliam by stabbing her breasts with an ice pick and using vise <b>grip</b> <b>pliers</b> to tear off part of one nipple.|$|E
5000|$|Tools {{may include}} cutting {{tools such as}} saws, axes and hatchets; {{mechanical}} advantage aids such as a pry bar or wrecking bar, ropes, pulleys, or a 'come-a-long" [...] hand-operated winch; construction tools such as pliers, chisels, a hammer, screwdrivers, a hand-operated twist drill, vise <b>grip</b> <b>pliers,</b> glue, nails, nuts, bolts, and screws; mechanical repair tools such as an arc welder, an oxy-acetylene torch, a propane torch with a spark lighter, a solder iron and flux, wrench set, a nut driver, a tap and die set, a socket set, and a fire extinguisher. As well, some survivalists bring barterable items such as fishing line, liquid soap, insect repellent, light bulbs, can openers, extra fuels, motor oil, and ammunition.|$|E

50|$|Techniques {{now include}} the use of {{traditional}} forging tools like various types of hammers, mallets, and anvils. Other tools consist of rolling mills, vice <b>grips,</b> <b>pliers,</b> embedding wire, other objects into the folds. and a heat source. The heat source can be some kind of forge, a blowtorch, or anything hot enough to anneal the metal.|$|R
50|$|A helical insert is {{an insert}} made of coiled wire. The {{helically}} formed coils of diamond shaped stainless steel or phosphor bronze wire screw into a threaded hole {{to form a}} mating internal thread for a screw or stud. These inserts provide a convenient means of repairing stripped-out threads and are also used to provide stronger threads in soft materials such as aluminium, zinc die castings, wood, magnesium etc. than {{can be obtained by}} direct tapping of the base metal involved. Another common generic name is screw thread insert (STI), although many users persist in calling them all by a prominent brand name, the registered trademark Heli-Coil. Applications include engine cylinder head repair after unintentional over-torquing or cross-threading of spark plugs strips the thread of the socket. Kits with matched tap and coil exist for this. The straight radial piece in the photo is the driver tang which is used as a key to <b>grip</b> with <b>pliers</b> for driving the coil into place and is discarded after installation.|$|R
40|$|The {{function}} of the human hand {{in terms of the}} discrete movement of the joints and the action of individual muscles is well enough understood. Little is known, however, of the movements of the hand as a whole. It is possible to talk loosely of closing, opening or cupping the hand; of selected postures such as the pinch or hook or of prehensile functions such as grasping and gripping. These terms are not only unscientific but have little or no universal connotation. The need for a system of disability evaluation of the hand in connection with industrial and insurance work has resulted in the development of several methods of analysing the {{function of}} the hand as a unit. Griffiths (1943 and personal communications) has for many years divided the functions of the hand into cylinder grip, ball grip, ring grip, pincer <b>grip</b> and <b>pliers</b> <b>grip.</b> These terms, although expressive and useful are somewhat selective in that they represent a series of functional end-results rather than a fundamental analysis of the potential of the hand as a whole. The units of function devised by Slocum and Pratt (1946) namely, grasp, pinch and hook-are not clearly defined nor are they comprehensive, for no allowance appears to be made, for instance, for the numerous functions of the hand in which the thumb is not in opposition. The classification proposed by McB ride (1942) divides the functions of the hand into three types: grasping by the hand as a whole, grasping between the thumb and fingers and grasping by the combined use of the palm and the digits. These three types of movement are somewhat arbitrarily conceived and do not appear to have any particular functional or anatomical basis. A terminology, {{if it is to be}} effective and generally acceptable, must develop out of a fundamental approach to the problem of the {{function of the}} hand as a whole and it seems that little has been done in this respect. The purpose of this paper is to present a method of classifying prehensile movements based on such an approach. The two discrete patterns of movement that have emerged through this study are analysed from both the anatomical and functional points of view and are termed precision grip and power grip...|$|R
