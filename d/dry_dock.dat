5|$|On 4 March 1907 Iéna {{was moved}} into <b>dry</b> <b>dock</b> No. 2 in the Missiessy Basin at Toulon to undergo {{maintenance}} of her hull {{as well as}} inspection of her rudder shaft. Eight days later, beginning at 1:35a.m. and continuing until 2:45, a series of explosions began in the port No. 5 100-millimetre magazine of Iéna which devastated the ship and the surrounding area. Because the ship was in a <b>dry</b> <b>dock</b> it was initially impossible to flood the magazines. The commanding officer of the battleship , which was moored nearby, fired a shell into {{the gate of the}} <b>dry</b> <b>dock</b> in an attempt to flood it, but the shell ricocheted without holing the gate. The dock was finally flooded when Ensign de Vaisseau Roux (who was killed shortly afterward by fragments from the ship) managed to open the sluice gates. The , moored in the No. 1 dock beside Iéna, almost capsized under the strength of the blasts.|$|E
5|$|The St Nazaire Raid or Operation Chariot was a {{successful}} British amphibious attack on the heavily defended Normandie <b>dry</b> <b>dock</b> at St Nazaire in German-occupied France during the Second World War. The operation was undertaken by the Royal Navy and British Commandos {{under the auspices of}} Combined Operations Headquarters on 28 March 1942. St Nazaire was targeted because the loss of its <b>dry</b> <b>dock</b> would force any large German warship in need of repairs, such as the 's sister ship , to return to home waters via either the English Channel or the GIUK gap, both of which were heavily defended by British units including the Royal Navy's Home Fleet, rather than having a haven available on the Atlantic coast in Nazi-occupied France.|$|E

40|$|Port Weller <b>Dry</b> <b>Docks</b> Limited {{was officially}} {{established}} on April 25, 1946, near Lock 1 of the Welland Canal. Charles A. Ansell was the company’s first President and General Manager. Initially, the company focused on repairing ships, but in June, 1951, built their first ship, the Scott Misener. In 1956, the Upper Lakes and St. Lawrence Transportation Co. purchased {{all of the}} shares of Port Weller <b>Dry</b> <b>Docks</b> Limited. In the mid-eighties, ULS (Upper Lakes Shipping) International (which owned the Port Weller <b>dry</b> <b>docks),</b> and Canada Steamship Lines, merged their operations. As a result, the Port Weller <b>Dry</b> <b>Docks</b> became a division of this newly formed company, known as Canadian Shipbuilding and Engineering Limited. In 2007, Seaway Marine & Industrial Inc. took over ownership of the Port Weller <b>Dry</b> <b>Docks,</b> but declared bankruptcy in July 2013. This collection contains 5 programs of the Commissioning and Christening Ceremonies held at the Port Weller <b>Dry</b> <b>Docks</b> for vessels built or refitted there.

The ship's first commander was Captain George A. Converse. Illinois {{was the first}} member of her class to be authorized, but the last to enter service. After commissioning, the ship began a shakedown cruise in the Chesapeake Bay, followed by initial training. She left the area on 20 November to test a new floating <b>dry</b> <b>dock</b> in Algiers, Louisiana. The ship was back in Newport News in January 1902. She served briefly as the flagship of Rear Admiral Robley D. Evans from 15 to 28 February; during this period, she took part in a reception for Prince Henry of Prussia, the brother of the German Kaiser.|$|E
