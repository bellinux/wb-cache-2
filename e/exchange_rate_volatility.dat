5|$|Both the 1930s episode and the {{outbreak}} of competitive devaluation that began in 2009 occurred during global economic downturns. An important difference with the 2010s period is that international traders are much better able to hedge their exposures to <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>volatility</b> due to more sophisticated financial markets. A second difference is that during the later period devaluations have invariably been effected by nations expanding their money supplies—either by creating money to buy foreign currency, {{in the case of}} direct interventions, or by creating money to inject into their domestic economies, with quantitative easing. If all nations try to devalue at once, the net effect on exchange rates could cancel out leaving them largely unchanged, but the expansionary effect of the interventions would remain. So while there has been no collaborative intent, some economists such as Berkeley's Barry Eichengreen and Goldman Sachs's Dominic Wilson have suggested the net effect will be similar to semi-coordinated monetary expansion which will help the global economy.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{dominance}} of flexible exchange rate regimes, the foreign exchange markets became significantly more volatile. In 1980, newly elected U.S. President Ronald Reagan's administration brought about increasing balance of payments deficits and budget deficits. To finance these deficits, the United States offered artificially high real interest rates to attract large inflows of foreign capital. As foreign investors' demand for U.S. dollars grew, the dollar's value appreciated substantially until reaching its peak in February 1985. The U.S. trade deficit grew to $160 billion in 1985 ($341 billion in 2012 dollars) {{as a result of}} the dollar's strong appreciation. The G5 met in September 1985 at the Plaza Hotel in New York City and agreed that the dollar should depreciate against the major currencies to resolve the United States' trade deficit and pledged to support this goal with concerted foreign exchange market interventions, in what became known as the Plaza Accord. The U.S. dollar continued to depreciate, but industrialized nations became increasingly concerned that it would decline too heavily and that <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>volatility</b> would increase. To address these concerns, the G7 (now G8) held a summit in Paris in 1987, where they agreed to pursue improved exchange rate stability and better coordinate their macroeconomic policies, in what became known as the Louvre Accord. This accord became the provenance of the managed float regime by which central banks jointly intervene to resolve under- and overvaluations in the foreign exchange market to stabilize otherwise freely floating currencies. Exchange rates stabilized following the embrace of managed floating during the 1990s, with a strong U.S. economic performance from 1997 to 2000 during the Dot-com bubble. After the 2000 stock market correction of the Dot-com bubble the country's trade deficit grew, the September 11 attacks increased political uncertainties, and the dollar began to depreciate in 2001.|$|E

40|$|First draft Transition to {{floating}} <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> regimes {{has led to}} sharp {{increases in}} nominal and real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>volatilities</b> with no corresponding changes {{in the distribution of}} macroeconomic fundamentals. This paper investigates the so called <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> disconnect puzzle by focusing attention on the amplified effects of monetary shocks on <b>exchange</b> <b>rates.</b> In the wake of Obstfeld and Rogoff [1995], recent international business cycle literature puts forward two types of explanation. Either frictions on the goods market or on the credit market are considered as good candidates to rationalize the <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> movements. The paper goes one step further. Based on the intuition that both types of imperfections are complementary, it sheds light on the combined role that pricing-to-market and limited participation to the credit market play in the explanation to the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> disconnect puzzle. I develop a two-country general equilibrium model with pricing-to-market and credit market rigidities. Given both types of frictions, monetary shocks generate a nominal <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> overshooting which raises the nominal and real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>volatilities.</b> The model built on limited participation and pricing-to-market improves our understanding of the huge observed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> fluctuations...|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} early {{skepticism}} {{on the merits}} of floating <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes in emerging markets, 8 of the 25 largest countries in this group have now had a floating <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime for more than a decade. Using parsimonious VAR specifications covering the period of floating <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> this study computes the dynamics of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> pass-throughs to consumer price indices. We find that pass-throughs have typically been moderate even though emerging floaters have seen considerable nominal and real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>volatilities.</b> Previous studies that set out to estimate <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> pass-throughs ignored changes in policy regimes, making them vulnerable to the Lucas critique. We find that, within the group of emerging floaters, estimated pass-throughs are higher for countries with greater nominal <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>volatilities</b> and that trade more homogeneous goods. These findings are consistent with the pass-through model of Floden and Wilander (2006) and earlier findings by Campa and Goldberg (2005), respectively. Furthermore, we find that the Indonesian Rupiah, the Thai Baht and possibly the Mexican Peso are commodity currencies, in the sense that their real <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> are cointegrated with international commodity prices. ...|$|R

40|$|Volatility is a {{fascinating}} and important topic for financial markets in general, and probably {{the single most important}} issue in financial risk management. Although volatility itself is not synonymous with risk, it is closely associated with it in the realm of risk management. In this study, I focus on the volatility in the foreign exchange markets and investigate the spillover of volatility from this market to equity correlations and its impact on global equity markets’ bid-ask spreads as a proxy for market quality. I also explore the role that accounting earnings quality play in subsequent volatility in U. S. equity markets. I provide a theoretical base and its associated empirics for the link between <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>volatilities</b> and global equity correlations.
