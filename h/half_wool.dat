50|$|Formerly, a drugget {{was a sort}} {{of cheap}} stuff, very thin and narrow, usually made of wool, or <b>half</b> <b>wool</b> and half silk or linen; it may have been corded but was usually plain. The term is now applied to a coarse fabric having a cotton warp and a wool filling, used for rugs, tablecloths, etc.|$|E
5000|$|The {{construction}} of the Ogres Knitwear factory began in 1965. The decision {{to go forward with}} such a project was made by the United Counsel of Peoples Economy on 30 May 1964, and by the committee of Building and the Architectural committee of the ministry on 20 June 1964.From March 1965 until October 1968, the company bore the name of Ogres Knitwear factory. By the decision of the cabinet of ministers of Latvias SSR from 23 October 1968, and by the order of the ministry of light industry of Latvias SSR from 5 November 1968, Ogres Knitwear factory was renamed as Ogres Knitwear Factory of 50th anniversary of All-Union Leninist Young Communist League.The {{construction of}} the factory lasted five years. The funds spent on the project totalled 40 million rubles( [...] 1 USD - 1 Rub : 1-0,9000). The investment was recovered in 3,5 years. The factory possessed spinning mill and sowing equipment which was made in Italy, as well as knitting equipment from United Kingdom.The completion of the factory was broken down into stages. The first stage of the spinning mill was completed on 28 February 1968, the second stage followed on 30 September 1969. On 30 July 1970, all stages of the project were completed. The main form of activities of the factory were determined to be spinning pure wool and <b>half</b> <b>wool</b> yarn mix, knitting fabrics, and manufacturing of knitted garments.|$|E
60|$|I {{need not}} observe here, that the sheep in Ireland are not near so {{large as the}} sheep in Romney marsh, these last being {{generally}} the largest breed of sheep in England, except a few {{on the bank of}} the river Tees in the bishoprick of Durham. Now if these large sheep yield fleeces of four pounds and a <b>half</b> of <b>wool,</b> we may be supposed to allow the Irish sheep, take them one with another, to yield three pounds of wool to a fleece, or to a sheep, out of which must be deducted the fell wool, most of which is of a shorter growth, and therefore cannot be reckoned so much by at least a pound to a sheep. Begin then to account for the wool, and we may make some calculation from thence of the number of sheep.|$|R

[...] in Cornwall and Devonshire, took {{possession of the}} lands of all priories alien, and of the money, jewels, and valuable effects of the Lombard merchants. He demanded certain quantities of bread, corn, oats, and bacon, from each county; borrowed their silver plate from many abbeys, as well as great sums of money both abroad and at home; and pawned his crown for fifty thousand florins."

50|$|Near the coast, {{the region}} {{receives}} relatively high rainfall and mild temperatures, and its 150 km of coastline {{is a significant}} tourist area. In contrast, the eastern fringe is very arid, and is mainly used for pastoral farming of sheep. Mining of gold, nickel and iron ore also occurs. The remainder of the region is highly suited to agriculture, and {{is the source of}} nearly two thirds of the state's wheat production, <b>half</b> of its <b>wool</b> production, and the majority of its lamb and mutton, oranges, honey, cut flowers and a range of other agricultural and pastoral products.|$|R

"On the 17th of March, 1337, at the {{parliament}} at Westminster, the king created the little prince, then {{seven years of}} age, Duke of Cornwall; and the prince immediately, in exercise of his new dignity, bestowed upon twenty of the most distinguished aspirants the honour of knighthood. Immense supplies were voted by {{the parliament}}s held at Nottingham, Westminster, and Northamton. <b>Half</b> the <b>wool</b> shorn in the summer following was granted to the king, {{with a variety of}} other taxes, customs, and duties. The revenues of all the foreign priories in England, a hundred and ten in number, were appropriated to the crown. Provisions of bacon, wheat, and oats were granted, and the king pawned his own jewels, and even the crown itself, to hire soldiers, and purchase him allies on the Continent. So great did the scarcity of money become in the country that all goods fell to less than half their value. Thus a vast army was raised, and with this King Edward prepared to try his strength with France." ...|$|R
60|$|For {{the rest}} of the night I was only out once, when I succeeded in {{reaching}} the hen-house and brought all my fowls safely to the kitchen, except a hen which would not rise off her young. Between us we had the kitchen floor, a pool of water; and the rain had put out my fires already, as effectually as if it had been an overturned broth-pot. That I never took off my clothes that night I need not say, though of what was happening in the glen I could only guess. A flutter against my window now and again, when the rain had abated, told me of another bird that had flown there to die; and with Waster Lunny, I kept up communication by waving a light, to which he replied in a similar manner. Before morning, however, he ceased to answer my signals, and I feared some catastrophe had occurred at the farm. As it turned out, the family was fighting with the flood for the year's shearing of <b>wool,</b> <b>half</b> of which eventually went down the waters, with the wool-shed on top of it.|$|R
