5|$|The P-3 was powered {{with the}} same DB601A-1 engines. The {{aircraft}} was also <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> off with a land catapult (KL-12). A towing hook {{was added to the}} fuselage under the cockpit for the cable. Just eight examples were produced, all without bomb equipment.|$|E
5|$|An aspect weaver is a metaprogramming utility for aspect-oriented {{languages}} <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> instructions {{specified by}} aspects (isolated representations {{of a significant}} concepts in a program) and generate the final implementation code. The weaver integrates aspects into the locations specified by the software as a pre-compilation step. By merging aspects and classes (representations {{of the structure of}} entities in the program), the weaver generates a woven class.|$|E
5|$|Facing {{a second}} hostage crisis, General Smith {{and other top}} UN commanders began {{shifting}} strategies. The UN began to redeploy its forces to more defensible locations, {{so that they would}} be harder to attack or take hostage. More importantly, Gen. Rose established the UN Rapid Reaction Force, a heavily armed unit with more aggressive rules of engagement, <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> offensive action if necessary to prevent hostage-taking and enforce peace agreements.|$|E
5000|$|Basil Ganglia (voiced by Trevor Devall) - An egocentric, megalomaniacal brain who inhabits a cave on the moon's dark side. He has <b>designs</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> over Hanazuki's moon, {{but must}} rely on others to do his bidding.|$|R
5000|$|The Sadler 29 is {{a popular}} British sailing yacht {{designed}} by David Sadler. Over 400 Sadler 29s were produced. [...] In April 1988 the Sadler 29 was the oldest <b>design</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> part in Yachting World’s Mini Rally.|$|R
25|$|It was {{powered by}} two 525hp (392kW) Bristol Jupiter XI engines, mounted {{on top of}} each lower wing.

5|$|The {{first phase}} saw the {{addition}} of an inner railway track, which was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{a third of the}} weight of the telescope. The outer railway track, which had been decaying and sinking over the previous years, was relaid in the second phase. Four bogies and their steelwork were added on the inner track, and the existing bogies on the outer track were overhauled.|$|E
5|$|Facing {{a second}} hostage crisis, General Smith {{and other top}} UN commanders began to shift strategy. The UN began redeploying its forces to more {{defensible}} locations, {{so that they would}} be harder to attack and so that it would be more difficult to take UN personnel hostage. General Michael Rose established the UN Rapid Reaction Force, a heavily armed land unit with more aggressive rules of engagement, <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> offensive action if necessary to prevent hostage-taking and enforce peace agreements.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1930s, {{aviation}} design teams worldwide started {{developing a}} new generation of all-metal, low-wing fighter aircraft. The French Dewoitine D.520 and Germany's Messerschmitt Bf 109, for example, were <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> advantage of new techniques of monocoque construction and the availability of new high-powered, liquid-cooled, in-line aero engines. They also featured refinements such as retractable undercarriages, fully enclosed cockpits, low drag and all-metal wings (all introduced on civil airliners years before but slow to be adopted by the military, who favoured the biplane's simplicity and manoeuvrability).|$|E
6000|$|... 'Would it {{be generous}} and honourable {{to step into}} your place--if you did so, for I don't know that you did, and I hope you did not--anticipating, or knowing beforehand, that I should come here, and <b>designing</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> me at this disadvantage?' ...|$|R

5000|$|A {{number of}} {{improvements}} were introduced; {{to the front}} and rear aerodynamics, exterior styling, greater torsional rigidity for the chassis, reduced weight, and enhanced front suspension geometry. The cockpit was updated to give more interior space. GKD produce their own fabricated suspension uprights instead of compromising the <b>design</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> donor uprights.|$|R
5|$|Another {{proposed}} spacecraft, the Gemini Lunar Surface Survival Shelter, {{was designed}} to be sent to the Moon ahead of an Apollo mission. It would have landed close to the planned Apollo landing site, and if the Apollo Lunar Module's ascent stage failed to ignite, the crew would have performed an EVA to transfer to the LSSS. The shelter was not <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> off again after landing, so an LSRS or another Apollo mission would then be sent to collect the crew, whilst the Command Module Pilot of the original Apollo mission would have returned to Earth alone aboard his spacecraft. It consisted of a Gemini Reentry Module, which would have housed the astronauts whilst they awaited rescue, and a descent stage containing life support systems, consumables, and the engine and propellant used to land the spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|Jagielski {{signed up}} to the Polish Workers' Party (PPR) in 1944, or in 1946 (sources vary). When the Polish Worker's Party {{transformed}} into the Polish United Workers Party (PZPR) in 1948, he {{became a member of}} the new party. From 1946 to 1949, Jagielski served on the Central Board of the Związek Samopomocy Chłopskiej (Association of Peasant Self-Help), a communist organization <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> control of the countryside. From 1950 to 1952 he was on the Central Board of the State Agricultural Farms and from December 1952 to December 1953 he was a deputy director of that institution. In December 1953, he became the Director of the Agricultural Department of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers Party, a position he would hold until December 1956.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{designed}} to appeal to players of varying skill levels. To assist less skilled players, bonus coins and 1-ups are more abundant in earlier worlds, while later worlds present more complex challenges for more experienced players. In the two-player mode, the players alternate turns to balance play time. The development team introduced new power-ups and concepts that would give Mario the appearance of different creatures {{as a means of}} providing him with new abilities. An early idea changed Mario into a centaur but was dropped in favor of a raccoon tail that allows limited flying ability. Other costumes with different abilities were added to his repertoire, and levels were <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> advantage of these abilities. New enemies were included to add diversity to the game, along with variants of previous enemies, such as Goombas, Hammer Bros., and Koopa Troopas.|$|E
30|$|In {{the survey}} data, the {{probability}} that individuals will be sampled is assumed dependent on the survey <b>design.</b> <b>To</b> <b>take</b> into account this feature, students’ educational production functions were estimated using survey regression methods. This allowed us to include student weights and school clusters depending on the sampling probabilities and within standard errors respectively in our analysis.|$|R

30|$|This {{study used}} a {{qualitative}} methodology of {{focus groups and}} in-depth interviews. Students and employers {{are considered to be}} two groups with first-hand experience who can play an advisory role and give critical comment on the applicability of current education to the industry. It is therefore necessary for the research <b>design</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> into account not just the perceptions of educators, but also those of students and employers. This triangulation is richly informative because it provides three different perspectives on the same issue.|$|R
