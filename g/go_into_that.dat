5|$|The ACLU {{continues}} to defend individuals who feel abused or improperly {{treated by the}} government. Often the American Civil Liberties Union is the group {{to stand up for}} an individual when being discriminated against because of their religion, sex, gender, sexuality, race, or class, even when they are not the popular opinion. The Reproductive Freedom Project, however, goes deeper than the ACLU. The Project promotes sexual and reproductive health by providing lessons about contraception, knowing about one's reproductive rights and assisting with the financial burdens of abortions and all of the logistics that may <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E
5|$|I {{asked him}} not to <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> field, {{that you were going}} there. He laughed at the idea of being {{restricted}} to any locality and said he intended to go whether I aided him or not. I was anxious to secure the cooperation of such a worker as an honor to my corps. I could not be responsible for the field he selected in as much as I pay him no salary and a portion of his expenses. You will see therefore that while it is not a pleasant thing to work in competition with others it seems almost a necessity. You can sympathize.|$|E

500|$|Film {{director}} Tim Burton—who {{had directed}} the 1989 Batman film—felt Nolan [...] "captured the real spirit that {{these kind of}} movies {{are supposed to have}} nowadays. When I did Batman twenty years ago, in 1988 or something, it was a different time in comic book movies. You couldn't <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> dark side of comics yet. The last couple of years that has become acceptable and Nolan certainly got more to the root of what the Batman comics are about." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the first}} female {{presenter}} of Grandstand, Helen Rollason was a pioneer of British sports broadcasting, an industry that was predominantly male at the time, and she established a precedent that allowed others to follow. Sue Barker, Hazel Irvine, Gail McKenna, Shelley Webb and Gabby Yorath all followed in Rollason's footsteps to become noted UK sports presenters, with Yorath joining ITV as their first female sports presenter in the late 1990s, where she co-hosted the football show On the Ball and was a contributor to The Premiership. Yorath paid tribute to Rollason shortly after her death, saying she would be [...] "an icon for young girls who want to <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> field because she showed what could be done. She was a great example to everyone." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] {{made its}} concert debut on 2 April 1987 in Tempe, Arizona {{on the opening}} night of The Joshua Tree Tour. A version {{featuring}} an extended introduction {{was performed on the}} closing nights of the third leg of The Joshua Tree tour, again in Tempe, Arizona, on December 19 & 20, 1987, and footage from the performance was featured in the Rattle and Hum film. [...] The song has since been played at nearly every full-length concert that U2 has headlined, totaling upwards of 900 performances [...] The song is widely {{regarded as one of the}} group's most popular live songs. Bono said of it, [...] "We can be in the middle of the worst gig in our lives, but when we <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> song, everything changes. The audience is on its feet, singing along with every word. It's like God suddenly walks through the room." ...|$|E

500|$|The song [...] "All Hands on the Bad One" [...] {{features}} guitar riffs {{that are}} reminiscent of the band's second album, Call the Doctor. It {{was chosen as the}} title track because, according to guitarist Carrie Brownstein, it is the song that best represents the sentiment of the album. Brownstein explained that the song deals with [...] "your relationship to evil and your relationship to the hypocrisy of forcing a morality on someone else when you yourself are no better." [...] She added, [...] "'Ballad of the Ladyman', for instance—who is 'the ladyman'? Is the person that wants to be on the radio, 'the bad one,' or is it the fans assuming that they [...] {{want to be on the}} radio—are they 'the bad one'? Or is 'The Professional,' the ominous professional figure, 'the bad one'? I think all these songs can <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> machine of 'the bad one' and that mentality and then be spit out in a bunch of different scenarios. So that's why I think it works as the title." ...|$|E
2500|$|With {{respect to}} the design of Baymax, Hall {{mentioned}} in an interview, [...] "I wanted a robot that we had never seen before and something to be wholly original. That's a tough thing to do, we've got a lot of robots in pop culture, everything from The Terminator to WALL-E to C-3PO on down the line and not to mention Japanese robots, I won't <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>that.</b> So I wanted to do something original." [...] Even if they did not yet know what the robot should look like, artist Lisa Keene {{came up with the idea}} that it should be a huggable robot.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} for the New York Times magazine, Danger Mouse was compared to a film auteur, basing his music production philosophy on the cinematic philosophy of directors like Woody Allen. [...] "Woody Allen was an auteur: he did his thing, and that particular thing was completely his own," [...] he said. [...] "That's what I decided to do with music. I {{want to create a}} director's role within music, which is what I tried to do on this album (St. Elsewhere)... I can create different kinds of musical worlds, but the artist needs the desire to <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> world... Musically, there is no one who has the career I want. That's why I have to use film directors as a model." ...|$|E

2500|$|Who is {{homosexual}}? My {{answer is}} that a homosexual is somebody who is abnormal because the normal person was created to be attracted to the opposite sex ... to procreate and perpetuate the human race. ... y bishop of North Ankole, Rt. Rev. Muhanguzi ... asked the following question: ... How can God contradict himself by saying in the Book of Genesis that Adam {{should be given a}} wife, Eve, and then also create homosexuals? ... However, now that I have been forced to concentrate my mind on this issue by the actions {{of a small group of}} our MPs led by the Rt. Hon. Kadaga, I can see the fallacy of Bishop Muhanguzi's position. ... Do Albinos create themselves? No. Simply, nature goes wrong in a minority of cases. ... The question at the core of the debate of the homosexuals is: [...] "What do we do with an abnormal person? Do we kill him/her? Do we imprison him/her? Or do we contain him/her?" ... Apart from the people who are born abnormal, it seems there is a larger group of those that become homosexual for mercenary reasons - they get recruited on account of financial inducements. ... How about the women lesbians? Apart from the ones who are born abnormal and the ones that may become lesbian for mercenary reasons, there may be those that <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> practice because of sexual starvation when they fail to get married. Women are normally more [...] than men.... In the past, this imbalance could have been addressed by polygamy. ... The groups that can be rescued ... are those who are homosexual or lesbian for mercenary reasons or on account of ... failure to get legal partners. The rescue for these mercenary deviants is, first and foremost, economic - rapidly industrialize Uganda, modernize agriculture, etc. ... In addition ... we should legislate harshly against those people with money, from within and without, who take advantange of the desperation of our youth to lure them into these abnormal and deviant behaviors. I would support a life sentence.... On this one I would agree with the Bill passed by Parliament. The unanswered question, however, is: What do you do with the really abnormal people? ... Only the other day, I saw on television that Dr. Allan Turing, the genius mathematician that cracked the German Enigma code for the anti-Hitler alliance ... was a homosexual. This man ... enabled them to win the war. Yet, the British chemically castrated him in 1952, where-upon he committed suicide, apparently. Were the British correct in handling that issue like that? The British no longer think so. Only the other day, the Queen had to apologize to this ... person ... much more useful to society than the millions of sexually normal people. ... he challenge is how to correctly handle the sexually abnormal on the one hand and those who use money or any other influence to recruit sexually normal people into this abnormal and disgusting behaviour. When we meet in the NRM caucus, we shall, I am sure, find a scientifically correct position.|$|E
