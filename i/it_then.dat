5|$|Early on August11, {{the storm}} {{weakened}} slightly while crossing Florida. <b>It</b> <b>then</b> decelerated {{and reached the}} eastern Gulf of Mexico several hours later. Thereafter, the system began to re-strengthen and became a Category1 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale at 1200UTC on August12. Early the next day, the storm attained its maximum sustained wind speed of 90mph (150km/h). It weakened slightly early on August14 and curved northwestward while approaching the coast of Louisiana. At 2100UTC, the storm made landfall near Buras with winds of 85mph (140km/h). Curving northeastward, the hurricane re-emerged into the Gulf of Mexico early on August15. However, around 1700UTC, it made another landfall near Ocean Springs, Mississippi at the same intensity. Early on August16, the system weakened to a tropical storm. <b>It</b> <b>then</b> weakened much quicker and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over Mississippi at 0000UTC on August17.
