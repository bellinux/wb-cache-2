25|$|In other {{reactors}} {{the coolant}} {{acts as a}} poison by absorbing neutrons {{in the same way}} that the control rods do. In these reactors power output can be increased by heating the coolant, which makes it a less dense poison. Nuclear reactors generally have automatic and manual systems to scram the reactor in an <b>emergency</b> <b>shut</b> <b>down.</b> These systems insert large amounts of poison (often boron in the form of boric acid) into the reactor to shut the fission reaction down if unsafe conditions are detected or anticipated.|$|E
25|$|Boric acid {{is used in}} some {{nuclear power}} plants as a neutron poison. The boron in boric acid reduces the {{probability}} of thermal fission by absorbing some thermal neutrons. Fission chain reactions are generally driven by the probability that free neutrons will result in fission and {{is determined by the}} material and geometric properties of the reactor. Natural boron consists of approximately 20% boron-10 and 80% boron-11 isotopes. Boron-10 has a high cross-section for absorption of low energy (thermal) neutrons. By increasing boric acid concentration in the reactor coolant, the probability that a neutron will cause fission is reduced. Changes in boric acid concentration can effectively regulate the rate of fission taking place in the reactor. Boric acid is used only in pressurized water reactors (PWRs) whereas boiling water reactors (BWRs) employ control rod pattern and coolant flow for power control. BWRs use an aqueous solution of boric acid and borax or Sodium Pentaborate for an <b>emergency</b> <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> system. Boric acid may be dissolved in spent fuel pools used to store spent fuel elements. The concentration is high enough to keep neutron multiplication at a minimum. Boric acid was dumped over Reactor 4 of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant after its meltdown to prevent another reaction from occurring.|$|E

50|$|Alarms {{were added}} to alert the {{operator}} to a condition {{that was about to}} exceed a design limit, or had already exceeded a design limit. Additionally, <b>Emergency</b> <b>Shut</b> <b>Down</b> (ESD) systems were employed to halt a process that was in danger of exceeding either safety, environmental or monetarily acceptable process limits. Alarm were indicated to the operator by annunciator horns, and lights of different colours. (For instance, green lights meant OK, Yellow meant not OK, and Red meant BAD.) Panel boards were usually laid out in a manner that replicated the process flow in the plant. So instrumentation indicating operating units with the plant was grouped together for recognition sake and ease of problem solution. It was a simple matter to look at the entire panel board, and discern whether any section of the plant was running poorly. This was due to both the design of the instruments and the implementation of the alarms associated with the instruments. Instrumentation companies put a lot of effort into the design and individual layout of the instruments they manufactured. To do this they employed behavioural psychology practices which revealed how much information a human being could collect in a quick glance. More complex plants had more complex panel boards, and therefore often more human operators or controllers.|$|E

The main control purpose is to generate a power curve that is close to the ideal power curve where the energy efficiency is maximized below the nominal wind speed of 11 m/s and the power is limited to the nominal value above the nominal wind speed. Turbsim is integrated with both environments to generate a realistic wind profile of Kaimal turbulence model.

40|$|Due to the {{criticality}} {{of continuous}} mission operations, some control centers must plan for alternate {{locations in the}} event an <b>emergency</b> <b>shuts</b> <b>down</b> the primary control center. Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Texas is the Mission Control Center (MCC) for the International Space Station (ISS). Due to Houston s proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, JSC is prone to threats from hurricanes which could cause flooding, wind damage, and electrical outages to the buildings supporting the MCC. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) has the capability to be the Backup Control Center for the ISS if the situation is needed. While the MSFC Huntsville Operations Support Center (HOSC) does house the BCC, the prime customer and operator of the ISS is still the JSC flight operations team. To satisfy the customer and maintain continuous mission operations, the BCC has critical infrastructure that hosts ISS ground systems and flight operations equipment that mirrors the prime mission control facility. However, a complete duplicate of Mission Control Center in another remote location is very expensive to recreate. The HOSC has infrastructure and services that MCC utilized for its backup control center to reduce the costs of a somewhat redundant service. While labor talents are equivalent, experiences are not. Certain operations are maintained in a redundant mode, while others are simply maintained as single string with adequate sparing levels of equipment. Personnel at the BCC facility must be trained and certified to an adequate level on primary MCC systems. Negotiations with the customer were done to match requirements with existing capabilities, and to prioritize resources for appropriate level of service. Because some of these systems are shared, an activation of the backup control center will cause a suspension of scheduled HOSC activities that may share resources needed by the BCC. For example, the MCC is monitoring a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico. As the threat to MCC increases, HOSC must begin a phased activation of the BCC, while working resource conflicts with normal HOSC activities. In a long duration outage to the MCC, this could cause serious impacts to the BCC host facility s primary mission support activities. This management of a BCC is worked based on customer expectations and negotiations done before emergencies occur. I...|$|R

This prototype wind turbine has a nominal power of 500 KW at a nominal wind speed of around 11 m/s. Aerodynamic, mechanical, electrical and control models are built in S 4 WT (Samcef for Wind Turbines) environment. Kaimal turbulence model have been used to generate realistic wind profiles in Turbsim that can be integrated with S 4 WT. The standard components (tower, bedplate, rotor, rotor shaft, gearbox, generator and coupling shaft) consisting of Samcef elements (bush, hinge, beam) have been used compatible with the IEC 61400 - 1 in S 4 WT to perform the simulations. The pitch and torque controllers are used to achieve the ideal power curve. A pitch function and a PI controller with gain scheduling have been used to control the pitch angle of the blades to limit the power at the full load operating region.
