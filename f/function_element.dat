The aim is {{to shed light on}} the variation in mobility resources of those who perceive they can use public transport as their primary mode of transport and of those who perceive they cannot ('mobility capability element), {{as well as that of}} those using public transport and of those not using it ('mobility <b>functioning</b> <b>element).</b> Increasing residential density, being female and having a higher functional capacity were among the mobility resources which produced a positive increase in the likelihood of considering it possible to use, and the use of, public transport. The higher the ratio of cars to household member, the lower the likelihood of including public transport as a mobility capability element or as a mobility <b>functioning</b> <b>element.</b> Most of those who included public transport use as both a mobility capability element and a mobility <b>functioning</b> <b>element</b> were also users of the private car. There was also a tendency towards car use rather than towards no travel if the individual was not a user of public transport. Through the application of the Capability Approach, this paper facilitates further insight into the variation in mobility resources, corresponding mobility capability and mobility <b>functioning</b> <b>elements</b> of this group, with respect to public transport.
