5000|$|The {{following}} will explain in full detail {{the steps to}} calculate NNI according to Eck, Chainey, Cameron, and Wilson (2005). First, crime incidents are geocoded on a map, and then the distance between one crime incident and its neighbor is calculated. Following that all the distances are added up and divided {{by the amount of}} crime incidents on the map. According to Eck, Chainey, Cameron, and Wilson, (2005) this value is called the observed average nearest neighbor distance. Then a map of random incidents needs to be made covering the same area being analyzed. The same process of calculations needs to be made to make the average random nearest neighbor distance. These two numbers then create a ratio that compares the observed incidents to the random incidents that is called the nearest neighbor index. [...] Eck, Chainey, Cameron, and Wilson (2005) further explain that if the results generated are less than 1.0 the crime <b>incident</b> <b>data</b> are considered clustered. If the results are equal to 1.0, the crime <b>incident</b> <b>data</b> are randomly distributed on the map. Finally a nearest neighbor index that is greater than 1.0, the data set shows a significant uniform crime pattern in then data set. Using the nearest neighbor index tests for complete randomness in a set of data points. This is useful for analysts because it is a technique that can measure changes of density over periods of time (Ratcliffe, 2004).|$|E

50|$|Every cell grid in the map is {{assigned}} a value. This {{results in a}} continues map, a map of a city {{under the jurisdiction of}} a given police department for example. This map portraits the crime <b>incidents</b> <b>data</b> or intensity in the form of shades of colors for each grid throughout the area of study. Every part of the map has cells thus every part of the map has intensity value. Therefore, after conducting the kernel density analysis, it can be determine if grid cells with high crime intensity values are clustered together and thus forming a crime hotspot. The cells that possess higher intensity values within the crime hotspots only show the crime density but cannot be further analyze in order to locate the spatial coverage of crime concentrations. The ability to manipulate cell and bandwidth sizes permits analyst to use kernel density for conducting analysis at a small scope level within a crime hotspot.|$|R
40|$|Objectives; The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to review the published evidence concerning the efficacy and potential for adverse reactions of modern dentifrices toothpastes. Data sources; Publications cited on MEDLINE since 1990. Some further pre- 1990 publications are also referenced. Data selection; Studies concerning the efficacy of dentifrices and their components and any related putative adverse <b>incidents.</b> <b>Data</b> extraction; Papers were scrutinised for scientific and trial data. Data synthesis; Data concerning the efficacy of dentifrice components were summarised. Conclusions; The efficacy of fluoride salts in dentifrices in reducing dental caries is well established. Toothpastes, containing triclosan, are effective in improving plaque control, gingivitis and periodontal health. Other toothpaste formulations are effective in reducing the formation of calculus, extrinsic tooth stain, dentine sensitivity and oral malodour. The consumer now has available a range of toothpastes which deliver oral health benefits. Adverse reactions to toothpastes are rare but should be considered in unexplained skin or respiratory allergies and gingival or lip lesions...|$|R
40|$|Popular opinion {{has it that}} “road rage ” is {{increasingly}} prevalent in urban areas.

Researchers evaluated the benefits of freeway bottleneck improvements. Feedback from commuters revealed that a majority realized reduced aggressive behaviors and commute time after improvements at a bottleneck. Almost 50 percent indicated an improvement in their stress level. Operational data collected at the bottleneck site (increased volumes, speeds, and decreased queue lengths) supported the feedback from commuter surveys.

50|$|<b>Incident</b> <b>data</b> {{shows that}} the {{greatest}} potential for a wake vortex incident occurs when a light aircraft is turning from base to final behind a heavy aircraft flying a straight-in approach. Light aircraft pilots must use extreme caution and intercept their final approach path above or well behind the heavier aircraft's path. When a visual approach following a preceding aircraft is issued and accepted, the pilot is required to establish a safe landing interval behind the aircraft he was instructed to follow. The pilot is responsible for wake turbulence separation. Pilots must not decrease the separation that existed when the visual approach was issued unless they can remain on or above the flight path of the preceding aircraft. Having a higher approach path and touching down further along the runway than the previous aircraft will help avoid wake turbulence.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess attitudes toward and use of an {{electronic}} adverse incident reporting system in all four hospitals in one NHS Scotland Health Board area. A questionnaire was used to assess Medical Consultants', Managers', and Nurses' attitudes and perceptions about electronic adverse incident reporting. Actual adverse <b>incident</b> reporting <b>data</b> were also analysed. The main findings from this study are that Consultants, Managers, and Nurses all had positive attitudes about responsibility for reporting adverse incidents. All respondents indicated that the design of and information collected by the electronic adverse incident reporting system (DATIX) was adequate but Consultants had more negative attitudes and perceptions than Managers and Nurses about DATIX. All respondents expressed negative attitudes about the amount and type of feedback they receive from reporting, and Consultants expressed more negative attitudes about how DATIX is managed than Managers and Nurses. Analysis of adverse <b>incident</b> reporting <b>data</b> found that the proportion of Consultants using DATIX to report incidents was significantly lower than that of Managers and Nurses. The findings suggest that there are no additional barriers to incident reporting associated with the use of a bespoke electronic adverse incident reporting system as compared to other types of systems. Although an electronic adverse incident reporting system may be able to increase incident reporting and facilitate organisational learning by making it easier to report incidents and analyse <b>incident</b> reporting <b>data,</b> strong leadership within hospitals / healthcare professions (or healthcare subcultures) is still required in order to promote and sustain incident reporting to improve patient safety...|$|R
