Speaking to Hindustan Times, Khan said: “I’ve always been involved with gay rights. The scenario in this country is disheartening and depressing. These are basic human rights that people are being denied of; they’re no minority. The idea of this initiative <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> those who do not support homosexuality, how ridiculous their thinking is.” Other Bollywood stars have spoken out to condemn the reintroduction of the law.|$|E

His intent <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> a friend, Brigadier General Wheeler (Delroy Lindo), the commandant's {{superior}} officer, that the commandant is unfit and should be removed from command under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. During a visit, Winter receives a letter threatening the kidnapping of General Wheeler by the prisoners. After ordering his men into action, Winter discovers that the scheme was a fake orchestrated by Irwin to detect how prison guards would react during an actual uprising.|$|E

50|$|In early model theory, {{quantifier}} elimination <b>was</b> used <b>to</b> {{demonstrate that}} various theories possess properties like decidability and completeness. A common technique <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> first that a theory admits elimination of quantifiers and thereafter prove decidability or completeness {{by considering only}} the quantifier-free formulas. This technique can <b>be</b> used <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that Presburger arithmetic is decidable.|$|R

25|$|Badiou makes {{repeated}} use {{of several}} concepts throughout his philosophy. One of {{the aims of}} his thought <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that his categories of truth are useful for any type of philosophical critique.

Johannes Thumfart argues that Badiou's philosophy {{can be regarded as}} a contemporary reinterpretation of Platonism.|$|E
25|$|The {{easiest way}} to see this is {{isomorphic}} to βN <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that it satisfies the universal property. For f: N → K with K compact Hausdorff and F an ultrafilter on N we have an ultrafilter f(F) on K, the pushforward of F. This has a unique limit, say x, because K is compact Hausdorff, and we define βf(F) = x. This may readily be verified to be a continuous extension.|$|E

The second aim <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> how linguistics can be used to address key ecological issues, from climate change and biodiversity loss to environmental justice.|$|E
