40|$|This study {{assessed}} the preparedness of fire emergency among public universities in Tanzania {{a case of}} the Open University of Tanzania and University of Dar es Salaam as a result of fire occurrences in different public institutions. The main focus was to assess the community awareness on <b>fire</b> <b>outbreaks</b> and safety responses, examine the programmes for fighting against fire outbreaks; examine availability and functioning of fire fighting gears at the study areas. The study adopted a phenomenological qualitative research design which focused on cross-sectional descriptive approach. Both purposive and random sampling techniques were applied whereby 76 respondents were selected from the facility users. Questionnaires, interviews, FGDs and personal observation were used for the collection of data. Data collected were quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed using SPSS and QDA Miner 4 Lite software respectively. It was finally revealed from the study that fire emergency preparedness was low among the selected universities. This comes as a result of inadequacy of training for facility users, community unawareness on the uses of fire fighting gears, lack of enlightenment for creating community awareness and cautions on fire incidences and poor <b>fire</b> <b>outbreaks</b> management. The study recommended the improvement of integrative fire management preparedness strategies, Public Fire Disaster Awareness (PFDA); the reviews of the laws governing fire fighting and safety and policy formulation to be put into consideration to fight against <b>fire</b> <b>outbreaks...</b>|$|R

The analyses are based on the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), which is a well-established and important statistical analysis technique in the fields of biology, psychology and medicine, but hitherto rarely applied in safety research. The results of the study demonstrate that for the analyzed random sample of industrial buildings the frequency of <b>fire</b> <b>outbreaks</b> statistically significantly depends only on the presence and the probability of exposition to the heat sources (flames, sparks, and hot surfaces), but does not significantly depend on the available quantity of flammable materials within the industrial structure...|$|R

30|$|In recent <b>fire</b> <b>outbreaks</b> in Ghana, an {{analysis}} of disaster impacts in informal settlements shows that fire causes the greatest loss of life and property in Ghana (Sarpong 2013). Responding to fires, especially in informal settlements, {{continues to be a}} daunting task for the vulnerable population because of low capacities developed to prevent fire risks. A summary of natural disaster occurrences indicates that 10 natural disasters occurred from the year 1900 to 2014 (EM-DAT 2014). According to the United Nations Development Programme-UNDP (2013) report, in Ghana, disasters such as fire, pest and flood epidemics occur most often. However, there are limited capacities within government authorities and among communities to cope effectively with these disaster risks. Disaster risk has, therefore, become a commercial issue. Statistically, the forestry sector reveals that the annual loss of revenue from merchantable timber to wildfire is about US$ 24 million and the cumulative effect of wildfires, an annual loss of 3  % of Ghana’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (SDAP 2010). The country loses {{a lot of money and}} resources due to numerous <b>fire</b> <b>outbreaks,</b> which include losses from domestic, industrial, institutional, vehicular, commercial, electrical fires and bushfires.|$|R

These extinguishers, fitted with a new style of head, enabled them to be operated by simply withdrawing a pin and squeezing a lever-no matter which type of extinguisher in the Chubb range was being used. Previously, different operating methods were needed for different fire fighting media and the new concept ensured that training, especially where multi-purpose risks were involved, became extremely simplified, reducing the possible confusion at a critical time when immediate action is necessary to control a <b>fire</b> <b>outbreak.</b> Operating instructions were made clearer for instant response and colour codes ensured immediate identification of the right type of extinguisher for the appropriate risk.

5000|$|Born in 1900 in {{the village}} of Tayba Ñaseen (spelled Taïba Niassène in French), between the Senegalese city of Kaolack and the border of Gambia, {{he was the son of}} Allaaji Abdulaay Ñas (1840-1922), the main {{representative}} of the Tijānī Sufi Order, often referred to asTareeqat al-Tijjaniyyaa, in the Saalum region at the beginning of the twentieth century. During his youth, Sheykh Ibrahim relocated with his father to the city of Kaolack, where they established the zāwiya (religious center) of Lewna Ñaseen. After his father's death in Lewna Ñaseen in 1922, Shaykh Ibrāhīm's elder brother, Muhammad al-Khalīfa, became his father's successor or Khalīfa. The 22-year-old Shaykh Ibrāhīm spent most of his time farming in the family's fields and teaching a growing number of disciples in the nearby village of Kóosi Mbittéyeen. Although Shaykh Ibrāhīm never claimed to be his father's successor, due to his charisma and precocious knowledge, he gained a large number of disciples, and tensions arose between his disciples and those of his elder brother, Muhammad al-Khalifa. In 1929, while on the farm in Kóosi Mbittéyeen, the youthful Shaykh Ibrāhīm announced that he had been given the Key to Secrets of Divine Knowledge, and thus became the Khalifa of Sheykh Tijani in the Tijaniyya Order, a position yet to be attained by anyone as of that time. Sheikh Ibrahim then declared that whoever wishes to attain ma'arifa, a level of Divine Certainty in the Sufi Order, must follow him. In 1930, after the prayer of ʿĪd al-Fiṭr (the end of the month of Ramadān), a fight broke out between Shaykh Ibrahim's disciples and those of Muhammad al-Khalīfa The incident made Shaykh Ibrahim immediately decide to relocate with his disciples to a new place. That evening, he set out with a small group of his closest disciples to find a new place to live, and the next day they established a new zāwiya in Medina Baay, a village that was later incorporated into the growing city of Kaolack. In the following years, the shaykh divided his time between teaching during the dry season in Madina Baay and farming during the rainy season in Kóosi Mbittéyeen. During the summer of 1945 he reestablished himself in his father's house in his natal village of Tayba Ñaseen, rebuilding and reorganizing the village after a <b>fire</b> <b>outbreak</b> had destroyed much of it.|$|E

This study assesses whether the traders are aware of fire insurance and have taken such policies to cover their goods and stalls. A sample of 95 traders was used and it was found out that majority (50. 52 %) of the traders did not understand the concept of insurance so they had wrong perception about it; the traders were aware of the causes of <b>fire</b> <b>outbreak</b> and ranked electricity power fluctuations as the major cause; the traders could use water and sand to quench fire but only a few of them could use foam, carbon dioxide and dry powder to control <b>fire</b> <b>outbreak.</b> Relevant recommendations have been made for these traders and policy makers to strategize in order to have better protection on the market...|$|E
