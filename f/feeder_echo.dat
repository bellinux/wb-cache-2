50|$|Post Britpop bands {{have been}} seen as {{presenting}} the image of the rock star as an ordinary person and their increasingly melodic music was criticised for being bland or derivative. Post Britpop bands like the Verve with Urban Hymns (1997), Radiohead from OK Computer (1997), Travis from The Man Who (1999), Stereophonics from Performance and Cocktails (1999), <b>Feeder</b> from <b>Echo</b> Park (2001) and particularly Coldplay from their debut album Parachutes (2000), achieved much wider international success than most of the Britpop groups that had preceded them, and were some of the most commercially successful acts of the late 1990s and early 2000s, arguably providing a launchpad for the subsequent garage rock or post-punk revival, which has also been seen as a reaction to their introspective brand of rock.|$|R
