25|$|Von Kluck sent von der Marwitz's II Cavalry Corps (3 cavalry divisions) {{around the}} British west flank {{to prevent a}} British retreat on the Channel ports. Sir John French sent a message (24 August), with an unmistakable tone of pique, to Lanrezac, which Spears insisted on writing down, warning that the BEF might have to retreat {{southwest}} towards Amiens on its lines of communication, although it is unclear that this would actually have been practicable if the Germans had actually been moving in force around the British left flank. However, Sir John agreed to Joffre's request that the BEF, now numbering 5 divisions {{as it had been}} joined by the 4th Infantry Division, would instead fall back on Cambrai if it had to, so that the BEF could still protect the French left flank. Joffre also sent a further two French reserve divisions to the British left flank, the beginning of the redeployment of French forces which would see Maunoury's Sixth Army form around Amiens and then fight near Paris. French considered, but rejected, the option of sheltering the BEF in the fortified town of Maubeuge, partly out of instinct that the Germans were hoping to tempt him into allowing himself to be besieged there and partly because <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> Edward Hamley had likened Bazaine allowing himself to be besieged in Metz in 1870 to a shipwrecked man taking hold of the anchor. French himself issued no direct written orders between 11.15pm on 21 August and 8.25pm on 24 August; Terraine argued that this, along with his absence during the battle of Mons (although on the German side von Kluck also played little direct role in the battle), marks the point when he and GHQ began to disengage from active command of the BEF, leaving Smith-Dorrien and Haig in effective control of their corps.|$|E

His roommate on the trip was future Carnegie Mellon University computer science professor John Stamper. As Brin recalls, the trip awakened his childhood fear of authority and <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> [...] "his first impulse on confronting Soviet oppression had been to throw pebbles at a police car".

It was changed to Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, as Spielberg found it more inviting a title and actually named the plot device of the crystal skulls. Lucas insisted on the Kingdom part.

The episode features cultural references to songs such as [...] "Monster Mash" [...] and [...] "Break On Through", as well as a reference to the fictional character Droopy. Since airing, [...] "I Love Lisa" [...] has received mostly positive reviews from television critics; Entertainment Weekly placed the episode twelfth on their top 25 The Simpsons episodes list. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 14.9 and was the highest rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.

500|$|Following the episode's release, ScreenRant's Andre Dyce {{reviewed}} the series' ratings performance {{up to that}} point, noting that over 7 million viewers is [...] "still {{a far cry from}} trouble on their own", but as the show [...] "continues to slip in both viewers and demographics, the trend could become problematic." [...] He noted that the drop in viewers from the series premiere, which had [...] "some of the highest ratings in recent history" [...] for ABC, to the second episode was to be expected, but [...] "the fact that [...] can’t seem to hold steady in its fifth week is a sign that it may be charting troubled waters ... A rocky start is to be expected, but by this point in the season, most procedural dramas tend to have hit their pace both in structure and audience."

500|$|Hoffman {{was baptized}} a Roman Catholic and {{attended}} mass as a child, {{but did not}} have a heavily religious upbringing. His parents divorced when he was nine, leaving the children to be raised primarily by their mother. Hoffman's childhood passion was sports, particularly wrestling and baseball, but at age 12, he saw a stage production of Arthur Miller's All My Sons and was transfixed. He recalled in 2008, [...] "I was changed– permanently changed– by that experience. It was like a miracle to me". Hoffman developed a love for the theater, and proceeded to attend regularly with his mother, who was a lifelong enthusiast. <b>He</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> productions of Quilters and Alms for the Middle Class, the latter starring a teenaged Robert Downey, Jr., were also particularly inspirational. At the age of 14, Hoffman suffered a neck injury that ended his sporting activity, and he began to consider acting. Encouraged by his mother, he joined a drama club, and initially committed to it because he was attracted to a female member.|$|E
500|$|The Phantom Tollbooth {{contains}} {{allusions to}} many works, including those loved by Juster {{in his own}} upbringing. Some of Juster's favorite books as a child, including The Wind in the Willows, had endpaper maps; Juster insisted on one, over Feiffer's opposition, {{going so far as}} to sketch one and require that his collaborator reproduce it in his own style. Juster was also inspired by his father Samuel's love of puns, with which the book is more than sprinkled. In his childhood, Juster spent much time listening to the radio. According to Juster, the need to envision the action when listening to radio serials helped inspire The Phantom Tollbooth, as well as yielding the character of Tock, based on sidekick Jim Fairfield from Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy. Jim gave Tock his wisdom, courage, and adventurous spirit. As a child, Juster had synesthesia, and could only do arithmetic by making associations between numbers and colors. <b>He</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> the condition affected word associations. [...] "One of the things I always did was think literally when I heard words. On the Lone Ranger [...] they would say, 'Here come the Injuns!' and I always had an image of engines, of train engines." ...|$|E
500|$|In his memoir, Eminent Hipsters, Fagen {{notes that}} the cover figure [...] "wasn't {{supposed}} to be a stand-in for any particular jazz DJ," [...] but noted a few personalities from the period that factored into the creation: Ed Beach, Dan Morgenstern, Martin Williams, R.D. Harlan, [...] "Symphony Sid" [...] Torin, and what Fagen regarded as his [...] "main man", WEVD's Mort Fega. [...] "He was laid-back, knowledgeable, and forthright, the cool uncle you wished you'd had." [...] At the time of the album's release, <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> jazz music offered him an escape from the adults in his life: [...] "When I saw E.T.,' I realized that the E.T. in my bedroom was my Thelonious Monk records. Everything that he represented was totally unworldly in a way, although at the same time jazz to me seemed more real than the environment in which I was living." [...] The Wall Street Journal Robert J. Toth writes, [...] "The cover adds another layer of autobiography. On the front, we see Mr. Fagen as a crew-cut deejay on the graveyard shift. On the back is his audience, a single lighted window in a row of tract homes — or maybe the artist as a young man, drinking in inspiration." [...] Robert Palmer, of The New York Times, continued in this line of thinking: [...] "Inside, there's a teenager with his ear next to a portable radio. He's playing it softly, so his parents won't wake up, and he can barely make out the sounds through the static. [...] The teenager was Donald Fagen." ...|$|E

The image of the UCID leader in Ceuta, Laarbi Maateis, is associated with radical Islamist movements by Morocco. For his part, Laarbi Maateis denied any involvement with fundamentalist movements, indicating that no member of Tablig had ever been arrested or identified as a suspect in connection with jihadism.

2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1979 {{the band}} felt {{confident}} enough to start recording their songs, and approached local musician Bob Lamb as {{he was the only}} person they knew with any recording experience. Lamb had been the drummer with the Steve Gibbons Band for much of the 1970s and was a well-known figure within the Birmingham music scene. <b>He</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> [...] "'King' was the very first song they ever played to me, and it just blew my mind basically, to realise a bunch of kids could make a sound like that... it blew me away. And that was it for me, I was hooked, it was a bit like Elvis walks in or something, you know, {{it was one of those}} moments." [...] However, as the band were unable to afford a proper recording studio, the album was recorded in Lamb's own home at the time, a ground-floor flat in a house on Cambridge Road in Birmingham's Moseley district that later became affectionately known as the [...] "Home of the Hits". Lamb would later use the money he earned from the album's success to build a proper recording studio, Highbury Studio, in an old cricket bat factory in nearby Kings Heath, which remained under his ownership until his retirement in 2010 – during the 1980s and 90s he would go on to produce the early demos for Duran Duran and work on the debut albums by fellow Birmingham natives Ruby Turner, The Lilac Time and Ocean Colour Scene.

2500|$|On 15 April 1878, Constable Strachan, {{the officer}} {{in charge of the}} Greta police station, learned that Kelly was at a certain {{shearing}} shed and went to apprehend him. As lawlessness was rampant at Greta, it was recognised that the police station could not be left without protection and Constable Alexander Fitzpatrick, who, like the Kellys, was also of Irish descent, was ordered there for relief duty. He was instructed to proceed directly to Greta but instead rode to the public house at Winton, five miles from Benalla police headquarters, where he spent considerable time. On resuming his journey, <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> a couple of days previously he had seen in The Police Gazette an arrest warrant for Dan Kelly for horse stealing. He went to the Kelly house to arrest him, despite a police policy that at least two constables participate in visits to the Kelly homestead. Finding Dan not at home, he remained with Kelly's mother and other family members, in conversation, for about an hour. According to Fitzpatrick, upon hearing someone chopping wood, he went to ensure that the chopping was licensed. The man proved to be William [...] "Bricky" [...] Williamson, a neighbour, who said that he needed a licence only if he was chopping on Crown land. (According to Williamson, he was at his own selection a half a mile from the Kellys and was arrested there when he refused to give information about the Kellys.) Fitzpatrick then observed two horsemen making towards the house he had just left. The men proved to be the teenager Dan Kelly and his brother-in-law, Bill Skillion. Fitzpatrick returned to the house and made the arrest. Dan asked to be allowed to have dinner before leaving. The constable consented, and took a seat near his prisoner. Whilst the constable was standing guard over Dan Kelly, the elder brother, Ned, rushed in and shot him in the left arm, two inches above the wrist, with a revolver. A struggle followed, and the brothers, assisted by their mother, Williamson and Skillian, soon over-powered the constable, and he was beaten to the ground insensible. On regaining consciousness, he was compelled by Ned Kelly to extract the bullet from his arm with a knife, so that it might not be used as evidence; and on promising to make no report against his assailants, he was allowed to depart. He had ridden away about a mile when he found that two horsemen were pursuing, but by spurring his horse into a gallop he escaped. On regaining safety he no longer considered the promise which he had made to the criminals as binding but reported the affair to his superior officer.|$|E
2500|$|On 24 August 2008, Georgian {{president}} Mikheil Saakashvili had {{a lengthy}} televised speech. <b>He</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> after 2004 Adjara crisis he phoned President Putin and thanked him.

[...] Saakashvili said that Georgia had expected a Russian attack from Abkhazia, rather than from South Ossetia, so major forces of the Georgian army were deployed in the Georgia's west.

[...] "But our major forces were still deployed in the west; there was a brigade at Senaki [...] and we did not call back our brigade from Iraq, because I was deeply convinced up to the last minute that Russia would not engage in such a large-scale provocation," [...] he said. [...] "Although we were under fire from 120mm mortar launchers, I announced a unilateral ceasefire; at that time we already had one dead soldier in the village of Avnevi and four others were wounded; [...] Kezerashvili was begging me to let him open artillery fire, because, he was telling me, otherwise he was unable to bring [...] from [...] But my response was that we could not open fire whatever happened," [...] he said. Saakashvili also said that the Russian army had moved into South Ossetia before the war had even started. [...] "When we ask our western partners: didn't you see them coming, they respond that their satellites were directed mainly on Iraq and that they could not fly over , but it was impossible {{to see what was happening}} on the ground because it was cloudy.
