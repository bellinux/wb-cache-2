And very smug … I'm in that mode now, so {{hopefully}} I'll stay {{in it for}} a while … I've <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{more things}} planned—at least a couple more albums, some EPs, things like that. Some more dance-y things I did about 10 years ago. Experimental things, noise things, weird things. Shitloads of stuff. They're all pretty much ready to go.|$|E
25|$|Here's {{the deal}} these days: They {{know exactly who}} we are. They know exactly where we live. We've <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> secrets left, and we're gonna use them. But just know that the end is coming. And we don't know how much longer we can do this. How much longer can we fight.|$|E
25|$|During 1932–1938 Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{orders from}} the state. One of them was {{passenger}} ship Jäämeri, {{which was to be}} operated in Petsamo, a couple of barges and icebreaker Otso. In 1934 followed a significant order from FÅA: a 2,800-tonne cargo ship Orion. The ship was propelled by an in-house built engine and she was the largest ship built in Finland until then.|$|E

25|$|On {{the evening}} of 25 November, {{resistance}} people <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hours' notice before the scheduled arrests and deportation of all Jews in Norway. Many {{did their best to}} notify the remaining Jews who were not already detained, usually by making brief phone calls or short appearances on people's doorsteps. This was more successful in Oslo than other areas. Those who were warned only had a few hours to go into hiding and days to find {{their way out of the}} country.|$|E
25|$|By {{virtue of}} his natural {{abilities}} and dogged, unrelenting self-determination, Parker taught himself how to sculpt and paint, although he didn't take up painting seriously until {{he was in his}} late 40s when he <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> informal personal painting lessons from his friend Don Oelze, a New Zealand-born master painter of Native American genre subjects. Parker was inspired in his pursuit of a career in art by witnessing the successful careers of fellow Kalispell artists Ace Powell, Frank Hagel, Mark Ogle, and others.|$|E
25|$|On 21 June 1985, the 737-200 LN-SUG Harald Gille Flight 139, with 121 {{passengers}} {{en route}} from Trondheim to Oslo, was hijacked by the 24-year-old Stein Arvid Huseby. He had threatened a flight attendant with an air gun. He demanded to talk to Prime Minister Kåre Willoch and Minister of Justice Mona Røkke and {{a press conference to}} make a political statement. Those demands were not met, and he surrendered after 4.5 hours after he demanded and <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> beers. This was the first hijacking in Norway.|$|E

50|$|Maćkowiak {{was also}} one of the favourites in the World Championships in Edmonton 2001). His main rival was German runner Ingo Schultz who had best times in {{qualification}} runs. Maćkowiak was a candidate for silver but he <b>got</b> <b>an</b> injury <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days before final and he lost all medal chances. He also didn't start in the relay run which took place <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days after individual start.|$|R
25|$|As {{the snow}} became deeper {{through the night}} there was panic because {{of the fear of}} being buried or suffocated. With {{daylight}} on Sunday, a boy could be heard shouting under the surface and Sunderland was barely conscious. Davidson and the other boy set off to get help but only <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> yards before they were forced back. Throughout the day the blizzard raged and after dark they could see the flares of a search party but their shouts were not heard and they had lost their own flares in the snow. During this night the children were becoming delirious and were dying. On Monday morning Davidson set off by herself to try to get rescue.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, TCU was {{the only}} non–AQ conference team to get a BCS bowl berth. Boise State was {{ranked in the top}} five for most of the season, but a late-season {{overtime}} loss to Nevada knocked the Broncos out of serious contention for a BCS bowl bid, despite their continuing eligibility. TCU would defeat Wisconsin 21–19 in the 2011 Rose Bowl, once again calling into question the claim of AQ conference superiority. There was a movement to lobby those voting in the AP poll, which is not bound to vote for the BCS Championship winner as the Coaches Poll is, to vote TCU first and split the National Championship. While TCU <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> first place votes, this effort did not change the outcome of the AP poll, and TCU ended up in the No. 2 spot in all of the final major polls. As Utah had already done, TCU soon joined a conference with an automatic BCS tie, namely the Big 12 Conference (home of several other former members of the Southwest Conference, which TCU competed in for over 70 years) beginning with the 2012 season.|$|E
500|$|Development on Crash of the Titans {{began after}} the {{completion}} of Crash Tag Team Racing. The graphics of the Wii version of the game was one of Radical Entertainment's main focuses in the game's development, with Radical stating that the Wii has [...] "a lot of horsepower under the hood" [...] and expressing their desire to make full use of it. They also considered implementing a feature to connect the Wii to DS during gameplay, but stopped due to technical issues and time. The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 2 version <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> extra months of development time to improve its graphics before setting a final release date.|$|E

500|$|In June 2009, Bono {{said that}} {{although}} the group had nine pieces of music they considered worth pursuing, the album would only be released if its quality surpassed that of No Line on the Horizon. In September, he first made claims that U2 were working on three separate album projects: a [...] "rocking club album" [...] comprising material the group previously wrote with producer Rick Rubin but shelved; the songs {{that he and the}} Edge had written for Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark; and Songs of Ascent. Bassist Adam Clayton was sceptical about Bono's statements, believing their material to still be in its infancy, while the Edge said he was not sure if the Spider-Man songs would be released as a U2 album or a cast recording, adding: [...] "The Spider-Man collection is the most developed but the least appropriate to the band. We've got so much material at different stages of completion, it's going to be a nice problem when we've <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks to look at it." [...] After the band performed at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin in November, Bono and the Edge traveled to the South of France for a two-week songwriting session, followed by a studio session in New York City in December.|$|E
500|$|Scherger quickly {{took to the}} art {{of flying}} open-cockpit biplanes and gained a {{reputation}} as a skilful if occasionally reckless pilot, being berated early in his career by his flight commander for [...] "inverted and very low flying". He was one of the Air Force's first volunteers for parachute instruction, under the tutelage of Flying Officer Ellis Wackett at RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales, and made the first public freefall descent in Australia, at Essendon, Victoria on 21August 1926. In February 1927, he was asked by the commanding officer of No.1 Flying Training School (No.1 FTS), Wing Commander Adrian [...] "King" [...] Cole, to drop a message to a woman at Port Melbourne before she departed on a steamer. After doing so, Scherger illegally flew his S.E.5 fighter between ship and wharf before heading back to Point Cook, only to be hauled into Cole's office the next morning to find the CO brandishing a photograph taken {{by a member of the}} public, catching the young pilot in the act. Sent for a dressing down to the Air Member for Personnel, Group Captain Jimmy Goble, Scherger was forced to admit it was not the first time he had engaged in such stunts. Goble responded, [...] "Good, I'm glad to see we've still <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> in the Air Force with spirit." ...|$|E
500|$|A reunion {{episode was}} speculated after the fifth series ended; in the 2003 {{documentary}} Cold Feet: The Final Call, executive producer Andy Harries stated, [...] "By killing a character, you are truly saying 'this series is over' … until, of course, in 10 years time when money {{is running a}} bit short for all of us, we bring it back. What we do with Rachel, I don't know yet—but I have <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> theories." [...] In an interview published in October 2003, Harries told The Daily Telegraph that ITV would [...] "probably" [...] bring back Cold Feet ten years after it ended, and said, [...] "There's a tacit understanding with the actors that we will re-visit it again at the appropriate time." [...] In 2007, a tabloid newspaper quoted an ITV [...] "insider" [...] as saying that a reunion episode would be broadcast to mark ten years since the pilot aired. The report {{turned out to be}} a fabrication. At the 2010 Edinburgh International Television Festival, Harries stated that discussions about the series' return were [...] "ongoing", but highlighted a number of factors that would prevent a reunion in the near future. The following day, Harries told Kate Silverton that he had held discussions with Mike Bullen about the series returning, but that it would not be back on television screens in 2011 or 2012.|$|E

500|$|... "Baby Don't Lie" [...] {{was written}} by Stefani, Ryan Tedder, Benny Blanco, and Noel Zancanella, with Tedder and Blanco also serving as the song's producers. It is a midtempo electropop and reggae-pop song which begins with Stefani announcing, [...] "Uh huh, here we go," [...] to a rubbery bass line and hand claps. The song also has a hip hop-inflected breakdown, in which Stefani raps, [...] "You can tell me what you're hidin' boy/And {{you can tell me}} if I'm gettin' warm". Lyrically, the song {{discusses}} insecurities in a relationship, where Stefani questions her man's love. Nolan Feeney of Time complimented that the song is [...] "about falling in love with someone who's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> skeletons in their closet." [...] As noted by Spins Brennan Carley, [...] "Stefani sounds shattered as she sings, [...] "But there's something behind those eyes / Those eyes / That you can't that you can't disguise / Disguise." [...] In the [...] "stomping, infuriatingly catchy" [...] chorus she sings, [...] "Baby don't, baby don't, baby don't lie…/I don't want to cry no longer." [...] Melodically, [...] "Baby don't Lie" [...] is written in the key of B♭ minor, performed in a common time moderate tempo of 100 beats per minute and follows the sequence B♭m - G♭ - D♭ as its chord progression. Stefani's voice spans two octaves from the lowest note A♭3 to the highest note A♭5.|$|E
500|$|... "At Long Last Leave" [...] has {{received}} generally positive reviews from television critics, [...] particularly for its couch gag in the Simpsons opening sequence. This couch gag features a frame-by-frame montage of previous couch gags that pulls {{back into a}} photomosaic of the number [...] "500". The A.V. Club critic Hayden Childs wrote that the [...] "best thing about the 500th Simpsons episode is the opening couch montage, which hits the nostalgia bullseye almost perfectly." [...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall praised the couch gag as being [...] "marvelous", noting that it [...] "actually made me choke up a bit." [...] Sepinwall commended [...] "At Long Last Leave", commenting that [...] "like many latter-day Simpsons outings, [...] features a story we've seen variations on several times before (including in The Simpsons Movie), but also features many funny jokes that affirm my belief that I'm happier {{to live in a}} world that keeps giving us new Simpsons episodes [...] than I will be in the one where that inevitably stops." [...] Similarly to Sepinwall, Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: [...] "I <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> laughs and that's all I ever look for in The Simpsons these days. I just like knowing it's still there. [...] It doesn't have the spring in the legs quite like it used to. It's not going to dazzle at the same spectacular rate. But even after 500 episodes, it still has a little something left." [...] Goodman described the couch gag as [...] "lovely".|$|E
500|$|Three days later, it was {{reported}} that Marvel was looking at Alan Taylor and Daniel Minahan as prospective directors to replace Jenkins, and were also in the midst of hiring a writer to rewrite Don Payne's script, with the shortlist of possible writers consisting of John Collee, Robert Rodat, and Roger Avary. At the end of the month, Alan Taylor, best known for directing episodes of the HBO fantasy series Game of Thrones, was chosen to direct the sequel. Feige mentioned Taylor's work on the series Mad Men, Boardwalk Empire and Game of Thrones as reasons for his hiring, saying [...] "With Alan's direction we <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> more layers of patina, of texture, of reality into our golden realm." [...] By January 10, Marvel Studios had commissioned screenwriter Robert Rodat to rewrite the sequel and Hiddleston stated that filming was expected to begin in London in the summer of 2012. Hemsworth later confirmed that filming was scheduled to begin in August. Hemsworth also revealed that the film would have a more Viking-influenced feel, elaborating [...] "I think the science fiction element to Thor… the danger is it falls a little bit into the world of it's 'tough to throw a light to.' I think of big waterfalls and mountains and a Viking influence, where the Norse mythology kind of grew from. Having that in Asgard {{is going to make it}} all the more special and that's what Alan [...] wants to bring to it." [...] Feige said [...] "while the relationship between Loki and Thor certainly has changed [...] and has progressed, a lot of Thor 2 is picking up where it left off in terms of Jane, who you just saw for a moment on a computer monitor, and also what's been going on in the nine realms without the Asgardians being able to use the Bifrost." [...] Feige also said that while Loki has a part, [...] "there will be a different villain, another big villain".|$|E

2500|$|Regarding the album's lyrical content, Corgan noted [...] "If {{you listen}} to the lyrics, it was written around some serious {{relationship}} strife.

Foot writes that Buttle was [...] "a very good club bowler, fast by those {{standards}} and able to move the ball away."
