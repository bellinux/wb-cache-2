The police officially denied any link, citing drug-related robbery as the motive and revealing that the game had been found in Pakeerah's bedroom, not Leblanc's. Thompson, who had heard of the murder, claimed that he had written to Rockstar after the game was released, warning them that the nature of the game could inspire copycat killings: [...] "I wrote warning them that somebody was going to copycat the Manhunt game and <b>kill</b> <b>somebody.</b> We have had dozens of killings in the U.S. by children who had played these types of games.

500|$|... "The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerBalls" [...] portrays young {{children}} as almost entirely uninterested in reading. The South Park boys only exhibit excitement for their reading assignment {{based on the}} promise of offensive and controversial material in the book. Rather than finding any merit in the book, the boys are angry when they find the material inoffensive, prompting Cartman to declare he has been [...] "tricked" [...] into reading an entire book. Through {{the rise and fall of}} Butters' career as an author, the episode also demonstrates the perils of literary success and hoaxes. The episode also lampoons the notion that a book can be identified as the sole reason for a reader to <b>kill</b> <b>somebody,</b> particularly through Butters' reaction to The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs. Butters experiences blackouts after reading The Catcher in the Rye and chanting [...] "Kill John Lennon/Ronald Reagan!", until he disappointedly learns they are already dead.

500|$|Germany {{initially}} {{tried to}} implicate British mines or torpedoes, but relented {{when confronted with}} evidence {{that it was one}} of their own torpedoes—which had been assigned to UB-13—that had sunk Tubantia. The Germans, however, presented a forged log from UB-13 that showed her nowhere near Tubantia at the time of the attack. Further, they reported, UB-13 had fired that specific torpedo at a British warship on 6 March—ten days before Tubantia was sunk—which would have been under her previous commander, Kapitänleutnant Neumann. The U.S. Minister to the Netherlands, Henry van Dyke, writing in Fighting for Peace in 1917, called this explanation [...] "amazing" [...] and derided it:This certain U-boat had fired this particular torpedo at a British war-vessel somewhere in the North Sea ten days before the Tubantia was sunk. The shot missed its mark. But the naughty undisciplined little torpedo went cruising around in the sea on its own hook for ten days waiting for a chance to <b>kill</b> <b>somebody.</b> Then the Tubantia came along and the wandering-Willy torpedo promptly, obstinately, ran into the ship and sank her. This was the explanation. Germany was not to blame.|$|E

Pugh later stated he panicked and stuttered upon hearing this question and, after sitting in silence for several minutes, attempted to leave the vehicle once Bonin had slowed the van at a stoplight. In response, Bonin wordlessly leaned across and grabbed Pugh by the collar, dragging him back into the passenger seat. According to Pugh, Bonin then confided in him that he enjoyed abducting young male hitchhikers on Friday and Saturday nights, whom he then restrained and abused before strangling them to death with their own T-shirts. In a matter-of-fact tone, Bonin then informed Pugh: [...] "If you want to <b>kill</b> <b>somebody,</b> you should make a plan and find a place to dump the body before you even pick a victim."

2500|$|The witness, Arthur Calgary, who {{was unaware}} of the events and thus failed to come forward and not {{otherwise}} locateable by the police, believed the family would be grateful once he cleared their son's name. He failed to realize the full implications of the information he provides. However, once he does so, he is determined to protect the innocent by finding the murderer. To be able to do so, he visits the retired local doctor, Dr MacMaster, to ask him about the now-cleared murderer, Jacko Argyle. MacMaster states that he was surprised when Jacko killed his mother. Not because he thought that murder was outside Jacko's 'moral range', but because he thought Jacko would be too cowardly to <b>kill</b> <b>somebody</b> himself; that, if he wanted to murder somebody, he would egg on an accomplice to do his dirty work. MacMaster says [...] "the kind of murder I'd have expected Jacko to do, if he did one, was the type where a couple of boys go out on a raid; then, when the police come after them, the Jackos say 'Biff him on the head, Bud. Let him have it. Shoot him down.' They're willing for murder, ready to incite to murder, but they've not got the nerve to do murder themselves with their own hands."

He also liked her involvement in Gundam SEED following her short appearance in the series' first episode. A similar comment was made by Ross Liversidge from UK Anime Network who praised Cagalli's return in the series {{due to the fact}} the importance from her role was found [...] "unexpected". Moreover, Liversidge favorited the episodes in which Cagalli and Athrun meet and fight for the first time, as it also developed their characters as the two talked. Writing for Mania, Chris Beveridge also liked Cagalli's involvement in the series citing her experience in combat as well as a romantic triangle that appeared to be between her, Kira and Flay Allster. In a later episode, Wolstenholme found that Cagalli's character had become more mature when she confronts Athrun about the reasons to <b>kill</b> <b>somebody</b> following her father's teachings, citing it as a strong quiet moments from the series. Reviewing the manga of Gundam SEED Destiny Julie Gray from Comic Book Bin praised Cagalli's romantical relationship with Athrun featured in the volume, emphasizing how integral is it to the story and pointing as the romantical theme brought by the series. Vanessa Morley's work as Cagalli's English voice actress was found to be [...] "satisfyingly tomboyish" [...] by Anime News Network writer Theron Martin despite noting that her Japanese voice actress, Naomi Shindō, portrayed more manly.|$|E
