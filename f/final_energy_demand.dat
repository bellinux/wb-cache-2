The scenario was initially confined to a full scale cattle slaughtering facility processing 3. 28 % of heads slaughtered in Ireland. The methane potential of dissolved air flotation sludge, paunch, soft offal as well as a mixed waste stream (combination of individual waste streams) was determined through a series of biochemical methane potential assays under mesophilic conditions. The methane potential of the characterised waste streams ranged from 49. 5 to 650. 9  mLCH 4  gVS− 1.

These results have important implications for the design of environmental policy. First, the fact that <b>final</b> <b>energy</b> <b>demand</b> is highly persistent means that the effects of environmental policies will tend to be long lasting.

Space conditioning, notably heating, is responsible for nearly 70 % of <b>final</b> residential <b>energy</b> consumption in Europe. There is therefore significant scope for the reduction of energy consumption through improvements to the energy efficiency of residential buildings. However, these certifications totally overlook the energy embodied in the building materials used to achieve this greater operational energy efficiency.

While some previous studies have assessed the life cycle <b>energy</b> <b>demand</b> of passive houses, including their embodied energy, these rely on incomplete assessment techniques which greatly underestimate embodied energy and can lead to misleading conclusions. This paper analyses the embodied and operational <b>energy</b> <b>demands</b> of a case study passive house using a comprehensive hybrid analysis technique to quantify embodied energy. Results show that the embodied energy is much more significant than previously thought. Also, compared to a standard house with the same geometry, structure, finishes and number of people, a passive house can use more energy over 80 years, mainly due to the additional materials required.

Studies on passive houses do not {{take into consideration the}} embodied energy required to manufacture the building materials, especially the large amount of insulation required to achieve high operational efficiencies. At an urban scale, most passive houses are single family detached houses located in low density suburbs with a high car usage, resulting in considerable transport related <b>energy</b> <b>demand.</b> This paper analyses the total life cycle <b>energy</b> <b>demand</b> of a typical Belgian passive house, comprising embodied, operational and transport energy.

Results show that current building energy efficiency certifications might not ensure a lower <b>energy</b> <b>demand</b> and can, paradoxically result in an increased energy consumption because of their limited scope. More comprehensive system boundaries should be used to make sure that net energy savings do occur. The embodied energy of passive houses can represent up to 77 % of the total embodied and operational energy over 100. years. Also passive houses can have nearly the same energy consumption as a standard new house with the same geometry, location and number of occupants.

40|$|Abstract]: This paper {{presents}} an economic perspective of rooftop solar systems {{consisting of a}} 1 kWp grid-connected photovoltaic (GC-PV) and an evacuated tube solar collector (ETC) water heater (1. 37 m 2 unit) {{as a case study}} at Christchurch, New Zealand. The study considers the case that both systems are partially covering the <b>energy</b> <b>demand</b> of a one-family house. According to the average availability of solar radiation at Christchurch the expected year ac energy yield of the 1 kWp GC-PV system {{has been found to be}} 1018 kWh/year and that of the solar thermal collector 851 kWh/year. Economic analysis has been carried out on the basis that PV electricity is fully used, either directly at user premises or by feeding the utility grid whereas the thermal energy made available by the solar collector is assisting the usual electrical water heating system to supply the necessary hotwater demand. The assumption made in this analysis is that the energy provided by the solar water heater is entirely replacing the otherwise used electricity for heating water. The <b>final</b> electrical <b>energy</b> <b>demand</b> after installing the solar system is then calculated. The presented analysis can be applied for larger capacities for commercial and industrial users considering that repetitive units of the here presented modules can be considered. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} first {{comprehensive}} estimate of the <b>final</b> <b>energy</b> <b>demand</b> for heat in all EU 28 member states for the reference year 2012, differentiated by temperature levels, comparing two different approaches. Two different calculation approaches based on different data sets yielded estimates of the total <b>final</b> <b>energy</b> <b>demand</b> for heat in the EU 28 of 8150 PJ and 8518 PJ in 2012, respectively. Approach 1 distinguishes between three different process heat (PH) temperature levels and results in <b>final</b> <b>energy</b> <b>demand</b> for heat 400 °C: 3859 PJ. The second approach distinguishes between low temperature space heat and hot water (< 100 °C: 1161 PJ) and four different PH temperature levels with a resulting energy demand of 1000 °C: 2865 PJ. The high share of high-temperature heat illustrates the limits to the potential decarbonisation of industrial thermal processes with renewable energy sources such as (non-concentrating) solar thermal, geothermal or environmental heat. Therefore specific information on required temperature levels is of the essence. This, in turn, points out the relevance of renewable electricity and synthetic fuels based on renewable power for a significant reduction of CO 2 emissions from the industry sector in Europe.

40|$|Anticipation of <b>final</b> user <b>energy</b> <b>demand</b> {{is central}} to suppliers' and policy makers' plans. Recent {{developments}} in dynamic econometrics, such as the cointegration approach, have enabled energy modellers to study long run relationships between demand and its determinants, principally economic activity and real prices. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to present the SEECEM output, elasticity estimates and forecasts using the cointegration approach, as well as the methodology and analysis underlying them. As economic activity is expected to grow in all but the iron and steel sector, the long run relationships indicate that most sectors will increase overall fuel use up to the year 2000. Despite weak but potentially volatile world oil prices and given stable environmental policies, average real oil prices should remain broadly constant except in the transport sector. Economic activity elasticities and increased competition in supply industries imply that natural gas and electricity are likely to take an increasing share of final user requirements at the expense of petroleum products and coal.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a simulation model, MEDEE 2, designed {{to evaluate the}} long-term <b>energy</b> <b>demand</b> of a country, in combination with a scenario description of the main aspects of the country's social, economic, and technological evolution. This approach considers in a detailed way a national <b>energy</b> <b>demand</b> pattern and breaks down the total demand in a multitude of end-use categories (e. g., residential space heating, service sector cooling, gasoline for intercity cars). By means of this detailed investigation of <b>energy</b> <b>demand</b> we {{are better able to}} take into account the influence on <b>energy</b> <b>demand</b> of changes in social needs, economic growth, government policies, or technologies, especially in the present context of high energy prices. In addition, it makes possible the identification of the potential market (i. e. maximum demand that can be technically met) of each <b>final</b> <b>energy</b> form (e. g., electricity, coal, gas, solar, oil products, and district heat). The model calculates useful <b>energy</b> <b>demand</b> in each end-use category for which several energy forms can be used, thus determining the substitution possibilities in energy use. This useful energy matches the energy service needed by the consumer (e. g., heat, mechanical energy). Useful <b>energy</b> differs from <b>final</b> <b>energy,</b> purchased by the consumer, by the efficiency of the enduse appliances. Each useful <b>energy</b> <b>demand</b> is then converted into a <b>demand</b> for <b>final</b> <b>energy,</b> taking into account the fuel mix (i. e., the fraction of the demand supplied by each fuel) and the end-use efficiencies of each fuel. This approach-estimating useful energy-is necessary if one wants to account for the differences in fuel efficiencies: for the same service (let us say 1 kwh of heat) the final demand will vary according to the fuel type because of these different efficiencies (e. g., 1 kwh of electricity, 1. 35 kwh of gas, 1. 50 kwh of oil, and 2 kwh of coal). The total final demand is projected in MEDEE 2 for the following types of <b>final</b> <b>energy</b> forms: fossil fuel '(substitutable use of coal, oil, and gas), electricity, motor fuel, coke, feedstock, solar, and district heat.

First, despite the effects of a policy shock on energy consumption will tend to disappear slowly, they preserve their temporary nature. This is good news for the success of the Portuguese green tax reform since fiscal neutrality may be achieved earlier and cause temporary budget imbalances for a smaller period. Second, given the temporary nature {{of the effects of the}} policy shock, long lasting effects on the final energy consumption will be achieved by means of a more permanent policy stance.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} mitigation analyses for the Hungarian energy and forestry sectors made {{in the framework of}} the U. S. Country Studies Program. The model system ENPEP was used to model the energy sector. We estimated CO 2 emissions according to different scenarios of <b>final</b> <b>energy</b> <b>demand</b> growth and development of the power sector. In case of the forestry sector four long term scenarios have been developed by the COMAP-CASMOR model. Carbon sequestration and costs have been calculated. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to measure the the effects of energy subsidy removal on total energy demand and {{potential}} energy savings in Malaysia. The Computable General Equilibrium Model are employed. Simulations based on different groups of scenarios have been developed. These are: (1) Simulating the implementation of energy subsidy reform by removing fuel subsidies. (2) Simulating the implementation of energy subsidy reform by removing fuel tax subsidies. (3) Simulating the implementation of energy subsidy reform by removing both fuel subsidies and fuel tax subsidies. The results showed that, the removing of both fuel and tax subsidy (Scenario 3) policy have a stronger effect on <b>final</b> <b>energy</b> <b>demand</b> and potential energy savings. The estimated results showing that the potential energy savings (7, 036 ktoe) from the total energy demand that could be grabbed under total subsidy removal is above to the target of National Energy Efficiency Master Plan (2010), that is 4, 000 ktoe across sectors, while the <b>final</b> <b>energy</b> <b>demand</b> itself contributed about 1, 558 ktoe or 39 % from the national target. Importantly, the energy subsidy reform policy has found to be an efficient policy mechanism that could support the National Energy Efficiency Master Plan, 2010, as well as support towards utilization of “fifth fuel” policy under the Malaysian Fuel Diversification Policy...|$|E
40|$|For any nation, {{sector-wise}} {{forecasts of}} <b>energy</b> <b>demand</b> and emissions are becoming valuable elements in devising its {{national and international}} policies relating to energy security, local environment, and global climate change. It is {{in this context that}} this work attempts to forecast India's possible <b>energy</b> <b>demands</b> and emissions adopting a key indicator approach on least cost generation expansion optimization methodology for a long time frame. This study developed key indicators for useful-energy demand for end-use sectors such as industry, commerce, and residence. Key indicators for transport sector and non-energy use sectors were developed on transport mobility demand and end-use fuel demand. The main drivers of these key indicators are socio-economic parameters. This work was conducted in a linear programmed (LP) TIMES G 5 model on TIMES modeling framework for model horizon of 1990 - 2100. By the end of the 21 st-century, India's <b>energy</b> <b>demands</b> are projected to be about 1825 Â Mtoe of primary energy, 1263 Â Mtoe of <b>final</b> <b>energy</b> consumption, 4840 Â TWh of electricity generations, 723 Â Mtoe of energy import, and 4414 Â Mt of CO 2 emissions. <b>Energy</b> <b>demand</b> <b>Energy</b> indicator Emission...|$|R
40|$|International {{building}} {{legislation is}} setting stronger and stronger {{requirements for the}} energy performance of buildings. The most recent example is the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive in the European Union. The improved energy performance of buildings can’t be achieved by additional insulation or more effective building systems only. A major influence factor on the energy quality is the ventilation technology and also the airtightness of the building. Some countries include in their energy decree already maximum air exchange rates, partly for all building types, partly only for those that include a mechanical ventilation system. Especially for high performance buildings which go beyond the national requirements, the infiltration losses become a significant factor to the energy performance. The paper presents a short overview on the existing airtightness requirements in different European countries and especially for high performance buildings as well as insights in how strong the impact of improved airtightness can be regarding the net, <b>final</b> and primary <b>energy</b> <b>demand</b> of a building...|$|R
40|$|In many {{countries}} of the European Union, the largest potential for energy efficiency improvements lies in retrofitting houses, since the energy consumption of residential and non-residential buildings in the European Union had the largest share with 39 % in 2009. Currently, {{there is a lack}} of information about the building stock and associated modelling tools, which can be used to assess such measurements as basis for energy efficiency strategies and policy design to be applied to the European building sector. Therefore, a methodology has been developed that represents the European building stock as reference buildings with the aim to assess the effects of energy saving measures. The model used for the building energy simulation is the Energy Assessment for Buildings Stocks (EABS). By applying the EABS model, the <b>final</b> <b>energy</b> and heating <b>demand</b> for the German residential stock could be calculated and provided a base for further investigation considering the assessment for retrofitting residential houses in Germany...|$|R
