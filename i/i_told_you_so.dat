2500|$|On April 10, 2007, a Bahamian {{judge ruled}} Larry Birkhead, photographer, {{as the father}} of Dannielynn. DNA tests had {{established}} Birkhead as the father, with 99.99% certainty. Commenting on the revelation, Birkhead stated, [...] "I hate {{to be the one to}} tell you this but, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>so.</b> I'm the father...My baby's going to be coming home pretty soon." [...] Birkhead subsequently applied for an amended birth certificate listing him as the father, which paved the way for him to obtain a passport for the baby to leave with him for the United States. Howard K. Stern did not contest the DNA results or the ruling. Subsequent to the ruling, Birkhead returned to the United States with the baby. Smith's mother, Virgie Arthur, appealed the ruling but it was later denied and she was ordered to pay costs.|$|E
