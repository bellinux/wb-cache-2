5|$|As {{attachment}} theory {{offers a}} broad, far-reaching {{view of human}} functioning, it can enrich a therapist's understanding of patients and the therapeutic relationship rather than dictate a particular form of treatment. Some forms of psychoanalysis-based therapy for adults—within relational psychoanalysis and other approaches—also incorporate attachment theory and patterns. In {{the first decade of}} the 21st century, key concepts of attachment were incorporated into existing models of behavioural couple therapy, multidimensional <b>family</b> <b>therapy</b> and couple and <b>family</b> <b>therapy.</b> Specifically attachment-centred interventions have been developed, such as attachment-based <b>family</b> <b>therapy</b> and emotionally focused therapy.|$|E

40|$|PhD (Social Work), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Child {{sexual abuse}} (CSA) {{is a major}} concern in the South African society. Although {{policies}} and legislation are directed at the protection of children, the high incidence of child sexual abuse is indicative of problems in society which cannot be addressed adequately with current service delivery. Individual interventions with children directly affected with CSA are still the norm, and even such services are inadequate to accommodate the high numbers of children affected by CSA. There is a polarity in terms of the shortage of social workers versus the need for intervention for this vulnerable group. Innovative and effective approaches to intervention for families affected by CSA were clearly needed. Based on practical experience in the field of CSA the researcher was interested in <b>family</b> play <b>therapy</b> as a possible approach to address CSA. Not only would more people be reached with limited services, but by involving family members in intervention it was envisaged that family systems would be strengthened, family members would be more attuned to each other and that the family would be more able to provide a safe space for the direct victim between sessions. Furthermore family members would be enabled to attend to their own processes of integration regarding the CSA. Intervention research guided this study aimed at developing tools for the helping profession. The research question focused on what the typical components would be of an integrated <b>family</b> play <b>therapy</b> approach. Participant groups included professionals working in the field of CSA. Focus groups and discussion groups with such professionals and also a literature review helped the researcher to identify functional elements to be included in a preliminary <b>family</b> play <b>therapy</b> model that was applied to four families who were affected by CSA. During the <b>family</b> play <b>therapy</b> sessions rich information was obtained on the experiences of families. Based on the data collection from the various participant groups an integrated <b>family</b> play <b>therapy</b> model was developed. Findings are reported in three articles. Article 1 outlines the views of professionals on <b>family</b> play <b>therapy</b> within the context of child sexual abuse in South Africa. The professional participants agreed that individual intervention in the context of CSA is not the ideal and that systemic, Gestalt-based <b>family</b> play <b>therapy</b> may offer avenues for trauma integration for family members. They also indicated {{that they do not have}} adequate knowledge and skills to engage in <b>family</b> play <b>therapy.</b> They made some suggestions for the incorporation of play in <b>family</b> play <b>therapy</b> interventions. The second article captured the experiences of family members as expressed in the <b>family</b> play <b>therapy</b> context and article 3 outlined an integrated <b>family</b> play <b>therapy</b> model based on the previous phases of the intervention research.

The witness group was under standard treatment of national protocols of Ministry and Health and Social Welfare Organization. The differentiation questionnaire and family function assessment were administered among two groups. Results: The result showed that Bowen’s <b>Family</b> System <b>therapy</b> increased differentiation and improved the function of addicted persons and their families. Conclusion: The addicted persons and their families have low differentiation that can be caused to family dysfunction. Bowen’s <b>Family</b> System <b>therapy</b> can be useful in this purpose...|$|R
