They meet a local detective, Angela White (Dana Wheeler-Nicholson), {{and go to}} Boom's funeral. Scully, in a bad mood, is skeptical of these claims. The <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>principal,</b> Bob Spitz, interrupts the funeral by ranting Inquisitorial-style about Satanic cults murdering their children when suddenly the coffin starts smoking and catches on fire. Mulder and Scully go into separate rooms to interview Margi and Terri, both of whom offer an identical story about a satanic ceremony where a baby was sacrificed. Scully thinks their stories are cliché and points {{out the fact that}} the belief in a satanic conspiracy is illogical and paranoid. Looking at the latest victim's body, Mulder and Detective White find a burn mark {{in the shape of a}} horned beast; Scully says she doesn't see anything. Mulder goes to see White to apologize for Scully's behavior and the two visit the local astrologist Madame Zirinka who claims the town's crazy behavior is due to the rare planetary alignment of the planets Mars, Uranus, and Mercury. Terri and Margi watch basketball practice, lusting over one of the players, Scott, whose girlfriend is fellow cheerleader Brenda (much to Terri and Margi's displeasure). One of the other players accidentally spills a table of drinks on them, so they cause the basketball to bounce underneath the bleachers and it closes when he goes to get it, killing him. Scully is angry at Mulder for ditching her to be with Detective White.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This thesis aims {{to explore}} the role of {{entrepreneurship}} education in Finnish <b>high</b> <b>schools</b> {{from the perspective of}} <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>principals</b> and entrepreneurship education professionals. The key research questions are: 1 : How do <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>principals</b> and entrepreneurship education professionals define entrepreneurship education and understand its (potential) role in Finnish <b>high</b> <b>schools?</b> What are the main commonalities and differences in their perceptions? 2 : What is the particular role of <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>principals</b> in the implementation of entrepreneurship education in Finland? How do <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>principals</b> perceive themselves in this potential role, and what are the main standpoints of entrepreneurship education professionals? Theories and methods: Based on a review of the recent entrepreneurship education literature, the thesis identifies the under-researched role of entrepreneurship education in <b>high</b> <b>schools.</b> Following this, it draws upon in-depth interviews with <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>principals</b> and entrepreneurship education experts to examine the nature of discourses around entrepreneurship education in Finland. Key contributions: This thesis contributes to entrepreneurship education research by providing novel insight into the particular role of principals in the implementation of entrepreneurship education in <b>high</b> <b>schools.</b> The thesis highlights the different understandings and sense-making of the notion 'entrepreneurship education' between <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>principals</b> and entrepreneurship education professionals, and emphasizes the needed for further research on how to build a greater awareness of what 'entrepreneurship education' means and how it can be adequately implemented in <b>high</b> <b>schools...</b>|$|R

The {{purpose of the study was}} to examine the role of <b>high</b> <b>school</b> assistant <b>principals</b> in decision making as viewed by both <b>high</b> <b>school</b> assistant <b>principals</b> and principals. The population studied consisted of all <b>high</b> <b>school</b> assistant <b>principals</b> and all <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>principals</b> in buildings with at least one assistant <b>principal</b> from public <b>high</b> <b>schools</b> in the state of Illinois, excluding the city of Chicago. A mailed questionnaire was used to collect the data. Of the 281 questionnaires mailed to <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>principals,</b> 192 questionnaires were returned and used in the study (68. 3 %). Of the 429 questionnaires mailed to <b>high</b> <b>school</b> assistant <b>principals,</b> 350 questionnaires were returned and used in the study (81. 6 %). <b>High</b> <b>school</b> assistant <b>principals</b> and principals were asked to indicate their opinions about the actual and desired degree of participation by <b>high</b> <b>school</b> assistant <b>principals</b> in 52 decision situations grouped into eight decision areas. Respondents indicated one of six degrees of participation ranging from the assistant principal not being involved in the decision to the assistant principal making the decision. The data was tested for significance using chi-square (significance =. 05). The study supported the following conclusions concerning the role of <b>high</b> <b>school</b> assistant <b>principals</b> in decision making:(1) <b>High</b> <b>school</b> assistant <b>principals</b> desired a higher degree of participation in decision making in all decision situations in all decision areas than they perceived they actually had. (2) In most decision situations concerning instructional materials and equipment, school district policy and procedures, school district and school building finance, and school district and school building community relations, <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>principals</b> desired a <b>higher</b> degree of participation in decision making by assistant principals than they perceived was the actual degree of participation by assistant principals. In addition, it was concluded that in decisions concerning supervision of teachers, instructional organization and methods, facility planning and operation, and school building policy and procedures, <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>principals</b> perceived their assistant principals participating in decision making at the degree of participation they desired for their assistant principals. (3) In most decision situations concerning facility planning and operation, school district policy and procedure, and school district and school building community relations, <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>principals</b> perceived their assistant principals participating in decision making at a higher degree than assistant principals perceived they had. In most decision situations concerning supervision of teachers, instructional materials and equipment, instructional organization and methods, school building policy and procedure, and school district and school building finance, there was no difference in <b>high</b> <b>school</b> principals' and assistant principals' perceptions about the actual degree of participation by assistant principals in decision making. (4) There was little difference between <b>high</b> <b>school</b> assistant principals' desired degree of participation in decision making and the degree to which <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>principals</b> desired their assistant principals to participate. (5) There was little difference between <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>principals</b> who had never been assistant <b>principals</b> and <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>principals</b> who had been assistant principals as to the degree to which they desired their assistant principals to participate in decision making.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to gain insight about <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>principals</b> who are {{considered}} effective by organizations and institutions in the state of Indiana. Through a qualitative study, five Indiana <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>principals</b> participated in an interview with 26 structured questions.

Gender, race, or ethnic differences were not considered. State and federal test results were not a deciding factor for selection. There were five conclusions as a result of this study: 1. The preparation program establishes a solid base for aspiring principals regardless of program or internship. In addition, new principals benefit from an informal mentor. 2. Increased accountability is seen as a positive rather than a negative by effective principals. 3.

25|$|University of California, Berkeley Professor David L. Kirp, in his 2011 book, Kids First, and his 2013 book, Improbable Scholars, praised Union City's {{education}} system for bringing poor, mostly immigrant kids (three quarters of whom live in homes where only Spanish is spoken {{and a quarter}} of which {{are thought to be}} undocumented and fearful of deportation) into the educational mainstream. Kirp, who spent a year in Union City examining its schools, notes that while in the late 1970s, Union City schools faced the threat of state takeover, they now boast achievement scores that approximate the statewide average. Kirp also observes that in 2011, Union City boasted a high school graduation rate of 89.5 percent—roughly 10 percentage points higher than the national average, and that in 2012, 75 percent of Union City graduates enrolled in college, with top students winning scholarships to the Ivy League. Kirp singles out the city's practice of enrolling almost every 3- and 4-year-old in kindergarten, and the leadership of Union City <b>High</b> <b>School</b> <b>principal</b> John Bennetti for the positive educational atmosphere in that school.|$|E

The public <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>principals</b> 2 ̆ 7 responses to the constructs on the MSQ were compiled and analyzed. The MSQ constructs were ranked from high to low. A multiple regression procedure was used to predict the effect of five factors (age, salary, school size, degree attainment, and experience) upon job satisfaction. Telephone interviews were conducted with the four highest and four lowest scores generated on the short form MSQ. The long form MSQ was used for the telephone interviews as well as the same demographic questions. ^ Findings of the study revealed that the general satisfaction scores of the Nebraska public <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>principals</b> were above average when compared to scores of norm groups established for the MSQ. The analysis of the 20 constructs of the MSQ indicated that Nebraska public <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>principals</b> found the most satisfaction in the variety of their job, the chance to do things for other people, the ability to keep busy, and the way their job provides steady employment. The areas in which Nebraska public <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>principals</b> found the least satisfaction were the lack of recognition they received for doing a good job, pay for the amount of work that they did, advancement opportunities, and the way that the superintendents handled their subordinates.
