The phase {{difference between the two}} beams results in a change in the intensity of the light on the detector. The resulting intensity of the light after mixing of these two beams is measured, or the pattern of interference fringes is viewed or recorded.

25|$|A {{deductive}} {{system is}} sound if any formula {{that can be}} derived in the system is logically valid. Conversely, a deductive system is complete if every logically valid formula is derivable. All of the systems <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> article are both sound and complete. They also share the property {{that it is possible}} to effectively verify that a purportedly valid deduction is actually a deduction; such deduction systems are called effective.|$|E
25|$|At {{the dawn}} of the 20th century, the {{interest}} in analysis situs did not stay unnoticed. However, the necessity of a theorem equivalent to the one <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> article was not yet evident. Piers Bohl, a Latvian mathematician, applied topological methods to the study of differential equations. In 1904 he proved the three-dimensional case of our theorem, but his publication was not noticed.|$|E
25|$|In English {{and also}} in Scandinavian languages, the word smörgåsbord (or in English, more usually without {{diacritics}} as smorgasbord) refers loosely to any buffet {{with a variety of}} dishes — not necessarily with any connection to the Swedish Christmas traditions <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> article. In an extended sense, the word is used to refer to any situation which invites patrons to select whatever they wish among lots of pleasant things, such as the smorgasbord of university courses, books in a bookstore, etc.|$|E

25|$|The {{method of}} {{expansion}} <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> article, {{in which a}} gas or liquid at pressure P1 flows into a region of lower pressure P2 without significant change in kinetic energy, is called the Joule–Thomson expansion. The expansion is inherently irreversible. During this expansion, enthalpy remains unchanged (see proof below). Unlike a free expansion, work is done, causing a change in internal energy. Whether the internal energy increases or decreases is determined by whether work is done on or by the fluid; that {{is determined by the}} initial and final states of the expansion and the properties of the fluid.|$|E
25|$|In {{the normal}} {{anatomy of the}} hip joint, the root (the thigh bone) is {{connected}} to the pelvis at the hip joint. The almost spherical end of the femur head (the caput, or caput ossis femoris) fits into the acetabulum (a concave socket located in the pelvis). The bony surfaces of the femur head and of the acetabulum are covered by cartilage. While bones provide the strength necessary to support body weight, cartilage ensures a smooth fit and a wide range of motion. Normal hip function can be affected by congenital conditions such as dysplasia, <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> article, trauma, and by acquired diseases such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
25|$|IWF {{filtering}} {{has been}} criticised as interfering with legitimate Internet activity while being ineffective against anyone intending to access objectionable content. One carefully argued discussion, while opposing {{such things as}} child pornography and terrorism, points out that filtering has side effects, as <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> section, and would not stop access to material such as images {{of child sexual abuse}} as it would not stop email, ftp, https, p2p, usenet, irc, or many other ways to access the same content. As there are simple encryption systems, it never can stop it - at best it just drives it underground and harder to assess and track.|$|E
