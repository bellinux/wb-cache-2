O'Neill had {{been approached by}} the Nixon administration {{to work through the}} Vietnam Veterans for a Just Peace to counter Kerry's influence on the public. The debate went poorly for the pro-war side, so angering President Nixon that he is heard discussing the incident on the Watergate tapes, saying, [...] "Well, <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>way</b> we can screw him ? That's what I mean. There must be ways." [...] H.R. Haldeman, White House Chief of Staff, answered, [...] "We've been trying to." ...|$|E

The land itself ceased at the county road. Outside was the common domain of all gods--the roads and streets. Then inside other fences were the particular domains of other gods. A myriad laws governed all these things and determined conduct; yet {{he did not know}} the speech of the gods, nor <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>way</b> for him to learn save by experience. He obeyed his natural impulses until they ran him counter to some law. When this had been done a few times, he learned the law and after that observed it.|$|R

50|$|The QuickTake 100 was {{released}} in 1994 as an easy-to-use digital camera that connected to any Macintosh computer by way of an Apple serial cable. The camera was capable of storing eight photos at 640×480 resolution, 32 photos at 320×240 resolution, or a mixture of both sizes. All photos were at 24-bit color. The camera had a built-in flash, but no focus or zoom controls.

40|$|The present {{article focuses}} on the {{physical}} decline and the aesthetic dimension of feminine decrepitude {{at the beginning of}} Modern Times, trough images and statements of art theorists, artists and poets. The centre of our reflection is the aged and aging female body, which represented the absolute opposite to the existing renaissance discourse on feminine beauty. Confronted with the praise of an always admired youth, how did written and pictorial sources express the alteration due to feminine aging, and <b>were</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>ways</b> to react to the effects of old age? Possible answers to these questions emerge through the analysis of images and texts facing the problem, as well as trough the study of the representation of the aging process itself, visible in images depicting a young woman at the mirror facing her aged reflection...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, {{you are a}} {{precious}} crew, not to put it too strong. I think I begin to see now why you {{have always been a}} trifle inconsistent with me. In your anxiety to get all the juice you can out of a sin, you make a man repent of it in three or four different ways. For instance, you found fault with me for lying to that tramp, and I suffered over that. But it was only yesterday that I told a tramp the square truth, to wit, that, it being regarded as bad citizenship to encourage vagrancy, I would give him nothing. What did you do then: Why, you made me say to myself, 'Ah, it would have been so much kinder and more blameless to ease him off with a little white lie, and send him away feeling that if he could not have bread, the gentle treatment was at least something to be grateful for!' Well, I suffered all day about that. Three days before I had fed a tramp, and fed him freely, supposing it a virtuous act. Straight off you said, 'Oh, false citizen, to have fed a tramp!' and I suffered as usual. I gave a tramp work; you objected to it--after the contract was made, of course; you never speak up beforehand. Next, I refused a tramp work; you objected to that. Next, I proposed to kill a tramp; you kept me awake all night, oozing remorse at every pore. Sure I was going to be right this time, I sent the next tramp away with my benediction; and I wish you may live as long as I do, if you didn't make me smart all night again because I didn't kill him. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>way</b> of satisfying that malignant invention which is called a conscience?" ...|$|E
6000|$|That, {{like it or}} not, is the way {{to learn}} to write; whether I have profited or not, that is the way. It was so Keats learned, and there was never a finer {{temperament}} for literature than Keats's; it was so, if we could trace it out, that all men have learned; and that is why a revival of letters is always accompanied or heralded by a cast back to earlier and fresher models. Perhaps I hear some one cry out: [...] "But {{this is not the way}} to be original!" [...] It is not; nor <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>way</b> but to be born so. Nor yet, if you are born original, is there anything in this training that shall clip the wings of your originality. There can be none more original than Montaigne, neither could any be more unlike Cicero; yet no craftsman can fail to see how much the one must have tried in his time to imitate the other. Burns is the very type of a prime force in letters: he was of all men the most imitative. Shakespeare himself, the imperial, proceeds directly from a school. It is only from a school that we can expect to have good writers, it is almost invariably from a school that great writers, these lawless exceptions, issue. Nor is there anything here that should astonish the considerate. Before he can tell what cadences he truly prefers, the student should have tried all that are possible; before he can choose and preserve a fitting key of language, he should long have practised the literary scales; and it is only after years of such gymnastic that he can sit down at last, legions of words swarming to his call, dozens of turns of phrase simultaneously bidding for his choice, and he himself knowing what he wants to do and (within the narrow limit of a man's ability) able to do it.|$|E

50|$|The {{proposed}} {{definition of}} the new real number r clearly includes a finite sequence of characters, and hence it seems at first to be a definition of a real number. However, the definition refers to definability-in-English itself. If it were possible to determine which English expressions actually do define a real number, and which do not, then the paradox would go through. Thus the resolution of Richard's paradox <b>is</b> that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> not <b>any</b> <b>way</b> to unambiguously determine exactly which English sentences are definitions of real numbers (see Good 1966). That <b>is,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> not <b>any</b> <b>way</b> to describe in {{a finite number of}} words how to tell whether an arbitrary English expression is a definition of a real number. This is not surprising, as the ability to make this determination would also imply the ability to solve the halting problem and perform any other non-algorithmic calculation that can be described in English.|$|R
