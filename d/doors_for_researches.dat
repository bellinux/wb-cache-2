It was found that treatment of (1, 4 -dimethoxynaphthalen- 2 -yl) (2 - hydroxyphenyl) methanone with ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) resulted {{in the formation of}} 12 a-methoxy- 5 H-benzo[c]xanthene- 5, 7 (12 aH) -dione as the product. The structure was confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Exposure of a related compound (2, 5 -dimethoxyphenyl) (2 -hydroxyphenyl) methanone to CAN afforded 2 -methoxy- 9 H-xanthen- 9 -one as the major product with 4 amethoxy- 2 H-xanthene- 2, 9 (4 aH) -dione formed as the minor product.

40|$|Historically {{cyclooxygenase}} (COX) - 2 {{has been}} associated with the pro-inflammatory phase of inflammation; recently there is evidence to suggest the protein also has an anti-inflammatory role. A number of research groups have given in vivo evidence showing inhibition of COX- 2 in the late stages of the inflammatory response to exacerbate inflammation suggesting COX- 2 to also play a pro-resolution role 1.

40|$|In {{this issue}} of British Journal of Pharmacology, Megías and colleagues {{demonstrate}} how preincubation of human colonic Caco- 2 cells with CORM- 2, a carbon monoxide releasing molecule (CO-RM), reduces the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, interleukin (IL) - 6 and IL- 8 caused by proinflammatory cytokines. A role for IL- 6 in the regulation of metalloproteinase (MMP) - 7 expression by CORM- 2 is described. However, it is the demonstration that CORM- 2 inhibits MMP- 7 or matrilysin expression, which is most intriguing as this small MMP has been implicated in carcinogenesis. Thus, CO-RMs appear to now possess chemoprotective properties and, in this particular case, may influence inflammation-induced colon carcinogenesis via modulation of nuclear factors participating in the transcription of genes implicated {{in the development of}} intestinal inflammation and cancer.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{describe}} more complex problem using {{the concept of}} fractional derivatives, we introduce in this paper the concept of fractional derivatives with orders. The new definitions are based upon the concept of power law together with the generalized Mittag-Leffler function.

Each order therefore plays an important rule while modelling for instance problems with two layers with different properties. This is the case for instance in thermal science for a reaction diffusion within a media with two different layers with different properties. Another case is that of groundwater flowing within an aquifer where geological formation is formed with two layers with different properties.

In this position paper we review existing work that changes physical property perception, and propose methods for changing perceived object density during haptic interaction.

We hypothesize that augmented sound can make people think that an object is hollow or solid regardless of its actual object density. We describe an experiment to validate this hypothesis. Participants tap a hollow or solid cube and are asked to determine if it is hollow or solid, based on the multimodal feedback.

40|$|Problem statement: Simulated Annealing (SA) {{algorithms}} {{have been}} used in solving a wide range of discrete optimization problems for many years, with well know drawbacks like the computational time and difficulties related to the parameters settings. One of the other issues that open the <b>door</b> <b>for</b> <b>research</b> is the acceptance decision that provides for hill climbing; the standard SA algorithms use a stochastic method which fails to justify the acceptance of a cost increasing solutions while rejecting mildly cost increasing ones. Approach: To resolve this dilemma, the reversible deformation mechanism we developed earlier replaced the stochastic decision with a deterministic one; by deforming the problem structure and gradually reforming it towards the original one. This provides for hill climbing in the real domain while applying a simple downhill search in the virtual sense. Unlike the standard SA algorithm, the number of iterations must be known in advance and it is the only stopping criteria, because the scaling functions parameters are selected {{based on the number of}} iterations. Results: This method had produced better solutions and the new enhancement to the algorithm improves the overall performance by examining each state more thoroughly through a set of perturbations and thus securing a move towards a better neighborhood, the same set of tests used in the original methods are repeated for comparison. Conclusion: The significance of this research comes from eliminating the unpredictability of the stochastic decisions in the standard SA algorithms which might yield less than acceptable solutions in some cases...|$|R

We have given an existence theorem on common attractive points. Then, using a two-mapping variant of Picard-Mann iterative process, we have approximated the common attractive points of further generalized hybrid mappings in Hilbert spaces without closedness on its subsets.
