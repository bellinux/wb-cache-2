5|$|Due to {{the tree}} of heaven's weedy habit, landowners and other organisations often resort to various methods of control {{in order to keep}} its populations in check. For example, the city of Basel in Switzerland has an {{eradication}} program for the tree. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> difficult to eradicate, however. Means of eradication can be physical, thermal, managerial, biological or chemical. A combination of several of these can be most effective, though they must of course be compatible. All have some positive and negative aspects, but the most effective regimen is generally a mixture of chemical and physical control. It involves the application of foliar or basal herbicides in order to kill existing trees, while either hand pulling or mowing seedlings in order to prevent new growth.|$|E

25|$|Over time, key {{documents}} {{like the}} Sumerian King List were repeatedly copied across the generations.

25|$|Another primary condition, called Katayama fever, {{may also}} develop from {{infection}} with these worms, and <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> difficult to recognize.

25|$|Another form {{of grief}} in animals is when an {{individual}} loses its mate; this can be especially brutal when the species is monogamous. So when a pair bonding species, such as a black-backed jackal, loses its mate <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> difficult for it to detach itself from its dead mate.|$|E
25|$|Käfer Wiesn-Schänke – The {{smallest}} of the large tents at the Oktoberfest, it is frequented by celebrities, and {{is known for its}} especially good – and expensive – food. In contrast to the other tents (which must close by 11pm), it is open until 12:30am, and <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> difficult to gain admittance.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the vagaries}} of the cube tower, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> {{difficult}} to predict the outcome of any battle. Many cubes can be poured into the tower, while only a few may come out. During initial setup, armies from all players are added to the tower as well, so {{it is also possible that}} in some battles, more cubes come out than were poured in.|$|E
25|$|Some {{producers}} also {{profit from}} the indirect benefits of fair trade practices. Fair trade cooperatives create a space of solidarity and promote an entrepreneurial spirit among growers. When growers {{feel like they have}} control over their own lives within the network of their cooperative, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> empowering. Operating a profitable business allows growers to think about their future, rather than worrying about how they are going to survive in poverty.|$|E

Other children who are likely candidates for desmopressin treatment are those in whom alarm therapy has failed or those considered unlikely to comply with alarm therapy. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> useful for summer camp and sleepovers to prevent enuresis.|$|E

Furthermore, separators must be chemically inert to protect the electrolyte's stability and conductivity. Inexpensive components use open capacitor papers.

25|$|Akola {{is located}} at {{latitude}} 20.7° North and longitude 77.07° East. It is {{at an altitude of}} 925ft (287m) to 1036.745ft (316m) above sea level. Akola has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification Aw) bordering humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification Cwa), and people predominately wear cotton clothes. Akola has a National Weather Station which serves as the local weather centre. Annual temperatures range from a high of 47.6°C (117.68°F) to a low of 2.2°C (35.96°F). Akola lies near the Tropic of Cancer and becomes very hot during the summer, especially in May. Although <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> hot in the day, it is cooler at night. The annual rainfall averages 800mm. Most of the rainfall occurs in the monsoon season between June and September, but some rain does fall during January and February.|$|E
25|$|I {{think every}} {{director}} {{thinks that he}} hasn't been allowed to make the films he wanted to make. I certainly haven't {{been able to make}} as many Westerns as I've wanted. (But) sometimes staying alive in a career sense is very important, and you think, 'Maybe I'll do this, which will do well and allow me to do that.' It's very easy to miscalculate. It's a dangerous game. But I think in the end, none of us have anybody to blame except ourselves. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> hard. The kinds of things that directors most want to do are usually not things the studio perceives to be commercially viable. It really is that simple. Is that true of me? Sure. Absolutely. But it's no more true of me than 50 other people I know.|$|E

25|$|Another {{method of}} manual {{calibration}} requires {{a pair of}} high-quality headphones patched into the input signal before any processing (such as the pre-fade-listen of the test program input channel of the mixing console, or the headphone output of the CD player or tape deck). One can then use this direct signal as a near-perfect reference with which to find any differences in frequency response. This method may not be perfect, but <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> helpful with limited resources or time, such as using pre-show music to correct for the changes in response caused {{by the arrival of}} a crowd. Because this is still a very subjective method of calibration, and because the human ear is so dynamic in its own response, the program material used for testing should be as similar as possible to that for which the system is being used.|$|E
25|$|Improvisational Music Therapy (IMT), is {{increasing}} in popularity as a therapeutic technique being applied {{to children with}} ASD. The process of IMT occurs when the client and therapist make up music, {{through the use of}} various instruments, song and movement. The specific needs of each child or client need to be taken into consideration. Some children with ASD find their different environments chaotic and confusing, therefore, IMT sessions require the presence of a certain routine and be predictable in nature, within their interactions and surroundings. Music can provide all of this, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> predicable, it is highly repetitious with its melodies and sounds, but easily varied with phrasing, rhythm and dynamics giving it a controlled flexibility. The allowance of parents or caregivers to sessions can put the child at ease and allow for activities to be incorporated into everyday life.|$|E
25|$|M. drewseni {{typically}} feed on nectar, pulp (paper), {{and other}} insects. Most foraging for food occurs {{close to the}} nest (within 40–50 m). When this species preys on other insects, it typically snatches the prey, chews it into a pulp and then returns to the nest. Foragers also have been seen attacking insects that are stuck on spiders’ webs. ll captured prey tends to be fairly substantial in size (greater than 3mm) but small enough that the wasp could chew the whole insect {{before returning to the}} nest. Because foragers chew their prey so quickly, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> hard to determine exactly what their prey is. In fact, M. flavitarsis is the only Mischocyttarus species with published prey information. They reportedly prey on flies and caterpillars and, occasionally, meat and fish. Aside from various prey, nectar {{plays a key role in}} M. drewseni diets. This nectar is typically consumed from the buds and flowers of Althernanthera ficoidae, Hyptis atrorubens, and Clidemia hirta. Once a wasp finds a good source of nectar, it tends to return to it many times, just like workers return to the same nest material supply. This seems to be an individual venture, as there is no communication between foragers when a good nectar supply is located.|$|E

500|$|Spanish {{critic and}} philosopher Miguel de Unamuno {{comments}} of the book, [...] "I never took Facundo by Sarmiento {{as a historical}} work, nor do I think <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> valued in that regard. I always {{thought of it as}} a literary work, as a historical novel". However, Facundo cannot be classified as a novel or a specific genre of literature. According to González Echevarría, the book is at once an [...] "essay, biography, autobiography, novel, epic, memoir, confession, political pamphlet, diatribe, scientific treatise, [...] travelogue". Sarmiento's style and his exploration of the life of Facundo unify the three distinct parts of his work. Even the first section, describing Argentina's geography, follows this pattern, since Sarmiento contends that Facundo is a natural product of this environment.|$|E
