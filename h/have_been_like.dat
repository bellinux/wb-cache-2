5|$|In 1908 Prus serialized, in the Warsaw Tygodnik Ilustrowany (Illustrated Weekly), {{his novel}} Dzieci (Children), {{depicting}} the young revolutionaries, terrorists and anarchists {{of the day}} â€” an uncharacteristically humorless work. Three years later a final novel, Przemiany (Changes), was to <b>have</b> <b>been,</b> <b>like</b> The Doll, a panorama of society and its vital concerns. However, in 1911-12 the novel had barely begun serialization in the Illustrated Weekly when its composition was cut short by Prus' death.|$|E
5|$|Because {{language}} {{emerged in}} the early prehistory of man, before the existence of any written records, its early development has left no historical traces, and {{it is believed that}} no comparable processes can be observed today. Theories that stress continuity often look at animals to see if, for example, primates display any traits that can be seen as analogous to what pre-human language must <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>like.</b> And early human fossils can be inspected for traces of physical adaptation to language use or pre-linguistic forms of symbolic behaviour. Among the signs in human fossils that may suggest linguistic abilities are: the size of the brain relative to body mass, the presence of a larynx capable of advanced sound production and the nature of tools and other manufactured artifacts.|$|E

25|$|The acidic soil of Dartmoor has {{destroyed}} nearly all organic material; {{it is therefore}} difficult to tell what Grimspound must <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>like</b> during its occupation. A flint arrowhead found nearby, {{and the lack of}} querns for grinding cereals, hint at some dependency on goods from outside the area (flint is not local to Dartmoor). The Exploration Committee also declared that the clay used in pottery fragments did not come from a local source.|$|E

By using a stratagem, Toungoo armies took Pegu without firing a shot. A few weeks later, Hanthawaddy's larger but poorly-led forces were decisively defeated at the Battle of Naungyo by light forces of Gen. Kyawhtin Nawrahta (Bayinnaung). Only a decimated Hanthawaddy force made it to Prome.|$|E

25|$|Geobiology employs {{molecular}} biology, environmental microbiology, chemical analyses, and the geologic {{record to}} investigate the evolutionary interconnectedness of life and Earth. It attempts {{to understand how the}} Earth has changed since the origin of life and what it might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>like</b> along the way. Some definitions of geobiology even push the boundaries of this time frame - to understanding the origin of life and to the role that man has played and will continue to play in shaping the Earth in the Anthropocene.|$|E

25|$|The {{race was}} {{specifically}} given a 1949 theme, with the BBC postulating {{that the race}} might represent what Top Gear would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>like</b> in 1949. That year {{reflects the fact that}} the original 49 Peppercorn Class A1s were built in 1948/9, and accordingly, the bike and car selected were 1949 models. The motorcycle was a Vincent Black Shadow, registration 750 UXL (1952), the car was a Jaguar XK120, registration SKE 7 (1954). According to the show, the XK120 and Black Shadow were the fastest car and bike in the world in 1949. Although Tornado is a brand new locomotive completed in 2008, her design was based on the original 1940s designs used for the LNER Peppercorn Class A1 locomotives, with appropriate modern day changes for engineering, safety, operational and manufacturing cost reasons.|$|E

25|$|In C.L.R. James' autobiographical Beyond a Boundary, the Trinidadian writer {{writes about}} his visits {{as a young}} man to his friend Learie Constantine, at that time living in Nelson while playing as a {{professional}} for the town Lancashire League team. He gives a vivid sense of what it must <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>like</b> for a young West Indian to arrive in the wet and strange East Lancashire. He also describes how his subsequent education at university in Paris is helped by a local baker, and how his gradual politicisation is given a boost by meetings with local socialists, concerned with the harsh treatment and conditions suffered by the local working class millworkers. Although an extreme example, the meetings between other professional cricketers from the British Empire, and the mainly working-class amateurs of the Lancashire League, must have resulted in many other instances of mutual support and understanding.|$|E
25|$|A great celebratory feast is held on Anuenue, {{and plans}} for the future are made. During the party, Xelha and Kalas slip away to the spring in Moonguile Forrest. Xelha reveals that the Ice Queens, of whom she is the last, are {{responsible}} for holding the long-lost Ocean, and that Kalas and the Guardian Spirit must release it from within her, now that the Earth has been restored. Kalas refuses at first, seeing that he has fallen in love with Xelha, but eventually agrees to restore humanity. The Ocean is about to be released when Geldoblame's spirit, inhabiting the surrounding Earth, returns, claiming the new world for himself. Kalas and Xelha defeat him, but the battle uses the last of Xelha's strength and she dies in Kalas' arms. Before her body disappears, she says that she just wished that she and Kalas could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>like</b> any other couple.|$|E
25|$|The Pharisees were a {{powerful}} force in 1st-century Judea. Early Christians shared several beliefs of the Pharisees, such as resurrection, retribution in the next world, angels, human freedom, and Divine Providence. After {{the fall of the}} Temple, the Pharisaic outlook was established in Rabbinic Judaism. Some scholars speculate that Jesus was himself a Pharisee. In Jesus' day, the two main schools of thought among the Pharisees were the House of Hillel, which had been founded by the eminent Tanna, Hillel the Elder, and the House of Shammai. Jesus' assertion of hypocrisy may have been directed against the stricter members of the House of Shammai, although he agreed with their teachings on divorce. Jesus also commented on the House of Hillel's teachings (Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 31a) concerning the greatest commandment and the Golden Rule. Historians do not know whether there were Pharisees in Galilee during Jesus' life, or what they would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>like.</b>|$|E

500|$|As {{the tour}} {{drew to a}} close, U2 entered {{prolonged}} discussions about creating a Zoo TV television channel in partnership with MTV. This never materialised, but in 1997, MTV ran a brief miniseries called Zoo-TV, which featured Emergency Broadcast Network extending their tour role in creating contemporary surrealist satirical video. U2 endorsed the effort as a representation of what the tour would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>like</b> as a news magazine, but their direct role was limited to providing half-financing and outtakes from the Zooropa album. Wired magazine said the series [...] "pushe the edge of commercialâ€”even comprehensibleâ€”television".|$|E
