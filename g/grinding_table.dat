Based on the {{orthogonal}} experiment, {{this paper}} studied {{the influences of}} depth of cut ap, table speed vw and grinding method gm on the two-side direction burr in grinding-hardening machine. The results show that, with thermal-force coupling effect induced in the grinding-hardening machine, the metal in the workpiece’s surface flowed to two-side direction of the workpiece that without any constraint and leaded to the burr’s formation. The depth of cut ap and grinding method gm are significant factors that affected the size of two-side direction burr, and the significant order are as follows: depth of cut ap> <b>grinding</b> method gm> <b>table</b> speed vw>interaction av. With the increasing of depth of cut ap or the grinding trip, the max size of the two-side direction burr increased gradually; and with the raising of table speed vw, the max size decreased firstly and then increased.

There are three grinding roller wheel assemblies in the mill grinding section, which are mounted on a loading frame via pivot point.The fixed-axis roller in each roller wheel assembly rotates on a segmentally-lined <b>grinding</b> <b>table</b> that is supported and driven by a planetary gear reducer direct-coupled to a motor. The grinding force for coal pulverization is applied by a loading frame. This frame is connected by vertical tension rods to three hydraulic cylinders secured to the mill foundation. All forces used in the pulverizing process are transmitted to the foundation via the gear reducer and loading elements. The pendulum movement of the roller wheels provides a freedom for wheels to move in a radial direction, which results in no radial loading against the mill housing during the pulverizing process.|$|E
40|$|An {{innovative}} approach to condition-based maintenance of coal grinding subsystems at thermoelectric power plants is {{proposed in the}} paper. Coal mill grinding tables become worn over time {{and need to be}} replaced through time-based maintenance, after a certain number of service hours. At times such replacement is necessary earlier or later than prescribed, depending {{on the quality of the}} coal and of the <b>grinding</b> <b>table</b> itself. Considerable financial losses are incurred when the entire coal grinding subsystem is shut down and the <b>grinding</b> <b>table</b> found to not actually require replacement. The only way to determine whether replacement is necessary is to shut down and open the entire subsystem for visual inspection. The proposed algorithm supports condition-based maintenance and involves the application of T 2 control charts to distinct acoustic signal parameters in the frequency domain and the construction of Hidden Markov Models whose observations are coded samples from the control charts. In the present research, the acoustic signals were collected by coal mill monitoring at the thermoelectric power plant “Kostolac” in Serbia.

The main differences are 1) the design of the longitudinal bolted joint was simplified and 2) the keys for the flanges are not designed to assist with shear loading. The GDT side windows and PLIF window may be used in the NC facility. 304 SS was chosen for its excellent corrosion resistance. The yield strength is 275 MPa. 304 SS is non-magnetic and is therefore more difficult to <b>grind</b> on a <b>table</b> with magnetic locking. All four plates were blanchard ground (using mechanical locking to the table through some of the bolt holes which were drilled before grinding) by a subcontractor for Hales.

40|$|Releases {{from the}} F and H Area Seepage Basins on the Savannah River Site (SRS) have caused {{groundwater}} plumes that contain {{a variety of}} contaminants. These plumes are releasing contaminants into Fourmile Branch, which is a small tributary of the Savannah River. The metallic contaminant releases to the branch are being controlled by base injection. The base injection targets cationic contaminants and {{was not intended to}} reduce the concentration of I- 129 in groundwater. SRS and the regulatory agencies believe it is appropriate to investigate remedial alternatives that could reduce the I- 129. The Savannah River Site Area Closures Projects (ACP) and the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) are developing an innovative in situ treatment for I- 129 using silver chloride (AgCl). The proposed AgCl amendment has a very small particle size and is designed to be injected into the contaminated aquifer to capture I- 129. The solubility of AgI is several orders of magnitude lower than the solubility of AgCl. Thus, when I- 129 comes in contact with AgCl it forms silver iodide (AgI), which is very stable and essentially insoluble in water. SRNL has been performing bench-scale column tests on the effectiveness of silver chloride to capture iodine in an aqueous solution. These initial tests evaluate silver chloride in four different particle sizes; 4 - 5 millimeters (standard reagent silver chloride), approximately 1 millimeters (sieved reagent silver chloride), approximately 2 micrometers (ultra fine grind without a grinding agent), and < 1 micrometer (ultra fine grind with a grinding agent). The first two experiments with macro-sized particles were proof of principle tests. In these the AgCl was mechanically mixed into a portion of the soil filling the columns. The last two were to test the effectiveness of injecting particles suspended in an aqueous solution [...] the ability to inject the particles, their retention in the column and their effectiveness at removing dissolved iodide from solution. The amendments for these two columns were obtained from a private company specializing in ultra-fine grinding of materials. They were ground in propylene glycol because when ground in water silver metal electroplated onto the steel <b>grinding</b> equipment. <b>Table</b> 1 shows the list of columns and the amendment characteristics. The results of these column experiments demonstrate that solid silver chloride is highly effective at removing dissolved iodine from water and should be an effective amendment for removing I- 129 from groundwater. Based on known groundwater chemistry and the reaction of AgCl with I- to produce AgI, the only interference will be natural dissolved stable iodine (I- 127). Millings et al. (2002) reported a maximum I- 127 concentration of 2. 2 ug/L in groundwater from well P- 27 D, a background water table well near F-Area. The concentration of dissolved iodide used in these experiments is approximately 4500 times this natural concentration. Therefore, a AgCl amendment in the subsurface at the same concentration used in these experiments, might effectively remove I- 129 for up to 4500 times the number of pore volumes of groundwater as observed here. This assumes homogeneous distribution of the amendment and no occlusion by other minerals in the subsurface. The only reliable way to evaluate these effects is by trial in the field. The column studies also suggest that the amendment is readily injectable into sediments, but will not be highly mobile. The fact that the effluent from Column 4 shows no iodide breakthrough after nearly 11 pore volumes indicates that some of the injected AgCl was trapped in the column. A mass balance on iodide reacted so far suggests that a minimum of 0. 056 grams of silver chloride was trapped in the column to react with the iodide. This is 5. 6 % of the mass injected. Assume the 1 -foot column represents the first foot of sediment in the subsurface into which the amendment is injected. If 5. 6 % of the AgCl particles are trapped in each subsequent foot of sediment through which the injectate moves, at 100 feet the concentration of particles will be 3 % of the injection concentration. This is the maximum possible concentration indicated by these column studies, because far more AgCl may have been trapped in the column. Continued data collection will tell how much more. Dissolved silver concentrations from the silver chloride amendment will be low. Effluent from Column 1 was analyzed for dissolved silver and the concentrations were below the detection limit of 0. 2 mg/L...|$|R

The forehead and whole brain are of extraordinary loftiness, and perfectly upright; the nose long, aquiline, and delicately pointed; the mouth fringed with a short silky beard, small and ripe, yet firm as granite, with just pout enough of the lower lip to give hint of that capacity of noble indignation which lay hid under its usual courtly calm and sweetness; if there be a defect in the face, {{it is that the}} eyes are somewhat small, and close together, and the eyebrows, though delicately arched, and, without a trace of peevishness, too closely pressed down upon them, the complexion is dark, the figure tall and graceful; altogether the likeness of a wise and gallant gentleman, lovely to all good men, awful to all bad men; in whose presence none dare say or do a mean or a ribald thing; whom brave men left, feeling themselves nerved to do their duty better, while cowards slipped away, as bats and owls before the sun. So he lived and moved, whether in the Court of Elizabeth, giving his counsel among the wisest; or in the streets of Bideford, capped alike by squire and merchant, shopkeeper and sailor; or riding along the moorland roads between his houses of Stow and Bideford, while every woman ran out to her door to look at the great Sir Richard, the pride of North Devon; or, sitting there in the low mullioned window at Burrough, with his cup of malmsey before him, and the lute to which he had just been singing laid across his knees, while the red western sun streamed in upon his high, bland forehead, and soft curling locks; ever the same steadfast, God-fearing, chivalrous man, conscious (as far as a soul so healthy could be conscious) of the pride of beauty, and strength, and valor, and wisdom, and a race and name which claimed direct descent from the grandfather of the Conqueror, and was tracked down the centuries by valiant deeds and noble benefits to his native shire, himself the noblest of his race. Men said that he was proud; but he could not look round him without having something to be proud of; that he was stern and harsh to his sailors: but it was only when he saw in them any taint of cowardice or falsehood; that he was subject, at moments, to such fearful fits of rage, that he had been seen to snatch the glasses from the <b>table,</b> <b>grind</b> them to pieces in his teeth, and swallow them: but that was only when his indignation had been aroused by some tale of cruelty or oppression, and, above all, by those West Indian devilries of the Spaniards, whom he regarded (and in those days rightly enough) as the enemies of God and man. Of this last fact Oxenham was well aware, and therefore felt somewhat puzzled and nettled, when, after having asked Mr. Leigh's leave to take young Amyas with him and set forth in glowing colors the purpose of his voyage, he found Sir Richard utterly unwilling to help him with his suit.|$|R
