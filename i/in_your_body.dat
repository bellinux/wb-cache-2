Of the experience she said, I {{think a lot of}} females struggle with the way they look, and I wanted to show that everyone's body is different. I think it's a big deal to be an athlete and feel confident <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>body</b> and show it off. I'm not going to say I've never struggled with how I look, but I've reached a point in my life where I'm happy with who I am.|$|E
25|$|When {{different}} {{materials are}} brought {{together and then}} separated, an accumulation of electric charge can occur which leaves one material positively charged while the other becomes negatively charged. The mild shock that you receive when touching a grounded object after walking on carpet {{is an example of}} excess electrical charge accumulating <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>body</b> from frictional charging between your shoes and the carpet. The resulting charge build-up upon your body can generate a strong electrical discharge. Although experimenting with static electricity may be fun, similar sparks create severe hazards in those industries dealing with flammable substances, where a small electrical spark may ignite explosive mixtures with devastating consequences.|$|E

Cells destined to become immune cells, like all blood cells, arise <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>body's</b> bone marrow from stem cells (HSC). A large body of evidence show the transcription factors play critical roles in the homeostasis of T cells, B cells, neutrophils and other non-lymphoid leneages. This review discusses the role of the Smek (Suppressor of mek null) gene, that acts in the stress response pathway of animals by binding to and enhancing the transcription of FoxO transcription factors. Furthermore, the review deals with tachykinins, involved in neurotransmission and immune/hematopoietic modulation.
