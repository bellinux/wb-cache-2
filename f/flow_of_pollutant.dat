50|$|About 150,000 litres {{of diesel}} had already leaked {{out before the}} {{pipeline}} was closed by CNPC. According to Pacific Environment China's co-director Wen Bo, 700 workers were quickly mobilized {{by the government to}} control the spill as soon as its occurrence became known. They dug diversion channels and built floating dams to stop the pollutant from advancing further downstream. Solidifying chemicals were also used to remove the fuel from the stream. Despite these efforts, officials found traces of diesel in the Yellow River on January 4, 2010, 200 km upstream of Zhengzhou. No pollution was detected downstream of Sanmenxia, although the Sanmenxia reservoir was found to contain traces of toxic diesel. Sanmenxia Dam and its six hydroelectric generators were shut down to prevent the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutant</b> further downstream. On 5 January, Zhang Xun, an official of the Ministry of Environmental Protection confirmed that the spill had been contained in the Sanmenxia reservoir and was no longer a threat to the river water downstream.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study an {{endogenous}} growth model with habit-formation and address two questions that are, {{to the best}} of our knowledge, new for the sustainable endogenous growth literature: first, does the process of habit-formation influence the stock of environmental capital? Second, does habit-formation affects the long-term rate of economic growth? Using a simple and standard structure of the endogenous growth models, we first show that there may be multiple equilibria, not all stable. Second, the presence of habits in relation to the consumption goods lowers the long term equilibrium level of natural capital and the growth rate of the economy. Third, we highlight the possibility of "win-win" situations. Finally, we show that the presence of habits reduces the effectiveness of any environmental policy that is meant to improve environmental quality. In particular, the stronger the inertia effect, the lesser will be the equilibrium levels of natural capital and the greater will be the net <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutant</b> emissions. At the same time, the economy will grow at a lower rate. Endogenous Growth, Sustainability, Environmental Preservation, Habit- Formation...|$|E

A new diffusive probe, purposely designed by adapting the diffusive gradient technique method, measures labile organic species by immobilizing them after diffusion through a thin deionized water layer. The measure of the mass accumulated is used to calculate the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutant</b> from solid phase to pore water. Naphthalene was chosen as a model persistent organic pollutant. The probe was calibrated at different temperatures and was then tested in several microcosms at different porosity and reactivities with naphthalene (one clay soil, two sandy soils and one natural soil). The probe response showed good agreement with the expected different abilities of the solid phases in restoring the solution phase. The concentration of naphthalene in the pore water was well buffered by rapid equilibria with the solid phase in the investigated natural soil. In contrast, pore water concentration in the sandy soils decreased rapidly and the flow was slackened, especially for the sandy soil with finer particles.

Yet seldom have the responsible agents {{and their respective}} genes been identified. Here we used field-based stable isotopic probing (SIP) to discover a group of bacteria responsible for in situ metabolism of an environmental pollutant, naphthalene. We released 13 C-labeled naphthalene in a contaminated study site to trace the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutant</b> carbon into the naturally occurring microbial community. Using GC/MS, molecular biology, and classical microbiological techniques we documented 13 CO 2 evolution (2. 3 % of the dose in 8 h), created a library of 16 S rRNA gene clones from 13 C labeled sediment DNA, identified a taxonomic cluster (92 of 95 clones) from the microbial community involved in metabolism of the added naphthalene, and isolated a previously undescribed bacterium (strain CJ 2) from site sediment whose 16 S rRNA gene matched that of the dominant member (48 %) of the clone library. Strain CJ 2 is a β proteobacterium closely related to Polaromonas vacuolata. Moreover, strain CJ 2 hosts the sequence of a naphthalene dioxygenase gene, prevalent in site sediment, detected before only in environmental DNA. This investigative strategy may have general application for elucidating the bases of many biogeochemical processes, hence for advancing knowledge and management of ecological and industrial systems that rely on microorganisms...|$|E
