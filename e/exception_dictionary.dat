5000|$|Some {{rules of}} thumb {{can be found}} in the {{reference}} [...] "On Hyphenation - Anarchy of Pedantry". Among algorithmic approaches to hyphenation, the one implemented in the TeX typesetting system is widely used. It is thoroughly documented in the first two volumes ofComputers and Typesetting and in Frank Liang's dissertation. The aim of Liang's work was to get the algorithm as accurate as he practically could and keep any <b>exception</b> <b>dictionary</b> small. In TeX's original hyphenation patterns for US English, the exception list contains fourteen words.|$|E
5000|$|The {{problem of}} loose lines {{is reduced by}} using hyphenation. With older {{typesetting}} systems and WYSIWYG word processors, this was done manually: the compositor or author added hyphenation on a case-by-case basis. Currently, most typesetting systems (also called layout programs) and modern word processors hyphenate automatically, using a hyphenation algorithm. In addition, professional typesetting programs almost always provide {{for the use of}} an <b>exception</b> <b>dictionary,</b> in part because no algorithm hyphenates all words correctly, and in part because different publishers will follow different dictionaries. Different publishers may also have different rules about permissible hyphenation. Most publishers follow a basic system such as the Chicago Manual of Style or Oxford style, but will overlay their own [...] "house style," [...] which further restricts permissible hyphenation.|$|E
