40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to explore the relationship among the gap between career needs and career <b>development</b> <b>programs,</b> job satisfaction, and turnover intention. First, the nursing career is divided into four stages: exploration stage, establishment stage, maintenance stage, and disengagement stage. We then create scales measuring career needs and career <b>development</b> <b>programs</b> for nurses in each stage. We also use structural equation modeling to test the relationships among the gap between career needs and career <b>development</b> <b>programs,</b> job satisfaction, and turnover intention. The analysis shows that the gap between career needs and career <b>development</b> <b>programs</b> reduces job satisfaction, which indicates that hospitals should pay attention to the career needs of nurses. If career <b>development</b> <b>programs</b> are well planned by hospitals and satisfy the career needs of nurses, nurses will have lower turnover intention, with positive effects to the hospitals. career needs, career <b>development</b> <b>programs,</b> gap, job satisfaction, turnover intention...|$|R
