40|$|Bets are {{a special}} type of game of chance. In a certain sense, {{you could think}} of all games of chance as a bet (bet that the {{roulette}} ball comes to rest in number 7, betting on the correct result in the lottery etc.), but most countries have implemented a categorisation. A categorisation {{that is not only}} under pressure online, but just as much in the real world with the introduction of virtual bets. In Belgium, virtual bets were accepted because bets are highly dependent on events, and players also like to make a bet when no events are taking place. First virtual online betting appeared on the market via the websites of the arcades and the bets, but following a new <b>framework</b> <b>memorandum</b> from the Gaming Commission, it also became a success in the real world. Success that went hand in hand with growing criticism {{in the interests of the}} coherence rules in the area of protecting the player. Although the criticism also partly arose among the betting operators who ran gambling machines in arcades, the discussion about a further restriction on virtual bets showed many similarities with the discussion about the FOBT (fixed odds betting terminals) in the United Kingdom. Betting premises have ease of access and in Belgium a high threshold was introduced for games of chance that were considered more dangerous (e. g. slots, black jack, roulette etc.). Since there is no betting event, the odds are more RNG driven and the playing frequency can be very high, some people are offended that somebody aged 20 may not enter arcade, but he may, without any embarrassment, wager large sums on virtual betting events. In response to the rule applied by the Gaming Commission not to allow people under the age of 21 to make virtual bets on a betting website. In Belgium, bets can be placed in a newspaper shop (sport bets up to 200 euro per day per person), in a mobile betting office (bets linked to the event for which the mobile licence has been obtained) and in a betting shop (no limit to the number of bets or wagers, but for wagers above 1000 euro, a complete identification and registration of the player and the bet must be made). Bets on virtual (sport) events can only be accepted in betting shops and not in newspaper shops or via mobile betting offices. In summary, virtual betting is permitted in Belgium, but there are constricting provisions in force. The online virtual bets are placed on the same level of protection as slot machines, unlike the virtual bets in the real world, which are accessible from the age of 18, but can only be operated in a limited manner. Further restrictions, including even a prohibition for betting offices to operate virtual bets, also remain a possibility, if the virtual bets evolve further into a game of chance with high playing frequently whereby the event is in practice no longer of no significance and no sufficient protection of the player can be guaranteed...|$|E

40|$|CTA in {{collaboration}} with the Southern African Centre for Cooperation in Agricultural Research (SACCAR) have just published a comprehensive bibliography of agricultural development in Angola. This is the first of a 9 -volume series that will cover the nine countries of the SADCC region (Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe). The publication of the bibliographies is one of the collaborative activities within the <b>framework</b> of a <b>memorandum</b> of understanding signed between CTA and SACCAR in Gaborone, Botswana, in 1988 (see Spore 25, P. 9). SACCAR was set up at Gaborone in 1984 to provide a centre for the promotion of regional cooperation in agricultural research and the development of research manpower and training. Among its outstanding achievements is the compilation of an inventory of agricultural research training and extension institutions. A result of this is the Agricultural Research Resource Assessment (ARRA) database which contains agricultural potentials, statistical and ecological information on the SADCC countries, including information on current research. Information on past research efforts was, however, lacking and this is to be filled by this series of bibliographies. Three more volumes are expected to be published this year. The remaining 5 will be published in 1991.

40|$|FP 7 FRAME project, Deliverable No. 5. 2 This report {{presents}} {{the outcome of}} the analysis and critical assessment of EU human rights engagement with other European regional organisations. Cooperation between the European Union and the Council of Europe has become more systematic, in particular in the <b>framework</b> of the <b>Memorandum</b> of Understanding signed in 2007. This document inter alia identifies shared priorities and focal areas of cooperation among which are listed human rights and fundamental freedoms; rule of law and legal co-operation; democracy and good governance; democratic stability; intercultural dialogue and cultural diversity; education, youth and promotion of human contacts; and social cohesion. In the light of the Lisbon Treaty, including the new legal status of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the commitment to ratify the European Convention on Human Rights, cooperation between the EU and the system of human rights protection established within the CoE should be significantly enhanced. However, the road leading up to the accession to the European Convention may be more difficult than expected as has been indicated by the Opinion 2 / 13 of the CJEU on the Draft Accession Agreement, adopted on 18 December 2014. In the case of the OSCE, although the role of the EU has never been formally defined in details, the EU participation in the work of OSCE bodies has been recognized by the established practice and formalised by the Rules of Procedure of the organisation adopted in 2006. The EU attaches particular importance to co-operation with the OSCE on security-related matters and conflict prevention in Europe. nrpages: 233 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} century, {{different}} energy and raw material sectors, {{as well as}} countries, adopted a range of approaches to classify and manage resources. New challenges to the production, distribution and utilization of energy and raw materials have, however, emerged {{in recent years that}} demand innovative approaches for an integrated resource management system. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development defines a clear pathway to address these challenges in a holistic manner. The United Nations Framework Classification for Resources (UNFC) was developed {{under the auspices of the}} United Nations Economic Commission for Europe by a dedicated community of experts drawn from a range of fields, but with the common goal to develop an internationally applicable scheme for the classification, reporting and management of energy and mineral resources. Though initially developed for the mineral and petroleum sectors, UNFC has recently expanded its scope to include renewable energy. Growing awareness and interest in renewable energy resources, including geothermal resources, has highlighted a need to standardize the way in which renewable energy potential is classified and reported. To facilitate improved global communication in the geothermal sector, the ECE Expert Group on Resource Classification, under the <b>framework</b> of a <b>Memorandum</b> of Understanding between the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe and the International Geothermal Association (IGA), developed specifications for applying UNFC to geothermal energy resources. The specifications were issued in September 2016. A set of 14 case studies from Australia, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Philippines and Russian Federation are presented here to facilitate a better understanding of the specifications and the uniform application of UNFC to geothermal resources. These application examples illustrate the classification of a range of different geothermal resource scenarios in a manner consistent with other energy resources. The approach also provides valuable indicators to the value of UNFC as a tool to support attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals. Experts in geothermal energy resources, as well as those in other energy and mineral sectors, will find this collection of case studies a useful reference document in their efforts to apply a globally applicable integrated resource management system. I commend all those involved in the preparation, review and verification of these case studies and thank, in particular, the International Geothermal Association for its support...|$|R
