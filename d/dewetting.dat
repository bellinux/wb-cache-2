40|$|International audienceDue {{to large}} scale {{applications}} the crystal growth technology of gallium arsenide has made considerable progress {{but there is}} still a need for improving the crystal size and quality. The study of practical stability of GaAs crystals that could be grown by the <b>dewetted</b> Bridgman process [1] is presented. According to the analytical and numerical investigations of the dynamic stability of the <b>dewetted</b> Bridgman process reported in [2 - 3], a range of acceptable maximal and minimal crystal radius is given and fluctuations of the gas pressure are introduced in the system. It is shown that only certain frequencies and amplitudes of these fluctuations lead to stable growth {{in the case of a}} globally convex meniscus (theta(c) + alpha(e) >= 180 degrees). When theta(c) + alpha(e) < 180 degrees the growth is always unstable. Examples of stable and unstable growth are given for the case of industrial production...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{experiments}} on chemically homogeneous polymer melt-brush systems have found large deviations from theory. By using X-ray reflectivity and atomic force microscopy, {{we find that}} the equilibrium structure of these systems is complex, composed of <b>dewetted</b> droplets of the constituent polymers residing on a residual film of the end-grafted brush swollen by the free melt chains. When the molecular weight of the melt or the grafting density of the brush is decreased, the thickness of the residual film increases and the contact angle decreases, both indicating improved wettability. At the same time, the profile of the <b>dewetted</b> droplets exhibits a progressively longer and gentler tail at the ends. But a wetting-dewetting transition is never observed. By comparing the measurements to recent results of the self-consistent field theory, good quantitative agreement is found. On the other hand, Leibler's analytical theory-which has been used almost exclusively for comparison with experiment-provides a poor description...|$|R

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. June 2009. Major: Material Science and Engineering. Advisor: Prof. C. Barry Carter. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xviii, 282 pages, appendices. Ill. (some col.) The work presented here is concentrated on surfaces and interfaces in alumina (Al 2 O 3), anorthite (CaAl 2 Si 2 O 8), silica (SiO 2) and rutile (TiO 2). While {{each of these}} materials have different crystal structures and measurable properties, they all exhibit similar mechanisms for fundamental behavior. The topics researched and discussed lead into each other. Faceting describes the movement of atoms to a lower energy configuration. While faceting of the surface is only considered, grain boundaries can be faceted. In cross-section, facets resemble grain boundary grooves. Grooves and ridges form where a grain boundary intersects {{the surface of a}} material. The grooves facilitate grain boundary migration and diffusion. The surface tension at the groove is governed by Young's equation, which balances the interfacial forces between the solid and vapor. Glass films can wet or <b>dewet</b> the surface a grain boundaries. Whether the film wets or <b>dewets</b> depends on the surface energy of the surface and the liquid. Capillary forces determine the type of <b>dewet</b> patterns formed on the surface. Again, the surface-vapor-liquid interfaces are governed by Young's equation. Liquid films at grain boundaries facilitate densification and grain boundary migration. Liquid phase sintering (LPS) uses capillary forces and the dissolution/reprecipitation process to sinter green compacts to a high density at lower temperatures. Capillary forces and surface tension can also cause the liquid film to penetrate or exude from the grain boundary. Various forms of microscopy have been used to characterize and relate these phenomena...|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{it can be}} seen that highest {{adhesion}} would be given by the formulation containing purely defoamer (Formulation H). The defoamer causes foam destabilization and breaking via bridging-dewetting mechanism, where a solid particle comes in contact with and bridges opposite surfaces of the foam film. If the particle is sufficiently hydrophobic, it is <b>dewetted</b> by the liquid and perforates the foam film, leading to foam rupture [17] and improved adhesion of the ink film surface during printing.|$|R

5000|$|In most <b>dewetting</b> studies a thin {{polymer film}} is spun onto a substrate. Even {{in the case}} of [...] the film does not dewet {{immediately}} if it is in a metastable state, e.g. if the temperature is below the glass transition temperature of the polymer.

5000|$|In fluid mechanics, <b>dewetting</b> {{is one of}} the {{processes}} that can occur at a solid-liquid or liquid-liquid interface. Generally, <b>dewetting</b> describes the rupture of a thin liquid film on the substrate (either a liquid itself, or a solid) and the formation of droplets. The opposite process—spreading of a liquid on a substrate—is called wetting. The factor determining the spontaneous spreading and <b>dewetting</b> for a drop of oil placed on a liquid substrate (water here) with ambient gas, is the so-called spreading coefficient :where [...] is the gas-water surface tension, [...] is the gas-oil surface tension and [...] is the oil water surface tension (measured on the fluids before they are brought in contact with each other) ...|$|E

50|$|The {{phenomenon}} of cellular <b>dewetting</b> {{can be interpreted}} by physical modeling (Figure 2). The driving force responsible for the spontaneous formation of TEM tunnels and their opening is the membrane tension that results from the spreading of cells due to actomyosin relaxation. Opposite to liquid <b>dewetting,</b> TEMs reach a maximum diameter, at which the driving force is balanced by a resisting force that develops along TEM edges (Figure 2). This resisting force {{is referred to as}} line tension and is uncharacterized at the molecular level.|$|E

Single-layer graphene is formed through surface catalytic decomposition of hydrocarbon precursors on thin copper films predeposited on dielectric substrates.

40|$|Reactions between {{thin films}} of CA 2 and (0001) -oriented a-Al 2 O 3 {{have been studied}} using a {{combination}} of microscopy techniques. Thin films of amorphous CA 2 were deposited on sapphire substrates by pulsed-laser deposition at 900 °C in an oxygen ambient atmosphere. The reaction couples were heat treated in air either at 1300 °C or 1400 °C for various times after deposition. Atomic-force microscopy was used to monitor changes in the microstructure of the films. Interfaces between the different regions were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of cross-sectional samples prepared by focused ion-beam. The CA 2 films had <b>dewetted</b> the substrate surface {{as a result of the}} heat treatment. An interfacial reaction layer was observed between the <b>dewetted</b> CA 2 droplets and the substrate. The structure of this reaction layer was found to be consistent with g-Al 2 O 3 by analysis of high-resolution TEM images. There is a perfect epitaxy between the interfacial layer and the substrate. For the samples heat treated for longer times, hexagonal features were found on the substrate surface. The presence of these features on (0001) -oriented a-Al 2 O 3 suggests the formation of CA 6 platelets by the transformation of the interfacial reaction layer.
