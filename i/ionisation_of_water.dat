40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{analysis}} of the influence of environment on the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of carbon ions on molecular level. Due to the high relevance of RBE for medical applications, such as tumor therapy, and radiation protection in space, DNA damages have been investigated {{in order to understand the}} biological efficiency of heavy ion radiation. The contribution of this study to the radiobiology research consists in the analysis of plasmid DNA damages induced by carbon ion radiation in biochemical buffer environments, as well as in the calculation of the RBE of carbon ions on DNA level by mean of scanning force microscopy (SFM). In order to study the DNA damages, besides the common electrophoresis method, a new approach has been developed by using SFM. The latter method allows direct visualisation and measurement of individual DNA fragments with an accuracy of several nanometres. In addition, comparison of the results obtained by SFM and agarose gel electrophoresis methods has been performed in the present study. Sparsely ionising radiation, such as X-rays, and densely ionising radiation, such as carbon ions, have been used to irradiate plasmid DNA in trishydroxymethylaminomethane (Tris buffer) and 4 -(2 -hydroxyethyl) - 1 -piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES buffer) environments. These buffer environments exhibit different scavenging capacities for hydroxyl radical (HO 0), which is produced by <b>ionisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and plays the major role in the indirect DNA damage processes. Fragment distributions have been measured by SFM over a large length range, and as expected, a significantly higher degree of DNA damages was observed for increasing dose. Also a higher amount of double-strand breaks (DSBs) was observed after irradiation with carbon ions compared to X-ray irradiation. The results obtained from SFM measurements show that both types of radiation induce multiple fragmentation of the plasmid DNA in the dose range from D = 250 Gy to D = 1500 Gy. Using Tris environments at two different concentrations, a decrease of the relative biological effectiveness with the rise of Tris concentration was observed. This demonstrates the radioprotective behavior of the Tris buffer solution. In contrast, a lower scavenging capacity for all other free radicals and ions, produced by the <b>ionisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> was registered in the case of HEPES buffer compared to Tris solution. This is reflected in the higher RBE values deduced from SFM and gel electrophoresis measurements after irradiation of the plasmid DNA in 20 mM HEPES environment compared to 92 mM Tris solution. These results show that HEPES and Tris environments play a major role on preventing the indirect DNA damages induced by ionising radiation and on the relative biological effectiveness of heavy ion radiation. In general, the RBE calculated from the SFM measurements presents higher values compared to gel electrophoresis data, for plasmids irradiated in all environments. Using a large set of data, obtained from the SFM measurements, it was possible to calculate the survive rate over a larger range, from 88 % to 98 %, while for gel electrophoresis measurements the survive rates have been calculated only for values between 96 % and 99 %. While the gel electrophoresis measurements provide information only about the percentage of plasmids DNA that suffered a single DSB, SFM can count the small plasmid fragments produced by multiple DSBs induced in a single plasmid. Consequently, SFM generates more detailed information regarding the amount of the induced DSBs compared to gel electrophoresis, and therefore, RBE can be calculated with more accuracy. Thus, SFM has been proven to be a more precise method to characterize on molecular level the DNA damage induced by ionizing radiations. GSI und DAA...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Many {{well-documented}} {{biochemical processes}} lack a molecular mechanism. Examples are: how ATP hydrolysis and an enzyme contrive to perform work, such as active transport; how peptides are formed from amino acids and DNA from nucleotides; how proteases cleave peptide bonds, how bone mineralses; how enzymes distinguish between sodium and potassium; how chirality of biopolymers was established prebiotically. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: It is shown that involvement {{of water in}} all these processes is mandatory, but the water must be of the simplified configuration {{in which there are}} only two strengths of water-water hydrogen bonds, and in which these two types of water coexist as microdomains throughout the liquid temperature range. Since they have different strengths of hydrogen bonds, the microdomains differ in all their physical and chemical properties. Solutes partition asymmetrically, generating osmotic pressure gradients which must be compensated for or abolished. Displacement of the equilibrium between high and low density waters incurs a thermodynamic cost which limits solubility, depresses <b>ionisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> drives protein folding and prevents high density water from boiling at its intrinsic boiling point which appears to be below 0 degrees C. Active processes in biochemistry take place in sequential partial reactions, most of which release small amounts of free energy as heat. This ensures that the system is never far from equilibrium so that efficiency is extremely high. Energy transduction is neither possible and nor necessary. Chirality was probably established in prebiotic clays which must have carried stable populations of high density and low density water domains. Bioactive enantiomorphs partition into low density water in which they polymerise spontaneously. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The simplified model of water has great explanatory power...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} gamma-radiation-induced DNA strand breaks have been {{investigated}} using two systems: a plasmid-based assay, and a whole nuclei-, or whole cell-based, alkaline filter elution assay. Addition of alkali metal halides to DNA irradiated under frozen aqueous conditions were observed {{to have an effect}} on the radiosensitivity of the DNA. This, effect, which was not observed with DNA irradiated under fluid aqueous conditions, would appear to be due to two components; a physical component, and a chemical component which is dependent on the anions used. Addition of alkali metal halides appears to increase the volume of the hydrating layer <b>of</b> <b>water</b> which is formed around the DNA when it is frozen. This appears to increase the target volume when it is irradiated, with an observed increase in damage caused by H 2 O-+ and non-hydrated electrons from the <b>ionisation</b> <b>of</b> the hydration <b>water.</b> The chemical component, which may be a protective or a sensitising effect, is dependent on the anion in the system. The scavenging of electrons produced from the direct action of gamma radiation on DNA has been demonstrated using the intercalator, mitozantrone. This was demonstrated using plasmid DNA irradiated under frozen aqueous solutions, and compared with the e. s. r. spectroscopy results obtained by my coworkers. Finally, the protection of DNA by free-thiols has been investigated. Under indirect, dilute aqueous conditions, the amount of protection to plasmid DNA was observed to increase with increasing positive charge on the thiols. Under direct, frozen aqueous conditions, the radiosensitivity of plasmid DNA by the compounds used was less clear cut. Possible reasons for this contrast are discussed. The effect of a novel aminothiol with a + 3 positive charge on the amount of damage to tissue culture cells was also investigated...|$|R

Kinematically complete experiments, where the momentum balance of all involved particles is measured, provide the most stringent test of theoretical models. In such experiments, surprising discrepancies between theory and experiment were found in the collision-induced <b>ionisation</b> <b>of</b> helium. In this work, a novel experimental technique, a so-called MOTReMi, consisting of a reaction microscope (ReMi) in combination with a magneto-optical trap (MOT), was assembled and could improve the recoil-ion momentum resolution compared of previous experiments by a factor of 2 - 3.

30|$|Another {{possibility}} for doping {{is that the}} matrix material, rather than the QDs, is doped by the impurity atoms and that this then provides free carriers which are captured by the QDs.
