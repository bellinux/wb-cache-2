Traffic reduction was added to by: the 1969 closure of the CWS Irlam soap works; post nationalisation British Steel Corporation building their own line to Glazebrook to junction with BR; and severe reductions in traffic of ICI's soda ash trains, British Tar Products and reduced <b>domestic</b> <b>coal</b> consumption. With the remaining engines stationed at Ellesmere Port and Stanlow, maintenance {{on the line from}} Irlam through to Partington was halted in late summer 1977, and all through traffic except engineering trains stopped on 21 December 1977. The through line was officially closed to all traffic in 1978, but many of the sidings complexes remained; the last operational section of the MSC Railway, at Trafford Park, closed on 30 April 2009.|$|E

40|$|The Nation {{today is}} faced with a serious energy problem. Domestic {{production}} of petroleum has been declining in recent years, while {{our dependence on foreign}} oil has been increasing. We continue to be vulnerable to interruptions in the supply of foreign oil similar to that which occurred in 1973. In addition to nuclear power, our principal alternative to oil, at least for the near term, is coal.

25|$|In China, {{due to an}} {{increasing}} need for liquid energy in the transportation sector, coal liquefaction projects were given high priority even during periods of oil prices below $40 per barrel. This is probably because China prefers not {{to be dependent on}} foreign oil, instead utilizing its enormous <b>domestic</b> <b>coal</b> reserves. As oil prices were increasing {{during the first half of}} 2009, the coal liquefaction projects in China were again boosted, and these projects are profitable with an oil barrel price of $40.|$|E
25|$|One {{rationale}} for ethanol {{production in the}} U.S. is increased energy security, from shifting supply from oil imports to domestic sources. Ethanol production requires significant energy, and current U.S. production derives most of that energy from <b>domestic</b> <b>coal,</b> natural gas and other non-oil sources. Because in 2006, 66% of U.S. oil consumption was imported, compared to a net surplus of coal and just 16% of natural gas (2006 figures), the displacement of oil-based fuels to ethanol produced a net shift from foreign to domestic U.S. energy sources.|$|E
40|$|Based on {{investigations}} of ash deposit formation, semi-empirical indicators for slagging and fouling, based on ash chemical composition and its fusion temperature, have been determined. These criteria-indicators, in suggested limits, describe the coals {{on which they}} are based (North-American and British) well. However, the experience in the thermal power production sector of Serbia shows that their literal application to <b>domestic</b> <b>coals</b> does not produce satisfactory results. This contribution provides an analysis of applicability and the choice of criteria that are suitable for Serbian coals. The focus of the contribution is on coal slagging indicators, since slagging has much heavier consequences on heat transfer inside the steam boiler, and on boiler operation as a whole.

25|$|If {{energy for}} {{hydrogen}} production were available (from wind, solar, fission or fusion nuclear power etc.), {{use of the}} substance for hydrocarbon synfuel production could expand captive use of hydrogen {{by a factor of}} 5 to 10. Present U.S. use of hydrogen for hydrocracking is roughly 4Mt per year. It is estimated that 37.7Mt/yr of hydrogen would be sufficient to convert enough <b>domestic</b> <b>coal</b> to liquid fuels to end U.S. dependence on foreign oil importation, and less than half this figure to end dependence on Middle East oil. Coal liquefaction would present significantly worse emissions of carbon dioxide than does the current system of burning fossil petroleum, but it would eliminate the political and economic vulnerabilities inherent in US oil importation before the commercialization of tight oil in North America.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} {{cultural}} investments {{were carried out}} in 1958: the newspaper Det nye Kingsbay was published, a public library was established and the school {{moved to a new}} building. By 1959 Ester I was depleted and the railway was closed—transport having been taken over by trucks. That year only 8,000 tonnes were exported. A new shaft was opened the following year, allowing mining to start in Vestre Senterfelt. Production in 1960 hit a record 79,000 tonnes of raw coal, which after being processed through the new coal preparation plant resulted in 51,000 tonnes. Start of a coke plant in Mo i Rana helped stimulate the <b>domestic</b> <b>coal</b> demand. Washed coal production hit 54,000 tonnes in 1961. By then NOK21 million had been invested in the past years, although the coal prices had continued to fall, and especially in Norway the demand had diminished. Norway was retiring its last steam locomotives, but unlike in most of Europe it was not replicating the coal demand through construction of coal-fueled thermal power plants. By 1962 Ny-Ålesund had 25 family apartments and barracks for 210 male employees. Production hit 75,000 tonnes of washed coal in 1962.|$|E
50|$|Still {{another source}} of fuel in the 1980s was firewood. Although Bhutanese had greater access to {{electric}} power than they had had previously, traditional methods of cooking and heating required readily available fuel. In the mid-1980s, Bhutan produced a coal equivalent of 982,000 tons of fuelwood per year to meet <b>domestic</b> needs. <b>Coal</b> itself was available in reserve in some 1.3 million tons, but recovery was difficult and the quality was poor.|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} {{co-firing}} is quite simple. It consists {{in the use}} of two or more fuels inside the same combustion device.

2500|$|The {{cold weather}} {{preceding}} {{and during the}} Great Smog led Londoners to burn more coal than usual to keep warm. Post-war <b>domestic</b> <b>coal</b> tended to be of a relatively low-grade, sulphurous variety (economic necessity meant that better-quality [...] "hard" [...] coals tended to be exported), which increased the amount of sulphur dioxide in the smoke. There were also numerous coal-fired power stations in the Greater London area, including Fulham, Battersea, Bankside, Greenwich and Kingston upon Thames, all of which added to the pollution. According to the UK's Met Office, the following pollutants were emitted each day during the smoggy period: 1,000 tonnes of smoke particles, 140 tonnes of hydrochloric acid, 14 tonnes of fluorine compounds, and 370 tonnes of sulphur dioxide {{which may have been}} converted to 800 tonnes of sulphuric acid.|$|E

40|$|In {{investigating}} {{the effect of}} biogenic gas production on the recovery of coalbed methane (CBM), coal samples spanning different ranks were applied in the microbial-functioned simulation experiments for biogenic methane production. Based on the biogenic methane yield, testing of pore structures, and the isothermal adsorption data of coals used {{before and after the}} simulation experiments, several key parameters related to the recovery of CBM, including recovery rate, gas saturation and ratio of critical desorption pressure to reservoir pressure, etc., were calculated and the corresponding variations were further analyzed. The results show that one of the significant functions of microbial communities on coal is possibly to weaken its affinity for methane gas, especially with the advance of coal ranks; and that by enhancing the pore system of coal, which can be evidenced by the increase of porosity and permeability, the samples collected from Qianqiu (Yima in Henan) and Shaqu (Liulin in Shanxi) coal mines all see a notable increase in the critical desorption pressure, gas saturation and recovery rate, as compared to the moderate changes of that of Guandi (Xishan in Shanxi) coal sample. It is concluded that the significance of enhanced biogenic gas is not only in the increase of CBM resources and the improvement of CBM recoverability, but in serving as an engineering reference for <b>domestic</b> <b>coalbed</b> biogenic gas production...|$|R
