The hydrolysis of hafnium was investigated by potentiometric titration in solutions of varying ionic strength to determine the stability constants {{for the first four}} monomeric hydrolysis products. The specific ion interaction theory is used to extrapolate these results to infinite dilution. The solubility of hafnium hydroxide and a meta-stable hafnium carbonate solid phase are studied via solubility experiments using ICP-AES. An upper bound for the stability constant of the first carbonate complex is determined. The solubility of hafnium oxide is investigated via solubility experiments using neutron activation analysis, which is also used to investigate the complexation of hafnium by silicates. (cont.)

The principal fissile materials subject to this disposition activity are plutonium and uranium containing substantial fractions of plutonium- 239 uranium- 235. The data in this report, prepared as technical input to the fissile material disposition Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) deal only with the <b>disposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>plutonium</b> that contains well over 80 % plutonium- 239.

One of the options for disposition of weapon-grade plutonium being considered is the power reactor alternative. Plutonium would be fabricated into mixed oxide (MOX) fuel and fissioned (``burned``) in a reactor to produce electric power. The MOX fuel will contain dioxides of uranium and plutonium with less than 7 % weapon-grade plutonium and uranium that has about 0. 2 % uranium- 235.

Both immobilization and reactor-based mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel technologies are being evaluated. The reactor-based MOX fuel option requires assessment of {{the potential impact of}} concentrations of gallium (on the order of 1 to 10 ppm), not present in conventional MOX fuel, on cladding material performance. An experimental program was designed to evaluate the performance of prototypic Zircaloy cladding materials against (1) liquid gallium, and (2) various concentrations of G~ 03. Three types of tests were performed: (1) corrosion, (2) liquid metal embrittlement, and (3) corrosion-mechanical. These tests were to determine corrosion mechanisms, thresholds for temperature and concentration of gallium that delineate behavioral regimes, and changes in the mechanical properties of Zircaloy. Results have generally been favorable for the use of weapons-grade (WG) MOX fhel. The Zircaloy cladding does react with gallium to form intermetallic compounds at > 3000 C; however, this reaction is limited by the mass of gallium and is therefore not expected to be significant with a low level (parts per million) of gallium in the MOX fuel. Furthermore, no evidence for grain boundary penetration by gallium or liquid metal embrittlement was observed...|$|E

The criteria that has been established to assure the safety of stored materials for a minimum of 50 years is DOE-STD- 3013. Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) has designed a containment package in accordance with the DOE standard. The package consists of an optional convenience (food pack) can, a welded type 304 L stainless steel inner (primary) can, and a welded type 304 L stainless steel outer (secondary) can. With or without the food pack can, the material is placed inside the primary can and welded shut under a helium atmosphere. This activity takes place totally within the confinement of the glove box line. Following the welding process, the can is checked for leaks and then sent down the line for decontamination. Once decontaminated, the sealed primary can may be removed from the glove box line. Welding of the secondary container takes place outside the glove box line. The highly automated decontamination process that has been developed to support the packaging of Special Nuclear Materials is based on an electrolytic process similar to the wide spread industrial technique of electropolishing. The can is placed within a specially designed stainless steel fixture built within a partition of a glove box. This fixture is then filled with a flowing electrolyte solution. A low DC electric current is made to flow between the can, acting as the anode, and the fixture, acting as the cathode. Following the decontamination, the system provides a flow of rinse water through the fixture to rinse the can of remaining salt residues. The system then carried out a drying cycle.

40|$|The <b>disposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>plutonium</b> from {{decommissioned}} nuclear weapons, by {{incorporation into}} commercial UO{sub 2 }-based nuclear reactor fuel, {{is a viable}} means to reduce the potential for theft of excess plutonium. This fuel, {{which would be a}} combination of plutonium oxide and uranium oxide, is referred to as a mixed oxide (MOX). Following power generation in commercial reactors with this fuel, the remaining plutonium would become mixed with highly radioactive fission products in a spent fuel assembly. The radioactivity, complex chemical composition, and large size of this spent fuel assembly, would make theft difficult with elaborate chemical processing required for plutonium recovery. In fabricating the MOX fuel, it is important to maintain current commercial fuel purity specifications. While impurities from the weapons plutonium {{may or may not have}} a detrimental affect on the fuel fabrication or fuel/cladding performance, certifying the effect as insignificant could be more costly than purification. Two primary concerns have been raised with regard to the gallium impurity: (1) gallium vaporization during fuel sintering may adversely affect the MOX fuel fabrication process, and (2) gallium vaporization during reactor operation may adversely affect the fuel cladding performance. Consequently, processes for the separation of plutonium from gallium are currently being developed and/or designed. In particular, two separation processes are being considered: (1) a developmental, potentially lower cost and lower waste, thermal vaporization process following PuO{sub 2 } powder preparation, and (2) an off-the-shelf, potentially higher cost and higher waste, aqueous-based ion exchange (IX) process. While it is planned to use the thermal vaporization process should its development prove successful, IX has been recommended as a backup process. This report presents a preconceptual design with material balances for separation of plutonium from gallium by IX...|$|E

40|$|The American Nuclear Society (ANS) endorses {{the rapid}} {{application}} <b>of</b> mixed uranium <b>plutonium</b> oxide (MOX) fuel technology {{to accomplish the}} timely <b>disposition</b> <b>of</b> surplus weapons-grade <b>plutonium.</b> The end <b>of</b> the Cold War has led to universal recognition that both the United States and Russia possess stockpiles <b>of</b> weapons-grade <b>plutonium</b> that far exceed their defense requirements. In 1994 the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) stated the following: “The existence of this material [surplus weapons-usable plutonium and highly enriched uranium] constitutes {{a clear and present}} danger to national and international security. 1 Russia and the United States have held extensive discussions on plutonium disposition, culminating in a September 2000 agreement 2 to dispose of 34 metric tons of surplus weapons grade plutonium in each country.

40|$|The recent {{decision}} by the Department of Energy to pursue a hybrid option for the <b>disposition</b> <b>of</b> weapons <b>plutonium</b> has created {{the need for additional}} facilities that can examine and characterize waste forms that contain Pu. This hybrid option consists of the placement <b>of</b> <b>plutonium</b> into stable waste forms and also into mixed oxide fuel for commercial reactors. Glass and glass-ceramic waste forms {{have a long history of}} being effective hosts for containing radionuclides, including <b>plutonium.</b> The types <b>of</b> tests necessary to characterize the performance of candidate waste forms include: static leaching experiments on both monolithic and crushed waste forms, microscopic examination, and density determination. Frequently, the respective candidate waste forms must first be produced using elevated temperatures and/or high pressures. The desired operations in the glovebox include, but are not limited to the following: (1) production of vitrified/sintered samples, (2) sampling of glass from crucibles or other vessels, (3) preparing samples for microscopic inspection and monolithic and crushed static leach tests, and (4) performing and analyzing leach tests in situ. This paper will describe the essential equipment and modifications that are necessary to successfully accomplish the goal of outfitting a glovebox for these functions...|$|R
