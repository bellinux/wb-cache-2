5|$|Speaking at {{the string}} theory {{conference at the}} University of Southern California in 1995, Edward Witten of the Institute for Advanced Study made the {{surprising}} suggestion that all five superstring theories were in fact just different limiting cases of a single theory in eleven spacetime dimensions. Witten's announcement drew together all of the previous results on S- and T-duality {{and the appearance of}} two- and five-dimensional branes in string theory. In the months following Witten's announcement, <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> papers appeared on the Internet confirming that the new theory involved membranes in an important way. Today this flurry of work is known as the second superstring revolution.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} of Georgian {{architecture}} (about 1720–1840) the main architects and builders working in Bristol were James Bridges, John Wallis, and Thomas Paty with his sons John and William Paty. They put up <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> buildings, reflecting the increased prosperity {{that came with the}} new Floating Harbour and trade based at The Exchange, built in 1741–43 by John Wood the Elder. Their early work included the Royal Fort, Blaise Castle House and Arno's Court estate, with the associated Arno's Court Triumphal Arch and Black Castle Public House. More modest terraces and squares grew up in the new suburbs such as Hotwells and north into Clifton, including 7 Great George Street, now the Georgian House Museum. It was built around 1790 for John Pinney a successful sugar merchant, and {{is believed to be the}} house where the poets William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge first met. It was also home to Pinney's slave, Pero, after whom Pero's Bridge at Bristol Harbour is named.|$|E

The satellite provides a constant view of the immediate solar vicinity, and SOHO has now discovered <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> Sun-grazing comets, some just a few metres across. About 83% of the sungrazers found by SOHO are members of the Kreutz group, with the other being referred to as 'non-Kreutz' or 'sporadic' sungrazers (Meyer, Marsden, and Kracht1&2 families). On average, a new member of the Kreutz family is discovered every three days. Apart from Comet Lovejoy, none of the sungrazers seen by SOHO has survived its perihelion passage; some may have plunged into the Sun itself, but most are likely to have simply evaporated away completely.|$|E

5|$|Although the Norman {{invasion}} {{caused some}} damage as soldiers looted {{the countryside and}} land was confiscated for castle building, the English economy was not greatly affected. Taxes were increased, however, and the Normans established extensive forests that were exploited for their natural resources and protected by royal laws. The next two centuries saw huge growth in the English economy, driven {{in part by the}} increase in the population from around 1.5million in 1086 to between 4and 5million in 1300. More land, much of it {{at the expense of the}} royal forests, was brought into production to feed the growing population and to produce wool for export to Europe. Many <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> towns, some of them planned communities, were built across England, supporting the creation of guilds, charter fairs and other medieval institutions which governed the growing trade. Jewish financiers played a significant role in funding the growing economy, along with the new Cistercian and Augustinian religious orders that emerged as major players in the wool trade of the north. Mining increased in England, with a silver boom in the 12th century helping to fuel the expansion of the money supply.|$|E
5|$|The 12th and 13th centuries saw a huge {{development}} of the English economy. This was partially driven by {{the growth in the}} population from around 1.5million {{at the time of the}} creation of the Domesday Book in 1086 to between 4and 5million in 1300. England remained a primarily agricultural economy, with the rights of major landowners and the duties of serfs increasingly enshrined in English law.

Many <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> towns, some of them planned, sprung up across England, supporting the creation of guilds, charter fairs and other important medieval institutions.

5|$|The {{quality of}} life was {{improved}} with many Han inventions. The Han Chinese had hempen-bound bamboo scrolls to write on, yet by the 2nd century AD had invented the papermaking process which created a writing medium that was both cheap and easy to produce. The invention of the wheelbarrow aided in the hauling of heavy loads. The maritime junk ship and stern-mounted steering rudder enabled the Chinese to venture out of calmer waters of interior lakes and rivers and into the open sea. The invention of the grid reference for maps and raised-relief map allowed the Chinese to better navigate their terrain. In medicine, they used new herbal remedies to cure illnesses, calisthenics to keep physically fit, and regulated diets to avoid diseases. Authorities in the capital were warned ahead of time of the direction of sudden earthquakes with {{the invention of the}} seismometer that was tripped by a vibration-sensitive pendulum device. To mark the passing of the seasons and special occasions, the Han Chinese used two variations of the lunisolar calendar, which were established due to efforts in astronomy and mathematics. Han-era Chinese advancements in mathematics include the discovery of square roots, cube roots, the Pythagorean theorem, Gaussian elimination, the Horner scheme, improved calculations of pi, and negative numbers. <b>Hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> roads and canals were built to facilitate transport, commerce, tax collection, communication, and movement of military troops. The Han-era Chinese also employed several types of bridges to cross waterways and deep gorges, such as beam bridges, arch bridges, simple suspension bridges, and pontoon bridges. Han ruins of defensive city walls made of brick or rammed earth still stand today.|$|E
