50|$|Sensors {{and their}} {{placement}} are never perfect, therefore most systems incorporate a delay time before switching. This delay time is often user-selectable, but a typical <b>default</b> <b>value</b> <b>is</b> 15 minutes. This {{means that the}} sensor must detect no motion for the entire delay time before the lights are switched. Most systems switch lights off {{at the end of}} the delay time, but more sophisticated systems with dimming technology reduce lighting slowly to a minimum level (or zero) over several minutes, to minimize the potential disruption in adjacent spaces. If lights are off and an occupant re-enters a space, most current systems switch lights back on when motion is detected. However, systems designed to switch lights off automatically with no occupancy, and that require the occupant to switch lights on when they re-enter are gaining in popularity due to their potential for increased energy savings. These savings accrue because in a spaces with access to daylight the occupant may decide on their return that they no longer require supplemental electric light.|$|E

40|$|All of {{the methods}} for {{predicting}} traffic conditions at intersections provide <b>default</b> <b>values</b> for saturation flow rates and their adjustment factors, lost times, and other parameters. Because these parameters are difficult to measure, {{the use of the}} <b>default</b> <b>values</b> <b>is</b> a common practice and it can cause significant bias in the results if the actual local <b>values</b> <b>are</b> different. The main objective of this research was to investigate the variability of capacity and delay parameters used in engineering tools for predicting delays and for determining level of service (LOS) at signalized intersections in Indiana. The variability investigation produced Indiana <b>default</b> <b>values</b> that better reflect the behavior of Indiana drivers at signalized intersection than the <b>default</b> <b>values</b> recommended in the existing engineering tools and based on arbitrary assumptions or nationwide studies. Traffic was observed at 19 intersections. A procedure combining Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) methodology and linear regression was used to estimate the capacity parameters. Variability was investigated using weighted linear regression. Although the state-average <b>values</b> for Indiana <b>are</b> similar to the HCM-recommended values, the base saturation flow rate and PHF exhibit strong variability depending on population size and other local factors. On average, the saturation flow rate in medium towns was 8 % and in small towns it was 21 % lower than large towns. These results confirm the findings for Florida and particularly for Kentucky. A table with the recommended base saturation flow rates is presented. The start-up lost time, green time extension and heavy vehicle equivalency factor were very close to the HCM values. The population size, morning/afternoon rush hour, and volume considerably affected the PHF. The improvement of delay estimation when using local capacity parameters instead of <b>default</b> <b>values</b> <b>was</b> assessed using Highway Capacity Software 2000 (HCS 2000) by comparing the results to the measured delays. The average mean error for the <b>default</b> parameter <b>values</b> <b>was</b> slightly higher than for local values. Also, the standard deviation of the estimate for local parameter <b>values</b> <b>was</b> also lower...|$|R
