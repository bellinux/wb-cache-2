The {{aim of the}} Young Cities Team 2 {{sub-project}} “Energy Infrastructure systems” {{consists of}} the development and the design of energy efficient buildings and <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> <b>systems</b> for new Towns in Iran. This document gives an overview over the design {{and the development of}} the <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> <b>systems</b> for the 35 ha pilot area in Hashtgerd New Town. In general, these energy concepts are suitable for the supply of all types of buildings (residential, commercial, cultural, etc.), but in this paper the focus lies on the <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> of residential buildings. It is possible to reach the aim “energy efficiency” through several methods, for example by using common Iranian building technologies in different ways, or through the improvement of these technologies. Another possibility lies in the use of available renewable energy sources, for example the very high potential of the solar irradiation in combination with solar thermal technologies for heating and cooling. Energy efficiency can be also realized with new introduced building technologies, such as centralized, semi-centralized and de-centralized <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> <b>systems,</b> based on co- and tri-generation technologies and district heating networks.
