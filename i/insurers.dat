5|$|After {{the slave}} ship reached port at Black River, Jamaica, Zongs owners made {{a claim to}} their <b>insurers</b> {{for the loss of}} the slaves. When the <b>insurers</b> refused to pay, the {{resulting}} court cases (Gregson v Gilbert (1783) 3 Doug. KB 232) held that in some circumstances, the deliberate killing of slaves was legal and that <b>insurers</b> could be required to pay for the slaves' deaths. The judge, Lord Chief Justice, the Earl of Mansfield, ruled against the syndicate owners in this case, due to new evidence being introduced suggesting the captain and crew were at fault.|$|E

40|$|In 2006, {{a number}} of {{far-reaching}} reforms have been implemented in the Dutch health insurance system. Giving Dutch consumers the freedom to change health plans every year increases consumer mobility. The idea is that especially consumers who are dissatisfied with their <b>insurer</b> will decide to switch health plan, thereby improving {{the efficiency of the}} health care system. Up to date, however, it is unknown why consumers change health <b>insurer</b> or decide to be loyal to their <b>insurer.</b> The present study aimed to examine the influence of <b>insurer</b> trust, experiences with a health plan, and identification with a health <b>insurer</b> on health <b>insurer</b> loyalty. Methods: An access-panel consisting of over 10 000 people insured at one particular health <b>insurer</b> was used. A subgroup of members (N ¼ 1500) was approached to answer questions on <b>insurer</b> trust, identification with the <b>insurer,</b> and past experiences with the <b>insurer.</b> In addition, questions on <b>insurer</b> loyalty were posed. Respondents indicated whether they intended to stay with their health <b>insurer</b> or considered changing health <b>insurer.</b> Results: Preliminary results show that most people (72 %) were insured at the health plan in question for 10 years or more. This suggests that people are loyal to their health plan. People mostly reported positive experiences with their health plan providing an explanation for this loyalty. Conclusions: People appear to be loyal to their health <b>insurer,</b> partly because they are satisfied with the provided service. The question, however, remains whether people will stay insured at the same health plan when changing health plan becomes easier. To answer this question, the relationships between <b>insurer</b> trust, past experiences with the <b>insurer,</b> identification with the <b>insurer,</b> and <b>insurer</b> loyalty are currently examined.

The <b>insurer’s</b> claim rate is also allowed to vary to reflect exposure changes that result from the <b>insurer’s</b> strategy. We analyze ruin probabilities using both simulation and a Lundberg-type upper bound which is developed in the paper.

5000|$|We {{conclude}} the Canons of Ethics impose upon lawyers {{hired by the}} <b>insurer</b> an obligation {{to explain to the}} insured and the <b>insurer</b> the full implications of joint representation in situations where the <b>insurer</b> has reserved its rights to deny coverage. If the insured does not give an informed consent to continued representation, counsel must cease to represent both. Moreover, in the absence of such consent, where there are divergent interests of the insured and the <b>insurer</b> brought about by the <b>insurer's</b> reservation of rights based on possible noncoverage under the insurance policy, the <b>insurer</b> must pay the reasonable cost for hiring independent counsel by the insured. The <b>insurer</b> may not compel the insured to surrender control of the litigation ... Disregarding the common interests of both insured and <b>insurer</b> in finding total nonliability in the third party action, the remaining interests of the two diverge to such an extent as to create an actual, ethical conflict of interest warranting payment for the insureds' independent counsel.|$|R
