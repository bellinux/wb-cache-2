40|$|Directed {{information}} or its variants are utilized {{extensively in the}} characterization of the capacity of channels with memory and feedback, nonanticipative lossy data compression, and their generalizations to networks. In this paper, we derive several functional and topological properties <b>of</b> <b>directed</b> <b>information</b> for general abstract alphabets (complete separable metric spaces) using the topology of weak convergence of probability measures. These include convexity of the set of consistent distributions, which uniquely define causally conditioned distributions, convexity and concavity <b>of</b> <b>directed</b> <b>information</b> {{with respect to the}} sets of consistent distributions, weak compactness of these sets of distributions, their joint distributions and their marginals. Furthermore, we show lower semicontinuity <b>of</b> <b>directed</b> <b>information,</b> and under certain conditions we also establish continuity <b>of</b> <b>directed</b> <b>information.</b> Finally, we derive variational equalities for directed information, including sequential versions. These may be viewed as the analogue of the variational equalities <b>of</b> mutual <b>information</b> (utilized in Blahut-Arimoto algorithm). In summary, we extend the basic functional and topological properties <b>of</b> mutual <b>information</b> to <b>directed</b> information. These properties are discussed in the context of extremum problems <b>of</b> <b>directed</b> <b>information.</b> Comment: 49 pages, 2 figures, Submitted for publication to IEEE Transactions on Information Theor...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-The notion <b>of</b> <b>directed</b> <b>information</b> is {{introduced}} for stochastic processes in continuous time. Properties and opera-tional interpretations are presented for this notion <b>of</b> <b>directed</b> <b>information,</b> which generalizes mutual information between stochastic processes {{in a similar}} manner as Massey's original notion <b>of</b> <b>directed</b> <b>information</b> generalizes Shannon's mutual information in the discrete-time setting. As a key application, Duncan's theorem is generalized to estimation problems in which the evolution of the target signal is affected by the past channel noise, and the causal minimum mean squared error estimation is related to directed information from the target signal to the observation corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise. An analogous relationship holds for the Poisson channel. I...|$|R

Environmental distances are relatively large and cannot be perceived in entirety {{from a single}} place. Directly-acquired knowledge of n~ronmental distance {{is based on the}} sensorimotor apprehension of nformation from the body or from the environment during locomotion. The paper is organized around the idea that distance knowledge is derived from multiple, partially redundant information sources. After briefly discussing general issues, I review literature on <b>direct</b> sources <b>of</b> distance <b>information,</b> including environmental features, travel time, and travel effort. Theories of how these sources provide information about distance are considered. To date, only information from environmental features has received much empirical support s a <b>direct</b> source <b>of</b> distance knowledge, particularly to theextent hat he features segment routes into vistas. Key weaknesses in the empirical literature are discussed, and important research directions are identified. ...|$|R
