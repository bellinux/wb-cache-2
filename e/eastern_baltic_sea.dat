In the present study, the suitability of this technique for identifying the origin and distribution of Atlantic cod Gadus morhua L. from the <b>Baltic</b> <b>Sea</b> was examined using laser ablation-ICPMS. The capacity to distinguish individuals from different <b>Baltic</b> <b>Sea</b> stocks and from the adjacent North Sea stock based on incoporation of stock-specific elemental fingerprints along otolith growth axes was investigated. It was further tested if different origins led to spawning-site specific element concentrations in otolith cores. The results indicate that microchemical analyses of Baltic cod otoliths are applicable for differentiating individuals of different stocks. Analyses of similarities including 12 element/calcium ratios resulted in significant differences between individuals from the eastern and the western <b>Baltic</b> <b>Sea</b> and between North <b>Sea</b> and <b>Baltic</b> <b>Sea</b> samples. Sr/Ca, Ba/Ca, Y/Ca, Mg/Ca, Zr/Ca and Mn/Ca ratios had the strongest discriminatory power.

40|$|Variations in oxygen {{conditions}} in the Baltic are influenced by several mechanisms. Generally, the frequency and magnitude of major inflows {{have been identified as}} the most crucial process for the renewal of oxygen-depleted water masses in the <b>Baltic</b> <b>Sea.</b> Furthermore, enhanced degradation of suspended organic matter by bacteria {{over the past few decades}} has increased oxygen consumption. Finally, the effects of large-scale climate warming are causing long-term variations in oxygen content and saturation as an observed increase in temperature has led to a general decrease in oxygen solubility of water masses. Oxygen-dependent relationships based on field data and laboratory experiments were used to analyse the impact of the observed decrease in oxygen content on <b>eastern</b> <b>Baltic</b> cod (Gadus morhua) stock-specific processes (e. g. survival rates of eggs, settlement probability of juveniles, habitat utilization of spawning fish, age structure of successful spawners, food consumption rates of adult fish).

Ecological restoration by means of biomanipulation, i. e., by fishing out planktivores to reduce the predation pressure on herbivorous zooplankton, {{has proved to be}} an effective tool in restoring degraded lakes and coastal ecosystems. Whether biomanipulation may prove a useful restoration method in open and structurally complex marine ecosystems is, however, still unknown. To promote a recovery of the collapsed stock of <b>Eastern</b> <b>Baltic</b> cod (Gadus morhua), large-scale biomanipulation of sprat (Sprattus sprattus), the main planktivore in the <b>Baltic</b> <b>Sea,</b> has been suggested as a possible management approach. We study the effect of biomanipulation on sprat using a statistical food-web model, which integrates internal interactions between the main fish species of the Central <b>Baltic</b> <b>Sea,</b> with external forcing through commercial fishing, zooplankton, and climate. By running multiple, stochastic simulations of reductions in sprat spawning stock biomass (SSB) only minor increases in cod SSB were detected, none of which brought the cod significantly above ecologically safe levels. On the contrary, reductions in cod fishing mortality and/or improved climatic conditions would promote a significant recovery of the stock. By this we demonstrate that an ecosystem-scale biomanipulation, with the main focus of reinstating the dominance of cod in the <b>Baltic</b> <b>Sea</b> may likely be ecologically ineffective, operationally difficult, and costly. We argue that reducing exploitation pressure on <b>Eastern</b> <b>Baltic</b> cod to ecologically sound levels is a far more appealing management strategy in promoting a long-term recovery and a sustainable fishery of the stock...|$|R
