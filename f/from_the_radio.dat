5|$|The {{cast for}} Planet B comes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Radio</b> Drama Company, a {{repertory}} radio company. This {{is because they}} cost nothing to use and the budget for the show is small. The cast of the Radio Drama Company changes around every six months, which means that cast of Planet B changes every series.|$|E
50|$|In 1976, a {{paperback}} anthology with three short stories adapted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> series' <b>radio</b> scripts {{was published by}} Pocket Library, Strange Tales <b>from</b> <b>the</b> CBS <b>Radio</b> Mystery Theater, edited and with a foreword by Himan Brown.|$|R
5000|$|The {{album was}} very well taken by both the critics and public, so it got more {{attention}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>radios</b> who started broadcasting it more frequently. [...] "Dulces Tormentos" [...] {{was one of the}} most spread songs of the album.|$|R

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1920s and through to the 1930s, the thinking on noise was dominated by the radio engineers' concern with external static. In modern terminology, this would include random (thermal and shot) noise but those concepts were relatively unknown and little understood at the time despite an early paper by Schottky in 1918 on shot noise. To the radio engineers of the time, static meant externally generated interference. The line of attack against noise <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> engineers included developing directional antennae and moving to higher frequencies where the problem was known not to be so severe.|$|E
5|$|For many years, the Moon {{has been}} {{recognized}} as an excellent site for telescopes. It is relatively nearby; astronomical seeing is not a concern; certain craters near the poles are permanently dark and cold, and thus especially useful for infrared telescopes; and radio telescopes {{on the far side}} would be shielded <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> chatter of Earth. The lunar soil, although it poses a problem for any moving parts of telescopes, can be mixed with carbon nanotubes and epoxies and employed in the construction of mirrors up to 50 meters in diameter. A lunar zenith telescope can be made cheaply with ionic liquid.|$|E
5|$|Seyfert's Sextet is a {{group of}} six galaxies, four of which are {{interacting}} gravitationally and two of which simply appear {{to be a part of}} the group despite their greater distance. The gravitationally bound cluster lies at a distance of 190 million light-years from Earth and is approximately 100,000 light-years across, making Seyfert's Sextet one of the densest galaxy group known. Astronomers predict that the four interacting galaxies will eventually merge to form a large elliptical galaxy. The radio source 3C 326 was originally though to emanate from a giant elliptical galaxy. However, in 1990, it was shown that the source is instead a brighter, smaller galaxy a few arcseconds north. This object, designated 3C 326 N, has enough gas for star formation, but is being inhibited due to the energy <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> galaxy nucleus.|$|E

5|$|The {{absence of}} air makes outer space an ideal {{location}} for astronomy at all wavelengths {{of the electromagnetic}} spectrum. This {{is evidenced by the}} spectacular pictures sent back by the Hubble Space Telescope, allowing light from more than 13billion years ago—almost to the time of the Big Bang—to be observed. However, not every location in space is ideal for a telescope. The interplanetary zodiacal dust emits a diffuse near-infrared radiation that can mask the emission of faint sources such as extrasolar planets. Moving an infrared telescope out past the dust will increase the effectiveness of the instrument. Likewise, a site like the Daedalus crater {{on the far side of}} the Moon could shield a radio telescope <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> frequency interference that hampers Earth-based observations.|$|E
5|$|The first {{national}} ensemble licence for DAB <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Radio</b> Authority was advertised in 1998 and one applicant {{applied for the}} licence. The licence was awarded to the GWR Group and NTL Broadcast, who since the launch were renamed Arqiva. The two companies formed the Digital One ensemble, which began broadcasting on 15 November 1999. The Digital One ensemble has grown and is currently available to over 90% of the UK population although an Ofcom report into Digital Radio in 2015 puts robust household coverage at 89.8% of the UK.|$|E
5|$|Tsiranana's ouster {{ushered in}} the socialist Second Republic under Admiral Didier Ratsiraka in 1975, but the {{ineffectiveness}} of the regime's philosophy soon fomented popular disillusionment. Persistent in their exposure of political problems like corruption and abuse of power under Ratsiraka, Mahaleo repeatedly saw their songs banned <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio.</b> The band successfully countered efforts at censorship by encouraging their fans to produce and distribute bootlegged recordings of their concerts. They continued to gain in popularity, regularly performing live shows across Madagascar and launching frequent tours {{to play for the}} Malagasy diaspora in major French population centers like Paris, Toulouse and Marseille.|$|E

25|$|The Telegoons (1963–1964) was a 15-minute BBC puppet show {{featuring}} {{the voices of}} Milligan, Secombe and Sellers and adapted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> scripts. 26 episodes were made. The series was briefly repeated immediately after its original run, and all episodes are known to survive, having been unofficially released online.|$|E
25|$|Episodes and anthologies <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> series were {{released}} on vinyl LP in the 1960s, {{as well as}} four re-makes of television scripts; an annual LP was issued of radio episodes (without the incidental music) between 1980 and 1984.
