25|$|The {{vibration}} {{produced by}} the player's lips has harmonics, i.e., it has frequency components falling exactly in the ratio 1:2:3 etc. However, the non-harmonic spacing of the instrument's resonances means that the harmonics of the <b>fundamental</b> <b>note</b> are not systematically assisted by instrument resonances, as is usually the case for Western wind instruments (e.g., in a clarinet, the 1st 3rd and 5th harmonics of the reed are assisted by resonances of the bore, at least for notes in the low range).|$|E

25|$|In recent years, several {{makers have}} begun to market compact B/C trombones that are {{especially}} well suited for young children learning to play the trombone who cannot reach the outer slide positions of full-length instruments. The <b>fundamental</b> <b>note</b> of the unenhanced length is C, but the short valved attachment that puts the instrument in B is open when the trigger is not depressed. While such instruments have no seventh slide position, C and B natural may be comfortably accessed on {{the first and second}} positions by using the trigger. A similar design ("Preacher model") was marketed by C.G. Conn in the 1920s, also under the Wurlitzer label. Currently, B/C trombones are available from many manufacturers, including German makers Günter Frost, Thein and Helmut Voigt, as well as the Yamaha Corporation.|$|E

2500|$|Much of the time, {{some or all}} {{of these}} chords are played in the {{harmonic}} seventh (7th) form.

Blues seven chords add to the harmonic chord a note with a frequency in a 7:4 ratio to the <b>fundamental</b> <b>note.</b> At a 7:4 ratio, it is not close to any interval on the conventional Western diatonic scale. For convenience or by necessity it is often approximated by a minor seventh interval or a dominant seventh chord.|$|E

He also published a book on harmony (Paris, 1965) and a monograph on Johann Sebastian Bach (Paris, 1970). His comprehensive chronology and analysis of the life and complete works of J. S.

5000|$|Certain low brass {{instruments}} such as trombone, tuba, euphonium, and alto horn are whole-tube and {{can play the}} fundamental tone of each harmonic series with relative ease. Furthermore, the low brass often use extra valves to extend their range uniformly, since the fundamental is chromatically discontinuous with the lowest 2nd harmonic reachable on a three-valve instrument or via the seven-position slide on a trombone.

40|$|We {{present a}} method for {{real-time}} pitch-tracking which generates an estimation of the relative amplitudes of the partials relative to the fundamental for each detected note. We then employ a subtraction method, whereby lower fundamentals in the spectrum are accounted for when looking at higher <b>fundamental</b> <b>notes.</b> By tracking notes which are playing, we look for note off events and continually update our expected partial weightings for each note. The resulting algorithm makes use of these relative partial weightings within its decision process. We have evaluated the system against a data set and compared it with specialised offline pitch-trackers. © July 2009 - All copyright remains with the individual authors...|$|R
50|$|A gourd is {{attached}} to the bow to act as a resonator. A wooden stick and the inzebe rattle are also used. Two loops bring the string closer to the bow, the third (attached to the gourd resonator by a cord) divides the string into two unequal lengths. This creates two different notes, usually a fourth or a fifth, as <b>fundamental</b> <b>notes.</b> To keep the resonator and the musical bow apart, a cloth or a pad of banana peel is placed between the two to ensure that there is no direct contact between the bow and the gourd that might interfere with sound production.|$|R
50|$|The tenor {{trombone}} has a <b>fundamental</b> <b>note</b> of B and {{is usually}} treated as a non-transposing instrument (see below). Tenor trombones with C as their <b>fundamental</b> <b>note</b> were almost equally popular in the mid-19th century in Britain and France. As the trombone in its simplest form has neither crooks, valves nor keys to lower the pitch by a specific interval, trombonists use seven chromatic slide positions. Each position progressively increases {{the length of the}} air column, thus lowering the pitch.|$|E

25|$|The lülü {{formed the}} ritual scale to which many {{instruments}} were tuned. The {{name of the}} lowest sound, huangzhong also implyed 'musical correctness.' Its pitch formed a pitch standard, setting the base pitch of zithers, flutes and singers of imperial court orchestras. Straight-walled pitch pipes without finger holes were made of cast metal, their lengths specified by court regulations. The resulting chromatic scale provided twelve <b>fundamental</b> <b>notes</b> {{for the construction of}} the musical scales themselves. The lülü also has a cosmological value: its notes describe the energetic frequency of the twelve months of the year, the daily rhythm of the twelve bi-hours of the Chinese clock, the twelve main acupuncture meridians, etc.|$|R

50|$|There are {{at least}} two <b>fundamental</b> <b>notes</b> {{produced}} by all musical bows, an open (when the player does not shorten it or touch it) and a closed (where the string is shortened or stopped by the player's hand).

These two notes can already be on the string, if it is divided or stopped by a string attached to the gourd, {{as in the case of}} umakhweyana, xitende, berimbau, hungu, etc. The pitch difference between a vu and a ba is usually about a whole tone. In certain places in can be closer to a semitone (e.g. Zulu) or closer to a minor third (Tsonga).|$|R
50|$|In a drum kit, {{the bass}} drum {{is much smaller}} than in the {{traditional}} orchestral use, most commonly 20 or 22 in in diameter.

5000|$|By {{overblowing}} a cylindrical closed tube, a note can {{be obtained}} that is approximately a twelfth above the <b>fundamental</b> <b>note</b> of the tube. This is sometimes described as one-fifth above the octave of the <b>fundamental</b> <b>note.</b> For example, if the <b>fundamental</b> <b>note</b> of a closed pipe is C1, then overblowing the pipe gives G2, which is one-twelfth above C1. Alternatively {{we can say that}} G2 is one-fifth above C2 — the octave above C1. Adjusting the taper of this cylinder for a decreasing cone can tune the second harmonic or overblown note close to the octave position or 8th. (ref: Horns,Strings and Harmony, by Arthur H. Benade.) Opening a small [...] "speaker hole" [...] at the Phi point, or shared [...] "wave/node" [...] position will cancel the fundamental frequency and force the tube to resonate at a 12th above the fundamental. This technique is used in a Recorder by pinching open the dorsal thumb hole. Moving this small hole upwards, closer to the voicing will make it an [...] "Echo Hole" [...] (Dolmetsch Recorder Modification) that will give a precise half note above the fundamental when opened. Note: Slight size or diameter adjustment is needed to zero in on the precise half note frequency.|$|E
