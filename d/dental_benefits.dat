25|$|Some {{health care}} plans are {{exempted}} from Title I requirements, such as long-term health plans and limited-scope plans such as dental or vision plans that are offered separately from the general health plan. However, if such benefits {{are part of the}} general health plan, then HIPAA still applies to such benefits. For example, if the new plan offers <b>dental</b> <b>benefits,</b> then it must count creditable continuous coverage under the old health plan towards any of its exclusion periods for <b>dental</b> <b>benefits.</b>|$|E
25|$|On April 12, 2006, Governor Romney {{signed the}} health legislation. He vetoed eight {{sections}} {{of the health care}} legislation, including the controversial employer assessment. He vetoed provisions providing <b>dental</b> <b>benefits</b> to poor residents on the Medicaid program, and providing health coverage to senior and disabled legal immigrants not eligible for federal Medicaid. The legislature promptly overrode six of the eight gubernatorial section vetoes, on May 4, 2006, and by mid-June 2006 had overridden the remaining two.|$|E

50|$|Delta Dental's roots {{go back to}} 1954 {{with the}} {{formation}} of dental service corporations in California, Oregon and Washington, which were created by dentists who recognized the need to increase access to oral health care. Led by Washington Dental Service (WDS), Delta Dental began by providing <b>dental</b> <b>benefit</b> programs for organized labor unions. WDS underwent a rebranding campaign in 2013 and now goes by the name Delta Dental of Washington.|$|R

A year later, the first multi-state program was sold by WDS to the International Association of Machinists. WDS ceded the administration for enrollees in other states to other Delta Dental member companies and contracted with the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association for administration in those states without a Delta Dental affiliate organization.|$|R
25|$|On July 12, 2010, it was {{revealed}} that former Sheriff Mike Carona received over $215,000 in pension checks in 2009, despite his felony conviction. A 2005 state law denied a public pension to public officials convicted of wrongdoing in office, however, that law only applied to benefits accrued after December 2005. Carona became eligible for his pension at age 50, and is also entitled, by law, to medical and <b>dental</b> <b>benefits.</b> It was noted that the county's retirement system faces a massive shortfall totaling $3.7 billion unfunded liabilities, and Carona was one of approximately 400 retired Orange County public servants who received more than $100,000 in benefits in 2009. Also on the list of those receiving extra-large pension checks is former treasurer-tax collector Robert Citron, whose investments, which were made while consulting psychics and astrologers, led Orange County into bankruptcy in 1994.|$|E
500|$|On April 12, 2006, the {{governor}} signed the resulting Massachusetts health reform law, commonly called [...] "Romneycare", which requires nearly all Massachusetts residents to {{buy health insurance}} coverage or face escalating tax penalties, such as {{the loss of their}} personal income tax exemption. The bill also established means-tested state subsidies for people who lacked adequate employer insurance and whose income was below a threshold, using funds that had covered the health costs of the uninsured. He vetoed eight sections of the health care legislation, including a controversial $295-per-employee assessment on businesses that do not offer health insurance and provisions guaranteeing <b>dental</b> <b>benefits</b> to Medicaid recipients. The legislature overrode all eight vetoes, but {{the governor}}'s office said the differences were not essential. The law was {{the first of its kind}} in the nation and became the signature achievement of Romney's term in office.|$|E

40|$|To {{compare the}} impact {{of health care reform}} on the {{pediatric}} <b>dental</b> <b>benefit</b> across state health insurance Exchanges through the focused evaluation of (1) existing plan designs, (2) legislative processes through which these plans are selected and regulated, and (3) the role of the pediatric dental profession. Three states were selected based on type of Exchange implemented, identified as State-Based (SB), State-Partnered (SP), and Federally-Facilitated (FF). Data were collected through public record investigation and health policy expert interviews. A cost-analysis was completed for a total of 10, 427 insurance plans from the three states. Sixteen confidential health policy expert interviews were conducted at state and federal levels. Individual monthly premium costs for embedded plans were found to have minimal differences when compared to the combined monthly premium costs of medical plans and stand-alone dental plans purchased separately (p= 0. 11). Financial implications of cost-sharing designs for embedded plans are limited, restricting consumer protections for the dental patient in comparison to medical coverage. Policy change for the federal regulation of dental insurance is markedly more challenging than for medical insurance given existing barriers resultant from the historical separation of the dental insurance industry from traditional medical insurance. Despite comparable premium costs across varying plan designs, the true affordability and quality of the state?s pediatric <b>dental</b> <b>benefit</b> requires greater transparency and consistent policy standards...|$|R

2500|$|On October 27, 2011, the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network (SLDN) {{had brought}} suit {{in federal court}} in Massachusetts on behalf of several {{military}} servicemembers and veterans in same-sex marriages. The benefits at issue in that case, McLaughlin v. Panetta, included medical and <b>dental</b> <b>benefits,</b> basic housing and transportation allowances, family separation benefits, visitation rights in military hospitals, and survivor benefit plans. On June 27, the federal judge hearing the case asked the parties to explain by July 18 why the logic that found Windsor unconstitutional did not apply to that definition as well. On July 18, the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group BLAG, which had defended DOMA and the restrictive definitions of marriage acknowledged that [...] "he Supreme Court recently resolved the issue of DOMA Section 3's constitutionality" [...] but took no position on the other statutes except to say that the constitutionality of those definitions [...] "remains open". The Department of Justice told the court that it would not defend those statutes. BLAG asked to withdraw from a similar lawsuit {{in federal court in}} California, Cooper-Harris v. United States, on July 22. On August 29, Judge Consuelo Marshall ruled that the provisions of Title 38 of the U.S. Code that define spouse so as to exclude those in same-sex marriages are unconstitutional.|$|E
2500|$|On October 27, 2011, the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network (SLDN) brought suit {{in federal}} court on behalf of several {{military}} servicemembers and veterans in same-sex marriages. In a November 21 filing {{in the case of}} McLaughlin v. Panetta, they wrote, [...] "Any claim that DOMA, as applied to military spousal benefits, survives rational basis review is strained because paying unequal benefits to service members runs directly counter to the military values of uniformity, fairness and unit cohesion." [...] The benefits at issue include medical and <b>dental</b> <b>benefits,</b> basic housing and transportation allowances, family separation benefits, visitation rights in military hospitals, and survivor benefit plans. The case was assigned to Judge Richard G. Stearns. One of the plaintiffs in the case, lesbian Charlie Morgan, who was undergoing chemotherapy, met with an assistant to Boehner on February 9, 2012, to ask him to consider not defending DOMA. The case is on hold at the request of both sides in anticipation of the outcome of two other First Circuit cases on appeal, Gill v. Office of Personnel Management and Massachusetts v. United States Department of Health and Human Services. On February 17, the DOJ announced it could not defend the constitutionality of the statutes challenged in the case. In May 2012, the parties filed briefs arguing whether BLAG has a right to intervene. On June 27, Stearns asked the parties to explain by July 18 why given the decision in Windsor he should not find for the plaintiffs. On July 18, BLAG's response acknowledged that [...] "he Supreme Court recently resolved the issue of DOMA Section 3's constitutionality" [...] and asked to be allowed to withdraw from the case. It took no position on the two statutes at issue in the case, which define a [...] "spouse" [...] as [...] "a person of the opposite sex", except to say that [...] "the question of whether [...] is constitutional remains open".|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} effect of dental Medicaid reforms {{in the state of}} Virginia on dental plan performance. Methods: This project is a {{retrospective}} cohort study of 825, 000 dental claims obtained from the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services. This cohort includes dental claims for children enrolled in Virginia’s Medicaid program from July 1, 2002 through June 30, 2008. The independent variable was enrollment pre or post policy reform with July 1, 2005 as the period dividing date. The dependent variable was <b>dental</b> <b>benefit</b> utilization measured as the average number of restorative, preventative, and total procedures. Statistical methods include Welch’s t-test and repeated measures mixed model ANOVA controlling for gender, race, age, length of enrollment, gaps in patient enrollment, citizenship status, and geographic location. 	 Results: This cohort of data showed {{a significant increase in the}} total number of procedures utilized by enrolled children (P value 3 ̆c 0. 001).

40|$|Objectives: The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to study the major determinants for dental services utilization among middle-aged Hong Kong Chinese in a longitudinal study using an expanded Andersen and Newman model as the theoretical framework. Methods: A random sample of 372 middle-aged Hong Kong Chinese were interviewed and clinically examined in an oral health survey. The findings were explained to the subjects and they were advised to seek care from their own dentist as appropriate. Results: A total of 322 subjects were interviewed over the telephone after 12 months. About half had visited a dentist within the study period. Results of the bivariate analysis showed that proportionally more subjects who had <b>dental</b> <b>benefit</b> coverage, had prevention-oriented attitudes, were regular users of dental services, had received counseling from a dentist, or had more filled teeth at the baseline examination had visited a dentist within the study period. Logistic regression analysis produced a final model consisting of seven factors and three interaction terms that was able to classify 68 percent of the subjects into the correct user category. Conclusion: The expanded Andersen and Newman model was useful as a theoretical framework in studying the dental services utilization behaviors of the Hong Kong adults. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
