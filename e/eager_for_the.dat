The events, commonly featuring mock sorting, games, face painting, and other live entertainment have achieved popularity with Potter fans and have been highly successful in attracting fans and selling books with nearly nine million of the 10.8 million initial print copies of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince sold in the first 24 hours.|$|E
5|$|When Crèvecœur {{offered his}} {{manuscript}} essays to the London publishers Davies & Davis in 1782, they were initially {{skeptical about the}} potential for the Letters to be successful. However, the work proved to be instantly popular in England for a variety of reasons. Proponents of political reform such as William Godwin and Thomas Paine approved of the radical anti-government implications of its message. Romantic writers admired, and were influenced by, its evocation of the natural landscape and the individual's relationship to it. More widely, in the final years of the Revolutionary War, the public was <b>eager</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> documentary detail Letters provided about America. The popularity of the book led to a second edition being called for only a year later.|$|E

After a period of some uncertainty and confusion, at 18:17 BST umpires Koertzen and Bowden removed the bails and pulled up the stumps to signal the end of the match.

25|$|After {{retiring}} as {{a player}} following the 1989 season, Cal Bruton became the Wildcats' general manager in 1990. <b>Eager</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> team to win its first NBL Championship, Bruton embarked on an active recruiting campaign during the off-season; a recruiting campaign that saw {{the introduction of a}} player that is regularly referred to as the Wildcats' greatest: Ricky 'Amazing' Grace. Grace teamed-up with Mike Ellis to create a dominating backcourt. The 1990 season began with turmoil as coach Alan Black was controversially fired after only two games, and was replaced by Cal Bruton. Despite the shaky start to the season, the Wildcats recovered to finish in fifth place with a 17–9 record. Entering the finals as underdogs, the Wildcats swept the Melbourne Tigers in the Elimination Finals and got their revenge over the North Melbourne Giants with a 2–1 victory in the Semi Finals to again face the Brisbane Bullets in their second Grand Final appearance.|$|E

25|$|Evidence of pagan {{influence}} on emerging Christian medical practice {{was provided by}} many prominent early Christian thinkers, such as Origen, Clement of Alexandria, and Augustine, who studied natural philosophy and held important aspects of secular Greek philosophy that were in line with Christian thought. They believed faith supported by sound philosophy was superior to simple faith. Other similarities between Christian and pagan views on medicine existed. Christian ideas {{about the role of}} physicians were influenced by previous pagan ideals. The classical idea of the physician as a selfless servant who had to endure unpleasant tasks and provide necessary, often painful treatment was of great {{influence on}} early Christian practitioners. The metaphor was not lost on Christians who viewed Christ as the ultimate physician. Another similarity shared with the pagan perspective was the view of the relationship between disease and the individual. Pagan philosophy had previously held that the pursuit of virtue should not be secondary to bodily concerns. Similarly, Christians felt that, while caring for the body was important, it was second to spiritual pursuits. Early Christianity was <b>eager,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> most part, to borrow these certain aspects of pagan classical philosophy.|$|E

Following the series' conclusion, IGN ranked [...] "Hearts and Minds" [...] 109th out of all episodes, commenting that as few viewers were interested in Shannon and Boone, it was difficult to be interested in an episode centered on them, particularly as it had little long-term impact.

In the Bhil Ramayana, Gautama attacks and imprisons Indra, who is freed when he promises to shower rain on the crops as the rain god.

[...] In November 1972, a Philadelphia district court placed an injunction against the NHL, preventing it from enforcing the reserve clause and freeing all players who had restraining orders against them, including Hull, to play with their WHA clubs.

500|$|During {{this time}} moves were afoot to prevent {{cancellation}} of matches {{by creating a}} new competition with a [...] "fixity of fixtures". The brainchild of Aston Villa's William McGregor, the competition became known as The Football League. Sudell himself suggested the name [...] "Football League", {{as an alternative to}} McGregor's suggestion, [...] "Association Football Union". Plans to create the competition had been ongoing for a period of months without Preston's involvement, but as the most skilful team McGregor was keen to interest them. Once involved, Sudell was <b>eager</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> embryonic League to assert primacy in relation to other competitions, joining with J. J. Bentley to propose that [...] "The clubs forming the League shall support each other and bind themselves to carry out in the strictest sense the arrangements for matches between them, and not allow them to be cancelled on account of any cup competition or other matches". Sudell was more financially minded than the egalitarian McGregor, and urged the League to dispense with proposals for equal sharing of gate money and residential requirements for players.|$|E
500|$|In 1485, Henry Tudor became King of England upon {{defeating}} Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth. In {{an effort}} to strengthen the Tudor claim to the throne and emphasise his family's Welsh, {{that is to say}} Romano-British, ancestry, Henry had royal genealogists trace his lineage back to the ancient British rulers and decided on naming his firstborn son after the legendary King Arthur. On this occasion, Camelot was identified as present-day Winchester, and his wife, Elizabeth of York, was sent to Saint Swithun's Priory (today Winchester Cathedral Priory) in order to give birth there. Born at Saint Swithun's Priory on 20 September 1486 at about 1 am, Arthur was Henry and Elizabeth's eldest child. [...] Arthur's birth was anticipated by French and Italian humanists <b>eager</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> start of a [...] "Virgilian golden age". Sir Francis Bacon wrote that although the Prince was born one month premature, he was [...] "strong and able". Young Arthur was viewed as [...] "a living symbol" [...] of not only the union between the House of Tudor and the House of York, to which his mother belonged as the daughter of Edward IV, but also {{of the end of the}} Wars of the Roses. In the opinion of contemporaries, Arthur was the great hope of the newly established House of Tudor.|$|E

500|$|The manga {{has also}} earned praise: a {{reviewer}} for Children's Bookwatch noted that Into the Woods [...] "ends on a tense cliffhanger, leaving the reader in anxious anticipation for more. Suitable for readers age ten {{to one hundred}} and ten, Warriors Tigerstar & Sasha #1: Into the Woods is especially recommended for cat lovers everywhere". Its sequel, Escape from the Forest, was also well reviewed: a reviewer for Publishers Weekly believed that girls would benefit from reading about Sasha leaving the powerful Tigerstar due to his [...] "growing violence". The art was also praised, with the reviewer writing that [...] "Hudson's artwork brings Sasha's emotional journey to life, showing each moment of fear, anxiety, contentment and joy. The cat's-eye perspective {{of many of the}} panels, in addition, add [...] a dramatic, energizing element to the book". The reviewer also wrote that [...] "a twist at the end will leave fans <b>eager</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next installment of Sasha's saga", and that the book would appeal to young adults trying to find their place in the world. Lisa Goldstein for School Library Journal also gave the book a positive review, writing that the plot would attract new fans and appeal to old fans. The reviewer also wrote that [...] "though the cover claims that this is a 'manga,' the straightforward illustrations are drawn in a simple, realistic style".|$|E
500|$|Critics {{noted the}} game's length as shorter than expected, with about ten hours of content. Clayman (IGN) had little desire to replay the solved puzzles and Bramwell (Eurogamer) was even <b>eager</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> game to end. Halverson (Play) planned {{to return to}} the game but wrote that he would have {{preferred}} five more hours of the single-player over the Xbox Live features. Reviewers were largely unimpressed with the extra Xbox Live cooperative play and score attack features. Halverson (Play) had hopes for Kameo and Psychonauts to rekindle developer interest in the 3D platforming genre, but concluded that such games were likely not to return. Clayman (IGN) did not find the game {{to live up to its}} publicity as a competitor against The Legend of Zelda series, though Theobald (GameSpy) thought Kameo boss battles were comparable. Pfister (1UP.com) noted several traditional Rare flourishes—lots of color and graphics effects, puns for character names—but ultimately wrote that Kameo was proof that Microsoft had received [...] "exactly what they paid for" [...] in its acquisition of Rare. Theobald (GameSpy) said that Rare had avoided its usual tropes of making players collect lots of items and poor character design, and made a [...] "worthy" [...] launch title. Nigel Kendall (The Times) wrote that the game was [...] "more cerebral" [...] than the console's other games, which were stereotypically about driving, football, or shooting. Kasavin (GameSpot) noted that Kameo was the most accessible launch title to players of all ages. In summary, he thought the game was a suitable fit for players' first experiences on the new Xbox 360.|$|E
500|$|Moonrise {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Sally Estes, writing for Booklist, praised Moonrise for its [...] "cliffhanger" [...] ending [...] "that will leave readers <b>eager</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next installment", {{as well as}} the suspenseful possibility of the destruction of the forest. A reviewer for Horn Book Review gave a positive review, praising the plot, characters, and writing. The reviewer stated that [...] "Hunter successfully weaves character, plot, and good writing into another readable story". Hilary Williamson, writing for BookLoons, gave Moonrise a positive review, calling it [...] "exciting" [...] and a [...] "gripping epic". A reviewer for Kirkus Reviews criticized the novel for mundane writing, easy-to-confuse names, {{and the use of the}} words [...] "meowed" [...] and [...] "mewed" [...] instead of [...] "said". The reviewer thought that the plot was [...] "marred by the same preciousness of its predecessor", but praised the plot for its [...] "enhanced complexity" [...] and suspenseful writing, saying that [...] "a small plot twist is refreshing and suspense builds steadily towards the final installment". [...] The novel has also been mentioned for containing [...] "magic, fantasy, and heroic adventure", and was recommended to fans of Harry Potter as possible reading material after that series' end. Moonrise reached The New York Times bestseller list for children's chapter books, holding the number two spot for two weeks. It was also ranked 121st on USA Todays bestseller list during the week of August 11, 2005. The work was also a success in Canada, reaching number seven on the Leader-Post children's bestseller list, and remaining in the top 15 for seven weeks. In a Fairfield, Greater Victoria store, Moonrise was reportedly more popular than Harry Potter.|$|E
