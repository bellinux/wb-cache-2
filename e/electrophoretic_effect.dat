40|$|The {{transport}} of preproteins into or across the mitochondrial inner membrane requires the membrane potential Δψ across this membrane. Two roles of Δψ in {{the import of}} cleavable preproteins have been described: an <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>effect</b> on the positively charged matrix-targeting sequences and the activation of the translocase subunit Tim 23. We report the unexpected finding that deletion of a segment within the sorting sequence of cytochrome b 2, which is located behind the matrix-targeting sequence, strongly influenced the Δψ-dependence of import. The differential Δψ-dependence was independent of the submitochondrial destination of the preprotein and was not attributable to the requirement for mitochondrial Hsp 70 or Tim 23. With a series of preprotein constructs, the net charge of the sorting sequence was altered, but the Δψ-dependence of import was not affected. These results suggested that the sorting sequence contributed to the import driving mechanism in a manner distinct from the two known roles of Δψ. Indeed, a charge-neutral amino acid exchange in the hydrophobic segment of the sorting sequence generated a preprotein with an even better import, i. e. one with lower Δψ-dependence than the wild-type preprotein. The sorting sequence functioned early in the import pathway since it strongly influenced the efficiency of translocation of the matrix-targeting sequence across the inner membrane. These results suggest a model whereby an <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>effect</b> of Δψ on the matrix-targeting sequence is complemented by an import-stimulating activity of the sorting sequence...|$|E

Here, we tested whether flow across the glomerular filter generates extracellular electrical potential differences, which could be an important determinant of glomerular filtration. In micropuncture experiments in Necturus maculosus, we measured a potential difference across the glomerular filtration barrier that was proportional to filtration pressure (− 0. 045 mV/ 10 cm H 2 O). The filtration-dependent potential was generated without temporal delay and was negative within Bowman's space. Perfusion with the cationic polymer protamine abolished the potential difference. We propose a mathematical model that considers the relative contributions of diffusion, convection, and <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>effects</b> on the total flux of albumin across the filter. According to this model, potential differences of − 0. 02 to − 0. 05 mV can induce <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>effects</b> that significantly influence the glomerular sieving coefficient of albumin.

Previous studies have suggested that the thylakoidal Delta pH plays a minor role in this translocation mechanism, but we show here that it can be essential for the translocation process, depending on the identity of the passenger protein and the concentration of ATP. Studies using chimeric proteins show that, whereas the presequence dictates the trans location pathway, the Delta pH requirement is dictated exclusively by the passenger protein; some passenger proteins are virtually Delta pH-independent whereas others are absolutely dependent. Delta pH requirement is not related to charge characteristics of the passenger proteins, ruling out an <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>effect,</b> Analysis of the 33 -kDa photosystem II protein reveals an inverse relationship between Delta pH requirement and ATP concentration; import into isolated thylakoids is inhibited 14 -fold by nigericin at moderate ATP concentrations, and totally inhibited when the ATP concentration is reduced to 2 mu M. The results indicate that the roles of the Delta pH and ATP overlap and suggest that the Delta pH may be obligatory when the passenger protein is abnormally difficult to translocate, possibly due to the folding of the polypeptide chain.

The method resolves the electrophoretic velocity of fluoro-spheres used as tracer particles in microPIV. This approach exploits the short transient regime of the EOF generated after a potential drop is imposed across a microchannel and before reaching quasisteady state. During the starting of the transient regime, the <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>effect</b> is dominant {{in the center of}} the channel and the EOF is negligible. By measuring the velocity of the tracer particles with a microPIV system during that starting period, their electrophoretic velocity is obtained. The technique also resolves the temporal evolution of the EOF with three regions identified. The first region occurs before the electroosmotic effect reaches the center of the channel, the second region extends until the EOF reaches steady state, and thereafter is the third region. The two time constants separating these regions are also obtained and compared to the theory. The zeta potential of 860 nm diameter polystyrene particles is calculated for different solutions including borate buffer, sodium chloride, and deionized water. Results show that the magnitudes of the electrophoretic and electroosmotic velocities are in the range of | 300 | to | 700 | µm/s for these measurements.

40|$|Nanostructures are {{nanometer}} scale structures (characteristic length less than 100 nm) such as nanowires, ultra-small junctions, etc. Since nanostructures are less stable, their characteristic volume {{is much smaller}} compared to defect sizes and their characteristic length is close to acoustical phonon wavelength. Moreover, because nanostructures include significantly fewer charge carriers than microscale structures, electronic noise in nanostructures is enhanced compared to microscale structures. Additionally, in microprocessors, due to the small gate capacitance and reduced noise margin (due to reduced supply voltage to keep the electrical field at a reasonable level), the electronic noise results in bit errors. On the other hand, the enhanced noise is useful for advanced sensing applications which are called fluctuation-enhanced sensing. In this dissertation, we first survey our earlier results about the limitation of noise posed on specific nano processors. Here, single electron logic is considered for voltage controlled logic with thermal excitations and generic shot noise is considered for current-controlled logic. Secondly, we discuss our recent results on the electronic noise in nanoscale sensors for SEnsing of Phage-Triggered Ion Cascade (SEPTIC, for instant bacterial detection) and for silicon nanowires for viral sensing. In the sensing of the phage-triggered ion cascade sensor, bacteriophage-infected bacteria release potassium ions and move randomly at the same time; therefore, electronic noise (i. e., stochastic signals) are generated.

40|$|As a droplet {{containing}} {{colloidal material}} dries on a surface, the suspended particles are deposited onto it. Aqueous colloidal droplets often leave {{the majority of}} particles at {{the periphery of the}} deposition area. This phenomenon is known as the coffee ring effect, and it arises when a radially outward evaporative flows dominates within a droplet as it dries. This deposition non-uniformity can impact a diverse range of applications. In medical diagnostic testing, it can introduce uncertainty into microarray test results, while in inkjet printing it can produce finer printed circuitry. Controlling colloidal deposition could allow for higher-quality medical diagnostics and printing techniques. Application of electric fields to evaporating droplets is a promising method for controlling the coffee ring effect. Applying a voltage across a droplet can produce electrowetting forces at the contact line and electrophoretic forces on suspended particles. These forces have the potential to influence contact line pinning, internal flows, and migration of particles within the droplet. Electric fields have previously been used to manipulate colloidal transport in droplets laden with a variety of particles. The present work experimentally characterizes the effects of the particle type, size, and actuation polarity on the contact line dynamics and resultant depositions of evaporating particle-laden droplets. Deionized water droplets were seeded with a variety of particles and evaporated on an SU- 8 photoresist substrates. Particle size was found {{to play a role in}} the final deposition patterns produced by carboxylate-modified polystyrene-laden droplets. Droplets with smaller particles repinned in the final stages of evaporation and produced ring depositions, while droplets with larger particles remained mobile and produced more uniform depositions. A comparison of the evaporation times to particle settling times, showed that gravitational effects may influence the deposition behavior of larger particles. Particle material also plays a role in the resultant deposition pattern. Titanium oxide-laden droplets tended to pin longer and exhibited smaller receding contact angles as compared to polystyrene-laden droplets. Titanium oxide-laden droplets also tended to leave less distinct rings and large uniform regions in the final depositions. Actuation polarity was found to influence contact line mobility during the evaporation of particle-free and polystyrene-laden droplets. Polystyrene-laden droplets exposed to negative DC electric fields receded in a slip-stick pattern, while those exposed to positive DC electric fields receded more uniformly. No evidence of electrophoretic migration was observed, as both field polarities produced similar deposition patterns. Work is ongoing to quantify the <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>effect...</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{theory for}} the {{frequency}} dependence of ionic conductivity of an electrolyte solution is presented. In this theory {{contributions to the}} conductivity from both the ion atmosphere relaxation and the <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>effects</b> are included in a self-consistent fashion. Mode coupling theory, combined with time-dependent density functional theory of ion atmosphere fluctuations, leads to expressions for these two contributions at finite frequencies. These expressions need to be solved self-consistently for the frequency dependence of the electrolyte friction and the ion conductivity at varying ion concentrations. In the limit of low concentration, the present theory reduces exactly to the well-known Debye–Falkenhagen (DF) expression of the frequency-dependent electrolyte friction when the non-Markovian effects in the ion atmosphere relaxation are ignored and in addition the ions {{are considered to be}} pointlike. The present theory also reproduces the expressions of the frequency-dependent conductivity derived by Chandra, Wei, and Patey when appropriate limiting situations are considered. We have carried out detailed numerical solutions of the self-consistent equations for concentrated solutions of a 1 : 1 electrolyte by using the expressions of pair correlation functions given by Attard. Numerical results reveal that the frequency dependence of the electrolyte friction at finite concentration can be quite different from that given by the DF expression. With the increase of ion concentration, the dispersion of the friction is found to occur at a higher frequency because of faster relaxation of the ion atmosphere. At low frequency, the real part of the conductivity shows a small increase with frequency which {{can be attributed to the}} well-known Debye–Falkenhagen effect. At high frequency, the conductivity decreases as expected. The extensions of the present theory to treat frequency-dependent diffusivities of charged colloid suspensions and conductivity of a dilute polyelectrolyte solution are discussed...|$|R

Among the metallic particles, plasmonic ones, like gold nanoparticles, exhibit a transverse localized surface plasmon mode and a longitudinal one, whose resonance red-shift depends on the aspect ratio (AR) of the nanoparticle. The larger the aspect ratio is, the stronger should be their optical anisotropy [2]. It is thus of interest to create reversible ordering of gold nanoparticles as their localized surface plasmon properties make them appealing for applications like bio-sensing or metamaterials. In this work, we study two kinds of particles: gold nanorods (GNRs) dispersed in water with an aspect ratio AR ≈ 10 (Φ= 10 nm) and new ultrathin gold nanowires (GNWs) dispersed in hexane with an AR up to 1000 (Φ= 1. 5 nm) [3]. With our recently developed electro-optic setup [1], we measure the birefringence induced in the sample by short pulses of high-frequency electric field. We study also the field-induced dichroism of the suspensions, using the same sample, sealed in a flat optical glass capillary, and the same experimental setup, mounted either on a polarizing microscope or on a UV-Vis spectrophotometer. In our experimental setup, the electrodes are placed outside the sample. In this configuration, they do not interact with the suspension avoiding <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>effect.</b> We observed alignment of both GNRs and GNWs along the applied electric field. Time responses of GNRs to the electric field are {{of the order of}} the millisecond and of more than 10 ms for GNWs. The saturated voltage is 4 times smaller in this last case compared to GNRs. Those results are in agreement with a change in the aspect ratio. In the visible range, birefringence appears negative as theoretically predicted [2]. More surprising, in both cases, a positive linear dichroism is revealed in the optical visible range. On the contrary, we expect a negative dichroism (ie extinction higher for polarization perpendicular to the electric field), while in this frequency range we are sensitive to the transverse mode of the plasmon band [4]. Spectroscopic measurements of the absorbance confirm this result but show in addition that the longitudinal mode is well polarized along the electric field: absorbance increases (decreasing) with the applied electric field for a polarization parallel (perpendicular) to this field. This suggests that the transverse mode is less sensitive to polarization than the longitudinal one (figure 1). This may arise from partial alignment causing light depolarization. Figure : 1. Absorbance spectra of Gold NanoRods suspension for light polarization perpendicular to the electric field. Reference spectrum has been recorded from the isotropic state. 2. Gold NanoWire fibers oriented at 45 ° between crossed polarizers. Concerning GNWs, similarly to carbon nanotubes, we observe their progressive assembly into fibers strictly oriented along the electric field due long range dipolar interaction. Those fibers appear highly birefringent between crossed polarizers (figure 2.). Their properties and the way to control their growth are under investigation.

30|$|We report here {{a direct}} current dielectrophoresis-based method for rapid {{concentration}} of nanoparticles in a microfluidic device. Dielectrophoresis (DEP) is {{the motion of}} a particle in a non-uniform electric field due to the unbalanced electrostatic forces on the particle’s induced dipole [8]. This phenomenon has been widely used for concentration, manipulation, separation, sorting, and transport of particles such as beads, bacteria, and cells [3 – 5, 9 – 12]. The majority of these applications employ AC electric fields generated by closely spaced microelectrode arrays that are generally constructed with MEMS-based microfabrication techniques. AC fields promote lower electrode polarization and <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>effects.</b> However, AC DEP faces certain issues that limit its applications, such as electrode fouling and electric field decay above the microelectrodes. An alternative to AC dielectrophoresis is the insulator-based DEP (iDEP) or DC DEP [5, 13, 14], in which no metal microelectrodes are embedded in the chip and DC electric fields are applied from an external electrode pair. This simplifies the fabrication of microdevices by eliminating the metal deposition processes. Insulator structures are robust and chemically inert. Effects such as electrochemical reactions and electrolysis observed in AC DEP {{are less likely to}} occur in iDEP. Cummings and Singh observed two flow regimes in insulator-based DEP: (1) ‘streaming DEP’ where streams of highly concentrated and rarified particles were created between the insulating posts at relatively low voltages and (2) ‘trapping DEP’ where particles were trapped around the insulating posts at higher voltages [15]. These observations lead to potential applications, for example, streaming DEP can be used to focus and transport particles, and trapping DEP can be used for particle concentration and filtration. The mechanics behind the phenomenon is the competition between electrokinetic (electrophoresis and electroosmosis) and dielectrophoretic forces [15]. The former is linearly proportional to the electric field, while the latter is proportional to the field squared. At low voltages, electrokinetic flow is dominant over DEP and diffusion, resulting in the regime of streaming DEP. At higher voltages, DEP is dominant, resulting in trapping DEP. This letter describes an insulating microstructure that is designed to highly focus and thus ‘amplify’ the electric field. Upon the application of voltage, the generated electric field is focused in the direction of fluid flow. Trapping DEP first occurs at these field-focused areas located at the downstream, while streaming DEP occurs upstream and continuously transports and delivers the particles. The described setup is capable of rapidly concentrating and collecting nanoparticles from continuous flow that is driven by electroosmosis.|$|R

We have investigated the conditions under which transferrin (the major iron-carrying protein in plasma) may release iron ions to catalyse the oxidation of LDL. Transferrin that had been incubated at pH 5. 5 released approximately 10 % of its bound iron in 24 h, as measured by ultrafiltration and atomic absorption spectroscopy. Furthermore, transferrin co-incubated with LDL and l-cysteine at pH 5. 5 resulted in the oxidation of the LDL as measured by thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and <b>electrophoretic</b> mobility. This <b>effect</b> was observed at transferrin concentrations as low as 40 % of its average plasma concentration. The release of iron from transferrin in atherosclerotic lesions due to a localised acidic pH may help to explain why LDL oxidation occurs in these lesions...|$|R

We used partially melted DNA molecules in which the size of the melted regions and their location were known. They were obtained through glyoxal treatment of the melted regions by a procedure allowing the denatured state to be fixed at any point within the melting range. The approach and the availability of the melting maps of DNAs made it possible to investigate DNA molecules differing in length and {{in the size of the}} melted regions. The presence of a denatured region at the end of the molecule or inside of it was shown to decrease its <b>electrophoretic</b> mobility, the <b>effect</b> depending on the size of the melted region and on the DNA length. On the basis of the experimental results an explanation is proposed for the cause of retardation in the case of partially denatured DNA...|$|R

40|$|Continuum {{simulation}} {{is employed}} to study ion transport and fluid flow through a nanopore in a solid-state membrane under an applied potential drop. Results show {{the existence of}} concentration polarization layers on the surfaces of the membrane. The nonuniformity of the ionic distribution gives rise to an electric pressure that drives vortical motion in the fluid. There is also a net hydrodynamic flow through the nanopore due to an asymmetry induced by the membrane surface charge. The qualitative behavior {{is similar to that}} observed in a previous study using molecular dynamic simulations. The current [...] voltage characteristics show some nonlinear features but are not greatly affected by the hydrodynamic flow in the parameter regime studied. In the limit of thin Debye layers, the electric resistance of the system can be characterized using an equivalent circuit with lumped parameters. Generation of vorticity can be understood qualitatively from elementary considerations of the Maxwell stresses. However, the flow strength is a strongly nonlinear function of the applied field. Combination of <b>electrophoretic</b> and hydrodynamic <b>effects</b> can lead to ion selectivity in terms of valences and this could have some practical applications in separations.
