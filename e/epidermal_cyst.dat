40|$|<b>Epidermal</b> <b>cysts</b> {{represent}} {{the most common}} cutaneous cysts.

The term infundibular cyst {{refers to the}} site of origin of the cyst: the infundibular portion of the hair follicle. In fact, the majority of epidermal inclusion cysts originate from the infundibular portion of the hair follicle thus explaining the interchangeable, yet inaccurate, use of these two terms.

40|$|Background <b>Epidermal</b> <b>cysts</b> are {{commonly}} occurring masses usually less than 5 cm in diameter, but in predisposed patients, <b>epidermal</b> <b>cysts</b> can grow relatively large due to chronic infection. Methods From June 2002 to July 2010, 17 patients received 19 regional perforator-based island flaps to cover defects {{due to the}} excision of large <b>epidermal</b> <b>cysts</b> (diameter > 5 cm) in the buttocks. Eight patients had diabetes, and seven had rheumatoid arthritis. The pedicles were not fully isolated to prevent spasms or twisting. Results All the flaps survived completely, except for one case with partial necrosis of the flap, which necessitated another perforator-based island flap for coverage. There were two cases of wound dehiscence, which were re-closed after meticulous debridement. There were no recurrences of the masses during follow-up periods of 8. 1 months (range, 6 - 12 months).

The thin-layer chromatography was used for detection of cholesterol ester, triglyceride, free fatty acids, cholesterol and phospholipids. Fatty acid components of some lipids were converted to methyl esters and confirmed by gas-liquid chromatography (GLC). The fatty acid compositions of scale and an <b>epidermal</b> <b>cyst</b> of psoriatic patient revealed smaller amount of C 18 : 0 and greater amount of C 18 : 1 and C 18 : 2 than those of clavus horny layer and an <b>epidermal</b> <b>cyst</b> of normal volunteers.

40|$|Background: Inflamed <b>epidermal</b> <b>cysts</b> {{are common}} {{clinical}} conditions, and they frequently form abscesses. We designed {{a study to}} delineate the bacteriology of inflamed <b>epidermal</b> <b>cysts.</b> Methods: We enrolled 61 adult patients with inflamed <b>epidermal</b> <b>cysts</b> characterized by surface erythema, with or without tenderness, or localized abscess formation within the cyst cavity. Incision and drainage of the cysts were performed, and the contents were sent for aerobic and anaerobic bacterial culture. The locations of the cyst and culture results were recorded for statistical analysis. Results: A total of 61 cysts and 122 cultures were obtained. The most common locations of the inflamed cysts were the face, neck, and scalp (34. 4 %), followed by the trunk (32. 8 %), then the buttocks, inguinal areas, perineum, and axillae (16. 4 %), and the extremities (16. 4 %). The culture results were positive in 88. 5 % of patients, and anaerobes were more frequently isolated than were aerobes. Pure aerobes represented 31. 1 % of the cultures; pure anaerobes, 36. 1 %, and combined aerobes and anaerobes, 21. 3 % (n = 13). The most common anaerobic organisms found were Propionibacterium spp (40. 8 %), followed by Peptostreptococcus spp (36. 7 %), Staphylococcus saccharolyticus (14. 4 %), Prevotella (4. 1 %), Bacteroides fragilis (2. 0 %), and Fusobacterium spp (2. 0 %). The most commonly isolated aerobes were Staphylococcus spp (40 %), followed by Enterobacter spp (11. 3 %), Proteus mirabilis (8. 5 %), Citrobacter diversus (8. 5 %), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5. 7 %), Corynebacterium (5. 7 %), Morganella morganii (2. 9 %), Enterococcus faecalis (2. 9 %), group A β-hemolytic streptococcus (2. 9 %), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2. 9 %), and Providencia rettgeri (2. 9 %). Conclusions: Both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms {{were present in the}} inflamed <b>epidermal</b> <b>cysts,</b> although the anaerobic bacteria, specifically, Propionibacterium spp and Peptostreptococcus spp, were isolated slightly more frequently.

40|$|Abstract. Conventional {{epidermal}} cysts {{are generally}} small, slow-growing, non-tender, dome-shaped lesions.

The present case reports a giant <b>epidermal</b> <b>cyst</b> in the posterior neck, which grew to an extremely large size for> 40 years without inflammation or rupture, and was misdiagnosed as a large soft tissue neoplasm. The patient exhibited depression and developed social anxiety due to the negative cosmetic consequences of the large mass. The patient underwent excision of the mass. At the follow-up examination two years postoperatively, there were no local recurrence and the psychi atric symptoms of the patient were completely resolved.
