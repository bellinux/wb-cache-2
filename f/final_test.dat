5|$|On 26 January 2008 {{during the}} 4th and <b>final</b> <b>Test</b> of the 2007–08 series against India, Gilchrist {{announced}} that he would retire from international cricket {{at the end of the}} season. A back injury kept Ricky Ponting off the field for sections of the Indian's second innings, resulting in Gilchrist captaining the team for the part of final two days of his Test cricket career. India batted out the match for a draw, so Gilchrist's 14 in the first innings was his <b>final</b> <b>Test</b> innings; he took his 379th and final catch when Virender Sehwag was caught behind. Gilchrist had scored only 150 runs at 21.42 in his <b>final</b> <b>Test</b> series.|$|E

5|$|According to Bradman, Fingleton and O'Reilly, Lindwall's {{performance}} in the <b>final</b> <b>Test</b> at The Oval {{was one of the}} best they had ever seen from any player. English skipper Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch, surprising most observers. The damp conditions necessitated the addition of large amounts of sawdust to allow the players to keep their grip. Along with the rain, humidity assisted the bowlers, particularly Lindwall, who managed to make the ball bounce at variable heights.|$|E

He had little success in his first tour match, taking 1/64 and 1/53 against Australian A. He played in the <b>final</b> <b>Test</b> at the Sydney Cricket Ground when India fielded two spinners for {{the only time in}} the series.

5|$|Barnes {{injured his}} hand during fielding {{practice}} before the Third Test, {{and although he}} went on to play in that game (scoring 45 and 32), he opted out of batting in a state game – according to his autobiography, this cost him the New South Wales captaincy – and he missed the fourth Test. He returned for the <b>final</b> <b>Test</b> and top-scored with 71 in Australia's first innings, adding 30 in the second.|$|E
5|$|He then scored 73 run out, {{his only}} fifty in the Tests, as Australia made 491 and ceded a 136-run {{lead in the}} third Test at Old Trafford. However, they held on for a draw. Woodfull made a duck in the fourth Test at Headingley, but another Bradman triple century put them in control before rain {{shortened}} the match; England still needed 155 runs to make Australia bat again with only four wickets in hand when the match ended. The draw meant that the series was at 1–1 heading into the <b>final</b> <b>Test</b> at The Oval, which would be timeless.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the home side's 138, Hassett top-scored with 68 in Australia's first innings of 254 before being trapped leg before wicket by Eric Hollies as the tourists defeated Warwickshire by nine wickets.

The feat earned him selection for the Fifth Test, where he dismissed Bradman in his <b>final</b> <b>Test</b> innings for a duck.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The aim of {{the study}} is to {{highlight}} methodological issues on the back muscle strength development by combining methodological procedures in masses bodybuilding. Methods. The study was conducted in three stages over a period of two months (March-April 2011), performing three workouts per week, monitoring the effective use of strength exercises to develop back muscles in the same muscle area by means of giant sets during workouts. In this context, we conducted a case study in "Tonik Fitness Club" in Bucharest, applied to two athletes of 28 and 34 years old. We recorded subjects’ evolutions during the training session, using statistical and mathematical method and graphical representation method. Results. The study content highlights the training programs depending on muscle zone and the specific methodological aspects, the weekly training program per muscle groups, the stages of study carrying out, the test and control trials applied in terms of anthropometric measurements and of back muscle strength development, and the application of the methodical procedure of effort load increase and decrease within the giant sets in a training micro-cycle. Discussion. The study focused on the training programs over two months, monitoring statistically the development of back muscle strength through the application of the procedure of effort load increase and decrease during giant sets in bodybuilding for masses. From the analysis of training programs content we noticed that three giant sets of exercises were used, performed in four series; each exercise within the giant sets was applied by means of the procedure of increasing and decreasing effort load. Study results emphasize the anthropometric measurement results: the study subjects have the age mean of 24. 75, with a size of 175. 2 cm and a weight of 83. 75 kg at initial testing and a decrease by 2. 12 kg in <b>final</b> <b>testing.</b> Regarding the chest perimeter, the inspiration is averaging 89. 5 in initial testing and an increase of 2. 25 cm in final testing; the expiration is averaging 85. 25 cm in initial testing and an increase of 1. 75 cm in <b>final</b> <b>testing,</b> while the amplitude has an average of 4. 25 cm at initial testing and an increase of 1. 0 cm at <b>final</b> <b>testing.</b> As for arms perimeter, at the initial testing of the right arm they had an average of 38. 25 cm and 0. 65 cm increase in <b>final</b> <b>testing,</b> the left arm - an average of 38. 88 cm at initial testing and an increase by 0. 12 cm in <b>final</b> <b>testing.</b> From the analysis of back muscle strength, it was noticed an increase by 4. 5 reps in "pull-downs" <b>final</b> <b>testing,</b> an increase by 16 kg of the load in " cable machine chest pull-downs ", with an average of 84 kg at initial testing and 100 kg in <b>final</b> <b>testing,</b> performed with 13 reps at initial testing and a decrease by 4 reps in <b>final</b> <b>testing.</b> In "seated rowing at machine" there is an increase of the average by 16 kg of load, with an average of 92 kg at initial testing and an average of 108 kg in <b>final</b> <b>testing,</b> with 11 reps performed in initial testing and a decrease by 2 reps in <b>final</b> <b>testing.</b> Conclusions. The study results show that the regular exercising leads to a decrease of body weight, an increase of thoracic amplitude, of arms perimeters and last, but not least, to strength development per different muscle groups. The study highlights methodological issues on the back muscles strength development by combining methodological procedures in bodybuilding for masses, by increasing and decreasing effort load during giant sets. And the effective use of strength exercises for back on the same muscle area by means of giant sets during a training session helps to improve muscle endurance and to increase strength at different machines. Also the division of back muscles areas during each training micro-cycle emphasizes the dynamics of muscle strength and the possibility to combine muscle groups together during a training mezzo-cycle...|$|R
