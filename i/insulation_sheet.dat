40|$|The aim of {{the project}} {{is to develop a}} passive solar heating system with a higher {{efficiency}} (regarding accumulation and transfer of solar heat into dwellings) than convential concrete thermal storage walls and with restricted extra costs for manufacturing the system. This is to be achieved by the introduction of three special components: a. a heat pipe as a thermal diode tube for efficient transfer of collected solar heat from the absorber to the back of an insulation layer b. a heat storage section with water or phase-change material c. an extra <b>insulation</b> <b>sheet</b> with vents between the storage and the room for controlled transfer of heat into the room. Additional advantegeous characteristics of such a system are that the maintenance costs are negligable and the performance is not affected by inadequate control. Series of measurements on single components and computer experiments have been carried out and these have led to the expectation that a high performance can be achieved. The predicted costs, however, are still too high to be cost effective...|$|E
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{an investigation}} of the thermal issues related to the National Ignition Facility. In particular, the influences of the HVAC system and lighting fixtures on the operational performance of the laser guide beam tubes are reviewed and discussed. An analytical model of the oscillating HVAC air temperatures in the NIF switchyard and target bay will cause significant amounts of beam distortion. However, these negative effects can be drastically reduced by adding thermal insulation to the outside of the beam tubes. A computational fluid dynamics model and an analytical investigation found that the light-fixture to beam-tube separation distance must be on the order of 5. 7 m (18. 7 ft) to maintain acceptable beam operating performance in the current NIF design. By reducing the fluorescent light fixture power by 33 % this separation distance can be reduced to 3. 5 m (11. 5 ft). If in addition, thermal insulation with a reflective aluminum foil covering is added to the outside of the beam tubes, the separation distance can be reduced further to 1. 6 m (5. 2 ft). A 1. 27 cm (0. 5 in.) rigid foam <b>insulation</b> <b>sheet</b> with aluminum foil covering will provide adequate insulation for the beam tubes in the NIF switchyards and target bay.

25|$|Most {{polystyrene}} {{products are}} currently not recycled {{due to the}} lack of incentive to invest in the compactors and logistical systems required. Due to the low density of polystyrene foam, it is not economical to collect. However, if the waste material goes through an initial compaction process, the material changes density from typically 30kg/m3 to 330kg/m3 and becomes a recyclable commodity of high value for producers of recycled plastic pellets. Expanded polystyrene scrap can be easily added to products such as EPS <b>insulation</b> <b>sheets</b> and other EPS materials for construction applications; many manufacturers cannot obtain sufficient scrap because of collection issues. When it is not used to make more EPS, foam scrap can be turned into products such as clothes hangers, park benches, flower pots, toys, rulers, stapler bodies, seedling containers, picture frames, and architectural molding from recycled PS.

40|$|In many {{technical}} {{devices such}} as transformers and electrical machines, large differences in geometric dimensions are observed. As a consequence, the generation of a 3 D computational grid for the whole device leads to unacceptably large numbers of elements or can even fail. In addition to the commonly applied cartesian or cylindrical symmetries of the overall geometry, the model can be subdivided into parts featuring translational or cylindrical symmetries. Such parts are discretised separately, accounting for the local symmetry, and are then combined with the surrounding 3 D model. Excitations and boundary conditions of the submodels are not necessarily symmetric but {{are expected to be}} smooth {{in the direction of the}} symmetry. Then, the field distribution at the interface is well approximated by a set of spectral elements along the dimension of symmetry. Coupling between the model parts is carried out by means of Lagrange multipliers. A single-phase transformer with thin <b>insulation</b> <b>sheets</b> is taken as an example to illustrate the proposed hybrid discretisation. The cross-section of the cylindrically symmetric part containing thin sheets, is represented by a fine 2 D finite-element mesh so that all the geometrical details can be resolved, and the rest of the structure is discretised by a 3 D mesh. Nevertheless, a fully 3 D field distribution is calculated in all model parts. Only a small number of harmonic functions is needed to account for the azimuthal field variation at the cylindrical interface. Hence, the number of unknowns in the numerical model is reduced significantly, while a high level of accuracy is maintained. status: publishe...|$|R

The research is based on the modeling pattern limiting the air temperature values on the premises during the heating period and reducing the energy demand for its heating through the employment of a heat exchanger. The findings prove that the analysis of micro-climatic parameters of buildings would benefit from the comprehensive and integrated assessment of the values of thermal comfort indexes PMV and PPD and from the evaluation of thermal insulation properties of clothes. Moreover, the findings demonstrate the need for development of national standards of the microclimate inside residential buildings. The research was based on the data simulating the climatic conditions in the northern region of Tajikistan during an extremely hot summer season and the optimum indoor air temperature of + 24, 3 °C instead of 20 — 22 °C.

This system was correct according to the norm NBE-CT- 79, {{but it has been}} shown that it is insufficient to reach the levels of habitability and the comfort of the current society. The two façades, as well as their adjacent living spaces, have been monitored over a period of two years. Internal and external temperature and humidity, solar radiation, air velocity in the ventilated chamber and surface temperature of each of the material layers of the sections have been obtained. A thermographic study of the two chambers was carried out to determine the thermal bridges and the air infiltration. Through the use of energy simulation tools, comparative results of some parameters have been obtained in both constructive solutions, such as thermal transmissions, average radiant temperatures, operating temperatures or energy demands. By that, we can obtain the conclusions of thermal comfort levels and energy savings of ventilated façades...|$|R
