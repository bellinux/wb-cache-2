In parallel with {{the removal of the}} FAB containing subunit C the reduction kinetics of P 700 + changed from a half life of about 25 ms to about 750 μs. The partner of P 700 + in the 750 μs charge recombination was identified to be FX by the difference spectrum of this phase. There are some minor differences in the spectra of trimeric and monomeric PS I core complexes. At 77 K the <b>forward</b> electron <b>transfer</b> from A − 1 to FX is blocked in the major fraction of the PS I core complexes and P 700 +A− 1 recombines with a half life of about 220 μs.
