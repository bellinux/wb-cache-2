40|$|SummaryObjectiveArticular chondrocytes {{respond to}} {{chemical}} and mechanical signals {{depending on their}} zone of origin with respect to distance from the tissue surface. However, little is known of the zonal variations in cellular mechanical properties in cartilage. The goal {{of this study was}} to determine the zonal variations in the elastic and viscoelastic properties of porcine chondrocytes using atomic force microscopy (AFM), and to validate this method against micropipette aspiration. MethodsA theoretical solution for stress relaxation of a viscoelastic, incompressible, isotropic surface indented with a hard, spherical <b>indenter</b> (<b>5</b> μm diameter) was derived and fit to experimental stress-relaxation data for AFM indentation of chondrocytes isolated from the superficial or middle/deep zones of cartilage. ResultsThe instantaneous moduli of chondrocytes were 0. 55 ± 0. 23 kPa for superficial cells (S) and 0. 29 ± 0. 14 kPa for middle/deep cells (M/D) (P< 0. 0001), and the relaxed moduli were 0. 31 ± 0. 15 kPa (S) and 0. 17 ± 0. 09 kPa (M/D) (P< 0. 0001). The apparent viscosities were 1. 15 ± 0. 66 kPas (S) and 0. 61 ± 0. 69 kPa-s (M/D) (P< 0. 0001). Results from the micropipette aspiration test showed similar cell moduli but higher apparent viscosities, indicating that mechanical properties measured by these two techniques are similar. ConclusionOur findings suggest that chondrocyte biomechanical properties differ significantly with the zone of origin, consistent with previous studies showing zonal differences in chondrocyte biosynthetic activity and gene expression. Given the versatility and dynamic testing capabilities of AFM, the ability to conduct stress-relaxation measurements using this technique may provide further insight into the viscoelastic properties of isolated cells...|$|R

40|$|Past sensory {{experience}} can influence present perception. We studied {{the effect of}} adaptation in haptic softness perception. Participants compared two silicon rubber stimuli, a reference and a comparison stimulus, by indenting them simultaneously with the index fingers of their two hands and decided which one felt softer. In adaptation conditions the index finger that explored the reference stimulus had previously been adapted to another rubber stimulus. The adaptation stimulus was <b>indented</b> <b>5</b> times with a force of > 15 N, thus the two in-dex fingers had a different sensory past. In baseline conditions there was no previous adaptation. We measured the Points of Subjective Equality (PSEs) of one reference stimulus {{to a set of}} comparison stimuli. We used four different adaptation stimuli, one was harder, two were softer and one had approximately the same compliance as compared to the reference stimulus. PSEs shifted {{as a function of the}} compliance of the adaptation stimulus: the reference was per-ceived to be softer when the finger had been adapted to a harder stimulus and it was perceived to be harder after adaptation to a softer stimulus. We conclude that recent sensory experience causes a shift of haptically perceived softness away from the softness of the adaptation stimulus. The finding that perceived softness is susceptible to adaptation suggests that there might be neural chan-nels tuned to different softness values and softness is an independent primary perceptual quality.

40|$|Monolithic TiN and {{multilayered}} {{structures of}} TiN films that alternate with thin Ti interlayers were coated by filtered arc deposition onto {{a stainless steel}} substrate. Microscratch tests with a diamond <b>indenter</b> of <b>5</b> -μm radius were carried out in combination with focused ion beam (FIB) sectioning and scanning and transmission electron microscopy to explore the controlling deformation mechanisms of these TiN coatings {{in relation to their}} microstructural design. It was found that for the monolithic TiN coating, columnar TiN grains slid against each other under normal forces and, at the same time, tilted under tangential forces. For the TiN multilayers, however, intercolumnar shear sliding was suppressed considerably by the multilayered structure and the interlayers, and grain tilting occurred largely within the upper TiN layer, presumably due to the shear effect of the soft Ti interlayers. With further increases in tangential force, rupture of TiN grains was observed within both types of coatings; for the TiN multilayers, rupture of TiN grains occurred predominantly within the layers close to the steel substrates. It can be concluded that the application of TiN multilayers provides better resistance to contact damage than the traditional monolithic TiN coatings did. Z. H. Xie, M. Hoffman, P. Munroe, R.

40|$|To our knowledge, {{this study}} {{applied for the}} first time a {{recently}} developed combination of atomic force microscopy (AFM) and nanoindentation on trabecular and compact bone tissue. The major aim was to check the advantage of the available AFM-mode over the conventionally used optical microscope. First, we investigated if removal of the water content helped to prevent enzymatic degradation of the bone tissue and preserve its mechanical properties during a week. After the positive issue of this test, we quantified the intrinsic mechanical properties of single bone structural units (BSU). Bone specimens were obtained from the femoral neck of an 86 year old female. Four BSU were randomly selected and tested each with 24 <b>indents</b> of <b>5</b> mN maximum force. The available AFM mode proved to be a very useful tool for surface characterization and precise selection of the indentation area. The elastic modulus ranged from 18 ± 1. 7 GPa for a BSU of compact bone to 22. 5 ± 3. 1 GPa for a BSU of trabecular bone. Hardness showed values between 0. 6 ± 0. 11 GPa for compact bone and 1. 1 ± 0. 17 GPa for trabecular bone.

40|$|Objective: As resin-modified {{glass-ionomer cement}} (RMGIC) is an {{adhesive}} material, its association to dentin bonding agents (DBAs) was previously proposed. This {{study investigated the}} adjunctive behavior of an RMGIC with etch-and-rinse bonding systems under in situ/ex vivo cariogenic challenge. Method and Materials: Bovine enamel blocks (3 3 2 mm) {{were randomly assigned to}} group VP, Vitremer + its own primer (3 M ESPE); group VSB, Vitremer + Single Bond (3 M ESPE); and group VPB, Vitremer + Prime & Bond 2. 1 (Dentsply). Two blocks of each group were randomly placed in an acrylic palatal appliance, so each appliance included six blocks. Volunteers (n = 10) wore these appliances according to given instructions to promote a sucrose challenge eight times/day for 15 days. After this period, the blocks were removed from the devices and cleaned, and demineralization was assessed through longitudinal microhardness analysis (Knoop <b>indenter,</b> 25 g/ <b>5</b> s). Data were submitted to three-way ANOVA and Tukey test (P <. 05). Results: No treatment was able to completely avoid demineralization. All materials showed a statistically significant difference in mineral loss when the microhardness on the outer enamel was compared with deeper regions (P <. 05).

It also aims to determine potential damage mechanisms to the wire during bending process for electric motor coils. In this investigation a wire-bending machine was designed and built in order to simulate the wire forming process in a laboratory scale. Bending angle of the wire and the bending radii were used to control the strain on the wire surface. The effect of speed on COF was investigated for different speeds of of 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 mm/s. A positive correlation was observed between the COF and the testing speed. Additionally, the effect of strain on COF was studied for 2 % and 23 % to determine its influence on the COF.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{correlate}} the local tissue mineral density (TMD) with the bone tissue stiffness. It was hypothesized that these variables are positively correlated. Cancellous and cortical bone samples were derived from ten mandibular condyles taken from 5 young and 5 adult female pigs. The bone tissue stiffness was assessed in three directions using nanoindentation. At each of three tested sides <b>5</b> <b>indents</b> were made over the width of 5 single bone elements, resulting in a total number of 1500 indents. MicroCT was used to determine the local TMD at the indented sites. The TMD and the bone tissue stiffness were higher in bone from the adult animals than from the young ones, but did not differ between cancellous and cortical bone. In the adult group, both the TMD and the bone tissue stiffness were higher in the center than at the surface of the bone elements. The mean TMD, thus ignoring the local mineral distribution, had a coefficient of determination (R 2) with the mean bone tissue stiffness of 0. 55, p < 0. 05, whereas the correlation between local bone tissue stiffness and the concomitant TMD appeared to be weak (R 2 0. 07, p < 0. 001).

On the basis of researches the previously obtained microhardness redistribution effect in the area of welded connection after ET was confirmed. As a result of use of the indicated treatment it was determined not only the reduction of microhardness gradient but also the simultaneous hardening effect in the certain thermal affected areas near the welding seam. During study of chemical composition of phase constituents it was discovered, that the structural changes of alloy as a result of ET first of all are caused by the redistribution of chemical elements, which form the connections themselves. By the nature of the influence the indicated treatment can be comparable with the thermal softening technologies of metallic materials. Originality. The observed structural changes of alloy and related to them microhardness change in the areas near the welding seam after ET are conditioned by both the change of morphology of structural constituents and the redistribution of chemical elements. In case of invariability of chemical elements correlation in the phase constituents of alloy the reduction effect of gradient microhardness should be far less. Practical value.

40|$|DLC {{coatings}} {{can combine}} high hardness with low friction. However, {{they are often}} deposited {{with high levels of}} intrinsic stress and display low adhesion strength resulting in poor performance in demanding applications. A highly topical challenge is to develop advanced DLC coatings capable of withstanding more demanding applications in the automotive, cutting tool, MEMS and oil and gas sectors. The results from several nanomechanical and tribological test techniques – nanoindentation, nano-scratch and nano-fretting (nano-wear) – can be used together to aid the design of DLC coating architectures for enhanced durability in specific applications. In this study the behaviour of multilayered DLC coatings (Cr/W–C:H/a-C:H, Cr/W–C:H/Si–a-C:H) was compared to that of CrN/a-C:H:W (WC/C). We have previously reported that in nano-wear tests the coating with the highest hardness and H/E displayed greater wear resistance [T. W. Liskiewicz et al., Surf. Coat. Technol. 237 (2013) 212]. By employing nano- and micro-scale tribological testing with probes of differing sharpness it is possible to change the sensitivity of the test to probe the response of the coating top layer or the entire multilayer coating–substrate system. In the nano-scratch tests using a spherical <b>indenter</b> with a <b>5</b> μm end radius the maximum stresses are located well within the top layer of the multilayer coatings and consequently the mechanical properties of this top layer dominate the nano-tribological behaviour. In the micro-scratch using a 25 μm spherical probe the stress field extends further towards the sub-layers and steel substrate and consequently the behaviour is completely different. Under these conditions the coating with the lowest hardness and H/E showed improved performance with higher critical loads for cracking and total coating failure. High resolution SEM imaging has been used to investigate this further. A simple contact model strongly suggests that cracking and failure events occur on the harder coatings when the maximum von Mises stress was located close to the interfaces in the multilayer systems...|$|R
40|$|This master {{thesis is}} a part of a European {{research}} project named “Prolonging life time of old steel and steel-concrete bridges” or simply “PROLIFE”. As the name indicates the purpose is to strengthen existing bridges. The part of the project that this thesis deals with is developing and testing a new innovative friction grip connection being used to connect a truss with the bottom flanges of beams in order to make two or more beams to act like a steel box girder. The thesis also evaluates the friction grip connection experimentally at the research facility Complab, the largest laboratory at Luleå University of Technology. By increasing the effective friction coefficient the entire friction connection can withstand larger shear forces. The hypothesis is to increase the friction coefficient between the plates in a lap connection by inserting small indenters between the plates. In this thesis three types of indenters have been used, aluminium oxide, stainless steel and tungsten carbide. All types of indenters have been tested in a compression test between two plates. The aluminium oxide and stainless steel indenter types have also been loaded in shear in a friction connection after compression of the two plates. The necessary pre-load to impress an <b>indenter</b> of 2. <b>5</b> mm in diameter 2. 3 mm into two plates is 11 kN. The remaining 0. 2 mm gap between the plates is due to the crater developed at an impression point. The protruding edges of craters on opposite plates are brought into contact with each other at 2. 3 mm indentation. The aluminium oxide increases friction but the effect is inconsistent and uncertain, since the indenters are crushed and indenting is not identical between different tests. With small indenters made of stainless steel the effective friction coefficient (µ) of the friction connection can also be improved. How much (µ) can be increased by small indenters in a friction connection depends on the existing surface condition or treatment of the plates in a joint. The tests indicate that the effect of the indenters almost equals that of a shot or grit blasted surface with loose rust removed and no pitting. A connection with indenters provides further a certain safety against overloading and the definition of the procedure is unambiguous. In a reference test with just as rolled surface conditions and no indenters, the slip resistance was 54. 5 kN and the effective friction coefficient μ= 0. 09. With 58 indenters and an M 30 bolt with a pre-loading force of 320 kN the slip resistance can be expected to slightly exceed 250 kN and the effective friction coefficient to be somewhat smaller than μ= 0. 40, at the acceptable slip of 0. 15 mm, according to the current Eurocode standard. The slip resistance from the tests with different number of indenters and without indenters is shown in Figure 36 and Figure 37. Without the slip criterion the expected slip resistance for the same configuration can be 310 kN and the effective friction coefficient somewhat smaller than μ= 0. 50. See Figure 39.
