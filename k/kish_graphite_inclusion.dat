The shape change of <b>graphite</b> <b>inclusions</b> and {{components of the}} metal matrix is examined with increasing the reduction ratio from 0 (as-cast state) to 80 %. For the fist time, using the electrochemical etching of the metal matrix of the cast iron, it is demonstrated experimentally that at plastic deformation the ductile flow of <b>graphite</b> <b>inclusions</b> occurs without fracturing of the latter. The surface morphology of a deformed <b>graphite</b> <b>inclusion</b> is revealed.

The fact that the most part of <b>graphite</b> <b>inclusions</b> on the fracture surface of the deformed cast iron appeared undamaged (very small amount of fractured inclusions was observed) testifies against the common opinion that graphite acts as a crack nucleation site.

40|$|The oxidation, {{in a neat}} oxygen atmosphere, of high-purity {{and highly}} {{crystalline}} natural <b>graphite</b> and synthetic <b>Kish</b> <b>graphite</b> was investigated. The physico-geometric model function of the kinetic rate equation was experimentally determined by isothermal thermogravimetric analysis at 650 °C. Analytic solutions for basic flake shapes indicate that this function strictly decreases with conversion. However, for both samples the experimental data trend was a rapid initial increase followed by the expected decrease to zero. High resolution field emission scanning electron microscopy (FEGSEM), of partially oxidized flakes, provided plausible explanations for this discrepancy. Rapid development of macroscopic surface roughness during {{the initial stages of}} oxidation was evident and could be attributed to the presence of catalytic impurities. Large fissures along the planes of the natural graphite and the initiation, growth and coalescence of internal cavities in the <b>Kish</b> <b>graphite</b> were observed.

40|$|During {{the laser}} {{remelting}} {{of cast iron}} the <b>graphite</b> <b>inclusions</b> are dissolved to an extent depending on temperature and time. The surface tension gradient driven convection leads to an almost uniform carbon concentration in the melt which drops within a boundary layer at the liquidlsolid interface to a temperature dependent boundary value determined by the local thermodynamical equilibrium. Therefore, carbon diffusion into the solid de- creases the melting temperature and facilitates melting. The dissolution kinetics of spheri- cal <b>graphite</b> <b>inclusions</b> in the melt pool subjected to body forces (buoyancy or centrifugal forces) is modelled using a semi-analytical approach to the moving boundary problem. Diffusion controlled melting and solidification at a planar front {{as well as at}} dissolving gra- phite particles in a solid environment above 1150 øC were studied numerically. At high feed rates andlor large <b>graphite</b> <b>inclusion</b> spacings a straight sharp boundary of the re- melted zone is fou nd since melting at the planar front dominates. At lower feed rates the melt zone boundary structure is determined by the coalescence of initially isolated molten shells originating at <b>graphite</b> <b>inclusions.</b> The result is a transition zone with mutually more or less interconnected ledeburitic regions at partly or completely dissolved graphite parti- cles.

40|$|III-V {{semiconductor}} nanowire-graphene photovoltaics is {{an emerging}} technology {{that has the}} potential of highly efficient, flexible and ultra-thin solar cells. This thesis has explored aluminum-induced crystallization(AIC) of amorphous silicon on graphene and graphite surfaces, with the aim of increasing the nucleation yield of nanowires. It is demonstrated that thin films of aluminum and amorphous silicon, separated by an oxide membrane, produces [111]-oriented crystalline silicon after annealing at 470 - 500 °C, well below the crystallization temperature of silicon, for glass, <b>kish</b> <b>graphite</b> and graphene substrates. The crystal orientation and elemental composition of the samples are characterized by X-ray diffraction(XRD), electron backscatter diffraction(EBSD) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy(EDX). The crystallized silicon forms semi-continuous films on glass and graphene, while it forms dendrite structures on <b>kish</b> <b>graphite</b> substrates. Silicon crystallization is achieved with both sputtering and electron beam evaporation of aluminum, and it is suggested that the aluminum microstructure is the determining factor for whether silicon crystallization occurs or not. The developed process for AIC of amorphous silicon is combined with the one-shot exposure electron beam lithography(EBL) technique to pattern silicon nanodot arrays on few-layer graphene substrates, showing high yields and controllable dot diameter sizes of 80 - 160 nm. The processes developed in this thesis would have a high potential for the high-density nucleation of vertically aligned, self-catalyzed gallium arsenide(GaAs) nanowires on graphene, enabling the fabrication of an ultra-thin solar cell with GaAs nanowires as the photoactive component and graphene as the bottom electrode...|$|R
