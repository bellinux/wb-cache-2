50|$|Slick tyres are not {{suitable}} for use on common road vehicles, which {{must be able to}} operate in all weather conditions. They are used in auto racing where competitors can choose different tyres based on the weather conditions and can often change tyres during a race. Slick tyres provide far more traction than <b>grooved</b> <b>tyres</b> on dry roads, due to their greater contact area but typically have far less traction than <b>grooved</b> <b>tyres</b> under wet conditions. Wet roads severely diminish the traction because of aquaplaning due to water trapped between the tyre contact area and the road surface. <b>Grooved</b> <b>tyres</b> are designed to remove water from the contact area through the grooves, thereby maintaining traction even in wet conditions.|$|R
50|$|The 2009 season saw the re-introduction of slick <b>tyres</b> {{replacing}} the <b>grooved</b> <b>tyres</b> used from 1998 to 2008.|$|R
50|$|It {{was also}} notable {{for being the}} only season that GP2 used <b>grooved</b> <b>tyres</b> like F1 cars rather than slicks.|$|R
50|$|When the 1998 season {{got under}} way four months later {{it became clear that}} Newey had adapted to the rule changes for 1998 best. With the cars now {{narrower}} and running on <b>grooved</b> <b>tyres,</b> the MP4/13 was the car to beat.|$|R
5000|$|Its {{front axle}} and {{steering}} had been re-designed to reduce [...] "bump-steer"and its radiator capacity increased. <b>Grooved</b> <b>tyres</b> were now supplied at the rear. The banjo back axle {{was no longer}} welded but built up from three pieces and its springs were now slung below it.|$|R
5000|$|The 1998 season {{brought about}} two {{significant}} technical changes to reduce cornering speeds and aid overtaking. The {{first was the}} reduction of the cars' track, from 2 m to 1.8 m, making them much narrower than in 1997; a previous reduction in track occurred in , when the cars were reduced from 2.15 m to 2 m. The second was the introduction of <b>grooved</b> <b>tyres</b> to replace slicks: the front <b>tyres</b> had three <b>grooves,</b> with four on the rear <b>tyres.</b> <b>Grooved</b> <b>tyres</b> would remain in Formula One until the reintroduction of slicks in [...] For 1998, both McLaren and Benetton switched from Goodyear to Bridgestone tyres, as the Japanese manufacturer expanded to work with six of the eleven teams in their second year competing in the sport. This would result in the two teams who became principal championship protagonists working with different tyre manufacturers. The two top teams from 1997, Williams and Ferrari, opted to retain Goodyear tyres.|$|R
5000|$|This was {{the last}} season for the Honda team before they pulled out of F1 later in December due to the global {{economic}} crisis. Then, Ross Brawn bought the team and renamed it to Brawn GP in February [...] using the Mercedes-Benz engines. This was also the last Formula One season to race with <b>grooved</b> <b>tyres,</b> used since , before slick tyres returned to Formula One in [...]|$|R
50|$|Privateers Cup {{cars were}} {{restricted}} to <b>grooved</b> Pirelli <b>tyres,</b> whereas Outright Class cars could use slick tyres.|$|R
5000|$|Goodyear, who had {{supplied}} Williams, Ferrari, Jordan, Sauber and Tyrrell throughout 1998, left Formula One {{at the end}} of the season, leaving Bridgestone as {{the only}} <b>tyre</b> supplier. The <b>grooved</b> <b>tyres</b> introduced in 1998 now had four grooves on all tyres; the front tyres previously had three. Wheels also were required to be tethered to the chassis in order to prevent them flying off in a crash, a feature which remains in place as of [...]|$|R
5000|$|In [...] <b>grooved</b> <b>tyres</b> were {{introduced}} with three grooves {{in the front}} <b>tyres</b> and four <b>grooves</b> in the rear tyres. Between [...] and , regulations required the tyres to feature a minimum of four grooves in them, {{with the intention of}} slowing the cars down (a slick tyre, with no indentations, is best in dry conditions). They could be no wider than 355 mm at the front and 380 mm at the rear, and the maximum diameter was 660 mm, or 670 mm for wet tyres. Slick tyres were reintroduced at the beginning of , along with aerodynamic changes intended to shift the balance towards mechanical grip in an attempt to increase overtaking.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the deaths}} of Senna and Ratzenberger, the FIA has used safety {{as a reason to}} impose rule changes that otherwise, under the Concorde Agreement, would have had to be agreed upon by all the teams — most notably the changes {{introduced}} for 1998. This so-called 'narrow track' era resulted in cars with smaller rear tyres, a narrower track overall, and the introduction of <b>grooved</b> <b>tyres</b> to reduce mechanical grip. There were to be four grooves on the front (three in the first year) and rear that ran through the entire circumference of the tyre. The objective was to reduce cornering speeds and to produce racing similar to rainy conditions by enforcing a smaller contact patch between tyre and track. This, according to the FIA, was to promote driver skill and provide a better spectacle.Results have been mixed as the lack of mechanical grip has resulted in the more ingenious designers clawing back the deficit with aerodynamic grip — pushing more force onto the tyres through wings and aerodynamic devices, which in turn has resulted in less overtaking as these devices tend to make the wake behind the car 'dirty' (turbulent), preventing other cars from following closely due to their dependence on 'clean' air to make the car stick to the track. The <b>grooved</b> <b>tyres</b> also had the unfortunate side effect of initially being of a harder compound to be able to hold the grooved tread blocks, which resulted in spectacular accidents in times of aerodynamic grip failure as the harder compound could not grip the track as well.|$|R
5000|$|The F1600 is an {{entry-level}} single seater {{modeled after}} the popular Formula Ford. In spite of the small powerplant, its lightweight construction allows for high performance. In v1.1 slicks were removed as a setup option for this car, and only <b>grooved</b> <b>tyres</b> can be fitted: according to Stefano Casillo, the car has too little power to be fun when driven on slicks. As of April 2010, {{this is the only}} car available to demo (unlicensed) users. Casillo had once expressed the will to replace the F1600 with another entry-level single seater with downforce, which would have been easier to drive. However, a recently published interview shows Casillo has apparently changed his mind on the subject.|$|R

5000|$|The sport's sole tyre supplier, Bridgestone, {{provided}} two specifications of <b>grooved</b> dry <b>tyres</b> for the race, designated Soft (also {{referred to}} as the [...] "prime" [...] tyre) and Super Soft (also {{referred to as}} the [...] "option" [...] tyre). The Super Soft compound was distinguished by a white stripe in one of the <b>tyre's</b> <b>grooves.</b> As was the case for all of the 2008 Grands Prix, the rules stipulated that all cars should use both types of tyre {{during the course of the}} race, and each driver was limited to seven sets of dry tyres for the weekend.|$|R

5000|$|Since {{completely}} slick tyres are outlawed on most roads due {{to their}} inability to handle wet pavement, the [...] "cheater slick" [...] became a popular item in the hot rod world in the 1960s; a typical slick type tyre, but engraved with the absolute minimal amount of tread grooves required to satisfy legal requirements. Since then, however, tyre development has progressed greatly, so that today's hot rod street cars typically use wide, <b>grooved</b> <b>tyres</b> which perform better than the slicks of the past; while the cheater slicks available today, both for nostalgic appearance of street cars and for competition use in classes where DOT approved street tyres are required, have followed their own line of development, diverging from true slick tyre construction to become a distinct tyre design in themselves.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} process of a tyre usually involves {{a combination of}} simulation and testing techniques focused on characterizing acoustic/aerodynamic and vibrational phenomena. One of the acoustic phenomenon of interest is the absorption of the tyre, which affects the sound radiated. This properties is mainly related to local resonant effects, which can be changed by modifying the geometry of the tyre tread. A procedure is presented to determine the attenuation achieved due {{to a change in}} tyre tread configuration. The acoustic transfer path is measured from sound produced at one side of the tyre pavement contact area to the other. A miniature microphone and a small monopole with a known output have been developed to allow measurements inside the <b>tyre</b> <b>grooves.</b> <b>Tyre</b> sections with a circumferential groove only, as well as sections with additional side branches, have been evaluated...|$|R
25|$|The cars use 18-inch control wheels, {{produced}} by Rimstock and supplied by Racer Industries, and control tyres from Dunlop. The slick tyre {{is available in}} both hard and soft compounds, with teams required to use either or both compounds in each race, depending on the event. A <b>grooved</b> wet <b>tyre</b> is used in damp conditions.|$|R
25|$|Further, from 1995 {{designs were}} {{required}} {{to be drawn from}} a reference plane (template), and strict limitations were enforced as to the minimum and maximum tolerances for aspects of the vehicle such as the size of the cockpit opening (an idea well known in Champ Car for a decade) and of aerodynamic devices, commonly called wings. Further, maximum engine displacement was reduced from 3.5 litres to 3 litres. Further changes were mandated as the FIA continued to try to curb the increase in speeds of Formula One cars as the years progressed. These changes included the increase in size of the cockpit opening (to ensure driver egress was easy and to minimise possible side head impacts), introducing <b>grooved</b> <b>tyres</b> (to reduce cornering speeds by reducing grip) and narrower bodywork (this would complicate cooling and also reduce cornering speed), raising and reducing wing sizes and elements (cutting aerodynamic downforce, thus reducing cornering speed), and introducing comprehensive checks on stiffness tolerances and measurements to ensure cars conformed completely with the regulations (for example, weight tests on wings and bodywork to ensure that they maintained integrity and did not flex to give an aerodynamic advantage in a straight line).|$|R
500|$|After {{the deaths}} of drivers Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, {{worldwide}} media attention focused on the charismatic triple-world champion Senna, rather than Ratzenberger, a virtual unknown driving for the minor Simtek team. Mosley {{did not go to}} Senna's funeral, but attended that of Ratzenberger. In a press conference 10years later Mosley said, [...] "I went to his funeral because everyone went to Senna's. I thought it was important that somebody went to his." [...] In the aftermath of the deaths, {{and a number of other}} serious accidents, Mosley announced the formation of the Advisory Expert Group chaired by Professor Sid Watkins, to research and improve safety in motor racing. Watkins, who learned of his new role by hearing Mosley announce it on the radio, has called it a [...] "novel and revolutionary approach". The resulting changes included reducing the capacity and power of engines, the use of <b>grooved</b> <b>tyres</b> to reduce cornering speeds, the introduction of the HANS device to protect drivers' necks in accidents, circuit re-design and greatly increased requirements for crash testing of chassis. Mosley was criticised for some of the very rapid changes announced in the immediate aftermath of the deaths at the San Marino race.|$|R
50|$|The Benetton B197 had a lacklustre {{opening to}} the 1997 season at Melbourne but the team and Berger bounced back at the 1997 Brazilian Grand Prix, with Berger {{finishing}} second having overtaken Mika Häkkinen and Michael Schumacher. Berger then scored Benetton's final Grand Prix victory {{at the age of}} 37, again at Hockenheim, coming back after a 3 race layoff following illness and {{the death of his father}} in an aeroplane crash. As well as the victory, Berger also claimed pole position and fastest lap during the 1997 German Grand Prix. He announced his decision to leave Benetton at the end of the season during the same weekend. He eventually retired at the end of the season, his final race seeing him finish a very close fourth in Jerez only seconds behind the victor Mika Häkkinen. In his final season as a Formula One driver, Berger and Alesi out-qualified each other 7 times each with the Austrian missing three races due to illness. Rumours of a Ferrari return for 1998 were false. Sauber offered Berger a drive for 1998, but the Austrian turned down the offer for a number of reasons, not least because of the new regulations for <b>grooved</b> <b>tyres</b> which the Austrian did not find inspiring.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{the return}} of slicks at the {{beginning}} of the 2009 season the white stripe to indicate differences between the tyres was no longer possible due to the lack of <b>grooves</b> on the <b>tyres.</b> Subsequently, in a continuation of the Make Cars Green tyres in Japan, Bridgestone painted the sidewalls of the option tyre green instead.|$|R
5000|$|The 20 hp Vitesse Phaeton was {{pictured in}} the same newspaper.

5000|$|The {{changing}} conditions saw the Michelin {{advantage in}} the dry superseded by Bridgestone dominance in the wet. Michelin motorsport director Pierre Dupasquier said: [...] "Today's race was absolutely fascinating from a technical perspective. We set the early pace, and our drivers were the quickest out there when the circuit dried towards the end. In slightly damp conditions, our <b>grooved</b> dry weather <b>tyres</b> enabled our leading drivers to run up to three seconds per lap faster than Michael Schumacher. In wetter conditions, we were losing two seconds per lap." ...|$|R
5000|$|... 1999 : Number of <b>grooves</b> on front <b>tyres</b> {{increased}} {{from three to}} four, flexible wings banned, pit lane shielding standardised, some run off areas to have asphalt instead of sand traps, at least four medical intervention cars and an FIA doctor car required, ADR required to be in operation during testing, wheels must be tethered to car {{to reduce the risk}} of launched components during an accident, rear and lateral headrest assembly made one piece and quick release, engine oil breathers must vent into engine air intake, extractable driver's seat mandatory, frontal impact test speed increased to 13 m/s.|$|R
500|$|The Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the sport's {{governing}} body, {{launched the}} Formula One component of their Make Cars Green campaign at the Japanese Grand Prix. For the weekend, the <b>grooves</b> in the <b>tyres</b> were painted green to promote environmentally friendly driving. FIA president Max Mosley said [...] "The FIA {{is determined to}} ensure that future investment in motor sport will also help drive the development of technologies that will benefit the public at large." [...] As is normal for a Formula One race, Bridgestone brought two different tyre compounds to the race; the softer of the two marked by a single white stripe {{down one of the}} grooves.|$|R
5000|$|For , Bridgestone {{became the}} sole tyre {{supplier}} in Formula One with {{the withdrawal of}} Michelin, and introduced four compounds of tyre, {{two of which are}} made available at each race. The harder tyre (referred to as the [...] "prime" [...] tyre) and is more durable but gives less grip, and the softer tyre (referred to as the [...] "option" [...] tyre) gives more grip but is less durable. Both compounds have to be used by each car during a race and the softer tyre had a painted white stripe in the second groove to distinguish between compounds. This was introduced after the first race of the season when confusion occurred because a small dot was put on the sidewall of the tyre, instead of the white stripe. Upon the reintroduction of slicks in 2009, the sidewalls of the softer tyres were painted green to indicate the difference in compound, as there were no longer any <b>grooves</b> in <b>tyres.</b> Each team must use each specification during the race, unless wet or intermediate tyres are used during the race, in which case this rule no longer applies.|$|R
5000|$|In contrast, many bicycle tyres {{made for}} street use are slick. Aquaplaning does not present {{a problem for}} {{bicycles}} due to their narrower width, higher pressure, lower speed, and circular cross section (due {{to the need to}} lean the bicycle in turns); the bicycle tyre can penetrate the water layer to contact the road much more easily. In practice, <b>grooved</b> bicycle <b>tyres</b> do not outperform slick tyres on wet roads. However, many low and medium performance bicycle tyres have substantial tread depth, because the bicycles are designed with off-road excursions in mind: in dirt, gravel or sand, the tread pattern provides significantly improved traction. In addition, high-performance bicycle tyres, although designed for road use only, often have a very fine tread pattern, which appears to provide no difference in performance versus a slick tyre and is only there for marketing purposes and as a tyre-wear indicator. This is clear not only from direct testing of tyres, but also {{from the fact that the}} texture of the road is itself coarser than the minimal tread pattern on these tyres. Some grooveless designs have small [...] "holes" [...] or dimples embedded in the tread as a tyre-wear indicator. This is similar to automobile tyre-wear indicator bars, which contact the road when the tyre is worn to a low tread amount, making the tyre noisy on the road.|$|R
5000|$|... 2007 : Tuned {{mass damper}} system banned, rev limit of 19,000 rpm introduced, rear wing {{structure}} strengthened to prevent flexing, increased strength required from rear crash structure, single tyre supplier (Bridgestone) after withdrawal of Michelin, revised tyre regulations mean drivers must use both hard and soft compound tyre {{during the course}} of race (soft compound tyres are identified by a white stripe in one of the front <b>tyre</b> <b>grooves),</b> engine development frozen until the end of 2008 to cut costs, further restrictions to regulations means no teams may run a 3rd car on Friday, both sessions on Friday extended to 90 minutes in length, engine changes on first day of practice no longer subject to grid place penalty, pit lane restrictions during any period the safety car is on the track, annual testing limited to 30,000 km to reduce costs.|$|R
5000|$|Following the German Grand Prix on July 20, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} testing sessions at the Jerez circuit from July 22-25. Each team {{was limited to}} 30,000 km of testing during the 2008 calendar year, a reduction compared with previous seasons. Sebastian Vettel (Toro Rosso) set the fastest {{time of the first}} and second days, while Mark Webber (Red Bull) topped the third day's running, and Heikki Kovalainen was fastest {{on the final day of}} testing. Several teams tested using Bridgestone slick tyres, as preparation for the switch from <b>grooved</b> to slick <b>tyres</b> for the 2009 season, and BMW Sauber tested a Kinetic Energy Recovery System, also for the following year. Among the other teams, Force India's test driver, Vitantonio Liuzzi, tested the team's new [...] "seamless-shift" [...] gearbox ahead of the system's race début later in the year, while Timo Glock of Toyota took part after a heavy crash at the German Grand Prix.|$|R
50|$|The time it {{took for}} the rain to arrive and the sheer amount was heavily underestimated by {{everybody}} but Spyker, and so during the first lap it started to rain heavily and people had been caught out. David Coulthard skated across the gravel at turn five as everybody tried to drive around a slow Hamilton {{and there was a}} small impact between Rubens Barrichello and Nico Rosberg at the newly named Schumacher 'S' corner in the mid-field with Barrichello's Honda the worst affected. As Rosberg recovered, he was extremely lucky not to have been clipped by Ralf Schumacher who sped past but the luck did not last and the first lap chaos had not ended there as Adrian Sutil was also caught up with the recovering Rosberg {{towards the end of the}} lap at the back. Alexander Wurz also missed the final chicane after getting two wheels on the soggy grass. Somewhat amazingly, all of the drivers' cars had survived, and they returned to the pit lane at the end of lap one to change from <b>grooved</b> dry <b>tyres</b> to intermediates - though it would later show intermediate tyres were still the wrong tyres to be on. Debutant Markus Winkelhock took advantage of a gamble which meant he started on wet tyres and from the pit lane which gave him a surprising lead at his home Grand Prix after everyone in the field pitted for intermediates or stayed out on dries; the first time that a Spyker had led a Grand Prix. Everyone would have normally pitted at the end of lap one as it was raining heavily but an error from then-leader Kimi Räikkönen resulted in him slipping wide on the paint and he missed the pit entry completely which meant he had to do an extra lap on the dry tyres slipping him to a net seventh place.|$|R
5000|$|In 1993, Mosley {{agreed with}} Balestre that the Frenchman would stand down as {{president}} of the FIA in Mosley's favour, in return for the new role of President of the FIA Senate, to be created after Mosley's election. As well as motorsport, the FIA's remit includes the interests of motorists worldwide, an area in which Mosley wanted to involve himself: [...] "That is what really interested me: F1 you maybe save one life every five years, whereas in road safety you are talking about thousands of lives". A challenge to Mosley's election by Jeffrey Rose, chairman of the British Royal Automobile Club, was withdrawn {{when it became clear that}} the majority of voters were already committed to Mosley. The FISA was then merged into the FIA as its sporting arm. After the deaths of drivers Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, worldwide media attention focused on the charismatic triple-world champion Senna, rather than Ratzenberger, a virtual unknown driving for the minor Simtek team.

Mosley was criticised for some of the very rapid changes announced in the immediate aftermath of the deaths at the San Marino race. In 1995, a deal was signed between Ecclestone and the FIA that passed all of the commercial rights to Formula One to him for 15 years, on the condition that they would return to the FIA at the end of that period. Ecclestone had been building up Formula One as a television package since the early 1990s, investing heavily in new digital television technology. For the duration of the deal, the FIA would receive an index-linked annual fixed royalty, estimated by Lovell at around 15%. Mosley said [...] "My belief is that I got a better deal than anyone else could have because it was more difficult for Ecclestone to take a hard line with me as we had worked together for so long." [...] The following year the FIA also passed the rights to all its other directly sanctioned championships and events to Ecclestone, also for 15 years, An attempt to add a 10-year extension to the F1 contract in return for a share in Ecclestone's proposed flotation of Formula One was later vetoed by the European Commission. Mosley's agreement with Ecclestone on TV rights for F1 angered three of the team principals in particular: Ron Dennis (McLaren), Frank Williams (Williams) and Ken Tyrrell (Tyrrell), who felt that neither Ecclestone nor the FIA had the right to make such an agreement without the teams. They refused to sign the 1997 Concorde Agreement without increased financial returns and threatened to make a complaint under European Union competition rules. The European Commission was already investigating the FIA’s agreement with Ecclestone in what Lovell calls a [...] "highly personal and bitter battle between Max Mosley and commissioner Karel van Miert".|$|R
