There are several reasons for this. Not only <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to find records from which to construct the subjective side of working-class lives, (this is presumably the case everywhere), but theserecords, even when they do exist, speak in the numerous languages of our ethnically fragmented population. The precondition to access to some of them requires a kind of double identity, an ability to be on intimate terms with some [...] "other" [...] Canadian experience, {{and at the same time}} the capability of communicating that experience to the mainstream culture. An additional problem, of course, is the highly selective nature of any such records. For obviously it is not some homogeneous working class, but certain self-conscious and articulate minorities who are likely to leave a record of any kind.|$|E

If research capability is based on idiosyncratic search routines or tacit knowledge, not only <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to transfer capability across firm boundaries but also the identification and nurturing of capabilities within firms are problematic. Earlier research suggests that research organizations need processes both for exploitation of existing as well as exploration of emerging research capabilities. This theoretical dichotomy is elaborated by examining technology-based corporate venturing practices in industrial research environments. The results are presented in an evolutionary model in which boundary operations, including corporate research, are central to the renewal of the organization...|$|E

We used {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) to study interference between simple auditory and visual decisions, independently of motor competition. Overlapping activity for auditory and visual tasks performed in isolation was found in lateral prefrontal regions, middle temporal cortex and parietal cortex. When the visual stimulus occurred during the processing of the tone, its activation in prefrontal and middle temporal cortex was suppressed. Additionally, reduced activity was seen in modality-specific visual cortex. These results paralleled impaired awareness of the visual event. Even without competing motor responses, a simple auditory decision interferes with visual processing on different neural levels, including prefrontal cortex, middle temporal cortex and visual regions...|$|E

Not only <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to detect new inconsistencies while the model changes but it also hard to keep track of known inconsistencies. The UML/Analyzer tool identifies inconsistencies instantly with design changes and it keeps track of all inconsistencies over time. It does not require consistency rules with special annotations. Instead, it treats consistency rules as black-box entities and observes their behavior during their evaluation to identify what model elements they access. The UML/Analyzer tool is integrated with the UML modeling tool IBM Rational Rose ™ for broad applicability and usability. It is highly scalable and was evaluated on dozens of design models...|$|E

40|$|Like {{national}} politicians, local {{representatives are}} claimed to become increasingly professionalised.

This article seeks to contribute to the debate by outlining the extent of, and relation between, layman politics and professionalisation in the recruitment and career of Belgian local councillors. After scrutinising these elements separately in a descriptive section, both are linked in a subsequent explanatory analysis, verifying whether professionalised recruitment in a given political system results in professionalised careers.
