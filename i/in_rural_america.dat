500|$|Alexander Hamilton (January 11, 1755 or 1757July 12, 1804) was an American statesman {{and one of}} the Founding Fathers of the United States. He was an {{influential}} interpreter and promoter of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the founder of the nation's financial system, the Federalist Party, the United States Coast Guard, and The New York Post newspaper. As the first Secretary of the Treasury, Hamilton was the main author of the economic policies of the George Washington administration. He took the lead in the funding of the states' debts by the Federal government, as well as the establishment of a national bank, a system of tariffs, and friendly trade relations with Britain. [...] His vision included a strong central government led by a vigorous executive branch, a strong commercial economy, with a national bank and support for manufacturing, plus a strong military. [...] This was challenged by Virginia agrarians Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, who formed a rival party, the Democratic-Republican Party. They favored strong states based <b>in</b> <b>rural</b> <b>America</b> and protected by state militias as opposed to a strong national army and navy. They denounced Hamilton as too friendly toward Britain and toward monarchy in general, and too oriented toward cities, business and banking.|$|E

40|$|<b>Rural</b> <b>America</b> will {{remember}} 2005 {{as a year}} of drought, hurricanes, and surging gas prices. To be sure, some {{regions of the country}} faced devastating natural catastrophes. Yet, these catastrophes did not stop the farm sector from posting another banner income year—nor did they stop the nonfarm sectors from enjoying solid gains in employment and income. Overall, the rural economy was quite resilient in 2005. Heading into 2006, the rural economy appears poised for another year of robust activity, especially if private sector forecasts hold true. Energy prices are the risk to the forecast. The higher oil and natural gas prices translate into higher production costs for factories, farms, and households.
