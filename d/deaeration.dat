5000|$|... ==Deaeration of feed water== Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide {{are removed}} from the feed water by <b>deaeration.</b> <b>Deaeration</b> can be {{accomplished}} by using deaerators heaters, vacuum deaerators, mechanical pumps, and steam-jet ejectors. In deaerating heaters steam sprays incoming feed water and carries away the dissolved gases. The deaerators also store hot feed water which is ready {{to be used in the}} boiler. This means of mechanical <b>deaeration</b> is also used with chemical oxygen scavenging agents to increase efficiency. (Sendelbach, p. 129) Deaerating heaters can be classified in to two groups. The two deaerating heaters are spray types and tray types. With tray type deaerating heaters the incoming water is sprayed into steam atmosphere in order to reach saturation temperature. When the saturation temperature is reached most of the oxygen and non-condensable gases are released. There are seals that prevent the recontamination of the water in the spray section. The water then falls to the storage tank below. The non-condensables and oxygen are then vented to the atmosphere. The components of the tray type deaerating heater are a shell, spray nozzles, direct contact vent condenser, tray stacks, and protective interchamber walls. The spray type deaerater is very similar to the tray type deaerater. The water is sprayed into a steam atmosphere and most of the oxygen and non-condensables are released to the steam. The water then falls to the steam scrubber where the slight pressure loss causes the water to flash a little bit which also helps with the removal of oxygen and non-condensables. The water then overflows to the storage tank. The gases are then vented to the atmosphere. With vacuum <b>deaeration</b> a vacuum is applied to the system and water is then brought to its saturation temperature. The water is sprayed in to the tank just like the spray and tray deaeraters. The oxygen and non-condensables are vented to the atmosphere.(Sendelbach, p. 130) ...|$|E

Also again, the vent line usually includes a valve and just enough steam is allowed to escape with the vented gases to provide a small and visible telltale plume of steam.|$|E
50|$|In the Boiler {{deaerator}} Working Principle Water {{is heated}} close to saturation temperature {{with a minimum}} pressure drop and minimum vent.

50|$|Biogenic Mn oxides (BMOs) are {{naturally}} occurring Mn oxides {{that have the}} ability to oxidize various redox-sensitive elements. A. strictum is a Mn(II)-oxidizing fungus that forms BMOs through the action of Mn(II) oxidase. In the presence of BMOs in buffer solutions with no additional nutrients, A. strictum is capable of sequestering high Mn(II) concentrations for at least 8 days, in which the amount of dissolved Mn(II) decreases rapidly in several hours and is converted to oxidized Mn(II). <b>Deaeration</b> of the buffer solution with N2 gas purging suppressed Mn(II) conversion, but this suppression is easily rescued by aeration, implying that dissolved oxygen is required for the Mn(II) sequestration and oxidation process. Adding NaN3, a toxic substance, also significantly reduces the sequestration rates of the fungal BMOs. Heat treatments revealed that temperatures below 85 °C do not alter the conformation of the Mn(II) oxidase in the BMOs. Freezing the fungal BMOs at -80 °C for 4 weeks did not affect the Mn(II) ability, and the reducible Mn was still dominated in solution. This makes fungal BMOs an effective Mn(II) sequestering material if needed. For example, it can be used for the continuous removal of Mn(II) from Mn(II) contaminated water without the need for any additives other than dissolved oxygen. The product is an oxide phase Mn(II) that would provide additional affinity for other toxic elements and thus prove as an effective method of water cleansing. Enzymatically active fungal BMOs can be harvested under specific cultivation conditions and remain active even under circumstances that would be unfavourable for fungal growth.|$|E

MethodsTwenty-three nonsmoking subjects with asthma or allergic rhinitis or without respiratory disease performed two sequential exhaled breath condensate (EBC) collections, using the RTube collection system and the EcoScreen condenser. EBC pH was measured immediately after collection and after storage at − 80 °C for 8 weeks, without <b>deaeration</b> and repeated following <b>deaeration</b> with Argon. ResultsIn EBC samples without <b>deaeration,</b> the EcoScreen pH values were significantly higher than the RTube pH values (mean difference, 0. 32; 95 % CI, 0. 21 – 0. 44, P< 0. 0001).

40|$|The Arizona Department of Transportation is {{developing}} the Phoenix-Cas a Grande Highway Stormwater Interceptor Project to handle storm {{water in the}} Phoenix area. Rectangular conduits near the ground surface collect the storm water and convey it to a vertical part of the structure which has several components. At the lower elevation is a large excavated chamber called the sump. Extending from the sump to the ground surface is a circular surge shaft containing two vertical walls. A diaphragm wall {{near the center of}} the surge shaft forms a dropshaft at the upstream end. The free trajectory inlet and diaphragm wall deflect the incoming water 90 degrees into the vertical dropshaft entraining considerable air. The water-air mixture falls down the dropshaft impinging on the sump invert. The entrained air has the effect of reducing impact pressures on the invert of the sump. A second wall at the downstream end of the surge shaft provides an air vent for returning air to the ground surface. The purpose of the surge shaft is to reduce pressure surges in the system. Downstream of the sump-surge shaft is the <b>deaeration</b> chamber. The sump and <b>deaeration</b> chamber provide for energy dissipation and air removal. Some air rises to the water surface in the surge shaft and escapes; the remaining air is carried into the <b>deaeration</b> chamber where it is removed. The <b>deaeration</b> chamber contains a false crown provided with air slots. The air rises to the false crown and escapes through the air slots to a horizontal chamber above; this chamber conveys the air to the vertical air shaft at the downstream end of the surge shaft. It is desirable to remove most of the entrained air from the water before it enters the tunnels. The entrapped air in the tunnels reduces the capacity for storage and conveyance and introduces the danger of high waterhammer effects upon its sudden release, which could cause damage to the system. The release of high velocity air at ground surface structures could also be hazardous. The effectiveness of the sump and <b>deaeration</b> chamber in dissipating energy and removing the entrained air was one factor considered in the evaluation of the various types tested. At the downstream end of the <b>deaeration</b> chamber a cylindrical surface was provided as an efficient entrance to the transition. In the transition the cross section gradually changed from a square section to the round section of the exit tunnel. Design information was needed for the three drop structures in the project. The decision was made to construct one model which would provide the necessary information. The model was constructed to a scale of 1 : 21. 91 and modelled drop structure No. 3 (Moreland Street) which has a design discharge of 2634 cfs.

40|$|Abstract Gas {{removal from}} the {{papermaking}} process {{is currently a}} standard practice, whereas purification of the internal water circulation has become common only recently. Both unit processes have progressed greatly during recent decades and new concepts are constantly being developed. The aim of this thesis was to analyse the efficiency and applicability of a channel flow design introduced by Metso for passive white water <b>deaeration</b> and to study the dynamics of passive bubbly gas removal. In addition, separation of the detrimental process water components by selective flotation during <b>deaeration</b> was studied to add further functionality to the channel flow design. Turbulent mixing at the flow discharge and the consequent air entrainment were seen to limit the gas separation efficiency. Also, the properties of different white waters notably affect their <b>deaeration</b> through viscous forces, the concentration of surface active components and bubble-particle interactions. Thus similar levels of gas separation cannot be achieved with all process waters. The analysis showed that the drag of small microbubbles is mostly caused by hydrophobic contamination and the dispersed particles that readily attach to the bubbles. Correlations were derived based on experimental data to provide new information on the drag force experienced by small bubbles in white waters. Chemically unaided flotation of white water in the channel flow was shown to be efficient in separating hydrophobic contaminants that have adverse effects on paper machine production and product quality. Both good reductions in contaminant content and high selectivity in their removal were achieved. Channel flow with an overflow can be considered well suited for {{the first stage of}} froth separation, while further treatment of the channel flow reject may consist of a secondary flotation or other process that enables the recirculation of fines and fillers. Although a certain level of losses of fines and fillers must be expected, substantial fraction of these solid components can be returned to the process stream. The proposed multifunctional process, channel flow <b>deaeration</b> and frothing of white water, was seen to be straightforward, economical and feasible while also providing benefits in terms of total process efficiency that are not delivered by any current process scheme.

40|$|This thesis {{outlines}} {{the use of}} powder properties, determined from bench tests to predict powder flow behaviour in pneumatic conveying particularly in dense phase and super dense phase systems. The bench test powder properties examined included, particle size and distribution, bulk density and particle density, surface characteristics, fluidization and <b>deaeration</b> characteristics, powder cohesiveness, tensile strength and wall friction characteristics. The surface characteristics of various powders pneumatically conveyed were observed by an Electron Scanning Microscope. This information provides a good insight into flow characteristics. Differences in shape and surface explain vastly different conveying characteristics of supposedly similar powders. Particle size and distribution of various powders were measured by a Malvern Particle Sizer. It was found that particle size determines, to a large extent, powder cohesiveness, fluidization and <b>deaeration</b> characteristics. Furthermore, the effect of particle density, bulk density, permeability and compressibility on flow behaviour were examined. These properties were determined using a Beckman Pycnometer, a Jenike Compressibility Tester and a Jenike Permeability Tester. The observed fluidization characteristics not only revealed the powder classification with respect to Geldart 2 ̆ 7 s diagram, but also revealed the extent of powder cohesiveness and ease of segregation. An estimate of a powder 2 ̆ 7 s cohesion was conveniently evaluated by use of an Arch Tester. This tester consists of a perspex silo with a variable width slotted outlet opened by a chain drive mechanism. The powder remains undisturbed as the outlet is opened. Each powder bed examined was subject to a set <b>deaeration</b> time before opening the outlet. These results were compared with the cohesion measured in a direct shear tester. It was found that arch length and <b>deaeration</b> characteristics assists prediction of powder behaviour and cohesion. Tensile strengths were measured using an Ajax W. S. L. Tensile Tester under different extents of consolidation. This property was found to indicate cohesiveness and indirectly the air retention capacity of powders. The <b>deaeration</b> characteristics of powders were observed in a perspex cylinder suitably instrumented. In particular, pressure transducers were connected at the middle {{and bottom of the}} cylinder fitted with permeable and impermeable bases, respectively. For effective measurement of <b>deaeration</b> characteristics, {{it was found that the}} fill rate should be as fast as possible. These characteristics are important for assessing air retention characteristics of powders. Knowledge of the powder velocity is very important parameter in pneumatic conveying. For instance, if powders travel too slow, they drop out from the suspension and settle at the bottom of the pipe. This may lead to a blockage. Hence, it is necessary to convey powders above the critical settling velocity and they should not be conveyed with excessive velocity, which leads to powder degradation, pipeline wear and increased energy consumption. To effect velocity measurement, an optical fibre probe was developed on the cross-correlation principle using two sensing probes, a fixed distance apart. The probe consisted of eight fibres in total. Six projector fibres are connected to a light source, which emits light to the powder passing through a sight glass fitted in the conveying line. In this case, the conveying line formed part of an actual pilot scale pneumatic conveying rig. Reflected light from the travelling powder was transmitted by two receiver fibres and cross-correlated, using a HP 3721 A correlator, to determine the particle transit time between the two fibres and thus predict the powder velocity. Wall friction is another important factor contributing to the pressure drop in dense phase pneumatic conveying. The frictional properties of powders have an adverse effect in pneumatic conveying. These properties were evaluated under aerated conditions in a perspex tube by pushing powders upwards for different column lengths. Due to the importance of cohesion in governing a powder 2 ̆ 7 s dense phase flow characteristics or whether it can be transported by pneumatic conveying, the cohesion strengths predicted by the Arch Tester, Jenike Shear Tester and the Tensile Tester. Hence, cohesiveness ranking of the various powders tested was possible. A new phase diagram incorporating powder properties is proposed to predict a powder 2 ̆ 7 s an optimal pneumatic conveying mode. This thesis concludes by correlating the described bench measured powder properties with reported actual powder pneumatic conveying characteristics. The identified correlations provide useful information for future pneumatic conveying system designs...|$|E

The effluent flow rate was shown to be proportional to the pressure with which the solvent was forced through the permeator. Water with lower dissolved oxygen levels proved to lessen the rate of degradation of pyrogallol. With both single and double pass systems, the protection afforded was significant. The investigation also suggests that pyrogallol will degradate by non-oxidative means if oxidative degradation processes are not viable...|$|E
40|$|Designing bulk {{material}} handling equipment requires {{a thorough understanding of}} the mechanical behaviour of powders and grains. Experimental characterization of granular materials is introduced focusing on flowability. A new prototype is presented which performs granular column collapse tests. The device consists of a channel whose design accounts for test inspection using visualization techniques and load measurements. A reservoir is attached where packing state of the granular material can be adjusted before run-off to simulate actual handling conditions by fluidisation and <b>deaeration</b> of the pile. Bulk materials on the market, {{with a wide range of}} particle sizes, can be tested with the prototype and the results used for classification in terms of flowability to improve industrial equipment selection processes...|$|E
