The ground {{movement}} laws due to <b>wide</b> <b>strip</b> mining under deep-lying seams {{has been}} studied with the experiment of similar material model, {{and the results of}} experiment could analysis qualitatively that it is feasible for <b>wide</b> <b>strip</b> mining under deep-lying seams. Taking 25 mining area of Hemei 9 th mine as geologic background, the model of <b>wide</b> <b>strip</b> mining under deep seams has been made, which was used to study on the deformation of overburden and the ground movement laws. The results of experiment show that the properties and thickness of strata play a control role on the deformation, and the key strata play a core role; the deformation was dispersed with <b>wide</b> <b>strip</b> mining. When the width of strip mining and protective coal pillar are scientific and reasonable, the purpose of increasing the width of strip mining under the condition of controlling deformation could be achieved, and the entire mining area would be formed a flat subsidence basin. These achievements provide a scientific basis for solving the problem for the ground buildings protection in the conditions of <b>wide</b> <b>strip</b> mining under deep-lying seams, and that also provide some references for further studying on the method of <b>wide</b> <b>strip</b> mining under deep-lying seams...|$|R

40|$|The {{two-dimensional}} {{problem of}} wave diffraction by {{a strip of}} arbitrary width is investigated here {{in the context of}} linearized theory of water waves by reducing it to a pair of Carleman-type singular integral equations. These integral equations have been solved earlier by an iterative process which is valid only for a suffciently <b>wide</b> <b>strip.</b> A new method is described here by which solutions of these integral equations are determined by solving a set of four Fredholm integral equations of the second kind, and the process is valid for a strip of arbitrary width. Numerical solutions of these Fredholm integral equations are utilized to obtain fairly accurate numerical estimates for the reﬂection and transmission coeffcients. Previous numerical results for a <b>wide</b> <b>strip</b> are recovered from the present analysis. Additional results for the reﬂection coeffcient are presented graphically for moderate values of the strip width which exhibit a less oscillatory nature of the curve than the case of a <b>wide</b> <b>strip...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractEvaluation of the lateral-torsional {{buckling}} resistance of bisymmetrical I-section beams using {{finite element method}} was widely discussed in the paper. Numerous FEM simulations {{with regard to the}} stability behavior of steel structural elements subjected to bending about the major principal axis were performed. The use of different finite element modeling techniques and their influence on obtained results were presented by the authors. The ultimate state of both perfect and imperfect elements was assessed. Considerations were concerned with <b>hot-rolled</b> <b>wide</b> flange HEB and narrow flange IPE section beams. Idealization of boundary conditions of FEM models complies with the assumptions used in the analytical formulation of stability problems of thin-walled beams.

40|$|We have {{measured}} Faraday Rotation Measures (RM) at Arecibo Observatory for 36 pulsars, 17 of them new. We {{combine these}} and earlier measurements {{to study the}} galactic magnetic field and its possible temporal variations. Many RM values have changed significantly on several–year timescales, but these variations probably do not reflect interstellar magnetic field changes. By studying the distribution of pulsar RMs near the plane {{in conjunction with the}} new NE 2001 electron density model, we note the following structures in the first galactic longitude quadrant: (1) The local field reversal can be traced as a null in RM in a 0. 5 –kpc <b>wide</b> <b>strip</b> interior to the Solar Circle, extending ∼ 7 kpc around the Galaxy. (2) Steadily increasing RMs in a 1 –kpc <b>wide</b> <b>strip</b> interior to the local field reversal, and also in the wedge bounded by 42 < l < 52 ◦, indicate that the large–scale field is approximately steady from the local reversal in to the Sagittarius arm.

40|$|The oxygen {{regime of}} urban tree-growing sites may be sub-optimal for tree {{growth and the}} related {{ornamental}} value of trees. Problems may especially occur in situations where the substrate is covered by pavement and/or where the water table is very shallow. The stability (oxygen consumption rate) of the organic components of the substrate (peat, green waste compost, etc.) and {{the design of the}} growing site also play an important role. The oxygen regime of a number of designs (<b>wide</b> <b>strip</b> of substrate; narrow strip; <b>wide</b> <b>strip</b> with multiple aeration pipes; narrow strip with one aeration pipe) was simulated for a range of substrates with the computer program ¿Matlab, pde toolbox¿. The program computed equilibrium distributions of oxygen in the substrates from gas diffusion coefficients of the different parts of the growing site constructions and from the specific oxygen consumption rate of the substrate. The simulation results were compared with measurements on an experimental substrate strip. The simulation results clearly showed the importance of organic matter stability and growing site design.
