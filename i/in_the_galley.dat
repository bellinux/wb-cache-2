Residents shared small kitchen and bathroom facilities.|$|E
5|$|After {{his return}} to Geneva, Knox was chosen to be the {{minister}} at a new place of worship petitioned from Calvin. In the meantime, Elizabeth Bowes wrote to Knox, asking {{him to return to}} Margery in Scotland, which he did at the end of August. Despite initial doubts {{about the state of the}} Reformation in Scotland, Knox found the country significantly changed since he was carried off <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>galley</b> in 1547. When he toured various parts of Scotland preaching the reformed doctrines and liturgy, he was welcomed by many of the nobility including two future regents of Scotland, the Earl of Moray and the Earl of Mar.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the battle}} {{something}} went wrong. While engaging the French galleys the Mary Rose suddenly heeled (leaned) heavily over to her starboard (right) side and water rushed in through the open gunports. The crew was powerless to correct the sudden imbalance, and could only scramble {{for the safety of}} the upper deck as the ship began to sink rapidly. As she leaned over, equipment, ammunition, supplies and storage containers shifted and came loose, adding to the general chaos. The massive port side brick oven <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>galley</b> collapsed completely and the huge 360-litre (90 gallon) copper cauldron was thrown onto the orlop deck above. Heavy guns came free and slammed into the opposite side, impeding escape or crushing men beneath them.|$|E

2500|$|In 1871, when John was 16, he and {{his older}} brother, Thomas Albert Bonser, left home and began working on riverboats on the Cowlitz, Lewis and Columbia rivers, doing {{everything}} from piloting the crafts to cooking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>galleys.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Attacker class {{comprised}} eight ships {{built in}} the United States for the Royal Navy during the Second World War. They were all built between 1941 and 1942 by Ingalls Shipbuilding or Western Pipe & Steel shipyards; both companies completed four ships. They were then supplied {{under the terms of}} Lend-Lease to the Royal Navy for their use. The ships had a complement of 646 men. Crew accommodations were significantly different from the normal for the Royal Navy at the time. Instead of food being prepared by separate messes, it was cooked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>galley</b> and served cafeteria-style in a central dining area. Unlike British-built ships, they were equipped with a modern laundry and a barber shop. The traditional hammocks were replaced by three-tier bunk beds, 18 to a cabin, which were hinged and could be tied up to provide extra space when not in use.|$|E
25|$|Born {{the second}} son of Sir Christopher Aylmer and Margaret Aylmer (née Plunkett), Aylmer served {{briefly in the}} Army and then joined the Royal Navy as a {{midshipman}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>galley</b> HMS Charles in October 1677 before being promoted to lieutenant in April 1678. Promoted to commander on 19 January 1679, he became commanding officer of the sloop HMS Chatham and then transferred to the command of the prize ship HMS Date Tree in Summer 1679. He transferred again to the command of the fire ship HMS Castle in the Mediterranean Fleet later in the year, to the command of the fifth-rate HMS Swann on the Coast of Ireland in July 1680 and to the command of the fourth-rate HMS Tiger in the Mediterranean Fleet in January 1682, before becoming commanding officer of the galley HMS Charles in September 1685. Aylmer was a young officer of the “courtier type” who benefited from the patronage of the Duke of Buckingham.|$|E
25|$|The SS Elbe {{incident}} {{resulted in}} a court case {{which took place in}} Rotterdam in November 1895. The court found that the steamship Crathie was alone at fault for the collision. Amazingly the captain was merely censured for leaving the disaster, a verdict that astounded the maritime world at the time. The blame was put squarely on the first mate, who had left his post at the bridge at the critical time to chat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>galley</b> with other crew members, and therefore had failed in his job of operating the ship's warning lights. The captain, officers and sailors of the SS Elbe received no rebuke from the court either, which caused some concern amongst the German public. The crew of the fishing smack Wildflower each were given, by Kaiser Wilhelm II, a silver and gold watch bearing his monogram and £5 as a gesture of thanks for saving the lives of the eighteen German citizens, an Austrian, and the English pilot. They also received other medals and gifts in the following years.|$|E

50|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> {{prison of}} Bicêtre, Vidocq was to wait several {{months for the}} {{transfer}} to <b>the</b> Bagne <b>in</b> Brest to toil <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>galleys.</b> A fellow inmate taught him the martial art of savate, which was later to prove useful to him. An escape attempt on 3 October 1797 failed and precipitated his placement in a dungeon for eight days.|$|R
2500|$|Sentencing criminals, {{political}} dissenters {{and religious}} deviants as galley rowers also turned <b>the</b> <b>galley</b> corps into a large, feared, and cost-effective prison system. French Protestants were particularly ill-treated at the oar {{and though they}} were only a small minority, their experiences came to dominate the legacy of <b>the</b> king's <b>galleys.</b> <b>In</b> 1909, French author Albert Savine (1859–1927) wrote that [...] "fter <b>the</b> Bastille, <b>the</b> <b>galleys</b> were <b>the</b> greatest horror of the old regime". Long after convicts stopped serving <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>galleys,</b> and even after the reign of Napoleon, the term galérien ("galley rower") remained a symbolic general term for forced labor and convicts serving harsh sentences.|$|R
500|$|Doppler {{commissions}} a ship {{called the}} RLS Legacy, {{on a mission}} to find Treasure Planet. The ship is commanded by the cat-like Captain Amelia along with her stone-skinned and disciplined first mate, Mr. Arrow. The crew is a motley bunch, secretly led by the half-robot cook John Silver, whom Jim suspects is the cyborg he was warned about. Jim is sent down to work <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>galley,</b> where he is supervised by Silver and his shape-shifting pet, Morph. Despite Jim's mistrust of Silver, they soon form a tenuous father-son relationship. Flashbacks are shown in Jim's youth when his father abandoned him.|$|E
500|$|In {{the decades}} that followed, {{fact and fiction}} became intertwined. As early as June 1883, the Los Angeles Times retold the Mary Celeste story with invented detail: [...] "Every sail was set, the tiller was lashed fast, not a rope was out of place... The fire was burning <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>galley.</b> The dinner was {{standing}} untasted and scarcely cold... the log [...] written up to the hour of her discovery." [...] Twenty years later, in the November 1906 Overland Monthly and Out West Magazine, Mary Celeste was recorded as drifting off the Cape Verde Islands, some [...] south of the actual location. Among many inaccuracies, the first mate was [...] "a man named Briggs," [...] and there were live chickens on board.|$|E
2500|$|On April 29, 1930, Vanderbilt's yacht, the Winchester, was set ablaze {{following}} an explosion. [...] No one was injured as the crew were all eating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>galley,</b> up front, but her owner's suite and guest suite's sustained $500,000 of damage.|$|E
50|$|Giorgio Miceli was {{a son of}} well-off parents, {{who participated}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Italian {{revolution}} of 1847. His father was sentenced to row <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>galleys</b> as punishment, and Giorgio was sent to Naples.

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> last watch before dawn, they {{attacked}} {{the guards and}} the sleeping Spaniards, killing most of them, although a few escaped by swimming or <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>galley's</b> tender. Upon hearing the commotion, Governor Dasmariñas, thinking that <b>the</b> <b>galley</b> was dragging and the men were taking to the oars, carelessly left his cabin bareheaded. He was killed by several Chinese waiting outside the door. Two Spaniards, Juan de Cuellar, the governor's secretary, and Franciscan Father Montilla, survived by remaining in their cabin amidships. They were later released ashore by the rebels.|$|R

2500|$|On 7 May, the fire-raising and looting continued, in {{the town}} and at Holyrood, and the English force was joined by Ralph Eure's 4000 border horsemen.

The {{fortress}} on the island of Inchgarvie was captured and destroyed by Richard Brooke <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Galley</b> Subtile on 6 May.

2500|$|On seeing flames {{around the}} cockpit, Thain {{feared that the}} {{aircraft}} would explode and told his crew to evacuate the area. The stewardesses, Rosemary Cheverton and Margaret Bellis, {{were the first to}} leave through a blown-out emergency window <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>galley,</b> followed by radio officer Bill Rodgers. Rayment was trapped in his seat by the crumpled fuselage and told Thain to go without him. Thain clambered out of the galley window. On reaching the ground, he saw flames growing under the starboard wing, which held [...] of fuel. He shouted to his crew to get away and climbed back into the aircraft to retrieve two handheld fire extinguishers, stopping to tell Rayment he would be back when the fires had been dealt with.|$|E
2500|$|A {{different}} issue {{had arisen}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>galley,</b> {{which had been}} built to provision the small crew of a French privateer and could not cater for the Royal Navy's larger complement of 160 men. The ship's cook, Bartholomew Barry, complained that the galley's two fireplaces were in constant operation {{but they had no}} external vents, leading to a [...] "smokiness which in truth is so great that no man living can stand it." [...] There were no stoves, and all cooking had to be done in kettles suspended from cables over the fires. Barry reported that these kettles regularly burned through their supports and fell onto the deck, scalding the crew. There is no record of Admiralty's responses to these concerns. In October Baillie received orders assigning Tartars Prize to the Navy's Mediterranean squadron, with which she was present at the Battle of Lagos in 1759.|$|E

50|$|Don Pedro of Toledo {{modified}} <b>the</b> tradition. <b>In</b> 1546, {{he ordered}} that the debtor instead had {{to approach the}} pillar and state his name, that of <b>the</b> lender <b>in</b> a clear and loud voice, {{and he had to}} stay for an hour bareheaded, embracing the column.

2500|$|Over the {{six days}} from 4 May 1982, five {{inspections}} {{were made to}} see if any equipment was worth salvaging. Orders were issued to shore up the hole in Sheffield's starboard side and tow the ship to South Georgia. Before these orders were effected, however, the burnt-out hulk had already been taken in tow by the [...] Yarmouth. The high seas that the ship was towed through caused slow flooding {{through the hole in the}} ship's side, which eventually sank her. The ship sank at [...] on 10 May 1982, the first Royal Navy vessel sunk in action since World War II. Twenty of her crew (mainly on duty <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>galley</b> area and in the computer room) died as a result of the attack. The wreck is a war grave and designated as a protected place under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986.|$|E
2500|$|In 1947, Raytheon {{built the}} [...] "Radarange", the first commercially {{available}} microwave oven. It was almost [...] tall, weighed [...] and cost about US$5,000 ($ in [...] dollars) each. It consumed 3 kilowatts, {{about three times}} as much as today's microwave ovens, and was water-cooled. The name was the winning entry in an employee contest. An early Radarange was installed (and remains) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>galley</b> of the nuclear-powered passenger/cargo ship NS Savannah. An early commercial model introduced in 1954 consumed 1.6 kilowatts and sold for US$2,000 to US$3,000 ($ to $ in [...] dollars). Raytheon licensed its technology to the Tappan Stove company of Mansfield, Ohio in 1952. They tried to market a large 220 volt wall unit as a home microwave oven in 1955 for a price of US$1,295 ($ in [...] dollars), but it did not sell well. In 1965, Raytheon acquired Amana. In 1967, they introduced the first popular home model, the countertop Radarange, at a price of US$495 ($ in [...] dollars).|$|E

2500|$|The {{connection}} with Gombert {{may not have}} been coincidental. [...] Gombert also spent time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>galleys,</b> only being pardoned, according to one story, after the publication of a set of Magnificats dedicated to Emperor Charles V. [...] It is possible that Pari not only knew Gombert's music but looked to his experience as inspiration to survive his own hard years of slavery; and the music akin to the dense contrapuntal style of Gombert was all composed after the end of Pari's sentence.|$|R
50|$|Difficulties <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{rule of the}} sea brought further changes. Until 1545 <b>the</b> oarsmen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>galleys</b> {{were free}} sailors {{enrolled}} on a wage. They were originally Venetians, but later Dalmatians, Cretans and Greeks joined in large numbers. Because of <b>the</b> difficulty <b>in</b> hiring sufficient crews, Venice had recourse to conscription, chaining the oarsmen to the benches as other navies had already done. Cristoforo da Canal was the first Venetian to command such a <b>galley.</b> By 1563, <b>the</b> population of Venice had dropped to about 168,000 people.|$|R
50|$|De Gourgue's {{early life}} is not well known. He came from the old and {{powerful}} family of Gourgue, {{one of the most}} important families of the French city of Bordeaux.

25|$|Aguilar was the {{principal}} accuser of Martín Cortes, Marquess del Valle, but upon recognizing Viceroy Peralta's sympathy with the marquess, Aguilar had withdrawn his accusations. He was arrested now and subjected to torture to determine which of his accounts was the true one. Under torture he admitted that the second version, favorable to Cortés, was meant to persuade the viceroy. He was condemned to ten years <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>galleys,</b> forfeiture of his property, and perpetual exile from the Indies. Also tried were the brothers Pedro and Baltazar de Quesada.|$|R
500|$|The {{base of the}} {{archipelago}} fleet was initially traditional <b>galleys,</b> but <b>the</b> war of 1741–43 and <b>the</b> war <b>in</b> Pomerania 1757–62 had revealed some inherent weaknesses: their firepower was inadequate, they were inefficient in terms of manpower, had poor protection for the crew and were not particularly seaworthy. During the Pomeranian War [...] "gun barges" [...] (skottpråmar), heavily armed, oar-driven, flat-bottomed broadside vessels with a shallow draft, had been tried {{to compensate for the}} lack of firepower <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>galleys,</b> but had proven far too slow to be effective.|$|R
2500|$|As {{has been}} {{recently}} established, {{he was born}} in Salines (Salins-les-Bains), Burgundy. [...] While little is known about his early life, he probably came to Italy or Sicily early in his life. [...] He was at the monastery of S.
