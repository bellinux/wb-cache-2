25|$|Since {{infrared}} (IR) {{remote controls}} use light, they require {{line of sight}} to operate the destination device. The signal can, however, be reflected by mirrors, {{just like any other}} light source. If operation is required where no line of sight is possible, for instance when controlling equipment in another room or installed in a cabinet, many brands of IR extenders are available for this on the market. Most of these have an <b>IR</b> <b>receiver,</b> picking up the IR signal and relaying it via radio waves to the remote part, which has an IR transmitter mimicking the original IR control. Infrared receivers also tend to have a more or less limited operating angle, which mainly depends on the optical characteristics of the phototransistor. However, it's easy to increase the operating angle using a matte transparent object in front of the receiver.|$|E

The angular intensity distribution of an emitter and the sensitivity distribution of a receiver allow for estimation of the angle and distance between them. Simple experiments have been conducted indicating that such a setup is able to give positional offset in any of 6 degrees of error (x, y, z, pitch, roll, and yaw) within a range. A theoretical framework is also established using least squares minimization.

30|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{low-cost}} infrared (IR) LED {{system with a}} novel arrangement that enables the self-localization of an indoor mobile robot. The proposed system uses only low-cost IR LED emitters installed on the ceiling of a building and low-cost <b>IR</b> <b>receivers,</b> each equipped with a photodiode, located {{on top of the}} mobile robot for detection. The IR LEDs, which are driven by an on-off keying modulator with various frequencies, are used as active landmarks. The mobile robot localizes itself based on the IR LED signals it receives. Although it would be desirable to assign a unique ID to each emitter, this would be difficult to realize because of the limited number of available frequencies and the production cost resulting from the use of independent microcontrollers. Therefore, we designed a novel landmark configuration consisting of an IR LED array with unique ID-encoding capabilities based on a combination of different frequencies and the repeated use of each ID encoding LED {{to address the problem of}} limited frequencies. The novel landmark arrangement reduces the costs associated with production, ID encoding, and computation. A Monte-Carlo localization method with a belief function is utilized to estimate the position and orientation of the mobile robot based on the decoded ID information and received signal strength. The proposed system was tested in a real environment and the experimental results confirmed the validity and accuracy of the system and method.|$|R
