5|$|Henry IV {{was plagued}} with {{financial}} problems, the political need to reward his supporters, frequent rebellions and declining healthincluding leprosy and epilepsy. The Percy {{family had been}} some of Henry's leading supporters, defending the North from Scotland largely at their own expense, but revolted {{in the face of}} lack of reward and suspicion from Henry. Henry Percy (Hotspur) was defeated and <b>killed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Shrewsbury. In 1405, Hotspur's father Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland, supported the Archbishop of York, Richard le Scrope, in another rebellion, after which the elder Percy fled to Scotland and his estates were confiscated.

This would probably have led to Henry's excommunication but the church {{was in the midst of}} the Western Schism, with competing popes keen on Henry's support; it protested but took no action. In 1408, Percy invaded England once more and was <b>killed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Bramham Moor. In Wales, Owain Glyndŵr's widespread rebellion was only suppressed with the recapture of Harlech Castle in 1409, although sporadic fighting continued until 1421.|$|E
