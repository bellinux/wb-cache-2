The goal {{of this study was}} to identify components to the reproductive biology of F. mexicanum that would better assist in managing the remaining plants and address the apparent lack of dispersal out of the current recorded range. To identify potential limiting traits in the reproductive life cycle (phenology) of the species, various stands of F. mexicanum were analyzed for pollination, seed dispersal, and germination characters in 2010 and 2011. The European honey bee (Apis mellifera) was the predominant floral visitor to F. mexicanum flowers comprising 88. 5...|$|E
