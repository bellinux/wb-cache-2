25|$|The Southern Rhodesian Land Apportionment Act {{reserved}} 49 {{million acres}} for white ownership and left 17.7 {{million acres of}} land unassigned to either the white preserve or the TTLs. While a survey undertaken by the colony's Land Commission {{in concert with the}} British government in 1925 found {{that the vast majority of}} black Rhodesians supported some form of geographic segregation, including the reservation of land exclusively for their use, many were disillusioned by the manner in which the legislation was implemented in explicit favour of whites. The overcrowded conditions in the TTLs compelled large numbers of Shona and Ndebele alike to abandon their rural livelihoods and seek wage employment in the cities or on white commercial farms. Those who remained on tracts in the TTLs found themselves having to cope with topsoil depletion due to overuse; large amounts of topsoil were stripped of their vegetation cover and rendered unproductive as a consequence. To control the rate of erosion, colonial authorities introduced voluntary <b>destocking</b> initiatives for livestock. When these met with little success, the <b>destocking</b> programme became mandatory in 1941, forcing all residents of the TTLs to sell or slaughter animals declared surplus. Another 7.2 million acres were also set aside for sale to black farmers, known as the Native Purchase Areas.|$|E
50|$|Active <b>destocking</b> {{should be}} {{distinguished}} from reactive <b>destocking.</b> Reactive <b>destocking</b> is a reduction of the inventory when expected demand goes down. When a company is only doing reactive <b>destocking</b> the inventory-to-sales ratio remains unchanged. Reactive <b>destocking</b> in general {{is done by the}} operational managers of the logistical activities, without additional instructions.|$|E

50|$|The shire is {{predominantly}} mining and pastoral land. There are 27 pastoral leases within the shire; 15 {{of which are}} owned by families or pastoral companies, ten of which are owned by mining companies, two are owned by the Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC). Both of the stations that are owned by the DEC are <b>destocked</b> and run as nature reserved, many of the leases owned by mining companies have also been <b>destocked.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Active <b>destocking</b> {{caused the}} Lehman wave and {{reactive}} <b>destocking</b> deepened it. The strong {{dip in the}} manufacturing industry seen {{at the end of}} 2008 was caused by cumulative and synchronized active <b>destocking</b> followed by reactive <b>destocking,</b> triggered by the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. Said bankruptcy created a sudden peak in the Libor interest rate, causing the banks to recall credit and companies to start freeing up cash by active <b>destocking,</b> so reducing their stocks. When the customers of a company start active <b>destocking</b> it is experienced by said company as lower demand and said company will respond by doing reactive <b>destocking.</b> End markets also responded by going down, but slower and in most markets not so strongly. The drop in end market plus the active and reactive <b>destocking</b> created a giant damped wave, the so-called Lehman wave.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "reactive destocking" [...] is {{relevant}} {{when it is}} used in connection with active <b>destocking.</b> Active <b>destocking</b> refers to an active decision to reduce the inventory to sales ratio of a company. In general, active <b>destocking</b> is done following an autonomous, often financial decision by a company to improve its efficiency, freeing up cash and reducing its costs. Decisions for active <b>destocking</b> in general are made by financial executives or general managers.|$|E

50|$|The {{area was}} struck by drought in 1926, {{although}} Marion Downs was faring well in 1926, this changed as the drought continued and by 1928 the property had been left {{in the hands of}} care-takers and had been mostly <b>destocked.</b>|$|R
50|$|A large grassfire {{occurred}} at the station in 1893 when a station hand accidentally started it when lighting a campfire. The fire cost Withnell and Meares a paddock 20 mi long that has been <b>destocked</b> for 6 months in preparation for lambing.|$|R

50|$|Reactive <b>destocking</b> in {{supply chain}} {{management}} is a reduction of the inventory when expected demand goes down. When a company is only doing reactive <b>destocking,</b> the desired inventory to sales ratio, remains unchanged. Reactive <b>destocking</b> in general is done by operational managers of the logistical activities, without additional instructions. The inventory can include finished products, raw materials and/or goods in process.|$|E

50|$|By 1896 the lessee was the Union Bank and the {{property}} was being managed by Henry Roche. The area was in its third year of drought in 1897 with very little feed on the ground. By 1902 {{the property}} was almost completely <b>destocked.</b>|$|R
50|$|Alex Chapple, an American, {{acquired}} the property prior to 1996. He employed Paul Edmonds as manager who {{convinced him to}} hold onto the station. The property was mostly under developed at this stage and had also been <b>destocked</b> to eradicate brucellosis and tuberculosis.|$|R
30|$|More generally, our {{findings}} suggest that pastoralists (as well as other land or livestock managers) can minimize negative interactions and maximize positive interactions through two means: first, by minimizing competition between wild herbivores and livestock during the dry season; and second, by maintaining or increasing habitat heterogeneity. Minimizing competition might be achieved through avoiding critical wildlife habitat during dry times. A more heterogeneous landscape may also afford more refugia for wildlife in times of drought. Realistically, however, {{it may be difficult to}} minimize competition and land degradation unless pastoralists <b>destock</b> during or in anticipation of dry periods and then later restock. Drought index insurance programs (Hazell and Hess 2010) and slaughter off-take programs (Zwaagstra et al. 2010) may provide incentives to <b>destock</b> where conventional, commercial market sales are not a feasible option.|$|R
50|$|The first {{described}} Lehman wave {{was caused by}} global active <b>destocking</b> and reactive <b>destocking</b> after the financial panic following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008. The Lehman wave can have strong effects on the sales volume and therefore on the profitability of companies higher in the value chain.|$|E
50|$|When {{the sales}} of {{automobiles}} suddenly dropped in Q4 2008, the suppliers to the automotive producers not only had to absorb the decline itself, but also the corresponding re-active <b>destocking</b> in the whole supply chain that followed the declining end market. This is because the Automotive industry started active <b>destocking.</b>|$|E

50|$|Yundamindera is {{currently}} owned by Minara Resources {{along with three}} other nearby properties: Glenorn, Nambi and Minara Stations. In 2012 Glenorn and Nambi were running approximately 1,700 head of cattle, but Yundamindera and Minara have both been <b>destocked.</b> By 2016 all four stations are now successfully running herds of cattle.|$|R
50|$|By 2007 the Prominent Hill {{mining lease}} {{commenced}} {{and parts of}} the station had to be <b>destocked.</b> By 2014 Mount Eba was on the market. At that time it was stocked with 11,000 merino sheep and 300 cattle. Mount Eba was the last property that had been owned by the Nitschkes to be sold.|$|R
50|$|Gindalbie Metals, an {{iron ore}} miner, {{proposed}} to turn {{part of its}} operations at Badja into a national radioactive waste management facility in 2015. Badja was <b>destocked</b> {{at the time and}} occupied an area of 1336 km2. The station {{was the subject of a}} native title claim by Indigenous Australians, the Widi peoples, at the time.|$|R

5000|$|Active and re-active <b>destocking</b> {{explains}} why some companies {{can see a}} strong dip in sales while their end markets are fairly stable. If the supply chain between a company and its end-customer would have a stock depth of [...] "250 days' sales", meaning that it takes at least 250 days for a molecule to travel from a companies' warehouse to the end consumer, and if each firm in such a 250-day supply chain decides to do active <b>destocking</b> of 12%, an amount of stock equal to 30 days' sales (a whole month) is {{taken out of the}} chain. For a company {{at the beginning of the}} supply chain this will result in either a business standstill for a whole month or a 33% decline during three months.This discovery of active <b>destocking,</b> reactive <b>destocking</b> and the Lehman Wave can have important implications for manufacturing scheduling, inventory management, work force management and budgeting.|$|E

50|$|In 1872, {{brothers}} Roderick and Donald MacKay, and Donald's son, Samuel Peter Mackay, {{took up a}} {{tract of}} country on the Yule River, {{where there was a}} good pool of permanent water, bearing the Aboriginal name Mundabullangana. Although for most of its history Mundabullanganna was predominantly a sheep station, in 1985 it was <b>destocked</b> in favour of cattle.|$|R
50|$|In 2014 {{the owner}} of the {{property}} was the Saint Barbara mining Company. The property was <b>destocked</b> in 2014 and was suffering from an infestation of coral cactus. The cactus had spread from a few plants that were discarded at the tip to a core area of 3 ha with isolated clumps spread over an area of 66 km2.|$|R
50|$|The area {{experienced}} a prolonged drought from 2000 to 2010, when stations such as Mount Clere {{had only one}} year of almost average rainfall. By 2010 the station had been largely <b>destocked</b> and was hand-feeding the remaining cattle on the property. The station owner, Greg Watters, said the land was so dry even the trees were dying, a situation {{he had not seen}} before.|$|R

50|$|The 4047 km2 station {{stocked with}} 20,000 head of Red Brahman cattle was {{acquired}} by Kerry Stokes from Peter Leutenegger in 2015 for an estimated 23 million to 40 million. Leutenegger, a former helicopter pilot, {{had worked in the}} region since 1980, and had acquired the property in 1992 after the Brucellosis and Tuberculosis Eradication program in the Kimberleys in the 1980s had led to many stations having to <b>destock.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2009 {{the lease}} {{was owned by}} Nickel West, a {{subsidiary}} of BHP Billiton, and was managed by Simon Kopke. Prior to 2008 Weebo was running 8,000 sheep but was completely <b>destocked</b> that year after experiencing problems with wild dogs. Kopke introduced a herd of 200 goats onto the property for the domestic meat market into one 80 km2 paddock. The goats were being protected by an electrified fence and four Maremma dogs.|$|R
50|$|Yeelirrie Station covers {{an area of}} 3750 km2. The {{station was}} {{originally}} established in 1924 by Val Finch. In 1950, 7179 sheep were shorn for 169 bales (approx. 25,000 kg). In 1957 the neighboring Altona pastoral lease was incorporated into the station. Yeelirrie is now {{owned and operated by}} BHP Billiton. From 1974 to 1986 the station was largely <b>destocked.</b> A small number of sheep were run. These were recently removed due to increasing incidence of wild dog and dingo attacks.|$|R
