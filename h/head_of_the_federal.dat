5|$|On 26 December 2013, {{a team of}} Russian {{scientists}} {{released a}} report saying they had found no trace of radioactive poisoning—a finding that comes after the French report found traces of the radioactive isotope polonium. Vladimir Uiba, the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Medical and Biological Agency, said that Arafat {{died of natural causes}} (without explaining which) and the agency had no plans to conduct further tests. Unlike the Swiss report, the French and Russian reports were not made public, at the time. The Swiss experts read the French and Russian reports and explained that the radiologic data measured by the other teams support their conclusions of a probable death by polonium poisoning. In March 2015 a French prosecutor announced that his death was of natural causes, and the polonium and lead traces found were environmental.|$|E

25|$|As {{the talks}} dragged on to mid-December without movement, the {{government}} began to take action. ESA administrator Roger Putnam summoned to Washington, D.C., Fairless, Ernest T.

The three met with Putnam on December 13, who attempted to determine what the employers' bargaining position was. Although Putnam ruled out price relief based on a rise in wages, {{for the first time}} he and OPS director DiSalle indicated that the government would permit the steel manufacturers to seek the maximum price increase allowed by the Capehart Amendment. Cyrus Ching, now <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Mediation and Conciliation Service, sent two of his top aides to meet with union officials to determine the union's bargaining strategy and timeline. The aides met with Murray and the union's collective bargaining committee on December 14, but made no headway. WSB director Feinsinger, however, began paving the way for a relaxation of Wage Regulation 6. On December 8, Feinsinger told the press that the Board was already working on a revision to the regulation which would permit merit pay increases. Five days later, Feinsinger let it be known that a number of economic issues (such as increased pension contributions) might be removed from the calculation of the basic wage rate in order to relieve the pressure on the negotiating parties.|$|E
25|$|A second {{labor dispute}} halted {{work on the}} bridge when 200 members of Sand and Gravel Workers Union Local 22075 went out on strike over a refusal by the Smoot Sand and Gravel Corporation to adopt the closed shop. The strike, which began on August 14, {{immediately}} halted concrete work {{not only on the}} new Sousa Bridge but on more than 20 building and transportation infrastructure projects, and idled more than 5,000 workers. Howard T. Colvin, a United States Department of Labor conciliator, was called in to help end the dispute. Initially, Colvin expressed optimism that the strike could be settled swiftly. But the union rejected a potential settlement on August 23 because it lacked specific wage and hour agreements. On August 25, Representative William Alvin Pittenger (R-Minnesota) asked the Army Corps of Engineers to break the strike and supply sand and gravel itself. The Army refused. On August 28, the federal government intervened in the strike. Federal Works Agency Administrator John M. Carmody questioned why the single source was used to supply all the sand and gravel to so much projects, and threatened to find a new supplier if a settlement was not forthcoming. John R. Steelman, <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Mediation and Conciliation Service, announced he was personally interveneing in the negotiations {{to bring an end to}} the strike. Meanwhile, Colvin proposed a strike settlement which was immediately accepted by the union and rejected by the company. Carmody and Steelman's intervention appeared to work. Progress in strike talks was announced on August 30, and on September 5 the company and union ended the strike after agreeing to Colvin's terms.|$|E
