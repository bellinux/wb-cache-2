5|$|Ultimately, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> {{unlikely}} that any media company, particularly the major studios and television network making Inferno and 12 Monkeys, would risk the negative publicity that would come from using the images in the spectrograms and a suggested threat against a U.S. president.|$|E
5|$|During {{the decade}} of the 530s, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> to many that God had {{abandoned}} the Christian Roman Empire. There were noxious fumes in the air; and the Sun, while still providing day, refused to give much heat. This caused famine unlike anything those of the time had seen before, weakening the people of Europe and the Middle East.|$|E

5|$|In 1874, Parker was {{the caucus}} nominee of the Republican Party for a Missouri Senate seat.

5|$|In 1902, Michael met Princess Beatrice of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. They fell in {{love and}} began to {{correspond}} in her native English. Michael spoke both French and English fluently. At first <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> they would marry; however, the Orthodox Church prohibited the marriage of first cousins, and Michael's father and Beatrice's mother were siblings. Nicholas refused to permit the marriage and, to Michael's and Beatrice's mutual dismay, their romance ended.|$|E

5|$|In early 1926, {{the general}} was again named Premier, and {{approached}} the PNR and its close ally, the Peasants' Party, proposing a merger around his leadership. This met with a stiff refusal, as <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> that the two were about to win the elections with additional support, but the king, suspicious of the left-wing credentials of the Peasants' Party, used his Royal Prerogative and nominated Averescu as premier (with PNL support).|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> to me {{sufficient}} to indicate, {{in the first}} edition of my 'Origin of Species,' that by this work 'light would be thrown on the origin of man and his history;' and this implies that man must be included with other organic beings in any general conclusion respecting his manner of appearance on this earth.|$|E

5000|$|<b>It</b> <b>seems</b> that Heisenberg in 1927 was {{thinking}} in terms of a classical diffractor. According to Bacciagaluppi & Crull (2009), Heisenberg in 1927 recognized that [...] "the electron is deflected only in the discrete directions that depend on the global properties of the grating." [...] Nevertheless, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> that this did not lead him to think that the collective global properties of the grating should make it a diffractor with corresponding quantal properties, such as would supply the diffracted electron with a definite trajectory. <b>It</b> <b>seems,</b> rather, that he thought of the diffraction as necessarily a manifestation of wave character belonging to the electron. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> that he felt this was necessary to explain interference when the electron was detected far from the diffractor. Thus <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> possible that in 1927, Heisenberg was not {{thinking in terms}} of Duane's hypothesis of quantal transfer of translative momentum. By 1930, however, Heisenberg thought enough of Duane's hypothesis to expound it in his textbook.|$|R

5|$|By {{the thirteenth}} and fourteenth centuries AD, Virgil had gained a {{reputation}} as a virtuous pagan, a term referring to pagans who were never evangelized and consequently during their lifetime had no opportunity to recognize Christ, but nevertheless led virtuous lives, so that <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> objectionable to consider them damned. Eventually, some Christians sought to reconcile Virgil's works with the supposed Christianity present in them. Consequently, during the Late Antiquity and beyond, many assumed that the puer referenced in the Fourth Eclogue was actually Jesus Christ.|$|E
5|$|In the {{interests}} of keeping the strip exciting, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> that no season for Melchester Rovers could ever consist of mid-table obscurity. Almost every year, the club was either competing for the major honours {{at the top of}} the domestic and European game, or struggling against relegation to lower divisions. Often, such spells of good and bad fortune and form would directly succeed one another—a Rovers team that won the European Cup one year could find itself struggling to stay in Division One the next.|$|E

6000|$|But why {{was this}} story of Joseph put into Holy Scripture, and at such length, too? <b>It</b> <b>seems,</b> at first sight, to be simply a family history--the story of {{brothers}} and their father; <b>it</b> <b>seems,</b> at first sight, to teach us nothing concerning our redemption and salvation; <b>it</b> <b>seems,</b> at first sight, not to reveal anything fresh to us concerning God; <b>it</b> <b>seems,</b> at first sight, not to be needed for the general plan of the Bible history. It tells us, of course, how the Israelites first came into Egypt; and that was necessary for us to know. But the Bible might {{have told us that}} in ten verses. Why has it spent upon the story of Joseph and his brethren, not ten verses, but ten chapters? ...|$|R

At first, <b>it</b> <b>seemed,</b> that Sycamore {{might not be the}} location of the DeKalb County Courthouse; other towns were vying for the county seat title. A now defunct town called Brush Point was the choice of a Dr. Henry Madden and Rufus Colton would have preferred Coltonville, where he made his home.|$|E
5|$|The Lady Chapel {{was built}} by William de Braose, bishop from 1266 to 1287. It was built {{at the rear of}} the church {{constructed}} by Urban and the old choir area was removed in order to build the chapel. From this time on, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> as if the cathedral was in a constant state of repair or alterations at a slow pace. After the Lady Chapel had been completed, the two bays of the north choir aisle were rebuilt.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle between}} Sydney and Kormoran {{is seen as}} controversial: the disbelief that a {{modified}} merchant ship could so successfully defeat a cruiser combined {{with the lack of}} Australian survivors led some to believe that the German account was false. Rumours that the battle was not what <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> had been around since Sydney failed to reach Fremantle on schedule in 1941, but several historians (including Tom Frame and Wesley Olson) credit Michael Montgomery and his 1980 book Who Sank The Sydney? with igniting the controversy.|$|E

5|$|The {{day after}} Cleave's article {{appeared}} in the Evening Standard, Beatles press officer Tony Barrow offered Datebook, a US teen magazine, rights to all four interviews. Barrow believed the pieces were important to show fans that the Beatles were progressing beyond simple pop music and producing more intellectually challenging work. As Datebook was a socially progressive magazine that addressed subjects such as interracial dating and legalization of marijuana, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> like a suitable vehicle to carry this information.|$|E
