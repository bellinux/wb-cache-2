5|$|Alms {{sent the}} {{captured}} Alliantie back to Britain {{under the command}} of Lieutenant Patrick Tonyn of Stag and gave despatches to the Admiralty to Lieutenant William Huggell of Reunion to deliver. He himself remained at sea with the squadron, completing their assigned patrol. British casualties included four killed and 13 wounded on Stag, one killed and three wounded on Reunion and two wounded on Isis. Only Vestal escaped without any damage or casualties. Batavian casualties in the engagement are not known due to the failure of Alms to record Allianties losses in his report to the Admiralty, an omission which James criticises him <b>for.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> known that Argo lost two men killed and 15 wounded in the chase. The surviving Batavian ships remained at anchor in the Eigerøya channel until the spring of 1796 when they successfully returned to the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|Curtis Benson {{wrote the}} film {{adaptation}} <b>for</b> <b>It</b> <b>Is</b> the Law; unlike the theatrical version, his screenplay presents the story entirely in chronological order. J. Gordon Edwards directed, {{the only time}} he did so in 1924, as he was primarily serving as Fox Film's director-general at the time. It was also his last time to direct; he retired from Fox after the film's completion, and although he expressed an interest to returning to the role, he died of pneumonia the following year. Filming took place at Fox's New York studio, although most production had by then moved to Hollywood. It Is the Law was one of only four films Fox made at its East Coast facility in 1924. Except for four Allan Dwan films in 1926, they were the last Fox produced in New York. The Film Daily reported that a trailer was produced to advertise the film.|$|E
5|$|Eliminativists such as Paul and Patricia Churchland {{argue that}} folk {{psychology}} is a fully developed but non-formalized theory of human behavior. It {{is used to}} explain and make predictions about human mental states and behavior. This view {{is often referred to}} as the theory of mind or just simply theory-theory, <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a theory which theorizes the existence of an unacknowledged theory. As a theory in the scientific sense, eliminativists maintain, folk psychology needs to be evaluated on the basis of its predictive power and explanatory success as a research program for the investigation of the mind/brain.|$|E

5|$|Helium must be {{extracted}} from natural gas {{because it is}} present in air at {{only a fraction of}} that of neon, yet the demand <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> far higher. It is estimated that if all neon production were retooled to save helium, that 0.1% of the world's helium demands would be satisfied. Similarly, only 1% of the world's helium demands could be satisfied by re-tooling all air distillation plants. Helium can be synthesized by bombardment of lithium or boron with high-velocity protons, or by bombardment of lithium with deuterons, but these processes are a completely uneconomical method of production.|$|E

5|$|Most of the equipment, arms, and {{machinery}} at the Little Rock Arsenal was removed to {{east of the}} Mississippi River by order of Maj. Gen.

By all appearances, the equipment was sent down the river to Napoleon, Arkansas, {{and from there to}} Jackson Mississippi, where it was probably destroyed during the Vicksburg campaign in the early summer of 1863.|$|E

5|$|The Central Lowlands is a {{rift valley}} mainly {{comprising}} Paleozoic formations.

This area has also experienced intense volcanism, Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh being the remnant of a once much larger volcano.

Chlorophyll, the E numbers E140 and E141, is the most common green chemical found in nature, and only allowed in certain medicines and cosmetic materials. Quinoline Yellow (E104) is a commonly used coloring in the United Kingdom but is banned in Australia, Japan, Norway and the United States. Green S (E142) is prohibited in many countries, <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> known to cause hyperactivity, asthma, urticaria, and insomnia.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Greeks of Thessalonica sent an embassy to the Great Council to {{complain}} of violations {{of their rights}} by the duke and captain. Among other things, they insisted that the Venetians fortify Kassandreia on the western Chalcidice, to protect the Kassandra Peninsula from Ottoman raids. In response, Michiel occupied the fort of Kassandreia, which he refortified and strengthened by the construction of two smaller forts in the area. He also captured the Platamon Castle, {{on the opposite side}} of the Thermaic Gulf, by storm, after setting fire to its main bailey as the Ottoman garrison refused to surrender. Platamon was repaired but probably abandoned soon after, <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not mentioned again. Following Michiel's request, the Great Council sent 200 men from Padua to man Thessalonica and the forts of Kassandreia, and authorised the captain-general to maintain four galleys in the area. From his letters to the Great Council, Michiel was also engaged in negotiations with the Ottomans, as part of which he offered 20,000 aspers a year to the Ottoman governor of Thessaly, Turahan Bey, and to the Grand Vizier. At the same time, according to the Codex Morosini, a pretender claiming to be Mustafa Çelebi arrived in Thessalonica, and gathered a growing following of Turks who considered him to be the true son of Sultan Bayezid. Pseudo-Mustafa launched raids against Murad's forces from the city, but after both Mustafa and the Venetian captain were almost captured during one of these raids, on 3 September the Great Council issued instructions to stop such raids, and keep the gates of the city shut.|$|E
