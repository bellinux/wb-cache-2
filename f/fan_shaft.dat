50|$|In {{the second}} major phase of mining in the Upper Harz from 1524, {{smelting}} was gradually moved into fixed sites. The transportation of logs as rafts {{and the use of}} water power led to the selection of advantageous sites on the rivers in the Harz - such as the Innerste, Grane and Oker. At one location that had already been used in medieval times (1180), the Frankenscharrn Hut emerged, which later became the Clausthal Lead Smelting Works (Bleihütte Clausthal), the most famous one in the Upper Harz. It was worked until 31 December 1967. Other important smelters were the silver works (Silberhütte) in Lautenthal (later merged with the Bleihütte Clausthal), the silver works in Altenau (to 1911) and the Andreasberg Silver Works (Silberhütte Andreasberg, to 1912). After the Upper Harz metal works were closed the ores of the remaining Grund Ore Mine were reduced in the Upper Harz works (to 1981) and finally in the Binsfeldhammer Lead Works near Aachen. The various metalworks, especially the Clausthal Works left behind considerable environmental damage. By contrast, the buildings and facilities in the Upper Harz have completely disappeared. From the first mining period until just before the industrial age the so-called precipitation method (Niederschlagsarbeit) was used in the Upper Harz. Instead of the usual roasting (desulphurising) of the ore, the slag was melted using charcoal with granulated iron (Eisengranalien) as a reduction medium using the roast-reaction process (Röst-Reaktions-Verfahren) (direct conversion from metal sulphide to metal) in arched kilns (Krummofen). The comparatively low kiln temperatures of around 1000 °C produced no liquid slag, the residue (gangue) remained in solid form. Not until the development of more powerful <b>fan</b> <b>shaft</b> kilns around 1850 were the concentrates roasted in double-deck ovens (Etagenöfen) and sintering pans and then melted in crucible shaft kilns (Tiegelschaftofen) on silver-containing argentiferous lead (Werkblei) and molten slag. The argentiferous lead was initially worked immediately in the German tests on lightened silver. At the start of the 20th century a multi-stage refining process was carried out in Kesselherden and silver extracted using the Parkes process.|$|E

However, development of a 50, 000 + hp gearbox required by fans in a large twin engine transport aircraft presents an extreme technical challenge, therefore another approach is needed. This paper presents a propulsion system which transmits power from the turbine to the fan electrically rather than mechanically. Recent and anticipated advances in high temperature superconducting generators, motors, and power lines offer the possibility that such devices can be used to transmit turbine power in aircraft without an excessive weight penalty. Moving to such a power transmission system does more than provide better matching between fan and turbine shaft speeds. The relative ease with which electrical power can be distributed throughout the aircraft opens up numerous other possibilities for new aircraft and propulsion configurations and modes of operation. This paper discusses a number of these new possibilities. The Boeing N 2 hybrid-wing-body (HWB) is used as a baseline aircraft for this study. The two pylon mounted conventional turbofans are replaced by two wing-tip mounted turboshaft engines, each driving a superconducting generator. Both generators feed a common electrical bus which distributes power to an array of superconducting motor-driven fans in a continuous nacelle centered along the trailing edge of the upper surface of the wing-body. A key finding was that traditional inlet performance methodology has to be modified when most of the air entering the inlet is boundary layer air. A very thorough and detailed propulsion/airframe integration (PAI) analysis is required at the very beginning of the design process since embedded engine inlet performance must be based on conditions at the inlet lip rather than freestream conditions. Examination of a range of fan pressure ratios yielded a minimum Thrust-specific-fuel-consumption (TSFC) at the aerodynamic design point of the vehicle (31, 000 ft /Mach 0. 8) between 1. 3 and 1. 35 FPR. We deduced that this was due to the higher pressure losses prior to the fan inlet as well as higher losses in the 2 -D inlets and nozzles. This FPR is likely to be higher than the FPR that yields a minimum TSFC in a pylon mounted engine. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{detailed}} study of the air flow through the fan stage of a high-bypass, geared turbofan in windmilling conditions is proposed, to address the key performance issues of this severe case of off-design operation. Experiments are conducted in the turbofan test rig of ISAE, specifically suited to reproduce windmilling operation in an ambient ground setup. The engine is equipped with conventional measurements and radial profiles of flow quantities are measured using directional five-hole probes to characterize the flow across the fan stage and derive windmilling performance parameters. These results bring experimental evidence {{of the findings of}} the literature that both the fan rotor and stator operate under severe off-design angle-of-attack, leading to flow separation and stagnation pressure loss. The fan rotor operates in a mixed fashion: spanwise, the inner sections of the rotor blades add work to the flow while the outer sections extract work and generate a pressure loss. The overall work is negative, revealing the resistive loads on the fan, caused by the bearing friction and work exchange in the different components of the <b>fan</b> <b>shaft.</b> The parametric study shows that the fan rotational speed is proportional to the mass flow rate, but the fan rotor inlet and outlet relative flow angles, as well as the fan load profile, remain constant, for different values of mass flow rate.

This thesis aims to develop a new design of the fans for the quenching ovens, and the goal is that the new fans will bring cost savings for Scana-Booforge. The design development process started with mapping out the environment in which the fans operate, and with analysis of the existing fan structure and damages, in order to establish the cause of failure and of short durability. The performance of the fan were also established at this stage. A specific cost index was developed to allow for comparison between the existing structure and the new design. The specific cost index is based on cost through lifespan. With knowledge of the existing fan performance it was then possible to set requirements for the new fan. Thereafter a number of concepts were generated. The concept that met the requirements best was then selected for further analysis, and optimization, in order to obtain an optimal design, regarding lifespan and capacity (that is the fans ability to circulate air).

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} {{active noise control}} systems [1, 2] have shown the effects that plant and {{disturbance}} uncertainties have on optimizing the locations of actuators and sensors. The effects of plant and disturbance uncertainties on multichannel feedforward control systems have also been investigated, {{and it has been}} shown that these uncertainties can lead to instability or sub-optimal performance [3]. Using a similar methodology here, the effect of various plant and disturbance uncertainties on the performance of an active noise control (ANC) system for a spray dryer exhaust is investigated. The objective of the ANC system described here is to reduce the noise radiated to surrounding communities from the exhaust outlet of spray dryer facilities used for making powered milk. The noise is dominated by a single tone at a frequency corresponding to the fan blade passing frequency. The exhaust duct is about 18 meters long and has a diameter of 1. 6 meters with the cut-on frequency of about 134 Hz at 65 Â°C. When the fan is running, the dominant blade pass frequency is around 180 Hz, so higher order cylindrical duct modes had to be considered. The active noise control system uses a feedforward structure to control tonal noise, where the reference signal is obtained by attaching a magnetic sensor on the <b>fan</b> <b>shaft.</b> The number and locations of the control sources and error sensors has been optimized to achieve global control [4], and the robustness of such an arrangement under different plant and disturbance uncertainties will not be considered here. Only the behaviour of the control algorithm under such uncertainties will be discussed. The primary noise was characterized by 8 microphones, which are located at more than 10 meters downstream of the fan. The variation of the amplitude and phase of the primary fan noise (disturbance) at its peak frequency were measured. The variation of the cancellation path transfer functions (plant) between 4 control sources (loudspeakers) and the 8 microphones under different situations are also measured. The goal of the controller design is for an adaptive algorithm, which uses the 4 control sources, to generate control signals to reduce the tonal component of the noise at the 8 error sensors, and the controller should be able to maintain stability under most situations.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. The Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR) {{is one of}} {{the most}} technologically {{advanced}} developments in South Africa. In order to build a commercially viable demonstration power plant, all the specifically and uniquely designed equipment must first be qualified. All the prototype equipment is tested at the Helium Test Facility (HTF) at Pelindaba. One of the largest components that are tested is the Core Unloading Device (CUD). The main function of the CUD is to unload fuel from the bottom of the reactor core to enable circulation of the fuel core. The CUD housing vessel forms part of the reactor pressure boundary. Pebble-directing valves and other moving machinery are installed inside its machined inner surface. It is essential that the interior surfaces of the CUD are case hardened to provide a corrosion- and wear-resistant layer. Cold welding between the moving metal parts and the machined surface must also be prevented. Nitriding is a case hardening process that adds a hardened wear- and corrosion-resistant layer that will also prevent cold welding of the moving parts in the helium atmosphere. Only a few nitriding furnaces exist that can house a forging as large as the CUD of the PBMR. Commercial nitriding furnaces in South Africa are all too small and have limited flexibility in terms of the nitriding process. The nitriding of a vessel as large as the CUD has not yet been carried out commercially. The aim of this work was to design and develop a custom-made nitriding plant to perform the nitriding of the first PBMR/HTF CUD. Proper process control is essential to ensure that the required nitrided case has been obtained. A new concept for a gas nitriding plant was developed using the nitrided vessel interior as the nitriding process chamber. Before the commencement of detail design, a laboratory test was performed on a scale model vessel to confirm concept feasibility. The design of the plant included the mechanical design of various components essential to the nitriding process. A special stirring fan with an extended length shaft was designed, taking whirling speed into account. Considerable research was performed on the high temperature use of the various components to ensure the safe operation of the plant at temperatures of up to 600 °C. Nitriding requires the use of hazardous gases such as ammonia, oxygen and nitrogen. Hydrogen is produced as a by-product and therefore safety was the most important design parameter. Thermohydraulic analyses, i. e. heat transfer and pressure drop calculations in pipes, were also performed to ensure the successful process design of the nitriding plant. The nitriding plant was subsequently constructed and operated to verify the correct design. A large amount of experimental and operating data was captured during the actual operation of the plant. This data was analysed and the thermohydraulic analyses were verified. Nitrided specimens were subjected to hardness and layer thickness tests. The measured temperature of the protruding <b>fan</b> <b>shaft</b> was within the limits predicted by Finite Element Analysis (FEA) models. Graphs of gas flow rates and other operation data confirmed the inverse proportionality between ammonia supply flow rate and measured dissociation rate. The design and operation of the nitriding plant were successful as a nitride layer thickness of 400 μm and hardness of 1 200 Vickers hardness (VHN) was achieved. This research proves that a large pressure vessel can successfully be nitrided using the vessel interior as a process chamber. Master...|$|E

40|$|A {{variable}} {{inlet guide}} van (VIGV) type convertible engine {{that could be}} used to power future high-speed rotorcraft was tested on an outdoor stand. The engine ran stably and smoothly in the turbofan, turboshaft, and dual (combined <b>fan</b> and <b>shaft)</b> power modes. In the turbofan mode with the VIGV open fuel consumption was comparable to that of a conventional turbofan engine. In the turboshaft mode with the VIGV closed fuel consumption was higher than that of present turboshaft engines because power was wasted in churning fan-tip airflow. In dynamic performance tests with a specially built digital engine control and using a waterbrake dynamometer for shaft load, the engine responded effectively to large steps in thrust command and shaft torque. Previous mission analyses of a conceptual X-wing rotorcraft capable of 400 -knot cruise speed were revised to account for more fan-tip churning power loss than was originally estimated. The new calculations confirm that using convertible engines rather than separate lift and cruise engines would result in a smaller, lighter craft with lower fuel use and direct operating cost...|$|R
