25|$|Foch, {{claiming}} that the Germans were showing signs of demoralisation, demanded (10 August) that Haig push on and capture the Somme crossings. Haig {{would have preferred to}} have First Army attack at Aubers and Third Army towards Bapaume, and after initially agreeing with Foch’s demand, changed his mind after consulting Currie and Lambert (GOC 32nd Division). Edmonds later claimed that Rawlinson was “almost insubordinate” in asking Haig whether he or “Marechal Foch” was in command, but this may not be an exact recollection as there is no record of the two men meeting that day. Haig told Byng (11 August) to be ready to attack with Third Army towards Bapaume and permitted Rawlinson to order a pause. Foch visited Haig’s command train that evening and concurred with the decision. Haig's initial orders to Rawlinson, to be ready to attack again after a short halt, have been criticised but Sheffield suggests that Haig had to defer to Foch this time, to clear the way for Byng’s attack. Haig then cancelled Fourth Army’s attack on Currie’s advice (based on aerial reconnaissance) that it would be “a desperate enterprise” for the BEF to overreach itself and engage new German troops with tired Allied ones who had outrun much of their artillery cover, and he switched to a new line of offensive. Haig wrote that on 15 August he “spoke to Foch quite straightly, and let him understand that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>responsible</b> for the handling of the British forces”. Foch {{had little choice but to}} agree, and interfered little with Haig’s decisions thereafter, but removed First French Army from Haig’s command.|$|E
500|$|... "Not Pictured" [...] {{would mark}} the final {{appearance}} by series regular Jackie Cook (Tessa Thompson). When asked whether Jackie {{was done with}} the show, Thomas replied, [...] "She is. I would not hesitate for a second to have her come in to do an arc, but she will not be a series regular." [...] One notable recurring character absence in the finale is that of Gia Goodman (Krysten Ritter). Ritter wanted to appear in the episode, but she was unable to do so because of scheduling conflicts. [...] "It was unfortunate for me that I couldn't be in the finale episode (I booked a pilot) because I was looking forward to showing how everything that went down affected her. On a side note, I did start to think that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>responsible</b> for the crash. I really wanted her to be a bad guy." [...] She would later appear in the Veronica Mars movie.|$|E

500|$|The Grove Book of Hollywood {{wrote that}} the 1978 film, The Wiz was {{influenced}} by Werner Erhard's teachings and est because actress Diana Ross and writer Joel Schumacher were [...] "very enamored of Werner Erhard." [...] The film's producer Rob Cohen noted that: [...] "before I knew it, the movie was becoming an est-ian fable full of est buzzwords about knowing {{who you are and}} sharing and all that. [...] I hated the script a lot. But it was hard to argue with Diana because she was recognizing in this script all of this stuff that she had worked out in est seminars." [...] Schumacher spoke positively {{of the results of the}} est training, saying: [...] "I will be eternally grateful for learning that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>responsible</b> for my life." [...] Of est and Erhard references in the film itself, The Grove Book of Hollywood notes that the speech delivered by the Good Witch, played by actress Lena Horne, at the end of the film was [...] "a litany of est-like platitudes," [...] and the book also makes est comparisons to the song [...] "Believe in Yourself." ...|$|E
500|$|Joel Schumacher's {{script for}} The Wiz was {{influenced}} by Werner Erhard's teachings and his Erhard Seminars Training ("est") movement, as both Schumacher and Diana Ross were [...] "very enamored of Werner Erhard".

[...] Of est and Erhard references in the film itself, The Grove Book of Hollywood notes that the speech delivered by Glinda the Good Witch at the end of the film was [...] "a litany of est-like platitudes", and the book also makes est comparisons to the song [...] "Believe in Yourself". Although Joel Schumacher had seen the Broadway play before writing the script, none of the Broadway play's writing was incorporated into the film's.|$|E
2500|$|Habib {{was raised}} in a female environment, his {{brothers}} being in Tunis and his father being old. Therefore, he spent his days with his mother, grandmother and sisters, Aïsha and Nejia, which permitted him to witness the household chores of women and the gender inequality with men. Bourguiba recounted his childhood in these words: [...] "I was the youngest of all. As such, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>responsible</b> for all chores. I was, in short, a domestic. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>responsible</b> for keeping the jug and pour water on the hands of my elders, after meals. But I was the elder of nobody, and I had to manage all by own with the hudge container in order to wash my hands". Another fact also marked the childhood of Habib Bourguiba: Being the youngest of the family, he had to address his elders, including his brothers with the word [...] "Sidi" [...] (ser). However, the designation of his sisters was a problem of protocol. Even though they were older, their female gender did not give them a right of presence on young Habib. His father Ali, soon found {{a solution to the problem}} arguing that they had to call themselves with their respective first name, [...] "no other difference hallmark". The young Habib soon noticed the low status of women in the beginning of the century.|$|E

2500|$|The second {{creation}} of the dukedom was in 1623 for George Villiers, a favourite of James I of England. He had previously been made Baron Whaddon, of Whaddon in the County of Buckingham, and Viscount Villiers in 1616, then Earl of Buckingham in 1617, then Marquess of Buckingham in 1618 until he was also created Earl of Coventry and Duke of Buckingham in 1623. Buckingham, who continued in office as chief minister into the reign of James's son, Charles <b>I,</b> <b>was</b> <b>responsible</b> for a policy of war against Spain and France. In 1628 he was assassinated by [...] John Felton, a disgruntled army officer who had served under him, as he prepared an expedition to relieve the Huguenots of La Rochelle.|$|E
2500|$|... "Practically {{since the}} day war broke out <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>responsible</b> for American publicity." [...] Parker played a crucial and {{significant}} role in British propaganda during World War I. [...] Due to his strategic marriage to Amy VanTine, reputation as a writer, and social status among the American people, he had established many friendships with influential Americans in all professions. [...] 2 September 1914, Parker was chosen by Charles Masterman and the British government to head the subdivision of Wellington House that was responsible for American propaganda. [...] He was unpaid and had no formal title for this role. [...] His goal was to convince America to support the British cause in the war. [...] He worked with {{the theory that the}} British cause could not be accomplished through [...] "violent wooing," [...] but must instead be efforts of [...] "gentle and modest courtship." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gregory was {{physically}} exhausted and {{worried that he}} was losing {{the confidence of the}} bishops and the emperor. [...] Rather than press his case and risk further division, he decided to resign his office: [...] "Let me be as the Prophet Jonah! [...] <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>responsible</b> for the storm, but I would sacrifice myself for the salvation of the ship. [...] Seize me and throw me... I was not happy when I ascended the throne, and gladly would I descend it." [...] He shocked the Council with his surprise resignation and then delivered a dramatic speech to Theodosius asking to be released from his offices. The emperor, moved by his words, applauded, commended his labor and granted his resignation. The Council asked him to appear once more for a farewell ritual and celebratory orations. Gregory used this occasion to deliver a final address (Or. 42) and then departed.|$|E
