5|$|On August 12, 1985, Japan Airlines Flight 123, a Boeing 747-146SR, {{suffered}} a rupture {{of the pressure}} bulkhead in its tail section, caused by undetected damage during a faulty repair to the rear bulkhead after a tailstrike seven years earlier. Pressurized air subsequently rushed out of the bulkhead and blew off the plane's vertical stabilizer, also severing all four of its <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> systems. The pilots were {{able to keep the}} plane airborne for 32 minutes using differential engine power, but without any hydraulics or the stabilizing force of the vertical stabilizer, the plane eventually crashed in mountainous terrain. There were only 4 survivors among the 524 on board. This accident is the deadliest single-aircraft accident in history.|$|E

25|$|Armstrong {{gathered}} many excellent {{engineers at}} Elswick.

Rendel introduced the cruiser as a naval vessel. There was great rivalry and dislike between Noble and Rendel, which became open after Armstrong’s death.|$|E

25|$|At {{the level}} of suspensions, the 250 GT Lusso had double {{wishbones}} and coil springs at the front, while the rear suspension comprised a live axle, leaf springs, semi-elliptical concentric coil springs and telescopic shock absorbers. Braking was provided by four-wheel disc brakes with <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control,</b> placed behind the polished aluminum Borrani wire wheels with single knockoffs.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was rebuilt, and resumed flight testing on 2 February 1965. On 8 September 1965, the aircraft suffered another fatal crash, once again {{while in a}} low altitude hover. The {{aircraft was}} being evaluated by United States Air Force Major P. E. Neale, {{as part of a}} Franco-American information exchange on VTOL programmes. Major Neale made an unsuccessful ejection outside the ejection seat's escape envelope. The findings of the accident investigation were never made public. It was speculated that <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> difficulties coupled with excessive use of the lift engines resulted in fuel starvation and the flameout of all nine engines. Once again, the damage was not irreparable, but this time the aircraft was not rebuilt, as flight development of the Mirage IIIV prototype was already underway.|$|E
25|$|Multi-cylinder {{hydraulic}} {{cone crusher}} is mainly composed of main frame, eccentric shaft, crushing cone, mantle, bowl liner, adjusting device, dust ring, transmission device, bowl-shaped bearing, adjusting sleeve, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> system, hydraulic safety system, etc. The electric motor of the cone crusher drives the eccentric shaft to make periodic swing movement under the shaft axis, and consequently surface of mantle approaches {{and leaves the}} surface of bowl liner now and then, so that the material is crushed due to squeezing and grinding inside the crushing chamber. The safety cylinder of the machine can ensure safety as well as lift supporting sleeve and static cone by a hydraulic system and automatically remove the blocks in the crushing chamber when the machine is suddenly stuffy. Thus the maintenance rate is greatly reduced and production efficiency is greatly improved as it can remove blocks without disassembling the machine.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{existing}} <b>hydraulic</b> pressure <b>control</b> {{fault diagnosis}} system is effective on fault detection, but the fault isolation capability is bad. In {{order to improve}} the capability of the fault isolation, the artificial neural network (ANN) {{is used in the}} fault diagnosis system. Aimed at the representative diagnosis of the <b>hydraulic</b> pressure <b>control</b> system, the three layers feedback network is adopted, the basic theory of conjugate gradient BP neural network is explained in detail, and the key techniques are introduced. Five types of typical faults of <b>hydraulic</b> pressure <b>control</b> system can be distinguished easily by it, the faults diagnosis efficiency is higher 30 % than ever and the fault diagnosis capability is better 80 % than before.
