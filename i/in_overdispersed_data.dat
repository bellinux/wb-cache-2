40|$|Overdispersion and {{correlation}} are two features often encountered when modeling non-Gaussian dependent data, usually as {{a function}} of known covariates. Methods that ignore the presence of these phenomena are often in jeopardy of leading to biased assessment of covariate effects. The beta-binomial and negative binomial models are well known <b>in</b> dealing with <b>overdispersed</b> <b>data</b> for binary and count data, respectively. Similarly, generalized estimating equations (GEE) and the generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) are popular choices when analyzing correlated data. A so-called combined model simultaneously acknowledges the presence of dependency and overdispersion by way of two separate sets of random effects. A marginally specified logistic-normal model for longitudinal binary data which combines the strength of the marginal and hierarchical models has been previously proposed. These two are brought together to produce a marginalized longitudinal model which brings together the comfort of marginally meaningful parameters and the ease of allowing for overdispersion and correlation. Apart from model formulation, estimation methods are discussed. The proposed model is applied to two clinical studies and compared to the existing approach. It turns out that by explicitly allowing for overdispersion random effect, the model significantly improves. (c) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. status: accepte...|$|R

In this thesis I propose some Bayesian nonparametric models for grouped data, which make use of dependent random probability measures. These probability measures are constructed by normalising infinitely divisible probability measures and exhibit nice theoretical properties. Implementation of these models is also easy, using mainly MCMC methods. An additional step in these algorithms is also proposed, in order to improve mixing. The proposed models are applied on both simulated and real-life data and the posterior inference for the parameters of interest are investigated, as well as the effect of the corresponding simulation algorithms. A new, n-dimensional distribution on the unit simplex, that contains many known distributions as special cases, is also proposed. The univariate version of this distribution is used as the underlying distribution for modelling binomial probabilities.

This paper deals with methods for <b>overdispersed</b> <b>data</b> using the negative binomial distribution resulting from a Poisson-Gamma mixture. We investigate the small sample properties of the likelihood-based tests and compare their performances to those of the t-test and of the Wilcoxon test. We also illustrate how these procedures may be used to compute power and sample sizes to design studies with response variables that are <b>overdispersed</b> count <b>data.</b> Although methods are based on inferences about two independent samples, sample size calculations may also be applied to problems comparing more than two independent samples. It will be shown that there is gain in efficiency when using the likelihood-based methods compared to the t-test and the Wilcoxon test. In studies where each observation is very costly, the ability to derive smaller sample size estimates with the appropriate tests is not only statistically, but also financially, appealing. ...|$|R

Methods We describe the statistical theories behind the beta-binomial model and the associated estimation methods. We supply information about statistical software that can provide beta-binomial estimations. Using a published example, we illustrate the application of the beta-binomial model when pooling <b>overdispersed</b> binomial <b>data.</b> Results <b>In</b> an example regarding the safety of oral antifungal treatments, we had 41 treatment arms with event rates varying from 0 % to 13. 89 %.

The parameters of the beta-binomial model took the values of 1. 24 for alpha and 34. 73 for beta. Conclusion The beta-binomial model can provide a robust estimate for the summary event rate by pooling <b>overdispersed</b> binomial <b>data</b> from different studies. The explanation of the method and the demonstration of its applications should help researchers incorporate the beta-binomial method as they aggregate probabilities of events from heterogeneous studies. </p...|$|R

Likelihood approaches {{include the}} Poisson mixtures with three distributions, the gamma, the lognormal, and the inverse Gaussian distributions.

In this simulation study, <b>overdispersed</b> count <b>data</b> were simulated under the Poisson mixtures with the gamma, the lognormal and the inverse Gaussian distributions, then analyzed {{with the five}} likelihood and non-likelihood approaches. Our results indicated that 1) when the count <b>data</b> are mildly <b>overdispersed,</b> there are virtually no differences in type I error rate, standard error of the main effect, and empirical power among the five methods; 2) when the count <b>data</b> are very <b>overdispersed,</b> none of these five approaches is robust to model misspecification as evaluated by type I error rate, standard error of the main effect, and empirical power. This simulation study raises caution on using non-likelihood method for analyzing very overdispered count data because of likely higher type I error and inappropriate power levels. Unlike non-likelihood approaches, likelihood approaches allow for statistical tests based on likelihood ratios and for checking model fit and provide basis for power and sample size calculations.

In contrast to the analysis of independent data, repeated measures analysis must account for dependencies between observations on the same subject. With respect to count <b>data,</b> the term <b>overdispersed</b> refers to <b>data</b> that violates the mean-variance equality of a Poisson distribution. While the analysis of data exhibiting either one of these two properties has been described extensively, methods for analyzing data exhibiting both properties are less well-understood. ^ The archetypal data set exhibiting these two properties is the so-called 2 ̆ 2 seizure data set. 2 ̆ 2 Many approaches to analyzing these data appear in the literature. The classes of models suggested range from fully parametric conditional models to semi-parametric marginal (or GEE-type) models. The natural question is: 2 ̆ 2 which, if any, of these methods should we use? 2 ̆ 2 Outside asymptotic theory, answering this question requires simulated data. Thus, study of the processes that plausibly give rise to such data is a crucial first step. ^ Probability processes for repeated measures data can generally be classified as observation driven or latent process approaches. Because probability processes for <b>overdispersed</b> count <b>data</b> inherently involve latent variables, the latter is more amenable to producing overdispersed repeated measures count data. Latent processes for producing <b>overdispersed</b> count <b>data</b> include Poisson processes conditioned on multivariate Gaussian variables and Poisson processes conditioned on multivariate gamma variables. The advantage of utilizing the former is the wide variety of multivariate Gaussian distributions available, while use of the latter aligns with methodology for producing independent, <b>overdispersed</b> count <b>data.</b> This thesis expands on multivariate gamma distributions, and examines the use of these distributions for producing overdispersed repeated measures count data. ^ Characterization of the probability processes provides a basis for simulating overdispersed repeated measures count data.
