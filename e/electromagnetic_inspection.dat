40|$|INTRODUCTION The use {{of giant}} magnetoresistive (GMR) sensors for {{electromagnetic}} nondestructive evaluation has grown considerably {{in the last}} few years [1 - 4]. Technological advances in the research and development of giant magnetoresistive materials has led to commercially available GMR sensors with many qualities well suited for electromagnetic NDE. Low cost GMR magnetometers are now available which are highly sensitive to the magnitude of the external magnetic field, have a small package size, consume little power, and operate at room temperature [5]. Incorporation of these sensors into electromagnetic NDE probes has widened the application range of the field. In particular, the low frequency sensitivity of the devices provides a practical means to perform <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>inspections</b> on thick layered conducting structures. The incorporation of a commercially available GMR sensor into the Self-Nulling Probe has been explored in the past [3]. This research showed that the modificatio...|$|R
40|$|On-site {{evaluation}} of corrosion damage is posing challenges to maintenance engineering as corrosion damage {{is difficult to}} be evaluated accurately and it has significant spatial variation. When measures are not taken, corrosion could lead to reduction of load caring capacity, large repair costs and in some extreme cases could lead to collapse of the structure. The present study proposes a multi-technology approach for effective {{evaluation of}} corrosion progress rate and of the damage extent, combining monitoring with periodic inspections. The progress of corrosion is estimated by Atmospheric Corrosion Monitoring (ACM) technology, and by ultrasonic (UT) and <b>electromagnetic</b> (EM) <b>inspection</b> technology. Continuous monitoring by Atmospheric Corrosion Monitoring (ACM) technology is being used for determining the overall environment corrosivity. Also, ACM helps to pinpoint areas on the structure where more aggressive local corrosion inducing factors exists.

40|$|It {{is clear}} from simple skin depth {{considerations}} that steady state <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>inspection</b> of thick multi-layered conductors requires low frequency excitation. Conventional pickup sensors, however, lose sensitivity at lower frequencies.

The geometrical information in pipeline application is different than the traditional EMT system. Here, we will only be interested in imaging the pipeline area (which is a concentric circle).

40|$|The great {{flexibility}} of ground-penetrating radar {{has led to}} consider worldwide this instrument as an effective and efficient geophysical tool in several fields of application. As far as pavement engineering is concerned, ground-penetrating radar is employed {{in a wide range}} of applications, including physical and geometrical evaluation of road pavements. Conversely, the mechanical characterization of pavements is generally inferred through traditional (e. g., plate bearing test method) or advanced non-destructive techniques (e. g., falling weight deflectometer). Nevertheless, measurements performed using these methods, inevitably turn out to be both much more time-consuming and low-significant whether compared with ground-penetrating radar’s potentials. In such a framework, a mechanical evaluation directly coming from <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>inspections</b> could represent a real breakthrough in the field of road assets management. With this purpose, a ground-penetrating radar system with 600 MHz and 1600 MHz center frequencies of investigation and ground-coupled antennas was employed to survey a 4 m× 30 m flexible pavement test site. The test area was marked by a regular grid mesh of 836 nodes, respectively spaced by a distance of 0. 40 m alongside the horizontal and vertical axes. At each node, the elastic modulus was measured using a light falling weight deflectometer. Data processing has provided to reconstruct a 3 -D matrix of amplitudes for the surveyed area, considering a depth of around 300 mm, in accord to the influence domain of the light falling weight deflectometer. On the other hand, deflectometric data were employed for both calibration and validation of a semi-empirical model by relating the amplitude of signal reflections through the media along fixed depths within the depth domain considered, and the Young’s modulus of the pavement at the evaluated point. This statistically-based model is aimed at continuously taking into account alongside the depth of investigation, of both the different strength provision of each layer composing the hot mix asphalt pavement structure, and of the attenuation occurring to electromagnetic waves during their in-depth propagation. Promising results are achieved by matching modelled and measured elastic modulus data. This continuous statistically-based model enables to consider the whole set of information related to each single depth, in order to provide a more comprehensive prediction of the strength and deformation behavior of such a complex multi-layered medium. Amongst some further developments to be tackled in the near future, a model improvement could be reached through laboratory activities under controlled conditions and by adopting several frequency bandwidths suited for purposes. In addition, the perspective to compare electromagnetic data with mechanical measurements retrieved continuously, i. e. by means of specifically equipped lorries, could pave the way to considerable enhancements in this field of research.

Such defects, if left unattended, can lead to wasteful losses of time, energy and money.

Alternating Current Field Measurement (ACFM) is an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>inspection</b> method {{which is}} now widely {{accepted}} {{as an alternative to}} magnetic particle inspection in the Oil and Gas Industry, both above and below water.

These have required developments in both hardware and software and generally utilise array technology. This paper will describe how the use of the ACFM technique has been extended over the past few years, including examples of specific developments in a range of industries including power generation, railways and shipping. The paper will also consider one of the spin-off technologies now being developed, known as the Alternating Current Stress Measurement (ACSM) technique.

40|$|Fiber {{waviness}} in laminated {{composite material}} is introduced during manufacture because of uneven curing, resin shrinkage, or ply buckling caused by bending the composite lay-up into its final shape prior to curing. The resulting waviness has a detrimental effect on mechanical properties, therefore this condition {{is important to}} detect and characterize. Ultrasonic characterization methods are difficult to interpret because elastic wave propagation is highly dependent on ply orientation and material stresses. By comparison, the pulsed terahertz response of the composite is shown to provide clear indications of the fiber waviness. Pulsed Terahertz NDE is an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>inspection</b> method that operates in the frequency range between 300 GHz and 3 THz. Its propagation is influenced by refractive index variations and interfaces. This work applies pulsed Terahertz NDE to the inspection of a thick composite beam with fiber waviness. The sample is a laminated glass composite material approximately 15 mm thick with a 90 -degree bend. Terahertz response from the planar section, away from the bend, is indicative of a homogeneous material with no major reflections from internal plies, while the multiple reflections at the bend area correspond to the fiber waviness.

40|$|Following {{numerous}} 954 ACSR SD Wire failures from 2010 to 2012, Nebraska Public Power District (NPPD) implemented {{an inspection}} program {{to determine the}} extent of condition for this type of widely used conductor. NPPD transmission system includes over 2000 miles of this particular conductor. Transmission line splices are installed every 15 - 20 spans, with failures being located in a span containing a splice. NPPD worked with Kinectrics to complete electromagnetic field inspections for three days in 2013, with retesting performed in 2015. Throughout this inspection of 54 spans of conductor, 36 were found to have deterioration and corrosion. Over 80 % of the corrosion noted in the report was found on a conductor span containing a splice; only 45 % of the spans tested contain a splice. All of the failures occurred in spans where a compression sleeve or compression dead-end was present. In all cases, only the steel core broke internal to trapezoidal aluminum wire layers. The results of the inspection indicated that there is a notable amount corrosion located in the few hundred feet at the center of the span. Removal of spans testing “marginal” occurred in April 2015, along with the physical evaluation of the conductor validating the results of the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>inspection</b> tool. None of the conductors were rated as poor, which would indicate no imminent failures exist. Since none of these localized areas were in poor condition, it could be several years before more frequent findings of broken wire and related problems are observed. Advisor: Jeffrey E. Shiel...|$|E

40|$|State-of-the-art imaging {{technologies}} for monitoring {{the integrity of}} oil and gas well bores are typically limited to inspection of metal casings and cement bond interfaces close to the first casing region. The objective {{of this study is to}} develop a novel well-integrity inspection system that is capable of providing enhanced information about the flaw structure and topology of hydrocarbon producing well bores. In order to achieve this, we propose the development of a multi-element <b>electromagnetic</b> (EM) <b>inspection</b> tool that can provide information about material loss in the first and second casing structure as well as information about eccentricity between multiple casing strings. Furthermore, the information gathered from the EM inspection tool will be combined with other imaging modalities (e. g. data from an x-ray backscatter imaging device). The independently acquired data are then fused to achieve enhanced accuracy compared to the sum of individual acquired data. A test rig composed of several concentric pipes was assembled and various defect structures in the metal casings were imaged. Initial test results were obtained with a scanning system that includes a transmitting coil and several receiving coils that are mounted on a single rod. A mechanical linear translation stage was used to move the EM sensors in the axial direction during data acquisition. For simplicity, a single sensor and repetitive scans were employed to simulate performance of a sensor array system. The resulting electromagnetic images enable the detection of metal defects that previously have been introduced into the steel pipes. Responses from several sensors were used to assess position and amount of material loss in the first and second metal pipe as well as magnitude of eccentricities between the two pipes. The results from EM measurements and x-ray backscatter simulations demonstrate that data fusion from several sensing modalities can provide an enhanced assessment of flaw structures in producing well bores and potentially allow for early detection of anomalies that if undetected might lead to catastrophic failures...|$|R

In the third reporting period, the rotating system inspection was further developed. Since this is a new inspection modality without published fundamentals to build upon, basic analytical and experimental investigations were performed. A closed form equation for designing rotating exciters and positioning sensors was derived from fundamental principles. Also signal processing methods were investigated for detection and assessment of pipeline anomalies. A lock in amplifier approach was chosen as the method for detecting the signals. Finally, mechanical implementations for passing tight restrictions such as plug valves were investigated. This inspection concept is new and unique; a United States patent application has been submitted. In this fourth reporting period, the rotating system inspection was further developed. A multichannel real-time data recorder system was implemented and fundamental experiments were conducted to provide data to aid in the design of the rotating magnetizer system. An unexpected but beneficial result was achieved when examining the separation between the rotating magnet and the pipe wall; separations of over an inch could be tolerated. Essentially no change in signal from corrosion anomalies could be detected for separations up to 1. 35 inches.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this contract between Oceaneering Space Systems (OSS) and the Department of Energy (DOE) {{was to provide a}} tool for the DOE to inspect the inside tank walls of underground radioactive waste storage tanks in their tank farms. Some of these tanks are suspected to have leaks, but the harsh nature of the environment within the tanks precludes human inspection of tank walls. As a result of these conditions only a few inspection methods can fulfill this task. Of the methods available, OSS chose to pursue Alternating Current Field Measurement (ACFM), because it does not require clean surfaces for inspection, nor any contact with the Surface being inspected, and introduces no extra by-products in the inspection process (no coupling fluids or residues are left behind). The tool produced by OSS is the Robotic Tank Inspection End Effector (RTIEE), which is initially deployed on the tip of the Light Duty Utility Arm (LDUA).
