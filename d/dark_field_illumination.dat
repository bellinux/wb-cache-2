40|$|In recent years, the {{development}} of portable microscopy devices that enable the noninvasive bedside evaluation of the mucosal microcirculation in critically ill patients has expanded the research on this level of the cardiovascular system.

In this manuscript, we aimed to compare the quality of sublingual microcirculatory image acquisition between the IDF and SDF devices. Methods: Using the microcirculatory image quality scoring (MIQS) system, (six categories scored as either 0 = optimal, 1 = acceptable, or 10 = unacceptable), two independent raters compared 30 films acquired using the Cytocam IDF video-microscope, to an equal number obtained with an SDF device. Blinded to {{the origin of the}} films, the raters were therefore able to score between 0 and 60 for each film analysed. The scores' distributions between the two techniques were compared. Results: The median MIQS (95 % CI) given to the SDF camera was 7 (1. 5 - 12), as compared to 1 (0. 5 - 1. 0) for the IDF device (p < 0. 0001). Of the six categories assessed by the MIQS, nearly one fifth of the SDF videos were scored as unacceptable for pressure (20 %), content (20 %), and stability (17 %), with focus scoring deficiently 13 % of the time.

40|$|Many {{pulse power}} {{applications}} in {{use at the}} Pegasus facility at the Los Alamos National Laboratory require specialized imaging techniques. Due to the short event duration times, visible images are recorded by high speed electronic framing cameras. Framing cameras provide the advantages of high speed movies of back light experiments. These high speed framing cameras require bright illumination sources to record images with 10 ns integration times. High power lasers offer sufficient light for back illuminating the target assemblies; however, laser speckle noise lowers the contrast in the image. Laser speckle noise also limits the effective resolution. This discussion focuses {{on the use of}} telescopes to collect images 50 feet away.
