5|$|On 24 March 1998, Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts, Senator Richard Alston, {{announced}} the government's {{decisions for the}} introduction of digital television. The plan allowed commercial and public broadcasters 7MHz of spectrum free of charge for 8 years to simulcast services in both digital and analog, after which {{it was to be}} returned to the Commonwealth. <b>Digital</b> <b>terrestrial</b> <b>television</b> was to commence on 1 January 2001 in metropolitan areas, with expansion to regional areas to have been completed by the start of 2004.|$|E

5|$|Ofcom awards {{licenses}} for digital radio services differently {{depending on the}} type of service and the platform. Ofcom advertises the licences of new digital radio ensembles and are subject to an open competition to the highest bidder. Ensemble licence awards are awarded for twelve years. To broadcast a service on a DAB ensemble, a station must hold a Digital Sound Programme Service licence from Ofcom. On digital television services, individual stations can apply for either a digital cable and satellite licence to broadcast on the aforementioned platforms, or apply for a digital terrestrial licence to broadcast on <b>digital</b> <b>terrestrial</b> <b>television.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Australian Broadcasting Authority's response, titled <b>Digital</b> <b>Terrestrial</b> <b>Television</b> Broadcasting, {{recommended}} that the Australian Government support the early introduction of digital broadcasting as a free-to-air service with the loan of a 7MHz channel for each broadcaster, in order to enable high-definition television from the outset. The Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations supported this, as well as freedom for its members to launch multi-channel services. At the same time, the Australian Subscription Television and Radio Association, questioned the commercial viability of HDTV, was opposed {{to the idea of}} multi-channeling, and argued for a competitive system that would allow the entry of new players.|$|E

25|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>terrestrial</b> <b>television</b> (DTTV or DTT) is a {{technological}} evolution of broadcast television and an advancement over analog television. DTTV broadcasts land-based (terrestrial) signals. The advantages of <b>digital</b> <b>terrestrial</b> <b>television</b> {{are similar to}} digital versus analog in platforms such as cable, satellite, and all telecommunications: the efficient use of spectrum and provision of more capacity than analog, better quality images, and lower operating costs for broadcast and transmission (after the initial upgrade costs). A terrestrial implementation of digital television (DTV) technology uses an aerial to broadcast to a conventional television antenna (or aerial) instead of a satellite dish or cable television connection.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A single {{frequency}} network (SFN) {{based on}} the DTMB (<b>Digital</b> <b>Television</b> <b>Terrestrial</b> Broadcasting System) <b>terrestrial</b> <b>digital</b> <b>television</b> (DTV) system normally causes interference among signals from multiple transmitters in the network. These transmitters should broadcast the same program at the same frequency simultaneously in the service area. To meet the SFN network construction requirements in complex transport situation, TS distribution network’s synchronization {{is one of the}} most important foundations. A design was proposed to insert into each MPEG-TS (SIP) packet with one absolute timestamp in the SFN adapter, which was proved to be valuable insuring the synchronization of the SFN TS distribution through field-test in Ningxia DTMB network...|$|R
