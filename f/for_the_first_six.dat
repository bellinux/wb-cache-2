5|$|After the Austro-Hungarian Navy {{had filled}} its most urgent needs for {{submarines}} after {{the outbreak of}} World War I, they selected the German Type UB II design for its next group of submarines in mid 1915. Orders <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> boats were placed in October 1915 with the Austrian firm of Cantiere Navale Triestino and the Hungarian firm of Ganz Danubius. Two more boats were ordered in 1916, bringing the class total to eight.|$|E
30|$|Analyzing {{the results}} of the tree methods and taking into account the {{isotropy}} of the Fourier transform we can observe the effects of Gaussian white noise decomposition <b>for</b> <b>the</b> three methods. Figure 4 a depicts <b>the</b> results <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first’s</b> <b>six</b> modes of a full two-dimensional Gaussian white noise decomposition using BEEMD, the results are in line with those obtained by Rilling et al. [12] and Damerval et al. [13]. Figure 4 b shows <b>the</b> results <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first’s</b> <b>six</b> modes of a full two-dimensional Gaussian white noise decomposition using LSEEMD, resulting in a filter bank over each separated horizontal line (noise image). Figure 4 c shows <b>the</b> results <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first’s</b> <b>six</b> modes of a full two-dimensional Gaussian white noise decomposition using our proposed method PHEEMD.|$|R

5|$|<b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> {{months of}} operation, the subway was {{operated}} {{as a single}} system, with trains from Eglinton Station running through to either Keele or Woodbine station, while other trains connected the latter two points. However, the manoeuvre made operation of both lines more difficult, and the practice was abandoned after the initial trial period, leaving Lower Bay Station abandoned.|$|E
5|$|<b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> {{years of}} their {{marriage}} the couple lived in her widowed father Hilarion's large home at 1823 Turk St in San Francisco. With {{the death of her}} father on November 17, 1901, Marion inherited the bulk of her grandfather's fortune, giving the couple independent means.|$|E
5|$|Almost every {{episode of}} Dexter's Laboratory {{is divided into}} three {{different}} stories/segments, each one being approximately 8 minutes in length. Occasionally, the middle segment centered on characters from the Dexter's Laboratory universe other than Dexter and his family. Two of these segments were shown primarily during the first season: Dial M for Monkey and The Justice Friends. Dial M for Monkey was the middle segment <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> episodes of season one, and The Justice Friends took its place {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E

5|$|Clark's {{relationships}} with the other characters evolved {{over the course of}} the show. Clark's relationship with Lex Luthor was symbolic, as the two shared a yin and yang type of relationship. In the pilot, Clark first saved Lex from drowning after a car accident; at the end of the episode, Lex saved Clark when he was strung up in the cornfield and immobilized by kryptonite. His relationship with Lex was tested by his lack of honesty, just like it was with Lana <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> seasons; the same could be said for Lex's dishonesty with Clark. Both characters wanted to be completely honest with each other, but knew they could not, which inhibited their friendship.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the war he}} was {{included}} in an Australian Imperial Forces cricket team, touring England in 1919. Charles Kelleway, an officer, was {{the captain of the}} team <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> matches. Despite Collins's rank Field Marshal Birdwood, the former commander of the Australian Corps, asked him to take over the captaincy {{for the remainder of the}} tour. Some of his colleagues were officers such as Jack Gregory and Nip Pellew. Collins proved a capable and popular skipper with the team losing only four of twenty eight matches during the tour. He scored 1,615 runs including five centuries at an average of 38.45 and took 106 wickets at 16.55 apiece.|$|E
5|$|<b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> {{periods of}} the {{periodic}} table, the noble gases {{are exactly the}} members of group18 of the periodic table. Noble gases are typically highly unreactive except when under particular extreme conditions. The inertness of noble gases makes them very suitable in applications where reactions are not wanted. For example, argon is used in light bulbs to prevent the hot tungsten filament from oxidizing; also, helium is used in breathing gas by deep-sea divers to prevent oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) toxicity.|$|E
50|$|Donald McKay was a Scottish footballer {{who played}} as a full-back for Southampton St. Mary's in 1896-97, when {{they won the}} Southern League title <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> of <b>six</b> {{occasions}} over the next eight years.|$|R

5|$|Hansa served {{abroad in}} the East Asia Squadron <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> {{years of her}} career. Along with Hertha, she contributed a landing party to the force that {{captured}} the Taku Forts during the Boxer Rebellion. In August 1904, she participated in the internment of the Russian battleship Tsesarevich after the Battle of the Yellow Sea during the Russo-Japanese War. After returning to Germany in 1906, she was modernized and used as a training ship in 1909, following {{the completion of the}} refit. At the outbreak of World War I, Hansa was mobilized into the 5th Scouting Group, but served in front-line duty only briefly. She was used as a barracks ship after 1915, and ultimately sold for scrapping in 1920.|$|E
5|$|Matthew Deady {{spent the}} next four years working for his father on the family farm, engaged in manual labor, while also reading {{extensively}} in his spare time. On February 17, 1841, he left home after a disagreement with his father and moved to Barnesville, Ohio. For four years he lived with the family of John Kelly, working as a blacksmith’s apprentice. Beginning in 1843, Deady attended Barnesville Academy, continuing his education there until four months beyond the time that his blacksmith apprenticeship ended. The apprenticeship had paid <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> months of school. At the school he earned a certificate that allowed him to become a teacher on July 7, 1845, from his instructor Nathan R. Smith.|$|E
5|$|The club colours {{have not}} always been sky blue. The {{predecessor}} club BK Idrott wore blue and white striped shirts and white shorts, and this kit was still used <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> months of 1910 after Malmö FF was founded. This was later changed to red and white striped shirts and black shorts to show that Malmö FF was a new, independent club. This colour combination has on occasion been used in modern times as the away kit. The present sky-blue kit was introduced in 1920. Since 2010 a small Scanian flag is featured {{on the back of the}} shirt just below the neck.|$|E

5|$|The first {{winners of}} the tournament were Aston Villa. The final was contested over two legs <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> years of the competition. During this period many First Division clubs refused to take part, {{allowing}} clubs from outside the First Division to regularly reach the final. The first club from outside the First Division to win the competition was Norwich City of the Second Division in 1962. Queen's Park Rangers and Swindon Town, both then of Division Three, matched this feat in 1967 and 1969 respectively. Sheffield Wednesday, then in the Second Division, became the last club to win the competition while competing outside the First Division, when they beat Manchester United in the 1991 final.|$|E
5|$|The injured Lindwall {{came out}} to bat at 365/7 without a runner to join Hassett, and {{appeared}} to be able to run twos and threes without significant difficulty. Hassett, who had scored only 30 runs in the first 75 minutes of the day, swept Laker for four and then hit him <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> of the match. The Australian vice-captain added 53 in the two hours of the morning session to reach lunch at 94. The tourists were unhurried and remained patient as they had bowled England out quickly on the first day and there was still sufficient time to force a result with less than half the playing time elapsed.|$|E
5|$|USS Cummings {{served in}} the Pacific Fleet in the late 1930s, {{participating}} in numerous individual and fleet training exercises. In 1940, she served on security patrols off the west coast. Cummings went on a goodwill visit to several ports in the South Pacific, including Auckland, New Zealand, and Tahiti. The destroyer was hit by fragments while docked in Pearl Harbor during the Japanese attack, and suffered a few casualties. She escorted convoys between Pearl Harbor and the west coast <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> months of World War II. In June 1942, she was transferred to convoy escort duties in the South Pacific until August, when she had an overhaul in San Francisco, {{and then returned to}} her role as a convoy escort in the South Pacific.|$|E

50|$|William Robert Ponting (1872 - 21 March 1952) was an English amateur footballer {{who played}} as a half-back for Southampton St. Mary's in 1896-97, when {{they won the}} Southern League title <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> of <b>six</b> {{occasions}} over the next eight years.|$|R
5|$|Discussions of {{takeover}} {{were held}} {{over the summer}} involving an Irish group, the Drumaville Consortium, led by Niall Quinn. They completed the takeover in July for £10 million as Quinn's group took 72.59% of the club's shares. During the 2006–07 season, Roy Keane took over as manager from chairman Niall Quinn, who served as manager <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> games of the season. Keane had a successful start to his managerial career with a 2–1 win over Derby County on 11 September 2006. On transfer window deadline day, Keane signed new players; Dwight Yorke, Liam Miller, Ross Wallace, Stanislav Varga, Graham Kavanagh and David Connolly. A 2–0 win over Leicester City on 1 January 2007 sparked an 18-game unbeaten streak for Sunderland, which was eventually ended on 21 April 2007 after a 3–1 defeat {{at the hands of}} Colchester United.|$|E
5|$|<b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> episodes, {{the show}} had five corners, or parts, which started with opening {{greetings}} from the hosts {{and went on}} to thoughts and impressions that listeners had about the show. This moved on to an informal talk between the hosts, followed by a section where entries previously submitted by listeners concerning their enthusiasm for Key were read by the hosts. The fourth corner concerned answering questions that had been submitted by listeners, and the final corner had Orito playing the flute; listeners could submit suggestions for songs he was to play. Two more corners were added starting with the seventh broadcast. The first corner added concerns scary stories that the hosts can tell themselves, or read from submissions by listeners, and was added partly because Hinoue enjoys such stories. The second corner added deals with submissions by listeners describing a new fictional character, and Hinoue takes these submissions and forms a new fictional character out of combining elements from multiple submissions together. During the broadcasts, tracks from the soundtracks released under Key Sounds Label play in the background.|$|E
5|$|Harvard University offered Holst a lectureship <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> {{months of}} 1932. Arriving via New York {{he was pleased}} {{to be reunited with}} his brother, Emil, whose acting career under the name of Ernest Cossart had taken him to Broadway; but Holst was dismayed by the continual attentions of press interviewers and photographers. He enjoyed his time at Harvard, but was taken ill while there: a {{duodenal}} ulcer prostrated him for some weeks. He returned to England, joined briefly by his brother for a holiday together in the Cotswolds. His health declined, and he withdrew further from musical activities. One of his last efforts was to guide the young players of the St Paul's Girls' School orchestra through one of his final compositions, the Brook Green Suite, in March 1934.|$|E
