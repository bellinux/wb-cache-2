25|$|The {{problem of}} evil is often phrased in the form: Why <b>do</b> <b>bad</b> <b>things</b> happen to good people?. Christianity teach {{that all people}} are {{inherently}} sinful due to the fall of man and original sin; for example, Calvinist theology follows a doctrine called federal headship, which argues that the first man, Adam, was the legal representative of the entire human race. A counterargument to the basic version of this principle is that an omniscient God would have predicted this, when he created the world, and an omnipotent God could have prevented it.|$|E

2500|$|Disney did {{not give}} Sparks {{limitations}} on the topics featured in The Last Song, which include underage drinking, infidelity, and terminal illness but Sparks says that Disney desired {{to work with him}} in part because [...] "they’ve read my novels.

I’ll certainly have love scenes in my novels, but they’re always between consenting adults.” Still, Sparks acknowledges that elements of the screenplay may have been toned down by the director or the studio after he finished. As dictated by the Writers Guild of America, Sparks receives full credit for his work although the amount of his original screenplay retained in the film is uncertain. For example, Sparks says the character of Marcus, leader of the gang of thugs, was likely altered for the film.|$|E

The Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg called her comments a [...] "stupid and crass generalisation". Nadhim Zahawi, Conservative MP, said: [...] "This is racism.

2500|$|Behaviorists explain {{personality}} {{in terms of}} the effects external stimuli have on behavior. [...] The approaches used to analyze the behavioral aspect of personality are known as behavioral theories or learning-conditioning theories. These approaches were a radical shift away from Freudian philosophy. One of the major tenets of this concentration of personality psychology is a strong emphasis on scientific thinking and experimentation. [...] This school of thought was developed by B. F. Skinner who put forth a model which emphasized the mutual interaction of the person or [...] "the organism" [...] with its environment. [...] Skinner believed children <b>do</b> <b>bad</b> <b>things</b> because the behavior obtains attention that serves as a reinforcer. For example: a child cries because the child's crying in the past has led to attention. [...] These are the response, and consequences. [...] The response is the child crying, and the attention that child gets is the reinforcing consequence. According to this theory, people's behavior is formed by processes such as operant conditioning. [...] Skinner put forward a [...] "three term contingency model" [...] which helped promote analysis of behavior based on the [...] "Stimulus - Response - Consequence Model" [...] in which the critical question is: [...] "Under which circumstances or antecedent 'stimuli' does the organism engage in a particular behavior or 'response', which in turn produces a particular 'consequence'?" ...|$|E

Coghlan calls the book [...] "a triumph" [...] but wishes Dawkins had a chapter entitled [...] "Why do people <b>do</b> <b>bad</b> <b>things</b> to others?" [...] saying [...] "The book provides a golden opportunity for Dawkins to ask whether we can evolve to treat one another more civilly. Alas, he doesn't seize it." [...] Coghlan also supports Dawkins [...] "encouraging readers to be bowled over by the stunning beauty of reality– a sentiment I thoroughly support. Too few of us wake up each day and reflect on how amazing {{it is that we}} are not only alive, but aware of being alive." [...] Phoebe liked the book, she writes [...] "I was unable to put the book down. I found myself enjoying learning exciting new facts and having old ones reinforced. It was definitely no repeat of the classroom scenario... Perhaps the book's greatest asset is that it manages to bring science to life. The vibrant illustrations reinforce this, as do the fun font styles... His style is colloquial, creating a relaxed, lighter tone." [...] Callum, who is closest to the intended age for the book, doesn't need to be persuaded about the bounds of reality, he writes: [...] "Miracles don't exist. Simple as that. The Magic of Reality hasn't changed my views on anything." ...|$|E
