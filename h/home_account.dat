In other words, it solves the problem of service providers needing to create and maintain accounts for external users who they may not know. Current implementations seem to either rely on SAML, the Security Assertion Markup Language, or PKI, where the latter is mainly popular for Grid services. However, there are some trends towards convergence, for example, the recent release of the Globus toolkit is SAML and XACML aware, and GridShib is another project that uses PKI for authentication and SAML for passing attributes for authorisation. Still, these projects do not use the full potential of SAML and XACML, so this paper focuses on a scalable approach using distributed attribute authorities to access Grid services. 14 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Fathers with {{children}} at <b>home</b> <b>account</b> {{for a substantial}} portion of the Canadian population. In contemporary Canada, a father’s role no longer consists of distant breadwinning, but rather actively engaging in a family-centered lifestyle and being more involved in child care. Extensive research has focused primarily on the experiences of mothers and given very little attention to involved fathers. This study sought out to explore how fathers understand and describe involved fatherhood. Six participants, who identified as engaged fathers, participated in conversational interviews. The findings suggest that daily interaction through child rearing and playing {{with children}} was viewed as part of the father role. As a result, fathers adjusted their paid work and leisure pursuits in order to “be there” for their children. Fathers resisted dominant gendered ideologies through completing ‘feminine’ domestic chores, providing emotional care, and taking full responsibility for children’s care throughout the week. Fathers also reproduced gendered norms, particularly during children’s play, and by not taking paid parental leave. This research found that fathers resisted and reproduced gendered roles, and negotiated numerous constraints to meet their fathering responsibilities, which did not consist of solely playing with children. Fathers’ involvement level is greatly influenced by leave policies in Canada; therefore changes to leave policies and pay equity are needed to support increased father involvement...|$|E

40|$|International audienceOver {{the last}} 25 years, flash floods in the South of France have killed almost 250 people. The {{protection}} of prone populations {{is a priority}} for the French government. It is also a goal of the 2007 European flood directive. However, no accurate database exists gathering the fatalities due to floods in France. Fatalities {{are supposed to be}} rare and hazardous, mainly due to individual behaviour. A Ph. D. work has initiated the building of a database gathering a detailed analysis of the circumstances of death and the profiles of the deceased(age, gender [...] .). The study area covers the French Mediterranean departments prone to flash floods over the period 1988 - 2015. This presentation details the main features of the sample, 244 fatalities collected through newspapers completed with field surveys near police services and municipalities. The sample is broken down between huge events that account for two thirds of the fatalities and "small" events (34 % of the fatalities). Deaths at <b>home</b> <b>account</b> for 35 % {{of the total number of}} fatalities, mainly during huge events. 30 % of fatalities are related to vehicles. The last part of the work explains the relations between fatalities and prevention and how better knowledge of flood-related deaths can help to improve flood prevention. The given example shows the relationship between flood forecasting and fatalities. Half of the deaths took place in a small watershed (< 150 km 2). It emphasizes the need for the dissemination of a complementary system of flash flood forecast based on forecasted rainfall depth and adapted to small watersheds...|$|E
40|$|Foodborne {{diseases}} {{are among the}} most widespread public health issues, killing about 2. 2 million people annually, and costing hundreds of billions of US dollars for governments, companies, families and consumers (WHO, 2007). In Brazil, foodborne diseases acquired in the <b>home</b> <b>account</b> for 55 % of notified outbreaks (BRASIL, 2012). Several studies have investigated aspects of consumer behaviour concerning food poisoning, mapping practices in the home, but it remains a challenge to obtain a full picture of the consumer contribution to food contamination (REDMOND and GRIFFITH, 2003). This study aimed to assess the risks of food contamination in the home. A questionnaire containing 140 questions concerning food safety knowledge, handling practices, personal hygiene and basic health care, covering the stages when the food is {{under the control of the}} consumer, was developed and used to gather data for analysis. Appropriate scores were attributed to the questions (consequences to food safety) and answers (likelihood of food contamination). A risk estimate algorithm and an appropriate risk ranking scale were used to assess the results. From August 2011 to March 2012, survey questionnaires were collected from 2, 775 consumers in Brazil across 19 out of 27 state capitals. The study found risky practices with the potential to lead to food poisoning occurrences in the domestic environment in the following handling steps: food transportation, food preparation, cooking and the handling of leftovers. The personal hygiene, age, formal education, family income and basic health care habits represented the factors most related to the risky practices of consumers, which could orientate food safety educational campaigns for the Brazilian population...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} be {{successful}} on the market, energy-saving measures for existing buildings need to be promoted with arguments that are directly relevant to the users. Initial marketing for energy retrofitting {{has been based on}} monetary profits from future energy savings. However, for most households in Europe, energy bills for the <b>home</b> <b>account</b> for only 3 - 4 percent of disposable income, hence are not a major concern. As a result of inappropriate promotion of energy savings for existing buildings, less than 1 percent of over 300. 000 projects certified by BREEAM are refurbishments. Apparently, the promotion of energy retrofitting needs to be based on different grounds. It has been shown that people are particularly attracted to the idea of increasing the comfort and appearance of their homes, rather than carbon savings or long-term monetary profits. Therefore, the goal in this paper was to analyze the potential of linking energy-efficiency to an increase in housing quality. The first step in the research was to study the current practise of energy upgrades of the existing building stock. Sixty case studies analyzed by International Energy Agency (IEA), under SHC Task 37, were taken as references. Based on these projects, the most frequent refurbishment interventions are: addition of thermal insulation, reconstruction of balconies, enlargement of window area and restructuring of the floor plan. Each of the four measures was analyzed in a separate chapter through various aspects of housing quality. It was concluded that the energy retrofitting can contribute to a higher aesthetic value of a building and to the comfort of its occupants. However, there are some possible negative outcomes of the actions as well, which might discourage people from making the investment. In terms of architecture, both the interior and exterior can benefit from the implementation of energy-saving measures. Due to large quantity of existing buildings, the visual results from these interventions will be dominant in the urban landscape and might even define a new style in architecture. The motive for writing this paper was to provide information about beneficial outcomes from building retrofits, thus help their promotion among the users. Even though this was achieved, the information is not structured in a way relevant for the users. A common user might ask: “What should I do to increase the air quality inside my apartment?” Therefore, further work on this matter should be directed towards organizing the information in a "user-friendly" way so that people can easily get informed on which energy-saving measures directly address their particular comfort requirements and to what extent. </p...|$|E
