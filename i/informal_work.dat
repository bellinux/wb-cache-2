5|$|In {{countries}} where {{women have to}} do paid work in order to feed their family, {{there is a lack}} of regulation and safety standards regarding female workers due to the large amount of <b>informal</b> <b>work</b> available. In Thailand for example, due to the severe economic crisis in 1997, many women have jobs in the informal industry, and often do home-based work so that they can do their domestic jobs concurrently with their paid jobs. This increases the work intensity by women doing more than one job at a time, and has been shown to have deteriorating effects on women's health.|$|E

500|$|Despite women's {{increasing}} {{participation in}} the work force, a gender division of labor persist. There are a number of constraints in the labor market that contribute to the double burden. [...] "Women are disproportionately represented in <b>informal</b> <b>work</b> and concentrated among lower-quality jobs within self-employment." [...] The informal market is generally precarious and characterized by low wages, few benefits, and a lack of social protections that are offered in the formal market. Even within the formal market, there is occupational segregation and a gender wage gap. Occupational segregation can be either horizontal or vertical: horizontal segregation limits women to certain sectors and occupations, while vertical segregation restricts them to particular positions within occupational hierarchies. Men and women are even found at different levels of the occupational hierarchy. The [...] "glass ceiling" [...] is the relative absence of women in senior or managerial positions due to institutional barriers and norms. Even in female-dominated occupations, men often occupy the more skilled and better paid positions.|$|E

2500|$|Impoverished {{workers are}} more likely to hold {{part-time}} jobs, move in and out of work, be migrant workers, or experience stress associated with being unemployed and searching unsuccessfully for unemployment, which all in turn affects health outcomes. According to the WHO, employment and working conditions greatly affect health equity (Kivimaki et al., 2003). [...] This occurs because poor employment conditions exposes individuals to health hazards, which {{are more likely}} for low-status jobs. Evidence confirms that high job demand, low control, and low rewards for effort in these low status jobs are risk factors for mental and physical health problems, such as a 50% excess risk of heart disease (Stansfeld & Candy, 2006). [...] The growing power of massive, conglomerate global corporations and institutions to set labor policy and standards agendas has disempowered workers, unions, and the job-seeking by subjecting these individuals to health-damaging working conditions. (EMCONET, 2007). [...] In high- income countries, there has been a growth in job insecurity and precarious employment arrangements (such as <b>informal</b> <b>work,</b> temporary work, part-time work, and piecework), job losses, and a weakening of regulatory protections. <b>Informal</b> <b>work</b> can threaten health through its precarious job instability, lack of regulation to protect working conditions and occupational health and safety. Evidence from the WHO suggests mortality is greater among temporary workers than permanent workers. (Kivimaki et al., 2003). [...] Since most of the global workforce operates under the informal economy, particularly low- and middle-income countries, impoverished populations are greatly affected by these factors.|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} study is to address the void in the informal learning literature by developing and validating an instrument to measure employees' perceptions of <b>informal</b> learning <b>work</b> contexts. Under the assumption that qualitative research findings have provided the literature with sufficient insights into <b>informal</b> learning <b>work</b> contexts, it was time to generalize the findings across a larger population. Thus, the following four components of <b>informal</b> learning <b>work</b> contexts identified in the literature were empirically examined: (a) perceptions of management support; (b) perceptions of peer support; (c) perceptions of a supportive organizational culture; and (c) perceptions of access to work resources. There were four phases in the development and validation of the <b>informal</b> learning <b>work</b> context instrument. In the first phase, the initial item pool was created. In the second phase, content validity analysis resulted in the newly developed survey, which was administered to 2, 500 working professionals online. A total of 477 participants completed the survey (a response rate of approximately 19 %). In the third phase, a combination of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) revealed a good model-fit for six final constructs: management support, peer support, a supportive organizational culture, access to work resources, impact of informal learning on performance, and impact of informal learning on engagement. In the fourth phase, correlation and multiple regression analyses revealed perceptions of peer support as the only construct of <b>informal</b> learning <b>work</b> contexts that was positively related to the impact of informal learning on performance. Management support, peer support, and a supportive organizational culture were positively related to impact of informal learning on engagement. The findings of this study confirm the value of continuing exploration - using both quantitative and qualitative research methods - on <b>informal</b> learning <b>work</b> contexts. Knowledge about how informal learning can be promoted and leveraged in work settings will enable HRD practitioners to help organizations achieve the status of learning organizations. In turn, the HRD field will gain recognition and will be acknowledged as a significant force in business settings...|$|R

While the lost income is within a relatively close percentage, females were more likely, on average to fall below the official poverty line.
