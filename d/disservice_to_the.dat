After {{the success of}} Magic, Wizards published RoboRally in 1994, and it soon won the 1994 Origins Awards for Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Board Game and Best Graphic Presentation of a Board Game. Wizards also expanded its role-playing game line by buying SLA Industries from Nightfall Games and Ars Magica from White Wolf, Inc. in 1994. In 1995, Wizards published another card game by Richard Garfield, The Great Dalmuti, which won the 1995 Best New Mind Game award from Mensa. In August 1995, Wizards released Everway and then four months later closed its roleplaying game product line.

500|$|Attanasio, Levinson and Fontana {{strove to}} make Homicide more {{realistic}} than other police dramas, even in minor details. For example, Levinson specifically asked that {{a dead body}} found by detectives in [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] be badly decomposing and attracting flies because he felt other shows did not portray corpses in a realistic way. Some episodes, like [...] "Ghost of a Chance", focus on murders {{that take place in}} wealthy rural settings, rather than an urban or predominantly poorer location as most police dramas did. Homicide was noted for demonstrating better than most American television police shows that murders can take place in various socioeconomic circumstances. In striving for realism, some cases in Homicide remain unsolved and murderers go free, most notably in the Adena Watson case. This theme often put the show's producers at odds with NBC executives, who wanted happier endings with more closure. Fontana said of the Watson investigation, [...] "We never solved it because we felt {{that it would be a}} <b>disservice</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> real girl, to have this fake TV solution. Because it's not O.K. that she died, that no one took responsibility." ...|$|E

Elements of the interview in [...] "Three Men and Adena" [...] were incorporated from real-life police interrogations in that case. The Wallace case was never solved, and Fontana insisted that the Watson case in Homicide remain unsolved as well, despite pressure from NBC for a more satisfying conclusion. Fontana said, [...] "We never solved it because we felt that it would be a <b>disservice</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> real girl, to have this fake TV solution.

[...] The scene when Tucker admits for a moment he is not sure in his own mind that he didn't commit the murder was inspired by a similar real-life interaction Fontana found in a police interrogation transcript during his research. Fontana said, [...] "It was so chilling (and) I was like, 'Oh man, how do you get there?'" ...|$|E

Due to backlogs at Sony Disc Manufacturing, Atlus delayed the release of the game by over three weeks to October 12. In compensation, DoubleJump Books offered free priority shipping worldwide for their Nocturne guidebook. The publishing rights in Europe were picked up by Midas Interactive, who published the game through their then-newly formed subsidiary Ghostlight under the title Shin Megami Tensei: Lucifer's Call. It released on July 1, 2005. Nocturne was the first Megami Tensei title to be released in Europe.

Under the guise of development the Bretton Woods institutions (World Bank and the International Monetary Fund) promised to apply technological solutions and modernizing beliefs to fix poverty and to help women achieve their goals for economic independence.

Moreover, some individuals have adopted poor body image (i. e., being dissatisfied with body size and shape despite being thin by social standards). Three women who I have worked with, for example, weighed around 100 pounds, were assessed at 12 - 15 % body fat, and appeared to me to have an ideal body type. However, after they taught their aerobic classes, one would run for miles, another used diet pills to curb her appetite, and still another drank slim fast and worked out incessantly.

2500|$|It can {{therefore}} be argued that it does a <b>disservice</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> English-speaking reader to translate the title as The Antichrist at all. As has been said the German title Der Antichrist is open to two interpretations ('Antichrist'/'Anti-Christian') but the English The Antichrist is not, and thus the question becomes: does that title reflect Nietzsche's use of the German word in the text? In fact, Nietzsche employs the word Antichrist at only one point, and there its sense is clearly 'Anti-Christian.' He uses its plural Antichristen once also, and again the meaning is 'anti-Christians.' In fact, at no point in the text does Nietzsche use any form of the German word Christ other than to mean 'Christian.' On this approach, a reader would be better readied for book's content were its title rendered [...] "The Anti-Christian", which more accurately identifies the author's chosen foe. After all, even to acknowledge {{the existence of an}} Antichrist, let alone to portray oneself as one, presupposes the existence of a Christ, of a Messiah. Nietzsche recognized no such entity.

[...] His amendment garnered little support, and was rejected outright by a wide majority. In the end, the vast majority of the 1700 convention delegates supported the Lewis motion, with a show of hands. The motion backed a one-Canada stand, and really gave the party's establishment a free-hand on how to prepare a more detailed position for the up-coming federal election, since the motion also made the party's−establishment controlled−Federal Council responsible for producing that policy. After the Quebec wing's defeat on the Quebec motion, Laliberté refused to state whether they would leave the party, only suggesting that it would be dealt with at their June provincial convention.|$|E
