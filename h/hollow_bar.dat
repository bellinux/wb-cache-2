50|$|Bars and CollarsFrom {{the early}} 1930s {{until the early}} 1950s, BUR sold a {{standard}} 1-1/16” bar. Collars were attached separately. Most, if not all, of these bars were knurled in 3 places. None had a separate revolving sleeve. There were no markings on the BUR bars or collars to distinguish these from the bars or collars of other manufacturers. Bar lengths ranged from 4’ to 6’.In the 1950s, {{with the introduction of}} the BUR-140, BUR began selling a bar with a 1” diameter and a removable 38” chrome plated sleeve that allowed for bar rotation during lifts. BUR oversized inner collars were included with the new bar. These collars were stamped “BUR BARBELL Co LYNDHURST NEW JERSEY”.Finally, for a brief period during the 1950s, BUR also offered a 10-pound <b>hollow</b> <b>bar</b> with welded on end-caps.|$|E

50|$|Soil nailing is a {{construction}} remedial measure to treat unstable natural soil slopes or as {{a construction}} technique {{that allows the}} safe over-steepening of new or existing soil slopes. The technique involves the insertion of relatively slender reinforcing elements into the slope - often general purpose reinforcing bars (rebar) although proprietary solid or hollow-system bars are also available. Solid bars are usually installed into pre-drilled holes and then grouted into place using a separate grout line, whereas hollow bars may be drilled and grouted simultaneously {{by the use of}} a sacrificial drill bit and by pumping grout down the <b>hollow</b> <b>bar</b> as drilling progresses. Kinetic methods of firing relatively short bars into soil slopes have also been developed. Bars installed using drilling techniques are usually fully grouted and installed at a slight downward inclination with bars installed at regularly spaced points across the slope face. A rigid facing (often pneumatically applied concrete, otherwise known as shotcrete) or isolated soil nail head plates may be used at the surface. Alternatively a flexible reinforcing mesh may be held against the soil face beneath the head plates. Rabbit proof wire mesh and environmental erosion control fabrics and may be used in conjunction with flexible mesh facing where environmental conditions dictate.|$|E
5000|$|Most metal {{produced}} by a steel mill or aluminium plant is formed (via rolling or extrusion) into long continuous strips of various size and shape. These strips are cut at regular intervals and allowed to cool, each segment becoming a piece of bar stock. A good analogy is pasta-making, in which lumps of dough are extruded into various cross-sectional shapes; cut into lengths; and then dried in that form. The cross-sectional shapes of pasta vary from simple bar or tube shapes (such as linguine or penne) to more elaborate extrusions (such as rotelle, fiori, or rotini). The {{same is true of}} metal bar stock. The most common shapes are round bar (also called rod), rectangular bar (including square bar, the special case of equal sides), and hexagonal bar (usually called hex bar for short). Tube and pipe are similar, but have hollow centers and are traditionally not called [...] "bar" [...] in industrial usage. (However, a product called <b>hollow</b> <b>bar,</b> essentially tube but with custom-orderable OD and ID and thus custom wall thickness, is marketed for lathe bar work which can benefit from obviation of drilling and rough boring.)

40|$|The use of {{hollow core}} bars in micropiles has greatly {{increased}} {{over the past ten}} years. Hollow core construction, also known as “self drilled”, is becoming a popular option because it allows a faster installation processes and ground improvement at the same time. Despite the growing demand for <b>hollow</b> <b>bar</b> micropiles, little work has been devoted to evaluating the nominal bond strength between the micropile grout and the surrounding soil, especially in clayey soils. Moreover, the performance of such micropiles under different kinds of loading is still largely unknown and needs to be investigated. In this study, a research methodology encompassing two primary elements is adopted. The first element is a series of full scale field studies on <b>hollow</b> <b>bar</b> micropiles installed in cohesive soils, while the second is numerical investigations on <b>hollow</b> <b>bar</b> micropiles. To accomplish the study, four hollow core micropiles were installed using an air flushing technique employing large drilling carbide bits. Twenty-two load tests were conducted on the four <b>hollow</b> <b>bar</b> micropiles. The <b>hollow</b> <b>bar</b> micropiles were loaded in four consecutive phases, which included; five axial monotonic, five axial cyclic load tests on single micropiles, four axial monotonic tests on pairs of <b>hollow</b> <b>bar</b> micropiles, two monotonic and six cyclic lateral tests on single micropiles.

40|$|Micropiles {{are used}} in various applications, {{including}} low capacity micropile networks, underpinning and seismic retrofitting of existing foundations and high capacity foundations for new structures. They facilitate fast installation {{with a high degree}} of ground improvement. The current Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) design guidelines designate <b>hollow</b> <b>bar</b> micropiles as Type B micropiles, even though their construction technique is different than typical Type B, which results in overly conservative design. In addition, the current practice for construction of <b>hollow</b> <b>bar</b> micropiles is limited to drilling bit/hollow bar diameter ratio of 2. 5 or less. In this thesis, full-scale load tests were conducted in order to: evaluate the suitability of FHWA design guidelines to <b>hollow</b> <b>bar</b> micropiles installed in cohesive soil; and to evaluate the performance of <b>hollow</b> <b>bar</b> micropiles constructed with drilling bit/hollow bar diameter ratio of 3. The load tests included axial monotonic and cyclic axial loading and monotonic lateral loading. Eight micropiles were constructed using 76 mm (3 in) hollow bars (76 mm OD and 48 mm ID) with air/water flushing technique and advanced to a depth of 5. 75 m: six micropiles were installed using 228 mm (9 in) drill bit and two micropiles were installed using 178 mm (7 in) drill bit. All micropiles were instrumented with vibrating wire strain gauges to measure the axial strain at three stations along the micropile shaft. The axial load test results are presented and discussed in terms of load-displacement curves and load transfer mechanism. The load tests results showed that the grout/ground bond strength values proposed by FHWA (2005) for Type B micropiles grossly underestimate the bond strength for calculating the ultimate capacity. In addition, the toe resistance can be significant for micropiles resting on sand due to the increased toe diameter. No stiffness degradation was observed in the micropile capacity after applying 15 load cycles. Finally, lateral capacity of micropiles is moderate due to their small diameter. However, the larger drilling bit resulted in enhanced lateral performance and increased capacity due to the larger diameter. In addition, using fibre reinforced grout can increase the micropile lateral capacity and enhance its ductility...|$|E

Previously, we extended {{the methods used}} by the Colormark tracking system to several interventional devices using a real-time, three-dimensional (3 -D) ultrasound system. These results showed {{that we needed to}} improve the efficiency and reliability of the tracking. In this paper, we describe an analytical model to predict the transverse vibrations along the length of an atrial septal puncture needle to enable design improvements of the tracking system. We assume the needle can be mod-eled as a <b>hollow</b> <b>bar</b> with a circular cross section with a fixed proximal end and a free distal end that is suspended vertically to ignore gravity effects. The initial results show an ability to predict the natural nodes and antinodes along the needle using the characteristic equation for free vibra-tions. Simulations show that applying a forcing function to the device at a natural antinode yields an order of mag-nitude larger vibration than when driving the device at a node. Pulsed wave spectral Doppler data was acquired along the distal portion of the needle in a water tank using a 2 -D matrix array transesophageal echocardiography probe. This data was compared to simulations of forced vibrations from the model. These initial results suggest that the model is a good first order approximation of the vibrating device in a water tank. It is our belief that knowing the location of the natural nodes and antinodes will improve our ability to drive the device to ensure the vibrations at the proximal end will reach the tip of the device, which in turn should improve our ability to track the device in vivo.

40|$|Iron Carbonate {{is a novel}} carbon-negative {{sustainable}} binder that is {{made from}} metallic iron powder waste and utilizes the chemistry of iron carbonation. To produce the binder, usually landfilled iron powder and other constituents (fly ash, limestone powder, metakaolin, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, powdered organic reducing agent, and water) are mixed together and exposed to a pressurized CO 2 regime that leads to slow external diffusion. The carbonation of iron particles results {{in the formation of}} complex iron carbonates that have binding capabilities and mechanical properties similar or better compared to ordinary Portland cement (OPC) - based binders. The metallic particulate phase incorporated in the novel binders’ microstructure increases the toughness of Iron Carbonate because of the energy dissipation by plastic deformation of the unreacted and elongated iron particles which are strong and ductile. In addition, the matrix contains other additives including harder fly ash particles, softer limestone particles, and ductile clayey phases which significantly influence the overall fracture performance of the novel sustainable binder. ^ Understanding the behavior of Iron Carbonate at high strain rates is important {{for a wide range of}} both military and civilian applications. The material behavior under highly dynamic conditions is significantly different from the material response under quasi-static conditions. The split Hopkinson (Kolsky) pressure bar (SHPB) system is used to test dynamic compressive mechanical response and failure behavior of Iron Carbonate under high strain rates to establish exceptional dynamic load mitigation characteristics for the carbon-negative sustainable binder under extreme combined environments. ^ Dynamic tests are conducted on cylindrical Iron Carbonate specimens using a conventional SHPB set-up. The experimental arrangement includes a gas gun and three steel bars (a striker bar, an incident bar, and a transmitted bar), aligned along a single axis. The Iron Carbonate specimen is placed between the incident and transmitted bar and the striker projectile is fired toward the face of the incident bar. Due to the impact of the striker bar an incident pulse, a reflected pulse and a transmitted pulse are generated that build up the stress level in the specimen and compress it. Objective of the carried out dynamic compression tests on Iron Carbonate specimen is the determination of the stress equilibrium, true stress-strain plots and strain-rate. ^ Analysis of the obtained pulses revealed that the transmitted pulses of the tested Iron Carbonate specimens were of much smaller magnitude than the incident and reflected pulses. As a result, achievement of stress equilibrium and homogeneous deformation of the Iron Carbonate samples was prevented. The small amplitude of the transmitted pulses is due to the possibly low mechanical impedance of Iron Carbonate. Testing specimens made of material with low mechanical impedance allows the incident bar-specimen interface to nearly move freely under stress wave loading, so that most of the incident pulse is reflected backward into the incident bar. Only a small portion of the loading pulse is transmitted through the specimen into the transmission bar [...] ^ Therefore, the conventionally used experimental standard set-up of the SHPB system using steel bars has to be modified in order to determine accurate dynamic stress-strain responses for Iron Carbonate. To increase the magnitude of the transmitted pulses a softer material, such as aluminum, should be used as transmitted bar material instead of common steel. Furthermore, a hollow transmitted bar instead of a solid bar should be used. The lower Young’s modulus of an aluminum alloy and the smaller cross-section of the <b>hollow</b> <b>bar</b> increase the amplitude of the transmitted strain signals by at least an order of magnitude as compared to a conventional steel bar. ...|$|E

The new design uses a U shaped striker bar as projectile and addresses several shortcomings of classical SHTB designs using <b>hollow</b> striker <b>bars.</b> The results presented show that the non-symmetrical striker bar is capable of generating a clean and virtually oscillation free square pulse signal five times longer than typically achieved by classical striker tubes, whilst {{at the same time}} offering superior signal quality. Due to the longer stress pulse duration, the new SHTB design allows for the characterisation of materials at strain rates that were difficult to achieve for hydraulic testing machines and classical striker tube based SHTB designs. In addition, the developed SHTB is based on a simple and modular design and allows {{for a wide range of}} pulse shaping methodologies to be applied. Therefore, materials requiring different input stress pulse shapes, such as square (ductile), trapezoid or triangular (brittle), can be experimentally characterised at a large range of strain rates. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Ultralight hollow microlattice {{materials}} offer tremendous {{potential for}} energy dissipation, {{thanks to a}} unique form of structural damping associated with local buckling of the <b>hollow</b> <b>bars.</b> This dissertation provides a comprehensive study of this damping mechanism and exploits it {{for the design of}} hollow microlattices with superior combinations of stiffness and damping at low mass. To encompass a wide design space, both metallic and hybrid (metal/elastomer) hollow microlattices are investigated. This structural damping mechanism is studied in detail and a simple mechanical model is developed and validated by experimental characterization. The model is adopted to optimize the microlattice geometry for maximum values of a damping figure of merit, expressing optimal combinations of high stiffness, low density and high damping coefficient. We find that hollow metallic microlattices exhibit exceptionally large values of this figure of merit; however, this level of performance requires extremely low relative densities (< 0. 1 %), thus limiting the actual amount of energy dissipated. In order to increase the damping figure of merit at higher densities, hollow microlattices with metal/elastomer/metal sandwich walls are investigated. The sandwich construction provides increased local buckling strength, thus increasing the amount of energy dissipated by the lattice in a loading cycle. At the same time, the elastomer provides additional energy dissipation through the classic intrinsic constrained-layer damping mechanism, which is active even at relatively high densities and low deformation amplitudes. An analytical model for stiffness and damping (both intrinsic and structural) of hybrid hollow microlattices is derived, and verified via Finite Elements analyses and experimental characterization. Finally, the model is adopted in optimal design studies to identify hybrid microlattices with ideal combinations of the same figure of merit used for metallic lattices. The results indicate that hybrid lattices are clearly superior. Over the course of this work, significant discrepancies between predicted and measured values of the mechanical properties (e. g., stiffness, strength) of ultralight hollow microlattices were consistently observed. Such discrepancies are attributed to a complex stress state around the hollow nodes and the existence of a variety of manufacturing-induced geometric imperfections (e. g. cracks, non-circularity of the bars). The ultralight nature of the lattices investigated in this study makes them particularly sensitive to these defects. Here, a detailed study of such imperfections is performed with the aim of quantifying their effects on the mechanical performance of the lattices. The results confirm that the major discrepancy between analytical and experimental results can indeed be attributed to manufacturing-induced imperfections...|$|R

The modeled piles consist of 20 mm diameter, 200 mm length, made up of single pile, 4 No pile group of 2 × 2 with centre to centre a= 4 d, and 9 No pile group of 3 × 3 with centre to centre a= 3 d, were driven into clearly marked layered clay soils differentiated by w= 20 %, γ= 17 kN/m 3 for the weak; w= 10 %, γ= 19 kN/m 3 for the strong) while the third class of reinforced weak layer had <b>hollow</b> reinforcing <b>bars</b> placed in it. The tests were conducted in a specially designed testing equipment/tank. The modeled piles were subjected to axial compressive loads at incremental rate of 0. 01, 0. 05, 0. 1 and 1 mm/min respectively. A linear relationship was observed between the load incremental rate and pile axial capacity and pile displacement, which were also visible from the increase in the radius of curvature of the displaced/deformed soil from the pile centre-line...|$|R

All detections {{were carried out}} by differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry (DPASV). The method involves microextraction and pre-concentration of Zn (II) on the pseudo stir <b>bar</b> <b>hollow</b> fiber. Then desorption has been done using suitable solvent containing suitable ligand as complexing agent. The optimized conditions were obtained. The relationship between the peak current and concentration was linear over the range of 0. 05 – 500  ng mL− 1. The limit of detection was 0. 015  ng mL− 1. Under the optimized conditions, the pre-concentration factor is 5140. The applicability of the developed technique was evaluated by application to spiked, environmental water samples...|$|R
40|$|The {{function}} of stabilizer bars in motor vehicles {{is to reduce}} the body roll during cornering. This project looks into the performance of stabilizer bar with respect to their stress variations at corner bends and weight optimization. The focus is on the stress concentration at the corner bends of a stabilizer bar, that is designed for an automotive vehicle, which is reduced by optimizing the shape of the critical regions in two types of stabilizer bars, one is solid and other is hollow. In order to do this, parameters which constitute the geometry of the stress concentrated regions are determined. The effect of these parameters on stress concentration is evaluated by using Design of Experiments (DOE) approach and parametric correlations. Possible design options and their corresponding mass and maximum equivalent stress values are obtained by using FiniteElement Analysis. The results are assessed by means of response surfaces generated by FEA software. FE analyses showed {{that it is possible to}} decrease the maximum equivalent stress at the critical regions for solid and <b>hollow</b> stabilizer <b>bar</b> by 11 % and 12 % respectively with a mass increase of 3. 75 % and 3. 45 % respectively. Transition form that gives optimum stress concentration is determined...|$|R
