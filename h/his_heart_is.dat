60|$|All {{this was}} {{wormwood}} to our old friend.

Despite his efforts, the baby does not come to and is driven off in an ambulance, where <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> found to be beating weakly.

25|$|Back at the diner, Hook enlists Robin into a plan {{to check}} Emma's house and see what she had in the basement. As Granny hands Belle a dinner plate, Belle, to her surprise, notices her rose's petals being restored, a sign that Mr. Gold is waking up, but when she returns to the pawnshop, he's not there.

25|$|An {{interlude}} follows {{with the}} Snow Queen and Kay talking in her ice palace throne room. Kay {{is playing with}} ice crystals when the Snow Queen asks him if he knows what love is.

While the coach travels through a dark woods, they are stopped by a gang of robbers, who take Gerda and strip the coach of its gold plate, sparing the attendants.

These pets include a fox, little rabbits, the birds that were spared the Snow Queen's frost earlier, and a large reindeer, named Bucky Boy. The birds tell Gerda that they saw the Snow Queen take Kay with her to Lapland. The reindeer offers to take Gerda there. It remains for the robber girl to let Gerda and Bucky Boy go, which she does. She also releases the birds, the fox, and the rabbits, but they decide to stay with her.|$|E
25|$|Viki is {{diagnosed}} with breast cancer in 2000, but survives after a mastectomy and chemotherapy. She and Ben marry in November. In 2001, a girl named Natalie Balsom (Melissa Archer) makes the startling claim that she is Viki and Clint's biological daughter, which is confirmed by a DNA test. Mitch Laurence returns from the dead, divulging to Viki he drugged and raped her around the same time she and Clint conceived Jessica and had unknowingly become pregnant with fraternal twins, one fathered by Clint, Natalie, and the other fathered by Mitch, Jessica (Erin Torpey). Unable to reconcile the revelation, Niki Smith emerges during the ordeal and plots to kill Ben in order to have her freedom, but when Ben is accidentally shot by Antonio Vega (Kamar de los Reyes), Viki returns. Ben is left comatose after the shooting. In 2003, Victor (William Stone Mahoney) is ostensibly revealed to be alive, claiming to have faked his death in 1976; however, shortly after he returns, Victor dies — but not before Viki and Todd confront him on ills inflicted to them in his wake. In 2004, Viki {{is diagnosed}} with heart disease and eventually needs a heart transplant. Coincidentally, a comatose Ben dies just as Viki takes a turn for the worse, and <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> transplanted into Viki, who recovers but must face widowhood once again.|$|E

25|$|The 19th century Italian writer Arturo Graf {{gives this}} version of the legend in his 1889 book Il Diavolo : There was once a duchess of Normandy who was tormented with a desire to have {{children}} and yet could have none. Weary of recommending herself to God, who will not listen to her, she betakes herself to the Devil, and her wish is speedily satisfied. A son is born to her, a veritable firebrand. As an infant, he bites his nurse and tears out her hair; as a lad, he knifes his teachers; at the age of twenty, he becomes a bandit chief. He is dubbed knight, in the belief that thus the wicked instincts raging within him may be overcome; but thereafter he is worse than he was before. No one surpasses him in strength or in courage. In a tourney he overthrows and slays thirty opponents; then he goes roaming about the world; then he returns to his native land, and begins once more to play the bandit, robbing, burning, murdering, ravishing. One day, after cutting the throats of all the nuns of a certain abbey, he remembers his mother and goes in search of her. Soon as they spy him, the servants take to their heels, scattering in all directions; not one tarries to ask him whence he comes or what he desires. Then, {{for the first time in}} his life, Robert is astounded at the horror which he inspires in his fellow-beings; for the first time, he becomes conscious of his own monstrous wickedness, and he feels how <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> pierced by the sharp tooth of remorse. But why is he wickeder than other men? Why was he born thus? Who made him what he is? An ardent longing seizes him to unravel this mystery. He hastens to his mother, and with drawn sword he adjures her to unveil to him the secret of his birth. Learning this, he becomes frantic with terror, shame, and grief. But his sturdy nature is not weakened; he does not yield to despair; instead, the hope of a laborious redemption, of a marvelous victory, urges and spurs on his proud spirit. He will learn to conquer Hell, to subdue himself, to thwart the designs of that accursed fiend who created him to serve his own ends, who has made of him a docile instrument of destruction and of sin. And he makes no delay. He goes to Rome, casts himself at the feet of the pope, makes confession to a holy hermit, submits himself to the harshest kind of penance, and swears that henceforth he will taste no food that he has not first wrested from the jaws of a dog. On two separate occasions, when Rome was besieged by the Saracens, he fights incognito for the Emperor and gains the victory for the Christians. Recognized at last, he refuses all rewards and honors, the imperial crown, even the monarch's own daughter, goes away to dwell with his hermit in the wilderness, and dies a saint, blessed by both God and men. In other accounts, he finally weds the beautiful princess who is deeply in love with him.|$|E
500|$|When Spring's girlfriend, Lee Jones, {{is killed}} in [...] "Conversations with the Dead", {{the task of}} {{investigating}} the murder is handed to Chief Inspector Colin Devis of the London Metropolitan Police, [...] "one of the Department's all-time cretins". Devis' pursuit of the killer, {{an agent of the}} British Secret Service, costs him his job but Spring compensates him by hiring him, at the rank of Inspector, for the ISPF. Although Devis is not the sharpest investigator, <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> in the right place and he is fiercely loyal to Spring. Overweight, sexist and bigoted, five times married Devis is the series' main comedy element and frequently gets the best lines.|$|E
500|$|Yount {{would fill}} a wagon full of freshly killed game, and then sell the meat in {{towns such as}} Laramie and Cheyenne. According to Ingersoll, Yount was quite careful about his {{personal}} appearance: [...] "his belt, holster, knife-sheath, bridle, and saddle are all set off with a barbaric glitter." [...] Yount paid a Shoshone woman to decorate his buckskin jacket, [...] "a marvel of fringes, fur trimming and intricate embroidery of beads." [...] Ingersoll wrote that Yount was [...] "by nature a gentleman, and under his sinewy frame and tireless strength, there is a heart as tender as a girl's, which hates the cruelty his profession unavoidably occasions. [...] His eye is open to every beautiful feature of the grand world in which he lives; <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> alive to all the gentle influences of the original wilderness." [...] Ingersoll's 1883 book, Knocking 'Round the Rockies, describes Yount in a similar fashion.|$|E
