5|$|The massive, compact {{nature of}} a white dwarf {{produces}} a strong surface gravity. Astronomers denote this value by the decimal logarithm of the <b>gravitational</b> <b>force</b> in cgs units, or log g. For IK Pegasi B, log g is 8.95. By comparison, log g for the Earth is 2.99. Thus the surface gravity on IK Pegasi is over 900,000 times the <b>gravitational</b> <b>force</b> on the Earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{break-up}} {{velocity of}} a star is an expression {{that is used to}} describe the case where the centrifugal force at the equator is equal to the <b>gravitational</b> <b>force.</b> For a star to be stable the rotational velocity must be below this value.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, Newton's law of universal gravitation had been accepted for more than two hundred years as a valid description of the <b>gravitational</b> <b>force</b> between masses. In Newton's model, gravity is the result of an attractive force between massive objects. Although even Newton was troubled by the unknown nature of that force, the basic framework was extremely successful at describing motion.|$|E
50|$|The {{ratio of}} {{electrostatic}} to <b>gravitational</b> <b>forces</b> between two particles will be {{proportional to the}} product of their charge-to-mass ratios. It turns out that <b>gravitational</b> <b>forces</b> are negligible on the subatomic level, due to the extremely small masses of subatomic particles.|$|R
5|$|The {{shape and}} {{energy of the}} land is {{significantly}} affected by <b>gravitational</b> <b>forces.</b> On a large scale, the distribution of <b>gravitational</b> <b>forces</b> on the earth is uneven and influences the shape and movement of tectonic plates as well as influencing geomorphic processes such as orogeny and erosion. These forces govern many of the geophysical properties and distributions of ecological biomes across the Earth. On the organismal scale, <b>gravitational</b> <b>forces</b> provide directional cues for plant and fungal growth (gravitropism), orientation cues for animal migrations, and influence the biomechanics and size of animals. Ecological traits, such as allocation of biomass in trees during growth are subject to mechanical failure as <b>gravitational</b> <b>forces</b> influence the position and structure of branches and leaves. The cardiovascular systems of animals are functionally adapted to overcome pressure and <b>gravitational</b> <b>forces</b> that change according to the features of organisms (e.g., height, size, shape), their behaviour (e.g., diving, running, flying), and the habitat occupied (e.g., water, hot deserts, cold tundra).|$|R
50|$|Gravity {{spreading}} in passive margins {{occurs when}} <b>gravitational</b> <b>forces</b> {{are strong enough}} to overcome the overburdens resistance to motion along its basal surface, and the internal strength. The <b>gravitational</b> <b>forces</b> are a function of the dip of the slope and the dip of the décollement layer.|$|R
5|$|A slow-rotating {{white dwarf}} star can not exceed the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.44 solar masses without {{collapsing}} to form a neutron star or exploding as a Type Ia supernova. Once the white dwarf reaches this mass, such as by accretion or collision, the <b>gravitational</b> <b>force</b> would exceed the pressure exerted by the electrons. If the white dwarf is rotating rapidly, however, the effective gravity is diminished in the equatorial region, thus allowing the white dwarf to exceed the Chandrasekhar limit. Such rapid rotation can occur, for example, {{as a result of}} mass accretion that results in a transfer of angular momentum.|$|E
5|$|A third {{suggested}} alignment {{was some}} sort of planetary conjunction occurring on 21 December 2012; however, there was no conjunction on that date. Multi-planet alignments did occur in both 2000 and 2010, each with no ill result for the Earth. Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System; larger than all other planets combined. When Jupiter is near opposition, the difference in <b>gravitational</b> <b>force</b> that the Earth experiences is less than 1% of the force that the Earth feels daily from the Moon.|$|E
5|$|Hydroelectricity is {{the term}} {{referring}} to electricity generated by hydropower; the production of electrical power {{through the use of}} the <b>gravitational</b> <b>force</b> of falling or flowing water. In 2015 hydropower generated 16.6% of the worlds total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity and is expected to increase about 3.1% each year for the next 25 years. Hydroelectric plants have the advantage of being long-lived and many existing plants have operated for more than 100 years.|$|E
50|$|The {{discourse}} {{does not}} include <b>gravitational</b> <b>forces</b> in its theory to explain the Earth's orbit and does not consider {{the relation between the}} ocean and cosmic <b>gravitational</b> <b>forces,</b> like that of the moon. Occurring invisibly, gravity was far too mystic for Galileo's consideration. Galileo did end the Discourse on the Tides with reservations that his theory may be incorrect and the hope that further scientific investigation will confirm his proposal. Still, his 1632 Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems omitted <b>gravitational</b> <b>forces</b> and included a reprisal of his tidal theory in its fourth section.|$|R

5|$|In Newton's {{description}} of gravity, the <b>gravitational</b> <b>force</b> {{is caused by}} matter. More precisely, it {{is caused by a}} specific property of material objects: their mass. In Einstein's theory and related theories of gravitation, curvature at every point in spacetime is also caused by whatever matter is present. Here, too, mass is a key property in determining the gravitational influence of matter. But in a relativistic theory of gravity, mass cannot be the only source of gravity. Relativity links mass with energy, and energy with momentum.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario Galaxy is set {{in outer}} space, where Mario travels through {{different}} galaxies to collect Power Stars, earned by completing missions, defeating a boss, or reaching a particular area. Each galaxy contains planetoids and orbiting structures for the player to explore. Each astronomical object has its own <b>gravitational</b> <b>force,</b> allowing the player to completely circumnavigate the planetoids, walking sideways or upside down. The player can usually jump from one independent object and fall towards another one nearby. Although the main gameplay is in 3D, there are several areas in the game in which the player's movements are restricted to a 2-dimensional plane.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of a star begins with gravitational instability within a molecular cloud, caused by regions of higher density – often triggered by compression of clouds by radiation from massive stars, expanding bubbles in the interstellar medium, the collision of different molecular clouds, or the collision of galaxies (as in a starburst galaxy). When a region reaches a sufficient density of matter to satisfy the criteria for Jeans instability, it begins to collapse under its own <b>gravitational</b> <b>force.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{deviation}} of Earth's gravity field {{from that of}} a homogeneous sphere and <b>gravitational</b> <b>forces</b> from Sun/Moon will in general perturb the orbital plane. For a sun-synchronous orbit the precession of the orbital plane caused by the oblateness of the Earth is a desirable feature {{that is part of the}} mission design but the inclination change caused by the <b>gravitational</b> <b>forces</b> of Sun/Moon is undesirable. For geostationary spacecraft the inclination change caused by the <b>gravitational</b> <b>forces</b> of Sun/Moon must be counteracted by a rather large expense of fuel, as the inclination should be kept sufficiently small for the spacecraft to be tracked by a non-steerable antenna.|$|R
5|$|The {{origin of}} this pulsar planet is still uncertain, but it {{probably}} did not form where it is found today. Because of the decreased <b>gravitational</b> <b>force</b> when the core of star collapses to a neutron star and ejects most of its mass in a supernova explosion, {{it is unlikely that}} a planet could remain in orbit after such an event. It is more likely that the planet formed in orbit around the star that has now evolved into the white dwarf, and that the star and planet were only later captured into orbit around the neutron star.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} is a metric {{theory of}} gravitation. At its core are Einstein's equations, which describe {{the relation between}} the geometry of a four-dimensional, pseudo-Riemannian manifold representing spacetime, and the energy–momentum contained in that spacetime. Phenomena that in classical mechanics are ascribed to the action of the force of gravity (such as free-fall, orbital motion, and spacecraft trajectories), correspond to inertial motion within a curved geometry of spacetime in general relativity; there is no <b>gravitational</b> <b>force</b> deflecting objects from their natural, straight paths. Instead, gravity corresponds to changes in the properties of space and time, which in turn changes the straightest-possible paths that objects will naturally follow. The curvature is, in turn, caused by the energy–momentum of matter. Paraphrasing the relativist John Archibald Wheeler, spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.|$|E
5|$|Growing {{the star}} will {{increase}} its <b>gravitational</b> <b>force,</b> {{which increases the}} number of planets the solar system can have. They will {{also be able to}} attract solar systems composed of stars with lower mass than that of the player, or being attracted to stars with bigger mass. If both stars collide, they will be reduced to a lesser size within the same type of object. For example, if the player controls a small star and collides against a medium star, the player will be disintegrated while the AI-controlled star will be reduced to a small star. Being reduced from small star to life planet is not possible, as well as being reduced from small planet to asteroid. In these cases, the player is respawned, with random mass, close to the place where they collided.|$|E

5|$|The {{evolution}} of moon systems {{is driven by}} tidal forces. A moon will raise a tidal bulge in the object it orbits (the primary) due to the differential <b>gravitational</b> <b>force</b> across diameter of the primary. If a moon is revolving {{in the same direction}} as the planet's rotation and the planet is rotating faster than the orbital period of the moon, the bulge will constantly be pulled ahead of the moon. In this situation, angular momentum is transferred from the rotation of the primary to the r{{evolution of}} the satellite. The moon gains energy and gradually spirals outward, while the primary rotates more slowly over time.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of a stable star {{is in a state}} of hydrostatic equilibrium: the forces on any small volume almost exactly counterbalance each other. The balanced forces are inward <b>gravitational</b> <b>force</b> and an outward force due to the pressure gradient within the star. The pressure gradient is established by the temperature gradient of the plasma; the outer part of the star is cooler than the core. The temperature at the core of a main sequence or giant star is at least on the order of 107 K. The resulting temperature and pressure at the hydrogen-burning core of a main sequence star are sufficient for nuclear fusion to occur and for sufficient energy to be produced to prevent further collapse of the star.|$|E
5|$|While {{remaining}} upright may be {{the primary}} goal of beginning riders, a bike must lean in order to maintain balance in a turn: the higher the speed or smaller the turn radius, the more lean is required. This balances the roll torque about the wheel contact patches generated by centrifugal force due to the turn with that of the <b>gravitational</b> <b>force.</b> This lean is usually produced by a momentary steering in the opposite direction, called countersteering. Countersteering skill is usually acquired by motor learning and executed via procedural memory rather than by conscious thought. Unlike other wheeled vehicles, the primary control input on bikes is steering torque, not position.|$|E
40|$|The {{size and}} speed of a running animal {{determine}} {{the relative importance of}} <b>gravitational</b> and inertial <b>forces.</b> A small, rapidly moving animal, such as a mouse, can easily overcome <b>gravitational</b> <b>forces</b> to run up a tree. A much larger, relatively slower-moving elephant, in contrast, is constrained by gravity and would face dire consequences if it were to fall. To run over ground, any animal must overcome both <b>gravitational</b> <b>forces</b> to support its body weight and inertial forces to decelerate and accelerate its body mass. Body weight and body mass reflect the <b>gravitational</b> <b>forces</b> and inertial forces acting on the animal, respectively. Since changes in body weight, under natural circumstances, are the result of proportional changes in body mass, it is difficult to dissociate the independent influence of gravity from that of inertia.

5|$|All of {{the forces}} in the {{universe}} are based on four fundamental interactions. The strong and weak forces are nuclear forces that act only at very short distances, and {{are responsible for the}} interactions between subatomic particles, including nucleons and compound nuclei. The electromagnetic force acts between electric charges, and the <b>gravitational</b> <b>force</b> acts between masses. All other forces in nature derive from these four fundamental interactions. For example, friction is a manifestation of the electromagnetic force acting between the atoms of two surfaces, and the Pauli exclusion principle, which does not permit atoms to pass through each other. Similarly, the forces in springs, modeled by Hooke's law, are the result of electromagnetic forces and the Exclusion Principle acting together to return an object to its equilibrium position. Centrifugal forces are acceleration forces that arise simply from the acceleration of rotating frames of reference.|$|E
5|$|Compared with {{planets and}} other astronomical bodies, {{the objects of}} {{everyday}} life (people, cars, houses, even mountains) have little mass. Where such objects are concerned, the laws governing the behavior of test particles are sufficient to describe what happens. Notably, in order to deflect a test particle from its geodesic path, an external force must be applied. A chair someone is sitting on applies an external upwards force preventing the person from falling freely towards {{the center of the}} Earth and thus following a geodesic, which they would otherwise be doing without matter in between them and the center of the Earth. In this way, general relativity explains the daily experience of gravity {{on the surface of the}} Earth not as the downwards pull of a <b>gravitational</b> <b>force,</b> but as the upwards push of external forces. These forces deflect all bodies resting on the Earth's surface from the geodesics they would otherwise follow. For matter objects whose own gravitational influence cannot be neglected, the laws of motion are somewhat more complicated than for test particles, although it remains true that spacetime tells matter how to move.|$|E
5|$|String {{theory is}} a {{theoretical}} framework that attempts to reconcile gravity and quantum mechanics. In string theory, the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. String theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other. In a given version of string theory, {{there is only one}} kind of string, which may look like a small loop or segment of ordinary string, and it can vibrate in different ways. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string will look just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. In this way, all of the different elementary particles may be viewed as vibrating strings. One of the vibrational states of a string gives rise to the graviton, a quantum mechanical particle that carries <b>gravitational</b> <b>force.</b>|$|E
