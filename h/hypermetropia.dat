6000|$|With {{respect to}} the eye itself, the highest {{authority}} in England, Mr. Bowman, has been so kind as {{to give me the}} following remarks on certain inherited imperfections. First, <b>hypermetropia,</b> or morbidly long sight: in this affection, the organ, instead of being spherical, is too flat from front to back, and is often altogether too small, so that the retina is brought too forward for the focus of the humours; consequently a convex glass is required for clear vision of near objects, and frequently even of distant ones. This state occurs congenitally, or at a very early age, often in several children of the same family, where one of the parents has presented it. (12/16. This affection, as I hear from Mr. Bowman, has been ably described and spoken of as hereditary by Dr. Donders of Utrecht, whose work was published in English by the Sydenham Society in 1864.) Secondly, myopia, or short-sight, in which the eye is egg-shaped and too long from front to back; the retina in this case lies behind the focus, and is therefore fitted to see distinctly only very near objects. This condition is not commonly congenital, but comes on in youth, the liability to it being well known to be transmissible from parent to child. The change from the spherical to the ovoidal shape seems the immediate consequence of something like inflammation of the coats, under which they yield, and there is ground for believing that it may often originate in causes acting on the individual affected (12/17. M. Giraud-Teulon has recently collected abundant statistical evidence, 'Revue des Cours Scientifiques' September 1870 page 625, showing that short sight is due to the habit of viewing objects from a short distance, c'est le travail assidu, de pres.) and may thenceforward become transmissible. When both parents are myopic Mr. Bowman has observed the hereditary tendency in this direction to be heightened, and some of the children to be myopic at an earlier age or in a higher degree than their parents. Thirdly, squinting is a familiar example of hereditary transmission: it is frequently a result of such optical defects as have been above mentioned; but the more primary and uncomplicated forms of it are also sometimes in a marked degree transmitted in a family. Fourthly, CATARACT, or opacity of the crystalline lens, is commonly observed in persons whose parents have been similarly affected, and often at an earlier age in the children than in the parents. Occasionally more than one child in a family is thus afflicted, one of whose parents or other relations, presents the senile form of the complaint. When cataract affects several members of a family in the same generation, it is often seen to commence at about the same age in each: e.g., in one family several infants or young persons may suffer from it; in another, several persons of middle age. Mr. Bowman also informs me that he has occasionally seen, in several members of the same family, various defects in either the right or left eye; and Mr. White Cooper has often seen peculiarities of vision confined to one eye reappearing in the same eye in the offspring.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} refractive error management on resolution of accommodative esotropia, deterioration of accommodative esotropia, and {{the natural history of}} <b>hypermetropia</b> in accommodative esotropia. Methods: Retrospective cohort study and nested case-control study of patients with accommodative esotropia untreated prior to diagnosis by the author. Eligibility criteria included esodeviation of ≥ 10 prism diopters (PD) on distance and near fixation on initial examination, <b>hypermetropia,</b> distance esodeviation < 10 PD with full cycloplegic refraction correction on first follow-up examination, and at least 2 years of follow-up. Results: The study included 285 patients with mean follow-up of 102 months. After age 7 years, mean annual decrease in <b>hypermetropia</b> was. 24 D for patients wearing full cycloplegic refraction and for patients in whom <b>hypermetropia</b> was undercorrected by 1. 00 D or more. Age at diagnosis (P <. 0001), oblique muscle dysfunction (P <. 0001), and abnormal distance-near relationship (P =. 007) were associated with deterioration of accommodative esotropia. Of 51 patients with an intermittent abnormal distance-near relationship, 19 (37 %) had increased <b>hypermetropia</b> on cycloplegic refraction, and prescription of the increased correction normalized the distance-near relationship. Conclusions: The possibility that undercorrecting <b>hypermetropia</b> speeds its resolution is not supported by this study. Accommodative esotropia is usually stable, but younger age at diagnosis, oblique muscle dysfunction, and abnormal distance-near relationship are associated with deterioration. Undercorrection of <b>hypermetropia</b> can cause an abnormal distance-near relationship, which in turn can cause deterioration of accommodative esotropia.

40|$|Atkinson {{has shown}} that early {{correction}} of <b>hypermetropia</b> reduces the incidence of esotropia. If esotropia is reduced by prescribing glasses early, the rate of esotropia-induced amblyopia can be similarly reduced; this would have important economic consequences. We have studied (1) how costs compare to benefits in early visual screening, (2) how videorefraction as used by Atkinson compares to retinoscopy, and (3) whether esotropia {{is more likely to}} occur in children who have increasing as opposed to decreasing <b>hypermetropia.</b> The costs of the study so far have been high. It was exceedingly difficult to get all infants invited, come to the clinic and examined. Videorefraction did not compare favourably with retinoscopy in terms of costs and precision, whereas the amount of skill and time needed was approximately equal. The third question, whether esotropia is more likely to occur in children who have increasing as opposed to decreasing <b>hypermetropia,</b> arose from the controversy whether, in the general population, refraction increases or decreases during the first years of life. We found that papers reporting a decrease of <b>hypermetropia</b> in early childhood were studies of large cross-sections of the general population, whereas papers that reported an initial increase originated from ophthalmological practices or strabismus departments. These conflicting results could be reconciled by assuming a population bias: if esotropia is more likely to occur in children with increasing <b>hypermetropia,</b> children with increasing <b>hypermetropia</b> will preferentially be seen by ophthalmologists. It seems natural that children with increasing <b>hypermetropia</b> are more likely to squint, because additional accommodation, needed to overcome increasing <b>hypermetropia,</b> will inevitably confer additional convergence. This relationship has meanwhile been confirmed by others...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The Retinoic Acid Receptor Alpha (RARA) gene is a {{potential}} candidate gene for myopia due to its differential expression in animal models during experimentally induced myopia. To test for whether RARA is associated with myopia we have undertaken a case-control study assessing for associations between RARA and myopia, <b>hypermetropia,</b> and ocular biometric measures. Methods: A total of 802 Anglo-Celtic individuals were genotyped. Five tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) in RARA with an r 2 of 0. 8 and a minor allele frequency greater than 5 % were selected for genotyping. Genotype frequencies of these 5 tSNPs were compared between individuals with emmetropia and those with myopia or <b>hypermetropia.</b> A quantitative analysis was also performed to assess associations with ocular biometric measures including axial length, corneal curvature and anterior chamber depth. Results: We did not identify any significant association between tSNPs in RARA with either myopia or <b>hypermetropia</b> as qualitative traits. Neither did we identify any significant associations of these tSNPs with the quantitative traits of axial length, corneal curvature and anterior chamber depth. Conclusions: This is the first study to assess for associations between RARA and myopia, <b>hypermetropia,</b> and ocular biometric measures.

All those who remained with severely defective acuity in spite of treatment had either + 3 - 50 or more dioptres of meridional <b>hypermetropia</b> or 4 or more dioptres of meridional myopia at age 1 year. These children were identifiable in the 3 - 7 % of the population at age 1 year who showed high refractive errors. Squint as such was not so accurately predictable.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{identify}} {{the effect of}} infant <b>hypermetropia</b> on residual amblyopia in children remaining after treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 879 strabismic children had cycloplegic retinoscopy {{at the age of}} 6 months and later when strabismus was diagnosed. A total of 26 hypermetropes consistently wore glasses from the age of 6 months, and 305 other hypermetropes had their accommodation periodically assessed by dynamic retinoscopy before strabismus was diagnosed. The relation between the last known visual acuity after treatment and all other clinical findings was analysed using t-tests and regression analysis. RESULTS: Vision less than 6 / 12 in nonfixing eyes was associated with infantile <b>hypermetropia</b> > + 5. 0 D, and in rare instances in excess of - 3. 0 D of myopia. In hypermetropes only, anisometropia was associated with worse amblyopia. Astigmatism was associated with myopia and low levels of <b>hypermetropia</b> but not with worse vision. The vision of fixing eyes that were hypermetropic was significantly worse than that of emmetropic or myopic eyes. Wearing spectacles from the age of 6 months was associated with better vision in the nonfixing eye. Vision in the nonfixing eye of 19 hypermetropic heterotropes who started wearing glasses between 6 and 18 months of age also was better than that of those who started wearing glasses after 18 months of age. Insufficiency of accommodation was related to the degree of infantile <b>hypermetropia,</b> to worse vision and to failure to emmetropise. Difference in amplitude of accommodation between the eyes was largest in hypermetropes with anisometropia > + 1. 50 D and was marginally associated with worse vision in microtropes who became anisometropic after infancy. <b>Hypermetropia</b> decreased more in fixing eyes than in nonfixing eyes, thereby causing anisohypermetropia to increase after infancy. This change was most pronounced in hypermetropic microtropes. Conversely, failure of fixing eyes to emmetropise was associated with an increase in their inability to accommodate and heterotropia. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of these findings, severe residual amblyopia in children remaining after treatment could be explained by additional vision deprivation. It can be reduced by starting spectacle correction of <b>hypermetropia</b> before the age of 18 months. Anisometropia seemed the result of deficient emmetropisation...|$|E

Data were analyzed using the statistical software SPSS version 22. 0. The mean spherical equivalent values of regimen 1 (atropine 1 %) and regimen 2 (cyclopentolate 1 % and tropicamide 1 %) were presented as mean and standard deviation. A P ≤ 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results: One hundred and twenty-six eyes of 63 subjects aged 5 - 12 years were examined. The mean spherical equivalent values for regimen 1 and regimen 2 for the right eyes were 4. 73 ± 2. 1 DS and 4. 54 ± 1. 9 DS, respectively (P = 0. 59).

Conclusion: The combination of 1 % cyclopentolate and 1 % tropicamide could be a useful alternative to atropine 1 % for cycloplegic refraction in children with <b>hypermetropia...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{this series}} amblyopia, uncorrectable by {{spectacles}} and occlusion, was highly likely (48 %) {{if a child}} had + 3. 50 or more dioptres of meridional <b>hypermetropia</b> at age 1 year. 45 % of children with this refraction also had a squint. All those who remained with severely defective acuity in spite of treatment had either + 3. 50 or more dioptres of meridional <b>hypermetropia</b> or 4 or more dioptres of meridional myopia at age 1 year. These children were identifiable in the 3. 7 % of the population at age 1 year who showed high refractive errors. Squint as such was not so accurately predictable. Of those children with squint 71 % had less than + 3. 50 dioptres of meridional <b>hypermetropia</b> at age 1 year [...] an incidence of 4. 4 % of the population. Apart from two 'congenital myopes' only 16 % of these had residual amblyopia after treatment, and their last known acuity was never less than 6 / 12. Astigmatism in infancy or later is not significantly associated with squint or amblyopia...|$|E
40|$|To {{find the}} optimal dosage of {{cyclopentolate}} 1 % for cycloplegic refraction in hypermetropes with brown irides, we investigated {{the difference in}} cycloplegic auto-refractions obtained after one, two, and three instillations in the same patient. The mean <b>hypermetropia</b> found after three instillations was statistically significantly more compared to that found after one instillation. There was {{no statistically significant difference}} in the mean <b>hypermetropia</b> between two and three instillations. There was no significant effect of gender, age, and the presence and type of horizontal deviation. These observations suggest that two drops of cyclopentolate 1 % 10 min apart are sufficient for cycloplegic refraction in hypermetropes...|$|E
