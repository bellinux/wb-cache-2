6000|$|Braile {{had been}} {{walking up and}} down again in his excitement, in his {{enjoyment}} of the psychological predicament, and again he stopped before Dylks.

6000|$|... "You <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> me. <b>You</b> pity me. You think I'll only be cannon-fodder <b>for</b> the Germans. <b>You</b> {{want to be}} nice, kind, {{sweet to}} me--to send me away with better thoughts.... Isn't that what you think?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, me. You don't {{understand}} these people, <b>you</b> couldn't <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> them {{any more than}} <b>you</b> could <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> me. <b>You</b> want them to run your mills <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> you don't {{want to know how}} they feel or how they live, and you just want me--for your pleasure." ...|$|R
6000|$|I said: [...] "Yes"--and I {{was in such}} a {{rage that}} I said it out loud. If Philip had handed me his cane, and had advised me to give the young hussies who were {{answerable}} for this dreadful state of things a good beating, I believe I should have done it. Papa turned his back on me and offered the girls a last chance: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> what <b>you</b> have done? Do you ask to be forgiven?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I came back," [...] Benham went on, [...] "to see to all this. Why else? I don't--now I see you--feel very fierce about it. But it has distressed me. You look changed, Amanda, and fagged.

Yes, I want to get out of it. That wasn't quite my idea, but now I see it is. It's queer, but on the whole I <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> All of us, poor humans--. There's reason to be sorry for all of us. We're full of lusts and uneasiness and resentments that we haven't the will to control. What do you two people want me to do to you? Would you like a divorce, Amanda? It's the clean, straight thing, isn't it? Or would the scandal hurt you?" ...|$|E

5000|$|... (translated) Congratulations. Must've {{been a lot}} of work {{playing this}} song backwards. Either {{you are one of the}} {{paranoid}} assholes we've created this song for, or you're simply curious. For the former, let me say: Anyone expecting satanic or fascist messages to be played backwards on our records must be downright silly and, what's more, probably has a persecution complex. You poor creature, we really <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>you!</b> Better lock yourself up and throw away the key.|$|E

That last morning he gave this letter to Sam to deliver to you, and the crazy old nigger kept it. However, {{it is too late}} to talk of that, only it does seem a great pity. I <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> both of <b>you.</b> Clarke never will forgive you, even if you want him to, which I am sure you do not. I don't know exactly what is in this letter, but I know it will make you ashamed to think you did not trust him." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the United Kingdom, {{columnist}} and television critic Charlie Brooker {{wrote of the}} show that [...] "when a TV show makes <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> potential child-rapists, <b>you</b> know it's doing something wrong". He also commented on the [...] "overpowering whiff of entrapment" [...] {{and the potential for}} viewer complicity. Brooker also mentioned the selection process for the actress as being disturbing by adding [...] "Presumably someone at To Catch a Predator HQ sat down with a bunch of audition tapes and spooled through it, trying to find a sexy 18-year-old who could pass for 13. They'll have stared at girl after girl, umming and ahhing over their chest sizes, until they found just the right one. And like I say, she's hot. But if you fancy her, you're a paedophile." ...|$|R
500|$|The revelation ruins their relationship. The actresses shared insight: [...] "Ruby {{just wants}} to get some {{security}} back, everything she thought her life was is totally up in the air"; whilst Charlie was [...] "trying desperately to bridge this gap" [...] The events impact Ruby's self-identity, leaving her feeling confused and her backstory succumb the distortion Charlie causes. Ruby starts to ask herself questions such as [...] "Where do I stand now with everything?" [...] and [...] "How do I reconcile this?".

Anderson felt there was a beautiful element to the storyline and opined [...] "Although it is tragic, <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> Charlie and <b>you</b> can sort of understand where it has all come from." [...] She said that ultimately everyone <b>feels</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> Ruby, meaning neither are wrong. Furthermore, she said [...] "You are just rooting <b>for</b> them, <b>you</b> just want them to get back to how they were and it {{is a bit of a}} journey." ...|$|R

5000|$|One day, Kancil {{is trying}} to steal {{cucumbers}} from a farmer's field. The first time, he steals some cucumbers successfully. But then, he encounters a scarecrow. He mocks the scarecrow because it cannot scare off Kancil. Kancil punches the scarecrow with his front leg, but his front leg gets stuck in the scarecrow. The scarecrow has been filled with glue by the farmer. Kancil forcefully tries to pull out his leg, but it is useless; the glue is too strong. Then later on, the farmer comes. He laughs at Kancil, who has finally been trapped by his plans. He puts Kancil in a cage {{for the rest of}} the day. Later at night, the farmer's dog comes to see Kancil. He mocks Kancil and says that Kancil will be cooked the next morning. Kancil stays calm and relaxed. The dog confused and asks Kancil why. Kancil says,"You were wrong, I'm not going to be cooked! I'm going to be a prince!" [...] The dog becomes more confused. [...] "I will marry the farmer's daughter and I will become a prince. I <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> all of your loyalties were paid just like this! You just become a dog! Look at me! Tomorrow I'll become a prince!" [...] says Kancil proudly. The dog, who feels discriminated against by his own master, asks Kancil to switch place. He thinks that by switching place with Kancil, he will become a prince instead. So he opens the cage and lets Kancil free. The next morning, the farmer is confused, because he does not see Kancil anywhere; instead, he sees his own dog in the cage, wagging his tail.|$|E
500|$|Another story arc saw Charlie {{reveal that}} her sister Ruby Buckton (Rebecca Breeds) {{is in fact}} her daughter. Charlie gave birth to Ruby after she was raped by Grant Bledcoe (Clayton Watson), when she was younger. Both Anderson and Breeds found the storyline {{challenging}} and felt {{they had to get}} it right. Breeds said it made her nervous but was pleased with the end result. She said she had to let it affect her own emotions to effect the viewing public. [...] "The revelation ruins their relationship, and Anderson said that Charlie was [...] "trying desperately to bridge this gap". Breeds added [...] "Ruby just wants to get some security back, everything she thought her life was is totally up in the air". Ruby becomes confused and starts to ask herself questions such as [...] "Where do I stand now?" [...] and [...] "How do I reconcile this?"

[...] Comparing the storyline to the lesbian plot she said, [...] "Perhaps this storyline was a little bit harder, you've seen the start of this storyline and there is a lot more to come and it wasn't easy." ...|$|R
40|$|Regardless {{of who you}} are or {{what you}} do, chances are {{you spend a lot of}} time racing the clock, {{worrying}} about getting everything done, and feeling out of control. A recent Gallup poll found that 40 percent of Americans feel stressed every day and another 39 percent are sometimes stressed. Most people don’t have a good handle on their stress. They focus on the unpleasant, and usually unexpected things that happen daily. That’s not just stress, it’s life. There is a major difference between stressors—those things that happen every day that have the potential for driving us crazy, or making us angry, frustrated, and hurt—and stress, the way we choose to respond to these stressors. You make a choice about how situations will affect the rest of your day. Why not make humor choices and practice them every day? Humor Makes Life Easier Humor can be a powerful and effective mechanism for coping with stress, especially when combined with other means of stress reduction. The real power of humor and laughter shows up when you learn to use it under stress. It keeps things in perspective, helps dispel negative emotions, and puts you in a frame of mind that can help you better cope with the situation. Combining stress management techniques with a humorous outlook on life won’t make you stress-proof, but it can make the bad things easier to endure. If you’re willing to laugh at the little disasters in life, you’ll find that other areas of your life will also become easier. Laughter, especially when you laugh at yourself, does many important things: • It empowers you. When you laugh at your setbacks, <b>you</b> no longer <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> yourself. <b>You</b> <b>feel</b> uplifted and encouraged. • It helps you communicate more effectively. • It makes you more likeable. • It helps you cope. “Nothing erases unpleasant thoughts more effectively than concentration on pleasant ones. ” (Hans Selye, stress researcher) • It provides perspective by removing you from your problems. Everyone makes mistakes, and we need to remember that, “I may not be totally perfect, but parts of me are excellent. ” (Ashleigh Brilliant) • People tend to be less threatened by you...|$|R
5000|$|In August 2009, Daniel and Susan Cohen {{decried the}} release of the bomber on grounds of {{compassion}}, saying [...] "I cannot imagine having compassion for a mass murderer and terrorist who killed 270 people." [...] Susan Cohen, in The Daily Telegraph adds, [...] "You want to <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> anyone, please <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> me, <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> my poor daughter, her body falling a mile through the air." [...] After the Gaddafi government lost control of Tripoli during the 2011 Libyan civil war, the Cohens expressed satisfaction.|$|R
5000|$|On August 27, 2015 The Wedding {{posted on}} their {{official}} Facebook page {{that they are}} confirming a hiatus the following message was posted. [...] "Hey y'all. Been a minute! It's time to reconnect and break the silence. It's no secret that we fell off the map without a trace a couple years ago. We've {{gotten a lot of}} questions about the status of the band, what happened, and what's next. The truth is, we haven't made a statement thus far because there hasn't been anything to state. We never intended for the last tour we did to have been our last tour. We wrapped it up, headed on home as usual, and settled in until the next one. But between then and now I guess [...] "life" [...] just happened. Members got married, members had babies, members got cool job opportunities and started businesses, members began the adoption process, members filled in for other bands, members moved to new cities; and before we knew it two years had gone by and we still hadn't booked that next tour. That brings us to today.No, we didn't break up. We just went on an unplanned indefinite hiatus (to put it in [...] "band" [...] terms). For those that followed the band since the beginning you know we were road dogs. 200+ shows a year for nearly a decade. We were almost never home. And we liked it that way. We've all learned to love being home, too. It's been more of a struggle to adjust for some than others but all in all this is a good season. Will we play shows again? Maybe. Will we make another record? Maybe. What are the chances? To be honest, I don't think any of us have any idea. Touring and records cost a lot of money, more than we have. But I do know this: we talk about it often. Yes, talk is cheap, but talk keeps it in the realm of possibility.I tell you this not to give you false hope if you are into our band, but to let you know that if you are reading this then we care about you and we care that you care if we make music again. Whether it happens or not, please know that while we were a full-time band, you guys handed us the time of our lives on a silver platter. Yeah, we roughed it hard in a van driving through the night and playing smokey bars and sleeping on floors for a decade yada yada yada, but we really had the time of our lives. And the ONLY reason we could stay on the road is because you cared about our music and spent your hard earned money on show tickets and merchandise and records. That will never be unappreciated. More importantly, you showed up and connected with us, and gave us the opportunity to have a real connection with you, as we all connected with the bigger picture. We were definitely a live band. If you never got to see it, I don't know whether you are lucky or I should <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> because it was always messy. A loud messy chaotic rock n roll hurricane, every night, whether for 100 people that were into it or 1,000 people that hated it, we went hard and loved every minute.We are all still close, even in different states, as this is much more than a band to us. This is a brotherhood. And brotherhoods don't just fade out. So to answer your question, once and for all, no matter what: The Wedding will never die. Rock n Roll Forever.- Cody, Matt, Adam, Trevor, Matt. Collectively: The Wedding" ...|$|E
