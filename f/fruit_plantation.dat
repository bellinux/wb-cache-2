5|$|Agriculture, {{which was}} once a major {{occupation}} {{of the people of}} Dakshina Kannada, has taken a backseat because of the influx of money from natives settled in other cities, states and countries. Significant number of people from this district work in the Gulf (Middle East) countries and other states of India. Farms and fields are being converted into residential plots and commercial (shopping) complexes. Horticulture, though, has made some strides, and measures have been taken to improve the <b>fruit</b> <b>plantation</b> sector. The main crops of Dakshina Kannada are Paddy, Coconut, Arecanut, Black Pepper, Cashew and Cocoa. Rubber, Banana and Vanilla crops are also cultivated in the Sullia taluk. Rice is generally cultivated three seasons in a year, Karthika or Yenel (May–October), Suggi (October to January) and Kolake (January to April). Urad (Black gram) is grown in some areas during the season of Suggi. The Karnataka Milk Federation has a milk processing plant at Kulshekar in Mangalore. This plant processes milk procured from the cattle owned by farmers of the district.|$|E

50|$|By 1859, {{there were}} two farms and 40 houses in Guldborg {{as well as an}} inn, a {{windmill}} and a pilot station. The early ferries were rowboats, replaced in 1867 by a cable ferry and in 1904 by a motor ferry with space for two horse-drawn carriages. The old ferry station was destroyed by a storm in 1862. Its replacement is now in an advanced state of deterioration. The ferry stopped operating in 1934 when Guldborg Bridge, also known as Christian X's Bridge, was opened. A harbour, built in the 1860s for shipping timber from the surrounding forests, was later also used for grain, pigs and cattle.

50|$|In 1988, she {{prepared}} the Glover's Reef Atoll Draft Management Plan and began efforts to secure reserve status for Glover's Reef as well. In 1990, she helped establish a Coastal Zone Management Unit {{as part of}} the Fisheries department. Gibson joined the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and in 1993, their efforts, along with other organizations' support gained a designation as a protected reserve for Belize. Gibson and others working in environmental protection began to realize that individual protection was insufficient as without a management approach that protected the entire barrier zone, external forces, like algae blooms spawned from <b>fruit</b> <b>plantation</b> waste, overfishing in other areas causing collateral damage, or sedimentation caused by development, were having detrimental impacts. Working with water management agencies, forestry representatives, other environmental groups and citizens, in 1993 a plan was adopted to formalize protection of the reef as a natural World Heritage Site in a serial nomination. After several years of planning and work, the designation was granted by UNESCO in November 1996. Gibson {{is the director of the}} Belize Wildlife Conservation Society and has published numerous scientific works.|$|E
5000|$|After the {{establishment}} of new transportation and communication methods in the country, the Italians also started to set up new factories, which in turn made due contribution in enhancing trade activities.

The Italian government continued to implement agricultural reforms but primarily on farms owned by Italian colonists (exports of coffee boomed in the 1930s). In the area of Asmara, there were in 1940 more than 2,000 small and medium-sized industrial companies, which were concentrated in the areas of construction, mechanics, textiles, food processing and electricity. Consequently, the standard of living in Eritrea in 1939 was considered among the best on the continent for both the local Eritreans and the Italian settlers.|$|E

50|$|Orange {{plantation}} {{started in}} Jampui hill {{during the early}} 60s. It began as a <b>fruit</b> <b>plantation</b> for self consumption. Later on, when markets opened the people realized the economic potential of oranges. New gardens were created {{and within a few}} years, almost all families started an orange plantation for commercial purpose in their lands. In course of time income from orange plantations drastically changed the economic conditions and standards of living of the people of Jampui. The quality of orange was so good that it won 1st position at fruits exhibition at New Delhi in the mid 80s. Since then, Jampui became famous as a place where best quality oranges are grown commercially. With this recognition, more tourist became interested in visiting the area. So, for promotion of tourism, the Information and Culture department of Tripura started the unique Orange & Tourism festival celebration every year at Jampui hill. A large number of tourists, both domestic and foreign, participate and enjoy this festival. However, due to spread of orange disease like milky dew, dieback, and attack by pests, about two-third of the orange plantations has been wiped out. At present, Orange festival has been discontinued due to decline in orange productions and for other reasons. During this festival season, September to December, the hill is covered with floating clouds and it provides a rare experience for the tourists. The formation of clouds {{at the bottom of the}} hill range and its gradual ascendance from the bottom to the top slowly engulfing the whole hill range in its mystic lap is an experience to treasure.|$|E
50|$|In {{the vacuum}} that {{followed}} the 1889 death of Emperor Yohannes IV, Gen. Oreste Baratieri occupied the highlands along the Eritrean coast and Italy proclaimed {{the establishment of the}} new colony of Italian Eritrea, a colony of the Kingdom of Italy. In the Treaty of Wuchale (It. Uccialli) signed the same year, King Menelik of Shewa, a southern Ethiopian kingdom, recognized the Italian occupation of his rivals' lands of Bogos, Hamasien, Akkele Guzay, and Serae in exchange for guarantees of financial assistance and continuing access to European arms and ammunition. His subsequent victory over his rival kings and enthronement as Emperor Menelek II (r. 1889-1913) made the treaty formally binding upon the entire territory.In 1888, the Italian administration launched its first development projects in the new colony. The Eritrean Railway was completed to Saati in 1888, and reached Asmara in the highlands in 1911. The Asmara-Massawa Cableway was the longest line in the world during its time, but was later dismantled by the British in World War II. Besides major infrastructural projects, the colonial authorities invested significantly in the agricultural sector. It also oversaw the provision of urban amenities in Asmara and Massawa, and employed many Eritreans in public service, particularly in the police and public works departments. Thousands of Eritreans were concurrently enlisted in the army, serving during the Italo-Turkish War in Libya as well as the First and Second Italo-Abyssinian Wars.Additionally, the Italian Eritrea administration opened a number of new factories, which produced buttons, cooking oil, pasta, construction materials, packing meat, tobacco, hide and other household commodities.

In two separate small plot replicated experiments (in 2010 and 2011, respectively) in plantations which had been cut down in the previous winter, galling damage and shoot growth were recorded in the vigorous regrowth in plots treated versus untreated with SP insecticides against 1 st, 2 nd or both D. tetensi generations.
