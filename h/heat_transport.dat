5|$|The tidal {{effect of}} the planets is weak and does not {{significantly}} affect {{the shape of the}} Sun. The Sun rotates faster at its equator than at its poles. This differential rotation is caused by convective motion due to <b>heat</b> <b>transport</b> and the Coriolis force due to the Sun's rotation. In a frame of reference defined by the stars, the rotational period is approximately 25.6 days at the equator and 33.5 days at the poles. Viewed from Earth as it orbits the Sun, the apparent rotational period of the Sun at its equator is about 28 days.|$|E

25|$|Analyses {{suggest that}} ocean current {{fluctuations}} can adequately account for recent glacial oscillations. During the last glacial period the sea-level has fluctuated 20–30nbsp&m as water was sequestered, {{primarily in the}} Northern Hemisphere ice sheets. When ice collected and the sea level dropped sufficiently, flow through the Bering Strait (the narrow strait between Siberia and Alaska is about 50nbsp&m deep today) was reduced, resulting in increased flow from the North Atlantic. This realigned the thermohaline circulation in the Atlantic, increasing <b>heat</b> <b>transport</b> into the Arctic, which melted the polar ice accumulation and reduced other continental ice sheets. The release of water raised sea levels again, restoring the ingress of colder water from the Pacific with an accompanying shift to northern hemisphere ice accumulation.|$|E
25|$|Geochemical modelers {{commonly}} create {{reaction path}} models {{to understand how}} systems respond to changes in composition, temperature, or pressure. By configuring {{the manner in which}} mass and heat transfer are specified (i.e., open or closed systems), models can be used to represent a variety of geochemical processes. Reaction paths can assume chemical equilibrium, or they can incorporate kinetic rate laws to calculate the timing of reactions. In order to predict the distribution in space and time of the chemical reactions that occur along a flowpath, geochemical models are increasingly being coupled with hydrologic models of mass and <b>heat</b> <b>transport</b> to form reactive transport models. Specialized geochemical modeling programs that are designed as cross-linkable re-entrant software objects enable construction of reactive transport models of any flow configuration.|$|E

40|$|Thermal {{gradients}} induce concentration gradients in alkali halide solutions, and {{the salt}} migrates towards hot or cold regions depending on the average temperature of the solution. This effect has been interpreted using the <b>heat</b> of <b>transport,</b> which provides a route to rationalize thermophoretic phenomena. Early theories provide estimates of the <b>heat</b> of <b>transport</b> at infinite dilution. These values are used to interpret thermodiffusion (Soret) and thermoelectric (Seebeck) effects. However, accessing <b>heats</b> of <b>transport</b> of individual ions at finite concentration remains an outstanding question both theoretically and experimentally. Here we discuss a computational approach to calculate <b>heats</b> of <b>transport</b> of aqueous solutions at finite concentrations, and apply our method to study lithium chloride solutions at concentrations $> 0. 5 $~M. The <b>heats</b> of <b>transport</b> are significantly different for Li$^+$ and Cl$^-$ ions, unlike what is expected at infinite dilution. We find theoretical evidence {{for the existence of}} minima in the Soret coefficient of LiCl, where the magnitude of the <b>heat</b> of <b>transport</b> is maximized. The Seebeck coefficient obtained from the ionic <b>heats</b> of <b>transport</b> varies significantly with temperature and concentration.

500|$|A {{simplified}} two-dimensional {{model for}} the spread of wildfires that used convection to represent the effects of wind and terrain, as well as radiative heat transfer as the dominant method of <b>heat</b> <b>transport</b> led to reaction-diffusion systems of partial differential equations. More complex models join numerical weather models or computational fluid dynamics models with a wildfire component which allow the feedback effects between the fire and the atmosphere to be estimated. [...] The additional complexity in the latter class of models translates to a corresponding increase in their computer power requirements. In fact, a full three-dimensional treatment of combustion via direct numerical simulation at scales relevant for atmospheric modeling is not currently practical because of the excessive computational cost such a simulation would require. [...] Numerical weather models have limited forecast skill at spatial resolutions under , forcing complex wildfire models to parameterize the fire in order to calculate how the winds will be modified locally by the wildfire, and to use those modified winds to determine {{the rate at which}} the fire will spread locally. [...] Although models such as Los Alamos' FIRETEC solve for the concentrations of fuel and oxygen, the computational grid cannot be fine enough to resolve the combustion reaction, so approximations must be made for the temperature distribution within each grid cell, as well as for the combustion reaction rates themselves.|$|E

2500|$|The basic {{mechanism}} can {{be qualified}} {{in a number}} of ways, none of which affect the fundamental process. The atmosphere near the surface is largely opaque to thermal radiation (with important exceptions for [...] "window" [...] bands), and most heat loss from the surface is by sensible heat and latent <b>heat</b> <b>transport.</b> Radiative energy losses become increasingly important higher in the atmosphere, largely because of the decreasing concentration of water vapor, an important greenhouse gas. It is more realistic to think of the greenhouse effect as applying to a [...] "surface" [...] in the mid-troposphere, which is effectively coupled to the surface by a lapse rate. The simple picture also assumes a steady state, but in the real world, there are variations due to the diurnal cycle as well as the seasonal cycle and weather disturbances. Solar heating only applies during daytime. During the night, the atmosphere cools somewhat, but not greatly, because its emissivity is low. Diurnal temperature changes decrease with height in the atmosphere.|$|E
2500|$|In 1990, {{a disgruntled}} {{employee}} at the Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station in Canada obtained a sample (estimated as about a [...] "half cup") of heavy {{water from the}} primary <b>heat</b> <b>transport</b> loop of the nuclear reactor, and loaded it into a cafeteria drink dispenser. Eight employees drank some of the contaminated water. The incident was discovered when employees began leaving bioassay urine samples with elevated tritium levels. The quantity of heavy water involved was far below levels that could induce heavy water toxicity, but several employees received elevated radiation doses from tritium and neutron-activated chemicals in the water. This was not an incident of heavy water poisoning, but rather radiation poisoning from other isotopes in the heavy water. Some news services were not careful to distinguish these points, {{and some of the}} public were left with the impression that heavy water is normally radioactive and more severely toxic than it is. Even if pure heavy water had been used in the water cooler indefinitely, it is not likely the incident would have been detected or caused harm, since no employee would be expected to get much more than 25% of their daily drinking water from such a source.|$|E

In all cases, thermotransport was toward colder regions and was significantly greater for deuterium than for hydrogen. A mas spectrometric technique {{was used to}} simultaneously measure <b>heats</b> of <b>transport</b> for hydrogen and deuterium in a single specimen containing both isotopes. This technique greatly increased the precision with which isotope effects in the <b>heat</b> of <b>transport</b> could be measured. The predominant effect of alloying was to dramatically increase thermotransport; however, thermotransport decreased as niobium was added to tantalum. The <b>heat</b> of <b>transport</b> did not vary linearly with alloy composition, but rather, the changes were always greater at low concentrations of the substitutional element. Close correlations between the <b>heat</b> of <b>transport</b> and the activation energy for diffusion of hydrogen indicate that the temperature dependence of atomic jump frequencies is the predominant factor controlling thermotransport with some gradient-related bias {{in the direction of}} atomic jumps possibly caused by an electronic mechanism.
