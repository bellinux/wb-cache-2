It therefore uses stimulation parameters that do not require effortful task completion.

Yet another important feature that distinguishes clinical applications from typical SVM applications in BMIs is the need for rapid ERP detection, without any <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> training <b>period</b> for the classifier.
