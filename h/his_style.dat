5|$|In 1874 Janáček {{became friends}} with Antonín Dvořák, and began {{composing}} in a relatively traditional romantic style. After his opera Šárka (1887–1888), <b>his</b> <b>style</b> absorbed elements of Moravian and Slovak folk music.|$|E

5|$|A titled Igbo {{chieftain}} himself, Achebe's novels {{focus on}} the traditions of Igbo society, the effect of Christian influences, and the clash of Western and traditional African values {{during and after the}} colonial era. <b>His</b> <b>style</b> relies heavily on the Igbo oral tradition, and combines straightforward narration with representations of folk stories, proverbs, and oratory. He also published a number of short stories, children's books, and essay collections.|$|E
5|$|Although {{influenced}} by Matisse, the Oriental art that Jolin discovered at Musée Guimet {{was even more}} important to <b>his</b> <b>style.</b> Chinese and Japanese art became the base for the decorative, slightly naïve style in light colours, that he developed during the 1910s and 1920s. Jolin's style deviates {{from that of the}} traditional Expressionists, in that he simplifies his motifs in an almost primitive way, painting an imagined reality rather than raw emotions.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the paucity}} of {{surviving}} attributed works, {{it is difficult to}} detect any evolution in Lochner's style. Art historians are unsure if <b>his</b> <b>style</b> became progressively more or less influenced by Netherlandish art. Recent dendrochronological examination of attributed works indicate that his development was not linear, suggesting that the more advanced Presentation in the Temple is of 1445, predating the more Gothic Saints panels now divided between London and Cologne.|$|E

5|$|Chabas studied under {{artists such}} as Tony Robert-Fleury, William-Adolphe Bouguereau, and Albert Maignan. Although his earlier works were {{generally}} portraits, most of the painter's later production consisted of nude girls and young women. The lakes and rivers of France were common settings for his paintings, which gave prominence to the interaction of light with the models and their surroundings. September Morn is typical of <b>his</b> <b>style.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the 1989 season, 11–year veteran Ottis Anderson, a Plan B Free Agent, {{emerged as}} the Giants new {{featured}} running back. <b>His</b> <b>style</b> of power running was an ideal fit for Parcells' offensive strategy and he ran for 1,023yards and caught 28 passes. Dave Meggett also emerged as a threat on third downs and special teams, catching 34 passes for 531yards and making the Pro Bowl.|$|E
5|$|García {{has worn}} the number 7 jersey for both club and country {{during the course}} of her short career.

5|$|Hanneman was {{introduced}} to heavy metal music as a child through his older sister Mary, when she was listening to Black Sabbath at her house. Once he reached high school, he discovered hardcore punk, which had a significant influence on <b>his</b> <b>style</b> and attitude.|$|E
5|$|Hunt drew {{criticism}} for <b>his</b> <b>style</b> of returning the football; upon receiving the ball, {{he would run}} straight at opposition players rather than attempting to evade them. As a result, he received several high tackles, causing the Broncos to ask the NRL to protect Hunt by punishing opposition players more severely. The referees' board supported this position, and stated that fullbacks such as Hunt needed to be protected due to greater risk of injury.|$|E
5|$|Ibn Ali was {{strongly}} influenced by Elmo Hope, and his playing was rapid and intense, retaining a sense of rhythm even when <b>his</b> <b>style</b> became increasingly unconventional. Several recordings of his playing may exist, but only one – The Max Roach Trio Featuring the Legendary Hasaan – has been released. Ibn Ali built a reputation in Philadelphia, where he influenced musicians including John Coltrane, but he remained little known elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|H.H. Rajah Vyner of Sarawak, GCMG (1932 – 9 May 1963) Although {{his rule}} in Sarawak ceased in 1946, {{part of the}} abdication {{settlement}} was that he maintained <b>his</b> <b>styles</b> and titles for life.|$|R
5|$|In 1922, Hunter {{began to}} make a series of trips to {{mainland}} Europe, where he visited Paris, Venice, Florence and the Riviera. Fergusson accompanied him {{on a number of}} these visits. Hunter's visits abroad produced a large number of paintings and <b>his</b> <b>style</b> changed noticeably in this period of European travel as he began using dabs of colour placed instinctively to portray underlying form.|$|E
5|$|In 1923 Trotter {{eventually}} {{came to an}} uneasy truce with the NAACP. His attempts to promote <b>his</b> <b>style</b> of activism, however, were eclipsed by activities of younger leaders, such as Marcus Garvey, a Jamaican immigrant in New York City {{and leader of the}} UNIA.|$|E
5|$|In {{the view}} of his biographer Hugh Macdonald, Massenet's main {{influences}} were Gounod and Thomas, with Meyerbeer and Berlioz also important to <b>his</b> <b>style.</b> From beyond France he absorbed some traits from Verdi, and possibly Mascagni, and above all Wagner. Unlike some other French composers of the period, Massenet never fell fully under Wagner's spell, but he took from the earlier composer a richness of orchestration and a fluency in treatment of musical themes.|$|E
50|$|Lewis {{describes}} <b>his</b> current <b>style</b> as {{influenced by}} classic rock, soul, funk, and blues. Musicians who influenced <b>his</b> musical <b>style</b> include Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page, John Bonham, Jack Bruce, Stevie Wonder, and Billy Preston.|$|R

He earns between £250,000 and £299,999 as a BBC journalist.|$|E
5|$|Like the nocturnes, the barcarolles span {{nearly the}} whole of Fauré's {{composing}} career, and they similarly display the evolution of <b>his</b> <b>style</b> from the uncomplicated charm of the early pieces to the withdrawn and enigmatic quality of the late works. All are written with compound time signatures (6/8 or 9/8), except number 7, which is in 6/4.|$|E
5|$|Moon further {{strengthened}} {{the reversal of}} traditional rock instrumentation by playing lead parts on his drums. <b>His</b> <b>style</b> was at odds with British rock contemporaries such as The Kinks' Mick Avory and The Shadows' Brian Bennett who did not consider tom-toms necessary for rock music. Moon used Premier kits starting in 1966. He avoided the hi-hat, and concentrated on a mix of tom rolls and cymbals.|$|E
50|$|Jamil Naqsh {{has also}} painted Islamic {{calligraphy}} in <b>his</b> modern <b>style</b> with unique and bold brush strokes. <b>His</b> particular <b>style</b> of calligraphy is designed {{keeping in mind}} {{the basic elements of}} art, particularly emphasising on 'line'.|$|R
