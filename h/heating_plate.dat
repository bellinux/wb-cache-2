50|$|For {{several years}} now, at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), a {{pressure}} or high pressure (thermo)forming process {{is used to}} fabricate film microchips for capillary electrophoresis (CE) 3-5 and for three-dimensional cell cultivation 6-8.

This is a simple variation of vacuum or pressure forming without prestretching, i.e. a single stage forming, into a female mould with heating of the plastic sheet using a contact <b>heating</b> <b>plate</b> inside the forming station. The forming air is supplied via through holes in the <b>heating</b> <b>plate.</b> Still in a laboratory scale process, diverse thermoplastic films also from biodegradable polymers such as polycaprolactone (PCL) with thicknesses typically between 20 and 100 µm are thermoformed.

50|$|Butt welding {{is usually}} {{performed}} {{using one of}} several methods. The first, and most common, is butt welding or butt fusion, which {{is a type of}} hot plate welding. This technique involves heating two planed surfaces of thermoplastic material (typically polyethylene) against a heated surface. After a specified amount of time, the <b>heating</b> <b>plate</b> is removed and the two pieces are pressed together and allowed to cool under pressure, forming the desired bond. Butt welding outside of manufacturing is usually performed to join pipes.|$|E

In this picture, a high-intensity pulsed laser shoots a rotating white disk of Al2O3 (alumina). The laser pulse creates a plasma explosion, visible as the purple cloud. The plasma cloud from the alumina expands towards the square substrate, made of SrTiO3, where it condenses and solidifies, building up one atomic layer at a time.

50|$|A third {{method of}} {{thermoplastic}} welding is called sidewall fusion, or saddle fusion. Sidewall fusion is, like butt fusion and socket fusion, another process based on hot plate welding. Sidewall fusion differs from either socket, or butt fusion methods by performing fusion {{into the side}} of the pipe wall in a transverse orientation to the main pipe, rather than in line with the pipe. Sidewall fusion is typically employed in conjunction with either socket or butt fusion methods as a complementary process and many fusion machines designed for butt fusion are also equipped for sidewall fusion. Adaptor plates that match the outside diameter of the main pipe are applied to the <b>heating</b> <b>plate</b> to perform this type of fusion.|$|E

When the heating load was low (form 6 to 8 kgm- 2), the degree of fi neness of raw material had no infl uence on the specifi c energy requirements needed to <b>heat</b> of <b>plates</b> and to dry the raw material. How-ever, the increase of heating load from 10 to 14 kgm- 2 resulted in the increase of specifi c energy inputs with the increasing degrees of fi neness.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 5 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, South Africa, 1 - 4 July, 2007. The natural convective heat transfer rate from a relatively narrow <b>heated</b> vertical <b>plate</b> with a uniform heat flux over its surface has been numerically studied. This <b>heated</b> <b>plate</b> is embedded in a large plane adiabatic surface, {{the surface of the}} <b>heated</b> <b>plate</b> being somewhat “below” that of the adiabatic surface, i. e., the <b>heated</b> <b>plate</b> surface is recessed in the adiabatic surface. The main aim of the present work was to study how the recessing of the <b>heated</b> <b>plate</b> into the surface affects the mean heat transfer rate from the plate. It has been assumed that the flow is steady and laminar and that the fluid properties are constant except for the density change with temperature which gives rise to the buoyancy forces, this having been treated by using the Boussinesq approach. It has also been assumed that the flow is symmetrical about the vertical centre-plane of the plate. The solution has been obtained by numerically solving the full three-dimensional form of the governing equations, these equations being written in dimensionless form. The solution was obtained using a commercial finite element method based code, FIDAP. The solution has the Rayleigh number based on the plate height and the surface heat flux, the dimensionless plate width, the dimensionless depth that the <b>heated</b> <b>plate</b> is recessed into the adiabatic surface, and the Prandtl number as parameters. Results have only been obtained for Pr = 0. 7.

50|$|Scorching {{is similar}} to glazing except {{that it is not}} used to polish the stock. Instead, {{scorching}} does what it implies: as the temperature of the die <b>heating</b> <b>plate</b> is increased beyond a normal temperature range, a scorched effect is created in the embossed image, which results in an antique or shaded appearance. It is best to use a lighter colored stock for this procedure in order to provide a unique two-toned appearance. Caution should be used in requesting this effect, since it is easy to burn the stock if too much heat is used. If scorching occurs too close to the printed copy, it can interfere with the clarity of the printed copy; however, this may be the effect that is desired for a particular application.|$|E
5000|$|Recently, the Mr. Coffee product {{development}} team altered how their drip coffee maker {{works with a}} method dubbed “Optimal Brew”. The coffee maker does not use the previously mentioned traditional method of routing the water over a heating coil under the warming plate invented by Marotta, Abel, and Schulze. Instead, a small flash boiling chamber flash heats the water to deliver the water to the beans within a temperature range of 195-200 degrees F. [...] Heating the water this way allows 10 cups to be brewed in generally less than eight minutes depending on the barometric pressure. [...] Once brewed the coffee stays warm in a thermal carafe without requiring a <b>heating</b> <b>plate</b> which could potentially burn the coffee. This coffee maker engineered and designed by TEAMS Design USA and the Jarden team, won a Red Star Award [...] in 2010 and an Appliance Magazine EID Award [...] in 2011.|$|E
