5|$|Recovery {{began with}} the mid-1948 {{currency}} reform in Western Germany, and was sped up by the liberalisation of European economic policy that the Marshall Plan (1948–1951) both directly and indirectly caused. The post-1948 West German recovery {{has been called the}} German economic miracle. Italy also experienced an economic boom and the French economy rebounded. By contrast, the United Kingdom {{was in a state of}} economic ruin, and although it received a quarter of the total Marshall Plan assistance, more than any other <b>European</b> <b>country,</b> continued relative economic decline for decades.|$|E
5|$|The Brazilian {{system was}} {{relatively}} democratic {{for a period}} during which indirect elections were common in democracies. The income requirement was much higher in the United Kingdom, even after the reforms of 1832. At the time the only nations not requiring a minimum level of income as a qualification for voting were France and Switzerland where universal suffrage was introduced only in 1848. It is probable that no <b>European</b> <b>country</b> at the time had such liberal legislation as Brazil. The income requirement was low enough that any employed male citizen could qualify to vote. As an illustration, the lowest paid civil employee in 1876 was a janitor who earned Rs600$000 annually.|$|E

The farm also made use of tenant farming, established working blacksmith, wheelwright, and harness shops on-site, was located around Walter Law's manor house, and constructed numerous buildings in the Tudor Revival architectural style.|$|E

5|$|The {{legal status}} of {{psilocybin}} mushrooms varies worldwide. Psilocybin and psilocin are listed as Class A (United Kingdom) or Schedule I (US) drugs under the United Nations 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. The possession and use of psilocybin mushrooms, including P.semilanceata, is therefore prohibited by extension. Although many European countries remained open to the use and possession of hallucinogenic mushrooms after the US ban, starting in the 2000s (decade) {{there has been a}} tightening of laws and enforcements. In The Netherlands, where the drug was once routinely sold in licensed cannabis coffee shops and smart shops, laws were instituted in October 2008 to prohibit the possession or sale of psychedelic mushrooms—the final <b>European</b> <b>country</b> to do so.|$|E

5|$|After Italy, Hungary was {{the first}} <b>European</b> <b>country</b> where the renaissance appeared. The Renaissance style came {{directly}} from Italy during the Quattrocento to Hungary first in the Central European region, thanks {{to the development of}} early Hungarian-Italian relationships – not only in dynastic connections, but also in cultural, humanistic and commercial relations – growing in strength from the 14th century. The relationship between Hungarian and Italian Gothic styles was a second reason – exaggerated breakthrough of walls is avoided, preferring clean and light structures. Large-scale building schemes provided ample and long term work for the artists, for example, the building of the Friss (New) Castle in Buda, the castles of Visegrád, Tata and Várpalota. In Sigismund's court there were patrons such as Pipo Spano, a descendant of the Scolari family of Florence, who invited Manetto Ammanatini and Masolino da Pannicale to Hungary.|$|E
5|$|In 2000 Belarus and Russia {{signed a}} treaty for greater cooperation, with some hints of forming a Union State. Over 70% of Belarus's {{population}} of 9.49million resides in urban areas. More than 80% {{of the population}} is ethnic Belarusian, with sizable minorities of Russians, Poles and Ukrainians. Since a referendum in 1995, the country has had two official languages: Belarusian and Russian. The Constitution of Belarus does not declare any official religion, although the primary religion in the country is Eastern Orthodox Christianity. The second-most widespread religion, Roman Catholicism, has a much smaller following; nevertheless, Belarus celebrates both Orthodox and Catholic versions of Christmas and Easter as national holidays. Belarus is the only <b>European</b> <b>country</b> to retain capital punishment in both law and practice. Belarus {{is a member of the}} United Nations since its founding, the Commonwealth of Independent States, CSTO, EEU, and the Non-Aligned Movement. Belarus has shown no aspirations for joining the European Union but nevertheless maintains a bilateral relationship with the organisation, and likewise participates in two EU projects: the Central European Initiative and the Baku Initiative.|$|E
5|$|In July 1780 Adams {{replaced}} Laurens as {{the ambassador}} to the Dutch Republic, {{then one of the}} few other republics in the world. With the aid of the Dutch Patriot leader Joan van der Capellen tot den Pol, Adams secured the recognition of the United States as an independent government at The Hague on April 19, 1782. In February 1782 the Frisian states was the first Dutch province to recognize the United States, while France had been the first <b>European</b> <b>country</b> to grant diplomatic recognition in 1778. He also negotiated a loan of five million guilders financed by Nicolaas van Staphorst and Wilhelm Willink. By 1794 a total of eleven loans were granted in Amsterdam to the United States with a value of 29 million guilders. In October 1782, he negotiated with the Dutch a treaty of amity and commerce, the first such treaty between the United States and a foreign power following the 1778 treaty with France. The house that Adams bought during this stay in The Netherlands became the first American-owned embassy on foreign soil.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} actual and {{potential}} trade arrangements between the European Union and Central and Eastern <b>European</b> <b>countries.</b> <b>European</b> Agreements have facilitated the reorientation of external trade of the Central <b>European</b> <b>countries.</b> This reorientation has already occurred with remarkable success. Central <b>European</b> <b>countries</b> are already selling over 60 % {{of their total}} exports to the European Union. Taking as a benchmark a gravity model, actual export shares to the EU are generally larger than what the gravity model would suggest, contradicting the view that European Agreements were too protectionist for the export re-orientation of Central <b>European</b> <b>countries.</b> For those Eastern countries not covered by European Agreements, establishment of a European Free Trade Zone is proposed. ...|$|R
