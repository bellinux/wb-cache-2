40|$|AbstractPhotosystem I (PSI) in barley {{consists}} {{of at least}} 11 polypeptides of which three have apparent sizes of 15 – 19 kDa. Two of these polypeptides (subunits III and IV) are constituents of the core complex (CCI), the third is {{a component of the}} light-harvesting complex (LHCI). After fractionation of PSI into its CCI and LHCI components, each of the polypeptides has been isolated and its N-terminal region sequenced. We conclude that the gene sequence published for subunit IV of spinach [(1988) FEBS Lett. 237, 108 - 112] is not that of subunit IV but rather that of the 17 kDA LHCIc pigment protein. We confirm that the published sequence for subunit III [(1988) Curr. Genet. 14, 511 - 518] is indeed that of subunit III; seemingly conflicting identifications, based on apparent sizes on SDS-PAGE, of which polypeptides are subunits III and IV are probably explained by subunit III's <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>migration</b> <b>rate</b> being dependent on the solvent.

40|$|Human {{epithelioid}} T- 1 E {{cells were}} cultured in suspension {{and subjected to}} density gradient electrophoresis upward in a vertical column. It is indicated that the most rapidly migrating cells were {{at the beginning of the}} cell cycle and the most slowly migrating cells were at the end of the cell cycle. The fastest migrating cells divided 24 hr later than the slowest migrating cells. Colonies developing from slowly migrating cells had twice as many cells during exponential growth as did the most rapidly migrating cells, and the numbers of cells per colony at any time was inversely related to the <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>migration</b> <b>rate.</b> The DNA measurements by fluorescence flow cytometry indicates that the slowest migrating cell populations are enriched in cells that have twice as much DNA as the fastest migrating cells. It is concluded that electrophoretic mobility of these cultured human cells declines steadily through the cell cycle and that the mobility is lowest at the end of G sub 2 phase and highest at the beginning of G sub 1 phase...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies of}} {{premature}} chain termination mutants and in frame deletion mutants of the p 21 ras transforming protein encoded by the transforming gene of Harvey murine sarcoma virus (Ha-MuSV) {{have suggested that}} the C terminus is required for cellular transformation, lipid binding, and membrane localization. We have now further characterized the post-translational processing of these mutants and have also studied two C-terminal v-rasH point mutants: one encodes serine in place of cysteine- 186, the other threonine for valine- 187. The Thr- 187 mutant was transformation-competent, and its p 21 protein was processed normally, as was the p 21 encoded by a transformation-competent deletion mutant from which amino acids 166 - 175 had been deleted. The Ser- 186 mutant was defective for transformation. The p 21 s encoded by the Ser- 186 mutant and by the previously described transformation-defective mutants did not undergo the posttranslational processing common to biologically active ras proteins: their <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>migration</b> <b>rate</b> did not change, they remained in the cytosol, and they failed to bind lipid. Since the cell-encoded ras proteins also contain this cysteine, we conclude that this amino acid residue is required for all ras proteins...|$|E
40|$|Two {{distinct}} {{groups of}} influenza A/H 3 N 2 viruses, {{closely related to}} A/Bangkok/I/ 79 and to A/Belgium/ 2 / 81, have been chosen from viruses isolated in Italy during 1981 to 1983 {{with the aim of}} analysing the biochemical composition of their polypeptides. The strains of each group have shown differences in <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>migration</b> <b>rates</b> in one or more proteins in comparison to the prototype viruses. Polypeptide mobility variations among isolates from circumscribed geographical areas and from single outbreaks have also been observed. In particular, there was a high degree of variability in the NS 1 protein. The detection of biochemical differences among identical antigenic variants, probably the result of point mutations in polypeptide sequences or of genetic reassortment among different co-circulating human viruses, is a further expression of the peculiar ability of the influenza A virus to exhibit variation in internal proteins during its circulation. It is well known that a variety of influenza strains, differing not only in the antigenic specificity of the haemagglutinin, but also {{in a number of other}} genes coding for the internal proteins, can circulate simultaneously in widespread epidemics...|$|R
40|$|Several physical, chemical, and {{serological}} {{properties of}} surface antigen particles from ground squirrel hepatitis virus (GSHsAg) and human hepatitis B virus (HBsAg) were compared. GSHsAg and HBsAg particles were purified from positive sera by gel chromatography and isopycnic centrifugation. Both antigens consisted mainly of spherical particles {{with an average}} diameter of approximately 20 nm and a buoyant density in CsCl of approximately 1. 19 g/ml. Their UV absorption spectra indicated the presence of more tryptophane than tyrosine {{and the absence of}} detectable nucleic acid. GSHsAg was found to contain two major polypeptides of approximately 23, 000 and 27, 000 daltons, with <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>migration</b> <b>rates</b> distinctly faster than those of the two major polypeptides of HBsAg particles. After radiolabeling of purified antigen preparations with Bolton-Hunter reagent, the two major polypeptides of GSHsAg showed almost identical tryptic peptide maps. The tryptic peptide map of the major polypeptide from GSHsAg contained 13 of 37 spots also present in the map of the major HBsAg polypeptide, and 13 of 27 spots in the map of the major HBsAg polypeptide were also present in the map of the major GSHsAg polypeptide. This suggests considerable sequence homology between the major surface antigen polypeptides of the two viruses. However, there was only a weak serological cross-reactivity between antigens of the two viruses. Using an anti-HBs-containing serum with a relatively strong cross-reactivity, GSHsAg was found to consist of at least two antigenically different subspecies. The more strongly cross-reacting from had a slightly higher buoyant density than the other antigenic form...|$|R

In the first system the tool. wt. of the observed components were estimated {{and in the second}} system proteins with similar mol. wt. were resolved by their different charges. The proteins were either denatured by urea, reduced by mercaptoethanol, or oxidized by performic acid. They were dissociated completely only by reduction or oxidation. By denaturation with 8 M-urea, dimers with rnol. wt. of about 58 ooo were observed. In propionic acid-urea electrophoresis, each of the three virus types A 2 Spain, Ol Kaufbeuren and C Upper Bavaria showed three main proteins (VP I, VP 2, VP 3) and a fourth fast-migrating protein, VP 4. The <b>rates</b> of <b>migration</b> of VP I and VP 3 were approx, the same in all types, whereas VP 2 showed differences between types. The component VP 4 was not present in the empty capsids or in the I 2 S subunits. On elution of the proteins from the gets used in propionic acid-urea electrophoresis followed by re-electrophoresis in both systems, {{it was found that the}} relative <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>migration</b> <b>rates</b> of VP I and VP 3 were opposed in the two systems. The oxidized proteins VP I, VP 2, and VP 3 had similar mol. wt. of about 26 ooo to 28 ooo but varied in charge.

40|$|Porcine enteropathogenic Escherichia coli strains {{possessing}} or lacking K 88 antigen {{were studied}} by using hydrophobic interaction chromatography on cross-linked agarose gels with alkyl or aryl substituents (amphiphilic gels) {{to determine whether}} or not they possessed surface-associated hydrophobic properties. Strains with K 88 ab or K 88 ac antigen adsorbed to phenyl and octyl Sepharose gels in the presence of 4 M sodium chloride. This property correlated with phenotypic expression of K 88 antigen. Cells grown at 37 degrees C but not those grown at 18 degrees C possessed hydrophobic adsorptive characteristics in addition to the property of mannose-resistant hemagglutination of guinea pig erythrocytes. Adsorption of K 88 -positive strains to gels with hydrophobic ligands was independent of O group and enterotoxicity. Strains lacking K 88 antigen did not adsorb to the hydrophobically substituted derivatives of Sepharose and lacked mannose-resistant hemagglutinating characteristics. Neither the presence of additional polysaccharide K antigens nor nonhemagglutinating pili conferred the property of hydrophobic interaction on the strains. K 88 -positive bacteria had a lower <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>migration</b> <b>rate</b> than did K 88 -negative bacteria of the same serotype in free-zone electrophoresis. K 88 -positive bacteria also adsorbed strongly to hydrophobic ligands in the presence of 1 M ammonium sulfate, whereas K 88 -negative strains did not. These observations provide evidence for the suspected role of hydrophobic interaction in the adhesive properties of certain enteropathogenic strains of E. coli. Moreover, hydrophobic interaction chromatography provides convenient and rapid alternative means of screening strains for a property potentially associated with adhesiveness...|$|E
40|$|Masticatory myosin {{heavy chain}} (M MyHC) is a myosin subunit isoform with {{expression}} restricted to muscles {{derived from the}} first branchial arch, such as jaw-closer muscles, with pronounced interspecies variability. Only sparse information {{is available on the}} contractile properties of muscle fibers expressing M MyHC (M fibers). In this study, we characterized M fibers isolated from the jaw-closer muscles (temporalis and masseter) of two species of domestic carnivores, the cat and the dog, compared with fibers expressing slow or fast (2 A, 2 X, and 2 B) isoforms. In each fiber, during maximally calcium-activated contractions at 12 degrees C, we determined isometric-specific tension (P(o)), unloaded shortening velocity (v(o)) with the slack test protocol, and the rate constant of tension redevelopment (K(TR)) after a fast shortening-relengthening cycle. At the end of the mechanical experiment, we identified MyHC isoform composition of each fiber with gel electrophoresis. <b>Electrophoretic</b> <b>migration</b> <b>rate</b> of M MyHC was similar in both species. We found that in both species the kinetic parameters v(o) and K(TR) of M fibers were similar to those of 2 A fibers, whereas P(o) values were significantly greater than in any other fiber types. The similarity between 2 A and M fibers and the greater tension development of M fibers were confirmed also in mechanical experiments performed at 24 degrees C. Myosin concentration was determined in single fibers and found not different in M fibers compared with slow and fast fibers, suggesting that the higher tension developed by M fibers does not find an explanation in a greater number of force generators. The specific mechanical characteristics of M fibers might be attributed to a diversity in cross-bridge kinetics...|$|E
40|$|In the {{mammalian}} genome, among myosin {{heavy chain}} (MyHC) isoforms a family {{can be identified}} as sarcomeric based on their molecular structure which allows thick filament formation. In this study we aimed to assess {{the expression of the}} 10 sarcomeric isoforms in human skeletal muscles, adopting this species as a reference for comparison with all other mammalian species. To this aim, we set up the condition for quantitative Real Time PCR assay to detect and quantify MyHC mRNA expression {{in a wide variety of}} human muscles from somitic, presomitic and preotic origin. Specific patterns of expression of the following genes MYH 1, MYH 2, MYH 3, MYH 4, MYH 6, MYH 7, MYH 8, MYH 13, MYH 14 / 7 b and MYH 15 were demonstrated in various muscle samples. On the same muscle samples which were analysed for mRNA expression, the corresponding MyHC proteins were studied with SDS PAGE and Western blot. The mRNA-protein comparison allowed the identification of 10 distinct proteins based on the <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>migration</b> <b>rate.</b> Three groups were formed based on the migration rate: fast migrating comprising beta/slow/ 1, alpha cardiac and fast 2 B, slow migrating comprising fast 2 X, fast 2 A and two developmental isoforms (NEO and EMB), intermediate migrating comprising EO MyHC, slow B (product of MYH 15), slow tonic (product of MYH 14 / 7 b). Of special interest was the demonstration of a protein band corresponding to 2 B-MyHC in laryngeal muscles and the finding that all 10 isoforms are expressed in extraocular muscles. These latter muscles are the unique localization for extraocular, slow B (product of MYH 15) and slow tonic (product of MYH 14 / 7 b) ...|$|E
40|$|Transport of sugars {{across the}} cytoplasmic {{membranes}} of gram-positive bacteria {{appears to be}} regulated {{by the action of}} a metabolite-activated, ATP-dependent protein kinase that phosphorylates a seryl residue in the phosphocarrier protein of the phosphotransferase system, HPr. We have developed a quantitative assay for measuring the activity of this enzyme from Streptococcus pyogenes. The product of the in vitro protein kinase-catalyzed reaction was shown to be phosphoseryl-HPr by several independent criteria (rates of hydrolysis in the presence of various agents, detection of serine-phosphate in acid hydrolysates, immunological assay, and <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>migration</b> <b>rates).</b> HPrs isolated from four different gram-positive bacteria (S. pyogenes, Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus subtilis) were shown to be phosphorylated by the kinase from S. pyogenes. In contrast, Escherichia coli HPr was not a substrate of this enzyme. The soluble kinase released from the particulate fraction of the cells with high salt {{in the presence of a}} protease inhibitor was shown to have an approximate molecular weight of 60, 000 as estimated by gel filtration. Its activity was dependent on divalent cations, with Mg 2 + and Mn 2 + being most active. EDTA, Pi, and high concentrations of salt were strongly inhibitory. The enzyme was optimally active at pH 7. 0, exhibited high affinity for its substrates, and was dependent on the presence of one of several metabolites. Of these compounds, fructose 1 - 6 -diphosphate was most active, with gluconate 6 -phosphate, 2 -phosphoglycerate, 2, 3 -diphosphoglycerate, phosphoenolpyruvate, and pyruvate exhibiting moderate to low stimulatory activities. Other compounds tested, including a variety of sugar phosphates, pyridine nucleotides, and other metabolites were without effect. The ATP-dependent phosphorylation of HPr on the seryl residue was strongly inhibited by phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation of the active histidyl residue of this protein. Treatment of the kinase with diethyl pyrocarbonate strongly inhibited the ATP-dependent phosphorylation activity, although the sulfhydryl reagents N-ethylmaleimide, p-chloromercuribenzoate, and iodoacetate were without effect. These results serve to characterize the HPr (serine) kinase, which apparently regulates the rates of carbohydrate transport in streptococcal cells via the phosphotransferase system. A primary role of this kinase in the control of cellular inducer levels and carbohydrate metabolic rates is proposed...|$|R
40|$|Three bovine {{rotavirus}} strains {{belonging to}} two distinct serotype groups, serotype 6 (NCDV and B 641) and B 223, {{distinct from the}} other six mammalian rotavirus serotypes but not yet assigned to a serotype group, were compared {{with each other and}} with canine rotavirus (K 9, serotype 3) by studying the properties of their cognate polypeptide species VP 4, VP 6, and VP 7. The three viruses showed distinct differences in the polyacrylamide gel <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>migration</b> <b>rates</b> of protein species VP 4 and VP 7, with minor differences in VP 6. Differences were also observed among the migration patterns of genome segments 4, 6, and the 7 - 8 - 9 triplet, which encode VP 4, VP 6, and VP 7, respectively. Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to B 223, which were directed against VP 4 or VP 7, showed homologous specificity for neutralization and immunofluorescence (IF), although one MAb reactive with VP 4 also reacted by IF and by immunoprecipitation (IP) with all four viruses and weakly neutralized B 641 and K 9. This MAb may react with the epitope responsible for the B 223 -induced one-way neutralizing and protection response of calves against B 641 observed in earlier studies. MAbs reactive with VP 6 by IP showed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and IF reactivity with all three bovine viruses and the canine virus. The two serotype 6 viruses could be distinguished by the two B 641 MAbs, B 641 -N 2 b reacting by neutralization and IF with both viruses and B 641 -N 1 reacting with B 641 and the serotype 3 canine rotavirus but not with NCDV. One nonneutralizing B 641 MAb reacted by IP and IF with VP 7 of all four rotaviruses examined, and one B 223 MAb neutralized B 223 and, to low titer, B 641 and K 9 although reacting by IP and IF with all four viruses. Three MAb-resistant mutants were selected by passage of B 223 in the presence of one of three selected B 223 MAbs at concentrations which only neutralized approximately 90 % of the infectious virions. The resulting mutants were 100 % resistant to neutralization with their respective MAb but remained neutralizable by the same selection of MAbs as the parent B 223 virus...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{concept of}} ideal {{geometric}} configurations was recently {{applied to the}} classification and characterization of various knots. Different knots in their ideal form (i. e., the one requiring the shortest length of a constant-diameter tube to form a given knot) were shown to have an overall compactness proportional to the time-averaged compactness of thermally agitated knotted polymers forming corresponding knots. This was useful for predicting the relative speed of <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>migration</b> of different DNA knots. Here we characterize the ideal geometric configurations of catenanes (called links by mathematicians), i. e., closed curves in space that are topologically linked to each other. We demonstrate that the ideal configurations of different catenanes show interrelations {{very similar to those}} observed in the ideal configurations of knots. By analyzing literature data on electrophoretic separations of the torus-type of DNA catenanes with increasing complexity, we observed that their <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>migration</b> is roughly proportional to the overall compactness of ideal representations of the corresponding catenanes. This correlation does not apply, however, to <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>migration</b> of certain replication intermediates, believed up to now to represent the simplest torus-type catenanes.
