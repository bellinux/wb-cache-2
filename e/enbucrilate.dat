5000|$|... n-Butyl {{cyanoacrylate}} (n-BCA, NBCA), a cyanoacrylate ester, is a {{butyl ester}} of 2-cyano-2-propenoic acid. It {{is a clear}} colorless liquid with a sharp, irritating odor. It is insoluble in water. Its chief use is as {{the main component of}} medical cyanoacrylate glues. It can be encountered under various trade names, e.g. MediBond, MediCryl, PeriAcryl, GluStitch, Xoin, Gesika, VetGlu, Vetbond, LiquiVet, Indermil, LiquiBand, Histoacryl, IFABond and others. [...] The generic international nonproprietary name (INN) for NBCA is <b>enbucrilate.</b>|$|E
40|$|Summary: High-speed biplane {{angiography}} {{is used to}} de-termine {{the path}} and velocity of microdroplets of contrast material in three dimensions. By allowing more accurate determination of detailed blood flow in feeding vessels and draining veins of cerebral arteriovenous malformations than available with standard angiography, the new method offers the potential for more accurate treatment and fur-ther study of neurovascular/cerebrovascular hemodynam-ics. The first study of the method is presented. Details of blood flow can influence the progression of vessel disease (1 – 4). Also, for improved endo-vascular treatment of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) with n-butyl cyanoacrylate (<b>enbucrilate)</b> embolic material, {{it is essential to}} determine ac-curately its transit time from the feeding vessel...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Ovarian vein {{embolization}} {{has been}} used recently to treat pelvic congestion syndrome. The {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of ovarian vein embolization in the treatment of symptomatic pelvic varices. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed ovarian vein embolization in 41 patients (mean age, 37. 8 years; range, 30 - 58 years) : 32 patients underwent unilateral embolization and nine patients underwent bilateral embolization. All had lower abdominal pain and pelvic varicosities were found on retrograde ovarian vein venography. Embolization was performed with a mixture of <b>enbucrilate</b> and lipiodized oil in all but one patient, in whom <b>enbucrilate</b> and minicoils were used. Initial technical success rate and clinical follow-up (1 - 61 months; mean, 19. 9 months), conducted with use of mailed questionnaires, are reported. RESULTS: Initial technical success rate was 98 %. Immediate complications were noted in two patients (4 %) in the form of migration of some fragments of glue (used as embolic agent), which was treated conservatively. Clinical follow-up reveals variable symptomatic relief in 9. 7 % of cases and a total relief of symptoms in 58. 5 % of cases. Results in patients who had insufficient ovarian veins bilaterally were no better than those in patients for whom only the left ovarian vein was found insufficient. CONCLUSIONS: Transcatheter embolization of the ovarian veins is a safe and feasible technique leading to complete relief of symptoms in more than half of cases. No statistically significant difference in clinical outcome could be noted between patients presenting with bilateral insufficient ovarian veins, who underwent bilateral embolization, and patients presenting with an insufficient left ovarian vein, who underwent left unilateral embolization. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectiveTwin—twin {{transfusion}} {{syndrome is}} a serious obstetric complication unique to monochorionic twin gestations. Occlusion of vessel anastomoses is recommended to improve the perinatal outcome. Case ReportA 36 -year-old, gravida 1, woman had a monochorionic twin pregnancy which {{was found to be}} affected by twin—twin transfusion syndrome at 26 weeks' gestation. The condition was successfully treated by occlusion of placental vessel anastomoses using <b>enbucrilate</b> under color Doppler ultrasonographic guidance. At 35 weeks of gestation, two male infants were delivered by cesarean section. The birth weights of the babies were 2, 470 and 1, 750 g, and both were thriving. ConclusionTargeted therapeutic ablation of vessel anastomoses involved in twin—twin transfusion syndrome using color Doppler ultrasonographic guidance is minimally invasive and may effectively obliterate interfetal transfusion, contributing to the survival of both twins...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurposeTranscatheter {{endovascular}} embolization {{within a}} reasonable time before rupture or deterioration of a patient's general condition is an important procedure for managing visceral pseudoaneurysms. N-butyl 2 -cyanoacrylate (NBCA, <b>enbucrilate)</b> is an embolic material used in the blockade of visceral pseudoaneurysms. This study evaluated the clinical efficacy of transcatheter embolization of visceral artery pseudoaneurysms using NBCA. Patients and methodsBetween June 2004 and February 2014, 13 patients (9 males and 4  females; age range, 26 – 80 years; mean, 57. 9 years) with 14 pseudoaneurysms were treated by transcatheter embolization using NBCA. NBCA was mixed with iodized oil at a 1 : 3 ratio to control its polymerization time and to render it radiopaque. Pseudoaneurysms were located on the gastroduodenal artery (n= 1), pancreaticoduodenal artery (n= 2), dorsal pancreatic artery (n= 1), proximal jejunal artery (n= 1), colic artery (n= 1), splenic artery (n= 3), renal artery (n= 4; two in one patient), and hepatic artery (n= 1). ResultsAll patients recovered immediately following the embolization procedure, and two patients showed minor complications that required only medical observation. ConclusionsTranscatheter embolization using NBCA {{for the treatment of}} visceral pseudoaneurysms is a safe, effective, and low-cost treatment method with a high success rate...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction A chorioangioma is {{the most}} common benign tumor of the placenta. The {{majority}} of pregnancies with chorioangiomas are asymptomatic. Pregnancies with large chorioangiomas are associated with maternal and fetal complications, such as growth restriction, cardiomegaly, congestive heart failure, fetal anemia, thrombocytopenia, nonimmune hydrops and intrauterine fetal death. There are several modalities of treatment published to date with various results. Our case was the third such case report published on the successful treatment with antenatal embolization of the feeding vessel of the chorioangioma. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no published cases about antenatal treatment of placental chorioangiomas in Saudi Arabia, or any other Gulf state. Case presentation We describe the case of a 28 -year-old Arab woman diagnosed at 22 [*]weeks of gestation with a chorioangioma. A glue material - <b>enbucrilate</b> (Histoacryl) - was used for embolization of the feeding vessel. Intrauterine fetal blood transfusions were performed twice, as a treatment for fetal anemia. The fetus developed heart failure at 30 [*]weeks of gestation. A Cesarean section was performed and the outcome was a live baby with right ventricular hypertrophy. The baby was admitted to our neonatal intensive care unit and discharged at 42 [*]days following birth in a stable condition,with follow-up with our cardiology team. Conclusion In this case, we found that intrauterine embolization of the feeding vessel of a chorioangioma with Histoacryl was a valid treatment option that carried a small risk considering the good pregnancy outcome. </p...|$|E
