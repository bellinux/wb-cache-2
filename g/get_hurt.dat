5|$|After failing his {{examinations}} Serevi {{quit school}} {{and continued to}} play for his local club Rewa. Although he trained with the team, he was omitted from playing as the coach, Jo Rauto, thought he was too small and would <b>get</b> <b>hurt.</b> He was eventually selected {{to play for the}} senior provincial side when he was 17. Several months later he was asked to join the Nabua Rugby Club – under the guidance of coach Ratu Kitione Tuibua – by his uncle Vesito Rauluni.

25|$|Throughout his cricket career, {{which lasted}} from 1948 until the 1977 season, Close {{was one of}} the most charismatic and {{well-known}} cricketers. He scored almost 35,000runs as a batsman, including 52centuries with a highest innings score of 198. He also took 1,168wickets as a bowler, over 800catches as a fielder and one stumping, as a stand-in wicket-keeper. At just over six feet (1.83 m) tall he was a noticeable presence on the field, often fielding at the short leg position, close to the batsman. As cricketers did not use head or body protection in Close's day, he would often <b>get</b> <b>hurt</b> when a batsman struck a ball that hit him. Close was also noted, as a batsman, for standing up to intimidatory bowling, letting the ball hit his unprotected torso rather than flinching.|$|E

25|$|It {{is thought}} that during the hunt only {{those people who have}} been {{selected}} by the spirit of the sea could kill the whale. The hunter has to please the killed whale: it must be treated as a guest. Just like a polite host does not leave a recently arrived dear guest alone, thus similarly, the killed whale should not be left alone by the host (i.e. by the hunter who has killed it). Like a guest, it should not <b>get</b> <b>hurt</b> or feel sad. It must be entertained (e.g. by drum music, good foods). On the next whale migration (whales migrate twice a year, in spring to the north and in the autumn back), the previously killed whale is sent off back to the sea {{in the course of a}} farewell ritual. If the killed whale was pleased to (during its being a guest for a half year), then it can be hoped that it will return later, too: thus, also the future whale hunts will succeed.|$|E

Also, a quarterback competition between Christian Hackenberg and Tyler Ferguson brewed, which provided intrigue entering the season. For Penn State to achieve success, they needed to avoid injuries that would hinder their already depleted depth due to NCAA sanctions. SBNation.com asserted, [...] "If either Hackenberg or Ferguson gets hurt, {{and the other one}} stinks ... if either Zach Zwinak or Bill Belton (who missed four games last year) gets hurt ... if basically any linemen <b>get</b> <b>hurt</b> (and linemen often <b>get</b> <b>hurt)</b> ... this house of cards comes tumbling down."

File-sharing networks such as Napster were flooded with bogus files bearing the titles' names.

The song's opening lyrics, [...] "Party girls don't <b>get</b> <b>hurt,</b> can't feel anything ... I push it down", are sung over a reggae-influenced background. Walker noted that during the chorus, Sia sings, [...] "I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier/ I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist, like it doesn't exist". A few critics compared the song's musical style to works done by Rihanna, including Jeremy Gordon from Pitchfork Media, and Melinda Newman of HitFix.|$|E

500|$|Starting on September 29, 1983, a {{layer of}} {{concrete}} was poured {{on top of the}} crushed materials, a rare occurrence in waste disposal. An anonymous workman's stated reason for the concrete was: [...] "There are dead animals down there. We wouldn't want any children to <b>get</b> <b>hurt</b> digging in the dump." [...] Eventually, the city began to protest the large amount of dumping Atari was doing, with one commissioner stating that the area did not want to become [...] "an industrial waste dump for El Paso." [...] The local manager ordered the dumping to be ended shortly afterwards. Due to Atari's unpopular dumping, Alamogordo later passed an Emergency Management Act and created the Emergency Management Task Force to limit the future flexibility of the garbage contractor to secure outside business for the landfill for monetary purposes.

[...] "One thing I learned {{a long time ago}} is, you gotta be careful how you change [...] basic model pack", Jean said in the episode's DVD commentary. He also said that he was happy that many viewers identify with the characters and don't want to see them <b>get</b> <b>hurt</b> or injured in any way. [...] "They don't mind if [...] falls down a cliff but [...] he should recover." [...] While working on the episode, the series' staff debated what size to make Homer's pupils when he is under the influence of marijuana. Because a common effect of smoking marijuana is to get dilated pupils, the animators initially suggested to widen them, but settled on only dilating Homer's pupils slightly.|$|E

Wheeler later issued a statement in which he said that mistakes were made by the police during the event. He also said, [...] "Yesterday we saw images of a woman in her sixties injured during an arrest. That isn't good for democracy either." [...] The ACLU condemned the actions of Portland police and asked that the force [...] "end the violence against protesters. Stop the unnecessary use of crowd control weapons.
