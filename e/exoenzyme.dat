If a reaction does not occur, this means that the bacteria does not create an <b>exoenzyme</b> capable of interacting with the surroundings. If a reaction does occur, it becomes clear that the bacteria does possess an <b>exoenzyme,</b> and which macromolecule is hydrolyzed determines its identity.|$|E

Revertants isolated from non-producers that regained the ability to produce one of the <b>exoenzymes</b> always regained the ability to produce the other two as well. These results suggest that the three <b>exoenzymes</b> share a common regulatory or processing mechanism...|$|R

5000|$|Environmental {{conditions}} such as soil pH, soil temperature, moisture content, and plant litter type and quality [...] {{have the potential to}} alter <b>exoenzyme</b> expression and activity. Variations in seasonal temperatures can shift metabolic needs of microorganisms in synchrony with shifts in plant nutrient requirements. [...] Agricultural practices such as fertilizer amendments and tillage can change the spatial distribution of resources, resulting in altered <b>exoenzyme</b> activity in the soil profile. [...] Introduction of moisture exposes soil organic matter to enzyme catalysis [...] and also increases loss of soluble monomers via diffusion. Additionally, osmotic shock resulting from water potential changes can impact enzyme activities as microbes redirect energy from enzyme production to synthesizing osmolytes to maintain cellular structures.|$|E
50|$|An endoenzyme, or {{intracellular}} enzyme, is {{an enzyme}} that functions within the cell {{in which it}} was produced. Because the majority of enzymes fall within this category, the term is used primarily to differentiate a specific enzyme from an <b>exoenzyme.</b> It is possible for a single enzyme to have both endoenzymatic and exoenzymatic functions; for example, glycolytic enzymes of Kreb's Cycle. In most cases the term endoenzyme refers to an enzyme that binds to a bond 'within the body' of a large molecule - usually a polymer. For example an endoamylase would break down large amylose molecules into shorter dextrin chains. On the other hand, an <b>exoenzyme</b> removes subunits from the polymer one at a time from one end; in effect it can only act at the end ponts of a polymer. An exoamylase would therefore remove one glucose molecule at a time from the end of an amylose molecule.|$|E

5000|$|Pectinases, {{also called}} pectolytic enzymes, are {{a class of}} <b>exoenzymes</b> that are {{involved}} in the breakdown of pectic substances, most notably pectin. Pectinases can be classified into two different groups based on their action against the galacturonan backbone of pectin: de-esterifying and depolymerizing. [...] These <b>exoenzymes</b> can be found in both plants and microbial organisms including fungi and bacteria. [...] Pectinases are most often used to break down the pectic elements found in plants and plant-derived products.|$|R
50|$|In {{eukaryotic}} cells, <b>exoenzymes</b> {{are manufactured}} {{like any other}} enzyme via protein synthesis, and are transported via the secretory pathway. After moving through the rough endoplasmic reticulum, they are processed through the Golgi apparatus, where they are packaged in vesicles and released out of the cell. In humans, a majority of such <b>exoenzymes</b> {{can be found in}} the digestive system and are used for metabolic breakdown of macronutrients via hydrolysis. Breakdown of these nutrients allows for their incorporation into other metabolic pathways.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the role of}} Pseudomonas aeruginosa <b>exoenzymes</b> in cystic fibrosis lung infection in the presence and absence of specific serum antibodies. In sputa of 21 cystic fibrosis patients, concentrations of P. aeruginosa proteases and exotoxin A were determined by sensitive radioimmunoassays. In all sputa, detection of <b>exoenzymes</b> was negative (less {{than or equal to}} 10 ng). Positive serum antibody titers to bacterial <b>exoenzymes</b> were found in the majority of patients. Purified immunoglobulin G (IgG) preparations from the sera of two patients revealing specific antibody titers to the bacterial proteases neutralized these enzymes at ratios of 1, 000 : 1 to 5, 600 : 1 (wt/wt). Above the neutralizing capacity of IgG, proteases caused cleavage of IgG; below that level, no enzymatic activity was observed. In vitro incubation of P. aeruginosa elastase, alkaline protease, or exotoxin A with elastase derived from polymorphonuclear leukocytes showed that polymorphonuclear leukocyte elastase: (i) was cleaved by bacterial elastase, (ii) was not inactivated by alkaline protease, and (iii) inactivated exotoxin A. The results suggest that soon after the onset of P. aeruginosa lung infection in cystic fibrosis patients, bacterial proteases, but not exotoxin A, become important virulence factors. The results also suggest that <b>exoenzymes</b> do not directly contribute to lung damage after immune response to bacterial antigens has begun...|$|R
50|$|P. aeruginosa {{uses the}} {{virulence}} factor exotoxin A to inactivate eukaryotic elongation factor 2 via ADP-ribosylation {{in the host}} cell, much as the diphtheria toxin does. Without elongation factor 2, eukaryotic cells cannot synthesize proteins and necrotise. The release of intracellular contents induces an immunologic response in immunocompetent patients.In addition P. aeruginosa uses an <b>exoenzyme,</b> ExoU, which degrades the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells, leading to lysis. Increasingly, it is becoming recognized that the iron-acquiring siderophore, pyoverdine, also functions as a toxin by removing iron from mitochondria, inflicting damage on this organelle.|$|E

It is produced as an extracellular, cell surface-anchored lipoprotein by Gram-negative bacteria of the genus Klebsiella. Type I pullulanases specifically attack α-1,6 linkages, while type II pullulanases are also able to hydrolyse α-1,4 linkages. It is also produced by some other bacteria and archaea. Pullulanase {{is used as a}} processing aid in grain processing biotechnology (production of ethanol and sweeteners).|$|E
5000|$|An <b>exoenzyme,</b> or {{extracellular}} enzyme, is {{an enzyme}} that is secreted by a cell and functions {{outside of that}} cell. Exoenzymes are produced by both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and {{have been shown to}} be a crucial component of many biological processes. Most often these enzymes are involved in the breakdown of larger macromolecules. The breakdown of these larger macromolecules is critical for allowing their constituents to pass through the cell membrane and enter into the cell. For humans and other complex organisms, this process is best characterized by the digestive system which breaks down solid food [...] via exoenzymes. The small molecules, generated by the <b>exoenzyme</b> activity, enter into cells and are utilized for various cellular functions. Bacteria and fungi also produce exoenzymes to digest nutrients in their environment, and these organisms can be used to conduct laboratory assays to identify the presence and function of such exoenzymes. Some pathogenic species also use exoenzymes as virulence factors to assist in the spread of these disease causing microorganisms. In addition to the integral roles in biological systems, different classes of microbial exoenzymes have been used by humans since pre-historic times for such diverse purposes as food production, biofuels, textile production and in the paper industry. [...] Another important role that microbial exoenzymes serve is in the natural ecology and bioremediation of terrestrial and marine environments.|$|E

5000|$|Very limited {{information}} is available about the original discovery of <b>exoenzymes.</b> According to Merriam-Webster dictionary, the term [...] "exoenzyme" [...] was first recognized in the English language in 1908. The book [...] "Intracellular Enzymes: A Course of Lectures Given in the Physiological," [...] by Horace Vernon {{is thought to be}} the first publication using this word in that year. Based on the book, it can be assumed that the first known <b>exoenzymes</b> were pepsin and trypsin, as both are mentioned by Vernon to have been discovered by scientists Briike and Kiihne before 1908.|$|R
5000|$|Biopolymers are {{structurally}} {{complex and}} require the combined {{actions of a}} community of diverse microorganisms and their secreted <b>exoenzymes</b> to depolymerize the polysaccharides into easily assimilable monomers. These microbial communities are ubiquitous in nature, inhabiting both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. The cycling of elements from dead organic matter by heterotrophic soil microorganisms is essential for nutrient turnover and energy transfer in terrestrial ecosystems. [...] <b>Exoenzymes</b> also aid digestion in the guts of ruminants, termites, humans and herbivores. By hydrolyzing plant cell wall polymers, microbes release energy {{that has the potential}} to be used by humans as biofuel. [...] Other human uses include waste water treatment, composting [...] and bioethanol production.|$|R
50|$|Discovered in 1836, pepsin {{was one of}} {{the first}} enzymes to be {{classified}} as an <b>exoenzyme.</b> The enzyme is first made in the inactive form, pepsinogen by chief cells in the lining of the stomach. With an impulse from the vagus nerve, pepsinogen is secreted into the stomach, where it mixes with hydrochloric acid to form pepsin. Once active, pepsin works to break down proteins in foods such as dairy, meat, and eggs. Pepsin works best at the pH of gastric acid, 1.5 to 2.5, and is deactivated when the acid is neutralized to a pH of 7.|$|E
50|$|One {{example of}} {{behavior}} that is modulated by Rho GTPase proteins is in the healing of wounds. Wounds heal differently between young chicks and adult chickens. In young chicks, wounds heal by contraction, much like a draw-string being pulled to close a bag. In older chickens, cells crawl across the wound through locomotion. The actin formation required to close the wounds in young chicks is controlled by Rho GTPase proteins, since, after injection of a bacterial <b>exoenzyme</b> used to block rho and rac activity, the actin polymers do not form, and thus the healing completely fails.|$|E
5000|$|Many exoenzymes {{are also}} used as {{virulence}} factors. Pathogens, both bacterial and fungal, can use exoenzymes as a primary mechanism with which to cause disease. [...] The metabolic activity of the exoenzymes allows the bacterium to invade host organisms by breaking down the host cells' defensive outer layers or by necrotizing body tissues of larger organisms. [...] Many gram-negative bacteria have injectisomes, or flagella-like projections, to directly deliver the virulent <b>exoenzyme</b> into the host cell using a type three secretion system. With either process, pathogens can attack the host cell's structure and function, {{as well as its}} nucleic DNA.|$|E
50|$|C3-like <b>exoenzymes</b> {{unlike other}} ADP-ribosyltransferase toxins {{do not require}} a {{specific}} cell-surface binding translocation component for cell entry.

40|$|The reuse of {{reclaimed}} wastewater {{for irrigation}} of agricultural fields greatly influences {{the activity of}} soil microorganisms through the input of organic compounds. Due {{to the production of}} <b>exoenzymes</b> by microorganisms for the decomposition of substrates it can be assumed that the irrigation with treated wastewater (TWW) has a strong influence on the soil enzyme pool. In this study the activity of ten <b>exoenzymes,</b> which catalyses processes in C, N and P nutrient cycles, were determined in 3 different soils in 0 - 10, 10 - 20, 20 - 30, 30 - 50, 50 - 70 and 70 - 100 cm soil depth. The soils were used for agriculture and irrigated with reclaimed wastewater reused after a secondary treatment step. Additionally a control after freshwater irrigation was studied. Due to the influence of TWW on the soil biology of these soils, also clear effects on soil <b>exoenzymes</b> in freshwater and TWW irrigated soils could be seen. According to Sinsabaugh et al. (2008) we calculated indices which describe the enzymatic resources for acquisition of organic P and organic N relative to C and therefore give insides into the functional convergence of extracellular enzyme activities in soils and the relative nutrient demand. The distribution pattern of these functional enzyme activities varied between freshwater and TWW irrigated soils and shows therefore a strong influence of the TWW irrigation on the activity of <b>exoenzymes.</b> (Sinsabaugh et al.

5000|$|Extracellular enzyme {{production}} supplements {{the direct}} uptake of nutrients by microorganisms and {{is linked to}} nutrient availability and environmental conditions. The varied chemical structure of organic matter requires a suite of extracellular enzymes to access the carbon and nutrients embedded in detritus. Microorganisms differ {{in their ability to}} break down these different substrates and few organisms have the potential to degrade all the available plant cell wall materials. [...] To detect the presence of complex polymers, some exoenzymes are produced constitutively at low levels, and expression is upregulated when the substrate is abundant. [...] This sensitivity to the presence of varying concentrations of substrate allows fungi to respond dynamically to the changing availability of specific resources. Benefits of <b>exoenzyme</b> production can also be lost after secretion because the enzymes are liable to denature, degrade or diffuse away from the producer cell.|$|E
5000|$|Fungi {{have been}} shown to be viable organisms to conduct {{bioremediation}} and have been used to aid in the decontamination of a number of pollutants including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pesticides, synthetic dyes, chlorophenols, explosives, crude oil and many others. [...] While fungi can breakdown many of these contaminants intracellularly, they also secrete numerous oxidative exoenzymes that work extracellularly. One critical aspect of fungi in regards to bioremediation is that they secrete these oxidative exoenzymes from their ever elongating hyphal tips. [...] Laccases are an important oxidative enzyme that fungi secrete and use oxygen to oxidize many pollutants. Some of the pollutants that laccases have been used to treat include dye-containing effluents from the textile industry, wastewater pollutants (chlorophenols, PAHs, etc.), and sulphur-containing compounds from coal processing.Bacteria are also a viable source of exoenzymes capable to facilitating the bioremediation of the environment. There are many examples of the use of bacteria for this purpose and their exoenzymes encompass many different classes of bacterial enzymes. Of particular interest in this field are bacterial hydrolases as they have an intrinsic low substrate specificity and can be used for numerous pollutants including solid wastes. [...] Plastic wastes including polyurethanes are particularly hard to degrade, but an <b>exoenzyme</b> has been identified in a Gram-negative bacterium, Comamonas acidovorans, that was capable of degrading polyurethane waste in the environment. [...] Cell-free use of microbial exoenzymes as agents of bioremediation is also possible although their activity is often not as robust and introducing the enzymes into certain environments such as soil has been challenging. [...] In addition to terrestrial based microorganisms, marine based bacteria and their exoenzymes show potential as candidates in the field of bioremediation. Marine based bacteria have been utilized in the removal of heavy metals, petroleum/diesel degradation and in the removal of polyaromatic hydrocarbons among others.|$|E
