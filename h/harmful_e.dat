40|$|We {{report a}} meta-analytic review of studies {{examining}} the relations among harmful workplace experiences and women’s occupational well-being. Based on previous research, a classification of harmful workplace experiences affecting women is proposed and then {{used in the}} analysis of 88 studies with 93 independent samples, containing 73, 877 working women. We compare the associations of different harmful workplace experiences and job stressors with women’s work attitudes and health. Random-effects meta-analysis and path analysis showed that more intense yet less frequent <b>harmful</b> experiences (<b>e.</b> g., sexual coercion and unwanted sexual attention) and less intense but more frequent <b>harmful</b> experiences (<b>e.</b> g., sexist organizational climate and gender harassment) had similar negative effects on women’s well-being. Harmful workplace experiences were independent from and as negative as job stressors in their impact on women’s occupational well-being. The power imbalance between the target and the perpetrator appeared as a potential factor to explain the type and impact of harmful workplace experiences affecting women’s occupational well-being. In the discussion, we identify several gaps in the literature, suggest directions for future research, and suggest organizational policy changes and interventions that could be effective at reducing the incidence of harmful workplace experiences.

In the ALPHASET system phenol-formaldehyde resin of resole type is cured with a liquid mixture of esters. Under the influence of the molten metal the thermal decomposition of the binder follows, resulting in the evolution of gases, often <b>harmful,</b> <b>e.</b> g. from benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX) or Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) groups. The identification of gases evolved during the pyrolysis of the binders was carried out and their decomposition temperatures were determined using the Thermogravimetry–Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (TG–GC–MS) technique. The tests were subjected to two types of binders from different manufacturers. Among the products of pyrolysis there have been identified mainly benzene and its derivatives, and phenol and its derivatives. Compounds identified in pyrolytic gas are largely considered to be harmful to humans and the environment (some of the compounds are carcinogenic and mutagenic).

40|$|Delayed-type {{hypersensitivity}} (DTH) {{reactions are}} antigen-specific cell-mediated immune responses that, {{depending on the}} antigen, mediate beneficial (e. g., resistance to viruses, bacteria, and fungi) or <b>harmful</b> (<b>e.</b> g., allergic dermatitis and autoimmunity) aspects of immune function. Contrary {{to the idea that}} stress suppresses immunity, we have reported that short-duration stressors significantly enhance skin DTH and that a stress-induced trafficking of leukocytes to the skin may mediate this immunoenhancement. Here, we identify the hormonal mediators of a stress-induced enhancement of skin immunity. Adrenalectomy, which eliminates the glucocorticoid and epinephrine stress response, eliminated the stress-induced enhancement of skin DTH. Low-dose corticosterone or epinephrine administration significantly enhanced skin DTH and produced {{a significant increase in the}} number of T cells in lymph nodes draining the site of the DTH reaction. In contrast, high-dose corticosterone, chronic corticosterone, or low-dose dexamethasone administration significantly suppressed skin DTH. These results suggest a role for adrenal stress hormones as endogenous immunoenhancing agents. These results also show that hormones released during an acute stress response may help prepare the immune system for potential challenges (e. g., wounding or infection) for which stress perception by the brain may serve as an early warning signal...|$|E

40|$|Rosiglitazone is a thiazolidinedione (TZD), a {{synthetic}} PPARγ receptor agonist with insulin-sensitizing properties {{that is used}} as an anti-diabetic drug. In addition to improving glycemic control through actions in metabolic target tissues, rosiglitazone has numerous biological actions that impact on cardiovascular homeostasis. Some of these actions are helpful (e. g., improving endothelial function) while others are potentially <b>harmful</b> (<b>e.</b> g., promoting fluid retention). Since cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are major endpoints for diabetes, {{it is essential to}} understand how the natural history of diabetes alters the net benefits and risks of rosiglitazone therapy. This complex issue is an important determinant of optimal use of rosiglitazone and is critical for understanding cardiovascular safety issues. We give special attention to the effects of rosiglitazone in diabetic patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) and the impact of rosiglitazone actions on atherosclerosis and plaque instability. This provides a rational conceptual framework for predicting evolving benefit/risk profiles that inform optimal use of rosiglitazone in the clinical setting and help explaining results of recent large clinical intervention trials where rosiglitazone had disappointing cardiovascular outcomes. Thus, in this review, we describe what is known about the molecular mechanisms of action of rosiglitazone on cardiovascular targets {{in the context of the}} evolving pathophysiology of diabetes over its natural history...|$|E

40|$|Aerobic organisms {{maintain}} O 2 homeostasis by {{responding to}} changes in O 2 supply and demand in both short and long time domains. In this review, we introduce several specific examples of respiratory plasticity induced by chronic changes in O 2 supply (environmental hypoxia or hyperoxia) and demand (exercise-induced and temperature-induced changes in aerobic metabolism). These studies reveal that plasticity occurs throughout the respiratory system, including modifications to the gas exchanger, respiratory pigments, respiratory muscles, and the neural control systems responsible for ventilating the gas exchanger. While some of these responses appear appropriate (e. g., increases in lung surface area, blood O 2 capacity, and pulmonary ventilation in hypoxia), other responses are potentially <b>harmful</b> (<b>e.</b> g., increased muscle fatigability). Thus, {{it may be difficult}} to predict whole-animal performance based on the plasticity of a single system. Moreover, plastic responses may differ quantitatively and qualitatively at different developmental stages. Much of the current research in this field is focused on identifying the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying respiratory plasticity. These studies suggest that a few key molecules, such as hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) and erythropoietin, may be involved in the expression of diverse forms of plasticity within and across species. Studying the various ways in which animals respond to respiratory challenges will enable a better understanding of the integrative response to chronic changes in O 2 supply and deman...|$|E
40|$|The {{balanced}} partitioning problem {{divides the}} nodes of a [hyper]graph into groups of approximately equal weight (i. e., satisfying balance constraints) while minimizing {{the number of}} [hyper]edges that are cut (i. e., adjacent to nodes in di erent groups). Classic iterative algorithms use the pass paradigm [24] in performing single-node moves [16, 13] to improve the initial solution. To satisfy particular balance constraints, it is usual to require that intermediate solutions satisfy the constraints. Hence, many possible moves are rejected. Hypergraph partitioning heuristics have been traditionally proposed for and evaluated on hypergraphs with unit node weights only. Nevertheless, many real-world applications entail varying node weights, e. g., VLSI circuit partitioning where node weight typically represents cell area. Even when multilevel partitioning [3] is performed on unit-node-weight hypergraphs, intermediate clustered hypergraphs have varying node weights. Nothing prevents the use of conventional move-based heuristics when node weights vary, but their performance deteriorates, as shown by our analysis of partitioning results in [1]. We describe two e ects that cause this deterioration and propose simple modi cations of well-known algorithms to address them. Our baseline implementations achieve dramatic improvements over previously reported results (by factors of up to 25); explicitly addressing the described <b>harmful</b> <b>e</b> ects provides further improvement. Overall results are superior {{to those of the}} PROP-REX est algorithm reported in [14], which addresses similar problems. ...|$|E
