5|$|Rocket {{propellant}}: Solid <b>fuel</b> <b>rocket</b> propellant began {{during the}} 1200s during the medieval Chinese Song dynasty {{at a time}} when bows, arrows, and catapult-based projectile launchers were state of the art military technology in medieval Europe. The Song Chinese invented solid propellant rockets in 1232 during the military siege of Kaifeng. The rocket propellants were powered by solid gunpowder fuel.|$|E
5|$|The {{intensity}} of the fire fed by pure oxygen caused the pressure to rise to , which ruptured the Command Module's inner wall at 6:31:19 (23:31:19 GMT, initial phase of the fire). Flames and gases then rushed outside the Command Module through open access panels to two levels of the pad service structure. Intense heat, dense smoke, and ineffective gas masks designed for toxic fumes rather than heavy smoke hampered the ground crew's attempts to rescue the men. There were fears the Command Module had exploded, or soon would, and that the fire might ignite the solid <b>fuel</b> <b>rocket</b> in the launch escape tower above the Command Module, which would have likely killed nearby ground personnel, and possibly have destroyed the pad.|$|E

25|$|On December 6, 1925, {{he tested}} the simpler {{pressure}} feed system. He conducted a static test on the firing {{stand at the}} Clark University physics laboratory. The engine successfully lifted its own weight in a 27-second test in the static rack. It was a major success for Goddard, proving that a liquid <b>fuel</b> <b>rocket</b> was possible. The test moved Goddard an important step closer to launching a rocket with liquid fuel.|$|E
25|$|The rockoon (a {{portmanteau}} of rocket and balloon) {{was a solid}} <b>fuel</b> <b>rocket</b> that, {{rather than}} being immediately lit while on the ground, was first carried into the upper atmosphere by a gas-filled balloon. Then, once separated from the balloon at its maximum height, the rocket was automatically ignited. This achieved a higher altitude, since the rocket {{did not have to}} move through the lower thicker air layers that would have required much more chemical fuel.|$|E

As well, Korolev was designing the Luna series of vehicles that would soft-land on the Moon and make robotic missions to Mars and Venus. Unexpectedly, he died in January 1966, before he could see his various plans brought to fruition.|$|E
25|$|The {{first stage}} {{was to have}} been a more {{powerful}} and reusable solid <b>fuel</b> <b>rocket</b> derived from the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster (SRB). Compared with the Solid Rocket Booster, which had four segments, the most notable difference was the addition of a fifth segment. This fifth segment would have enabled the Ares I to produce more thrust. Other changes made to the Solid Rocket Booster were to have been the removal of the Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) attachment points and the replacement of the Solid Rocket Booster nosecone with a new forward adapter that would have interfaced with the liquid-fueled second stage. The adapter {{was to have been}} equipped with solid-fueled separation motors to facilitate the disconnection of the stages during ascent. The grain design was also changed, and so were the insulation and liner. By the Ares I first stage ground test, the case, grain design, number of segments, insulation, liner, throat diameter, thermal protection systems and nozzle had all changed.|$|E

50|$|When {{a rocket}} launches, it sends out {{large amounts of}} gas called a rocket plume. A rocket’s plume is made of various gases that {{are a result of}} the {{combustion}} of the fuel source used to propel the rocket into space. There are two main types of rocket engine fuels: solid <b>rocket</b> motor <b>fuels</b> and liquid <b>rocket</b> engine <b>fuels.</b> Solid <b>rocket</b> <b>fuels</b> are considered to be more harmful to ozone than liquid <b>rocket</b> <b>fuels.</b> It is estimated that global ozone depletion results from a mixture of solid and liquid <b>rocket</b> <b>fuel</b> emissions. Solid <b>rocket</b> <b>fuels</b> are more durable and {{do not have to be}} stored under certain conditions. Liquid <b>rocket</b> <b>fuel</b> is better in use because the rocket thrust can be adjusted mid-flight unlike solid <b>rocket</b> <b>fuel</b> that burns at a fixed rate without any mechanism to alter it.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to obtain an improved understanding of droplet turbulence interactions in vaporizing liquid sprays under conditions typical of those encountered in liquid <b>fueled</b> <b>rocket</b> engines. The interaction between liquid droplets and the surrounding turbulent gas flow affects droplet dispersion, droplet collisions, droplet vaporization and gas-phase, fuel-oxidant mixing, and therefore has a significant effect on the engine's combustion characteristics. An example of this is the role which droplet-turbulence interactions are believed to play in combustion instabilities. Despite their importance, droplet-turbulence interactions and their effect on liquid <b>fueled</b> <b>rocket</b> engine performance are not well understood. This is particularly true under supercritical conditions, where many conventional concepts, such as surface tension, no longer apply. Our limited understanding of droplet-turbulence interactions, under both subcritical conditions, represents a major limitation in our ability to design improved liquid previously unavailable information and valuable new insights which will directly impact the design of future liquid <b>fueled</b> <b>rocket</b> engines, as well as, allow for the development of significantly improved spray combustion models, making such models useful design tools...|$|R
