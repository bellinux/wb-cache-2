40|$|This {{research}} {{was about the}} effects of self-concept, motivation, and discipline on the performance of the primary school principals at Jagakarsa regency of South Jakarta. The objectives of this research were: <b>determining</b> <b>whether</b> self-concept has a direct effect on discipline, <b>determining</b> <b>whether</b> motivation has a direct effect on discipline, <b>determining</b> <b>whether</b> discipline has a direct effect on performance, <b>determining</b> <b>whether</b> the self-concept has direct effect on performance, <b>determining</b> <b>whether</b> the motivation has a direct effect on performance, <b>determining</b> <b>whether</b> the self-concept has an indirect effect on performance but through discipline, and <b>determining</b> <b>whether</b> the motivation have an indirect effect on performance through discipline. The {{research was}} conducted by survey method with path-analysis. The sample size was 63 principals of the school. The result is as follows : (1) that the self-concept directly affect the discipline of the principals; (2) the motivation directly affect their discipline, and (3) the discipline directly affect their performance, therefore, improvement of performance of to the principal should be improved by enhancing the rules and working standard. ...|$|R
