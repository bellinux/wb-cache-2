40|$|The eciency of HPF {{with respect}} to {{irregular}} applications is still largely unproven. While recent work has shown that a highly irregular hierarchical n-body force calculation method can be implemented in HPF, {{we have found that}} the implmentation contains ine- ciencies which cause it to run up to a factor of three times slower than our hand-coded, explicitly parallel implementation. Our work examines these ineciencies, determines that most of the extra overhead is due to a single aspect of the communication strategy, and demonstrates that xing the communication strategy can bring the overheads of the HPF application to within 25 % of those of the hand-coded version. 1 Introduction High Performance Fortran (HPF) [7, 10] was developed to simplify parallel programming by having compilers manage most of the <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> parallelization.

30|$|This paper {{provides}} a strategic solution for enhancing the cybersecurity of {{power distribution system}} operations when information and operation technologies converge in active distribution network (ADN). The paper first investigates the significance of Internet of Things (IoT) in enabling fine-grained observability and controllability of ADN in networked microgrids. Given severe cybersecurity vulnerabilities embedded in conventionally centralized energy management schemes, the paper then proposes a cyber-secure decentralized energy management framework that applies a distributed decision-making intelligence to networked microgrids while securing their individual mandates for optimal operation. In particular, the proposed framework takes advantage of software-defined networking technologies that can secure communications among IoT devices in individual microgrids, and exploits potentials for introducing blockchain technologies that can preserve the integrity of communications among networked microgrids in ADN. Furthermore, the paper presents the <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> scenarios where the proposed framework is employed to secure peer-to-peer transactive energy management based {{on a set of}} interoperable blockchains. It is finally concluded that the proposed framework can {{play a significant role in}} enhancing the efficiency, reliability, resilience, and sustainability of electricity services in ADN.|$|E

The Java Card API {{provides}} a framework of classes and interfaces that hides {{the details of the}} underlying smart card interface, thus relieving de-velopers from going through the swamps of microcontroller programming.

Several characteristics of the Java Card applets and their multi-ple-entry-point program structure make it possible for a potentially unhandled exception to reach the invoked entry point. This contingency opens a possibility to leave the applet in an unpredictable state that is potentially dangerous for the application’s security.
