500|$|In 2012, Hawke {{entered the}} horror genre {{for the first}} time, by playing a true crime writer in Scott Derrickson's Sinister, which grossed US$87million at the {{worldwide}} box office—the film {{was the first in}} a series of highly profitable films for Hawke after the start of the new decade. In the week prior to the US opening of Sinister, Hawke explained that he was previously turned off by horror because good acting is not always required for success; however, the producer of Sinister, Jason Blum, who formerly ran a theater company with Hawke, made the offer to the actor based on the character and director."when I was younger, I ran a theater company with this guy, Jason Blum. And he loved horror movies and he went on to create his own little subgenre with [...] "Paranormal Activity." [...] And he kept trying to talk to me about how I should love this whole genre. And I told him: I've never had a script with a really great character and a real filmmaker attached to it that I'd be interested in. So, <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> into it.|$|E

Jock chaired the village management board and commanded the Selukwe Company of the Southern Rhodesia Volunteers; he {{also became a}} founder member of the Selukwe Freemasons' Lodge and President of the town's football and rugby clubs. Agnes, who became informally known as [...] "Mrs Jock", established and ran the Selukwe Women's Institute. Both won the MBE (at different times) for their services to the community. [...] "My parents strove to instil principles and moral virtues, the {{sense of right and}} wrong, of integrity, in their children," [...] Ian Smith wrote in his memoirs. [...] "They set wonderful examples to live up to." [...] He considered his father [...] "a man of extremely strong principles"—"one of the fairest men I have ever met and that is the way <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> up. He always told me that we're entitled to our half of the country and the blacks are entitled to theirs." [...] Raised on the frontier of the British Empire in the UK's youngest settler colony, Smith and his generation of white Rhodesians grew up with a reputation for being [...] "more British than the British", something in which they took great pride.|$|E

2500|$|According to Pirozhkova, [...] "Before I met Babel, I {{used to read}} a great deal, though {{without any}} {{particular}} direction. I read whatever I could get my hands on. Babel noticed this and told me, 'Reading that way will get you nowhere. You won't have time to read the books that are truly worthwhile. There are about a hundred books that every educated person needs to read. Sometime I'll try {{to make you a}} list of them.' And a few days later <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> a list. There were ancient writers on it, Greek and Roman — Homer, Herodotus, Lucretius, Suetonius — and also all the classics of later European literature, starting with Erasmus, Rabelais, Cervantes, Swift, and Coster, and going on to 19th century writers such as Stendhal, Mérimée, and Flaubert." ...|$|E
2500|$|Historian John McElwee reports, in his 2013 book Showmen, Sell It Hot!, that Bela Lugosi's {{popularity}} {{received a}} much-needed boost in August 1938, when California theater owner Emil Umann revived Dracula and Frankenstein {{as a special}} double feature. The combination was so successful that Umann scheduled extra shows to accommodate the capacity crowds, and invited Lugosi to appear in person, which thrilled new audiences that had never seen Lugosi's classic performance. [...] "I owe it all to that little man at the Regina Theatre," [...] said Lugosi of exhibitor Umann. [...] "I was dead, and <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> back to life." [...] Universal took notice of the tremendous business and launched its own national re-release of the same two horror favorites. The studio then rehired Lugosi to star in new films.|$|E

After a 1–0 defeat at Nottingham Forest, with the club having won only once in the last six matches, having failed to win at home, and lying in 14th place, manager Nigel Clough was sacked. Bryson was saddened by the move, saying it came as a [...] "shock", adding that Clough [...] "has been excellent for me, <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> down from Scotland and gave me my chance in England. So obviously I was sad to see him go. But it happens in football {{and you just have to}} get on with it." [...] Clough was replaced by Steve McClaren and Bryson said that he was looking forward to working with the new manager.|$|E
