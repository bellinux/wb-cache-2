500|$|Hamming {{remained}} at Los Alamos until 1946, when he accepted a {{post at the}} [...] Bell Telephone Laboratories (BTL). For the trip to New Jersey, he bought Klaus Fuchs's old car. When he later sold it just weeks before Fuchs was unmasked as a spy, the FBI regarded the timing as suspicious enough to interrogate Hamming. Although Hamming described his role at Los Alamos as being that of a [...] "computer janitor", he saw computer simulations of experiments {{that would have been}} impossible to perform in a laboratory. [...] "And when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> think about it," [...] he later recalled, [...] "I realized that it meant that science was going to be changed".|$|E
500|$|Both Ruby and Brax decide Charlie's {{ventilator}} {{should be}} turned off as {{there is nothing more}} the doctors can do for her and Charlie dies. Speaking about her character's exit storyline, Anderson said [...] "When I read the final script for Charlie's exit, I made sure I was in the privacy of my own home. It was written really well – it was a tragic love story and I hope the fans like it." [...] The actress explained that the storyline was great and the writers had done a brilliant job with Charlie and Brax. She also said some fans would be disappointed that the couple did not end up together. Anderson revealed that the series producer had told her that after investing so much in getting Charlie together with Brax, she would not have left the Bay for another reason and killing her off was the best way. Of her reaction to the storyline, Anderson said [...] "I started sobbing! But that was the initial shock. You play this character {{for three and a half}} years and you really empathise with them. You have to love a part of them – it's a little extension of you. So it's just so final, the death. But once <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> let it sink in, now I'm really, really happy with the ending. It's very dramatic and it's definitely going out with a bang, so to speak!" [...] Anderson departed on screen on 24 January 2012.|$|E

I didn't feel limited at all. There were a lot more options, a lot more paths I could go down, more directions I could choose". Songwriter Guy Chambers had been {{keeping an eye on}} Goodrem's career and was impressed with her vocals and songwriting skills. The two writing together resulted in many of the album's key tracks. [...] "'It's really unusual to work with somebody so talented, young, and brave. Who's not scared to take risks and who has the most emotional voice in pop music", You cannot help but believe every word Delta sings." [...] Chambers states about working with Goodrem. Goodrem stated that Chambers was a classy producer and that he was an inspiration to work with. She felt they had a good connection on a musical level. [...] "There's a definite story in the tracklisting," [...] Goodrem says. [...] "I felt I had to be really honest. Songs that people could still relate to but songs that also confronted issues. This past chapter of my life has been such an intense one and I wanted people to know my thoughts".|$|E
