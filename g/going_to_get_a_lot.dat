5000|$|Throughout {{his time}} at Centenary, Parish chose not to escape {{anonymity}} by either jumping to the National Basketball Association or American Basketball Association (the latter of which existed until the ABA-NBA merger in 1976), or by transferring to another college, even though the professional ranks offered him potential riches and a transfer would have given him eligibility and far more publicity. At the time, professional scouts did not question his physical skills, but were divided as to whether his decision to stay at Centenary was a show of loyalty or evidence of poor decision-making. One NBA scout said during Parish's senior season, [...] "The {{jury is still out}} as to whether Parish can win games for a pro team.

It’s like me just going back to my history of being an emcee first, before I actually became part of Wu-Tang. I always give RZA that support as far as saying he brought Wu-Tang to the table. It was his philosophy. He picked certain dudes {{to be part of this}} group, and he said, 'This is what it’s going to be called'. Before that, I was on the block. I was living in Shaolin. So this album just shows the street side of me, challenging the great side of Wu-Tang. Which is almost like how T.I. did T.I. vs. T.I.P. You’re going to get sounds that relate to Wu-Tang. You’re going to get sounds that relate to great Rae at his best shit, too. You’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of animation as far as the skits are concerned.

She frequently scolds her husband for his sarcasm in dealing with their son. She is also shown to be on Calvin's side when they go for their usual camping trips, complaining just as much as her son about these outings; says she, [...] "a whole week without a newspaper or a decent cup of real coffee!" [...] She can sometimes calm Calvin down when he is in a bad mood, offering peanut-butter crackers, comic books and other treats to cheer him up.

5000|$|Series creator Jon Bokenkamp — in an {{interview}} for ''''The Hollywood Reporter'''' — said that the two-part story arc resembles a [...] "big heightened event movie in a very contained way." [...] When asked {{whether or not the}} episode will be fit for new viewers post-Super Bowl, Bokenkamp said: It's certainly an episode designed for a new viewer to just dive right into. In watching it, I think they will very easily {{get a sense of what}} the show is, who Reddington is, what the show tastes and feels and smells like. It's an easy show to sort of dive right into at this point, but also I think we've designed some really fun revelations and some payoffs for people who are ardent fans. In regard to preparation for new viewers, executive producer John Eisendrath said in {{an interview}} for Entertainment Weekly: Yes, we knew that it was going to be the Super Bowl. We felt as if, first of all, we were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of viewers who had never seen the show before. We wanted to make sure that we had an episode that was a good introductory episode to Red and the situation that he is in with the FBI and a standalone case. We didn’t want to confuse any new viewers with anything that may linger in other episodes that are serialized. And we wanted to have a big, impactful event for those new viewers. In casting Ron Perlman as Luther Braxton — the episode's title character — Bokenkamp said [...] "I've been a fan of Ron Perlman for a long time. He just brings this great presence to the show. I think he's going to be a memorable Blacklister." ...|$|E
5000|$|In February 2009, it was {{announced}} that Sharon Duncan Brewster had been cast as Lucas's estranged wife Trina. Entertainment website Digital Spy reported: [...] "Trina arrives and surprises Lucas and she makes it very clear she wants to give things another go. Lucas tries to get rid of her but his secret is out when Patrick (Rudolph Walker) sees what's going on. Just how willing will Trina be to let her husband walk into the arms of another woman? And more importantly, will she divorce him to enable him to marry again?" [...] Despite his connection with the church, in September 2009 Lucas attempts to cover up his involvement in Trina's death. Gilet told Soaplife magazine, [...] "When he first appeared someone wrote in saying he was a good character, but somewhere down the line something was going to come unstuck. We've always known there was more to this do-gooder than meets the eye. Things are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> darker in the build-up to Christmas. ... It's going to get very dark and I hope I can pull it off." [...] Lucas went on to kill Denise's ex-husband Owen Turner (Lee Ross) when he came close to discovering how Lucas was involved in Trina's death. Gilet explained that although Lucas does not want people dead and has no malice in his heart, he sees killing as a way to stop things from happening. When the show's executive producer Diederick Santer was asked by Digital Spy what was lined up for Lucas in 2010, he said [...] "He's got right on his side, hasn't he? Is {{the world a better place}} without Trina? Probably, yes. Is the world a better place without Owen? Well, I don't know about that, but he's not a particularly nice person... Lucas is doing the Lord's work and who knows what that's doing to his head maybe he'll kill again. Lucas's story is 'poised' and we're just trying to work out the exact timing of the long-term story. There's brilliant stuff in the pipeline [...] - [...] it's one for a slow burn really. We have Lucas who's a murderer. Will he murder again? Who's the next person to cross him? He's one dangerous man." ...|$|E

5000|$|Allmond {{started out}} {{his senior season}} with the Bearkats on November 14, 2009, with 15 points of 2-of-7 three-point {{shooting}} vs the Division III program from LeTourneau University. He said, [...] "This game we wanted to work on getting the ball inside more, but we may have rushed some shots. I know I rushed a few." [...] Despite this, Allmond led his team in scoring. On November 19, in what is sometimes considered Allmond's greatest performance, he scored 37 points in a road game against AP No. 4 Kentucky at Rupp Arena. He shot 11-of-16 from beyond the arc, the most three-pointers ever made at the arena and the most by a Southland or Sam Houston State player. Allmond said, [...] "I knew I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of open looks because of the fast pace they play." [...] The guard recorded 24 {{points in the first}} half alone, tying the opponent record of 8 threes at Rupp Arena, which was set by the Miami RedHawks' Nick Winbush three days prior. His shots included an off-balance three-pointer past John Wall and a corner trey over Patrick Patterson. However, the opposing Wildcats won the game, 102-92, behind 27 points and 18 rebounds from DeMarcus Cousins. The Bearkats toppled Auburn on December 20, as Allmond poured 25 points and 6 three-pointers. He also {{played a major role in}} Sam Houston State's 90-63 win over Lamar on January 27, 2010, scoring 24 points for his team, which was missing impact player Gilberto Clavell. Sam Houston State finished the season with a 25-8 overall record and went 14-2 in the conference. Strongly due to Allmond's scoring punch, the team ranked among the best in the Division I for assists. Head coach Bob Marlin praised him by saying, [...] "It's amazing some of the shots he has made. We feel he is one of the best shooters in the country. His outside shooting also opens up a lot for us inside as well." [...] He finished his senior year going [...]408 from beyond the arc, the second-highest three-point field goal percentage for a player in school history. He also finished fifth on the Bearkat's all-time three-pointer list, recording 270 in his two seasons playing Division I basketball. In addition, his 15.5 scoring average was the eight-highest for a Sam Houston State player.|$|E

I have the ideas, the collaborations in my mind - it's all locked up in my head. —Alexandra Burke Burke stated that her next album would get [...] "down, raunchy and dirty", promising the record would take risks. Burke took a break from recording so that she could embark on her first headline concert tour, the All Night Long Tour and said she would continue recording two days after the tour ends. She worked with RedOne for a lot of the album, but also reunited with Bruno Mars, StarGate, Rico Love, Autumn Rowe and Ne-Yo, among others. Burke stated that she had recorded a duet, with an [...] "amazing" [...] artist. She said, she was working in the studio with songwriter, Autumn Rowe, and met him through Rowe and the duet just sort of [...] "happened". Burke featured on Swizz Beatz new album, Haute Living on track [...] "Show Off". In June it was reported that Burke had signed a record deal with RCA Records and the album will be jointly handled by the Syco and RCA Records. The album will be released in the United States after she signed a £3 million record deal with Epic Records. It was thought that Burke's album would be released just under RCA; however, she said that the album would be jointly handled by RCA and SyCo. Burke said that she went to [...] "writing camp" [...] while she was in Los Angeles. She said that it is when lots of songwriters and music producers flew in to work with her. She also said that she wrote two or three songs a day for a couple of weeks. After writing camp, [...] "the elephant in the room" [...] was one of the phrases which she came up with, which a lot of Americans say, she explained: [...] "It's about not discussing something you know needs to be discussed whether it's in a relationship or with friends or family," [...] she said of the song. Burke got the idea of using the saying from when she was in writing camp with a lot of Americans.|$|E
