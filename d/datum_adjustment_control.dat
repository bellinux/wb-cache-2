40|$|This paper {{takes the}} {{electric}} off-road vehicle with separated driven axles as the research object. To solve the longitudinal dynamics driving control problems, vehicle dynamics model, and control strategies were studied {{and the corresponding}} simulation was carried out. An 8 -DOF vehicle dynamics model with separated driven axles was built. The driving control strategies on the typical roads were put forward. The recognition algorithm of the typical road surfaces based on the wheels’ slip rates was proposed. And the two control systems were designed including the pedal opening degree <b>adjustment</b> <b>control</b> system based on PI algorithm and the interaxle torque distribution control system based on sliding mode control algorithm. The driving control flow of the proposed vehicle combining the pedal <b>adjustment</b> <b>control</b> system with the interaxle torque distribution control system was developed.

Simulation {{results show that the}} proposed drive control strategies can adapt to different typical road surfaces, limit the slip rates of the driving wheels within the stable zone, and ensure the vehicle driving safely and stably in accordance with the driver's intention...|$|R
40|$|Two psychophysical {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} analyze the role of color attributes in simple tasks involving color matching and discrimination. In Experiment I observers made color matches using three different <b>adjustment</b> <b>control</b> methods. The {{results showed that the}} Lightness, Chroma, Hue (LCH) and the Lightness, redness/greenness, blueness/yellowness ({L, r/g, y/b}) <b>adjustment</b> <b>controls</b> elicited significantly better performance than the display RGB controls in terms of both accuracy and time, but were not significantly different from each other. Expert observers performed significantly better than naive observers in terms of accuracy. Experiment II was a replication and extension of Melgosa, et al. ’s experiment in which observers judged differences and similarities for color attributes in pairs of colored patches. At a 95 % confidence level, the results from judging difference were significantly better than those from judging similarity. Hue and Lightness were significantly more identifiable than Chroma, r/g, and y/b. For all observers, lightness differences were more easily detected for less chromatic pairs than for higher chromatic ones. With respect {{to the size of the}} color differences, it was found that larger hue differences were more easily identifiable than smaller ones. Experts could more readil...|$|R

40|$|Sea {{level has}} been {{observed}} since 1966 at Syowa Station, a Japanese Antarctic station located on East Ongul Island(39. 6 °E, 69. 0 °S). An almost continuous record has been obtained from 1981 to 2000 and analyzed to investigate long-term and seasonal changes of mean sea level. After correction of year-to-year variation of the datum, {{it is found that}} the annual mean sea level has been falling at a rate of 1. 2 cm/year. This rate is bigger than previous estimations calculated from shorter records of sea level without appropriate <b>datum</b> <b>adjustment,</b> and also bigger than that expected from geological evidence. Based on discussion {{of the reasons for the}} trend, it is suggested that glacial rebound can not be excluded as the cause. The present analysis based on a long record for about 20 years also provides the amplitude(2. 7 cm) and phase of the nodal tide with the period of 18. 6 years. Characteristics of the seasonal change for the first half of the record(1981 - 1989) are different from those for the second half(1990 - 2000), associated with replacement of the observing system in 1990. Comparing with seasonal changes at other Antarctic stations and considering the results of previous studies, it is concluded that the seasonal change observed in the second half is more reliable, and that it reaches its maximum in April and minimum in October with an estimated annual tidal range of about 14 cm...|$|R

In addition, the authors found sequential modulations of the numerical distance effect and an interaction of both effects.

40|$|Encountering a {{conflict}} triggers an <b>adjustment</b> of cognitive <b>control.</b> This <b>adjustment</b> of cognitive <b>control</b> can even affect subsequent performance. The {{purpose of the}} present study was to determine whether more conflict triggers more <b>adjustment</b> of cognitive <b>control</b> for subsequent performance. To this end, we focussed on the bivalency effect, that is, the <b>adjustment</b> of cognitive <b>control</b> following the conflict induced by bivalent stimuli (i. e., stimuli with relevant features for two tasks). In two experiments, we tested whether the amount of conflict triggered by bivalent stimuli affected the bivalency effect. Bivalent stimuli were either compatible (i. e., affording one response) or incompatible (i. e., affording two different responses). Thus, compatible bivalent stimuli involved a task conflict, whereas incompatible bivalent stimuli involved a task and a response conflict. The results showed that the bivalency effect was not affected by this manipulation. This indicates that more conflict does not trigger more <b>adjustment</b> of cognitive <b>control</b> for subsequent performance. Therefore, only the occurrence of conflict – not its amount – is determinant for cognitive contro...|$|R

This optical sight {{is similar to the}} PSO-1 4×24 sight used on the Russian SVD rifle and the Romanian I.O.R. LPS 4×6° TIP2 4×24 sight used on the PSL rifle.The ON-M76 elevation turret features bullet drop compensation (BDC) in 50 m increments for engaging point and area targets at ranges from 100 m up to 1,000 m. The BDC feature must be tuned at the factory for the particular ballistic trajectory of a particular combination of rifle and cartridge (the 7,9 M75 sniper ammunition) at a predefined air density. Inevitable BDC induced errors will occur if the environmental and meteorological circumstances deviate from the circumstances the BDC was calibrated for. Marksmen can be trained to compensate for these errors. Besides the BDC elevation or vertical <b>adjustment</b> <b>control</b> of the reticle, the windage or horizontal <b>adjustment</b> <b>control</b> of the reticle can also be easily dialed in by the user without having to remove turret caps etc.The reticle illumination of the ZRAK M76 4× 5°10’ is provided by (radioactive) tritium.
