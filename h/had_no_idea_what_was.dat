500|$|Completing his {{training}} in June 1941, Pilot Officer Waddy was posted to the North African theatre with No.250 (Fighter) Squadron RAF, operating P-40 Tomahawks and, later, Kittyhawks. He was befriended and mentored by the RAAF's top-scoring ace, Clive [...] "Killer" [...] Caldwell, who became godfather to Waddy's daughter. Waddy's first operational sortie was as Caldwell's wingman; {{he found the}} ensuing dogfight so fast and confusing that he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> happening and afterwards had to ask the more experienced pilot how things had gone. On 9December, he registered his first victory—in a Tomahawk {{that had previously been}} Caldwell's personal mount—when he shared in the destruction of a Messerschmitt Bf110 twin-engined fighter near El Adem.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} when describing Chi's character, Clamp member Satsuki Igarashi stated [...] "Lately we've {{been saying that}} the easiest to understand is Chii from 'Chobits.' Errors occur with computers. Things like 'Although it's fine to speak the instructions' and 'Please fix this problem here' might be spoken in a cute voice." [...] In addition, an explanation for Chobitss plot was given by Igarashi who stated: [...] "Back then, when our computer had problems all we would get were these inscrutable error messages. However, we <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> wrong because it wouldn't tell us any more". Clamp also describes Chobits as {{a variation of the}} [...] "boy living with mysterious girl" [...] genre. Chi's design as a personal computer resulted from Ohkawa's wish to increase the sense of [...] "emotional discomfort" [...] around becoming emotionally involved with something considered to be merely a lifeless machine.|$|E
500|$|Patrick's {{voice is}} {{provided}} by actor Bill Fagerbakke, who also does the voices of numerous other characters on SpongeBob SquarePants. While creating the show and writing its pilot episode in 1997, Hillenburg and Derek Drymon, the show's then-creative director, were also conducting auditions to find voices for the show's characters. Fagerbakke auditioned {{for the role of}} Patrick after Tom Kenny, SpongeBob's voice actor, had been cast. Fagerbakke said, [...] "Steve is such a lovely guy, and I had absolutely no feeling for the material whatsoever." [...] He described his experience in the audition, saying [...] "I was just going in for another audition, and I <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> in store there in terms of the remarkable visual wit and really the kind of endearing child-like humanity in the show. I couldn't pick that up from the audition material at all. I was just kind of perfunctorially trying to give the guy what he wanted." ...|$|E

500|$|Bill Fagerbakke voiced SpongeBob's best friend, a starfish named Patrick Star in the episode. He {{auditioned for}} the role after Kenny had been cast as SpongeBob. [...] Fagerbakke said, [...] "Steve is such a lovely guy, and I had {{absolutely}} no feeling for the material whatsoever." [...] He described his experience in the audition, saying [...] "I was just going in for another audition, and I <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> in store there {{in terms of the}} remarkable visual wit and really the kind of endearing child-like humanity in the show. I couldn't pick that up from the audition material at all. I was just kind of perfunctorially trying to give the guy what he wanted." [...] For the part of Squidward, Hillenburg originally had Mr. Lawrence in mind {{for the role}}. Lawrence worked with Hillenburg and Drymon before on Rocko's Modern Life, so while working on the episode, Hillenburg invited him to audition for all the characters. Drymon said, [...] "We were showing Doug the storyboard, and he started reading back to us in his Tony the Tiger/Gregory Peck voice. It was really funny, and we wound up having SpongeBob use a deep voice when he entered the Krusty Krab for the first time." [...] Hillenburg decided to give Lawrence the part of the series villain, Plankton, instead.|$|E
500|$|The Gunnerkrigg Court webcomic is told in {{a series}} of episodic {{chapters}} such that each, while forming part of the overall storyline, also functions individually as a stand-alone story arc."Each of the chapters individually is sort of a self-contained thing, so if you were to just read one of them it wouldn't be like you <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> going on." [...] The themes and topics of the chapters vary widely: as one reviewer describes, [...] "You are also not subjected to 400-plus pages of intricate plot movement. While there is an overall story arc, there are also lighter chapters that focus on unusual classes ... or small moments that build the main characters." [...] Each chapter begins with a title page and ends with one or more [...] "bonus pages," [...] which are not integral to the main storyline but often offer ancillary details about the world of Gunnerkrigg Court or about minor characters. [...] The chapters have varied in length from four pages to more than eighty. [...] Each page is drawn in traditional (A4; 210 × 297mm) page format and divided arbitrarily into frames. At the bottom of the most recent page is a link to a comments thread for that page, in which readers may comment on and discuss that day's comic.|$|E
500|$|Although the Nazis were {{suspicious}} of {{the chairman of the}} local Olympic organizing committee, Theodor Lewald, as he had a Jewish grandmother, they quickly saw the propaganda potential in hosting the Olympic Games. Lewald had intended to stage the Games on a shoestring budget; instead, the resources of the Reich were thrown behind the effort. As the Nazi hatred of the Jews manifested itself in persecution, there were calls to move the Olympics from Germany, or alternatively, to boycott the Games. As head of the Olympic movement in the US, Brundage received many letters and telegrams urging action. In 1933 and 1934, the IOC worked to assure that, consistent with Olympic ideals, the Games would be open to all, and {{that there would be no}} discrimination because of race or religion. IOC President Comte Henri de Baillet-Latour wrote to Brundage in 1933, [...] "I am not personally fond of jews [...] and of the jewish [...] influence, but I will not have them molested in no way [...] whatsoever." [...] According to historical writer Christopher Hilton in his account of the 1936 Games, [...] "Baillet-Latour, and the great and good around him, <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> coming, and if the [...] German delegates kept offering assurances, what else could they do but accept them?" [...] Baillet-Latour opposed boycotting the Games, as did Brundage (who had learned in 1933 that he was being considered for IOC membership).|$|E

She later said she had [...] "never really done a proper audition before", and added that [...] "I had such fun , that day actually {{made me want to}} pursue [...] more seriously." [...] Later that year she was cast in her first major film role as Jessica, a dogged student newspaper reporter, in [...] (2003). Although the film was panned by critics, making it was a learning experience for Nichols. She said, [...] "I was a sponge for the entire time I was in Atlanta [...] and freely admitted that I <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> going on. I had never done a big film before, I had never been the lead in a film before and any advice anyone wanted to give me, I was more than willing to take." [...] The following year, Nichols played a member of a high school debate team in the independent film Debating Robert Lee (2004) and had a two-episode role in the crime drama television series Line of Fire (2004), which was cancelled after 11 of 13 produced episodes were broadcast. By August 2004, she was cast in supporting roles in the horror films The Amityville Horror (2005) and The Woods (2006).|$|E
500|$|James Montgomery from MTV {{commented that}} [...] "Gaga {{has created a}} world that, while oppressive, also looks great." [...] In a {{separate}} piece Montgomery added that [...] "... she may have finally reached the point in her career where not even she can top herself." [...] Rolling Stones Daniel Kreps called the video a [...] "cinematic epic." [...] Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly, liked the video; however, he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> going on: [...] "I can’t wait to hear Lady Gaga explain her latest video, “Alejandro.” Mostly because after watching it (twice!), I have absolutely no clue what’s going on beyond the obvious." [...] Anthony Benigno from Daily News felt that [...] "the shock songstress' new music video [...] is chock full of bed-ridden S imagery that makes it look like the softcore answer to The Matrix. Randall Roberts from Los Angeles Times said [...] "the clip reinforces the notion that no one understands the convergence of image and music right now better than Gaga." [...] Jed Gottlieb from the Boston Herald said that [...] "The plot [...] is hard to decipher, but it’s clearly not a story that ends happily ever after." [...] Jen Dose from National Post commented [...] "Gaga’s new vid for 'Alejandro' certainly brings the crazy we’ve all come to expect from her. It’s like an 8+ minute homage to Madonna—with some gay Nazis thrown in for good measure". Amy Odell of New York said the video's outfits were not as [...] "intense" [...] as those of [...] "Bad Romance" [...] or [...] "Telephone." [...] Nate Jones of Time Magazine disliked the song, but felt the video [...] "looks fantastic... the self-conscious ballsiness of Gaga and director Steven Klein works here." [...] Jennifer Cady from E! liked the video, but {{did not think it}} was as good as Gaga's previous work. Julie Moult from Daily Mail said [...] ", no-one could accuse Lady Gaga of being the shy and retiring type." ...|$|E

2500|$|On February 20, 1971, NORAD at Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado {{was ready}} to {{broadcast}} a normal required weekly test of the Emergency Broadcast System. However, AT reported that the United States Air Force used the wrong tape for the test by accident, and initiated an Emergency Action Notification, normally issued by the Office of Civil Defense or the President. This prompted all stations in the Fort Wayne, Indiana, area by order of the FCC to operate under emergency procedures and feed the broadcast from WOWO through their radios.

By then, the Lower East Side was, in my mind and in the minds of my friends, the most mystical place in the world." [...] "I certainly didn’t think some guru was suddenly going to appear and save me. I was too cynical. Yet I was regularly reading versions of the Bhagavad-gita and the Upanishads. Ironically, one week before the gift shop at 26 Second Avenue changed into Srila Prabhupada's temple, I was standing in that very doorway with a Bhagavad-gita in my back pocket, waiting to meet a friend. Somehow we had chosen 26 Second Avenue as a meeting place. At that time, I <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> about to happen." ...|$|E

I kept having to make myself laugh and leave set and play with my friends in the hair and makeup room and just sort of try to view the day as though it was just an average taping day because the last thing those scenes needed from my character's perspective was that sense of gravity, that feeling of, 'This is so important.'

Reports are that {{at least two of the}} aforementioned names looked extremely uncomfortable leaving the meeting" [...] which suggests that Patterson may in fact have been in on the Screwjob. This is corroborated by a Pro Wrestling Torch article from November 15, 1997 by Wade Keller which states, [...] "However, a two-hour meeting was held on the second floor of the Montreal Marriott on Saturday night with McMahon, Jim Ross, Pat Patterson, Jim Cornette, and Michaels. Bret was wrestling that night in Detroit. There is some belief that at this meeting McMahon proposed the idea of the finish to whoever of that group wasn't already in on it.
