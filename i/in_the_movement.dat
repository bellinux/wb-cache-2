5|$|Back in New York {{after the}} tour, Berkman and Goldman tried to rekindle their {{intimate}} relationship, but each had lost {{passion for the}} other. Instead, Berkman was attracted {{to some of the}} younger women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement,</b> including a teenager named Becky Edelsohn.|$|E

5|$|The {{principal}} {{goal of the}} fat acceptance {{movement is}} to decrease discrimination against people who are overweight and obese.

50|$|<b>In</b> {{addition}} to <b>the</b> three trombones, a solo tenor trombone appears <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second <b>movement.</b> <b>The</b> choir, if used, only appears <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final <b>movement.</b> <b>The</b> strings, if used, only appear {{in their entirety}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final <b>movement,</b> with <b>the</b> cellos and basses also appearing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first <b>movement.</b>|$|R
50|$|The play {{consists}} of three movements, divided into numerous scenes: 7 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first <b>movement,</b> 20 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second <b>movement,</b> and 3 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third <b>movement.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Cairnes {{also adds}} some {{investigations}} {{as to the}} fluctuations [...] of value: “Hitherto I have examined the derivative laws of value [...] in so far only as they are exemplified <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> of [...] normal prices. It will be interesting now to consider whether it [...] is possible to discover <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> of market prices any [...] corresponding phenomena.|$|R
5|$|A Community of Witches {{is based}} on {{interviews}} with more than a hundred practicing Wiccans and Pagans, study of the pre-existing literature on the subject and a national survey of the Pagan community in the U.S. In her work, Berger interprets Wicca as a religion of late modernity, as opposed to postmodernity, and subsequently examines it using the theories of sociologists Anthony Giddens and James A. Beckford. Themes covered include Pagan conceptions of the self, the role of covens and the wider Pagan community, the place of children <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> and the increasing routinization of Wicca through the foundation of organised churches and clergy.|$|E
5|$|Around 1733 Bach {{transposed}} his Latin Magnificat to Dmajor (BWV243). Besides transposing, he also {{applied a}} few modifications: for instance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> that has Luke1:54 as text he replaced the trumpet as performer of the cantus firmus by two oboes. Around {{a decade later}} Bach prepared two Latin Magnificats by other composers for performance (BWV1082, BWV Anh. 30). Probably {{around the same time}} Bach performed BWV10 again.|$|E
5|$|By 1921, Tzara {{had become}} {{involved}} in conflicts with other figures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement,</b> whom he claimed had parted {{with the spirit of}} Dada. He was targeted by the Berlin-based Dadaists, in particular by Huelsenbeck and Serner, the former of whom was also involved in a conflict with Raoul Hausmann over leadership status. According to Richter, tensions between Breton and Tzara had surfaced in 1920, when Breton first made known his wish to do away with musical performances altogether and alleged that the Romanian was merely repeating himself. The Dada shows themselves were by then such common occurrences that audiences expected to be insulted by the performers.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{principal}} themes {{of the work is}} the Creation theme, appearing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first <b>movement</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bass <b>in</b> long notes, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fifth <b>movement</b> <b>in</b> three variations (altered), and finally <b>in</b> <b>the</b> seventh <b>movement,</b> over ten times.|$|R

50|$|A {{central point}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement's</b> {{dynamics}} and faith is the {{devotion to the}} Shrine, based on <b>the</b> first shrine <b>in</b> Schoenstatt where <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> started with a special devotion to Mary and {{of which there are}} dozens of replicas around the world.|$|R
5|$|Cornwallis was {{sensitive}} {{to the fact that}} Tipu was likely to deny the invading army access to local forage and provisions, so he made arrangements for a large supply of provisions and arranged for the use of elephants to assist <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> of the army's siege equipment. He also encouraged the Marathas and the Nizam to step up their advances to join his army as quickly as possible so that he could take advantage of their cavalry.|$|E
5|$|During {{the time}} when African Americans were barred from ordination, women began to receive greater {{opportunities}} for leadership. Women formed {{an important part of}} the Assemblies of God's constituency, many being Sunday School workers and evangelists, most prominent being Aimee Semple McPherson (who would later found the Foursquare Church). This made the issue of women's place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> important in the 1930s. It was also recognized that many congregations who could not afford male pastors relied on women preachers. Despite the fact that opposition to female pastors had been regularly affirmed since 1914, the office of pastor was opened to women in 1935.|$|E
5|$|Even after renouncing his {{personal}} use of guns, King had a complex {{relationship with the}} phenomenon of self-defense <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement.</b> He publicly discouraged it as a widespread practice, but acknowledged that it was sometimes necessary. Throughout his career King was frequently protected by other civil rights activists who carried arms, such as Colonel Stone Johnson, Robert Hayling, and the Deacons for Defense and Justice.|$|E

5|$|In December 1946, the {{government}} of Camille Huysmans inaugurated a medal to be awarded to {{former members of the}} resistance and bestowed various other benefits on other members, including pensions and a scheme of state-funded apprenticeships. Individuals were accorded military rank equivalent to their status <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> during the war, entitling them to title and other privileges. Today the role of the resistance during the conflict is commemorated by memorials, plaques and road names across the country, {{as well as by the}} National Museum of the Resistance in Anderlecht.|$|E
5|$|Kruger was {{appointed}} Vice-President in March 1877, {{shortly before the}} South African Republic was annexed by Britain as the Transvaal. Over {{the next three years}} he headed two deputations to London to try to have this overturned and became the leading figure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> to restore the South African Republic's independence, culminating in the Boers' victory in the First Boer War of 1880–81. Kruger served until 1883 as a member of an executive triumvirate, then was elected President. In 1884 he headed a third deputation that brokered the London Convention, under which Britain recognised the South African Republic as a fully independent state.|$|E
5|$|Massachusetts was {{an early}} center of the Transcendentalist movement, which {{emphasized}} intuition, emotion, human individuality and a deeper connection with nature. Ralph Waldo Emerson, {{who was born in}} Boston but spent much of his later life in Concord, largely created the philosophy with his 1836 work Nature, and continued to be a key figure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> for the remainder of his life. Emerson's friend, Henry David Thoreau, who was also involved in Transcendentalism, recorded his year spent alone in a small cabin at nearby Walden Pond in the 1854 work Walden; or, Life in the Woods.|$|E

5|$|Several {{organisms are}} capable of rolling locomotion; however, true wheels and propellers—despite their utility in human vehicles—do not appear to play a {{significant}} role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> of living things (with the exception of certain flagella, which function like corkscrews). Biologists have expounded on the reasons for this apparent absence of biological wheels, and wheeled creatures have appeared often in speculative fiction.|$|E
5|$|The Assemblies of God has {{roots in}} the Pentecostal revival in the early 20th century. The Pentecostal aspects of the revival were not {{generally}} welcomed by the established churches, and participants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> soon found themselves outside existing religious bodies. They were forced to seek their own places of worship, and soon {{there were hundreds of}} distinctly Pentecostal congregations.|$|E
5|$|The best-known figure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> was Grégoire Kayibanda. Like {{most of the}} Hutu counter-elite Kayibanda {{had trained}} for the priesthood at the Nyakibanda seminary, {{although}} he was not ordained. After completing his education in 1948, he became a primary-school teacher. In 1952 Kayibanda succeeded Alexis Kagame {{as editor of the}} Catholic magazine, L'Ami. During the late 1950s he was a Travail, Fidélité, Progrès (TRAFIPRO) food-cooperative board member, edited the pro-Hutu Catholic magazine Kinyamateka, and founded the Mouvement Social Muhutu (MSM).|$|E
5000|$|As Alfred Dürr and Gardiner observed, {{the text}} {{as well as the}} chorale melody is present <b>in</b> all <b>movements.</b> <b>The</b> cantata is {{constructed}} <b>in</b> symmetry: <b>the</b> soprano carries <b>the</b> melody <b>in</b> <b>the</b> outer <b>movements,</b> <b>in</b> movement 2 it is sung by <b>the</b> alto, and <b>in</b> <b>movement</b> 4 played by <b>the</b> trumpet. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> central <b>movement,</b> <b>the</b> beginning of both the vocal and the instrumental theme are derived from it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> most intimate setting of the work. <b>The</b> melody <b>in</b> bar form has a [...] of unusual five measures and reaches a climax {{at the beginning of the}} , which Bach also stresses in a variety of means <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movements.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{interaction}} between Japanese and European art has been significant: for example ukiyo-e prints, which {{began to be}} exported in the 19th century <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> known as Japonism, had a significant influence {{on the development of}} modern art in the West, most notably on post-Impressionism. Famous ukiyo-e artists include Hokusai and Hiroshige. Hokusai coined the term manga. Japanese comics now known as manga developed in the 20th century and have become popular worldwide. Japanese animation is called anime. Japanese-made video game consoles have been popular since the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The long orchestral prelude (166 bars) is in E minor and, in {{the manner}} of an operatic overture, anticipates several of the themes which will be heard later <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement.</b> The {{exposition}} begins in near-silence; the scene depicted is that of a rocky, wooded mountainside, the dwelling place of anchorites whose utterances are heard in an atmospheric chorus complete with whispers and echoes.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{occasional}} tension between those musicians {{who went into}} exile, and were therefore able to perform for, and raise awareness among, much larger audiences, and anti-apartheid musicians who remained in South Africa. The latter group has received significantly less popular attention, though Vershbow states that it played an equally important role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement,</b> and Schumann argues that it was responsible for putting significant pressure on the apartheid government. The role of music in social change in South African is examined in the documentary film , released in 2002. The film focuses specifically on the 'liberation music' of the struggle against white domination.|$|E
