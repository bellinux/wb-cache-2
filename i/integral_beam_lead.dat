40|$|The {{assembly}} of superconducting millimeter and submillimeter-wave circuits often requires RF ground connections. These are usually made by soldering, wire bonding, conductive adhesive or conductive wire gaskets. The difficulty of assembly increases with frequency as chip {{dimensions and tolerances}} shrink. The assembly issues, and also the throughput requirements of large radio astronomy projects such as ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter Array), suggest the need of a <b>beam</b> <b>lead</b> technology for these circuits. <b>Beam</b> <b>lead</b> processes are already established for silicon and gallium arsenide wafers. However, niobium circuits on quartz substrates present unique difficulties. SIS junctions introduce additional thermal and chemical constraints to process development. For quartz, wet etches are isotropic and dry etches with high etch rates require large ion energies. Therefore, {{it is difficult to}} develop a conventional process in which gold pads on the substrate surface are formed into <b>beam</b> <b>leads</b> by a backside etch. Instead we have developed a topside process in which, after the mixer circuits are completed, dicing cuts are made at the finished chip dimensions but only partly through the wafer. The dicing cuts are then filled with a sacrificial material in a non-CMP process, and planarized. Gold plated pads are then defined, overhanging the planarized cuts. The sacrificial material is then removed from these cuts, leaving the gold <b>beam</b> <b>leads.</b> The wafer is then backside lapped into the cuts to the desired thickness, separating the individual chips. We discuss the new planarization scheme developed for this <b>beam</b> <b>lead</b> process and compare a variety of sacrificial materials.

40|$|We {{present a}} process for {{fabricating}} ultra-thin silicon chips for submillimeter-wave mixing applications using SOI (Silicon On Insulator) wafers. Such chips allow {{the profile of the}} mixer substrate to be minimized within the microstrip channel, thereby simplifying RF design considerations and minimizing machining constraints. The chips feature gold <b>beam</b> <b>leads,</b> RF filter structures, and hot-electron bolometers as the non-linear element. We designed a prototype receiver to demonstrate the feasibility of the ultra-thin silicon chip technology. The receiver has a center frequency of 585 GHz and accommodates both diffusion-cooled and phonon-cooled hot-electron bolometer mixers fabricated atop an ultra-thin silicon chip. The chip fits within the microstrip channel of a split-block horn antenna. Protruding from the sides and ends of the silicon chip are thick gold <b>beam</b> <b>leads,</b> which provide electrical and thermal contact between the chip and the waveguide block. In addition, the <b>beam</b> <b>leads</b> provide mechanical support to the chip, allowing the chip to be suspended within the middle of the microstrip channel between the two block halves. Ultra-thin silicon chips with <b>beam</b> <b>leads</b> will facilitate the construction of large format spectroscopic imaging arrays. Such arrays would contain an assembly of individual chips, each featuring a single nonlinear mixing element. The chips could be added, removed of replaced without disturbing the rest of the elements within the array. There are myriad potentials for such systems; examples include atmospheric research, astrophysics, and security systems...|$|R
50|$|Compliant bonding transmits {{heat and}} {{pressure}} through a compliant or indentable aluminum tape and therefore is applicable in bonding gold wires and the <b>beam</b> <b>leads</b> {{that have been}} electroformed to the silicon integrated circuit (known as the beam leaded integrated circuit).|$|R
5000|$|An {{important}} {{application for}} compliant bonding {{arose in the}} early 1960s, when techniques were developed for fabricating a “beam leaded silicon integrated circuit “chip” consisting of pre-attached electroformed 0.005-inch thick gold leads or “beams” extending from the silicon chip (Figure 5). Thus the beam leaded “chip” eliminated the need to thermosonically bond wires directly onto metallized pads of the fragile silicon chip (as shown in Figure 6) The extended ends of the electroformed beams could then be permanently solid-state bonded to a matching metallized sunburst circuit which has been pre-deposted on a ceramic substrate appropriately packaged in a computer in the making. Figure 7. shows a preshaped hard faced tool thermocompression bonding all of the <b>beam</b> <b>leads</b> of a chip in one bonding cycle. In order to avoid excessively deforming the fine <b>beam</b> <b>leads</b> with the hard bonding tool and putting them at risk of mechanical failure, the applied bonding forces have to be carefully monitored.The invention of compliant bonding eliminated {{the problems associated with}} a hard faced bonding tool and therefore was ideally suited to simultaneously bond all of the extended electroplated gold <b>beam</b> <b>leads</b> to a matching gold metallized sunburst patterned ceramic substrate packaged in a computer (Figure 8). For example, compliant bonding eliminated the problems of using a hard faced bonding tool such as: attempting to uniformly deform the nominally 0.005-inch thick <b>beams</b> <b>leads</b> having slight variations in their thickness; excessive lead deformation that could cause mechanical damage and an ultimate [...] "costly" [...] failure of these fine beam leaded silicon chips which are the [...] "brains" [...] of our computers. The compliant bonding tape media offered the additional advantage of carrying the [...] "beam leaded silicon chip" [...] to the bonding site thus facilitating production. Figures 9. and 10 show that the compliant tape offers the advantage of carrying the beam leaded chip to the bonding site as discussed above. Figure 11 shows a beam leaded silicon integrated circuit compliantly bonded to a gold metallized sunburst pattern deposited on an alumina ceramic substrate which will be encapsulated and packaged in a computer-type device. Figure 12 shows the spent compliant member used to bond the chip in Figure 11 which clearly shows a mirror image of the uniformly bonded <b>beam</b> <b>leads.</b>|$|R
