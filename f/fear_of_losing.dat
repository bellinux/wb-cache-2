40|$|Contrary to the {{experiences}} of other countries, perceptions of job insecurity in Russia {{were not correlated with}} the rates of unemployment and the business cycle over the last decade. We develop the theoretical framework that predicts that the individual perceptions of job insecurity depend on regional unemployment rates and on the within-group variance of wage distribution faced by workers. We test this hypothesis using data from ten panel rounds of Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey. Our results indicate that while higher rates of unemployment make workers feel less job secure, the wage compression during recessions reduces their <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> a job. In periods of economic expansion the effect of lower unemployment rates is offset by the higher <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> better paying jobs...|$|R
50|$|Lucien Leuwen is {{the second}} major novel written by French author Stendhal in 1834, {{following}} The Red and the Black (1830). It remained unfinished due to the political culture of the July Monarchy in the 1830s and Stendhal's <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> his government position by offending the administration. It was published posthumously in 1894.|$|R
5|$|In France, Navy Minister Truguet {{attempted}} to enrol Surcouf in the Navy as an auxiliary officer, which he declined. Hennequin states that Bonaparte himself offered him {{the rank of}} Captain and the command of two frigates, which Surcouf declined for <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> his freedom of action, and awarded him a Sabre of honour. Surcouf was awarded the Legion of Honour at {{the founding of the}} Order, on 19 May 1802.|$|E
5|$|Jacob L. Beilhart (March 4, 1867 – November 24, 1908) was {{the founder}} and leader of a communitarian group known as the Spirit Fruit Society. Beilhart {{believed}} that jealousy, materialism, and the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> another's love were {{at the root of}} much of the illness in the world. Under his direction, the Spirit Fruit Society sought to model and practice those beliefs.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} after the murders, the Ministry of Interior {{announced}} its deliberation about making the gun license registry accessible to psychiatrists in order to give them the ability to report to police possible changes of mental state of their patients having an impact on their eligibility to possess firearms. This was, however, rejected by psychiatric associations. They argued that psychiatrists' main goal is to cure patients, and that potential patients {{may be more likely to}} avoid psychiatric treatment for <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> their gun license.|$|E
25|$|Companies {{that have}} cornered their markets have usually {{done so in}} an attempt to gain greater leeway in their decisions; for example, they may desire to charge higher prices for their {{products}} without <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> too much business. The cornerer hopes to gain control of enough of the supply of the commodity to be able to set the price for it.|$|R
50|$|However, {{after the}} office had been vacant {{for more than}} three months, the Labour MP James Hoy raised the issue at Prime Minister's Questions on 31 July, {{suggesting}} that the delay was due to government <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> a by-election. (At the 1959 election, Grant had a majority of only 2,084 in his Woodside constituency, down from 4,303 in 1955. Woodside was by then considered a marginal seat.).|$|R
30|$|Using Russian {{household}} {{survey data}} (RLMS) for 1994 - 2009, we detect that the Russians {{tend to have}} very articulated <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> their jobs and not finding new ones of comparable worth. Our comparisons show that such fear indexes are much {{higher than in the}} OECD countries and are close to that is observed in Latin American countries with weak social protection systems. This indicates that Russian workers perceive the actual state of job security as weak.|$|R
5|$|After {{six years}} with no buyers, in late 1986 Northrop {{canceled}} the $1.2billion project. Northrop {{was reluctant to}} protest perceived favoritism of the F-16 in <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> support for the project for the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit stealth bomber. Ongoing negotiations with the Royal Moroccan Air Force for 20 F-20s were canceled; along with the small order by Bahrain. Later on, a bribery scandal would emerge from the attempts to market the F-20 to South Korea, leading to several Northrop managers resigning and the reprimanding of chief executive Thomas V. Jones, who retired in 1989.|$|E

The first thing she asks him after the crash is the whereabouts of the diamonds, and avoids answering Paulo when he asks if they would still be together if she did not need him to help find the diamonds. Paulo does what Nikki tells him to because of his <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> her, which results in their deaths.|$|E
5|$|Other {{stories for}} the {{character}} include blackmail, one-night stands, heavy drinking and robberies. In 2011, the programme's series producer Stuart Blackburn devised a storyline to help viewers relate to Amy more. It began when Amy discovers she is pregnant by the serial's villain Cain Dingle. As the narrative progresses, Amy becomes ostracised as the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> her new-found family increases. Amy has received mixed reviews from critics. Jane Simon from the Daily Mail said her first scenes resembled a horror movie, while her colleague Jaci Stephen has opined that Amy wears too much make-up. However, entertainment website Digital Spy has favoured many of her storylines. Halfpenny has been nominated for three Best Newcomer awards for her portrayal of Amy. Halfpenny announced her departure from Emmerdale in October 2013. She departed on 14 November 2013.|$|E
50|$|President Hipólito Yrigoyen {{finished}} his {{term of office}} in 1922 with a prosperous economy, soaring popularity and content with leaving the Casa Rosada with his Ambassador to France, Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear. The scion of one of Argentina's traditional landed families, the well-mannered Alvear placated Yrigoyen's <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> control over the Radical Civic Union, a risk he insured himself against by placing his personal friend and former Buenos Aires Police Chief, Elpidio González, as Alvear's Vice-President.|$|R
50|$|Science is broadly {{understood}} as collecting, analyzing, publishing, reanalyzing, critiquing, and reusing data. Proponents of open science identify {{a number of}} barriers that impede or dissuade the broad dissemination of scientific data.These include financial paywalls of for-profit research publishers, restrictions on usage applied by publishers of data, poor formatting of data or use of proprietary software {{that makes it difficult}} to re-purpose, and cultural reluctance to publish data for <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> control <b>of</b> how the information is used.|$|R

5|$|Early in the 1891 season, both Crosby and John A. Hartwell, {{the other}} {{starting}} end, who later followed Crosby as Navy football coach, {{were injured in}} a game. While observing a team practice, Hartwell and Crosby noticed the play of backup end Frank Hinkey. After watching Hinkey for a time, Hartwell {{decided to return to}} practicing for <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> his starting position; Crosby did not consider this necessary. By the next game, Hinkey had replaced Crosby as the starting end and he did not regain the position. The team finished the season with a perfect record and would be retrospectively named national champions. Crosby remained popular through his senior year at the university, {{and he was one of}} three graduates presented with a class award. Upon graduation from the school, Crosby enrolled in New York Law School and joined a law office in New York City.|$|E
5|$|Family {{issues were}} {{significant}} concerns for lesbians when gay activism became more vocal in the 1960s and 1970s. Custody issues in particular were of interest since often courts would not award custody to mothers who were openly homosexual, {{even though the}} general procedure acknowledged children were awarded to the biological mother. Several studies performed {{as a result of}} custody disputes viewed how children grow up with same-sex parents compared to single mothers who did not identify as lesbians. They found that children's mental health, happiness, and overall adjustment is similar to children of divorced women who are not lesbians. Sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex roles of children who grow up with lesbian mothers are unaffected. Differences that were found include the fact that divorced lesbians tend to be living with a partner, fathers visit divorced lesbian mothers more often than divorced nonlesbian mothers, and lesbian mothers report a greater <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> their children through legal means.|$|E
5|$|The backstory {{presented}} in StarCrafts manual {{and in the}} novel Shadow Hunters also shows {{the rise of a}} second society of Protoss known as the Nerazim. They are a sizeable minority of the Protoss who reject the Khala out of <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> their individuality inside the psychic link. The Nerazim are treated as heretics by the Khalai Protoss and are forcibly evicted from Aiur. Despite their persecution, the majority of Dark Templar do not hold anything against their estranged brethren, seeking to defend Aiur in any way they can. The Nerazim are presented as nomadic, liberal society, only settling on the planet Shakuras to study a Xel'Naga temple there. During the Brood War event, the Protoss lose their homeworld of Aiur to the Zerg (even with the Overmind being destroyed by Tassadar) and the Khalai Protoss are forced to escape and seek refuge on Shakuras, by then the homeworld of the Nerazim Protoss. After the conclusion of StarCraft, the two groups begin to reconcile, but the reconciliation is marred by mutual distrust.|$|E
5000|$|In addition, {{upon hearing}} Bob Dylan's [...] "Blowin' in the Wind" [...] in 1963, Cooke was greatly moved {{that such a}} poignant song about racism in America could come from someone who was not black, and was also ashamed {{he had not yet}} written {{something}} like that himself. However, his image and <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> his largely white fan base prevented him from doing so. Cooke loved the song so much it was immediately incorporated into his repertoire.|$|R
5000|$|Technophiles {{may view}} technology's {{interaction}} with society as creating an utopia, cyber or otherwise, {{and a strong}} indescribable futuristic feeling. [...] "In the utopian stories, technologies are seen as natural societal developments, improvements to daily life, or as forces that will transform reality for the better. Dystopian reactions emphasize <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> control, becoming dependent, and being unable to stop change". Both utopian and dystopian streams are weaved in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World (1932) and George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949).|$|R

5|$|The siege cost 20,000 Ottoman {{casualties}} and over 1,000 Albanian casualties. Marin Barleti claims that Murad died of disease under the fortress of Krujë, but Murad in fact died in Edirne in 1451. Murad began {{to retire from}} Albania out of <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> even more men from the Albanian winter, however the retreat itself caused the loss of thousands of Ottoman troops due to attacks from local Albanian militias. Skanderbeg {{was at the end}} of his resources. He travelled to Ragusa, urging for assistance, and the Ragusans informed Pope Nicholas V. Through financial assistance, Skanderbeg managed to hold Krujë and regain much of his territory. Skanderbeg's success brought praise from all over Europe and ambassadors were sent to him from Rome, Naples, Hungary, and Burgundy. Skanderbeg then became a vassal of Alfonso V, on March 26, 1451, by the Treaty of Gaeta, gaining much needed men and supplies from the crown of Aragon.|$|E

30|$|In {{spite of}} the {{widespread}} media coverage of Jespersen—and the widespread discussion of the case among lawyers and legal academics—the authors found that Las Vegas casino workers, who stood to gain the most from the decision, were completely unaware of it. And when the authors made them aware of the favorable legal decision, the casino workers expressed unwillingness {{to come forward and}} enforce their newfound rights. Among the excuses the workers gave included <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> their current hard-to-get, high-paying jobs and of being blacklisted from similar, future jobs (George et al. 2011).|$|R
