40|$|Chronic i. v. {{administration}} of a competitive antagonist of arginine-vasopressin (AVP), d(CH 2) 5 -D-Tyr(Et) -VAVP, in Sprague-Dawley rats induced only a transient diabetes insipidus (<b>DI)</b> -like state. <b>Water</b> excretion and intake were markedly increased {{on the first}} day of administration but subsequently reverted to normal. A similar response to the antagonist was observed upon continuous i. v. infusion in Brattleboro rats, homozygous for hereditary hypothalamic DI, which had been substituted with exogenous AVP. This excludes the possibility that increased secretion of endogenous AVP had overcome the blocking effect of the competitive antagonist in Sprague-Dawley rats. However, when AVP was withdrawn from chronically AVP-treated <b>DI</b> rats, <b>water</b> intake increased to values higher than those observed after the antagonist. Subsequently, water intake also decreased but remained elevated compared to that of AVP-substituted rats receiving the antagonist. This suggests that the antagonist might have AVP-like agonistic properties that limit its efficacy and allow compensatory mechanisms to restore normal water balance despite continuous blockade of AVP receptors. The agonistic properties of d(CH 2) 5 -D-Tyr(Et) VAVP were verified upon chronic i. v. administration in nonpretreated DI rats. Thus, the normalization of water balance in Sprague-Dawley rats chronically receiving d(CH 2) 5 -D-Tyr(Et) VAVP is probably due to the activation of compensatory mechanisms and to the agonistic effects of d(CH 2) 5 -D-Tyr(Et) VAVP...|$|R

50|$|Deionized water (<b>DI</b> <b>water,</b> DIW or {{de-ionized}} water), often {{synonymous with}} demineralized water / DM water, is water {{that has had}} almost all of its mineral ions removed, such as cations like sodium, calcium, iron, and copper, and anions such as chloride and sulfate. Deionization is a chemical process that uses specially manufactured ion-exchange resins, which exchange hydrogen and hydroxide ions for dissolved minerals, and then recombine to form water. Because most non-particulate water impurities are dissolved salts, deionization produces highly pure water that is generally similar to distilled water, with the advantage that the process is quicker and does not build up scale. However, deionization does not significantly remove uncharged organic molecules, viruses or bacteria, except by incidental trapping in the resin. Specially made strong base anion resins can remove Gram-negative bacteria. Deionization can be done continuously and inexpensively using electrodeionization.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{process for}} synthesizing [...] {{nanotubes}} is through anodization in an electrolytic solution. When anodized in a 0.5 weight percent HF solution for 20 minutes, well-aligned titanium oxide nanotube arrays can be fabricated {{with an average}} tube diameter of 60 nm and length of 250 nm. Based on X-ray Diffraction, nanotubes grown through anodization are amorphous.As HF is highly corrosive and harmful chemical, NH4F is now being used as the etching agent in lieu of HF. In a typical synthesis process, a formamide based non aqueous electrolyte is produced containing 0.2M NH4F and 5 vol% of <b>DI</b> <b>water.</b> The anodization process is carried out under 25V at 20oC for 20 hours, in a two electrode electrochemical cell consisting of a highly pure and thoroughly cleaned titanium plate as the anode, a copper plate or platinum wire as the cathode and the aforesaid electrolyte. The as prepared sample is annealed in air at 400oC to get anatase phase.Hollow TiO2 nanofibers can be also prepared by coating carbon nanofibers with titanium(IV) butoxide (Ti(OCH2CH2CH2CH3)4). The product is then heated at 550 °C for several hours in air to remove the carbon core and form TiO2 nanocrystals. When chiral carbon nanofibers are used as templates, the resulting TiO2 fibers are also chiral, i.e., they respond differently to left and right-hand circularly polarized light. Such optical activity is common for organic, but not for inorganic molecules or nanostructures; the latter are preferred for optical applications because of their superior mechanical and thermal stability.|$|E
