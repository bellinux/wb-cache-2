50|$|The <b>feed</b> <b>grinder</b> {{introduced}} {{another method}} of grinding grain. Whereas the particular dress of the millstones limits what substance can be ground, the <b>feed</b> <b>grinder</b> {{was capable of}} grinding a variety of grains and seeds. This machine was mostly used to mix feed for the local farmers' animals. Today the <b>feed</b> <b>grinder</b> is used to grind corn, which the mill sells as duck chow.|$|E
5000|$|Later, after incorporation, the New Holland Machine Company sold these feed {{grinders}} {{with the}} option of being mounted on a wooden or steel truck and also with {{the option of}} {{having one of the}} four larger New Holland engines (4 hp through the 16 hp models) mounted on the truck together with the <b>feed</b> <b>grinder.</b> [...] In this way the <b>feed</b> <b>grinder</b> and engine would form a single unit which could easily be moved around the farm.|$|E
5000|$|As {{early as}} November 1899, {{even before the}} company had been incorporated, Abe Zimmerman's {{blacksmith}} shop had been advertising a <b>feed</b> <b>grinder</b> of his own design. This [...] "feed and cob mill" [...] had a capacity of 10 to 30 bushels of feed per hour and was being offered to the farming public for $15.00.|$|E
50|$|Along {{with the}} {{prominent}} tractor division, IH also sold several {{different types of}} farm-related equipment, such as balers, cultivators, combines (self-propelled and pull behind), combine heads, corn shellers, cotton pickers, manure spreaders, hay rakes, crop dusters, disk harrows, elevators, <b>feed</b> <b>grinders,</b> hammer mills, hay conditioners, milking machines, planters, mills, discs, plows, and miscellaneous equipment.|$|R
40|$|The {{entry of}} the United States into World War II {{augmented}} {{the necessity of}} utilizing agriculture 2 Ì† 7 s resources to the fullest extent in meeting increased food demands with reduced supplies of labor. One of the principal means of expanding production under such conditions is by fuller use of available farm machinery. Unfortunately, however, when a state of national emergency was declared in May, 1941, little was known either about the utilization of Iowa farm machinery or about the numbers of various types of machines available on the farms. To provide the needed information a survey was conducted in August and September of 1941 {{with the cooperation of}} the Work Projects Administration and the Agricultural Marketing Service. Information was collected in August from 2, 911 farms regarding corn planters, grain binders, grain drills, double disks, single disks, hay loaders, manure spreaders, mowers, plows, rakes, rollers, seeders, spike harrows and spring tooth harrows. The September survey obtained information from 3, 012 farms on. cornpickers, combines, ensilage cutters, grain elevators, corn shellers, <b>feed</b> <b>grinders,</b> milking machines, tractors, trucks, trailers and wagons 2 (table 1) ...|$|R
40|$|Citation: Maelzer, V. The test of an {{improved}} jumbo windmill. Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1897. Introduction: The use of wind {{as a prime}} mover is a very ancient method of obtaining power. The large four vaned windmill of Holland has been embodied in literature just as the high majestic overshot waterwheel. Both are quite old. But age {{is not always a}} sign of development. Windmill construction has received quite an impetus {{in the last few years}} because of the increased demand for the utilization of wind power in the growing field of irrigation. Hence we see constant efforts being made to improve in order to get the greatest amount of power for the wind velocity and the size of the wheel. Here in Kansas the windmill is of special importance because, in the first place, we have the wind, and in the second place we have much need of just such a power for pumping water for stock and for irrigation purposes, for running <b>feed</b> <b>grinders,</b> etc. To meet this demand for improvement the resulting forms of wind motors have been numerous and the variety extends over a wide range. Even so much so that the uninitiated traveler in the sunflower state would not recognize many of the contrivances as belonging to the genus windmill. Probably the principal reason for the apparent success of all the types of wind engine is the difficulty of making a practical test of their relative merits...|$|R
50|$|It is {{regional}} trade point and market place for Farming Tools and Agricultural equipments like Cultivator, Harrow, Plough,Spading machine, Air seeder, Transplanter, Pump Unit, Trailer, Stationary Engine, Portable engine, Traction engine, Agricultural Engine, Ploughing Engine, <b>Feed</b> <b>grinder,</b> Cutter etc.. It {{is also known}} for scrap and waste collection and management consisting of recyclable materials left over from product manufacturing and consumption, such as parts of vehicles, building supplies, and surplus materials. Unlike waste, scrap can have significant monetary value.|$|E
50|$|The {{turbines}} are {{the most}} important pieces of machinery as they supply power to all the other equipment in the mill. They are the originals, cast in 1859 in the Victoria Foundry in Ottawa. The larger turbines can generate 40-horse power and the smaller one makes 20-horse power. The turbines could operate all year, because the constant flow of water through the flume never froze. The first turbine drives the <b>feed</b> <b>grinder</b> and bolter, the third drives the elevators and auger, and the fifth drives the millstones and the seed cleaner. The other three are no longer in use.|$|E
50|$|John P. Gilson and {{his brother}} Michael Gilson were {{descendants}} of Theodore Gilson, who had emigrated to the United States from Colmar-Berg, Luxembourg and, in 1850, started what eventually became the Gilson Manufacturing Company. Brothers John and Michael, having both worked for that company, started the Gilson Brothers Company in 1911. At that time, the Gilson Brothers' main products were limestone <b>grinders,</b> <b>feed</b> cutters, and concrete mixers.|$|R
5000|$|The most {{important}} factor on a jig grinder is the dual-spindle configuration. The main spindle is roughly positioned with between 1" [...] or 2" [...] of travel for setup, and then the [...]100" [...] of outfeed is used during machine operation to outfeed into the work. A spacer bar may be used between the grinder and main spindle, allowing large (9" [...] radius or larger) work to be completed. The main spindle has {{a wide range of}} speeds to ensure proper <b>grinder</b> <b>feed</b> rates are maintained.|$|R
5000|$|In Fright Xmas, Alan-Bertaneisson Jones {{stated that}} the plot of Black Christmas did not focus on the killer but rather on Jess and the other girls from the film, saying that [...] "This is quite refreshing, because unlike in later movies where the victims (especially the female ones) are just a line of meat to <b>feed</b> to the <b>grinder,</b> in this film Jessica {{is a much more}} fully {{realized}} character; a character with great courage, intelligence and strength (more akin to Laurie from Halloween, Ripley from the Alien movies or Sidney from the Scream movies than most female victims of slashers, perhaps especially in the 1980s)." ...|$|R
