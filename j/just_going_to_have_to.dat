500|$|Canavan has {{suffered}} from asthma {{since he was a}} child, and has battled throughout his career to control the ailment. He told the Asthma Society of Ireland, [...] "I thought to myself, this is something that I am <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> put up with." [...] In later years, however, improved medication has afforded Canavan what he described as, [...] "a better quality of life".|$|E
500|$|Hamlin, who led {{the most}} laps, {{described}} his frustration: [...] "The strategy and what-not at the end just didn't work our way. That's all I can ask for, {{is to have the}} better car than those two guys – and we did. But, unfortunately, the strategy bit us. We're <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go there and do it the old-fashioned way next week and try to beat them on the race track." [...] Afterward, Newman, who finished second, commented, [...] "We were saving fuel the whole time. Made more sense to save fuel. We were two laps short. We just did what I thought we needed to do. If Carl made it, Carl made it." [...] Fifth place finisher Johnson described his happiness by saying: [...] "We're going to go home and we're going to make sure we have the best engines, go through our simulation stuff, make sure our car is as fast as it can be and then race. We were in a good situation and could take the risk, take the chance. It worked out for us.|$|E
500|$|Cosmopolitan {{journalist}} Alex Rees noted how it {{was normal}} for the singer to sound [...] "breathy" [...] and [...] "breathless" [...] following four songs in a row on the album discussing sex. Nicole James of Fuse called the song a [...] "sexed-up midtempo banger". Jem Aswad of the same publication noted {{the presence of a}} [...] "wild, jazzy, Joni-ish melody that flies all over the scale". Jordan Runtagh from the website VH1 called [...] "No Angel" [...] a [...] "classic fake-out love song" [...] and connected to the singer's real-life relationship with husband Jay-Z. A more mixed review came from Ryan E.C. Hamm from Under the Radar who noted that the experimentalistic songs on Beyoncé which do not work well, managed to look better only because of the record itself; he examplified this with [...] "No Angel", criticizing it as [...] "a little boring". Both Christopher R. Weingarten of Spin and Tom Breihan of Stereogum called the song [...] "boring"; the latter added it would be that way for listeners [...] "until that subtle digital bassline finds its way into your head". Breihan, however, praised the singer's falsetto vocals as [...] "a thing to behold". Melissa Locker of Time magazine stated that the singer sang [...] "slightly obnoxiously" [...] in [...] "No Angel". Una Mullally from The Irish Times questioned how [...] "No Angel" [...] was included in the track listing of Beyoncé, before adding [...] "but it did and we're <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> deal with it". However, she concluded that the song should be listened several more times to be understood.|$|E

2500|$|Mattis {{believes}} that Iran {{is the principal}} threat to {{the stability of the}} Middle East, ahead of Al-Qaeda and ISIS. Mattis says: [...] "I consider ISIS nothing more than an excuse for Iran to continue its mischief. Iran is not an enemy of ISIS. They have a lot to gain from the turmoil in the region that ISIS creates." [...] On the Iran nuclear deal, although he sees it as a poor agreement, he believes there is now no way to tear it up, saying: [...] "We are <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> recognize that we have an imperfect arms control agreement. Second, that what we achieved is a nuclear pause, not a nuclear halt". Mattis argues that the nuclear inspections may fail to prevent Iran from seeking to develop nuclear weapons, but that [...] "f nothing else at least we will have better targeting data if it comes to a fight in the future." ...|$|E

5000|$|Elaine Atwell stated about Maxine's cancer storyline, [...] "It {{turns out}} that the ONE DAY she was forced to act as Top Dog was the day her cancer decided to metastasize. Now it’s in both her breasts and her lymph nodes, and she’s facing a double mastectomy. Which: that is ridiculous and not how disease works, but we’re <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> prop up our disbelief on stilts if it won’t suspend itself." ...|$|E
5000|$|SIOP-62 {{included}} the virtual obliteration {{of the tiny}} country of Albania because within its borders sat huge Soviet air-defense radar, {{which had to be}} taken out with high assurance. Power smiled at Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara and said with a mock straight face: “Well, Mr. Secretary, I hope you don’t have any friends or relations in Albania, because we are <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> wipe it out.” [...] McNamara was left with “macabre, shallow, and horrifying” impression.|$|E
5000|$|As the {{incumbent}} New Zealand national captain, Marshall was again selected {{to play in}} the 2013 NRL All Stars game. Weeks later, New Zealand coach Stephen Kearney announced that Marshall had been dropped as the team's captain. Marshall said, [...] "It was the proudest moment of my career, captaining my country. I was lucky enough that I got to break the record for most caps as Kiwi captain. The decision was Steve's and the New Zealand Rugby League's, and it's just a decision I'm <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> live with." ...|$|E

5000|$|Douglas Lathrop {{explained}} in the Society of Professional Journalists The Quill that these rights-based publications sprung up because many in the disability community were tired of the persistent negative media stereotypes {{of people with disabilities}} as inspirational or courageous in the mainstream news media. [...] "In light of this persistent reliance on oppressive stereotypes, the disability press fills the void," [...] Lathrop said. Lucy Gwin, the editor of Mouth, {{explained in}} The Quill: [...] "Nobody (in the nondisabled media) is going to cover the disability-rights movement, so we’re <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> cover it our own damn selves." ...|$|E
5000|$|No {{repair or}} upgrade {{work can be}} {{embarked}} upon until 1:30am each night, which is when the MBTA stops running trains. [...] Matisse himself had to personally repair the sculpture whenever it broke, {{and he was not}} able to find any organization or corporation that was willing to take over the upkeep of the Band. Because of this, Matisse eventually abandoned the work after roughly 20 years of maintenance. He later stated, “I just kept it going, and then at one point I decided that I was <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> let it go out on its own... Sort of like one’s kids. The time comes." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Marc Morano, Nye {{was asked about the}} prospect of jailing or punishing climate change deniers. He indicated he was open to the idea, saying, [...] "We'll see what happens". Nye then compared the issue to instances in which people were punished for misleading the public, asking, [...] "Was it appropriate to jail the guys from Enron?... Was it appropriate to jail people from the cigarette industry who insisted that this addictive product was not addictive, and so on?" [...] In July 2017, Nye observed that the majority of climate change deniers are older people, and stated, [...] "so we're <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> wait for those people to 'age out', as they say".|$|E

5000|$|The album has {{received}} very positive reviews from music critics.A review from MetalSucks stated that [...] "A {{little more than}} halfway through “Out from Below,” the opening track from Sylosis’ Monolith, the band breaks out what {{must be one of}} the best Metallica riffs that Metallica never wrote; then, just twenty seconds later, the band suddenly-but-seamlessly transitions into what might actually be the best Metallica riff that Metallica never wrote. Fans of thrash that feels traditionalist, but not retro, will find themselves completely unable to turn Monolith off from that point forward; the album has now sunk its hooks into your skin like a Cenobite, and you are <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> hang there and go with it." ...|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the largest}} issues {{expected}} to face Governor Bush was the unpopular image of his brother, President George W. Bush, {{as well as many}} who said they did not wish to see a third Bush in the presidency. Governor Bush came out saying [...] "I'm my own man" [...] with regard to his policies and vision, further saying [...] "I love my mom and dad. I love my brother, and people are <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> get over that." [...] Governor Bush publicly stated that his brother was his [...] "top foreign policy advisor", having learned from his brother's presidency about [...] "protecting the homeland", and that his brother [...] "kept us safe." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the opening}} scene, Herpich used unicorn symbolism, most notable the {{tapestry}} The Unicorn is in Captivity and No Longer Dead, {{a piece of}} the seven-part tapestry The Hunt of the Unicorn, to illustrate the themes of the episode. According to then-character designer Andy Ristaino, the decision was conscientious, but that [...] "as for the meaning you're <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> think about unicorn symbology and how that relates to a specific character in the episode." [...] Later, in the DVD commentary for the fourth season, Herpich revealed that the unicorn is representative of the Lich, because they both have one horn. The ending of the episode, featuring Farmworld Finn and a different animation style, had previously been foreshadowed in the earlier fourth-season episode [...] "King Worm".|$|E

50|$|John Lundrigan: The {{question}} I {{raised to}} the Right Honourable Prime Minister of Canada was {{that the government should}} introduce some new programs to lift the unemployment burden over and above what has been announced since last March. The Prime Minister interrupted me in a way that you wouldn't expect on the street, by mouthing a four-letter obscenity which I've challenged him to verbally place on the record and I don't think he's done so since. And I certainly didn't expect this kind of behaviour from my Prime Minister of Canada, having worshipped and really adored men like John Diefenbaker and Mr Pearson {{and a lot of other}} people in the past. This to me is really inexcusable and, well I guess we're <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> grin and bear it, along with the Lapalme workers.|$|E

He said, [...] "Anyone who wants a good whuppin' from me is <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> wait until sundown." [...] There are as many as 70 Jewish holy days each year on which he will not fight, and he follows Jewish dietary laws. When he's training, he stays within walking distance of a synagogue for Friday and Saturday services, and he does not drive on the sabbath.|$|E
5000|$|López stopped writing {{entries in}} his diary and began filming a video diary. According to López, the diary's purpose was to {{document}} [...] "my life, my art and my plan. Comfort is what I seek in speaking to you ... I am being my own psychologist. You are a camera. I am Ricardo." [...] The diary eventually numbered eleven video tapes containing approximately two hours of footage each. The tapes were filmed in his apartment and contain footage of López preparing his [...] "revenge" [...] and discussing his [...] "crush that ended up as an obsession" [...] over Björk. By the time he began his video diary, López's anger over Björk's relationship with Goldie intensified and {{he decided that he}} had to kill her.
