It is a {{relative}} of the gray garden slug, Deroceras reticulatum (Muller), and shares manyaspects of its biology. Both are common pests of garden vegetables, field crops, and ornamentals throughout the United States and Canada. The marsh slug may be found in such habitats as forests, as well as in fields and <b>greenhouses.</b> The marsh <b>slug</b> attacks seedlings of a number of field crops, including no-tillage corn and alfalfa. It also damages lettuce, beans, and fruits such as strawberries. Slug populations may vary considerably from year to year, and are highest in wet years...|$|R

Here we document rapid loss of molluscicidal bait pellets to earthworms and the resulting adverse effects on slug control. Three years of field studies were conducted at 17 locations with contrasting crops, soil types, residue levels, and tillage management programs. Baits were isolated in covered, sunken, open bottom arenas in the field to exclude removal by slugs, rodents, or birds. Forty hours of nighttime field observations and photographic documentation were collected to support the hypothesis that earthworms were removing slug bait before it had the opportunity to kill <b>slugs.</b> <b>Greenhouse</b> studies were conducted on the gray field slug (Derocerus reticula turn Mueller), in screen-topped arenas to determine the effects on mortality, seedling survival, and egg fecundity in a bait-depleting environment. Field data showed that an average of 17...|$|R
