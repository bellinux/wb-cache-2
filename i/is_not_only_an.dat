25|$|Today's opinion has no {{foundation}} in American constitutional law, and barely pretends to. The people of Colorado have adopted an entirely reasonable provision {{which does not}} even disfavor homosexuals in any substantive sense, but merely denies them preferential treatment. Amendment 2 is designed to prevent piecemeal deterioration of the sexual morality favored {{by a majority of}} Coloradans, and <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>an</b> appropriate means to that legitimate end, but a means that Americans have employed before. Striking it down is an act, not of judicial judgment, but of political will.|$|E

25|$|In {{his work}} on the history of religion, Eliade is most highly {{regarded}} for his writings on Alchemy, Shamanism, Yoga and what he called the eternal return—the implicit belief, supposedly present in religious thought in general, that religious behavior <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>an</b> imitation of, but also a participation in, sacred events, and thus restores the mythical time of origins. Eliade's thinking was in part influenced by Rudolf Otto, Gerardus van der Leeuw, Nae Ionescu and the writings of the Traditionalist School (René Guénon and Julius Evola). For instance, Eliade's The Sacred and the Profane partially builds on Otto's The Idea of the Holy to show how religion emerges from the experience of the sacred, and myths of time and nature.|$|E
25|$|The Archeological-Mining of the Sierra Gorda Project {{was begun}} in the 1970s, based on an earlier {{interdisciplinary}} study carried out at the Sierra de Querétaro. The project {{was supported by the}} federal and state governments as well as UNAM. The project further mapped the cities of Las Ranas and Toluqillo. Further studies in the 1980s consolidated earlier findings and worked out settlement patterns in the wider area. Continued work at that time classified the ancient cultures and register more than 500 sites, encompassing all of northern Querétaro and into San Luis Potosí. The effect of mercury poisoning <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>an</b> ancient problem but a modern one as well. These studies are also investigating the high levels of certain chronic diseases in the current population. The theory is that there is widespread mercury contamination in the environment because of it build up from mining for over hundreds of years.|$|E

It was described by entertainment.ie: “Little Sparks <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>an</b> album which is Delorentos’ best work to date, but one of the finest Irish releases of recent times" [...] and by the Irish Times as [...] "Full of brave, bracing and emotionally direct songs, it’s the sound of a band who have found their musical and lyrical groove.", and by hotpress as “An early bid for Irish album of the year… Little sparks is the sound of a group striving to write the flab-free, solid-gold pop record of their lives, mission accomplished.” ...|$|E

500|$|The {{challenges}} to the speculation about the break-up or salvage of the eurozone is rooted in its innate nature that the break-up or salvage of eurozone <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>an</b> economic decision but also a critical political decision followed by complicated ramifications that [...] "If Berlin pays the bills and tells the rest of Europe how to behave, it risks fostering destructive nationalist resentment against Germany and... it would strengthen the camp in Britain arguing for an exit—a problem not just for Britons but for all economically liberal Europeans. Solutions which involve greater integration of European banking and fiscal management and supervision of national decisions by European umbrella institutions can be criticised as Germanic domination of European political and economic life. According to US author Ross Douthat [...] "This would effectively turn the European Union {{into a kind of}} postmodern version of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire, with a Germanic elite presiding uneasily over a polyglot imperium and its restive local populations".|$|E
500|$|In {{the episode}} of the {{delusion}} of Sati in Ramcharitmanas, Sati sees many a Shiva, Brahma and Vishnu serving Rama and bowing at his feet. When Manu and Shatarupa perform penance, they crave to see that Supreme Lord [...] "from a part of whose being emanate a number of Shivas, Brahmas and Vishnus." [...] Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva come to them many times tempting them with a boon, but Manu and Shatarupa do not stop their penance. They are finally satisfied only {{by the appearance of}} Rama, on whose left side is Sita, from a part of whom are born [...] "countless Lakshmis, Umas (Parvatis) and Brahmanis (Sarasvatis)." [...] In the episode of marriage of Sita and Rama in Balkand, the trio of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva is present – Brahma is astounded as he finds nowhere anything that is his own handiwork, while Vishnu is enchanted with Lakhmi on seeing Rama. In the Sundarkand, Hanuman tells Ravana that Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva can create, preserve and destroy by the might of Rama. In the Lankakand, Tulsidas presents the universe as the cosmic form of Rama, in which Shiva is the consciousness, Brahma is the reason and Vishnu is his intelligence. As per Tulsidas, Rama <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>an</b> avatar, but also the source of avatars – Krishna is also an Avatar of Rama. Thus, Tulsidas clearly considers Rama as supreme brahman and not an avatar of Vishnu.|$|E

[...] He probably wrote the words for almost all of his chansons (anticipating Wagner by four hundred years!).
