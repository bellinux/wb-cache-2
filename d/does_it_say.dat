2500|$|Another {{example of}} a great {{humanitarian}} action was performed by squad chief Lieutenant Colonel Ushakov, which received from you praiseworthy and commendable words: not entering you in battle because of my injured soldiers, I left for Arkevan and Lankaran through a woody road, wanting to save them from captivity and followed the convoy which was accompanied by unarmed injured soldiers and Russian refugees, totalling 350 people, of whom 260 were injured soldiers, 40 caretakers of the horses, and 50 Russian fugitive soldiers. Having reached all {{of them on the}} road, the battalion led by Ushakov captured only the Russian fugitives, while the other 300 peoples were brutally executed, leaving no single one of them alive, as they were Muslims, despite the fact that all of them were basically walking dead, being injured and unarmed. Is this meant to the people you say you love? Where is your God [...] — Jesus, saying [...] "Love your neighbor as you love yourself, and the raised sword will perish by the sword." [...] Where <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>say</b> that we should kill prisoners, and even the sick and injured? Of this atrocity, ferocity, and brutality, are only our soldiers capable of. Based on your Gospel's saying [...] "the raised sword will perish by the sword". — I confidently predict, and foretell that is there is something good for Persia, when your soldiers, will rebel against their rulers themselves and will kill all the generals together with their evil kill for all that they have done to their neighbouring countries, and that there will remain no trace of them.|$|E
