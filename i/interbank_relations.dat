50|$|Since 1992, Mikail Shishkhanov has {{combined}} {{his study}} with work for B&N Industrial and Financial Company. During {{a short period}} of time, he took the position of General Director. In 1994, he joined B&N Bank where he held various positions from the Head of <b>Interbank</b> <b>Relations</b> Department to the Vice President and Deputy CEO. Shishkhanov has been President and CEO of B&N Bank since January 1996 to July 2015. Today Shishkhanov is the Chairman of the Board of Directors of B&N Bank and the Chairman of the Management Board of MDM Bank. Shishkhanov is an active participant in the banking community: Member of the Board of Russian Bankers’ Association and Moscow Banking Union. Shishkhanov is the author of two monographies and a set of books in economics and law.|$|E
50|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} {{the banking system}} still lacked some of the {{services}} and characteristics that were considered basic in most countries. <b>Interbank</b> <b>relations</b> were very limited, and interbank borrowing and lending was virtually unknown. Checking accounts were used by very few individuals, and bank credit cards did not exist. In 1986 initial steps were taken {{in some of these}} areas. Interbank borrowing and lending networks were created among twenty-seven cities along the Yangtze River and among fourteen cities in north China. Interregional financial networks were created to link banks in eleven leading cities all over China, including Shenyang, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Chongqing, and Xi'an and also to link the branches of the Agricultural Bank. The first Chinese credit card, the Great Wall Card, was introduced in June 1986 to be used for foreign exchange transactions. Another financial innovation in 1986 was the opening of China's first stock exchanges since 1949. Small stock exchanges began operations somewhat tentatively in Shenyang, Liaoning Province, in August 1986 and in Shanghai in September 1986.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of the in terbank market risk premium in the Czech Republic during the global financial crisis. We e xplain the significant departure of interbank interest rates from the key monetary policy rate by a combination of different factors, including liquidity risk, counterparty risk, forei gn influence, <b>interbank</b> <b>relations,</b> and strategic behavior. The results suggest a relevant role of market factors, and some importance of counterparty risk...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims to {{identify}} determinants of liquidity among Hungarian commercial banks. The data cover {{the period from}} 2001 to 2010. Results of panel data regression analysis show that bank liquidity is positively related to capital adequacy of banks, interest rate on loans and bank profitability and negatively related {{to the size of}} the bank, interest margin, monetary policy interest rate and the interest rate on <b>interbank</b> transactions. The <b>relation</b> between the growth rate of GDP and bank liquidity is ambiguous...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} impact of capital {{adequacy}} regulation on bank insolvency and aggregate investment. We develop {{a model of the}} banking system that is characterized by the interaction of many heterogeneous banks with the real sector, <b>interbank</b> credit <b>relations</b> as a consequence of bank liquidity management and an insolvency mechanism. This allows us to study {{the impact of}} capital adequacy regulation on systemic risk. In particular we can analyze the impact of regulation on contagious defaults arising from mutual credit relations. We show that the impact of capital adequacy on systemic stability is ambiguous and that systemic risk might actually increase as a consequence of imposing capital constraints on banks. Furthermore we analyze the indirect consequences of capital adequacy regulation that are transmitted to the real economy by their impact on equilibrium interbank rates and thus the opportunity costs of liquidity within the banking system. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} effects of capital {{adequacy}} regulation on bank insolvency and aggregate investment. We show that while the risk of bank insolvency may be reduced there are economic costs arising from repercussions of regulation on aggregate economic activity. Solvency regulation restricts loan supply and has adverse effects on investment. Using {{a model of the}} banking system that is characterized by the interaction of many heterogeneous banks with the real sector, <b>interbank</b> credit <b>relations</b> as a consequence of their lending activities and an insolveny mechanism we can study the economics and the logic of this trade off in detail. 1 The policy discussion on the regulation of banks during the past decade has mainly been concerned with capital adequacy. This focus has been reinforced by the work of the Basel Committee that makes refinements of existing capital adequacy rules the core part of its regulatory reform work known as ‘‘Basel II’’. The Regulation is intended to reduce th...|$|R
40|$|Probably, {{one test}} of the {{stability}} of the banking system is to evaluate how risky assets are distributed across banks’ portfolios and the implications for the contagion via <b>interbank</b> <b>relations.</b> This paper explores theoretically a bank sector with risks concentration and the functioning of interbank markets. It employs a simple model where banks are exposed to both credit and liquidity risk that suddenly correlate over the business cycle. We show that risk concentration makes interbank market breakdowns more likely and welfare monotonically decreases in risk concentration...|$|E
40|$|Our {{dynamic model}} captures the network {{relations}} generated by credit risk transfer andsecuritization. Each bank determines its own {{level of risk}} according to fundamentals and the levelof risk of its environment, given the possibilities opened by credit risk transfer. The dynamics ofthe model is generated by the network structure of the <b>interbank</b> <b>relations.</b> A highly connectednetwork generates forces {{able to make the}} long term equilibrium of the bank industry dependanton initial conditions. Irregularity in the network can also explain that a final heterogeneity appearin the final situation of banks, even when their fundamentals were originally similar. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|In a Diamond and Dybvig [1983] frame where {{liquidity}} shocks are unknown, banks embbed into {{a network}} of partners in which to embed so as to decentralize Pareto optimal allocation. Doing so, they increase investment in long term assets, and welfare. The resulting network structure tackles {{the issue of the}} unknown liquidity shock distribution and drives to rate of interest to the risk free level. However, because of competition for funds, the chosen architecture is not complete and does not maximizes available liquidity. Because of the network of <b>interbank</b> <b>relations,</b> a small isolated liquidity shock may turn into a major systemic banking crisis. network, bank, contagion, financial fragilities...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a review of}} recent research {{on the structure of}} <b>interbank</b> <b>relations</b> and theoretical models developed to assess the contagious potential of shocks (default of single units) via the interbank network. The empirical literature has established a set of stylized facts that includes a fat-tailed distribution of the number of banks, disassortativity of credit links and a pronounced persistence of existing links over time. These topological features correspond to the existence of money center banks, the importance of relationship banking and the self-organization of the interbank market into a core-periphery structure. Models designed to replicate these topological features exhibit on average more contagious potential than baseline models for the generation of random networks (such as the Erd 6 s-Renyi or preferential attachment mechanisms) that do not share the stylized facts. Combining different channels of contagion such as interbank exposures, portfolio overlaps and common exposure to non-financial borrowers, one typically finds that different contagion channels interact in a distinctly nonlinear way...|$|E
