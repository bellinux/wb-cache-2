5|$|Plan 9 is a {{distributed}} operating system, {{designed to}} make a network of heterogeneous and geographically separated computers function as a single system. In a typical Plan 9 installation, users work at terminals running the window system rio, and they access CPU servers which handle computation-intensive processes.

5|$|The Altair 8800 {{was modeled}} after early 1970s {{minicomputers}} {{such as the}} Data General Nova. These machines contained a CPU board, memory boards, and I/O boards; the <b>data</b> <b>storage</b> and display terminal were external devices. The Teletype Model 33 ASR was a popular terminal because it provided printed output and <b>data</b> <b>storage</b> on punched paper tape. More advanced systems would have 8-inch floppy disks and a video terminal that would display 24 lines of 80 characters such as the ADM-3A. (No graphics were available and lower-case letters were a $75 option.) Most of these computers had a front panel with toggle switches for entering data and lights for displaying it. These were normally used to boot the computer and to diagnose problems.|$|E

5|$|Dysprosium {{was first}} {{identified}} in 1886 by Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, {{but it was}} not isolated in pure form until the development of ion exchange techniques in the 1950s. Dysprosium has relatively few applications where it cannot be replaced by other chemical elements. It is used for its high thermal neutron absorption cross-section in making control rods in nuclear reactors, for its high magnetic susceptibility in <b>data</b> <b>storage</b> applications, and as a component of Terfenol-D (a magnetostrictive material). Soluble dysprosium salts are mildly toxic, while the insoluble salts are considered non-toxic.|$|E
5|$|Inside the case, {{there were}} many more {{similarities}} with the ZX81. Like its successor, it used the Z80A microprocessor and had only 1KB of on-board RAM. It came with a specially written BASIC interpreter on a dedicated ROM chip and could use a television as a display. It relied on an ordinary cassette tape recorder for <b>data</b> <b>storage.</b> The main {{difference between the two}} machines lay in the internal software; when the ZX81 was released, ZX80 owners were able to upgrade by the relatively simple expedient of plugging a new ROM onto the circuit board.|$|E

40|$|<b>Data</b> centric <b>storages</b> for sensor {{networks}} {{have been proposed}} to efficiently process multi-dimensional range queries as well as exact matches. Usually, a sensor network does not process only one type of the query, but processes various types of queries such as range queries, exact matches and skyline queries. Therefore, a sensor network based on a <b>data</b> centric <b>storage</b> for range queries and exact matches should process skyline queries efficiently. However, existing algorithms for skyline queries have not considered the features of <b>data</b> centric <b>storages.</b> Some of the <b>data</b> centric <b>storages</b> store similar <b>data</b> in sensor nodes that are placed on geographically similar locations. Consequently, all data are ordered in a sensor network. In this paper, we propose a new skyline query processing algorithm that exploits the above features of <b>data</b> centric <b>storages...</b>|$|R

5|$|Nintendo {{eventually}} migrated {{the development}} of Ocarina of Time from disk to cartridge media due to the high data performance requirements imposed by continuously reading 500 motion-captured character animations throughout gameplay, intending to follow its release with a 64DD expansion disk. At its release, the 32-megabyte game would be the largest game Nintendo had ever created. Early in the game's development, concerns about the <b>data</b> <b>storage</b> constraints of the N64 cartridge led producer and supervisor Shigeru Miyamoto to imagine a worst-case scenario in which Ocarina of Time would follow a similar structure to Super Mario 64 with Link being restricted to Ganondorf's castle as a central hub, and using a portal system similar to the paintings that Mario uses to traverse the realm. An idea that arose from this stage of development, a battle with a doppelganger of Ganondorf that rides through paintings, ultimately made {{its way into the}} finished game as the boss of the Forest Temple dungeon.|$|E
5|$|Challenges for the {{localization}} teams include space limitation (due to <b>data</b> <b>storage</b> and/or on-screen space), {{achieving a}} natural dialogue flow despite multiple plot branches and script lines being stored out of order, and, when voiced footage is not re-recorded for lip movement, dealing with file length and lip-synch limitations. When {{the same team}} works on different games in a series such as Final Fantasy, they often need to adopt different writing styles depending on the setting of their games. Another point to consider is humorous elements that do not translate properly into English, and different cultural expectations about character interactions. The localization process depends on {{factors such as the}} development teams' wishes, as well as budget and schedule. Traditionally, translation usually started late in development or after the original Japanese release, but recent titles have been translated during initial development, making the translators appear more like additional planners or consultants and not just translators-this was the case for Final Fantasy XI, Final Fantasy XIII, Final Fantasy XIV and Final Fantasy XV. A few titles, like The Bouncer, have actually been recorded in English first and then adapted to Japanese. The Last Remnant also adopted this approach, featuring motion-capture and dialogue synched to English rather than Japanese actors. This was done due to the company's wish to create a title for the international market.|$|E
5|$|The game {{proceeds}} {{according to}} the Courier's decisions and involves many different events, factions, and characters. The main storyline follows the Courier's pursuit of Benny to both settle the score and retrieve the Platinum Chip. Along the way, the Courier encounters many groups of people with various problems that they can choose to assist with, ignore, or otherwise sabotage, resulting in positive or negative karma. Eventually, after finding Benny and the Chip, the Courier finds themselves {{in the middle of}} a conflict between three major factions: Caesar's Legion, a group of Roman-esque slavers, the New California Republic (NCR), an expansionist democratic federation, and Mr. House (voiced by René Auberjonois), the enigmatic de facto ruler of New Vegas, in command of an army of Securitron robots that patrols the city. Each of the three sides aim to control the Hoover Dam, which is still operational and supplying the Southwest with power and clean, non-irradiated water; thus, control of the dam means effective control of the region. It is revealed that Mr. House, a human from before the Great War and surviving via a contained life support chamber, ordered the Platinum Chip's delivery before the war. The Chip is a <b>data</b> <b>storage</b> device with a program that can upgrade the Securitrons to a greater level of combat effectiveness, and was stolen by Benny as part of a scheme to take over House's security and claim New Vegas for himself with the help of a reprogrammed Securitron named Yes Man.|$|E
