25|$|Disregarding intermediates, {{the basic}} {{distinction}} between asexual and sexual reproduction {{is the way}} in which the genetic material is processed. Typically, prior to an asexual division, a cell duplicates its genetic information content, and then divides. This process of cell division is called mitosis. In sexual reproduction, there are special kinds of cells that divide without prior duplication of its genetic material, in a process named meiosis. The resulting cells are called gametes, and contain only half the genetic material of the parent cells. These gametes are the cells that are prepared for the sexual reproduction of the organism. Sex comprises the arrangements that enable sexual reproduction, and has evolved alongside the reproduction system, starting with similar gametes (<b>isogamy)</b> and progressing to systems that have different gamete types, such as those involving a large female gamete (ovum) and a small male gamete (sperm).|$|E
2500|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} is a biological process {{that creates a}} new organism by combining the genetic material of two organisms {{in a process that}} starts with meiosis, a specialized type of cell division. Each of two parent organisms contributes half of the offspring's genetic makeup by creating haploid gametes. Most organisms form two different types of gametes. In these anisogamous species, the two sexes are referred to as male (producing sperm or microspores) and female (producing ova or megaspores). In isogamous species, the gametes are similar or identical in form (isogametes), but may have separable properties and then may be given other different names (see <b>isogamy).</b> For example, in the green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, there are so-called [...] "plus" [...] and [...] "minus" [...] gametes.

50|$|Reproduction {{varies from}} fusion of {{identical}} cells (<b>isogamy)</b> to fertilization {{of a large}} non-motile cell by a smaller motile one (oogamy). However, these traits show some variation, most notably among the basal green algae called prasinophytes.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Isogamy</b> {{is a form}} {{of sexual}} {{reproduction}} that involves gametes of similar morphology (similar shape and size), differing in general only in allele expression in one or more mating-type regions.

[...] Instead, organisms undergoing <b>isogamy</b> are said to have different mating types, most commonly noted as [...] "+" [...] and [...] "&minus;" [...] strains, although in some species of Basidiomycota there are more than two mating types (designated by numbers or letters).

50|$|It {{appears that}} <b>isogamy</b> {{was the first}} stage of sexual {{reproduction}}.

5000|$|In <b>isogamy,</b> the gametes {{look alike}} and cannot be {{classified}} into [...] "male" [...] or [...] "female." [...] For example, in zygomycetes, two gametangia (single multinucleate cells {{at the end}} of hyphae) form good contact with each other and fuse into a zygosporangium. Inside the zygosporangium, the nuclei from each of the original two gametangia pair up.|$|E
50|$|Both asexual {{and sexual}} {{reproduction}} occur. In the former, cells divide until they form new colonies, {{which are then}} released. In the smaller forms, typically all cells are involved, but larger forms have anterior vegetative and posterior reproductive cells. Sexual reproduction varies from <b>isogamy</b> (both genders produce flagellated gametes of equal size) to oogamy (one gender produces a much larger, nonmotile gamete).|$|E
50|$|Anisogamy is the {{phenomenon}} of fertilization of large gametes (egg cells, ova) by (or with) small gametes (sperm cells: spermatozoa or spermatia). Gamete size difference is the fundamental difference between females and males. Anisogamy first evolved in multicellular haploid species after the differentiation of different mating types had already been established. However, in Ascomycetes, anisogamy evolved from <b>isogamy</b> before mating types.|$|E

50|$|There is then a {{relatively}} sound theory base for understanding this fundamental transition from <b>isogamy</b> to anisogamy {{in the evolution}} of reproduction, which is predicted {{to be associated with the}} transition to multicellularity. Some comparative empirical evidence for the gamete competition theories exists, although it is difficult to use this evidence to fully tease apart the competition and limitation theories because their testable predictions are similar. It has also been claimed that some of the organisms used in such comparative studies do not fit the theoretical assumptions well.|$|E
5000|$|Monogamy {{may have}} arisen as a {{consequence}} of anisogamy and other ecological factors. Anisogamy is a form of sexual reproduction which involves the fusion of two unequally sized gametes. In animals there are two sexes, the male, in which the gamete is small, motile, usually plentiful, and less energetically expensive, and the female, in which the gamete is larger, more energetically expensive, made at a lower rate, and largely immobile. Anisogamy is thought to have evolved from <b>isogamy,</b> the fusion of similar gametes, multiple times in many different species.|$|E
50|$|Tracing {{character}} state {{changes of}} single traits helped elucidate the evolutionary relationships between organisms, {{such as in}} identifying the parallel transition of <b>isogamy</b> to anisogamy. Zimmermann contributed insight into {{the evolution of the}} stele (central part of the root system of plants) by considering phylogenetic similarities and attempting to deduce its ancestral morphology. He tracked across plant phylogenies the common shifting of different plant tissues and organs, such as increases in the meristele number, pinnation of fern leaves, and the occurrence of plant neoteny. In addition, he aided in the classification and taxonomy of many plant groups, such as embryophytes.|$|E
5000|$|In taxonomy, Volvulina is a genus {{of colonial}} green algae, {{specifically}} of the Volvocaceae. The colony (coenobium) is broadly ellipsoidal or spherical {{and consists of}} a fixed number of cells, usually 16 in mature individuals (rarely 4, 8 or 32). The cells are located at periphery of the coenobium and separated from each other by being embedded in a swollen sack. The cell body is lens-shaped or half spherical when mature with two flagella. The chloroplast is dish- or bowl-shaped. Pyrenoids may be present or absent, the stigma large. The nucleus is centrally located {{and there may be}} 4 to 8 contractile vacuoles.

An individual that produces exclusively large gametes is female, and one that produces exclusively small gametes is male.

5000|$|As {{early as}} 1803 Jean Pierre Étienne Vaucher had {{published}} on the <b>isogamy</b> (sexual conjugation) in the algae, {{but it was in}} the early 20th century that reproduction and development began to be extensively studied. The 1935 and 1945 comprehensive volumes of Felix Eugen Fritsch consolidated what was then known about the morphology and reproduction of the algae. This was followed in the 1950s by the development of area checklists, led by Mary W. Parke with her 1931 Manx Algae and followed in 1953 by her [...] "A preliminary check-list of British marine algae" [...] Although Lily Newton's 1931 Handbook provided the first identification key for the algae of the British Isles, it wasn't until the 1960s that the development of such keys became routine. The 1980s with the new emphasis on ecology saw increased study of algal communities, and the place of algae in larger plant communities, and provided an additional tool for explaining geographical variation.|$|E
5000|$|A gamete (from Ancient Greek γαμετή gamete from gamein [...] "to marry") is a {{haploid cell}} that fuses with another haploid cell during {{fertilization}} (conception) in organisms that sexually reproduce. In species that produce two morphologically distinct types of gametes, {{and in which}} each individual produces only one type, a female is any individual that produces the larger type of gamete—called an ovum (or egg)—and a male produces the smaller tadpole-like type—called a sperm. This {{is an example of}} anisogamy or heterogamy, the condition in which females and males produce gametes of different sizes (this is the case in humans; the human ovum has approximately 100,000 times the volume of a single human sperm cell). In contrast, <b>isogamy</b> is the state of gametes from both sexes being the same size and shape, and given arbitrary designators for mating type. The name gamete was introduced by the Austrian biologist Gregor Mendel. Gametes carry half the genetic information of an individual, one ploidy of each type, and are created through meiosis.|$|E
5000|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} is a biological process {{that creates a}} new organism by combining the genetic material of two organisms {{in a process that}} starts with meiosis, a specialized type of cell division. Each of two parent organisms contributes half of the offspring's genetic makeup by creating haploid gametes. Most organisms form two different types of gametes. In these anisogamous species, the two sexes are referred to as male (producing sperm or microspores) and female (producing ova or megaspores). In isogamous species, the gametes are similar or identical in form (isogametes), but may have separable properties and then may be given other different names (see <b>isogamy).</b> For example, in the green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, there are so-called [...] "plus" [...] and [...] "minus" [...] gametes. A few types of organisms, such as many fungi and the ciliate Paramecium aurelia, have more than two [...] "sexes", called syngens.Most animals (including humans) and plants reproduce sexually. Sexually reproducing organisms have different sets of genes for every trait (called alleles). Offspring inherit one allele for each trait from each parent. Thus, offspring have a combination of the parents' genes. It is believed that [...] "the masking of deleterious alleles favors the evolution of a dominant diploid phase in organisms that alternate between haploid and diploid phases" [...] where recombination occurs freely.|$|E

Our results indicate that an isogamous population can be successfully invaded by a gametangium if it produces gametes of a different size. The existence of a low adaptive peak for <b>isogamy</b> and a much higher adaptive peak for anisogamy suggests that stochastic forces may be initially important in driving <b>isogamy</b> through the fitness saddle to anisogamy...|$|E
40|$|<b>Isogamy</b> is a {{reproductive}} system where all gametes are morphologically similar, especially {{in terms of}} size. Its importance goes beyond specific cases: to this day non-anisogamous systems are common outside of multicellular animals and plants, they can be found in all eukaryotic super-groups, and anisogamous organisms appear to have isogamous ancestors. Furthermore, because maleness is synonymous with the production of small gametes, an explanation for the initial origin of males and females is synonymous with understanding the transition from <b>isogamy</b> to anisogamy. As we show here, this transition may also be crucial for understanding why sex itself remains common even in taxa with high costs of male production (the twofold cost of sex). The transition to anisogamy implies the origin of male and female sexes, kickstarts the subsequent evolution of sex roles, and has a major impact on the costliness of sexual reproduction. Finally, we combine some of the consequences of <b>isogamy</b> and anisogamy in a thought experiment on the maintenance of sexual reproduction. We ask what happens if there is a less than twofold benefit to sex (not an unlikely scenario as large short-term benefits have proved difficult to find), and argue that this could lead to a situation where lineages that evolve anisogamy-and thus the highest costs of sex-end up being associated with constraints that make invasion by asexual reproduction unlikely (the 'anisogamy gateway' hypothesis).

40|$|Fieldwork {{was carried}} out among the Hindu Gaddis and their {{associated}} castes, chiefly in Kangra {{and to a lesser}} extent in Chamba (Himachal Pradesh, India), Two main topics are examined. The place of transhumant pastoralism in the Gaddis' economy and in relation to their social organisation is described at length for the first time. Though the Gaddis are renowned as shepherds in Himachal Pradesh, the proportion who hold flocks of sheep and goats fluctuates greatly from village to village. My data stem from living in the Gaddi shepherding village par excellence. I explore the relationship between pastoralism, agriculture and wage labour, and I conclude that numbers of Gaddi-owned migratory livestock have fallen in recent decades. The primary topic, however, is marriage and the internal structure of the caste. I start by looking at an unusual case of women who never marry, and then move on to analyse the complex relationship between <b>isogamy</b> and hypergamy in the region, with particular reference to the structure of the caste. The working out of egalitarian principles in marriage in the northern half of the Indian subcontinent has not received the attention devoted to the more dominant tendency towards hierarchy. But while this study of the Gaddis' <b>isogamy</b> is a contribution to a neglected field, it does not foster any simple dichotomy between Himalayan Hindus and north India generally.

40|$|Classic {{theory on}} the {{evolution}} of anisogamy focuses on the trade-off between gamete productivity and provisioning and mechanisms associated with post-zygotic survival. In this article, the role of mortality acting on both zygotes and gametes is explored as a factor influencing the evolution of different sized gametes. In particular, variable mortality through differential survival or metabolic damage is shown to affect the persistence of <b>isogamy,</b> the evolution of more than two sexes and the evolution of anisogamy. Evolutionary stable isogamous states are shown to be locally unstable and disruptive selection can induce the evolution of anisogamy. Analysis of both the isogamous and anisogamous ESS points reveals that the persistence of either of these conditions is not always assured.
