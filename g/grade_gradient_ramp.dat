We examine the contribution of job and financial insecurity to these at Phase 5 in 6770 women and men, {{all of whom were}} white-collar civil servants at Phase 1. Steep, inverse employment <b>grade</b> <b>gradients</b> were observed for all health measures at Phase 5, except cholesterol and systolic blood pressure in women. Gradients in the sub-population of non-employed participants tended to be steeper than gradients for participants in employment, although, with the exception of self-rated health and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) score in men, differences were non-significant. Steep gradients in job insecurity were observed among employed participants (p[less-than-or-equals, slant] 0. 01), and in financial insecurity among both employed and non-employed participants (p[less-than-or-equals, slant] 0. 001), particularly non-employed men. With the exception of depression, adjustment for job insecurity had little effect on the employment <b>grade</b> <b>gradients</b> in morbidity. However, financial insecurity contributed substantially to gradients in self-rated health, longstanding illness, and depression in both employed and non-employed men, and additionally to GHQ score and diastolic blood pressure in the latter. Adjustment for financial insecurity in non-employed women substantially attenuated gradients in self-rated health, GHQ score and depression. These findings imply that the specific effects of job insecurity in this cohort may be less important than the more general effects of financial insecurity in determining inequalities in health.

Women and men learned a target location in the presence of either one or the other class of cues. Men were more accurate in estimating the target location overall, but the navigation accuracy difference between men and women was greater in the presence of directional cues.

40|$|A {{parametric}} {{experimental study}} was performed with sweeping jet actuators (fluidic oscillators) {{to determine their}} effectiveness in controlling flow separation on an adverse pressure <b>gradient</b> <b>ramp.</b> Actuator parameters that were investigated include blowing coefficients, operation mode, pitch and spreading angles, streamwise location, aspect ratio, and scale. Surface pressure measurements and surface oil flow visualization were used to characterize {{the effects of these}} parameters on the actuator performance. 2 D Particle Image Velocimetry measurements of the flow field over the ramp and hot-wire measurements of the actuator's jet flow were also obtained for selective cases. In addition, the sweeping jet actuators were compared to other well-known flow control techniques such as micro-vortex generators, steady blowing, and steady vortex-generating jets. The results confirm that the sweeping jet actuators are more effective than steady blowing and steady vortex-generating jets. The results also suggest that an actuator with a larger spreading angle placed closer to the location where the flow separates provides better performance. For the cases tested, an actuator with an aspect ratio, which is the width/depth of the actuator throat, of 2 was found to be optimal. For a fixed momentum coefficient, decreasing the aspect ratio to 1 produced weaker vortices while increasing the aspect ratio to 4 reduced coverage area. Although scaling down the actuator (based on the throat dimensions) from 0. 25 inch x 0. 125 inch to 0. 15 inch x 0. 075 inch resulted in similar flow control performance, scaling down the actuator further to 0. 075 inch x 0. 0375 inch reduced the actuator efficiency by reducing the coverage area and the amount of mixing in the near-wall region.

This study investigates {{a range of}} slope to basin floor topographic configurations with multi-scale (mm to 100 km) variability, using regionally extensive exposures from the Permian slope to basin floor deposits in the Laingsburg depocentre, Karoo Basin, South Africa. Over 400 outcrop logs, totalling 14 km in thickness, combined with a large database from earlier Stratigraphy Group studies, are {{used to assess the}} influence of dynamic seabed relief on turbidity current processes and depositional patterns across a range of scales, and their transfer into the stratigraphic record. Degradation plays a large role in shaping submarine slopes. The formation and evolution of a submarine slide complex is investigated, including time transgressive lateral margins of basal shear surfaces/zones and varyingly confined of remobilized and turbidite infill. The base of slope is a key area of gradient change. Here, the spatial and temporal variations of a channel-lobe transition zone (CLTZ) are documented, including how topographic influence on turbidity currents varies and evolves, causing CLTZ expansion/contraction and migration. In addition, how these topographically complex areas are transferred into the stratigraphic record, as single surfaces and volumes of rock, is discussed. Areas of dynamic and fixed topography have been recognised as having long-term effects, leading to the evolution of a stepped slope profile.

40|$|A large palaeochannel on {{the northeastern}} Australian {{continental}} shelf has been imaged {{by a series}} of shallow seismic reflection profiles. The buried channel forms an important Pleistocene route of the Burdekin River and extends almost continuously for not, vert, similar 160 km from the present coast to the outermost reef. The channel floor profile steps across the shelf with alternating segments of gentle gradient (flats) and steeper <b>gradient</b> (<b>ramps).</b> Channel sinuosity as interpreted from seismic records varies among segments between 1 and 1. 72, with no consistent relationship between sinuosity and gradient. The lower and upper parts of the channel fill have different geometry and reflection character, suggesting channel excavation and initial filling occurred during a different regime than final filling. In one section of the shelf, about the − 50 m isobath, the channel is difficult to define and appears to have wandered significantly, either because it has been modified by shoreface erosion ca. 10. 5 ka or because the river encountered a change in topography in front of karstified reefs. As the channel passes between the numerous outer shelf reefs, in water depths of 70 – 80 m, it becomes progressively smaller, conspicuously underfilled, and absent entirely over the outermost 10 km of the shelf. No discrete lowstand river mouth could be recognised on the present shelf edge. The elevations of flat segments on the channel floor profile show considerable similarity to published elevations of stillstands or brief rises in sea level attained during the long-term drawdown associated with the last glacial cycle (125 – 20 ka) and are interpreted to have formed during this stepwise drop in sea level. Channels were cut and partially filled during the fall and lowstand and then backfilled during the Holocene transgression. The ancestral channel of the Burdekin River therefore preserves a rare insight into the stratigraphic record of falling sea level during the last glacial. ...|$|R
40|$|Summary of Chapter 5 : Results - Continuous EPI: The aim of {{the work}} {{presented}} in this chapter was to characterize the spatial and temporal imaging characteristics of the Continuous EPI sequence compared to the standard (conventional) EPI sequence, and to compare and optimize its performance in relation to conventional EPI for the use in auditory fMRI experiments. Characterization Two characteristic image artifacts which appear in the Continuous EPI sequence were identified and characterized. One, based on the irregular echo spacing of the readout train, results in a multiple ghosting artifact, which is hardly noticeable under practical conditions. The other, resulting from gradient shape imperfections in the water excitation slice select gradients, leads to an intensity modulation over multi-slice images and can be corrected by a system-specific bias on {{the second of the}} two slice selection gradients. Further, the fat suppression using these water selective binomial pulses was shown to be equally effective when applied to conventional and Continuous EPI sequences. For fMRI applications, the temporal signal stability of a sequence is a crucial factor influencing the detection efficiency of functional activation. Based on histograms of the voxel-wise relative standard deviation, the temporal stability of Continuous EPI could be shown to be equal to that of matched conventional EPI sequences at 1. 5, 3 and 7 T. Finally, based on sequence sound recordings, the use of “soft”, sinusoidally shaped <b>gradient</b> <b>ramps</b> (which occupy {{a large part of the}} gradient duration) are beneficial for the suppression of the pulsating sound component. fMRI experiments The second part of this chapter consisted in the results of seven auditory fMRI experiments in which conventional and Continuous EPI sequences were compared.
