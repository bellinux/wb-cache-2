40|$|Owing to the {{improper}} {{management of}} wastewater {{in many cities}} in Vietnam, {{a large number of}} urban and peri-urban farmers are engaged in the practice of wastewater for irrigation and aquaculture. Especially in Hanoi, total area irrigated with wastewater is 43, 778 ha and involved 658, 300 farmers (L Raschid-Sally & Jayakody, 2008). Despite the amount of wastewater utilized by urban farmers are expected to increase due to the larger amount of wastewater generated from urban population, and the contribution of urban farmers to generate vast quantity of urban waste including solids and wastewater through agriculture practices (Brody Lee, 2010), these activities are very little recognized by municipal's management authorities (Do et al., 2006) nor looked down by the community. Therefore, wastewater unitization by urban farmers remains as informal, unplanned and spontaneous practices. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate into farmers'managerial capacity wastewater irrigation. Individual aspect of farmers'wastewater irrigation management capacities are personal characteristics and skills (including drives and motivations, abilities and capabilities and biography). Farmers perform their tasks in the environment that is influenced by various factors. Boehlje and Eidman (1984) distinguish four major dimensions: (1) the institutional environment; (2) the social environment; (3) the physical environment; and (4) the economic environment. By applying sustainability science and system dynamic approach, this research sought answers for following questions: (1) How farmers practice wastewater irrigation? (2) How they perceived of risks/benefits of wastewater irrigation? (3) Are they willing to adopt measurements to reduce risks while engaging in wastewater irrigation? (4) What are factors affecting farmers'managerial capacity toward wastewater irrigation management? This research selected 2 communities: Thanh Liet, Dong Ba in peri-urban area of Hanoi according to its typical practices of wastewater irrigation in Vietnam. GIS device was used to map the study area, irrigation systems, water sampling points and cropping pattern. Quality of irrigation water was analyzed both on site and in laboratory by using simple test kits and portable water quality meter. General information of the communities and agriculture activities of the farmers were obtained from key informants. Combined informal interviews and participatory observation were applied for farmers either at the field when working or at their homes Total 29 farmers were interviewed in both areas. The number of female participated were outnumbered men (18 female / 11 male farmers). All farmers interviewed were literate with primary and upper education and most of them were involved in rice cultivation. Farmers in Thanh Liet were exposed more to wastewater than Dong Ba farmers in terms of exposure time and concentration of wastewater. Most farmer households have access to hygienic latrines with septic tank while fewer farmer households could access to tap water. Data from water sampling showed that many water quality parameters in both areas do not meet the standards, especially very high number of detected E. coli and Total Coli forms. However, when distributing into the plots, the quality of water is improved by flowing through long distance of channels and undergone natural treatment. From preliminary assessment of water quality, it can be seen that wastewater irrigation has some potential to be reused for farmers in terms of nutrient recovery (Table 7) and income generation as well as bring s high risk for human health relating to pathogens (i. e., the risk of diarrheal disease associated with consuming salad crop irrigated with wastewater in Thanh Liet was 2 x 10 - 5. This is 2 times higher than WHO's tolerable risk of infection of 10 - 3 per person per year, but lower than the estimated incidents of diarrheal disease in Western Pacific region, i. e., 0. 72 pppy (WHO, 2009)). Farmers in Thanh Liet have more experiences in wastewater agriculture compare to farmers in Dong Ba. They have more knowledge about the contaminants and risk posed by wastewater, mainly by physical appearances and experience of diseases. Dong Ba farmers on the other hand are more concerned about invisible risks since they were informed by various channels such as the media or relatives or neighbors, but they insisted that the irrigation water in Dong Ba is from Red river, therefore it is clean. Many farmers in Thanh Liet are observed to wear protective clothes especially gloves and boots to protect the skin from contacting with the wastewater. This practice is either seen on women or men. In contrast, very few farmers in Dong Ba answered that they wear gloves and many of them said it is not necessary and uncomfortable. The quality of water seems to affect the crop pattern. Thanh Liet farmers shows more adaptation than Dong Ba farmers, they shift from rice to other aquatic vegetables Regarding to willingness of farmers to adopt measures in 2 study areas, 59 % farmers agreed that wearing protective cloth; 76 % <b>keep</b> <b>hygienic</b> of food and drinks are effective to protect their physical health (Figure 53). This research found that wastewater irrigation in Hanoi peri-urban agriculture and urban wastewater management were integrated system. Despite of being linked in urban wastewater and urban food chain, wastewater farmers behaved independent and self interested among peers and others which results in some short terms measures such as generate income from wastewater fed fish ponds, aquatic plants or non-food crops, reduce occupational health risks or keep cleanliness of food and drinks to improve health. The study found out that the factors influenced farme's capacities of wastewater irrigation governance are: - Internal factors are: (1) age of farmers, (2) experience in wastewater irrigation, (3) knowledge and skill in wastewater irrigation, (4) motivation in wastewater agriculture. - External factors are: (1) institutional environment includes regulation on wastewater use in agriculture, decentralised/centralised wastewater management, spatial separation on governance responsibilities of different department, state of participatory in local cooperatives; (2) physical environment such as climate change, diseases outbreak, constituent in wastewater; (3) social environment consists of social linkage and norms; (4) economic environment: consumer buying behaviour and income from wastewater agriculture. Farmers'behaviour where more driven by economical and physical factors, while institutional and social factors appeared to discourage farmers to have high performance of farming. This research proposes two mechanisms for strengthening farmers'managerial capacity on wastewater governance via wastewater irrigation, i. e. strengthening social participation and institutional involvement of farmers. 報告番号:; 学位授与年月日: 2011 - 09 - 27; 学位の種別: 修士; 学位の種類: 修士(サステイナビリティ学); 学位記番号: 修創域第 4104 号; 研究科・専攻: 新領域創成科学研究科環境学研究系サステイナビリティ学教育プログラ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background In Vietnam, {{efforts are}} {{underway}} to improve latrine use in rural and remote areas with particular focus on increasing coverage of sanitation in schools. However, {{there is a}} lack of information on how the school program affects latrine use by schoolchildren and at community level. This paper analyzes sanitation use among schoolchildren in a multi-ethnic area to inform future school-based sanitation promotion programmes. Methods A combination of quantitative and qualitative methods was applied during a 5 months period in six primary and secondary schools and in the homes of schoolchildren in four different ethnic villages in Northern rural Vietnam. Using a structured questionnaire, 319 children were interviewed face-to-face to collect quantitative data. Qualitative methods included extensive observations at schools and in the homes of 20 children, a single day's diary writings of 234 children, in-depth interviews with children (20), their parents (20) and school staff (10), and focus group discussions with parents (4) and teachers (6), and picture drawing with children (12). Results All surveyed schools had student latrines. However, the observed schoolchildren most commonly urinated and defecated in the open. Main barriers for latrine use included inadequate number of latrines, limited accessibility to latrines, lack of constant water supply in latrines and lack of latrine maintenance by school management. Programs promoting latrine use for children were not conducted in either schools or communities and were not established as a preferred social norm in such settings. Children perceived existing school latrines as unappealing and expressed a wish to have basic, functional, clean, and colorful school latrines with privacy. Conclusions The paper shows that the current school based sanitation promotion is insufficient to change sanitation behavior of school children irrespective of their ethnicity. It is important that schools, households and communities work more closely together to increase use and uptake of latrine use among schoolchildren. Also, the contractors of latrine facilities must work more closely with local school management when constructing latrines, including identifying location, design and appropriate systems of water supply. A separate budget needs to be allocated to allow the school to maintain the sanitation infrastructure and <b>keep</b> it <b>hygienic</b> and appealing for users. </p...|$|R
