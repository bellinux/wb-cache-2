25|$|In the Gothenburg study, a {{questionnaire}} for preschool teachers was used from which children with some potential psychiatric problems were classified into either a high-index or a low-index group. In the final investigation, there were 22 children (14 boys and 8 girls) in the high-index group and 60 children (52 boys and 8 girls) in the low-index group. These {{were compared with}} a randomly selected control group. The control group ultimately consisted of 59 children (29 boys and 30 girls). Of the total of 141 children, 42 (33 boys and 9 girls) were diagnosed as having MBD/DAMP; of the 42, 40 were in the <b>index</b> <b>group</b> (18 in the high-index group) and 2 in the control group.

By a quite different approach from others, our theorems optimize some previous results which are committed to finding sharp conditions for some classical convolution inequalities.
