Examples synthesized on an industrial scale include octyl phenol <b>ethoxylate,</b> polysorbate 80 and poloxamers.Ethoxylation is commonly practiced, albeit on a much smaller scale, in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries to increase water solubility and, in the case of pharmaceuticals, circulatory half-life of non-polar organic compounds. In this application, ethoxylation is known as [...] "PEGylation" [...] (polyethylene oxide is synonymous with polyethylene glycol, abbreviated as PEG). Carbon chain length is 8-18 while the ethoxylated chain is usually 3 to 12 ethylene oxides long in home products. They feature both lipophilic tails, indicated by the alkyl group abbreviation, R, and relatively polar headgroups, represented by the formula (OC2H4)nOH.|$|E

50|$|Nonylphenol {{is a large}} {{issue for}} T. carnifex {{because it is a}} very common toxin found in leakage from sewers into the habitat of the Italian crested newt.

The compounds nonylphenol as well as <b>ethoxylate</b> surfactants can be found in polluted rivers, where the newts reside. The two substances discussed can be transformed, by microorganisms, into compounds which are much more toxic. They are extremely good bioindicators, due to the magnification of these chemicals in the environment demonstrated in the newt. Nonylphenol absorbed through the newts’ skin is especially dangerous because it can result in issues with the reproductive biology as well as cutaneous and osmoregulatory mechanisms.|$|E
50|$|On 13 August 2008, the Swedish {{newspaper}} Göteborg Posten (sv) reported finding {{high levels}} of the environmental estrogen nonylphenol <b>ethoxylate</b> (NPE) in Björn Borg underwear.

50|$|Some {{of these}} {{stressors}} and stimulus {{that must be}} neutralized come from {{the environment of the}} Italian crested newt. T. carnifex lives in an open aquatic environment relatively close to human activity, which makes it prone to sewage leakages. It is noted that the absorption of the direct environment is a daily part of T. carnifexs life. This being said, it is clear that should there be toxins in the aquatic environment of the newt, it is highly likely and probably guaranteed that they will be absorbed into the body of T. carnifex. Chemicals such as nonlyphenol and <b>ethoxylate,</b> which are endocrine disruptors, are two of many found in the newts environments, and are considered the most toxic when transformed by microorganisms. This presents a very clear and present problem, because once these chemicals enter the skin, they become integrated into the newt’s bodily functions and can cause great harm to the animal. Because T. carnifex osmoregulates mostly through transepithelial movement of water and solutes, this is probably the largest physiological challenge faced by the newt.|$|E

In contrast, <b>ethoxylates</b> of alcohols derived from linear olefins undergo initial attack which results in scission of the linear alkyl chain from the polyoxyethylene chain with rapid biodegradation of the hydrophobe to C 02 and H 20 accompanied by slower degradation of the polyoxyethylene chain.

40|$|A {{strain of}} Pseudomonas putida {{isolated}} from activated sewage grew aerobically on the xenoestrogen precursor, nonylphenol polyethoxylate (NPEOx, where x {{is the number}} of <b>ethoxylate</b> units) as sole carbon source. Comparative growth yields on NPEOav 6, NPEOav 9, and NPEOav 20 (mixtures with average <b>ethoxylate</b> numbers as indicated) were consistent with utilization of all but two <b>ethoxylate</b> units, and the final accumulating metabolite was identified by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy as nonylphenol diethoxylate (NPEO 2). There was no growth on nonylphenol or polyethylene glycols, and there was no evidence for production of carboxylic acid analogs of NPEOx. Biodegradation kinetics measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) for each component in NPEOx mixtures showed that biodegradation proceeded via successive exoscission of the <b>ethoxylate</b> chain and not by direct scission between the second and third <b>ethoxylate</b> residues. The NPEOx-degrading activity was inducible by substrate, and cell extracts of NPEOav 9 -induced cells were also active on the pure alcohol <b>ethoxylate,</b> dodecyl octaethoxylate (AEO 8), producing sequentially, under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions, AEO 7, AEO 6, AEO 5, etc., thus demonstrating that the pathway involved removal of single <b>ethoxylate</b> units. HPLC analysis of 2, 4 -dinitrophenylhydrazone derivatives revealed acetaldehyde (ethanal) as the sole aldehydic product from either NPEOav 9 or AEO 8 under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions.

40|$|Waxes {{have many}} {{potential}} uses but large-scale application is hampered by their virtual insolubility. By grafting the wax with a polyethylene glycol segment {{to form an}} alcohol <b>ethoxylate,</b> the solubility of the wax in commercial solvents is significantly increased. Alcohol ethoxylates are produced by the polymerisation addition of ethylene oxide onto an oxidised wax. Current methods of alcohol <b>ethoxylate</b> production from alcohols lead to wide ethylene oxide addition distribution and large quantities of residual alcohol. The objective {{of this study is}} to provide a method for narrowing the ethylene oxide distribution and to reduce the residual alcohol content. It is proposed to concentrate the alcohol <b>ethoxylate</b> in a post-production separation process using supercritical fluid extraction. The system is modelled to contain three pseudo-components: an alkane, an alcohol and an alcohol <b>ethoxylate.</b> Propane is selected as the supercritical solvent of choice due to the large solubility difference between the alkane and polyethylene glycol. Lower molecular weight alkane phase equilibrium data with propane is abundant but extrapolation to higher molecular weights requires further investigation as it may be complicated by molecular folding. Molecular folding occurs in crystalline polyethylene and high molecular weight normal alkanes but information regarding molecular folding in solution is inconclusive. A model is proposed for molecular folding of normal alkanes in supercritical solution. A high molecular weight alkane mixture is synthesised and phase equilibrium measurement with propane are conducted. A lower molecular weight alkane mixture is used to prove the application of the principle of congruency to high-pressure phase equilibria. In the high wax mass fraction region the measurements are between the no-folding and once-folded relationship, indicating the possibility of partial molecular folding. In the mixture critical and low wax mass fraction region the measurements are similar to the non-folding relationship. Molecular folding in solution is thus dependent on the solution concentration. No phase equilibria measurements exist for propane with either high molecular weight alcohols or alcohol ethoxylates. Measurements of propane with an alcohol mixture show total solubility below 140 barA for temperatures up to 408 K. Measurements of propane with an alcohol <b>ethoxylate</b> at temperatures between 378 and 408 K shows that for an alcohol <b>ethoxylate</b> mass fraction between 0. 025 and 0. 5 pressures greater than 275 barA are required for solubilisation. When comparing the solubility of the three pseudo-components, the alkane is the most soluble followed by the alcohol. The alcohol <b>ethoxylate</b> is the least soluble. A counter-current supercritical extraction process is proposed for the concentration of the alcohol <b>ethoxylate.</b> Pilot plant tests were conducted and the proposed set-up shows good separation. An estimate of the energy requirements shows that heating and cooling constitute the majority of the energy required but with the use of heat integration it can be reduced by approximately 33 %. This work thus shows that the proposed process is both technically and economically viable. Although this work has provided a method for concentrating the alcohol <b>ethoxylate,</b> the process has not been optimised yet and future work includes the fine-tuning of this process...|$|E
