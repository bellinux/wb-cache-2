The main problem with leak signals is the low signal to noise ratio. One of the acoustic signals associated with gas escaping through a leak is only temporary and {{is in the form of}} a rarefaction wave originating when the leak is formed. Due to pipeline friction, over distance such a step function transitions to a ramp function.

In doing so, it analyses the effects of increasing the number of pipelines, reducing gas extraction costs and stabilising greenhouse gas concentrations. In the B 2 scenario, interregional gas transport by pipeline would increase from 150 bcm (billion cubic metres) in 1998 to nearly 900 bcm in 2040 whereas the interregional liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade would decrease over the same period. In addition, connecting the natural gas supply areas in the Former Soviet Union and the Middle East with the demand centres in South and Central Asia would increase global piped gas exports to around 1780 bcm. Reducing extraction costs or stabilising greenhouse gas concentrations would not alter this picture drastically. Although less than under a coal based scenario, carbon emissions would still increase under the B 2 scenario, especially when gas extraction costs decrease.

40|$|In Wyoming and {{throughout}} the United States, there are natural gas fields that are not producing because of their remoteness from gas pipelines. Some of these fields are ideal candidates for a cogeneration scheme where components suitable for chemical feedstock or direct use, such as propane and butane, are separated. Resulting low- to medium-Btu gas is fired in a gas turbine system to provide power for the separation plant. Excess power is sold to the utility, making the integrated plant a true cogeneration facility. This project seeks to identify the appropriate technologies for various subsystems of an integrated plant to recover value-added products from wet gas and/or retrograde condensate reservoirs. Various vendors and equipment manufacturers will be contacted and a data base consisting of feedstock constraints and output specifications for various subsystems and components will be developed. Based on vendor specifications, gas reservoirs suited for value-added product recovery will be identified. A candidate reservoir will then be selected, and an optimum plant layout will be developed. A facility will then be constructed and operated. The project consists of eight subtasks: Compilation of Reservoir Data; Review of Treatment and Conditioning Technologies; Review of Product Recovery and Separation Technologies; Development of Power Generation System; Integrated Plant Design for Candidate Field; System Fabrication; System Operation and Monitoring; and Economic Evaluation and Reporting. The first five tasks have been completed and the sixth is nearly complete. Systems Operations and Monitoring will start next year. The Economic Evaluation and Reporting task will be a continuous effort for the entire project. The reservoir selected for the initial demonstration of the process is the Burnt Wagon Field, Natrona County, Wyoming. The field is in a remote location with no electric power to the area and no <b>gas</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>line.</b> The design for the gas processing train to produce the liquefied gas products includes three gas compressors, a cryogenic separation unit, and a natural gas powered generator.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to remove water content in {{untreated}} natural gas using solid desiccant dehydration unit. Dehydration of natural gas is needed to remove the water that is associated with natural gases in vapor form. The natural gas industry has recognized that dehydration is necessary to ensure smooth operation of <b>gas</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>lines.</b> Dehydration prevents the formation of gas hydrates and reduces corrosion. Unless gases are dehydrated, liquid water may condense in pipelines and accumulate at low points along the line and reducing its flow capacity. Several methods have been developed to dehydrate gases on an industrial scale. The three major methods of dehydration are direct cooling, adsorption, and absorption. In this experiment, the adsorption process was choosing. Silica gel was the desiccants used in adsorption processes. The desiccant dehydration is a very simple process, ideal for remote locations with limited utilities, environment benefit, easy to install and operate and it also suitable in laboratory scale. In this study, it focuses on designing, fabrication, hydrostatic test and experimental part. On the experimental part, the quality of the desiccant and the temperature is constant because it only focuses on operating pressure. At a constant temperature the water content of the gas decreases with increasing pressure, thus less water must be removed if the gas is dehydrated at a high pressure...|$|R

The high GIL power ratings with very low power losses would allow a strong and highly efficient energy exchange particularly useful for the future European Market and could represent a new fundamental step in reconstructing the European interconnection network. Two separate railway tunnels (9. 6 m) will run under the Brenner Pass from Fortezza (Italy) to Innsbruck (Austria) but will be preceded by the construction of a continuous pilot tunnel (4. 3 m) useful for work logistics and chiefly for detection of the rock stratigraphy. Once the whole work will be over, the pilot tunnel will be used as a service gallery (drainage of water) where a double-circuit GIL can efficiently be installed. The paper gives the main characteristics of planned galleries, several details on the <b>transmission</b> <b>line</b> and its performance, the electro-magnetic field impact considering the proximity effects and the earthing arrangement in order to zero the touch-voltages in case of phase-to-enclosure short-circuits. The chief features of GIL solution are the lowest transmission power losses and the absence of shunt reactive compensation for this line length (appr. 65 km) but mostly the safety of personnel in case of short-circuit and the possibility of usual re-closure cycles for operation continuity. This paper gives an overview of other analysis: GIL no-load regime, electromagnetic interferences between railway and GIL system, pilot tunnel ventilation and GIL thermal regime.

3000|$|Way {{back in the}} 1930 s, {{natural gas}} {{hydrates}} were discovered in <b>gas</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>lines,</b> frequently at temperatures above the ice point. Many chloride salts, methanol, and monoethylene glycol are considered for hydrate inhibition in pipelines, but the hydrate problem in pipelines is still growing with the deep offshore production, increase in water cuts, and existence of multicomponent flow. Uneconomic thermodynamic inhibitors {{have been replaced by}} low dosage hydrate inhibitors (LDHI). In the hydrocarbon industry, emulsions can be encountered in almost all phases of oil and gas production, inside the reservoirs, well bores, and well heads and in transportation through pipelines. Irrespective of the amount of water in the emulsified system, hydrates could form in the emulsion at particular pressure and temperature conditions, which consequently leads to plugging of pipelines due to agglomeration of the hydrate particles into a large mass (Greaves et al. 2008; Mu et al. 2014). In more stable emulsions, there is a higher rate of hydrate formation as small droplets increase the surface area of contact between gas and water. In the oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion, the large surface contact between water and gas allows maximum mass transfer which increases the gas consumption rate (Douglas et al. 2009; Xiang et al. 2013). Talatori and Barth (2011) found that the nucleation time for methane gas hydrate formation depended inversely on the driving force, i.e., subcooling at a constant water cut and expectedly, the nucleation time decreased when the water cut increased at a constant temperature [...]...|$|R
