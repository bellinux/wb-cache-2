40|$|Surgical and radiologic {{techniques}} from {{computed tomography}} (CT) scanning and embolization to temporary gauze packing and mesh <b>hepatorrhaphy</b> {{have been developed}} to make the management of severe liver injuries more effective. Surgical approaches for severe liver trauma have been oriented to two major consequences of these injuries: hemorrhage and infection. Early attempts at hemorrhagic control found benefit only in temporary intrahepatic gauze packing. The subsequent recognition of complications after liver injury blamed the practice of packing, which then remained unused for more than 30 years. Yet more aggressive attempts at controlling hemorrhage without temporary packing failed to improve results. Temporary perihepatic gauze packing therefore has been reintroduced, but this is probably an imperfect solution. Mesh <b>hepatorrhaphy</b> may control bleeding without many of the adverse effects of packing. Fourteen patients are reported with severe liver injuries who have undergone mesh <b>hepatorrhaphy,</b> bringing the current reported experience with mesh <b>hepatorrhaphy</b> to 24, with a combined mortality rate of 37. 5 %. Thus far, it appears that only juxtacaval injuries fail to have their hemorrhage controlled with mesh <b>hepatorrhaphy,</b> but many believe that these injuries may be controlled by perihepatic packing. Prophylactic drainage of severe liver injuries is a concept for which there is little evidence of benefit. Furthermore, recent radiologic developments appear capable of draining those collections that do occasionally develop in the postoperative period. The ultimate challenge of liver transplantation for trauma has been attempted, but the experience is thus far very limited...|$|E

40|$|The liver is {{the most}} {{commonly}} injured abdominal organ. Severe hepatic trauma continue {{to be associated with}} high mortality. Management of liver injuries has changed significantly over the last two decades. Nonoperative management of hemodynamically stable patients has become the first treatment of choice. In unstable patients immediate control of bleeding is critical. In the management of severe injuries of the liver, particularly for patients who had developed a metabolic insult (hypothermia, coagulopathy, and acidosis), perihepatic packing has emerged as the key to effective damage control (DCS). The surgical aim is control of hemorrhage, preservation of sufficient hepatic function and prevention of secondary complications. Currently available surgical methods include <b>hepatorrhaphy,</b> resectional debridement, anatomical / nonanatomical resection, selective hepatic artery ligation, Pringle maneuver, total vascular exclusion, liver transplatation. This review discusses available diagnostic modalities and the best management options for liver injury, based on literature search and authors experience...|$|E
40|$|Objective : to {{evaluate}} the epidemiological variables and diagnostic and therapeutic modalities related to hepatic trauma patients undergoing laparotomy in a public referral hospital in the metropolitan region of Vitória-ES. Methods : we conducted a retrospective study, reviewing charts of trauma patients with liver injuries, whether isolated or in association with other organs, who underwent exploratory laparotomy, from January 2011 to December 2013. Results : We studied 392 patients, 107 of these with liver injury. The male: female ratio was 6. 6 : 1 and the mean age was 30. 12 years. Penetrating liver trauma occurred in 78. 5 % of patients, mostly with firearms. Associated injuries occurred in 86 % of cases and intra-abdominal injuries were more common in penetrating trauma (p < 0. 01). The most commonly used operative technique was <b>hepatorrhaphy</b> and damage control surgery was applied in 6. 5 % of patients. The average amounts of blood products used were 6. 07 units of {{packed red blood cells}} and 3. 01 units of fresh frozen plasma. The incidence of postoperative complications was 29. 9 %, the most frequent being infectious, including pneumonia, peritonitis and intra-abdominal abscess. The survival rate of patients suffering from blunt trauma was 60 %, and penetrating trauma, 87. 5 % (p < 0. 05).

40|$|Se presenta a un paciente de 37 años de edad que acude a nuestro Cuerpo de Guardia politraumatizado, con lesiones torácicas y abdominales, con síntomas y signos sugestivos de fracturas costales múltiples, con hemotórax derecho y hemoperitoneo, corroborado imaginológicamente y en la punción abdominal. Se realiza pleurostomía mínima {{intermedia}} y laparotomía exploratoria. Se le encuentran lesiones hepáticas de los segmentos VI, V, VIII y IV, con una profundidad mayor de 3 cm, además, deserosamientos en las asas delgadas intestinales y colon. Se realiza hepatorrafia y empaquetamiento hepático. Posteriormente van apareciendo complicaciones, por lo que tiene que ser reintervenido en más de 60 ocasiones. Entre ellas, la aparición de una fístula de alto gasto, que lo llevó a la desnutrición y a la permanencia con el abdomen expuesto durante 7 meses hasta el egreso. Se revisa la literatura correspondiente a estas entidades. A 37 years-old multi-traumatized male patient went to our emergency service.

Minimal intermediate pleurostomy and exploratory laparoscopy were performed. We found hepatic lesions in the 6 th, 5 th, 8 th and 4 th segments, over 3 cm deep; additionally, the loss of serosa from the intestinal ansae and from the colon. <b>Hepatorrhaphy</b> and hepatic packing were also performed. Later on, more complications appeared, {{so he had to}} be re-operated more than 60 times.

40|$|Aim. To {{provide a}} {{retrospective}} analysis of our results and experience in primary surgical treatment of subjects with war liver injuries. Methods. From July 1991 to December 1999, 204 subjects with war liver injuries were treated. A total of 82. 8 % of the injured were with the liver injuries combined with the injuries of other organs. In 93. 7 %, the injuries were caused by fragments of explosive devices or bullets of various calibers. In 140 (68. 6 %) of the injured there were minor lesions (grade I to II), treated with simple repair or drainage. There were complex injuries of the liver (grade III-V) in 64 (31. 4 %) of the injured. Those injuries required complex repair (<b>hepatorrhaphy,</b> hepatotomy, resection debridement, resection, packing alone). The technique of perihepatic packing and planned reoperation had a crucial and life-saving role when severe bleeding was present. Routine peritoneal drainage was applied {{in all of the}} injured. Primary management of 74. 0 % of the injured was performed in war hospitals. Results. After primary treatment, 72 (35. 3 %) of the injured were with postoperative complications. Reoperation was done in 66 injured. Total mortality rate in 204 injured was 18. 1 %. All the deceased had significant combined injuries. Mortality rates due to the liver injury of the grade III, IV and V were 16. 6 %, 70. 0 % and 83. 3 %, respectively. Conclusion. Complex liver injuries caused very high mortality rate and the management of the injured was delicate under war circumstances (if the injured reached the hospital alive). Our experience under war circumstances and with war surgeons of limited knowledge of the liver surgery and war surgery, confirmed that it was necessary to apply compressive abdominal packing alone or in combination with other techniques for hemostasis in the treatment of liver injuries grade III-V, resuscitation and rapid transportation to specialized hospitals...|$|E
40|$|O tratamento e a morbimortalidade dos pacientes com traumatismo hepático dependem do mecanismo da lesão e da conduta terapêutica, que inclui acompanhamento clínico, hepatorrafia, omentoplastia e próteses. O presente trabalho avaliou a recuperação hepática em presença de omentoplastia após lesão cortante do fígado de cão. Foram utilizados 15 cães machos, mestiços, com peso variando entre 7 kg e 12 kg, anestesiados com pentabarbitúrico endovenoso e submetidos a corte {{longitudinal}} no lobo esquerdo, medindo 2, 5 cm de profundidade e 8 cm de comprimento. Os animais foram divididos em três grupos (n= 5) : I- sem sutura (controle); II- sutura hepática apenas; III- sutura hepática com omentoplastia. O fio utilizado foi o categute cromado 4 - 0. Todos os animais do grupo I morreram no pós-operatório imediato, enquanto os cães dos grupos II e III suportaram bem os 28 dias de acompanhamento. À relaparotomia dos grupos II e III, encontraram-se múltiplas aderências ao fígado, que apresentou aspecto normal. No grupo III, o omento introduzido no ferimento hepático havia sido expulso e estava apenas aderido à cápsula do fígado macroscopicamente normal. À microscopia houve descontinuidade vascular e biliar entre os segmentos proximal e distal à hepatotomia. Os fenômenos cicatriciais foram mais exuberantes no grupo III, no qual se encontraram pequenas áreas do parênquima contendo fragmentos de omento. Concluindo, a omentoplastia facilitou o procedimento de reparo hepático, que, entretanto, não restabeleceu a contigüidade de vasos e ductos biliares. The {{treatment and}} the morbimortality of hepatic trauma {{depend on the}} mechanism of injury and therapeutical approach that includes clinical follow-up, <b>hepatorrhaphy,</b> omentoplasty and prosthesis. The present paper assessed the hepatic recoverance after hepatorraphy and omentoplasty for treatment of liver incision in dog. Fifteen male mongrel dogs weighing between 7 and 12 kg, were used. Under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia (10 mg/kg), the animals were submitted to a 2. 5 cm deep and 8 cm long incision of the left liver lobe. The dogs were divided into three groups: 1 - without repair (control); II- only hepatic suture; III- hepatic suture and omentoplasty. The two repairs were performed with 4 - 0 chromic catgut thread. All animals of group I died during the early postoperative period. The dogs of the groups II and III supported the 28 day-follow-up without problem. At the relaparotomy of the groups II and III multiple adhesions to an aparently normal liver were found. In the Group III, the omentum introduced in the hepatic wound was expulsed and remained attached to the liver capsule. At microscopy, it was observed discontinuity of vessels and biliary ducts at the leveI of liver scar; the intensity of inflammatory phenomenon was {{more important in the}} Group III. Little sections of omental tissue were found inside the parenchima. In conclusion the omentoplasty helped the liver suture, but did not prevent the interruption of vessels and bile ducts...|$|E
