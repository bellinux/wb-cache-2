5|$|The {{superior}} parathyroid glands {{receive their}} {{blood from the}} <b>inferior</b> thyroid arteries. The <b>inferior</b> parathyroid glands receive a variable blood supply, from either the ascending branch of the <b>inferior</b> thyroid arteries or the thyroid ima artery. The <b>inferior</b> thyroid artery arises from the subclavian arteries.|$|E
5|$|Each {{parathyroid}} vein drains {{into the}} superior, middle and <b>inferior</b> thyroid veins. The superior and middle thyroid veins drain into the internal jugular vein, and the <b>inferior</b> thyroid vein drains into the brachiocephalic vein.|$|E
5|$|The thyroid is {{supplied}} with arterial {{blood from the}} superior thyroid artery, {{a branch of the}} external carotid artery, and the <b>inferior</b> thyroid artery, a branch of the thyrocervical trunk, and sometimes by an anatomical variant the thyroid ima artery, which has a variable origin. The superior thyroid artery splits into anterior and posterior branches supplying the thyroid, and the <b>inferior</b> thyroid artery splits into superior and <b>inferior</b> branches. The superior and <b>inferior</b> thyroid arteries join together behind the outer part of the thyroid lobes. The venous blood is drained via superior and middle thyroid veins, which drain to the internal jugular vein, and via the <b>inferior</b> thyroid veins. The <b>inferior</b> thyroid veins originate in a network of veins and drain into the left and right brachiocephalic veins. Both arteries and veins form a plexus between the two layers of the capsule of the thyroid gland.|$|E

The <b>inferiors</b> are pale within, blackish-brown externally. In the related species, Copera marginipes, the appendages are pale yellow to white. The superiors are half the length of segment 10 and <b>inferiors</b> are {{at least four times}} the length of superiors. The <b>inferiors</b> tipped with black beneath.|$|R

5|$|Connecting the {{cerebellum}} {{to different}} parts of the nervous system are three paired cerebellar peduncles. These are the superior cerebellar peduncle, the middle cerebellar peduncle and the <b>inferior</b> cerebellar peduncle, named by their position relative to the vermis. The superior cerebellar peduncle is mainly an output to the cerebral cortex, carrying efferent fibers via thalamic nuclei to upper motor neurons in the cerebral cortex. The fibers arise from the deep cerebellar nuclei. The middle cerebellar peduncle is connected to the pons and receives all of its input from the pons mainly from the pontine nuclei. The input to the pons is from the cerebral cortex and is relayed from the pontine nuclei via transverse pontine fibers to the cerebellum. The middle peduncle is the largest of the three and its afferent fibers are grouped into three separate fascicles taking their inputs to {{different parts of}} the cerebellum. The <b>inferior</b> cerebellar peduncle receives input from afferent fibers from the vestibular nuclei, spinal cord and the tegmentum. Output from the <b>inferior</b> peduncle is via efferent fibers to the vestibular nuclei and the reticular formation. The whole of the cerebellum receives modulatory input from the <b>inferior</b> olivary nucleus via the <b>inferior</b> cerebellar peduncle.|$|E

5|$|In roughly 1 out {{of every}} 100200people, the right <b>inferior</b> {{laryngeal}} nerve is nonrecurrent, branching off the vagus nerve around {{the level of the}} cricoid cartilage. Typically, such a configuration is accompanied by variation in the arrangement of the major arteries in the chest; most commonly, the right subclavian artery arises from {{the left side of the}} aorta and crosses behind the esophagus. A left nonrecurrent <b>inferior</b> laryngeal nerve is even more uncommon, requiring the aortic arch be on the right side, accompanied by an arterial variant which prevents the nerve from being drawn into the chest by the left subclavian.|$|E

5|$|Parathyroid glands share {{a similar}} blood supply, venous {{drainage}}, and lymphatic drainage to the thyroid glands. Parathyroid glands {{are derived from}} the epithelial lining of {{the third and fourth}} branchial pouches, with the superior glands arising from the fourth pouch, and the <b>inferior</b> glands arising from the higher third pouch. The relative position of the <b>inferior</b> and superior glands, which are named according to their final location, changes because of the migration of embryological tissues.|$|E

50|$|The {{advantage}} of the top-down principle is that political and administrative responsibilities are clearly distinguished from each other, and that responsibility for political failures can be clearly identified with the relevant office holder.

5|$|Roger Sale {{believes}} Andersen {{expressed his}} feelings {{of social and}} sexual inferiority by creating characters that are <b>inferior</b> to their beloveds. The Little Mermaid, for example, has no soul while her human beloved has a soul as his birthright. In “Thumbelina”, Andersen suggests the toad, the beetle, and the mole are Thumbelina’s inferiors and should remain in their places rather than wanting their superior. Sale indicates they are not <b>inferior</b> to Thumbelina but simply different. He suggests that Andersen may have done some damage to the animal world when he colored his animal characters with his own feelings of inferiority.|$|E
