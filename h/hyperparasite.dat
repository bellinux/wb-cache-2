50|$|These wasps form an {{important}} role in the ecosystem, with more than 20 known species that are parasitoids, inquilines, and <b>hyperparasites</b> that live on its life cycle, while the galls form a persistent shelter for various forms of fungi as well as many other insects. Several birds are also known to feed from the galls and their inhabitants.|$|R
40|$|Coevolution between ant {{colonies and}} their rare {{specialized}} parasites are intriguing, because lethal infections of workers may correspond to tolerable chronic diseases of colonies, but the parasite adaptations that allow stable coexistence with ants are virtually unknown. We explore the trade-offs experienced by Ophiocordyceps parasites manipulating ants into dying in nearby graveyards. We used field data from Brazil and Thailand to parameterize and fit {{a model for}} the growth rate of graveyards. We show that parasite pressure is much lower than the abundance of ant cadavers suggests and that <b>hyperparasites</b> often castrate Ophiocordyceps. However, once fruiting bodies become sexually mature they appear robust. Such parasite life-history traits are consistent with iteroparity – a reproductive strategy rarely considered in fungi. We discuss how tropical habitats with high biodiversity of <b>hyperparasites</b> and high spore mortality has likely been crucial for the evolution and maintenance of iteroparity in parasites with low dispersal potential...|$|R
50|$|Microsporidia can infect {{a variety}} of hosts, {{including}} hosts which are themselves parasites. In that case, the microsporidian species is an <b>hyperparasite,</b> i.e. a parasite of a parasite. As an example, more than eighteen species are known which parasitize digeneans (parasitic flatworms). These digeneans are themselves parasites in various vertebrates and molluscs. Eight of these species belong to the genus Nosema.|$|E

50|$|The {{density of}} {{infected}} ants and graveyards of dead ants are numerous and {{spread throughout the}} surrounding area of the colony. Even though O. unilateralis is very virulent, only about 6.5% of all fruiting bodies are viable spore-producers. This {{is caused by the}} castration of the fungus by the <b>hyperparasite,</b> which may cause the limiting of the viable infectious spores. Ants also groom each other to combat microscopic organisms that could potentially harm the colony. This shows that the colony is not in as much danger as previously thought. Additional fungi grant beneficial assistance to the colony as well.|$|E
40|$|The natural {{occurrence}} of Ampelomyces <b>hyperparasites</b> was determined in Uncinula necator cleistothecia in nine south-western vineyards of Hungary between 1997 - 2000. During this study, {{a total of}} 1600 grape leaf samples were collected and examined from seven grapevine cultivars. The results showed that Ampelomyces spp. were widespread in that area and parasitized 0 - 55. 7 % (mean: 8. 3 %) of the cleistothecia on the adaxial surface of the leaves and only 0 - 4. 8 % (mean: 0. 8 %) on the abaxial leaf surfaces. The incidence of Ampelomyces in U. necator cleistothecia was the highest on the leaves covered more than 60 % with powdery mildew mycelia. The results suggested that the naturally occurring Ampelomyces <b>hyperparasites</b> {{play a role in}} the natural control of grapevine powdery mildew and may reduce the overwintering inoculum of U. necator in the studied area...|$|R
40|$|Investigations {{were carried}} out on the {{seasonal}} changes of aphids, particularly Myzus persicae (Sulz.), on hrussels sprouts {{and the importance of}} their natural enemies, from autumn 1968 to spring 1971 in the area around Edinburgh. M. persicae overwintered anholocyclically on weeds, particularly on dock plants, hut rarely on brassica crops. Plants in glasshouses also provided overwintering sites for M. persicae and Macrosiphum euphorbiae (Thomas). These aphids started gradually to infest the brussels sprout plants during the end of June in a constant but irregular movement. Both M. persicae and M. euphorbiae have no fixed patterns of population changes throughout the field nor from year to year. During early July the initially low densities of M. persicae and M. euphorbiae populations increased fast. By early August parasitism and predation increased; condensation of water droplets on the aphids also appeared in August and drowned some of them. Subsequently these mortality factors caused a sharp decline of the first peak of M. persicae abundance, and complete disappearance of H. euphorbiae from the field by mid-September. Favourable weather and reduced activities of natural enemies caused another peak of M. persicae to be reached in September. A slight drop in abundance occurred again, due mainly to parasitism; the third and last peak of a season appeared during late October and early November. The fall of this peak was attributed to the cold weather which reduced the rate of reproduction and hastened the abscission of bottom leaves which carried the aphid population. Eighteen species in eight genera of aphid parasites and at least eight species in five genera of <b>hyperparasites</b> were recorded. All the eleven species of primary parasites and five genera containing at least eight species of <b>hyperparasites</b> noted as parasites of M. persioae; and fifteen species of primary parasites and five genera of at least eight species of the <b>hyperparasites</b> listed tinder M. euphorbias were first records of any such parasites in Scotland. The M. persicae records as aphid host of seven species of primary parasites and two genera of at least three species of hyperparasites; and M. euphorbiae also as an aphid host of seven species of primary parasites and two genera of at least four species of <b>hyperparasites</b> were new records in Britain. Three and four species of primary parasites listed respectively under M, persicae and M. euphorbiae as aphid host were found to he new records in the general literature. Praon volucre (Hal.) was the dominant species of the primary parasites followed by Diaeretiella rapae Mcintosh and Aphidius picipes (Hees) which were about half and one third as numerous as the dominat species. Asaphes vulgaris Walker was the dominant species of the <b>hyperparasites</b> with cynipids about equally abundant. Some aspects of the bionomics of <b>hyperparasites</b> and primary parasites, particularly P. volucre, were given. Factors which limited the effectiveness of the parasites, particularly P. volucre, included 1. the fast developmental rate and the lower threshold of the aphid host (M, persicae) as compared to that of thep parasite (P. volucre). 2. hyperparasitism; - in 1969 and 1970 aphids on brussels sprouts were hyperparasitised respectively to the extent of 39. 4...|$|R
50|$|As well as {{providing}} food and protection to the wasp larvae, the galls provide shelter for several inquiline species of gall wasp including Synergus gallaepomiformis and Synergus umbraculus.

50|$|While {{other black}} ants such as Lasius niger, the smaller {{but much more}} common (in the UK) species, a queen founds its own nest by laying eggs and then feeding the new larvae with a fluid {{produced}} by breaking down its own muscles; a process that leaves her terrible weak as she cannot tend the larvae and forage for food at the same time. A post-nuptial queen of Lasius fuliginosus cannot found her own nests, but establishes a nest through social parasitism in another species of the same genus - Lasius umbratus, a rare yellow ant with an underground habit (unlike the common yellow ant Lasius flavus which makes small mounds in grass and lawns). She kills or ousts the existing queen and lays eggs, which the existing workers tend. Her offspring workers then slowly take over the nest. Lasius umbratis also establishes its nest in a similar way, by taking over the nest of Lasius niger, the common black ant, so Lasius fuliginosus is {{sometimes referred to as}} a <b>hyperparasite.</b>|$|E
50|$|Common minke {{whales are}} a host {{to a number}} of {{internal}} and external parasites, as well as commensals, and other epibiotic fauna. Off Iceland, 45.2 per cent (85 of 188) of sampled minke whales bore old scars from attacks by the sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus, while a further 10.6 per cent had fresh scars on the posterior part of their flanks; five were found with live lampreys still clinging to their flesh. The copepod Caligus elongatus was found on 11.9 per cent of individuals, with a mean intensity (M.
