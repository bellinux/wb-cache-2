It becomes increasingly important to solve the problems of rural <b>electrical</b> <b>fire.</b> The southwest rural area of China, where fire situation is severe and fire accidents occur frequently, is chosen to be surveyed. The situation of rural electric circuits and the strength of fire rescue in southwest countryside of China are investigated, and the fire fatalness of wood houses and the potential perils of <b>electrical</b> <b>fire</b> in rural area are presented. Finally, some suggestions on <b>electrical</b> <b>fire</b> prevention in rural area are put forward...|$|R

40|$|Arc faults {{can produce}} very high {{temperatures}} and can easily ignite combustible materials; thus, they represent {{one of the}} most important causes of <b>electrical</b> <b>fires.</b> The application of arc fault detection, as an emerging early fire detection technology, is required by the National Electrical Code to reduce the occurrence of <b>electrical</b> <b>fires.</b> However, the concealment, randomness and diversity of arc faults make them difficult to detect. To improve the accuracy of arc fault detection, a novel arc fault detector (AFD) is developed in this study. First, an experimental arc fault platform is built to study <b>electrical</b> <b>fires.</b> A high-frequency transducer and a current transducer are used to measure typical load signals of arc faults and normal states. After the common features of these signals are studied, high-frequency energy and current variations are extracted as an input eigenvector for use by an arc fault detection algorithm. Then, the detection algorithm based on a weighted least squares support vector machine is designed and successfully applied in a microprocessor. Finally, an AFD is developed. The test results show that the AFD can detect arc faults in a timely manner and interrupt the circuit power supply before <b>electrical</b> <b>fires</b> can occur. The AFD is not influenced by cross talk or transient processes, and the detection accuracy is very high. Hence, the AFD can be installed in low-voltage circuits to monitor circuit states in real-time to facilitate the early detection of <b>electrical</b> <b>fires...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{makes an}} {{analysis}} of the essential reasons for a continuously high percentage of <b>electrical</b> <b>fire</b> occurrences in China. The analysis of the genesis of electric fires in the electric circuit is also described in the article. Based on the different genesis of electric fire in the electric circuit, different features, including short circuit, circuit overload, bad contact of the terminals, increasing of the contact resistance in the circuit, ageing and charging in the circuit and leakage current fault, are described in this paper. Corresponding methods of fire preventions & control to the different electric circuit faults are put out. With respect to different <b>electrical</b> <b>fire</b> genesis and features, an overall plan for <b>electrical</b> <b>fire</b> prevention & control in a low voltage distribution system is put forward here...|$|R

40|$|Although <b>electrical</b> <b>fires</b> {{constitute}} the greatest {{percentage of the}} main causes of building fires, the critical evidence used by fire investigators to identify <b>electrical</b> <b>fires</b> is not always convincing to the general public. In this study, we scrutinized the microstructures of fire-causing copper wires and simulated the external environmental conditions required {{for the formation of}} fire-causing arc beads. Our metallographic investigation revealed that the primary thermal dendrites of copper at the fire-causing arc bead grew parallel to one another, but in the opposite direction to the heat flow. We determined the relationships of the undercooling (∆T 0), the growth velocity (ν), and the primary spacing (λ) of the dendrites with respect to the electrical wire’s diameter. Accordingly, fire investigators can now identify fire-causing arc beads in terms of these metallographic characteristics, thereby providing clear scientific evidence for litigant judgments of <b>electrical</b> <b>fires...</b>|$|R

500|$|In {{this first}} set of letters Franklin talked about <b>electrical</b> <b>fire,</b> later (1749) {{changing}} the terminology to electrical fluid. He wrote to Collinson on June 5, 1747, that his experiments showed that the <b>electrical</b> <b>fire</b> was a new element of matter existing as particles in all ordinary matter. [...] Franklin determined that a friction rubbing process like that of rubbing glass with a cloth does not create these particles, but only temporararily groups them together {{so that they can}} be collected and held in a Leyden jar of water and metal. According to Franklin, one side of the Leyden jar had an accumulation of <b>electrical</b> <b>fire,</b> which he labeled as positive (plus), and the other side had a deficiency of <b>electrical</b> <b>fire,</b> labeled negative (minus). These losses and gains of electrification were exactly equal and are essentially the modern law of charge conservation except that it is now recognized that negative charges exist in their own right, not just as a deficiency of positive charges. It is an important principle in modern science that explains the microphysics of the electrification of gross bodies. In these letters, Franklin introduced technical words that we use today for things related to electricity such as plus, minus, positive, negative, charge, discharge, armature, electric shock, electrician, condenser, conductor, and battery.|$|R
