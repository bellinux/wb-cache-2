5000|$|British Morris and MG engines from 1923 to 1955 {{were built}} using <b>metric</b> <b>threads</b> but with bolt heads and nuts {{dimensioned}} for Whitworth spanners and sockets. In 1919 Morris Motors {{took over the}} French Hotchkiss engine works which had moved to Coventry during the First World War. The Hotchkiss machine tools were of <b>metric</b> <b>thread</b> but <b>metric</b> spanners were not readily available in Britain at the time, so fasteners were made with <b>metric</b> <b>thread</b> but Whitworth heads.|$|R

50|$|Stage {{lighting}} suspension bolts {{are most}} commonly 3/8 in and 1/2 in BSW. Companies that initially converted to <b>metric</b> <b>threads</b> have converted back, after complaints that the finer <b>metric</b> <b>threads</b> increased {{the time and}} difficulty of setup, which often {{takes place at the}} top of a ladder or scaffold.

50|$|The {{trapezoidal}} <b>metric</b> <b>thread</b> form {{is similar}} to the Acme thread form, except the thread angle is 30°. It is codified by DIN 103. Although <b>metric</b> screw <b>threads</b> are generally more prevalent worldwide than imperial threads, the Acme thread is very common worldwide, and may be more widely used than the trapezoidal <b>metric</b> <b>thread.</b> This is not surprising, as manufacturers today are usually capable of making whichever <b>threads</b> (<b>metric</b> or imperial) are best for any given application (based on customer expectations or tooling availability). It may be that the tooling for Acme threads has been so dominant (compared to trapezoidal metric) that customers tend to want Acme threads for power screws regardless of metric standards used elsewhere in the product.|$|R

50|$|They {{are held}} in place by screws, either UTS (now largely obsolete) or <b>metric</b> M3.5×0.6 <b>threads.</b> Early {{versions}} of the standard suggested that metric screws should be blackened to avoid confusion with the incompatible UTS threads. However, by the 1987 revision this was no longer considered necessary because of the prevalence of <b>metric</b> <b>threads.</b>|$|R

While <b>metric</b> screw <b>threads</b> are more prevalent worldwide than imperial threads for triangular thread forms, the imperially sized Acme threads predominate in the trapezoidal thread form. In some cases customers prefer Acme threads for power screws regardless of metric standards used elsewhere in the product.|$|R

5000|$|The design {{principles}} of ISO general-purpose <b>metric</b> screw <b>threads</b> ("M" [...] series threads) are defined in international standard ISO 68-1. Each thread {{is characterized by}} its major diameter, D (Dmaj in the diagram), and its pitch, P. ISO <b>metric</b> <b>threads</b> consist of a symmetric V-shaped thread. In {{the plane of the}} thread axis, the flanks of the V have an angle of 60° to each other. The thread depth is 0.614 × pitch. The outermost [...] and the innermost [...] of the height H of the V-shape are cut off from the profile.|$|R
50|$|However, internationally, {{the metric}} system was eclipsing inch-based {{measurement}} units. In 1947, ISO was founded; and in 1960, the metric-based International System of Units (abbreviated SI from the French Système International) was created. With continental Europe {{and much of}} the rest of the world turning to SI and ISO <b>metric</b> screw <b>thread,</b> the UK gradually leaned in the same direction. The ISO <b>metric</b> screw <b>thread</b> is now the standard that has been adopted worldwide and is slowly displacing all former standards, including UTS. In the U.S., where UTS is still prevalent, over 40% of products contain at least some ISO <b>metric</b> screw <b>threads.</b> The UK has completely abandoned its commitment to UTS in favour of ISO <b>metric</b> <b>threads,</b> and Canada is in between. Globalization of industries produces market pressure in favor of phasing out minority standards. A good example is the automotive industry; U.S. auto parts factories long ago developed the ability to conform to the ISO standards, and today very few parts for new cars retain inch-based sizes, regardless of being made in the U.S.|$|R
40|$|When {{a static}} {{cylindrical}} system {{is subjected to}} equal and opposite torques top and bottom it transports angular momentum along its axis. The <b>external</b> <b>metric</b> of this static system can be transformed to Levi-Civita's form by using helical coordinates. This gives the <b>external</b> <b>metric</b> of a static cylinder three dimensionless parameters corresponding to the mass per unit length, the total stress along the cylinder, and the total torque. The <b>external</b> vacuum <b>metric</b> of a spherical system is characterised by its mass alone. How many parameters characterise the <b>external</b> <b>metric</b> of a general stationary cylindrical system? Leaving aside the radius of the cylinder which defines the scale we find that there are five parameters, the three above mentioned, to which should be added the momentum along the cylinder per unit length and the angular momentum per unit length. We show how to transform Levi-Civita's one parameter metric to include all five. Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv: 1312. 604...|$|R

5000|$|During this era, in {{continental}} Europe, the British and American threadforms {{were well}} known, but also various <b>metric</b> <b>thread</b> standards were evolving, which usually employed 60° profiles. Some of these evolved into national or quasi-national standards. They were mostly unified in 1898 by the International Congress for the standardization of screw threads at Zurich, which defined {{the new international}} <b>metric</b> <b>thread</b> standards as having the same profile as the Sellers <b>thread,</b> but with <b>metric</b> sizes. Efforts {{were made in the}} early 20th century to convince the governments of the U.S., UK, and Canada to adopt these international thread standards and the metric system in general, but they were defeated with arguments that the capital cost of the necessary retooling would drive some firms from profit to loss and hamper the economy. (The mixed use of dueling inch and metric standards has since cost much, much more, but the bearing of these costs has been more distributed across national and global economies rather than being borne up front by particular governments or corporations, which helps explain the lobbying efforts.) ...|$|R
