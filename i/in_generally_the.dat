50|$|A {{cure for}} Werner {{syndrome}} {{has not yet}} been discovered. It is often treated by managing the associated diseases and relieving symptoms to improve quality of life. The skin ulcers that accompany WS can be treated in several ways, depending on the severity. Topical treatments can be used for minor ulcers, but are not effective in preventing new ulcers from occurring. In the most severe cases, surgery may be required to implant a skin graft or amputate a limb if necessary. Diseases commonly associated with Werner Syndrome such as diabetes and cancer are treated <b>in</b> <b>generally</b> <b>the</b> same ways as they would be for a non-Werner Syndrome individual. A change in diet & exercise can help prevent and control arteriosclerosis, and regular cancer screenings can allow for early detection of cancer.|$|E
50|$|The gearbox {{has shown}} to hold {{more power than}} the factory stated quite reliably. That being said a lower geared final drive helps {{eliminate}} excessive stress on the gears, thus the 3.82 FD (final drive) is weaker than the 4.05 and the now hard to source 4.45 gearset is the strongest. That being said it's not unbreakable in any configuration, especially with a fast spooling turbo to create a low end boost spike. The most common gear to break is third and commonly a boost ramp is tuned in to help save the stock transmission. The later the boost comes <b>in</b> <b>generally</b> <b>the</b> transmission will hold up better as it's not a sudden surge of power. Wheel hop is a killer of transmissions and axles creating excessive stress as the wheels load and unload.|$|E
5000|$|Caesar {{referred}} to the fort of the Eburones as Aduatuca, and {{this has led to}} a widely accepted proposal that this can be equated to Tongeren. There are counter arguments that the word [...] "Aduatuca" [...] was probably a general word for a fort in this region, meaning that there might have been more places with the same name, and that Tongeren shows no signs of pre-Roman occupation, nor the hilly terrain described by Caesar. There was also a distinct tribe in the area known as the Aduatuci. On the other hand, it has the same name and function as a local capital, and is <b>in</b> <b>generally</b> <b>the</b> right area. If it is not Tongeren itself, the Aduatuca of the Eburones might be the ancient fortification of Caestert in nearby Riemst.|$|E
