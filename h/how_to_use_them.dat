Noether showed how to exploit such conditions, however, to maximum advantage: for example, <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>them</b> to show that every set of sub-objects has a maximal/minimal element or that a complex object can be generated by a smaller number of elements. These conclusions often are crucial steps in a proof.|$|E
5|$|It was {{considered}} {{more likely that}} Germany might employ such weapons against the United Kingdom, so four officers from the European Theater of Operations United States Army (ETOUSA) were summoned to Chicago where {{they were given a}} top secret briefing by the Manhattan District's Chicago area engineer, Major Arthur V.

They were told about possible forms such an attack might take, and what the effects and symptoms of them were, and they were given survey instruments and shown <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>them.</b> They were enjoined to tell other officers in the theater to report unexplained fogging of film or illnesses with symptoms corresponding to the effects of radiation sickness.|$|E

The team's technical accomplishments included character and environment models composed completely of polygons and the absence of distance fog to obscure the draw distance.|$|E

The gunnery officer consulted his references to get the range and calculated the proper elevation and deflection required to hit the target. He then transmitted his commands via a Geisler electro-mechanical fire-control transmission system to each gun or turret. While fitting out, these rangefinders were replaced on the first four ships by two Barr and Stroud coincidence rangefinders that used two images {{that had to be}} superimposed to derive the range. Perepelkin telescopic sights were also installed for their guns, but their crews were not trained in <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

5|$|After the Square Enix merger, {{however, the}} {{individual}} teams still continued to program and customize their own tools for each game, which would eventually {{go to waste}} as only their respective creators knew <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>them.</b> With the amount of assets and tools required by the in-development Final Fantasy XII and the impending advent of the seventh console generation, a common data format for the company was proposed in 2004. It was to be developed in-house and replace general-purpose formats such as FBX and COLLADA. Realizing the goal of an engine with {{a common set of}} tools proved to be difficult, as many production teams wanted to further their own interests rather than those of the company as a whole. Select staff members from different company divisions teamed up to work on the project on a voluntary basis, but their loose organizational structure failed to yield results. Nevertheless, Murata considered this group effort a first step in the right direction. In 2005, he was appointed general manager of the newly formed Technology Division. Although this enabled Murata and his subordinates to talk about a company-wide engine more extensively, the lack of manpower again prevented any significant achievements.|$|E
