40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2001. The aim of {{this study}} is to analyse Hansard {{publications}} with regard to the language and grammatical contents thereof in a multilingual South Africa. Chapter 1 defines the problem and the purpose and relevance of the study as well as the field of research and the scope of the study. Chapter 2 provides the background and historical development of Hansard as a publication. This is followed by a discussion of the prevailing conventions and expectations of this publication and the political importance attached to it within South Africa as well as other countries of the world. Chapter 3 reviews translation theories formulated by various language experts, and considers the viability of these in relation to Hansard publications in South Africa. The impact of culture on this conventional verbatim publication is investigated and comparisons are drawn between the translations of the different South African languages. Consideration is given to how practical and feasible the verbatim convention of Hansard is in the written reproduction of political speeches in the <b>floor</b> <b>languages</b> used in the National Parliament and the nine Provincial Legislatures, as well as the expectation of verbatim translations of such speeches and debates. Chapter 4 provides an extensive number of examples and discussions of typical language and translation errors found in the different Hansard publications of South Africa. Chapter 5 analyses the editing techniques of the editors of Hansard publications and the accessibility to the readers of the end product. Chapter 6 provides the findings and conclusions and makes suggestions for a change in the conventional verbatim approach that is still followed -to the detriment of the end product -in the majority of the publications studied for this research project. This chapter also offers suggestions for further research that could be of benefit to this field of study. Doctora...|$|R

40|$|In {{the spring}} of 1989, Chrysler and Mitsubishi Motors entered a joint venture to build {{automobiles}} in Bloomington-Normal, Illinois. Production and maintenance workers at the joint venture Diamond Star plant approached their jobs with great anticipation. Now ten years after “lean production ” and “employee teams ” were introduced, this paper revisits the initial expectations of workers and through an employee survey assesses how employee attitudes, shop <b>floor</b> behavior and <b>language</b> have coalesced to create an oppositional discourse of dissent. At Mitsubishi {{there appears to be}} a fundamental contradiction between the discourse of production as spoken and the experiences of the workers working within that discourse. The tension between language and practice demands understanding and recognition; consequently, to meet those needs the workers have created their own way of talking about work life at Mitsubishi. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK In the last quarter of the 20 th Century the auto industry was enthusiastically encouraged to become “flexible, ” “empowering ” and “lean ” (Wolmack and Roos 1990). Unlike the Fordist days of command and control, corporate management auto executive...|$|R
40|$|The {{workshop}} {{for teachers of}} German as Foreign language in the Special Region of Yogyakarta and Central Java is intended to: (1) provided insight into the knowledge of German language teachers {{about the nature of}} literary text and its relevance to German as a foreign language, teaching and (2) trained German language teachers to develop teaching and learning German in high school that integrates literary text as an alternative form of active - creative teaching and learning. This workshop was held at the PLA Building III <b>Floor,</b> Faculty of <b>Languages</b> Faculty of Languages and Art UNY on Tuesday, July 6, 2010. The Workshop begins with the opening ceremony, followed by several presentations: (1) active - creative teaching and learning (2) Literature in language teaching, (3) use of German lyrik and poetry in German language teaching and (4) use of tale in German language teaching. After the presentations, the participants developed German language teaching designs by integrating the literary texts and than presented their works. This program was attended by 41 teachers of German from the Special Region of Yogyakarta and Central Java. From the observation is known that the German language teacher knowledge about literary texts increases and they able to develop learning activities that take advantage of German literary texts.

40|$|An immense {{degree of}} {{linguistic}} diversity {{exists in the}} work force where it is possible for speakers of twenty-three home languages to come into contact on the work <b>floor.</b> The <b>language</b> of management in industry is predominantly English; while supervisors are primarily English- or Afrikaans-speaking. Misinterpretation of speaker intent plays a significant role in communication breakdown that occurs when management or foremen/supervisors communicate directly with workers who do not understand the two erstwhile official languages sufficiently or not at all. Reagan (1 986) hypothesized that the greatest number of problems are caused by what might be termed mutual ignorance, rather than by language difficulties. The aim of the thesis was therefore to establish what constitutes the mutual ignorance that leads to misinterpretation of speaker intent. The Hymesian model, the ethnography of speaking, was used as a model for an analysis of sociolinguistic features in factories in the Pretoria-WitwatersrandVereeniging area. For data collection a process of triangulation was used and qualitative and quantitative methods used. The Free Attitude Interview technique was used for unstructured interviews. Other methods include observation, and elicitation procedures such as the Discourse Completion Test, which were used in structured interviews. Language preference, forms of address and politeness markers were examined. Findings revealed that the major differences were found to be in the area of non-verbal behaviour. Speakers of Afrikaans and English are, on the whole, unaware of politeness markers used by speakers of African languages. Afrikaans and English speakers are unaware of offensive non-verbal behaviour used by them. It is revealing that speakers of the official languages believe this to be the very area that makes communication possible, but it is the area in which they may cause offence. It was also found that speakers of African languages have adopted many of the features of the power dominant group at work. The findings of the research are important for the development of strategies for overcoming misinterpretation of speaker intent and negative stereotyping.
