40|$|Abstract: This paper {{introduces}} a new algorithm called “Adaptive Multimodal Biometric Fusion Algorithm”(AMBF), {{which is a}} combination of Bayesian decision fusion and particle swarm optimization. A Bayesian framework is implemented to fuse decisions received from multiple biometric sensors. The system’s accuracy improves for a subset of decision fusion rules. The optimal rule {{is a function of the}} error cost and a priori probability of an intruder. This Bayesian framework formalizes the design of a system that can adaptively increase or reduce the security level. Particle swarm optimization searches the decision and sensor operating points (i. <b>e.</b> <b>thresholds)</b> space to achieve the desired security level. The optimization function aims to minimize the cost in a Bayesian decision fusion. The particle swarm optimization algorithm results in the fusion rule and the operating points of sensors at which the system can work.

The adaptive algorithm is found to achieve desired security level and switch between different rules and sensor operating points for varying needs...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDiscriminating {{between two}} speed signals is harder {{when they are}} {{seen as part of}} a single trajectory, {{compared}} to the case when they appear as distinct entities. Observers were asked to judge which half of a display had dots that were moving faster. This was done under two main conditions: when dot motion appeared to continue across the boundary between the two halves, and when it moved parallel to the boundary. Speed discrimination thresholds were elevated when motion in the two halves appeared to cross the boundary compared to the case when motion was parallel to the boundary. Extensive practice improved performance until speed discrimination in the two cases was virtually indistinguishable. The addition of noise caused the original effect to reappear, i. <b>e.,</b> <b>thresholds</b> were elevated when motion continued across the border. Our results suggest that the local differences in velocity on either side of border are ignored when motion appears to cross the border. Instead the visual system seems to enforce an a priori assumption that when motion continues across a boundary it belongs to a common motion path...|$|R
40|$|Four {{algorithms}} {{have been}} developed to reconstruct 3 -D object points, all of which involve representation of the 3 -D wavefront by its zero-crossings on the hologram plane. The first algorithm discussed is the Randomly Selected Zero-Crossing (RSZC) algorithm. This straightforward approach involves randomly selecting the positions of the desired number of apertures on the hologram plane, and perturbing each one of them until they satisfy the zero-crossing criterion. A second approach, the Fast Weighted Zero-Crossing algorithm (FWZC), is devised to combat some problems inherent with the RSZC algorithm. It can be considered to be the generalization of the zero-crossing techniques discussed above, with a fast architecture and removal of saturation through selective choice (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>thresholding)</b> of zero-crossings. The final two algorithms, the Randomly Selected Zero-Crossing, Off Axis Plane Wave (RSZC-OPW) algorithm and the Fast Weighted Zero-Crossing, Off-Axis Plane Wave (FWZC-OPW) algorithm, are similar to the first two except that they are designed to be reconstructed with an off-axis (tilted) plane wave rather than a normally incident plane wave.
