5|$|This is the set {{of points}} in 3-{{dimension}}al Euclidean space found exactly one unit away from the origin. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> 2-sphere, S2, for reasons given below. The same idea applies for any dimension n; the equation x02 + x12 + ⋯ + x'n2 = 1 produces the n-sphere as a geometric object in (n + 1)-dimensional space. For example, the 1-sphere S1 is a circle.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} to self-contained breathing systems is to supply breathing gases {{from the surface}} through a hose. When combined with a communication cable, a pneumofathometer hose and a safety line <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> diver's umbilical, which may include a hot water hose for heating, video cable and breathing gas reclaim line. More basic equipment that uses only an air hose is called an airline or hookah system. This allows the diver to breathe using an air supply hose from a cylinder or compressor at the surface. Breathing gas is supplied through a mouth-held demand valve or light full-face mask. It is used for work such as hull cleaning and archaeological surveys, for shellfish harvesting, and as snuba, a shallow water activity typically practised by tourists {{and those who are}} not scuba-certified.|$|E
5|$|Every {{vector space}} has a basis. This follows from Zorn's lemma, an {{equivalent}} {{formulation of the}} Axiom of Choice. Given the other axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, the existence of bases {{is equivalent to the}} axiom of choice. The ultrafilter lemma, which is weaker than the axiom of choice, implies that all bases of a given vector space have the same number of elements, or cardinality (cf. Dimension theorem for vector spaces). <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> dimension of the vector space, denoted by dim V. If the space is spanned by finitely many vectors, the above statements can be proven without such fundamental input from set theory.|$|E

5|$|The Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of {{responsibility}} (AOR) begins at the boundary with the National Hurricane Center' AOR (at 140°W), and ends at the International Date Line, where the Northwestern Pacific begins. The hurricane season in the North Central Pacific runs annually from June 1 to November 30; The Central Pacific Hurricane Center monitors the storms that develop or move into the defined area {{of responsibility}}. The CPHC previously tasked with monitoring tropical activity in the basin was originally known as the Joint Hurricane Warning Center; today <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Joint Typhoon Warning Center.|$|E
5|$|The Inn {{is run by}} Pension, its {{ultimate}} governing body. The name is peculiar to Gray's Inn—at Lincoln's Inn the governing body is called the Council, and at the Inner and Middle Temples <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Parliament. The name {{was used for the}} governing bodies of three of the Inns of Chancery—Barnard's Inn, Clement's Inn and New Inn. In Gray's Inn the Readers, when they existed, were required to attend Pension meetings, and other barristers were at one point welcome to, although only the Readers would be allowed to speak. Pension at Gray's Inn is made up of the Masters of the Bench, and the Inn as a whole is headed by the Treasurer, a senior Bencher. The Treasurer has always been elected, and since 1744 the office has rotated between individuals, with a term of one year.|$|E
5|$|The River Slea {{rises to}} the west of Sleaford, near Ancaster, and flows in an easterly direction, passing through Sleaford on its way to South Kyme, beyond which <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Kyme Eau, joining the River Witham at Chapel Hill. Kyme Eau had been navigable since at least the reign of Edward III, for in 1375 Gilbert d'Umframville was accused of {{illegally}} collecting tolls on boats carrying food products to the people of Kesteven. He had been doing so for 12 years, and he defended his case before the king, explaining that the river was navigable from Dog Dyke to Brent Fen, but that it suffered from silting and the banks were in a poor state of repair. Having agreed to carry out repairs, he was granted the right to levy tolls by letters patent.|$|E
50|$|The Four Tours World Championship was {{an annual}} {{professional}} golf tournament that was played from 1985 to 1991. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> played between teams representing the four main professional tours: the American PGA Tour, the PGA European Tour, the PGA Tour of Australasia and the Japan Golf Tour. In 1985 and 1986 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Nissan Cup, in 1987 and 1988 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Kirin Cup while from 1989 to 1991 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Asahi Glass Four Tours World Championship.|$|R

5|$|The pallium is a {{layer of}} gray matter that lies {{on the surface of}} the {{forebrain}} and is the most complex and most recent evolutionary development of the brain as an organ. In reptiles and mammals, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> cerebral cortex. Multiple functions involve the pallium, including smell and spatial memory. In mammals, where it becomes so large as to dominate the brain, it takes over functions from many other brain areas. In many mammals, the cerebral cortex consists of folded bulges called gyri that create deep furrows or fissures called sulci. The folds increase the surface area of the cortex and therefore increase the amount of gray matter and the amount of information that can be stored and processed.|$|E
5|$|Varadharaja Perumal Temple, {{dedicated}} to Vishnu and covering , {{is the largest}} Vishnu temple in Kanchipuram. It was built by the Cholas in 1053 and was expanded during the reigns of Kulottunga Chola I (1079–1120) and Vikrama Chola (1118–1135). It {{is one of the}} divyadesams, the 108 holy abodes of Vishnu. The temple features carved lizards, one platted with gold and another with silver, over the sanctum.Clive of India is said to have presented an emerald necklace to the temple. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Clive Makarakandi and is still used to decorate the deity on ceremonial occasions.|$|E
5|$|Dew {{point is}} the {{temperature}} to which a given parcel of air must be cooled, at constant atmospheric pressure, for water vapor to condense into water. The condensed water is called dew. The dew point is a saturation point. When the dew point temperature falls below freezing <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> frost point, as the water vapor no longer creates dew but instead creates frost or hoarfrost by deposition. The dew point is associated with relative humidity. A high relative humidity indicates that the dew point {{is closer to the}} current air temperature. If the relative humidity is 100%, the dew point is equal to the current temperature. Given a constant dew point, an increase in temperature will lead to a decrease in relative humidity. At a given barometric pressure, independent of temperature, the dew point determines the specific humidity of the air. The dew point is an important statistic for general aviation pilots, as it is used to calculate the likelihood of carburetor icing and fog. When used with the air temperature, a formula can be used to estimate the height of cumuliform, or convective, clouds.|$|E

5|$|English cathedrals {{maintain}} a traditional form of church service, of which canticles, the set psalm of the day, responses, and an anthem are sung by a choir traditionally composed of about thirty men and boys. (Many cathedrals now {{also have a}} girls choir, and a lay choir). Because of this tradition, {{that part of the}} building that contains the stalls, usually to the east of the central tower but sometimes extending under <b>it,</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> choir or quire. The choir is sometimes divided from the nave of the cathedral by a wide medieval screen constructed of stone and in some instances carrying a large pipe organ. This screen traditionally separated the quire from the nave and the clergy from the laity, who were expected to worship at parish churches, rather than at the cathedral. The nave of the cathedral, in medieval times, was used primarily for processions. At its western end it contains the font for the ritual washing service of Baptism, at which a person, most often an infant, is symbolically accepted into the church. The font is usually made of stone and is usually the oldest fitting in the cathedral, many of them being Norman.|$|E
5|$|The thicker {{end of the}} log, the {{end that}} was nearest to the tree's roots, may have a special significance. In Montenegro <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> head of the badnjak; the main log is laid on the fire with its head {{pointing}} east. In central Serbia the badnjak is laid with its thicker end sticking out from the ognjište. The household's shepherds would kiss over it to ensure an abundance of lambs in the coming year. In Gruža it is coated with honey which is then licked by children. At the side of ognjište where the thicker end is situated, the family may place a plowshare, a round loaf of bread, a glove filled with wheat, sugar, or a sieve containing grain, honey, cakes, wine, salt, prunes, walnuts, and apples. The cut surface of the thicker end is in Čečava kissed by all the family members after the badnjak is laid on the fire.|$|E
