5|$|Because of {{the opening}} of Phase 1, {{ridership}} on the Lexington Avenue Line at the 68th Street, 77th Street, 86th Street, and 96th Street stations decreased in January 2017 compared to in January 2016. The Second Avenue Line's three stations and the renovated Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station saw an average weekday ridership of more than 150,000 {{by the end of}} January. The 72nd Street station was the busiest of the line's new stations, with an average daily ridership of 44,000. By April, taxi usage in the area also saw a decline of more than 20% compared to before the line's opening. By May 15, Second Avenue ridership had increased to 176,000 passengers a day, reducing overall usage on the Lexington Avenue Line by 26% while representing a 42% increase from the Second Avenue ridership in January. Because of the increasing demand, Q service will be increased by one downtown trip in the morning and by one uptown trip in the evening on November 6, 2017. In addition, one northbound R trip was rerouted from the IND Queens Boulevard Line to further boost service. This trip will return southbound in the evening <b>in</b> <b>Q</b> service.|$|E

25|$|Crossan {{relies heavily}} {{on the work of}} John Kloppenborg, who does not {{outwardly}} support Crossan’s theory. “A documentary hypothesis for the relationship between Q and Thomas must be ruled out.” Kloppenborg points out that there are instances of overlap that scholars believe are Common Sayings Source material found in the wisdom speeches, “Thomas lacks elements present <b>in</b> <b>Q,</b> which had Thomas known Q, would surely have taken over.” Kloppenborg created the stratification theory <b>in</b> <b>Q</b> that Crossan relies on but it seems that Kloppenborg does not agree with the use of his theory to create a comparison between his layering of Q and the layering of the Gospel of Thomas.|$|E

25|$|Jesus was {{apparently}} {{a follower of}} John, a populist and activist prophet who looked forward to divine deliverance of the Jewish homeland from the Romans.

25|$|Principal {{component}} analysis {{is used to}} study large data sets, such as those encountered in bioinformatics, data mining, chemical research, psychology, and in marketing. PCA is popular especially in psychology, {{in the field of}} psychometrics. <b>In</b> <b>Q</b> methodology, the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix determine the Q-methodologist's judgment of practical significance (which differs from the statistical significance of hypothesis testing; cf. criteria for determining the number of factors). More generally, principal {{component analysis}} {{can be used as a}} method of factor analysis in structural equation modeling.|$|E
25|$|It is {{reasonable}} to consider functions between partially ordered sets having certain additional properties {{that are related to}} the ordering relations of the two sets. The most fundamental condition that occurs in this context is monotonicity. A function f from a poset P to a poset Q is monotone, or order-preserving, if a ≤ b in P implies f(a) ≤ f(b) <b>in</b> <b>Q</b> (Noting that, strictly, the two relations here are different since they apply to different sets.). The converse of this implication leads to functions that are order-reflecting, i.e. functions f as above for which f(a) ≤ f(b) implies a ≤ b. On the other hand, a function may also be order-reversing or antitone, if a ≤ b implies f(b) ≤ f(a).|$|E
25|$|Pulse {{pressure}} (PP) methods {{measure the}} pressure in an artery over time to derive a waveform and use this information to calculate cardiac performance. However, any measure from the artery includes changes in pressure associated with changes in arterial function, for example compliance and impedance. Physiological or therapeutic changes in vessel diameter are assumed to reflect changes <b>in</b> <b>Q.</b> PP methods measure the combined performance {{of the heart and}} the blood vessels, thus limiting their application for measurement of Q. This can be partially compensated for by intermittent calibration of the waveform to another Q measurement method then monitoring the PP waveform. Ideally, the PP waveform should be calibrated on a beat-to-beat basis. There are invasive and non-invasive methods of measuring PP.|$|E

25|$|About {{ten years}} after Dee's death, the {{antiquarian}} Robert Cotton purchased land around Dee's house and began digging in search of papers and artifacts. He discovered several manuscripts, mainly records of Dee's angelic communications. Cotton's son gave these manuscripts to the scholar Méric Casaubon, who published them in 1659, together with a long introduction critical of their author, as A True & Faithful Relation of What passed for many Yeers between Dr. John Dee (A Mathematician of Great Fame <b>in</b> <b>Q.</b> Eliz. and King James their Reignes) and some spirits. As the first public revelation of Dee's spiritual conferences, the book was extremely popular and sold quickly. Casaubon, who believed in the reality of spirits, argued in his introduction that Dee was acting as the unwitting tool of evil spirits when he believed he was communicating with angels. This book is {{largely responsible for the}} image, prevalent for the following two and a half centuries, of Dee as a dupe and deluded fanatic. Around the same time the True and Faithful Relation was published, members of the Rosicrucian movement claimed Dee as one of their number. There is doubt, however, that an organized Rosicrucian movement existed during Dee's lifetime, and no evidence that he ever belonged to any secret fraternity. Dee's reputation as a magician and the vivid story of his association with Edward Kelley have made him a seemingly irresistible figure to fabulists, writers of horror stories and latter-day magicians. The accretion of false and often fanciful information about Dee often obscures the facts of his life, remarkable as they are in themselves. It also does nothing to promote his Christian leanings: Dee looked to the angels to speak to him about how he might heal the very deep and serious rifts between the Roman Catholic Church, the Reformed Church of England and the Protestant movement in England. Queen Elizabeth I used him as her court astronomer {{on a number of occasions}} not solely because he practised Hermetic arts, but because he was a deeply religious and learned man whom she trusted.|$|E
