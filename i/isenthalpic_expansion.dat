The present investigation continues a study to develop an equation for predicting two phase flow of cryogens through these devices. The test apparatus design allowed <b>isenthalpic</b> <b>expansion</b> of the cryogen through the visco jets. The data covered a range of inlet and outlet operating conditions. The mass flow rate range single phase or two phase was 0. 015 to 0. 98 lbm/hr. The manufacturer's equation was found to overpredict the single phase hydrogen data by 10 percent and the two phase data by as much as 27 percent. Two modifications of the equation resulted in a data correlation that predicts both the single and two phase flow across the visco jet. The first modification was of a theoretical nature, and the second strictly empirical. The former reduced the spread in the two phase data. It was a multiplication factor of 1 - X applied to the manufacturer's equation. The parameter X is the flow quality downstream of the visco jet based on <b>isenthalpic</b> <b>expansion</b> across the device. The latter modification was a 10 percent correction term that correlated 90 percent of the single and two phase data to within +/- 10 percent scatter band...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe Joule-Thomson {{inversion}} curve (JTIC) separates {{regions in}} which {{heating and cooling}} occur upon an <b>isenthalpic</b> <b>expansion.</b> Mixture JTIC calculation is a clear matter for single-phase conditions; if the mixture splits in two or more equilibrium phases, derivatives properties are not defined. However, in practice a system may change its state during an <b>isenthalpic</b> <b>expansion</b> (i. e., a phase boundary is crossed between initial and final conditions); such situations are not uncommon in petroleum engineering applications. Recently, several JTIC construction procedures were proposed for two-phase vapor-liquid systems (D. V. Nichita, C. F. Leibovici, Calculation of Joule-Thomson Inversion Curves for Two-Phase Mixtures, Fluid Phase Equilibria 2006, 246, 167 - 176). For multiphase systems, an apparent JT coefficient can be defined, which incorporates both JT effects and phase distribution changes effects. In this work we present a method for JTIC calculation in multiphase systems, based on isenthalpic flash calculations, with emphasis on mixtures with solid-phase precipitation. Effects {{of the presence of}} a solid phase on the JTIC can be very important, since wax precipitation may occur in natural hydrocarbon systems (crude oils and gas condensates) at temperatures as high as 350 K. For multiphase systems, the locus separating heating/cooling regions in the temperature-pressure plane may have several distinct branches, corresponding to extrema of isenthalpic curves and to angular points of enthalpy variations (given by discontinuities in the JT apparent coefficient at phase boundaries). The proposed method is applied to JTIC calculations for several ternary mixtures and a synthetic hyperbaric fluid...|$|E

40|$|With {{support from}} the Department of Atomic Energy, our {{institute}} has initiated a programme on development and study of a low capacity (20 liters/hr.) turboexpander based Nitrogen liquefier. Hence a process design was carried out and a turboexpander was {{designed to meet the}} requirement of the liquefier. The turboexpander is used for lowering the temperature of the process gas (Nitrogen) by the <b>isenthalpic</b> <b>expansion.</b> The efficiency of the turboexpander mainly depends on the specific speed and specific diameter of the turbine wheel. The paper explains a general methodology for the design of any type of turbine wheel (radial, backward swept and forward swept) for any pressure ratio with different process gases. The design of turbine wheel includes the determination of dimensions, blade profile and velocity triangles at inlet and outlet of the turbine wheel. Generally radial turbine wheels are used but in this case to achieve the high efficiency at desired speed, backward curved blades are used to maintain the Mach number of the process gas at the nozzle exit, close to unity. If the velocity of fluid exceeds the speed of sound, the flow gets choked leading to the creation of shock waves and flow at the exit of the nozzle will be non-isentropic...|$|E

The test rig used to acquire the data was designed to minimize heat transfer so that fluid expansion through the Visco Jets would be isenthalpic. The data include a range of fluid inlet pressures from 30 to 60 psia, fluid inlet temperatures from 118 to 164 R, outlet pressures from 2. 8 to 55. 8 psia, outlet temperatures from 117 to 162 R and flow rate from 0. 04 to 4. 0 lbm/hr of nitrogen. A flow rate equation supplied by the manufacturer was found to accurately predict single-phase (noncavitating) liquid nitrogen flow through the Visco Jets.

40|$|The leakage process {{simulation}} of a Natural Gas Liquid (NGL) storage tank requires the simultaneous {{solution of the}} NGL’s pressure, temperature and phase state in the tank and across the leak hole. The methods available in the literature rarely consider the liquid/vapor phase transition of the NGL during such a process. This paper provides a comprehensive pressure-temperature-phase state method to solve this problem. With this method, the phase state of the NGL is predicted by a thermodynamic model based on the volume translated Peng-Robinson equation of state (VTPR EOS). The tank’s pressure and temperature are simulated according to the pressure-volume-temperature and <b>isenthalpic</b> <b>expansion</b> principles of the NGL. The pressure, temperature, leakage mass flow rate across the leak hole are calculated from an improved Homogeneous Non-Equilibrium Diener-Schmidt (HNE-DS) model and the isentropic expansion principle. In particular, the improved HNE-DS model removes the ideal gas assumption used in the original HNE-DS model by using a new compressibility factor developed from the VTPR EOS to replace the original one derived from the Clausius-Clayperon equation. Finally, a robust procedure of simultaneously solving the tank model and the leak hole model is proposed and the method is validated by experimental data. A variety of leakage cases demonstrates that this method is effective in simulating the dynamic leakage process of NGL tanks under critical and subcritical releasing conditions associated with vapor/liquid phase change...|$|E

With reaction enthalpies {{as high as}} - 1 793 kJ/mol naphthalene reacted, there are many opportunities for energy recovery making these systems attractive for process integration research. The prodn. of PA from naphthalene is used to investigate two energy recovery schemes. The first is a Rankine cycle that uses steam, raised during the cooling of the reactor, to produce power. The second also includes a turbine expander at the reactor exit. It expands hot reactor product gases to deliver addnl. power and reduces {{the pressure of the}} reactor product before it enters the sepn. section. Simulation results showed that, under certain operating conditions, the steam cycle alone could not supply the feed compression power requirement. However, when a turbine expander is included in the process, all of the power requirements can be fulfilled and as much as 2 651 Mj/ton PA can be exported for use elsewhere. Unlike power generation from fossil fuels, no carbon dioxide is emitted to the atm. when an expansion turbine is used. Savings in CO 2 emissions between 0. 46 - 0. 75 ton CO 2 /ton PA are estd. for this unit.

For delta P's of 3 to 30 psid, the spray sauter mean diameter (SMD) ranged between 250 to 50 microns. The pressure range tested is representative of those expected during cryogenic fluid transfer operations in space. The droplet sizes from the flat spray nozzles were greater than those from the full cone nozzle. A power function of the form, SMD varies as delta P(exp a), describes the spray SMD {{as a function of the}} delta P very well. The values of a were - 0. 36 for the flat spray and - 0. 87 for the full cone. The reduced dependence of the flat spray SMD on the delta P was probably because of: (1) the absence of a swirler that generates a turbulence within the nozzle to enhance atomization, and (2) a possible increase in shearing stress resulting from the delayed atomization due to the absence of turbulence. The nitrogen quality, up to 1. 5 percent is based on <b>isenthalpic</b> <b>expansion,</b> did not have a distinct and measurable effect on the spray SMD.

40|$|Pakistan is a gas rich but power poor country. It consumes {{approximately}} 1, 559 Billion {{cubic feet}} of natural gas annually. Gas is transported {{around the country in}} a system of pressurized transmission pipelines under a pressure range of 600 - 1000 psig exclusively operated by two state owned companies i. e. SNGPL (Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited) and SSGCL (Sui Southern Gas Company Limited). The gas is distributed by reducing from the transmission pressure into distribution pressure up to maximum level of 150 psig at the city gate stations normally called SMS (Sales Metering Station). As a normal practice gas pressure reduction at those SMSs is accomplished in pressure regulators (PCVs or in throttle valves) where <b>isenthalpic</b> <b>expansion</b> takes place without producing any energy. Pressure potential of natural gas is an untapped energy resource which is currently wasted by its throttling. This pressure reduction at SMS (pressure drop through SMS) may also be achieved by expansion of natural gas in TE, which converts its pressure into the mechanical energy, which can be transmitted any loading device for example electric generator. The aim of present paper is to explore the expected power production potential of various Sales Metering Stations of SSGCL company in Pakistan. The model of sales metering station was developed in a standard flow sheeting software Aspen HYSYS® 7. 1 to calculate power and study other parameters when an expansion turbine is used instead of throttling valves.

40|$|The {{vortex tube}} is an {{intriguing}} device that separates an incoming high-pressure fluid stream into a two low-pressure streams. Work interaction during the expansion process causes a temperature decrease {{in of the}} two exit streams, while the other one experiences a temperature increase. The expansion process in a vortex tube therefore approaches isentropic rather than <b>isenthalpic</b> <b>expansion,</b> and the internal flow separation is achieved without any moving parts, resulting in robust and inexpensive designs. Commercially available vortex tubes are almost exclusively used for spot cooling in industrial applications and use compressed air as the working fluid. In addition, vortex tubes have been gaining lots of attention in air-conditioning and refrigeration research, because of the possibility to replace the expansion valve of vapor compression systems with this low-cost device that can recover expansion work {{that would otherwise be}} lost in the isenthalpic throttling process. Most of the work on vortex tubes used for refrigeration have been numerical studies, and many of them predict very optimistic energy efficiency improvements. However, the few papers available that describe experimental validation of vortex tubes in HVAC 2 ̆ 6 R systems are far less optimistic, which is often caused by the selection of cycle architectures that seem inappropriate for vortex tubes. This paper takes a fresh look at vortex tubes used as the expansion device in refrigeration systems. Vortex tube performance is assessed on a fundamental level for different working fluids, including air and R 134 a. Suitable vortex tube geometries and operating conditions have been identified and actual work recovery effects have been demonstrated experimentally for both air and R 134 a. Based on these new findings it is possible to devise novel vortex tube cycles that are able to utilize the demonstrated improvement potentials when applied to vapor compression systems...|$|E
40|$|Future superconducting radio {{frequency}} (SRF) cavities, {{as part of}} Project X at Fermilab, will be cooled to superfluid helium temperatures by a cryogenic distribution system supplying cold supercritical helium. To reduce vapor fraction during the final Joule-Thomson (J-T) expansion into the superfluid helium cooling bath, counter-flow, plate-fin heat exchangers will be utilized. Due to their compact size and ease of fabrication, plate-fin heat exchangers are an effective option. However, the design of compact and high-effectiveness cryogenic heat exchangers operating at liquid helium temperatures requires consideration of axial heat conduction along the direction of flow, in addition to variable fluid properties. Here we present a numerical model that includes the effects of axial conduction and variable properties for a plate fin heat exchanger. The model is used to guide design decisions on heat exchanger material choice and geometry. In addition, the J-T expansion process is modeled with the heat exchanger to analyze the effect of heat load and cryogenic supply parameters. A numerical model that includes the effects of axial conduction and variable properties for a plate fin heat exchanger was developed {{and the effect of}} various design parameters on overall heat exchanger size was investigated. It was found that highly conductive metals should be avoided in the design of compact JT heat exchangers. For the geometry considered, the optimal conductivity is around 3. 5 W/m-K and can range from 0. 3 - 10 W/m-K without a large loss in performance. The model was implemented with an <b>isenthalpic</b> <b>expansion</b> process. Increasing the cold side inlet temperature from 2 K to 2. 2 K decreased the liquid fraction from 0. 856 to 0. 839 which corresponds to a 0. 12 g/s increase in supercritical helium supply needed to maintain liquid level in the cooling bath. Lastly, {{it was found that the}} effectiveness increased when the heat load was below the design value. Therefore, the heat exchanger should be sized on the high end of the required heat load...|$|E
40|$|The main {{components}} of a helium liquefier determines the performance for a given compressor flow rate are Turbine, HE and JT valve. Turbine and JT valve produces cooling effect by isentropic and <b>isenthalpic</b> <b>expansion.</b> For each configuration {{main components}} can have different operating process parameters leading to different performance of HRL. This project involves the analysis and optimization of compressor outlet pressure for a given configuration. JT valve is at the lowest temperature to get the highest liquefaction which depends {{on the performance of}} other components so optimization of process parameter of JT valve is not considered here. One of the different cycle configurations is analyzed and is often used in HRL. This configuration, planned to use for the indigenous helium plant, has 3 turbines and 8 HE which produces liquid helium at 4. 5 K. 1 st and 2 nd turbines operates at warmer temperature compared to 3 rd and those are connected in series. Helium stream coming out of the 1 st turbine passes to HE which will reduce its temperature before entering the 2 nd turbine. Helium flow rate supplied by the compressor system is 210 g/s at 14 bar and 310 k. Effects of compressor flow rate and pressure on the cooling capacity of the plant have been analyzed. A part of this flow rate passes through a 1 st and 2 nd turbine for isentropic expansion to 1. 2 bar and then this low pressure helium stream comes back to compressor suction through different HE to transfer cooling effect to the hot stream coming from the compressor. 3 rd turbine will expand to 4 bar and this stream further passes through a HE before entering the JT valve for liquid helium production. This work involves different practical factors and in efficiencies of main components. The analysis result for flow of 140 g/s at 14 bars is further compared with the performance of existing helium plant at IPR which has same compressor flow parameter.

40|$|Many {{reactions}} {{carried out}} in the chemical industry are exothermic. The heat liberated by the reaction is often transferred to another medium such as steam by heat exchange. This heat can then be used elsewhere or be used to generate power via a steam cycle. In this work the focus is on another method of reaction heat recovery. When an exothermic reaction is conducted at elevated pressures, a turbine expander can be placed directly behind the reactor. The hot, high-pressure product gas from the reactor can then be expanded in the turbine. During the expansion process the physical energy of the product gas is converted to kinetic energy (or electricity if the turbine is connected to a generator). Three chemical processes were studied to determine the feasibility of turbine integration into the processes. They are ethylene oxide production, phthalic anhydride production and the hydrodealkylation of alkylaromatic compounds. The chosen processes differ in terms of reactor operation, reactant conversion as well as {{the presence or absence of}} recycle loops. Simulation models were developed for the mentioned processes with the process simulator Aspen Plus®. Results from the simulations show that, without the turbine, the processes require power from external sources. They can however operate independently from external power sources when a turbine is present. Excess power can be exported or used for electricity generation. It is therefore feasible• to incorporate turbine expansion units in all the processes considered. The operating conditions of some unit operations have to be changed to accommodate the turbine expander. With the additional product namely power, a re-evaluation of all the operating conditions and tradeoffs in the process is necessary. Further investigation into the impact of turbine integration on the optimal operating conditions of the process is therefore recommended. Traditional definitions used to evaluate the performance of a process generating or consuming power, were found to be inadequate for use in processes where power and chemicals are produced together. New performance parameters are required for the evaluation of processes where power and chemicals are produced simultaneously. An exergy analysis was performed for one of the cases. This analysis method provides insight as to where thermodynamic losses occur in a process. The exergy analysis was useful to quantify the losses occurring in an <b>isenthalpic</b> <b>expansion</b> valve, and the savings obtained by replacing such a valve with an expansion turbine.

40|$|Cavitation {{is defined}} as the process of {{formation}} and disappearance of a vapor phase in a liquid when this liquid is subjected to reduced pressures, followed by an increase of pressure. One of the main challenges in the design and application of centrifugal pumps is the ability to control and limit the development of cavitation. It is generally unlikely that a pump will operate across its entire operating range without any cavitation. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is used extensively to model cavitation in pump impellers. These models are almost always governed by empirical relations, which is no problem for cold water that has ample test data to be validated with, but makes the prediction of cavitation for hydrocarbons or amine solutions impossible. In the present work the cavitation development of water, butane and propane is described using a barotropic model assuming an <b>isenthalpic</b> <b>expansion</b> in the two-phase region. This barotropic relation should only be governed by the fluid properties, no empiricism should be involved. In order to validate the model, it is implemented in both 1 -dimensional and 2 -dimensional situations. In the 1 -dimensional situation the Euler equations are solved for a single dimension in combination with source terms that model the varying area distribution of a Venturi-like nozzle. By forcing all three liquids through the nozzle at different velocities and pressures, insight is gained into the general qualitative performance of the model, both physical and numerical. In order to validate the model quantitatively with test data, the model is implemented into a 2 -dimensional situation. A circular rod with a hemispherical head is pointed into the flow to obtain the pressure distribution over the head and part of the rod. This pressure distribution is then compared with data from experiments performed by Rouse & McNown, in order to perform a simple quantitative validation of the model. Based on the work done in this thesis it is concluded that an isenthalpic barotropic model is a suitable approach to describe cavitation. Due to the independence from empirical relations, the development of cavitation for three different fluids can be modeled, based solely on fluid properties taken from a thermodynamic library. The general results from the 2 D implementation are encouraging, but require more work to remedy the numerical instabilities and extremely slow convergence of the solution. The general recommendation for future work is to further develop and improve the numerics to make the solver more efficient and stable, thus viable for bigger simulations.
