5000|$|These small- to {{medium-sized}} catfishes have opaque, transparent or translucent bodies, hence {{their common}} name Asian <b>glass</b> <b>catfishes.</b> Despite this name, only three described species have clearly transparent bodies: K. minor, K. piperatus and K. vitreolus. Most significant among {{these is the}} ghost catfish (K. vitreolus), which is the [...] "glass catfish" [...] most often seen in the aquarium fish trade. This species was initially confused with the larger glass catfish (K. bicirrhis; infrequent in aquarium trade) and subsequently with K. minor (essentially absent from aquarium trade). This matter was only fully resolved in 2013.|$|E
50|$|Kryptopterus bicirrhis, {{often called}} the <b>glass</b> <b>catfish,</b> is an Asian <b>glass</b> <b>catfish</b> species of the genus Kryptopterus. Until 1989, the concept of K. bicirrhis {{included}} its smaller relative Kryptopterus vitreolus ("ghost catfish"; often confused with K. minor). Its scientific name K. bicirrhis and common name <b>glass</b> <b>catfish</b> are often still used in the aquarium fish trade {{to refer to the}} actual K. vitreolus; as it seems, the larger and more aggressive true K. bicirrhis was only ever exported in insignificant numbers.|$|R

5000|$|Kryptopterus vitreolus, {{known in}} the {{aquarium}} trade traditionally as the <b>glass</b> <b>catfish</b> and also as the ghost catfish or phantom catfish, is a small species of Asian <b>glass</b> <b>catfish.</b> It is commonly seen in the freshwater aquarium trade, but its taxonomy is confusing and was only fully resolved in 2013. It is endemic to Thailand, where found in rivers south of the Isthmus of Kra that drain into the Gulf of Thailand and river basins in the Cardamom Mountains. [...] There are also unconfirmed reports from Penang in Malaysia.|$|R
5000|$|Kryptopterus piperatus is {{a species}} of Asian <b>glass</b> <b>catfish</b> from rivers in {{northern}} Sumatra, Indonesia. [...] It was first described in 2004. True K. piperatus is rarely (if ever) seen in the aquarium trade, while K. vitreolus is common.|$|R
50|$|Kryptopterus minor {{is a small}} {{species of}} Asian <b>glass</b> <b>catfish</b> from the Kapuas River basin in Borneo, Indonesia.

50|$|Native to {{rivers in}} Thailand, <b>glass</b> <b>catfish</b> prefer tanks with open {{swimming}} areas with a moderate current and planted areas that provide shelter. Due to their timid and non-aggressive nature, they {{should always be}} kept {{in a group of}} at least five; they can be kept with other fish species of similar size and temperament.|$|R
50|$|Pareutropius debauwi is {{a species}} of fish in the Schilbeidae, the schilbid catfishes. Its common name is African <b>glass</b> <b>catfish.</b> It is native to Africa, {{where it can be}} found in the Central African Republic, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Gabon. It is {{widespread}} and faces no serious threats.|$|R
5000|$|The African butter catfish (Schilbe mystus) is {{a species}} of fish in the Schilbeidae family. It is native to many major river systems in Africa. [...] Other common names for the fish include butter fish, butter barbel, African <b>glass</b> <b>catfish,</b> lubangu, mystus catfish, silver barbel, and silver catfish. [...] It was {{originally}} described as Silurus mystus by Carl Linnaeus in 1758.|$|R
50|$|<b>Glass</b> <b>catfish</b> {{are highly}} {{sensitive}} {{to changes in}} water quality and pH. The pH should be slightly acidic (around 6.5), water hardness should be low (less than 20, ideally less than 10 °dGH) and the water temperature should be around 25 C. They {{have a reputation for}} being finicky eaters; they prefer live food such as mosquito (Culicidae) larvae, bloodworms (Chironomidae larvae) and brine shrimp (Artemia), but can be weaned to flake food with time.|$|R
40|$|The {{blood and}} lymphatic vasculatures are {{structurally}} and functionally coupled in controlling tissue perfusion, extracellular interstitial fluids, and immune surveillance. Little is known, however, about the molecular mechanisms {{that underlie the}} regulation of bloodlymphatic vessel connections and lymphatic perfusion. Here we show in the adult zebrafish and <b>glass</b> <b>catfish</b> (Kryptopterus bicirrhis) that blood-lymphatic conduits directly connect arterial vessels to the lymphatic system. Under hypoxic conditions, arterial-lymphatic conduits (ALCs) became highly dilated and linearized by NO-induced vascular relaxation, which led to blood perfusion into the lymphatic system. NO blockage almost completely abrogated hypoxia-induced ALC relaxation and lymphatic perfusion. These findings uncover mechanisms underlying hypoxia-induced oxygen compensation by perfusion of existing lymphatics in fish. Our results might also imply that the hypoxia-induced NO pathway contributes to development of progression of pathologies, including promotion of lymphatic metastasis by modulating arterial-lymphatic conduits, in the mammalian system...|$|R
40|$|The first noninvasive {{measurements}} of muscle sarcomere length {{were made by}} laser diffraction during swimming in the <b>glass</b> <b>catfish</b> Kryptopterus bicirri). Sarcomere length changes were recorded at a relatively constant swimming speed (approximately 3. 2 body lengths s tailbeat frequency 5 - 7 beats s" 1) just dorsal to the vertebral column. 18 s of continuous diffraction data were obtained and yielded cyclic sarcomere length changes of only 65 ± 10 nm. Based on published fish morphology, architecture and behaviour, we suggest that these values represent white muscle cyclic sarcomere shortening and elongation during swimming powered by red muscle. The interaction between actin and myosin represents the fundamental force-producing mechanism in all skeletal muscles. Interaction between analogous proteins also occurs within cells, resulting in movement of subcellular organelles. Although considerable detail {{is known about the}} muscle sarcomere length-tension relationship and how isometric force potential is a function of myofilament overlap (Gordon et al. 1966), there are no direct {{measurements of}} myofilamen...|$|R
50|$|Kryptopterus {{species are}} {{different}} from most other catfish because they are free-swimming {{and live in the}} mid to upper region of the water. <b>Glass</b> <b>catfish</b> commonly favor dark places to being out in the open light. A small school of them may hide under elevated rocks, logs, or the shadow of plants. Sometimes, however, one or two may venture out into the open and swim in the upper level of the water. They can be enticed to do this more often if the flow of water in the tank is arranged so that their favorite hiding spots are sheltered, while a gentle current flows in the open areas. Thus, they will move in the open especially at feeding time, as they like to go after food drifting in the current. A generous growth of aquatic plants is necessary for their well-being, and floating plants can filter bright light, which they seem to find unpleasant.|$|R
40|$|Teleost fishes and {{mammalian}} lineages diverged 400 {{million years}} ago, and environmental requirements (water versus air) {{have resulted in}} marked differences in cardiovascular function between fish and mammals. Suggestions that the fish secondary vascular system (SVS) {{could be used as}} a model for the mammalian lymphatic system should be taken with caution. Despite molecular markers indicating similar genetic origin, functions of the SVS in teleost fish are probably different from those of the mammalian lymphatic system. We determined that, in resting <b>glass</b> <b>catfish</b> (Kryptopterus bicirrhis), plasma moves from the primary vascular system (PVS) to the SVS through small connecting vessels less than 10 m in diameter, smaller than the red blood cells (RBCs). During and following hypoxia or exercise, flow increases and RBCs enter the SVS, possibly via beta-adrenoreceptor-mediated dilation of the connecting vessels. The volume of the SVS can be large and, as RBCs flow into the SVS, the haematocrit of the PVS falls by as much as 50 % of the resting value. Possible functions of the SVS, including skin respiration, ionic and osmotic buffering, and reductions in heart work and RBC turnover, are discussed...|$|R
