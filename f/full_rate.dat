About 100,000 people were affected by this change, half of whom were receiving Supplementary Benefit under the social security scheme.

25|$|Under {{previous}} Umayyad rulers, Arab Muslims {{had certain}} financial privileges over non-Arab Muslims. Non-Arab converts to Islam were still {{expected to pay}} the jizya poll tax that they paid before becoming Muslims. Umar put into practice a new system that exempted all Muslims, regardless of their heritage, from the jizya tax. He also added some safeguards to the system {{to make sure that}} mass conversion to Islam would not cause the collapse of the finances of the Umayyad government. Under the new tax policy, converted mawali would not pay the jizya, but upon conversion, their land would become the property of the villages and remain liable to the <b>full</b> <b>rate</b> of the kharaj, or land tax. This compensated for the loss of income due to the diminished jizya tax base.|$|E

500|$|When A-10 <b>full</b> <b>rate</b> {{production}} was first authorized the planned service life was 6,000 hours. A small reinforcement {{to the design}} was quickly adopted when the A-10 failed initial fatigue testing at 80% of testing; with the fix, the A-10 passed the fatigue tests. 8,000 flight hour service lives were becoming common at the time, so fatigue testing of the A-10 continued with a new 8,000 hour target. Fatigue testing for the new target quickly discovered serious cracks at Wing Station 23 (WS23) where the outboard portions of the wings are joined to the fuselage. The first production change was to add cold working at WS23 to address this problem. [...] Soon after that, the Air Force determined that the real world A-10 fleet fatigue was more harsh than estimated forcing them to change their fatigue testing, introducing [...] "spectrum 3" [...] equivalent flight hour testing.|$|E

40|$|Nine {{trials were}} {{conducted}} {{over three years}} at three sites to evaluate the efficacy of reduced rates of various fungicide products for their biological efficacy in controlling stem, foliar and ear diseases of winter wheat {{as well as their}} effects on yield and grain quality, and to compare the relative profitability of <b>full</b> and reduced <b>rates</b> of fungicides. The results show that the use of half rates can give an economic benefit over that of <b>full</b> <b>rates</b> in many situations. In circumstances where variety or seasonal factors resulted in low to moderate foliar disease pressure the use of half rates gave similar yields to that of <b>full</b> <b>rates.</b> Where foliar disease pressure was high, half rates generally gave lower yields than <b>full</b> <b>rates</b> but the amount of the reduction varied with the fungicide product used. The use of spray additives improved the yield response of the half rate treatments in most cases. Disease levels (septoria) were higher in treatments where half rates were used, compared with the corresponding <b>full</b> <b>rates,</b> but the used of spray additives improved the disease control in the half rate treatments. The timing of spray applications is critical when half rates of fungicides are being used. Reduced rate treatments need to be applied more frequently. In these trials reduced rate treatments were applied as a three-spray programme rather than the conventional two-spray programme.

At last he persuaded them that he had better send a note to hasten {{the coming of the}} presents, and he also managed to write a letter for England, on his last half-sheet of paper, by the light of a lamp made of a rag wick floating in native butter in a calabash.

60|$|Beyond the pork-houses, and up farther {{towards the}} canal, {{there were some}} houses under the Basin banks. They were good places for the fever-and-ague which people had in those days without knowing it was malaria, or {{suffering}} it to interfere much with the pleasure and business of life; but they seemed to my boy bowers of delight, especially one {{where there was a}} bear, chained to a weeping-willow, and another where there was a fishpond with gold-fish in it. He expected this bear to get loose and eat him, but that could not spoil his pleasure in seeing the bear stand on his hind-legs and open his red mouth, as I have seen bears do when you wound them up by a keyhole in the side. In fact, a toy bear is very much like a real bear, and safer to have round. The boys were always wanting to go and look at this bear, but he was not so exciting as the daily arrival of the Dayton packet. To my boy's young vision this craft was of such incomparable lightness and grace as no yacht of Mr. Burgess's could rival. When she came in of a summer evening her deck was thronged with people, and the captain stood with his right foot on the spring-catch that held the tow-rope. The water curled away {{on either side of her}} sharp prow, that cut its way onward at the <b>full</b> <b>rate</b> of five miles an hour, and the team came swinging down the tow-path at a gallant trot, the driver sitting the hindmost horse of three, and cracking his long-lashed whip with loud explosions, as he whirled its snaky spirals in the air. All the boys in town were there, meekly proud to be ordered out of his way, to break and fly before his volleyed oaths and far before his horses' feet; and suddenly the captain pressed his foot on the spring and released the tow-rope. The driver kept on to the stable with unslackened speed, and the line followed him, swishing and skating over the water, while the steersman put his helm hard aport, and the packet rounded to, and swam softly and slowly up to her moorings. No steamer arrives from Europe now with such thrilling majesty.|$|E
