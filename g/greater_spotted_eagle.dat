2500|$|Kaziranga hosts a {{large number}} of raptors, {{considered}} a sign of a healthy ecosystem. This includes the rare eastern imperial eagle, <b>greater</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>eagle,</b> white-tailed fishing eagle, Pallas's fish eagle, grey-headed fish eagle and the lesser kestrel. Kaziranga was once home to seven species of vultures. About 99% of the stable vulture population was killed by kidney failure caused by consuming the veterinary drug diclofenac in domestic animal carcasses. Of these, the red-headed vulture, and Eurasian black vulture are still near threatened due to their large range, but the Indian vulture, slender-billed vulture and the Indian white-rumped vulture have suffered cataclysmic loss of numbers and are virtually extinct in the wild, including Kaziranga. The Indian populations of the other two vultures have similar losses [...] the griffon vulture and the Himalayan griffon, but they are still well represented outside India. The loss of this many vultures creates a critical void in the scavengers ecological niche in Kaziranga.|$|E
2500|$|The {{conservation}} area or habitat in the Phobhjikha Valley, established in 2003 has, {{not only the}} black-necked cranes, but also 13 other vulnerable species such as rufous-necked hornbill Aceros nipalensis, chestnut-breasted partridge Arborophila mandellii, Pallas's fish eagle Haliaeetus leucoryphus, nuthatch Sitta Formosa, wood snipe Gallinago nemoricola, Blyth's tragopan Tragopan blythii, <b>greater</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>eagle</b> Clanga clanga, imperial eagle Aquila heliaca, Baer's pochard Aythya baeri, Hodgson's bushchat Saxicola insignis, dark-rumped swift Apus acuticauda, and grey-crowned prinia Prinia cinereocapilla. The black-necked cranes arrive in this valley in late October and depart in mid February. They feed on the particular type of dwarf bamboos that grow in the wetlands of the valley. The thick grasslands of wetlands are also grazing grounds for {{a large number of}} cattle and horses during the summer months that helps the growth of the tender bamboo shoots on which the cranes feed later during the winter season. There were suggestions that the wetlands be drained and used to grow cash crops such as potatoes, which is also the main crop of the valley. Such an action would have deprived the cranes of their main feeding centres. However, Palje [...] "Benjie" [...] Dorji, former Chief Justice of Bhutan, former Minister for Environment and uncle of the present King of Bhutan, as the Chairman of the Royal Bhutan Society and as founder of the Black-necked Conservation Programme prevailed on the Government of Bhutan to drop the proposal to drain the wetlands of the Phobjika Valley to create farms to grow cash rich seed potatoes.|$|E

2500|$|Generally speaking, {{there appears}} to be rather {{strictly}} adhered size hierarchy among birds of prey and the very largest raptorial prey attacked by Eurasian eagle-owl tend to roughly equal to their own size. Larger raptors, such as eagles and vultures, seem to be largely invulnerable to eagle-owls. However, in Scandinavia, there are two cases of eagle-owls preying on “fairly large” nestlings of white-tailed eagles (Haliaeetus albicilla). Given the size, average adult weight of , and formidable character of this eagle, {{it is possible that the}} young of other raptors larger than themselves may too be attacked. Eastern imperial eagles (Aquila heliaca), which are nearly as large as the white-tailed eagle at an average weight of , have been killed by eagle-owls in Kazakhstan. Remarkable, considering the greater threat that the eagle normally poses to the eagle-owl than vica versa, it appeared a golden eagle was amongst the prey remains found around a nest in the French Pyrenees. Cases in Spain where large, formidable birds of prey, the Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) and Bonelli's eagle, that are roughly equal in size to the eagle-owls, both weighing just over , have been predated, these seem to be taken from the nest or shortly after independence and rare occurrences. However, in Turkey, the eagle-owl is apparently a regular and serious predator of Bonelli's eagles. The Eurasian eagle-owl predates the largest members of the most species-rich diurnal raptor genera: the [...] northern goshawks from the Accipiter genus, the [...] upland buzzards from the Buteo genus and the [...] gyrfalcons (F. rusticolus) of the Falco genus. Additional large raptors, i.e. those that can average [...] or more in body mass, taken as prey include [...] osprey (Pandion haliaetus), the [...] red kites (Milvus milvus), [...] short-toed eagles (Circaetus gallicus), the [...] <b>greater</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>eagle</b> (Clanga clanga), the [...] lesser spotted eagle (Clanga pomarina), and the rough-legged buzzards (Buteo lagopus) and saker falcons (Falco cherrug), in both of which females average more than [...] The taking of rough-legged buzzards and snowy owls must be confined to full-grown victims, since they nest further north than Eurasian eagle-owls. Eurasian eagle-owls also hunt the smallest raptors available, including those such as lesser kestrels (Falco naumanni) and Japanese sparrowhawks (Accipiter gularis) that weigh less than [...] Some of these are cases of eagle-owls killing nestlings or fledglings but they can easily overtake adult buzzards, goshawks and falcons of any size.|$|E
