5|$|In 1995, Toriyama {{detailed}} the equipment he used for Dragon Ball. He used a G-pen nib by Zebra, usually getting three chapters {{out of one}} because he typically does not press down hard. Toriyama used black <b>drawing</b> <b>ink</b> made by Pilot, but his color ink was produced by Luma and applied with a ten-year-old fine point Tenshōdō brush. His whiteout was also made by Luma. He received free Kent paper, similar to Bristol board, from a seller connected to Shueisha, and used a 0.5mm 2B lead mechanical pencil and a wide ruler at least 30cm long.|$|E

40|$|THz time-domain {{spectroscopy}} in {{transmission mode}} {{was applied to}} study dry and wet <b>drawing</b> <b>inks.</b> In specific, cochineal-, indigo- and iron-gall based inks have been investigated; some prepared following ancient recipes and others by using synthetic materials. The THz investigations have been realized on both pellet samples, made by dried inks blended with polyethylene powder, and layered inks, made by liquid deposition on polyethylene pellicles. We implemented an improved THz spectroscopic technique that enabled the measurement of the material optical parameters and thicknesses of the layered ink samples on absolute scale. This experimental investigation shows that the THz techniques have the potentiality to recognize <b>drawing</b> <b>inks</b> by their spectroscopic features...|$|R

50|$|Like many Parker {{fountain}} pens, the 180 had {{a flexible}} ink sac reservoir.

50|$|The dip pen {{has certain}} {{advantages}} over a fountain pen. It can use waterproof, pigmented, particle-and-binder-based inks, such as India ink, <b>drawing</b> <b>ink,</b> and acrylic inks—each {{of which would}} destroy a fountain pen by clogging it—and the traditional iron gall ink, which can corrode fountain pens. Dip pens are also more sensitive to variations of pressure and speed, producing a line that naturally varies in thickness; and they can also produce a finer line than any fountain pen.|$|E
50|$|As {{early as}} 1985, Lebrun {{began to use}} the {{computer}} {{as a means to}} streamline and modernize production. Originally, he employed the conventional tools and materials used by earlier Blondie artists: steel pen points (originally Gillot 1290s, later Hunt 103 or 104s for the line work and filed-down Speedball A-2s for lettering), Strathmore two-ply plate finish paper and Pelikan <b>drawing</b> <b>ink.</b> By January 2002, Lebrun made the strip's production fully digital, abandoning paper, pencil and ink in favor of the PowerPC G4.|$|E

50|$|Gallic acid is an {{important}} component of iron gall ink, the standard European writing and <b>drawing</b> <b>ink</b> from the 12th to 19th centuries, with a history extending to the Roman empire and the Dead Sea Scrolls. Pliny the Elder (23-79 AD) describes his experiments with it and writes that it was used to produce dyes. Galls (also known as oak apples) from oak trees were crushed and mixed with water, producing tannic acid. It could then be mixed with green vitriol (ferrous sulfate) — obtained by allowing sulfate-saturated water from a spring or mine drainage to evaporate — and gum arabic from acacia trees; this combination of ingredients produced the ink.|$|E
50|$|The lifework of Szabó can {{be divided}} into periods. Between two {{extremely}} productive periods that, at the same time, marked {{the beginning and end of}} his lifework - the first period established his reputation as a fantastic, dreamlike and surrealist artist, and the last period remained unfinished in a sense -, there are several phases in which Szabó devoted himself to an artistic technique, a topic in a collected and virtuosic way. For example, his disproportionate anatomic studies made with black <b>drawing</b> <b>ink</b> that look like they were woven from a single string, or the series with pastose colour compositions in acrylic, which were classified as sculptures by Szabó rather than paintings.|$|E

5000|$|A dip pen (or nib pen) {{consists}} of a metal nib with capillary channels, {{like that of a}} fountain pen, mounted on a handle or holder, often made of wood. A dip pen usually has no ink reservoir and must be repeatedly recharged with ink while drawing or writing. The dip pen has certain advantages over a fountain pen. It can use waterproof pigmented (particle-and-binder-based) inks, such as so-called India ink, <b>drawing</b> <b>ink,</b> or acrylic inks, which would destroy a fountain pen by clogging, as well as the traditional iron gall ink, which can cause corrosion in a fountain pen. Dip pens are now mainly used in illustration, calligraphy, and comics. A particularly fine-pointed type of dip pen known as a crowquill is a favorite instrument of artists, such as David Stone Martin and Jay Lynch, because its flexible metal point can create a variety of delicate lines, textures and tones with slight pressures while drawing.|$|E

40|$|The low {{accuracy}} {{rates of}} textshape dividers for digital ink diagrams are hindering {{their use in}} real world applications. While recognition of handwriting is well advanced {{and there have been}} many recognition approaches proposed for hand drawn sketches, there has been less attention on the division of text and <b>drawing</b> <b>ink.</b> Feature based recognition is a common approach for textshape division. However, the choice of features and algorithms are {{critical to the success of}} the recognition. We propose the use of data mining techniques to build more accurate textshape dividers. A comparative study is used to systematically identify the algorithms best suited for the specific problem. We have generated dividers using data mining with diagrams from three domains and a comprehensive ink feature library. The extensive evaluation on diagrams from six different domains has shown that our resulting dividers, using LADTree and LogitBoost, are significantly more accurate than three existing dividers. <br /...|$|E

And case three is that both the first touch and the second touch were unintended. In both case two and three, the unintended <b>drawn</b> <b>ink</b> stroke should be removed. Therefore, to minimize the occurrences of IDIR, we embed a function that invokes DIR only for the first touch.|$|R
