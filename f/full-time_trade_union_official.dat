Efforts were made to select Senior Correspondents in order to expand LabourStart's footprint in various countries but these were mostly unsuccessful.

50|$|A <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>official</b> told an {{employer}} his members {{would not work}} alongside the claimants. The employer was pressured {{to get rid of}} the claimants. For the loss of work, the claimants sued the <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>official.</b> An important fact is that all the workers in the case were only hired day by day. Therefore, the <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>official</b> had never threatened a breach of contract because the contracts began afresh with a new day's work.|$|R

While he could be forceful and committed, he was never dogmatic or unnecessarily aggressive." [...] He believed that the Labour Party was central to radical social change.|$|E

5000|$|Harry Cavan {{spent most}} of his life as a <b>full-time</b> <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>official,</b> first for the Association of Supervisory Staffs, Executives and Technicians (ASSET), which merged with the Association of Scientific Workers (AScW) in 1968 forming the Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs (ASTMS). A member of the Northern Ireland Labour Party, he ran as an NILP {{candidate}} for Ards Council around 1956 in opposition to the Ulster Unionist Party. He considered football a great unifier across community divides. Despite this, some accused him of being uncharitable as in 1973 when he attempted to cancel a friendly game between the then World Champions, Brazil, and an all-Ireland select team. The game went ahead, although under the banner of southern club Shamrock Rovers F.C. rather than the original [...] "Ireland XI", resulting in the permanent exclusion of Northern Ireland's captain, Derek Dougan from the team. This accusation ignores the fact of Dougan's age and non-selection for the previous five Northern Ireland games prior to this.|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} {{research focuses on}} <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> organisations, and in particular <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> officialdom in Egypt. The study examines {{the extent to which}} <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>officials</b> at the various levels of the <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> hierarchy are reacting to reforms instigated by structural adjustment policies. The adoption of structural adjustment and economic reform measures as proposed by the World Bank and IMF have resulted in the government's withdrawal of some of the benefits and privileges it accorded to workers. Public sector workers are particularly affected by these changes, thereby posing a challenge to <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> officialdom, since the bulk of <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> membership is within the public sector. <b>Trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>officials</b> are reacting to the reform measures by trying to balance their role as representatives of workers' interests and their role in administering state policy. Whereas in the past these two roles were reconcilable, however, with liberalisation of the economy and the adoption of structural adjustment measures that is no longer tenable. Trade unionism has been weakened by the incorporation of <b>union</b> <b>officials</b> within government corporate structures, making it more difficult for <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> officialdom to challenge the reform measures adopted by the government. Rather, <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>officials</b> are opting for `co-operation' both with the government and with management in enterprises, to the cost of workers. In enterprises, <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>officials</b> emphasise that the interests of work and workers are inseparable. At the level of the confederation and general <b>unions,</b> <b>union</b> <b>officials</b> present themselves as working to keep workers' rights, but also as partners with the government in its drive for growth. By so doing <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>officials</b> are de-politicising <b>trade</b> unionism, and instead focus on economic gains. <b>Union</b> <b>officials</b> are redefining their role away from workers. <b>Trade</b> <b>union</b> action at the various levels is not based on what workers want or demand, but rather on what <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>officials</b> want, in the belief that workers do not truly know their interests. As a result, <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> action has promoted the interests of <b>union</b> <b>officials</b> rather than that of the workers. Trade unionism has become in a sense a shell without a content. However, there is evidence that there are pressures to democratise trade unionism and make it more responsive to worker demands. These pressures are from within the worker base, from <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>officials</b> particularly at the enterprise level who are affilited to political parties, and from external forces like the Islamists. However these forces have their limitations, particularly in the face of institutionalised sectors that are capable of reproducing themselves and promoting their interests...|$|R
