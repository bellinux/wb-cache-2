25|$|The most {{conspicuous}} {{difference in the}} Richelieu and Dunkerque profiles was the mounting of the fire control <b>director</b> <b>system</b> aft, {{on a kind of}} mack, so that the funnel opening came out obliquely aft underneath the control tower. Otherwise, Richelieus fire control system was very similar to Dunkerques. All the fire control systems were airtight and fitted with light steel plating against the machine gun attacks of strafing aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The board {{determined}} the following Probable Cause for the accident:...the {{failure of the}} flightcrew to monitor altitude and to recognize passage of the aircraft through the approach decision height during an unstabilized precision approach conducted in rapidly changing meteorological conditions. The unstabilized nature of the approach was due initially to the aircraft's passing the outer marker above the glide slope at an excessive airspeed and thereafter compounded by the flightcrew's preoccupation with the questionable information presented by the flight <b>director</b> <b>system.</b> The poor positioning of the flight for the approach was in part the result of nonstandard air traffic control services.|$|E
500|$|The primary flight {{controls}} of the Tornado are a fly-by-wire hybrid, consisting of an analogue [...] Command and Stability Augmentation System (CSAS) {{connected to a}} digital Autopilot & Flight <b>Director</b> <b>System</b> (AFDS); in addition a level of mechanical reversion capacity was retained to safeguard against potential failure. To enhance pilot awareness, artificial feel was built into the {{flight controls}}, such as the centrally located stick; because of the Tornado's variable wings enabling the aircraft to drastically alter its flight envelope, the artificial responses adjust automatically to wing profile changes and other changes to flight attitude. As a large variety of munitions and stores can be outfitted, the resulting changes to the aircraft's flight dynamics are routinely compensated for by the flight stability system.|$|E

500|$|After the {{exhibition}} the aircraft {{was moved to}} a Clément-Bayard workshop at Issy-les-Moulineaux for further testing. This work is reflected by additions to the powerplant-related patents of 3 December. A group of modern-day Romanian investigators led by Dan Antoniu, having examined photographs from 1910, concluded that the rotary compressor featured at {{the exhibition}} was a hybrid between the one described in the initial 30 May 1910 patent and that shown in a later patent application. They felt that the exhibition machine had a simpler <b>director</b> <b>system,</b> a different rotor with a smaller intake cone, and that the exhaust gas heat transfer system had not been implemented. According to Gérard Hartmann in his Dossiers historiques et techniques aéronautique française, the propulsion system generated only [...] of thrust, and to generate enough thrust for the aircraft to take off (estimated by Coandă at [...] ) Coandă {{would have had to}} spin the [...] "turbine" [...] (the rotary compressor) at a speed of 7,000rpm with the risk of it exploding. This was not tried, but Hartmann concluded that the experiment proved that the solution worked perfectly.|$|E

SRAAM was slightly longer than Taildog, with a length of [...] The diameter remained the same.

For example Aylesbury was given the STD code 0AY6, where the letter A {{can be found on the}} number 2 and the letter Y on the number 9. The letter O became a zero, such as for Bournemouth: 0BO2 where BO = 20. Originally, where a place's name began with the letter [...] "O" [...] the code would begin with two zeros, such as Oxford: 0OX2 where OX = 09.
