Alongside reassurance, explanation and habit reversal, patients are shown how to breathe using their diaphragms prior to and during the normal rumination period.

40|$|Functionally COPD is {{characterized}} by a reduction in airflow and an increase in dead space. Physical therapy and breathing training is designed to increase tidal volume, decrease respiratory rate and sense of dyspnoea. The respiratory exercises include controlled <b>breathing,</b> <b>diaphragmatic</b> and pursed-lip <b>breathing.</b> Postural drainage has, {{in most parts of the}} world, been replaced by airway clearance regimens that include forced expiratory manoeuvres or technique of breathing at different airflow and lung volume. Percussions and external or internal vibrations are seldom justified in adults. About instrumental chest physiotherapy with positive expiratory pressure support, the literature is confusing except for non invasive ventilation in acute stages. Dyspnoea, impaired exercise tolerance and reduced quality of life are common complaints in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The efficacy of pulmonary rehabilitation has been strongly established by randomized controlled trials as reported by recent meta-analysis. The training intensity is of key importance. High-intensity training is feasible even in patients with more advanced COPD. There is substantial evidence that lower extremity endurance training should be included in the rehabilitation programs. There are beneficial effects of upper extremity endurance and strength training. Ventilatory muscle training may be considered in individual patients. Pulmonary rehabilitation programs must also be comprehensive and flexible to address each patients' need and include smoking cessation, optimal medical treatment, nutritional intervention, psychosocial support and health education. The maintenance of benefits after pulmonary rehabilitation is possible with minimal maintenance of activity. SCOPUS: cp. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|D. Phil. Asthma exemplifies a {{major medical}} concern {{and is a}} {{considerable}} cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} globally and in South Africa. Biokineticists have in the past primarily prescribed aerobic modes of exercise to asthmatics regardless of other modes of exercise {{that could be used in}} the management of asthma, each with their own unique benefits. The aim of this investigation was to develop a management model from a biokinetic perspective for the management of asthma in moderate, persistent asthmatics. The present study utilised a quantitative, comparative, research trial making use of a pre-test, eight-week intervention period and a post-test. Eighty-eight sedentary moderate, persistent asthmatics were matched by age and gender and randomly assigned to either a non-exercising control group (NE) (n = 22), an aerobic exercise group (AE) (n = 22), a <b>diaphragmatic</b> inspiratory resistive <b>breathing</b> group (DR) (n = 22) or an aerobic exercise combined with <b>diaphragmatic</b> resistive <b>breathing</b> group (CE) (n = 22). Dependent t-Tests and rank-ordered analyses revealed that five of the 13 pulmonary function parameters assessed were found to be significantly altered following the AE and CE training, with the CE training having a larger impact than AE training. The DR training resulted in improvements in four of the 13 pulmonary function parameters. The CE and AE training were also found to be equally effective at altering physical work capacity, while the DR training proved ineffective at altering physical work capacity. The CE training proved to be the most effective at improving the abdominal and chest wall excursion parameters. The DR training was found to be the least effective mode of exercise training to impact favourably on abdominal and chest wall excursion parameters. The DR and CE training had a similar significant and favourable change in respiratory muscle flexibility followed by the AE training only impacting on nine of the 11 respiratory muscle flexibility parameters. Regarding the respiratory muscle strength, despite AE and CE training altering 18 of the 20 parameters, CE training was found to be more effective. DR training only altered 16 of the 20 respiratory muscle strength parameters. The DR training was the only modality to alter a postural parameter, albeit unfavourably. Even though the DR and AE training significantly altered four of the six anthropometric parameters, the AE training proved to be superior, while CE training proved least effective as it altered v only three of the measured anthropometric parameters. The overall success of the CE training exemplified the fact that an optimal training regime for the management of asthma may require both an aerobic exercise and <b>diaphragmatic</b> inspiratory resistive <b>breathing</b> component. Exercise training, and specifically CE training is a cost-effective, home-based asthma management programme that may reduce the public health burden of this disease and provide the patient with alternative treatment options. CE training should form the cornerstone in the management of asthma to minimise and prevent asthma exacerbations and thus improve health-related quality of life and may even prove to be life-saving...|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{evaluate}} diaphragmatic motion via M-mode ultrasonography and {{to correlate}} it with pulmonary function in stroke patients. Methods This was a preliminary study comprised of ten stroke patients and sixteen healthy volunteers. The M-mode ultrasonographic probe was positioned in the subcostal anterior {{region of the}} abdomen for transverse scanning of the diaphragm during quiet breathing, voluntary sniffing, and deep <b>breathing.</b> We analyzed <b>diaphragmatic</b> motion {{and the relationship between}} diaphragmatic motion and pulmonary function. Results All stroke patients had restrictive pulmonary dysfunction. Compared to that exhibited by control subjects, stroke patients exhibited a significant unilateral reduction in motion on the hemiplegic side, primarily during volitional <b>breathing.</b> <b>Diaphragmatic</b> excursion in right-hemiplegic patients was reduced on both sides compared to that in control subjects. However, diaphragmatic excursion was reduced only on the left side and increased on the right side in left-hemiplegic patients compared to that in control subjects. Left diaphragmatic motion during deep breathing correlated positively with forced vital capacity (rho= 0. 86, p= 0. 007) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (rho= 0. 79, p= 0. 021).

Regular physical exercise with or without physical therapy can be beneficial to maintain and improve mobility, flexibility, strength, gait speed, and quality of life. When an exercise program is performed under the supervision of a physiotherapist, there are more improvements in motor symptoms, mental and emotional functions, daily living activities, and quality of life compared to a self-supervised exercise program at home. In terms of improving flexibility and range of motion for people experiencing rigidity, generalized relaxation techniques such as gentle rocking have been found to decrease excessive muscle tension. Other effective techniques to promote relaxation include slow rotational movements of the extremities and trunk, rhythmic initiation, <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>breathing,</b> and meditation techniques. As for gait and addressing the challenges associated with the disease such as hypokinesia (slowness of movement), shuffling and decreased arm swing; physiotherapists have a variety of strategies to improve functional mobility and safety.

Strengthening exercises have shown improvements in strength and motor function for people with primary muscular weakness and weakness related to inactivity with mild to moderate Parkinson's disease. However, reports show a significant interaction between strength and the time the medications was taken.

30|$|We {{thought it}} was {{essential}} to have all assessments and measurements taken with noninvasive techniques (e.g., external device for volume, ultrasonography for diaphragm activity, transcutaneous gas values) {{in order to minimize}} a direct effect of these techniques on the observed values (Heisenberg principle) [29, 30]. Importantly, however, these techniques are subject to measurement and performance error and we took great care to standardize the technical conditions for these measurements The lack of effect of diaphragmatic work might probably be explained by the relatively normalized (approximately 30 %) TFdi in these patients at baseline [31, 32] had been stabilized before protocol implementation. Despite having other clinical and biochemical indicators for ventilatory support, our subjects had improved and been stabilized prior to protocol initiation (all subjects weaned to nasal prong oxygen), making it difficult to demonstrate a difference in <b>diaphragmatic</b> work of <b>breathing.</b> This is in contrast to a report of 14 stable chronically hypercapnic COPD patients in which both HFNT and NIV significantly reduced PTPdi (diaphragmatic work) [8]. Furthermore, in a more recent study including 5 hypercapnic patients recovering from acute respiratory failure, esophageal pressure swings, PTP and work of breathing (markers of respiratory effort) were significantly reduced with HFNT at 60  L/min [33]. This difference, however, may also stem from inherent differences in the structure and function of the diaphragm between COPD and CF patients [34].|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the effectiveness of}} respiratory physiotherapy based on clinical evidence and analyze the improvement in respiratory parameters. METHODS: A prospective study {{was carried out in}} the Bone Marrow Transplant Unit of the Universidade Estadual de Campinas (UNICAMP). Two different previously established respiratory physiotherapy protocols were applied from days D- 1 to D+ 7 that aimed to improve airway clearance, pulmonary re-expansion and the strengthening of respiratory muscles. Group A were subjected to <b>diaphragmatic</b> proprioceptive stimulation, <b>breathing</b> exercises, incentive spirometry with Respiron®, inspiratory muscle training with the Threshold® Inspiratory Muscle Training device, bronchial hygienization with Shaker® and cough stimulation. Group B performed a protocol that only used incentive spirometry. The parameters analyzed were: tidal volume, minute volume, maximal inspiratory pressure, maximal expiratory pressure, oxygen saturation, heart rate and respiratory frequency. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients submitted to myeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation were included in this study. Among these, thirty-nine were evaluated and randomized in the two groups. There were significant differences between the groups for tidal volume at D+ 2 (p-value = 0. 007) and maximal inspiratory pressure (p-value = 0. 03), maximal expiratory pressure (p-value = 0. 03) and tidal volume (p-value = 0. 004) at D+ 7.

What is the effect on outcomes related to the target and mechanism of breathing control, as well as physiological and clinical outcomes?DesignSystematic review with meta-analysis. ParticipantsPeople with chronic respiratory disease, post-surgical, or asymptomatic individuals. InterventionBreathing control (relaxed basal, <b>diaphragmatic,</b> or abdominal <b>breathing)</b> as the sole intervention. Outcome measuresAll outcome measures providing continuous data. ResultsTwenty studies were included within the meta-analysis. A beneficial effect was found for abdominal movement (SMD 1. 36, 95 % CI 0. 42 to 2. 31), diaphragm excursion (SMD 1. 39, 95 % CI 1. 00 to 1. 77), respiratory rate (SMD – 0. 84, 95 % CI – 1. 09 to – 0. 60), tidal volume (SMD 0. 98, 95 % CI 0. 71 to 1. 25), arterial oxygen saturation (SMD 0. 63, 95 % CI 0. 25 to 1. 02) and percutaneous oxygen (SMD 1. 48, 95 % CI 0. 85 to 2. 11).
