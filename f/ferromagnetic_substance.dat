30|$|Ferrite {{magnetic}} NPs (Fe 3 O 4 NPs) are {{of particular}} interest in biomedicine from hyperthermia application [2] to targeted therapy and drug delivery [3] because of its superparamagnetic behavior. Unlike strong <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>substances,</b> they show linear dependence of magnetization with external magnetic field {{in the same direction}} with low maximum magnetization, a characteristic property of paramagnetism. But, the magnetic moment is four to ten times more than that of normal paramagnetic substances, hence considered as superparamagnetic [4]. This property allows Fe 3 O 4 NPs to be used as effective vector for targeted drug therapy under the application of external field. However, it has high aggression and oxidation at physiological pH limiting its direct application which, nonetheless, can be overcome by biocompatible surface coating [3, 5]. But, at the same time, coating of Fe 3 O 4 NPs with biocompatible nonmagnetic substance affects magnetization of the particle because of surface spin disorder, formation of dead magnetic zone, etc. which is strongly influenced by thickness and chemical composition of modifier [6]. Hence, tuning of modifier content for maintaining therapeutically significant magnetization value is very important for drug delivery application.|$|R

50|$|Diamagnetic {{materials}} are repelled by a magnetic field; an {{applied magnetic field}} creates an induced magnetic field in them in the opposite direction, causing a repulsive force. In contrast, paramagnetic and ferromagnetic {{materials are}} attracted by a magnetic field. Diamagnetism is a quantum mechanical effect that occurs in all materials; when {{it is the only}} contribution to the magnetism the material is called diamagnetic. In paramagnetic and <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>substances</b> the weak diamagnetic force is overcome by the attractive force of magnetic dipoles in the material. The magnetic permeability of diamagnetic materials is less than μ0, the permeability of vacuum. In most materials diamagnetism is a weak effect which can only be detected by sensitive laboratory instruments, but a superconductor acts as a strong diamagnet because it repels a magnetic field entirely from its interior.Diamagnetism was first discovered when Sebald Justinus Brugmans observed in 1778 that bismuth and antimony were repelled by magnetic fields. In 1845, Michael Faraday demonstrated that it was a property of matter and concluded that every material responded (in either a diamagnetic or paramagnetic way) to an applied magnetic field. On a suggestion by William Whewell, Faraday first referred to the phenomenon as diamagnetic (the prefix dia- meaning through or across), then later changed it to diamagnetism.|$|R

40|$|Magnetic {{techniques}} {{have so far}} been under exploited in the petroleum industry. Recently scientists have published some results on laboratory based magnetic susceptibility data for reservoir rock minerals which show strong correlations with key petrophysical parameters including permeability. However, such laboratory based experiments are not representative of in-situ reservoir conditions. Part of this thesis investigates the in-situ magnetic properties of reservoir rocks and minerals at reservoir temperatures via laboratory experiments to model downhole conditions. The shapes of hysteresis curves at various temperatures and the shapes of temperature dependent susceptibility (TDS) curves for individual minerals (paramagnetic, diamagnetic, ferromagnetic) were used to identify the type of magnetic minerals present, their concentrations, phase transitions and changes in mineralogy. For paramagnetic minerals, magnetic susceptibility decreases {{with an increase in}} temperature, whereas diamagnetic susceptibility is shown to be independent of temperature. <b>Ferromagnetic</b> <b>substances</b> can show a variety of thermomagnetic changes {{depending on the type of}} ferromagnetic minerals present. Changes in the domain state of ferromagnetic carriers with temperature were also observed, which either resulted from the formation of new ferromagnetic components and/or variations in grain size. Theoretical and experimental data on the thermomagnetic properties of reservoir rock minerals are also presented. A downhole sonde capable of taking magnetic susceptibility measurements in-situ downhole has been designed and tested in this thesis. Since the laboratory based methods have demonstrated correlations between the magnetically derived mineral contents and petrophysical parameters, the downhole magnetic susceptibility sonde can potentially provide in-situ predictions of these parameters.

We used commercially available Gd 2 O 3 powder (8.99  g, 99.9  % purity, Rare Metallic Inc., Tokyo) glued with epoxy in a 7 -cc plastic cube. Using this Gd 2 O 3 sample, we made an inter-calibration between our system and a magnetic property measurement system (MPMS) that was independently calibrated using a palladium crystal, a paramagnetic rare-earth metal. We measured a set of natural samples including four different kinds of Quaternary volcanic rocks (OS 2 - 2, MY 07 - 2, DS 04 - 2, SW 03 - 07) and one Paleozoic granite (SH 03 - 07). These samples were selected on the grounds that their hysteresis measurements were well-documented by previous studies (Yamamoto and Hoshi 2008; Yamamoto et al. 2010; Kodama 2013; Kodama 2015). They indicate that three of them (DS 04 - 2, SW 03 - 07, SH 03 - 07) were saturated below 0.7  T (the pulse peak in this study), while the other two (OS 2 - 2, MY 07 - 2) showed no saturation plateau due to the superimposition of paramagnetic components. In terms of the domain structure, the granite SH 03 - 07 is dominated by MD particles and the remaining samples are in the PSD range.

Investigations concerning the formation of magnetite (Fe_ 3 O_ 4) and heavy-metal ferrites (MFe_ 2 O_ 4) were carried out. By the addition of these mostly ferri- or <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>substances,</b> the magnetic properties of mixed precipitation products can be improved such that satisfactory separation efficiencies can be achieved even at moderate flux densities. When selecting the reaction temperature, ion concentrations and oxidation conditions, particular attention was paid to them being practicable in waste water treatment. The reaction variants which were applied included (1) the oxidation of an iron(II) -hydroxide suspension with air ('oxidation method') and (2) the hydroxide precipitation of iron(II) and iron(III) salt solutions ('mixing method'). The solids generated were characterised using various solid-state analytical methods and investigated with regard to their magnetic properties. Depending on the reaction conditions chosen, the precipitates were varying mixtures of the following solids: magnetite, maghemite, geothite, #delta#-FeOOH and amorphous iron(III) -oxide hydrates mostly containing sulphate. With up to about 1 mg L"-" 1 min"-" 1 oxygen being supplied to the reactor ('oxidation method'), magnetite was seen to be formed sufficiently at temperatures equal to and above 15 C. Using the 'mixing method' this was already achieved at a temperature of 5 C. Increasing concentrations of heavy-metal ions (e. g. Cu" 2 "+, Cd" 2 "+, Zn" 2 "+) or certain anions (e. g. of phosphoric or carbonic acid) lead to a reduction in the ferrite proportion of the reaction products.
