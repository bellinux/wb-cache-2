40|$|Sickle cell {{disease is}} define {{as a group}} of genetic {{disorders}} characterized by the presence of hemoglobin <b>S,</b> <b>anemia,</b> and acute and chronic tissue damage. Sickle cell anemia is {{the most common type of}} sickle cell disease, and is caused by the presence of the βs- globin gene in the homozygous state. At present there is no cure for sickle cell anemia except for bone marrow transplantantion, which is available only to a limited number of individuals. The lack of drugs or treatments to cure sickle cell disease is due in part to the absence of good experimental animal models.  The recently available sickle cell transgenic mice models should promote the experimentation of new treatments for sickle cell disease. Until a cure is found, the treatment would continue to alleviate the clinical complications associated with the disease. Un update on immunizations, prophylactic penicillin, folic acid, trental, chelation and iron therapy, experimental and other drugs for treatment of sickle cell anemia is presented in this article...|$|R

The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were 1) to provide more accurate estimates of the relationship between Schistosoma japonicum infection and both protein energy malnutrition (PEM) and anemia through better adjustment for potential confounders such as socioeconomic status (SES) and geo-helminth infections and 2) to assess the role of occult blood loss in mediating <b>S.</b> japonicum–associated <b>anemia.</b> We examined cross-sectionally 729 individuals (86. 7 % S. japonicum–infected and 13. 3 % S. japonicum–uninfected) aged 7 – 30 years in Leyte, The Philippines. The main outcome measures were height-for-age Z-score (HAZ), body-mass-index Z-score (BMIZ), triceps skinfold Z-score, hemoglobin, and fecal occult blood loss. Multivariate models were created to assess the relationship between S. japonicum infection and nutritional status after adjusting for age, gender, other helminths, and SES. After controlling for confounders, intensity of S. japonicum infection was inversely related to hemoglobin in all age groups (P < 0. 0001) and HAZ among children 12 years (P 0. 03), but not to BMIZ (P 0. 52) or triceps skinfold Z-score (P 0. 11). Individuals with high-intensity S. japonicum infection were 3. 5 {{times more likely to have}} occult blood in the stool. Adjustment for occult blood did not attenuate the relationship between S. japonicum and hemoglobin, suggesting other mechanisms are involved.

Com o objetivo de verificar a presença de talassemia alfa em portadores de hemoglobina S em heterozigose, com presença de anemia, encaminhados ao Laboratório de Hemoglobinas do Departamento de Biologia da UNESP, de São José do Rio Preto, analisamos 1. 002 amostras de sangue com traço falciforme, no período de 1990 a 1998.

Para o diagnóstico laboratorial as amostras de sangue foram submetidas a procedimentos eletroforéticos em pH alcalino e ácido e pesquisa citológica de hemoglobina H.

The primary objective {{of this study was}} to assess the role of occult blood loss in mediating <b>S.</b> japonicum-associated <b>anemia</b> after adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status (SES), and other helminth infections. The secondary objective was to identify intensity categories of risk for occult blood loss for Trichuris and hookworm after adjustment for the presence of other helminth infections. The role of occult blood loss in mediating <b>S.</b> japonicum-associated <b>anemia</b> was studied cross-sectionally in 729 individuals 8 − 30 years old in Leyte, The Philippines. Three stool specimens were examined in duplicate for helminth eggs. Hemoglobin, fecal occult blood loss, and anemia were measured and related to the presence and intensity of helminths. Multivariate models were made to adjust for con-founding by other helminths and SES. In multivariate models, hemoglobin significantly decreased with increasing infection intensity of S. japonicum, hookworm, and T. trichuria (P < 0. 0031, P < 0. 0001, and P < 0. 0001, respectively). Individuals with higher intensities S. japonicum and T. trichuria were significantly more likely to be fecal occult positive (odds ratio [OR] 3. 54; P 0. 008 and OR 2. 68; P 0. 013, respectively), although this was not true for individuals with hookworm.

40|$|Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a {{term for}} a group of genetic {{disorders}} characterized by the production of hemoglobin <b>S,</b> <b>anemia,</b> and acute and chronic tissue damage. Primarily African Americans are affected by SCD in the United States with an estimated incidence of 1 in every 375 live births for the most common form, homozygous SS disease (Sickle Cell Disease Guideline Panel, 1993). The course and severity of SCD are highly unpredictable. Morbidity and complications directly impact {{the quality of life of}} affected individuals and their families. A diagnosis of SCD no longer means an early death. The average life span of a person with SS disease has increased from about 14 years in 1973 to a median age of death in the 19902 ̆ 7 s among males at 42 years and females at 48 years (Bloom, 1995; Platt et al., 1994).

Little is known about factors that may influence this process and enable adolescents to achieve successful transition.

There are currently no published data on the experiences of patients with FA and their families; the psychosocial needs of the siblings of affected patients are unknown. This qualitative descriptive study examined the experiences of siblings of patients with FA. This research was conducted as a sub-study of an ongoing, Institutional Review Board-approved National Cancer Institute protocol entitled, “Etiologic Investigation of Cancer Susceptibility in Inherited Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes. ” Four major dimensions of the sibling experience emerged from the interview data in this study: (1) containment; (2) invisibility; (3) worry; and (4) despair. For each of these dimensions, different aspects are supported by direct quotations obtained from siblings during in-person interviews.

Clinical symptoms in sickle cell patients with high levels of hemoglobin F is reportedly mild, and this has been supported by this study.

All participants were treated at baseline and followed up every 3 months {{for a total of}} 18 months. At each follow-up, participants provided stools to quantify reinfection and venous blood samples for hemograms and measures of iron status and inflammation. After 18 months, reinfection with S. japonicum was associated with a lower mean hemoglobin level (− 0. 39 g/dl; 95 % confidence interval [95 % CI], − 0. 63 to − 0. 16) and 1. 70 (95 % CI, 1. 10 to 2. 61) times higher odds of all-cause anemia than those without reinfection.

Iron replacement led first to a substantially improved hemoglobin concentration with only a minimal increase in the hemolytic rate and secondarily to a modest further improvement in the hemoglobin concentration and a marked increase in the hemolytic rate.
