40|$|Cloud-to-ground {{lightning}} strikes produce natural {{glasses on the}} surface of the Earth, called fulgurites. These natural glasses are tubular in shape with a central void surrounded by an inner glass, and the inner glass is surrounded by an outer crust or toasted region. Previous studies report different kinds of melts existing in several different types of fulgurites; however, little to no chemical data has been collected that tracks chemical variations from the inner glass to the outer crust of a fulgurite. This study uses microprobe and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer analytical techniques to collect transects of chemical composition from the inner glass to the outer crust of eleven fulgurites. Five of the eleven fulgurite samples show a well-mixed, volatile-depleted inner glass, enclosed in a poorly mixed volatile enriched outer melt, suggesting that these fulgurites formed from the vaporization and condensation of materials on the inner fulgurite wall. The remaining six fulgurites show poorly mixed melts in both the inner glass and outer crust regions, and most likely originated as lightning-produced melting phenomena. These data suggest that certain enigmatic natural glasses, such as Edeowie, Dakhleh and other unknown <b>desert</b> <b>glasses,</b> may be lightning-produced, in contrast to the meteorite burst or impact related origins that have commonly been propounded...|$|E

Because of its size and hypothesize origin, El-Baz and Ghoneim speculated that the Kebira Crater was the source of Libyan <b>desert</b> <b>glass</b> that is found scattered over about 6500 km2 within the Great Sand Sea in western Egypt and near the Libyan border. Aboud also suggested that if the Kebira Crater is an impact structure, it might be the solution to the mystery about the source of Libyan <b>desert</b> <b>glass.</b> However, he cautioned that origin of this feature was still largely conjecture that required additional research to confirm. Ramirez-Cardona and others also suggested that the Kebira Crater might be the source of Libyan <b>desert</b> <b>glass.</b> Instead of proposing that Libyan <b>desert</b> <b>glass</b> was ejected from this feature by an impact, they hypothesized that it was transported from it by a Oligocene-Miocene Gilf River system that contained the Kebira Crater within its drainage basin. They also noted that evidence for the Kebira Crater being an impact structure lacked direct field observations. Most recently, Longinelli and others studied the oxygen isotope and chemical composition of Libyan <b>desert</b> <b>glass</b> and samples of sands and sandstone from its proposed source areas. They found that the mean oxygen isotope values of the sandstone samples from the Kebira Crater differed greatly from their Libyan <b>desert</b> <b>glass</b> samples.

40|$|The {{following}} example {{deals with}} methods of determining major and trace {{elements in a}} particular special kind of natural glasses - tektites. Measurements were performed on seventeen samples. Two of them belonged {{to a group of}} Libyan <b>desert</b> <b>glass</b> and the remaining fifteen were originally from the Australasian tektite field. For these purposes, optical microscopy was used in the preparatory phase of study of the samples. The studied samples were prepared in the form of cross-sections. Microscopy was employed to ensure the correctness of the procedure for selecting appropriate samples and precise areas of cross-sections that are suitable for analysis. The main elements were determined by electron microanalysis. The values obtained in these measurements confirmed existing knowledge about the composition of tektites. The chemistry of Libyan <b>desert</b> <b>glass</b> corresponded to 98 weight percent of SiO 2. In the Australian-Asian samples, this value was equal to 73 wt. %.

For the Aouelloul glass, both BSE and CL images show distinct brightness contrast, and the CL images for the Libyan <b>desert</b> <b>glass</b> show spectacular flow textures that are not visible in any other microscopic method. Compositional data show that the SiO 2 composition is relatively higher and the Al 2 O 3 content is lower in the CL-bright areas than in the CL-dark regions. The different appearance of the three glass types in the CL images indicates different peak temperatures during glass formation: the tektite was subjected to the highest temperature, and the Aouelloul impact glass experienced a relatively low formation temperature, while the Libyan <b>desert</b> <b>glass</b> preserves a flow texture that is only visible in the CL images, indicating a medium temperature. All IR reflectance spectra show a major band at around 1040 to 1110 cm- 1 (antisymmetric stretching of SiO 4 tetrahedra), with minor peaks between 745 and 769 cm- 1 (Si-O-Si angle deformation). Broad bands at 491 and 821 cm- 1 in the Raman spectra in all samples are most likely related to diaplectic glass remnants, indicating early shock amorphization followed by thermal amorphization. The combination of these spectroscopic methods allows us to deduce information about the peak formation temperature of the glass, and the CL images, in particular, show glass flow textures that are not preserved in other more conventional petrographic images...|$|R

40|$|International audienceResults are {{presented}} of new geological observations and laboratory analyses on Libyan <b>Desert</b> <b>Glass</b> (LDG), a unique {{kind of impact}} glass found in Egypt, probably 28. 5 - 29. 4 million years in age. A new LDG occurrence has been discovered some 50 kilometers southward of the main LDG occurrences in the Great Sand Sea. From Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR) analysis, the molecular structure of LDG is refined and significant differences are shown between LDG specimens and other pure silica glasses (fulgurite, industrial fused quartz and amorphous biogenic silica) {{that are related to}} differences in their structures. The slight variations observed here for the mean Si-O-Si angle between the different glasses are attributed to their thermal histories. With regard to the other glasses analyzed, the LDG infrared spectral parameters point to a higher ratio of discontinuities and defects in the tetrahedral [SiO 4] network. The quantitative mineralogical constitutions of sandstones and quartzites from the LDG geological setting were analyzed by FTIR. Cretaceous sandstones have a specific composition (about 90 wt % quartz, 10 % dickite), clearly different from the Palaeozoic ones (about 90 wt % quartz, but ≥ 7 % kaolinite). It is shown that the reddish silts bearing the LDG are constituted mainly by microquartz enriched with dickite, whose particle size distribution is characteristic of fluvio-lacustrine deposits, probably Oligocene to Miocene in age. The target rocks, most probably quartz sand, resulted from the weathering (loss of the cementing microquartz) of the Cretaceous sandstones from the Gilf Khebir Plateau with deposition in a high energy environmen...|$|R
40|$|Large aerial bursts {{similar to}} the 1908 Tunguska bolide but much larger in {{magnitude}} have surely been responsible for many catastrophic events {{in the history of}} the Earth. Because aer-ial bursts produce shallow (or even negligible) craters, their existence is difficult to document in the geological record. Even aerial bursts as small as Tunguska deposit enough energy to melt, 1 mm of dry soil. Silica-rich glass formed in such melts has the potential to survive in the soil for many Ma, thus a potential indicator of large aerial bursts is glass that was formed as thick regions within silicate melt sheets. The layered tektites from Southeast Asia and the Libyan <b>desert</b> <b>glass</b> may have formed by a combination of sedimentation and downslope flow of silicate melt heated by radiation from large aerial bursts. The alternative, formation of lay-ered tektites as crater ejecta, cannot account for observations such as uniformly high 10 Be con-tents, the orientation of the magnetic remanence field, and the absence of splash-form (e. g., teardrop or dumbbell) tektites in regions where layered tektites are common. The largest as-teroids or comets make craters no matter what their strength. Recent reviews suggest that, for events in the energy range up to 1019 – 1020 J (about two orders of magnitude larger than the Meteor Crater impact), aerial bursts are more likely than cratering events, and the layered tek-tites of Southeast Asia imply the existence of aerial bursts one to two orders of magnitude larger still.

It is well established that the chemical and isotopic composition of tektites is generally identical {{to that of the}} upper terrestrial continental crust. Tektites typically have very low water content, which has generally been explained by volatilization at high temperature; however, the exact mechanism is still debated. Because volatilization can fractionate isotopes, comparing the isotopic composition of volatile elements in tektites with those of their source rocks may help to understand the physical conditions during tektite formation. Interestingly, volatile chalcophile elements (e. g., Cd and Zn) seem to be the only elements for which isotopic fractionation is known so far in tektites. Here, we extend this study to Cu, another volatile chalcophile element. We have measured the Cu isotopic composition for 20 tektite samples from the four known different strewn fields. All of the tektites (except the Muong Nong-types) are enriched in the heavy isotopes of Cu (1. 98 < δ 65 Cu < 6. 99) in comparison to the terrestrial crust (δ 65 Cu ≈ 0) with no clear distinction between the different groups. The Muong Nong-type tektites and a Libyan <b>Desert</b> <b>Glass</b> sample are not fractionated (δ 65 Cu ≈ 0) in comparison to the terrestrial crust. To refine the Cu isotopic composition of the terrestrial crust, we also present data for three geological reference materials (δ 65 Cu ≈ 0).

A simple Rayleigh distillation cannot explain the Cu isotopic data and we suggest that the isotopic fractionation is governed by a diffusion-limited regime. Copper is isotopically more fractionated than the more volatile element Zn (δ 66 / 64 Zn up to 2. 49 ‰). This difference of behavior between Cu and Zn is predicted in a diffusion-limited regime, where the magnitude of the isotopic fractionation is regulated by the competition between the evaporative flux and the diffusive flux at the diffusion boundary layer. Due to the difference of ionic charge in silicates (Zn 2 + vs. Cu+), Cu has a diffusion coefficient that is larger than that of Zn by at least two orders of magnitude.

40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} {{overview of the}} magnetic properties of the four known tektite fields and related fully melted impact glasses (Aouelloul, Belize, Darwin, Libyan <b>desert</b> and Wabar <b>glasses,</b> irghizites, and atacamaites), namely magnetic susceptibility and hysteresis properties as well as properties dependent on magnetic grain-size. Tektites appear to be characterized by pure Fe 2 + paramagnetism, with ferromagnetic traces below 1 ppm. The different tektite fields yield mostly non-overlapping narrow susceptibility ranges. Belize and Darwin glasses share similar characteristics. On the other hand the other studied glasses have wider susceptibility ranges, with median close to paramagnetism (Fe 2 + and Fe 3 +) but with a high-susceptibility population bearing variable amounts of magnetite. This signs a fundamental difference between tektites (plus Belize and Darwin glasses) and other studied glasses in terms of oxygen fugacity and heterogeneity during formation, thus bringing new light to the formation processes of these materials. It also appears that selecting the most magnetic glass samples allows to find impactor-rich material, opening new perspectives to identify the type of impactor responsible for the glass generation...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT] The Eurasian Continent is {{the largest}} {{continent}} on the earth which consists of various kinds of climates and surface conditions such as tropical rain forest, humid temperate climate, <b>desert,</b> steppe, <b>glass</b> land, taiga, tundra and so on. The surface condition which is including vegetation of Eurasian Continent plays very {{important role in the}} formation of global climate. Mongolia {{is one of the largest}} plateau in Eurasian Continent and plays a great role in dry air mass formation and structure change of Baiu front (Kato, 1985, 1987), which is one of the most important phenomena in Asian Monsoon region. Therefore it is very important to investigate the characteristics of climate over Mongolia to clarify its role on the global climate. The purpose of this study is to investigate characteristics of seasonal and diurnal change of surface meteorological elements and surface heat balance. These are very important factor to understand atmosphere-land interaction and air mass formation over Mongolia. Thus, surface meteorological observation has been carried out from 30 September of 1993 up to now, to study the diurnal and seasonal variation of surface meteorological elements by using AANDERA Automatic Weather Station (AWS) in the Baruunkharaa (48 ° 552 ̆ 7 N, 106 ° 42 ̆ 7 E) in the Northern part of Mongolia. The results are summarized as follows: Some abrupt changes of surface meteorological elements are recognized in transitional seasons simultaneously in Baruunkharaa in the Northern part of Mongolia by analyzed AWS data from late September 1993 to mid-November 1994. Abrupt decrease of T (air temperature (20 ℃)), q (specific humidity (2 g/kg)) and abrupt increase of albedo occurred in mid-November 1994, which suggest that abrupt decrease of T and q might be related to surface snow cover. From mid-November to mid-February there might be stable snow cover (albedo was more than 0. 5) on the surface. In this period T was below - 15 ℃ and net radiation expressed negative valu...|$|R
