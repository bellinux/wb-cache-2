40|$|Wh {{questions}} with multiple wh elements pose a special problem within the overall analysis of wh-type constructions. In a language like English, which only allows one wh element {{to be in}} the fronted discourse-prominent position, any additional wh element occupies an “in situ ” position; i. e. the position of the clause-internal grammatical function. 1 As noted at least since Kuno and Robinson (1972), the choice of which wh element is fronted is not free. They cite examples such as the following: (1) a. Who did what? b. Who went where? c. What happened to whom? d. What did you give to whom? (2) a. *What did who do? b. *Where did who go? c. *To whom did what happen? d. *To whom did you give what? / *Who did you give what to? A similar effect obtains in (a subset of) languages which front multiple wh elements, as seen in the following examples from Bulgarian (Bošković 2002 : 354). (3) a. Koj kogo običa? who whom loves ‘Who loves whom?’ b. *Kogo koj običa? whom who loves Expressing the constraint in movement terms, Kuno and Robinson state that a wh element cannot cross over another wh element. Stated this way, the constraint seems rather arbitrary. It becomes even more arbitrary when compared with cases such as the following: (4) a. Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> what? / What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> where? b. When <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> what? / What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> when...|$|E
40|$|Consider the {{following}} utterances: (a) “Hey Dan, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> this [pointing to a cap] at the game?” (b) “Hey Dan, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> this [pointing to a cap] at a game?” Both of these sentences display the three basic types of defi-nite references—the proper noun Dan, the deictic referent this (pointing to a cap {{that both the}} speaker and the listener can see), and anaphora (you and the game). The sentences differ linguistically only {{in their use of}} two small words: the and a, but this difference confers a critical difference in meaning. The use in (a) of the definite article (the game), unlike the use in (b) of an indefinite article (a game), indicates that the speaker has in mind a particular referent that he or she believes the listener can uniquely identify from among other possibili...|$|E

40|$|Many {{decisions}} {{in the lives of}} animals and humans require a fine balance between the exploration of different options and the exploitation of their rewards. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> the advertised car, or <b>do</b> <b>you</b> test drive different models? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> continue feeding from the current patch of flowers, or <b>do</b> <b>you</b> fly off to another one? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> marry your current partner, or try your luck with someone else? The balance required in these situations is commonly referred to as the exploration – exploitation tradeoff. It features prominently {{in a wide range of}} research traditions, including learning, foraging, and decision making literatures. Here, we integrate findings from these and other often-isolated literatures in order to gain a better understand-ing of the possible tradeoffs between exploration and exploitation, and we propose new theoretical insights that might guide future research. Specifically, we explore how potential tradeoffs depend on (a) the conceptualization of exploration and exploitation; (b) the influencing environmental, social, and individual factors; (c) the scale at which exploration and exploitation are considered; (d) the relationshi...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} {{previous}} investigations using context matching (e. g., Gussenhoven 1983) and appropriateness rating tasks (Birch and Clifton 1995, Welby 2003) suggest that English-speaking listeners lack expectations regarding how {{the size of}} a focused constituent (broad versus narrow) can be expressed prosodically in certain constructions. In the present study English-speaking listeners were presented with the same SVO sentence (e. g., I bought a motorcycle) presented in either broad or narrow question contexts, and were asked to rate the prominence of the words in those sentences. In general, listeners reported sentence-final objects to be relatively more prominent than preceding verbs in the test sentences when those sentences were presented in narrow-object (What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy?)</b> rather than broad-VP (What did you do?) or sentence (What happened?) focus contexts. This effect was found to be stronger in Experiment 2, where the answer was a correction. The findings suggest listeners do have expectations about the relationship between {{the size of a}} sentence’s focus constituent and its prosodic realization. It is argued that these expectations are well founded given the listeners’ likely experience with productions of this particular information structural contrast...|$|E

Eventually, the contractor's report arrived at my office. To my great disappointment, the proposed system came along with a multi-million dollar price tag. And, even more disappointing, the system relied on the same technology we already had in place and wouldn't deliver much additional functionality.

50|$|On May 19, 2012, The MOCA LA {{presented}} the series {{as a special}} one-night screening and performance event. In between screenings of video portraits, Israel created three additional interviews with surprise guests Laird Hamilton, Molly Ringwald and Melanie Griffith, {{in front of the}} live audience. Israel’s introduction to each interview is comically well rehearsed and he refuses to acknowledge the interviewee’s responses or ask follow-up questions, no matter how deep or thought-provoking the answers are. Instead, he works through a set of pre-made questions that he has written on flashcards. The questions range from “Are you more sympathetic to vampires or werewolves?” to “What kind of milk <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> at the grocery store?” Avoiding topics directly related to work, Israel's questions are meant to reveal his subjects' personal affects and characteristics. His repetitive performance allows him, as monotone interlocutor, to disappear, and enables the viewer to focus fully on the subject. In this way, Israel considers each episode to be a portrait, its goal, in the traditional sense of portraiture, to capture each subject's likeness.|$|R
