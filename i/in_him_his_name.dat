60|$|See here {{our cause}} of triumph is through Christ Jesus; and God causeth us through him to triumph, first and chiefly, because Christ Jesus hath done our work for us, hath pleased God for our sins, hath spoiled {{the powers of}} darkness.

5000|$|In the 4th {{year of his}} rule, i.e. 1722, the Daudpotas took certain [...] "aggressive measures".

They further trespassed on the parganahs of Shikarpur, Khanpur and other villages, that formed the jagir of Mir Abdul-Wasia Khan and would not give any {{explanation}} to the said Khan.

50|$|The second {{count for}} the perjury charge was {{with regard to}} the {{evidence}} of the appellant that he (the appellant) and the respondent agreed not to start business until the formation of a new Company by the appellant. In his evidence the appellant later corrected himself that this was untrue. The court found that the appellant’s difficulties in giving a straightforward evidence about the formation of the new Company was based on the apparent difficulties or untold problems he faced in his business and, the fact that in one occasion cement was shipped to <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> in Lagos from Germany by the Plaintiff and in another breath cement was shipped to <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the new Company’s name. The court found as a fact that this inconsistency in the shipments of cement accounted to the appellant’s inability to answer the question put to him during cross examination. At any rate the court found that the evidence {{as to whether or not}} the parties were not to start business until the new Company was formed was not material to the question whether the appellant held himself out as the agent personally responsible for monies on all cement sold out to customers on credit.|$|R
60|$|Now, {{the young}} King, journeying towards London too, with Lord Rivers and Lord Gray, came to Stony Stratford, as his uncle came to Northampton, about ten miles distant; and when those two lords {{heard that the}} Duke of Gloucester was so near, they {{proposed}} to the young King that they should go back and greet <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>name.</b> The boy being very willing that they should do so, they rode off and were received with great friendliness, and asked by the Duke of Gloucester to stay and dine with <b>him.</b> <b>In</b> the evening, while they were merry together, up came the Duke of Buckingham with three hundred horsemen; and next morning the two lords and the two dukes, and the three hundred horsemen, rode away together to rejoin the King. Just as they were entering Stony Stratford, the Duke of Gloucester, checking his horse, turned suddenly on the two lords, charged them with alienating from him the affections of his sweet nephew, and caused them to be arrested by the three hundred horsemen and taken back. Then, he and the Duke of Buckingham {{went straight to the}} King (whom they had now in their power), to whom they made a show of kneeling down, and offering great love and submission; and then they ordered his attendants to disperse, and took him, alone with them, to Northampton.|$|R
5000|$|Helikaon is {{the main}} protagonist. He is a Dardanian coming from the region north of Troy. His father is Anchises. Priam is his uncle. He was visited by Odysseus when he was very young when {{he was known as}} Aeneas. A few that were close to him called him Helikaon, much to the {{annoyance}} of his father. He commented that he wanted to sail {{to the ends of the}} world. Odysseus agreed to visit him again but didnt intend on doing so. Losing his mother later on in his childhood, he became emotionally starved and never left his room, his father becoming increasingly cold towards him. Eventually, Odysseus did return but by then, Helikaon was already emotionally crippled. In order to bring back what Helikaon had been he pretends he is unable to swim and tells Aeneas that there is a hero <b>in</b> <b>him</b> and <b>his</b> <b>name</b> is [...] "Helikaon" [...] and that Helikaon and himself would be waiting at the bottom of a cliff. Odysseus leaps off the high cliff hoping that Aeneas would overcome his fears. Unsure whether he had succeeded or simply scared the youth, Odysseus waits while pretending to drown. Eventually Aeneas overcomes his fears and leaps down to drag Odysseus back onto the Penelope. Odysseus remarks to the crew: [...] "Lads, this is Helikaon. He saved my life."Helikaon went on to establish a large trading fleet of 50 ships. He has a friend named Phaedra with a large estate in Kypros where he resides when he is staying there. He and Odysseus have remained close friends in a father-son relationship. They co-founded the settlement of Seven Hills probably in Italy where large amounts of Tin supply both with wealth. This settlement is strongly implied to be a precursor to Rome, which is famed for its seven hills and according to the Aeneid had its origins in Aeneas and survivors of Troy.Helikaon married Halysia for the good of the kingdom, even though he is in love with Andromache.Helikaon has long black hair and brilliant blue eyes.

The very next morning's post brought him a little note from Ernest Le Breton specially begging <b>him,</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> own <b>name</b> and Edie's, to come down to Calcombe Pomeroy, and officiate as parson at their approaching wedding. The note had cost Ernest a conscientious struggle, for he would have personally preferred to be married at a Registry Office, as being more in accordance with the duties of a good citizen, and savouring less of effete ecclesiastical superstition; but he felt he couldn't even propose such a step to Edie; she wouldn't have considered herself married at all, unless she were married quite regularly by a duly qualified clerk in holy orders of the Church of England as by law established. Already, indeed, Ernest was beginning to recognise with a sigh that {{if he was going to}} live in the world at all, he must do so by making at least a partial sacrifice of political consistency.

50|$|As an {{engineer}} Colonel Flad was remarkable for his great fertility of invention. For every new problem {{he had not}} only one but many solutions and the rapidity with which he grasped all its conditions and framed his plans to meet them amounted to genius. In doing this he was not limited by precedent but looked instinctively for new and better methods than any before known. In boldness and originality he has had but few equals {{in the annals of}} the profession. And like the most successful workers in every field he delighted in his work for its own sake. Nothing could exceed the interest with which he attacked a new problem and he gave himself no rest until he had solved it. The solution once found however the whole subject ceased to interest him and he passed on to something new. This trait is illustrated by the fact that although he took out numerous patents for new and useful inventions to their introduction and utilization he gave no thought. It was the work rather than its rewards for which he cared. As a man he was equally great. His unassuming modesty, his perfect candor, and simplicity, his unflinching courage, his absolute fidelity to his convictions, his single minded subordination of personal to the public welfare, qualities which were written in every line of his face and manifested in every act of his life, all stamped him as a man of the highest type. No one who knew <b>him</b> but believed <b>in</b> <b>him</b> without limit. <b>His</b> <b>name</b> was a synonym for fidelity and skill and all knew that every work committed to his charge would be well done and come from his hand as sound and flawless as the man himself. This evident and perfect integrity of purpose made his public service a legacy of incalculable value to his fellow citizens. His life was a demonstration of how honorable the public service could be made and is an encouragement to those who have not yet lost faith in the possibility of having this service in all its branches lifted to the same standard to abate no jot of heart or hope but still work on for the accomplishment of this high end. To us his fellows in his chosen calling <b>his</b> <b>name</b> and example are specially precious For <b>in</b> <b>him</b> was realized the highest ideal of the engineer, a man of trained intellect controlled by an iron will and directed to the noblest public ends And the fact of his success in attaining this ideal will inspire others to frame their lives upon the same noble lines.|$|R
