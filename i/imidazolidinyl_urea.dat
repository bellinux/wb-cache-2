40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to study the neutralization efficacy of a universal neutralizer proposed by the CTPA on a range of antimicrobial agents and its potential toxicity for microorganisms that are used for antimicrobial preservation testing. Several types of antimicrobial agents including a mixture of methylisothiazolinone and its 5 -chloro derivative, dimethylol dimethyl hydantoin, Quaternium- 15 ®, Bronopol®, benzalkonium chloride, phenoxyethanol, methyl and propyl paraben, chlorhexidine, <b>imidazolidinyl</b> <b>urea,</b> triclosan and thiomersal built-in pharmaceutical, cosmetic or health care products, as well as 6 types of these antimicrobials, i. e. a combination of methyl paraben (0. 18 % w/v) and propyl paraben (0. 02 %), <b>imidazolidinyl</b> <b>urea</b> (0. 3 %), chlorhexidine (0. 01 %), benzalkonium chloride (0. 02 %), Bronopol® (0. 1 %) and thiomersal (0. 02 %) in their pure and soluble form were tested. Validation of microbial recovery was carried out according to the US Pharmacopeia 27 guidelines. The universal neutralizer could inactivate all the studied antimicrobial agents against different strains tested except Staphylococcus aureus. With regards to this microorganism, only seven preservative chemicals consisting of parabens, dimethylol dimethyl hydantoin, Quaternium- 15 ®, Bronopol®, benzalkonium chloride, Phenonip® and <b>imidazolidinyl</b> <b>urea</b> were effectively inactivated. In addition, a pure solution of 0. 02 % thiomersal retained its antimicrobial properties against all studied microorganisms. The neutralizer solution showed no toxicity on any of the test organisms.

40|$|Introduction: Occupational {{allergic}} {{contact sensitization}} {{is common in}} dental personnel. Some {{of the most common}} occupational allergens in dental practice are some formaldehyde-releasers, formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde. Aim: The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the rate of contact sensitization to formaldehyde, quaternium- 15, <b>imidazolidinyl</b> <b>urea,</b> diazolidinyl urea, and to glutaraldehyde in students of dental medicine and dental patients. Material and methods: A total of 50 participants were included in the study: 40 students of dental medicine exposed to formaldehyde-releasers, formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde during the course of their education; 10 dental patients without occupational exposure to the latter substances served as a control group. All of them were patch-tested with the studied allergens. Results: The sensitization rate to formaldehyde was significantly higher in the group of dental patients if compared to the one of dental students (χ 2 = 5. 37; p= 0. 021). Positive skin patch test reactions to quaternium- 15 and to <b>imidazolidinyl</b> <b>urea</b> were observed only in the group of dental students. A significantly higher rate of sensitization to diazolidinyl urea, if compared to the one to <b>imidazolidinyl</b> <b>urea</b> (χ 2 = 5. 4; p= 0. 02) and to quaternium- 15 (χ 2 = 6. 76; p= 0. 009), as well as to glutaraldehyde, if compared to the one to quaternium- 15 (χ 2 = 3. 96; p= 0. 04) for the whole studied population was established. For the whole studied population, significantly increased rate of concomitant sensitization to formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde (χ 2 = 6. 18 p= 0. 013), as well as to diazolidinyl urea and to glutaraldehyde was established (χ 2 = 9. 12 p= 0. 003). Conclusions: We consider the importance of exposure to diazolidinyl urea, quaternium- 15, <b>imidazolidinyl</b> <b>urea</b> and glutaraldehyde during the course of practical education in dentistry for the onset of sensitization. The exposure to formaldehyde is ubiquitous and is difficult to distinguish the roles of environmental and occupational exposures. The promotion of proper personal protection as well as adequate information on occupational chemical hazards should start as early as during the first years of education in dentistry...|$|E

40|$|Background: Preservatives {{present in}} {{cosmetics}} and other industrial products can cause allergic contact dermatitis. The {{aim of the}} study was to assess the frequency of allergy to selected preservatives in consecutive patients examined due to contact dermatitis in the Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine, Łódź, and to establish whether individuals sensitized to formaldehyde react simultaneously to formaldehyde releasers. Material and Methods: A group of 405 patients (308 females and 97 males) was examined in 2011 – 2013. In all participants patch tests with a series of 13 preservatives (paraben mix, formaldehyde, Quaternium 15, chloromethylisothiazolinone/methylisothiazolinone mix, methyldibromoglutaronitrile, diazolidinyl urea, <b>imidazolidinyl</b> <b>urea,</b> DMDM hydantoin, 2 -bromo- 2 -nitropropane- 1, 3 -diol, iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, benzalkonium chloride, sodium metabisulfite, produced by Chemotechnique Diagnostics, Sweden) were performed. Results: Of the 405 patients 74 (including 52 females) showed positive results of patch tests. Contact allergy to at least 1 preservative was noted in 47 (11. 6 %) patients, including 34 (11 %) females and 13 (13. 4 %) males. Methylisothiazolinone proved to be the most frequent sensitizer – 4. 7 % (5. 2 % females, 3. 1 % males) while parabens, 2 -bromo- 2 -nitropropane- 1, 3 -diol and <b>imidazolidinyl</b> <b>urea</b> (0. 2 %) were found to be the least frequent. Fourteen (3. 4 %) participants, 10 women and 4 men, were allergic to formaldehyde and/or formaldehyde releasers. In 11 (78. 6 %) of them monovalent hypersensitivity was observed. In 13 (3. 2 % of the examined group) patients allergy to preservatives might have been of occupational origin. Conclusions: Preservatives, particularly isothiazolinones, are significant causal factors of allergic contact dermatitis, including occupational cases. Individuals sensitized to formaldehyde may react simultaneously to formaldehyde releasers, however, such reactions are relatively rare. Med Pr 2015; 66 (3) : 327 – 33...|$|E
40|$|The {{preservatives}} <b>imidazolidinyl</b> <b>urea</b> (IMID, Germall 115) and diazolidinyl urea (DU, Germall II) {{are commonly}} used in cosmetic products and are well-known sensitizers. The aim {{of the present study}} was to establish the optimal patch test concentration in hydrophilic dried-in vehicle (TRUE Test) for IMID and DU. 181 patients were included in the study. Of these, 150 were patients referred for patch testing, 12 were patients with known allergy to IMID and 19 were patients with known allergy to DU. 76 consecutive patients and the 12 IMID-allergic patients were patch tested with a dilution series IMID (0 to 600 microg/cm(2)), formaldehyde (180 microg/cm(2)) and DU (200 microg/cm(2)). 74 consecutive patients and the 19 DU-allergic patients were patch tested with a dilution series of DU (0 to 600 microg/cm(2)), formaldehyde (180 microg/cm) and IMID (200 microg/cm(2)). A positive dose-response relationship was found. The number of doubtful reactions decreased with increasing test concentrations. No late reactions were observed.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} possible synergistic antimicrobial interactions between common cosmetic preservatives and selected essential oils or surfactants. The antimicrobial efficacy of six essential oils, three surfactants and five preservatives against Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 43387 was assessed by a broth micro-dilution assay. MICs for individual and combined antimicrobials were determined and then transformed to fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indexes. All essential oils exhibited antibacterial activity; among surfactants, bacteria resulted most susceptible to the cationic agent. Synergy was observed when essential oils of eucalyptus and mint were combined with methylparaben against P. aeruginosa, while essential oils of mint, oregano and sage combined with propylparaben and <b>imidazolidinyl</b> <b>urea</b> acted against S. aureus. Many binary mixtures of preservatives and surfactants produced synergistic activity with the most effective interactions involving the cationic and amphoteric compounds under study. FIC indexes demonstrated synergistic effects when preservatives were combined with either essential oils or surfactants against both bacterial strains. These results highlight the potential usefulness of essential oils and surfactants to enhance the activities of conventional biocides. This kind of study should contribute to the selection and optimization of preservative systems for cosmetic preparations...|$|E
40|$|From February 1989 to January 1990, the Swiss Contact Dermatitis Research Group {{conducted}} a 1 -year study {{to examine the}} frequency of sensitization {{to a series of}} 13 common preservatives. A group of 2295 consecutive outpatients with suspected allergic contact dermatitis (age range 7 - 90 years, {{with a mean age of}} 42; 911 males, 1384 females) was tested. The %s of positive reactions to the preservatives studied are as follows, in descending order: formaldehyde 5. 7 %, benzalkonium chloride 5. 5 %, Kathon CG 5. 5 %, thimerosal 4. 2 %, chlorhexidine digluconate 2. 0 %, DMDM hydantoin 1. 7 %, paraben mix 1. 7 %, chloroacetamide 1. 5 %, Bronopol 1. 2 %, <b>imidazolidinyl</b> <b>urea</b> 1. 0 %, quaternium 15 1. 0 %, triclosan 0. 8 %, 2, 4 -dichlorobenzyl alcohol 0. 4 %. These relatively high values suggest a heavy exposure of the Swiss population to topical preservatives. Compared to previous studies, the sensitization rate to Kathon CG has stabilized in Switzerland over the last 2 years. Sensitization to formaldehyde portrayed impressive geographical variation, with sensitization rates up to 9 % in western and only 3 % in eastern Switzerland. The low sensitization rate to parabens argues for their inclusion in a medicament or preservative series, rather than in the standard series...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the second}} part of an article on formaldehyde-releasers in cosmetics. The patch test {{relationship}} between the releasers in cosmetics to formaldehyde contact allergy is reviewed and it is assessed whether products preserved with formaldehyde-releasers may contain enough free formaldehyde to pose a threat to individuals with contact allergy to formaldehyde. There is a clear relationship between positive patch test reactions to formaldehyde-releasers and formaldehyde contact allergy: 15 % of all reactions to 2 -bromo- 2 -nitropropane- 1, 3 -diol and 40 - 60 % of the reactions to the other releasers are caused by a reaction to the formaldehyde in the test material. There is only fragmented data on the amount of free formaldehyde in cosmetics preserved with formaldehyde donors. However, all releasers (with the exception of 2 -bromo- 2 -nitropropane- 1, 3 -diol, for which adequate data are lacking) can, in the right circumstances of concentration and product composition, release > 200 p. p. m. formaldehyde, which may result in allergic contact dermatitis. Whether this is actually the case in any particular product cannot be determined from the ingredient labelling. Therefore, we recommend advising patients allergic to formaldehyde to avoid leave-on cosmetics preserved with quaternium- 15, diazolidinyl urea, DMDM hydantoin, or <b>imidazolidinyl</b> <b>urea,</b> acknowledging that many would tolerate some products...|$|E
40|$|In {{this part}} of a series of review {{articles}} on formaldehyde-releasers and their relationship to formaldehyde contact allergy, formaldehyde-releasers in cosmetics are discussed. In this first part of the article, key data are presented including frequency of sensitization and of their use in cosmetics. In Europe, low frequencies of sensitization have been observed to all releasers: 2 -bromo- 2 -nitropropane- 1, 3 -diol 0. 4 - 1. 2 %, diazolidinyl urea 0. 5 - 1. 4 %, <b>imidazolidinyl</b> <b>urea</b> 0. 3 - 1. 4 %, quaternium- 15 0. 6 - 1. 9 % (for DMDM hydantoin no recent data are available). All releasers score (far) higher prevalences in the USA; the possible explanations for this are discussed. The relevance of positive patch test reactions has been insufficiently investigated. In the USA, approximately 20 % of cosmetics and personal care products (stay-on products: 17 %, rinse-off products 27 %) contain a formaldehyde-releaser. The use of quaternium- 15 is decreasing. For Europe, there are no comparable recent data available.

40|$|Allergic contact {{dermatitis}} (ACD) is a cell-mediated immune response that involves skin sensitization {{in response to}} contact with various allergens. Angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis both play roles in the allergic sensitization process. Epidermal keratinocytes can produce vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in response to UV irradiation and during wound healing. However, the effect of haptenic chemical allergens on the VEGF production of human keratinocytes, which is the primary contact site of toxic allergens, has not been thoroughly researched. We systematically investigated whether immune-regulatory cytokines and chemical allergens {{would lead to the}} production of VEGF in normal human keratinocytes (NHKs) in culture. VEGF production significantly increased when NHKs were treated with IFN-gamma, IL- 1 alpha, IL- 4, IL- 6, IL- 17 A, IL- 22 or TNF alpha. Among the human sensitizers listed in the OECD Test Guideline (TG) 429, we found that CMI/MI, DNCB, 4 -phenylenediamine, cobalt chloride, 2 -mercaptobenzothiazole, citral, HCA, cinnamic alcohol, <b>imidazolidinyl</b> <b>urea</b> and nickel chloride all significantly upregulated VEGF production in NHKs. In addition, common human haptenic allergens such as avobenzone, formaldehyde and urushiol, also induced the keratinocyte-derived VEGF production. VEGF upregulation by pro-inflammatory stimuli, IFN gamma, DNCB or formaldehyde is preceded by the production of IL- 8, an acute inflammatory phase cytokine. Lymphangiogenic VEGF-C gene transcription was significantly increased when NHKs were treated with formaldehyde, DNCB or urushiol, while transcription of VEGF-A and VEGF-B did not change. Therefore, the chemical allergen-induced VEGF upregulation is mainly due to the increase in lymphangiogenic VEGF-C transcription in NHKs. These results suggest that keratinocyte-derived VEGF may regulate the lymphangiogenic process during the skin sensitization process of ACD. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
