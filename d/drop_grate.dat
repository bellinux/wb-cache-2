50|$|The firebox was {{specially}} designed to Tilney's specifications {{to cope with}} the high percentage of clinker and ash content of Colonial coal from the Stormberg Range. A large drop-grate which occupied approximately half of the firebox area, with specially-designed sawtooth-shaped firebars, was arranged at {{the front end of the}} firebox. The firebars could be vibrated by a hand-operated lever in the cab, while the <b>drop</b> <b>grate</b> was controlled by two chains, fitted at each end and also manipulated from the cab.|$|E
50|$|The Class 10 was of an {{extremely}} advanced {{design for the}} day. At 7 ft long, the firebox was somewhat shorter than usual practice, but much wider at 6 ft. It had a rocking firegrate with a <b>drop</b> <b>grate</b> at the front. The rocking grate was operated by a small steam cylinder of 4 in bore and 6 in stroke, arranged under the footplate. This arrangement became standard practice on all new locomotives, except on those equipped with mechanical stokers where it was found preferable to divide the grate into sections which could be shaken separately by hand gear.|$|E
50|$|This {{combustion}} chamber pre-dated the Gaines type, which was practically identical, by four years. The Gaines type {{was introduced in}} the United States of America in 1908 and became widely used on American locomotives. The firebox, of which the external dimensions were 9 ft long and 6 ft wide, was arranged with finger bars and <b>drop</b> <b>grates</b> with a hopper-type ashpan.|$|R
5000|$|Designed for British conditions, the 8Fs {{were not}} really suited to Turkish circumstances. Though large for British engines, they were underpowered by Turkish {{standards}} and so could not ascend the steep grades unassisted. Their lack of <b>drop</b> <b>grates</b> also prevented them from long-distance working. They were thus relegated to shunting and local trip freights. The Turkish railwaymen referred to them as [...] "Churchills" [...] after British prime minister Winston Churchill.|$|R
5000|$|Its round-topped firebox {{was fitted}} with eight {{flexible}} cross-stays {{at the front}} end. The inner firebox was of steel instead of copper {{and it had a}} hopper type ashpan, fitted with an efficient arrangement of drench pipes. The ashpan doors were steam-operated with provision for hand operation when required. The finger bar fire grate was operated by two steam shaker cylinders and had two <b>drop</b> <b>grates.</b> The boiler pressure was [...] higher than that of the Class GE and it had a larger superheater area with 36 elements and incorporating a multiple valve regulator. The locomotive had a self-cleaning smokebox and was fitted with a spark arrester.|$|R
2500|$|The {{clinkers}} {{spill out}} at the end of the cylinder. A tall flue-gas stack, fan, or steam jet supplies the needed draft. Ash <b>drops</b> through the <b>grate,</b> but many particles are carried along with the hot gases. The particles and any combustible gases may be combusted in an [...] "afterburner".|$|R
50|$|Millholland's inventions and {{contributions}} include the cast-iron crank axle, wooden spring, plate girder bridge, poppet throttle, anthracite firebox, water <b>grate,</b> <b>drop</b> frame, and steel tires. He {{was also an}} early user and advocate of the superheater, the feedwater heater, and the injector. Several of his innovations were adopted as standard practice by the railroad industry.|$|R
40|$|An animal feeder {{for use in}} a {{metabolic}} cage is introduced. The feeder includes a confined passageway and an adjustable notched gate proceeding a food cup. The gate is adjusted so that the entry area to the food cup approximates the cross sectional head area of the animal. Food ejected from the food cup by a caged animal is <b>dropped</b> through a <b>grate</b> into a spill tray...|$|R
