40|$|AbstractThe study {{attempts}} {{to investigate the}} robust factors that influence Muslim users’ behavioural intention to use e-commerce transactions by empirically examining the causal link between perceived security and privacy, perceived risks and perceived trust with behavioral intention to use e-commerce. Sample is drawn using stratified random sampling taken from all over Malaysia. Using Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), this research tries to look at different perspective, whereby the respondents are among Muslims who are obliged to follow the Shariah principles. The four major forbidden elements in buying & selling which are Riba’, Gharar, Maysir and Zulm {{are believed to be}} their <b>fundamental</b> <b>judgment</b> in dealing with e-commerce transactions. Results of Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) demonstrate that perceived security and privacy as well as perceived risks have a significant relationship with behavioral intention, while perceived trust shows contrary result. The research findings would be useful for companies that engage in e-commerce to design business strategies to cater Muslim users who form one of the largest populations in e-commerce...|$|E
40|$|At {{every waking}} moment, one’s mode of {{attention}} is situated {{at some point}} on a spectrum ranging from experiencing, where attention is directed toward percep-tions and cognitions related to the immediate physical environment, to mind-wan-dering, where attention is directed toward thoughts, feelings, and daydreams that are decoupled from the environment. Across five studies, the authors propose and find that people in an experiencing (vs. mind-wandering) mode place more impor-tance on detecting change in their environment, which leads them to prioritize at-tention toward changeable stimuli (like price) and subsequently afford such stimuli greater weight in judgments and decisions. The research not only uncovers a novel stimuli characteristic—changeability—important in both the domain of atten-tion modes and judgments but also diverges from the typical characterization of price as a salient cue or heuristic to generate {{a unique set of}} findings based on pri-ce’s inherently changeable nature. More broadly, the findings highlight a way in which consumers ’ <b>fundamental</b> <b>judgment</b> and decision-making processes are shaped by cognitive mechanisms designed for the physical world...|$|E
40|$|John Rawls {{believed}} that capturing our moral sense was {{the goal of}} moral philosophy. Deontology, Consequentialism, and Virtue ethics are the three main attempts at capturing our moral sense. Deontology, consequentialism and virtue ethics focus on the act, the consequence, and character respectively. In doing so, they open themselves up to intuitive counterexamples because the brain makes <b>fundamental</b> <b>judgments</b> on actions, consequences, and character. This means our moral sense is inconsistent. As such we should give up consistency as a requirement for moral theories, and allow for a moral grey area. Moreover, we should be careful in using thought experiments to attack rival theories as they are likely the result of error prone heuristics. I argue this by invoking recent work in psychology, neuroscience, and evolutionary psychology...|$|R

This article is based on a review of the most common grading policies that purport to be criteria‐based. The analysis shows that there is no common understanding of what criteria‐based means or what it implies for practice. This has inhibited high‐quality discourse, research and development among scholars and practitioners. Additionally, the concepts of ‘criteria’ and ‘standards’ are often confused and, despite the use of criteria, the <b>fundamental</b> <b>judgments</b> teachers make about the quality of student work remain subjective and substantially hidden from the students’ view.

2500|$|As {{with other}} {{meanings}} of common sense, for the Romans {{of the classical}} era [...] "it designates a sensibility shared by all, from which one may deduce a number of <b>fundamental</b> <b>judgments,</b> that need not, or cannot, be questioned by rational reflection". But even though Cicero did at least once use the term in a manuscript on Plato's Timaeus (concerning a primordial [...] "sense, one and common for all [...] connected with nature"), he and other Roman authors did not normally {{use it as a}} technical term limited to discussion about sense perception, as Aristotle apparently had in De Anima, and as the Scholastics later would in the Middle Ages. Instead of referring to all animal judgment, it was used to describe pre-rational, widely shared human beliefs, and therefore it was a near equivalent to the concept of humanitas. This was a term that could be used by Romans to imply not only human nature, but also humane conduct, good breeding, refined manners, and so on. Apart from Cicero, Quintilian, Lucretius, Seneca, Horace and some of the most influential Roman authors influenced by Aristotle's rhetoric and philosophy used the Latin term [...] "sensus communis" [...] in a range of such ways. As C. S. Lewis wrote: Quintilian says it is better to send a boy to school than to have a private tutor for him at home; for if he is kept away from the herd (congressus) how will he ever learn that sensus which we call communis? (I, ii, 20). On the lowest level it means tact. In Horace the man who talks to you when you obviously don't want to talk lacks communis sensus.|$|R

40|$|The present {{series of}} {{experiments}} used factorial designs to evaluate which acoustic features are primarily responsible for the voicing distinction in the syllables Izil and Isi/. Increases in frication duration tend to make the syllable more voiceless only if vocal cord vibration is absent or at a very low level during the frication period. Increasing the period between the onset of frication and the onset of vocal cord vibration changes the syllable from a predominantly voiced to a predominantly voiceless sound. This period, called voice onset time, can account for the change in perception regardless of simultaneous changes in the total frication duration or the relative duration of the frication period that contains vocal cord vibration. Changes in fundamental frequency had a large influence on the voicing <b>judgments.</b> With low <b>fundamental</b> frequencies, the <b>judgments</b> were predominantly voiced, whereas with high <b>fundamental</b> frequencies, voiceless <b>judgments</b> were predominant.

This article {{argues that the}} popular characterization of economics as “value-neutral” obscures {{the fact that there}} are <b>fundamental</b> value <b>judgments</b> in any framework influenced by economics. Acknowledging this fact will shift the terms of the debate: instead of a “neutral” policy and one that “imposes values,” we see that both policies in fact entail values imposition to some extent. The public discourse is thus rendered more intellectually honest. 	The article progresses in three parts. First, I describe the concept of “merit goods. ” This concept, introduced fifty years ago, has met with resistance from traditional economists because it justifies interference with individuals’ preferences and imposing values, something economics ostensibly rejects. Second, I show that the merit goods concept nonetheless can be used to clarify U. S. Supreme Court cases regarding regulatory takings, indicating that values imposition is not just a theoretical matter. Finally, I survey the writings of Hayek, Nozick, Buchanan, and Posner to show that even those authors who claim to be true to the principles of economics nonetheless have elements in their theory that involve imposition of certain values — that is, involve merit goods. 	Merit goods, then, enrich those scholars’ theories, properly describe constitutional reality, and add a needed dimension to economics...|$|R

Having become almost only organized force capable to resist to the new arising statehood, the armed strength of opponents of the Soviet power has tried to play the leading role in political practice of white forces. The assessment of the received results allows understanding with big understanding the reasons of defeat of white forces in Civil war in the east of the country. With coming to power of the admiral A. V. Kolchak in east part of Russia the mode which had to represent individual dictatorship was set. However already the first political steps of opponents of the mode have called into question intentions of the power. The ataman G. M. Semenov who sought to head anti-Bolshevist forces in the region became one of the first opponents of the mode. The first attempts of the new power to bridle the ataman haven't brought positive result. Semenov's performance testified to absence of much-needed unity in camp of opponents of Bolsheviks. For counteraction to opponents of the mode the power used military force. Actually the army became the tool in hands of Kolchak who was used for dictatorship support. Army, without having experience {{of political}} work, I realized installations of the power. In practice of her activity there were receptions of repressive character: arrests, destruction of property, executions.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{two types}} of causative construction in Spanish, referred to here as hacer 1 and hacer 2 constructions. Various properties of these constructions suggest that they should respectively be analyzed as involving ECM and object control. Notwithstanding, hacer 2 constructions contrast with uncontroversial object control constructions {{in terms of the}} object status of the causee, the constituency of the embedded clause, and the interpretation of indefinites. To resolve this paradox, this paper proposes that the hacer 1 /hacer 2 distinction follows from a <b>fundamental</b> difference in <b>judgment</b> types, whereby the embedded clause of an hacer 1 construction represents a THETIC judgment and that of hacer 2 a CATEGORICAL judgment. This is of interest because this distinction is not usually discussed in the context of embedded clauses. I argue that putative control properties of hacer 2 constructions are a consequence of the predication associated with categorical judgments. Furthermore, the interpretive correlates of the thetic/categorical distinction accounts for the interpretation of indefinite causees. In this way, it is possible to posit a single causative predicate, hacer, whose contrasting syntactic and semantic properties follow from the different realizations afforded by this contrast in judgment type...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of biomedicine {{has led to}} the birth of the first test-tube baby in 1978, and that event gave enormous impetus for further {{development of}} biomedically assisted fertilization, but also for the development of supporting legislation. Biomedically assisted fertilization and its application raises sensitive social and moral issues, so states retain their sovereign rights in this area and enact rules and regulations that reflect their national legislative policy. Comparative studies across Europe show that national legal acts are in force in many countries, but differences exist and states persist on them. Legal regulation of biomedically assisted fertilization provides legal security for individuals who are subjected to it, making easier the legal protection in cases where individual rights are violated. This paper presents two recent judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, the subject matter of which are issues of biomedically assisted fertilization, where legal remedy is sought under Article 8 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and <b>Fundamental</b> Freedoms.

40|$|The venerable dual and {{multiprocess}} {{models that}} have guided work on attitudes and social cognition {{for the past}} few decades (see Chaiken & Trope, 1999) have been challenged recently on one hand by those who claim that there is really only one <b>fundamental</b> process of <b>judgment</b> (e. g., Fishbein & Middlestadt, 1995; Kruglanski, Erb, Pierro, Mannetti, & Chun, this issue; Kruglanski & Thompson, 1999) {{and on the other hand}} by advocates of newer systems approaches (e. g., Kahneman, 2003; Lieberman, 2003) that try to subsume the earlier frameworks. Indeed, the claim of some sys-tems theorists is that “the most important strength of dual-system models is their ability to integrate theory and research in the realm of existing dual-process mod-els ” (Deutsch & Strack, this issue, p. 168). In this com-mentary we argue that there is room for both multiprocessandmultisystemapproaches,becausepro-cesses and systems are somewhat distinct beasts (al-though some have used these terms interchangeably; e. g., Kokis, McPherson, Toplak, Stanovich, & West, 2002). If systems and processes are distinct, then it is not clear that systems perspectives make process ap-proaches unnecessary. In this commentary we first reinforce our belief that a single-process framework is not the most fruitful way to account for social judgment (see also Petty, Wheeler, & Bizer, 1999). Next, we examine the evidence for multisystem frameworks and conclude that although it is quite plausible that there are multiple systems that con-tribute to social judgment, the purported criteria for es-tablishing different systems are not entirely convincing. Nevertheless, in accord with Sherman (this issue), we conclude that a consideration of both multiple systems and processes is the way to make the most progress in un-derstanding the judgmental and behavioral phenomena of interest to social psychologists...|$|R

H 577 P BRE 2015 Lawxx, 441 pages :color illustrationsThe {{construction}} industry is often perceived as unethical due to corruption, {{health and safety}} failures, and environment-polluting activities. There is a consensus in the industry that to address these issues, {{as well as to}} ensure a sustainable built environment appropriate corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategies are needed. Although governments and built environment professional bodies have introduced policies and regulations for curbing unethical practices and controlling the impact of construction activities {{it is clear from the}} literature that they are deficient in scope and movement toward CSR and sustainability. It has been widely suggested that CSR and sustainability should be primarily considered from an ethical point of view and that individuals play a significant role in promoting both within their organizations. The aim of this study was therefore to develop a conceptual ethical decision-making model to explain how demographic factors and ethical climate factors affect the moral judgment of construction professionals in ethical decision-making in relation to CSR and sustainability. This was accomplished by undertaking a comprehensive literature review, holding face-to-face interviews, statistically analyzing questionnaire survey data, and designing and validating a profession-specific test instrument of moral judgment for the {{construction industry}}. The researcher's instrument for assessing professional judgment in a construction context, the Construction-specific Moral Judgment Test (CMT), was used in conjunction with an established device for assessing moral reasoning in general, the Defining Issues test- 2 (DIT- 2). Results from analysis of data gathered from 495 construction professionals and students who responded to a questionnaire involving societal and construction-context ethical dilemma vignettes, show that the majority were either 'conventional' thinkers who emphasize pleasing others and are concerned with obeying social norms, or 'post-conventional' thinkers who focus on what is right for all affected and adhere to universal ethical principles. Underpinned by Kohlberg's (1969) cognitive moral development theory and McCuen's (1979) professional conduct development theory, the CMT identified three types of construction-specific moral judgment: pre-professional judgment which is guided by the direct consequences to individuals and puts self first; <b>fundamental</b> professional <b>judgment,</b> which relies on regulations and standards; and principled professional judgment, which is guided by justice and human rights. The results also reveal that demographic factors of age, gender, education and work experience have varying effects on moral judgment development and that ethical climate factors play a part when construction-specific moral judgments are required. Findings from this research will benefit both practitioners and academics in the construction industry by providing objective data on the moral judgment of construction professionals. The newly developed CMT could be used as an ethics assessment tool for continuing professional development training, and could also be incorporated in the curriculum of university construction programs. The study not only contributes to a better understanding of the factors affecting the moral judgment of construction professionals in relation to ethical decision-making, but also provides an indication of the ethical strategies that organizations need to pursue in order to achieve CSR and sustainability.
