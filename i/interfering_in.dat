Britain did not challenge the Union blockade of Confederate ports, and Seward wrote that if Britain continued to avoid <b>interfering</b> <b>in</b> the war, he would not be overly sensitive to what wording they used to describe their policies.|$|E

5|$|After {{a series}} of {{political}} and military machinations conducted by the U.S., the Pathet Lao, and the North Vietnamese in Laos that are described in the History of Laos since 1945, a Declaration on the Neutrality of Laos was signed in Geneva, Switzerland on 23 July 1962. The agreement, an attempt to end a civil war between the Communist-dominated (and Hanoi-directed) Pathet Lao, neutralists, and American-backed rightists, included provisions that required the removal of all foreign military forces and precluded the use of Lao territory for <b>interfering</b> <b>in</b> {{the internal affairs of}} another country – a blatant effort to shut down North Vietnam's growing logistical corridor through southeastern Laos that would become known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail.|$|E

5|$|After {{his failure}} at Constantinople, Maslama was {{dispatched}} to Iraq {{to quell the}} Kharijites. Following Umar's death and the accession of his brother Yazid II in 720, he was tasked with {{the suppression of the}} revolt of Yazid ibn al-Muhallab, whom he defeated and killed in August 720. He nevertheless fell out of favour with the Caliph, who resented and feared his power as governor of both Iraqs, as well as his <b>interfering</b> <b>in</b> the succession: Maslama favoured his brother Hisham over Yazid's son Walid. Yazid soon recalled Maslama from his post, ostensibly because he had failed to deliver his provinces' tax haul to Damascus, and replaced him by his protege, Umar ibn Hubayra.|$|E
5|$|Eric Young got his TNA X Division Championship {{match on}} the November 13 episode of Impact! against then-champion Sheik Abdul Bashir. Though he {{defeated}} {{him to become}} the new champion, a week later the decision was reversed and Young was forced to relinquish the title belt to Bashir due to a controversial ending to their match. Young and Bashir fought for the championship once again at Final Resolution, with referee Shane Sewell <b>interfering</b> <b>in</b> the bout like he had done in the previous encounter, which allowed Young to gain the victory. Afterwards, Management Director Jim Cornette stripped Young of the championship. This set up a tournament for the title, ending at Genesis where Alex Shelley defeated Chris Sabin to become the new champion.|$|E
5|$|In Altranstädt, Marlborough {{reportedly}} approached Carl Piper, {{the most}} favored of the King's advisers of the time. Allegedly, he offered Piper a pension {{in exchange for}} advising Charles XII to invade Russia, as this would distract Charles from <b>interfering</b> <b>in</b> the War of the Spanish Succession. Carl Piper was openly accused of having accepted Marlborough's bribe, persuaded Charles to the Swedish invasion of Russia, which consequently lead to the disastrous Battle of Poltava. Carl Piper denied having accepted Marlborough's offer, but he did admit that he had accepted that Marlborough provided his wife Christina Piper {{with a pair of}} valuable earrings, which she admitted, and as it was the habit of Carl Piper to personally refuse bribes but allow his wife to accept them and then follow her recommendation, the accusation of Marlborough's bribe is not unlikely.|$|E

Fortune posed as clowns to attack various members of Immortal so they wouldn't be able to <b>interfere</b> <b>in</b> the title match that occurred that night, which would ensure Anderson retaining the belt. Fortune was then instructed by Sting to guard the cage during the Angle/Anderson match that occurred on Impact so that Immortal couldn't <b>interfere</b> <b>in</b> that bout either.

5|$|Nathu La {{played a}} vital role in the 1903–1904 British {{expedition}} to Tibet, which sought to prevent the Russian Empire from <b>interfering</b> <b>in</b> Tibetan affairs and thus gaining a foothold in the region. In 1904, Major Francis Younghusband, serving as the British Commissioner to Tibet, led a successful mission through Nathu La to capture Lhasa. This led to the setting up of trading posts at Gyantse and Gartok in Tibet, and gave control of the surrounding Chumbi Valley to the British. The following November, China and Great Britain ratified an agreement approving trade between Sikkim and Tibet.|$|E

T'Jon and Romas are furious at the decision as {{it means that the}} trade between Ornara and Brekka will stop because the freighters can no longer make the trips without the parts. After the four are transported off the Enterprise, Picard confides to Dr. Crusher that while the Ornarans may suffer from withdrawal symptoms in the short term, this will be an opportunity for both races to advance in their own ways.|$|E
