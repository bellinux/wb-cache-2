5|$|An {{expert panel}} of {{engineers}} {{released a report}} outlining concerns regarding the decreased loop ramp radii {{and a lack of}} protective <b>guardrail</b> at sharp curves, in addition to the lack of a concrete median barrier to separate the opposite directions of travel. However, it was also argued that the large grass median was sufficient to prevent cross-over collisions, given that Highway410 has a similar median.|$|E
5|$|The {{court held}} that it was proven that Blythe had thrown Nosek off the stage. However, Blythe, due to his nearsightedness, could have mistaken Nosek for the other fan who had {{repeatedly}} gotten over the <b>guardrail.</b> According to the court, the largest part of the blame lies with the promoters and security members. Judge Kubovec further reproached Blythe for not having met with the Nosek family.|$|E
5|$|Another {{person to}} testify was Robert Havelka, {{who worked as}} a {{security}} guard the night of the incident. Havelka said that the <b>guardrail</b> was too close to the stage, but not so close as to make a platform for climbing the stage. He testified that he pulled one person off the stage and that another person fell off before he could be secured. He further said that the fan's fall might have been helped by someone else, perhaps the singer, though he did not see it precisely.|$|E
50|$|<b>Guardrails</b> {{were being}} used {{for the first time}} in Germany. <b>Guardrails,</b> {{metallic}} corrosion-resistant high-security <b>guardrails</b> developed in the US, prevented the loss of life of tens of thousands. Several international standards have been developed for the production and installation of <b>guardrails,</b> such as EN1317, RAL, and RC6120.|$|R
30|$|This study {{revealed}} that GHG emissions from the wooden <b>guardrails</b> varied with the type: the wooden type no. 3 generated less GHG emissions than did wooden type no. 1. As mentioned in “Overview of <b>guardrails</b> examined in this study”, the findings and tendencies obtained from this study {{can be applied to}} all varieties of wooden <b>guardrails</b> in Japan because the two types in this study can be considered representative of all the wooden <b>guardrails</b> used in Japan. Therefore, {{the findings of this study}} can contribute to promote selection and design of wooden types with lower GHG emissions.|$|R

5|$|Barry dropped {{moderate}} to heavy rainfall across Florida, peaking at 6.99inches (178mm) at Palm Beach International Airport; several other locations reported over 3inches (75mm). The rainfall alleviated persistent drought conditions and assisted in combating severe wildfires across the state. In Brevard County, the rainfall closed {{a portion of}} Eau Gallie Boulevard after a large sinkhole developed. Several other roads across the area were flooded, and on Interstate 95 near Lake Worth, a sinkhole closed two lanes of traffic. Wet roads caused several traffic accidents across the state; in both Brevard and Volusia counties, a motorist was killed from an accident. On Interstate 4, a tractor trailer led to disruptions near Orlando after it crashed into a <b>guardrail.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} leg, on Friday, 2 May, at the seventh {{kilometre}} of the 18th stage, Corte–Taverna, Toivonen's Lancia {{went off the}} side of the road at a tight left corner with no <b>guardrail.</b> The car plunged down a ravine and crashed on its roof. The aluminium fuel tank underneath the driver's seat was ruptured by the trees and exploded. The fuel tank was not protected by a skid plate, an item used mainly on gravel rallies, which was not fitted for the all-asphalt Tour de Corse. The explosion happened within seconds of the crash, and Toivonen and his co-driver, Sergio Cresto would not have time to get out had they still been alive. The fire caused by the explosion was so intense that the Delta S4, built of fast-burning kevlar-reinforced plastic composite, was unidentifiable as a car afterwards. Both Toivonen and Cresto died in their seats. Toivonen left behind wife Erja (married in 1982) and two young children, son Markus and daughter Arla, while Cresto was single with no children.|$|E
5|$|On Saturday, February 7, Murray's father Fred {{arrived in}} Amherst. He told {{investigators}} he and Maura went car-shopping that afternoon and later went {{to dinner with}} a friend of Murray's. Murray dropped her father off at his motel room and, borrowing his Toyota Corolla, she returned to campus to attend a dorm party. She arrived at 10:30 pm. At 2:30 am on Sunday, February 8, she left the party. At 3:30 am, en route to her father's motel, she struck a <b>guardrail</b> on Route 9 in Hadley causing nearly $10,000 worth of damage to her father's car. The responding officer wrote an accident report but there is no documentation of sobriety field tests being conducted. She was driven to her father's motel and stayed in his room the rest of the morning. At 4:49 am, there was a cell phone call placed to Murray's boyfriend from Fred's phone. The participants and content of the phone call are unknown.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of July 18, 1969, Kennedy was at Chappaquiddick Island on {{the eastern end of}} Martha's Vineyard. He was hosting a party that he gave for the Boiler Room Girls, a group of young women who had worked on his brother Robert's ill-fated presidential {{campaign}} the year before. Kennedy left the party with one of the women, 28-year-old Mary Jo Kopechne. Driving a 1967 Oldsmobile Delmont 88, he attempted to cross the Dike Bridge (which did not have a <b>guardrail</b> at that time). Kennedy lost control of his vehicle and crashed in the Poucha Pond inlet, which was a tidal channel on Chappaquiddick Island. Kennedy escaped the overturned vehicle, and, by his description, dove below the surface seven or eight times, vainly attempting to reach and rescue Kopechne. Ultimately, he swam to shore and left the scene, with Kopechne still trapped inside the vehicle. He contacted authorities the next morning, but Kopechne's body had already been discovered.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with six drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. In the first part of qualifying (Q1), the session got interrupted shortly after it had started, as Felipe Nasr came to a halt at the exit of the tunnel, caused by an engine failure. A red flag came out while the car was cleared off the track. When the running resumed, all drivers except for the two at Force India went out on the ultrasoft tyres to set their first lap times. Max Verstappen was the last to set a representative time, but touched the <b>guardrail</b> at the swimming pool chicane and crashed into the wall, causing another red flag period. As the session got back under way, it were the two Manor cars of Rio Haryanto and Pascal Wehrlein, as well as Jolyon Palmer and Marcus Ericsson who joined Nasr and Verstappen on the sidelines, as they were eliminated. Kevin Magnussen meanwhile barely made it into Q2, but was under investigation for exiting the pit lane while it was closed.|$|E
5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was {{defended by}} A.J. Styles against Petey Williams next. Williams was {{accompanied}} by A-1. The duration of the contest was 18 minutes and 20 seconds. Early in the bout, Styles jumped over the top rope to ringside aiming to land on Williams, he instead overshot and crashed into the <b>guardrail.</b> Mid-way through the contest, Styles attempted to perform his signature Styles Clash maneuver, but Williams countered. Afterwards, Williams attempted to perform his signature Canadian Destroyer, but this time Styles counter. Williams held Styles in his signature Sharpshooter submission hold during the encounter. Styles fought out of it by grabbing the bottom rope and forcing it to be released. Samoa Joe interfered in the bout by distracting Styles. Near the end, both men fought on the top rope with Styles getting the advantage. He then set up Williams for his Styles Clash maneuver and jumped off, slamming Williams face-first into the mat from the top rope. Styles followed with a pin, thus winning the match and retaining the TNA X Division Championship.|$|E
30|$|However, in our reading, {{we found}} no {{instances}} of peer-reviewed research papers on the LCA {{of the use of}} wood for <b>guardrails,</b> which is the topic of this research. Although there have been academic presentations by Kayo et al. [9] and Ohkata et al. [10], these did not consider the entire life cycle and did not conduct a sufficient comparison with non-wooden <b>guardrails.</b> Therefore, there has not yet to be a sufficient quantitative evaluation of the GHG emission reduction effect of the use of wood for <b>guardrails.</b>|$|R

5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2016 season, two ninety-minute practice and one sixty-minute session were held before qualifying on Saturday. The first two usually {{take place on}} Friday, with Monaco being the single exemption, where those sessions are held on Thursday, in order to minimise road-closure disruptions to local residents. In the first session on Thursday morning, Lewis Hamilton topped the timesheets {{with a time of}} 1:15.537, one tenth of a second faster than his teammate Nico Rosberg. They were followed by Sebastian Vettel, almost half a second down on Hamilton, and the two Red Bull cars of Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen respectively. Daniil Kvyat, driving for Toro Rosso, in sixth was the last driver to get within a second of Hamilton's time. He {{was the only one of}} the front runners to set his time on the supersoft instead of the faster ultrasoft tyres. There were several incidents during the session: After twenty-four minutes, Felipe Massa hit the barrier in turn one, damaging his car and leading to a virtual safety car (VSC) period. Later, Lewis Hamilton had a brake lockup at the same spot, but was able to get into the run-off area without touching the <b>guardrail.</b> Several other drivers had dangerous moments in turn one as well, but the most severe incident of the session came three minutes to the end: A drain cover had come loose around the first corner, puncturing Rosberg's left rear tyre and damaging Jenson Button's McLaren MP4-31, causing the practice to be red flagged, ultimately ending the session.|$|E
5|$|Samoa Joe {{defended the}} TNA X Division Championship against Christopher Daniels {{in the eighth}} match of the show. Mid-way through the contest, Joe avoided a moonsault by Daniels by casually walking away, a {{trademark}} action of his persona. Daniels earned a near-fall after forcing Joe against the mat with a modified Death Valley Driver {{from the top of}} a padded turnbuckle. Joe followed up with his own near-fall by slamming Daniels back-first against the mat from the turnbuckle with a powerbomb. Daniels then performed his signature Best Moonsault Ever maneuver, gaining another near-fall. Their fight spilled to the ringside area where Joe positioned Daniels' head against the <b>guardrail</b> and kicked it against the rail. This move resulted in Daniels bleeding from the forehead, which Joe targeted {{for the rest of the}} bout. At this time, A.J. Styles came down to the ringside area. Joe performed his signature Muscle Buster maneuver and followed up by attempting to place Daniels in his trademarked Coquina Clutch submission maneuver, which Daniels fought off. Joe then dropped Daniels from the top of a turnbuckle onto a chair and continued to target Daniels' bleeding forehead. With Daniels unconscious in the storyline, A.J. Styles threw in the towel for Daniels to stop the match at 15 minutes and 30 seconds, resulting in Joe being declared the victor.|$|E
5|$|With rain {{shortly before}} the race, the start was taken behind the safety car, forcing all drivers to start the race on the full wet tyres. As Ricciardo led the field behind the safety car, Daniil Kvyat had {{to come into the}} pit lane on lap two, {{complaining}} of technical issues. He rejoined with a new steering wheel, being a lap down {{on the rest of the}} pack already. The race started in earnest on lap seven, with Ricciardo defending his lead at the restart. Kevin Magnussen made a pit stop for intermediate tyres at the end of the lap, but his teammate Jolyon Palmer proved just how slippery it still was when he crashed out just a lap later, being caught out by a wet zebra crossing and causing a virtual safety car period. More cars came into the pitlane for intermediate tyres over the following laps. On lap twelve, Kimi Räikkönen damaged his front wing on the <b>guardrail</b> at the Loews hairpin, resulting in his front wing getting caught under his front tyres, blocking Grosjean's way in the process. Räikkönen retired some corners later. Meanwhile, Ricciardo built a gap at the front, being ten seconds clear of Rosberg on lap 13. One lap later, Sebastian Vettel was the first of the front runners to change to intermediate tyres. Mercedes issued team orders demanding Rosberg let Hamilton past on lap 16, but the gap had by then grown to 13 seconds.|$|E

Even for experienced developers it is tedious, if not impossible, to find and eliminate all vulnerabilities. This paper presents <b>GuardRails,</b> a source-tosource tool for Ruby on Rails that helps developers build secure web applications. <b>GuardRails</b> works by attaching security policies defined using annotations to the data model itself. <b>GuardRails</b> produces a version of the input application that automatically enforces the specified policies. <b>GuardRails</b> helps developers prevent a myriad of security problems including cross-site scripting attacks and access control violations while providing a large degree of flexibility to support a range of policies and development styles. ...|$|R

25|$|Building on {{his first}} <b>guardrail</b> designs, Sicking {{developed}} the first <b>guardrail</b> system capable of safely accommodating light trucks and SUV’s. As {{the center of gravity}} and bumper heights of SUV’s and light trucks increased, pre-1990 guardrails that based their designs on low bumper height vehicles were no longer sufficient. Larger vehicles began to exhibit a tendency to rollover, vault, or rupture guardrails. Sicking led his team to develop a <b>guardrail</b> system that addressed the needs of all vehicle, increasing the rail mounting height, moving rail splices from the posts to the midspan, and increasing blockout depth by four inches. To date, 27 states have adopted this <b>guardrail</b> design, 10 more are currently adopting it, and the remaining 13 have adopted or are evaluating slight variation of this system.|$|E

25|$|Sicking {{has devoted}} {{his career to}} {{designing}} impact energy management systems, specifically focusing on crashworthy safety systems. Sicking has developed numerous “next generation” designs that have significantly reduced the risk of injury and fatality to motorists, from highway drivers to NASCAR racers. His first global success was the ET-2000, the first energy absorbing <b>guardrail</b> terminal – a device that sits over {{the end of a}} <b>guardrail,</b> flattening the <b>guardrail</b> when it is hit by a vehicle. The first study of the device showed that out of 400 crashes, there were three injuries and no fatalities—reducing the risk by a factor of 10. But even with detailed research data and real-world results showing the product a success, Sicking says he gets the most satisfaction from a personal testimonial.|$|E
30|$|The {{service life}} of the <b>guardrails</b> is 10  years, {{according}} to the statutory number of years for depreciation of assets [20]. This service life is thought to reflect the high performance required of <b>guardrails</b> with regard to safety, since they are an important structural item for separating the vehicle road from the sidewalk for traffic safety, and the relatively short time frame for infrastructure upgrades in line with social development. The actual service life of steel <b>guardrails</b> {{has not yet been}} scientifically studied and reported. On the other hand, according to the results of an interview survey of Nippon Steel & Sumikin Metal Products Co. Ltd., there are some cases of steel <b>guardrails</b> that have been in place for over 40  years since their installation. In the case of wooden <b>guardrails,</b> their history is relatively shorter and has not been long enough to clearly establish their service life. On the other hand, it was confirmed that in Kumamoto Prefecture, there are some wooden <b>guardrails</b> that are still maintaining sufficient function after being in place for more than 15  years. Furthermore, the wooden beams of wooden <b>guardrails</b> that had been in place for 10  years in Miyazaki Prefecture were recovered and subjected to strength tests. The result showed that they still retained plenty of function [21]. All of the wood used in these examples was treated with preservatives by pressure injection. Furthermore, the efficacy of pressure injection is influenced by the amount of preservatives inside the wood, and it is known that pressure injection treatment results in a larger amount of chemical agent absorption compared with surface coating treatment [22].|$|R
30|$|The {{preservation}} method {{employed for}} the wooden beams was {{a surface coating}} (type no. 1 : water-based synthetic resin paint; type no. 3 : oil-based paint) when they were initially developed; however, due to occurrence of carpophores and splintering, there were concerns about injury to pedestrians who touched the <b>guardrails.</b> Therefore, more recently newly installed or renewed <b>guardrails</b> are pressure injected with a preservative (ACQ) rather than a surface coating. As of April 2015, both surface-coated and pressure-injected cases are in existence. For wooden <b>guardrails,</b> we therefore investigated both the surface-coated case (hereafter “painted”) and the pressure-injected case (hereafter “pressure-injected”).|$|R
