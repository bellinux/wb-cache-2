5|$|The 17th century Yarn Market is {{a market}} cross which was {{probably}} built in 1609 by the Luttrell family who were the local lords of the manor to maintain {{the importance of the}} village as a market, particularly for wool and cloth. The Yarn Market is an octagonal building constructed around a central pier. The tiled roof provides shelter <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain.</b> The building contains a hole in one of the roof beams, a result of cannon fire in the Civil War. A bell at the top was rung to indicate the start of trading.|$|E

5|$|The market cross was {{probably}} built in 1609 by the Luttrell family {{who were the}} local lords of the manor to maintain {{the importance of the}} village as a market, particularly for wool and cloth. It still bears the damage caused by cannon fire in the Civil War. Nearby was an older cross known as the Butter Cross which has subsequently been moved to the outskirts of the village.

5|$|Dunster {{had become}} a centre for woollen and {{clothing}} production by the 13th century, with the market dating back to at least 1222, and {{a particular kind of}} kersey or broadcloth became known as 'Dunsters'. The prosperity of Dunster was based on the wool trade, with profits helping to pay for the construction of the tower of the Priory Church of St George and provide other amenities. By the 15th century the importance of the town was declining particularly due to the silting up of the harbour. The Luttrell's wanted to maintain the importance as a market and in 1609 George Luttrell, of the Luttrell family constructed the market to shelter traders and their wares <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> and provide more security for their wares. The exact date of construction is debated and a variety of dates are given in different sources, however 1609 is considered the most likely.|$|E
5|$|Isis first {{affected}} Baja California Sur on September 2 as {{a tropical}} storm. Shortly after making landfall, a {{weather reporting station}} at San José del Cabo recorded sustained winds of 26mph (42km/h), and gusts reaching up to 46mph (74km/h). A station on the Islas Marías also reported sustained winds of 54mph (87km/h). The winds left widespread areas without power or telephone. The storm produced heavy rainfall in the southern portion of the peninsula, including a 24‑hour total of 12.99inches (330mm) at Los Cabos and a peak rainfall total of 24.02inches (610mm) at Santiago. A married couple was killed after attempting to cross a flooded stream in Los Cabos. Initially, reports indicated a family was missing in La Paz, though they were later proven false. Flooding from the storm closed all roads {{to the north of}} Los Cabos and caused damage to the roads in the area. Mudslides <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> buried at least 120cars in the area.|$|E

5|$|The {{moisture}} {{extended into}} southern California and produced moderate precipitation across the region. Bakersfield reported a one-day rainfall record on September 4 with 0.23inches (5.8mm) of precipitation, breaking {{the previous record}} of 0.17inches (4.3mm) set in 1963. Rainfall amounts at Frazier Park peaked at 1.53inches (39mm). Agricultural losses, primarily from vintners and raisin growers, rose up to $5million in damage (1998USD, $6.33million 2007USD), either directly due to rain or indirectly due to the additional steps to treat the increase in fungus activity on produce. Slick roads <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> resulted in nearly 80traffic accidents in San Diego County, ranging from fender benders to moderate injuries. Thunderstorms from the remnants of Isis damaged a San Diego Gas & Electric substation at Kearny Mesa, leaving 10,000customers without power; the outage was short lived and completely restored within two hours. About 1,000homes and businesses were temporarily without power in Escondido, and another 2,700customers lost electricity in Rancho Bernardo. Rainfall in and around San Diego reached a maximum of 0.5inches (13mm) at La Mesa. Heavy clouds from Isis produced scattered rainfall and temporary relief to severe heat conditions in the Los Angeles area.|$|E
5|$|When {{the crowd}} finally reached Versailles, it {{was met by}} another group that had {{assembled}} from the surrounding area. Members of the Assembly greeted the marchers and invited Maillard into their hall, where he fulminated about the Flanders Regiment and the people's need for bread. As he spoke, the restless Parisians came pouring into the Assembly and sank exhausted on the deputies' benches. Hungry, fatigued, and bedraggled <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain,</b> they seemed {{to confirm that the}} siege was a simple demand for food. The unprotected deputies {{had no choice but to}} receive the marchers, who shouted down most of the speakers and demanded to hear from the popular reformist deputy Mirabeau. The great orator declined this chance at demagoguery but nonetheless mingled familiarly with the market women, even sitting for some time with one of them upon his knee. A few other deputies welcomed the marchers warmly, including Maximilien Robespierre who was still at that time a relatively obscure figure in politics. Robespierre gave strong words of support to the women and their plight, and his efforts were received appreciatively; his solicitations helped greatly to soften the crowd's hostility towards the Assembly.|$|E
5|$|The American cavalry {{pursued the}} {{soldiers}} that had retreated from Coamo, {{but were not}} able to reach them until the units had entered Aibonito Pass, a region more commonly known as Asomante. The region had been prepared by allied Puerto Rican and Spanish troops, who had built a trench and placed soldiers and equipment around the foliage. As soon as the soldiers noticed the presence of the invading unit they opened cannon fire. The cavalry received infantry reinforcements, which were received by battery fire. Six American soldiers were injured in the crossfire, prompting a retreat order. The allied units (Spanish and Puerto Rican) lost five soldiers and two civil guards. During the following two days the Americans decided to do a battlefield reconnaissance and Colonel S. Reber, developed a croquis of the Aibonito Pass. Spies were deployed throughout Coamo, including a Puerto Rican separatist named Carlos Patterne, who was able to enter the city without suspicion and contact Rufino Huertas, a separatist teacher. Huertas gave Patterne a series of defense plans that were previously developed and organized by Martínez Illescas. While inactive, the Puerto Rican soldiers deployed in Asomante completed rounds every two hours, working four hours daily. They mostly ate beans, some rice and meat, while conserving several cracker packs for Spanish reinforcements that were supposed to arrive. They slept in improvised huts that did not protect them <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain.</b>|$|E
