40|$|The Earth’s <b>internal</b> <b>magnetic</b> field {{controls}} {{to a degree}} the strength, geographic positioning, and structure of currents flowing in the ionosphere and magnetosphere, which produce their own (external) magnetic fields. The secular variation of the Earth’s <b>internal</b> <b>magnetic</b> field can therefore lead to long-term changes in the externally produced magnetic field as well. Here we will examine this more closely. First, we obtain scaling relations to describe how the strength of magnetic perturbations associated with various different current systems in the ionosphere and magnetosphere depends on the <b>internal</b> <b>magnetic</b> field intensity. Second, we discuss how changes in the orientation of a simple dipolar magnetic field will affect the current systems. Third, we use model simulations to study how actual changes in the Earth’s <b>internal</b> <b>magnetic</b> field between 1908 and 2008 have affected some of the relevant current systems.

For isotropic distribution functions such as those corresponding to thermal equilibrium the <b>magnetic</b> <b>screening</b> mass at one loop level is found to be zero which is consistent with finite temperature field theory. The non-zero <b>magnetic</b> <b>screening</b> mass in non-isotropic non-equlibrium situations has fundamental importance in that it acts as a natural cut-off to remove infrared divergences in the magnetic sector. Thus it allows one to avoid infrared problems which previously made it difficult to use a transport theory approach using perturbative QCD or QED scattering kernels to study the thermalization of a QED or QCD plasma.

From the long-distance {{behaviour}} of correlation functions of {{temporal and spatial}} components of the gauge fields we extract electric (me) and <b>magnetic</b> (mm) <b>screening</b> masses. For temperatures larger than twice Tc we find no additional temperature dependence in me(T) /T, while mm(T) /T drops with increasing temperature.

A multi-antenna system design based onm etamaterial separators will be designed {{in order to reduce the}} size of the multi-antenna structure keeping the isolation level between antenna elements. Firstly, a unit cell to be used in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>screen</b> will be analysed and designed. Next, a monopole will be tuned at an operating frequency of 2. 45 GHz. Secondly, two multi-antenna systems will be designed, a first having two monopoles and another one with four monopoles.

40|$|The {{determination}} of the <b>internal</b> <b>magnetic</b> field of Jupiter has been the object of many studies and publications. These models have been computed from the Pioneer, Voyager, and Ulysses measurements. Some models also use {{the position of the}} Io footprints as a constraint: the magnetic field lines mapping to the footprints must have their origins along Io’s orbit. The use of this latter constraint to determine the <b>internal</b> <b>magnetic</b> field models greatly improved the modeling of the auroral emissions, in particular the radio ones, which strongly depends on the magnetic field geometry. This constraint is, however, not sufficient for allowing a completely accurate modeling. The fact that the footprint field line should map to a longitude close to Io’s was not used, so that the azimuthal component of the magnetic field could not be precisely constrained. Moreover, a recent study showed the presence of a magnetic anomaly in the northern hemisphere, which has never been included in any spherical harmonic decomposition of the <b>internal</b> <b>magnetic</b> field. We compute a decomposition of the Jovian <b>internal</b> <b>magnetic</b> field into spherical harmonics, which allows for a more accurate mapping of the magnetic field lines crossing Io, Europa, and Ganymede orbits to the satellite footprints observed in UV.
