5|$|While the African wildcat is {{the ancestral}} {{subspecies}} from which domestic cats are descended, and wildcats and domestic cats can completely interbreed (being subspecies {{of the same}} species), several intermediate stages occur between domestic pet and pedigree cats {{on one hand and}} entirely wild animals on the other. The semiferal cat, a mostly outdoor cat, is not owned by any one individual, but is generally friendly to people and may be <b>fed</b> <b>by</b> several households. Feral cats are associated with human habitation areas and may be <b>fed</b> <b>by</b> people or forage for food, but are typically wary of human interaction.|$|E
5|$|Adult frogs {{lay their}} eggs in moist places, {{including}} on leaves, in plants, among exposed roots, and elsewhere. Once the eggs hatch, the adult piggybacks the tadpoles, one at a time, to suitable water, either a pool, or the water gathered in the throat of bromeliads or other plants. The tadpoles remain there until they metamorphose, <b>fed</b> <b>by</b> unfertilized eggs laid at regular intervals by the mother.|$|E

It was her last journey outside England.|$|E

5|$|Assigned {{emergency}} roles {{called for}} Grissom, in the left-hand seat, {{to open the}} cabin pressure vent valve, after which White in the center seat was to open the plug door hatch, while Chaffee in the right-hand seat was to maintain communications. Grissom was prevented from opening the valve by {{the intensity of the}} fire, which started in that region and spread from left to right. Despite this, White removed his restraints and apparently tried in vain to open the hatch, which was held closed by the cabin pressure. The increasing pressure finally burst the inner cabin wall on the right-hand side at 23:31:19 GMT. After approximately thirty seconds of being <b>fed</b> <b>by</b> a cabin atmosphere of pure oxygen at pressures of , and now <b>fed</b> <b>by</b> nitrogen-buffered ambient air, the primary fire decreased in intensity and started producing large amounts of smoke, which killed the astronauts. Chaffee lost consciousness when he experienced myocardial hypoxia, which sent him into cardiac arrest and resulted in cerebral hypoxia. He died from asphyxia due to the toxic gasses from the fire, with burns contributing to his death.|$|E
5|$|Both species lay 3–5 {{normally}} whitish eggs blotched {{with brown}} or grey, which are incubated by the female alone. The chicks hatch after {{two to three}} weeks. Red-billed chough chicks are almost naked, but the chicks of the higher altitude Alpine chough hatch with a dense covering of natal down. The chicks are <b>fed</b> <b>by</b> both parents and fledge in 29–31 days after hatching for Alpine chough, and 31–41days for red-billed.|$|E
5|$|Females {{lay between}} three and seven pale bluish-green, brown-blotched eggs. Incubation is about 18 to 21 days, by the female only. However, the male may stand or crouch over the young, {{sheltering}} but not actually brooding them. Young fledge at 35 to 42 days, and are <b>fed</b> <b>by</b> both parents. They stay with their parents for another six months after fledging.|$|E

5|$|Fieldfares often nest {{in small}} colonies, {{possibly}} {{for protection from}} predators. The nest is built in a tree where five or six eggs are laid. The chicks are <b>fed</b> <b>by</b> both parents and leave the nest after a fortnight. There may be two broods in southern parts of the range but only one further north. Migrating birds and wintering birds often form large flocks, often {{in the company of}} Redwings.|$|E
5|$|Longacre's obverse of {{an eagle}} in flight {{is based on}} that of the Gobrecht dollar, struck in small {{quantities}} from 1836 to 1839. Although Gobrecht's model is not known with certainty, some sources state that the bird in flight was based on Peter the eagle, a tame bird <b>fed</b> <b>by</b> Mint workers in the early 1830s until it {{was caught up in}} machinery and killed. The bird was stuffed, and is still displayed at the Philadelphia Mint.|$|E
5|$|Pettigrew State Park {{surrounds}} Lake Phelps, North Carolina's {{second largest}} natural made lake. The lake, on a peninsula between Albemarle Sound and the Pamlico River, {{is one of}} a series of Carolina bay lakes that stretch from New Jersey to Florida along the Atlantic Coastal Plain. Exactly how the lakes were formed remains a mystery. What is known is that Lake Phelps is not <b>fed</b> <b>by</b> any stream, but relies entirely upon rain and springs to maintain its water level. Since the lake is not <b>fed</b> <b>by</b> a stream that could carry pollutants from nearby farms and factories, the water is very clean. Lake Phelps is five miles (8km) across, with an average depth of just 4.5feet (1.5m). The lake is thought to be more than 38,000 years old.|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} an ardent {{interest}} in herbivore saliva due to its roles in inducing plant defenses {{and its impact on}} herbivore fitness. Two techniques are described that inhibit the secretion of labial saliva from the caterpillar, Helicoverpa zea, during feeding. The methods rely on cauterizing the caterpillar's spinneret, the principal secretory structure of the labial glands, or surgically removing the labial salivary gland. Both methods successfully inhibit secretion of saliva and the principal salivary enzyme glucose oxidase. Caterpillars with inhibited saliva production feed at similar rates as the untreated caterpillars, pupate, and emerge as adults. Glucose oxidase has been suggested to increase the caterpillar's survival through the suppression of inducible anti-herbivore defenses in plants. Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) leaves <b>fed</b> on <b>by</b> caterpillars with ablated salivary glands had significantly higher levels of nicotine, an inducible anti-herbivore defense compound of tobacco, than leaves <b>fed</b> upon <b>by</b> caterpillars with intact labial salivary glands. Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) leaves <b>fed</b> upon <b>by</b> caterpillars with suppressed salivary secretions showed greatly reduced evidence of hydrogen peroxide formation compared to leaves <b>fed</b> upon <b>by</b> intact caterpillars. These two methods are useful techniques for determining the role that saliva plays in manipulating plant anti-herbivore defenses...|$|R

Magpies will become accustomed to being <b>fed</b> <b>by</b> humans, and although they are wild, {{will return to the}} same place looking for handouts. The idea is that humans thereby appear less of a threat to the nesting birds. Although this has not been studied systematically, there are reports of its success.|$|E
