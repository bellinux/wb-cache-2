500|$|Under {{the cover}} of {{darkness}} an unidentified man jumps over the fence to the White House and is intercepted by Secret Service personnel. As he struggles with them, <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>a</b> gun and accidentally shoots himself. Bleeding on the ground, the man hands over a computer disk, begging them {{to give it to}} the president. Three words are written on the disk: [...] "FIGHT THE FUTURE".|$|E
500|$|This is {{the final}} straw for Jody. <b>He</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>a</b> gun on Ben and threatens to kill him. [...] Ben talks his way out by telling Jody about buried Civil War-era {{treasure}} he has supposedly found on a property that Will gave him, a down payment to seal their bargain over Clara. Jody starts digging and finds a bag of coins. He is elated, thinking he might finally free himself of his father's domination; he buys the land from Ben. Late that night, Will finds his son, still digging. After examining one of the coins, Will notices that it was minted in 1910. Jody is shattered.|$|E
500|$|In the video, Usher {{sits in a}} car {{outside a}} house where his ex-girlfriend is being {{intimate}} with another man. <b>He</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>a</b> gun out of his glove compartment and agonizes {{over whether or not}} to enter the house. After ruminating over the different scenarios, Usher drives off {{at the end of the}} video. Jason Lipshut of Billboard found the [...] "narrative arc" [...] for the video to be [...] "a bit perplexing". Jeff Lapointe of MTV News viewed that it [...] "depicts the darker side of human nature as Usher drives up to his girlfriend/ex-girlfriends house to discover another vehicle, another man, another side of his love. In the realization of fury and anger, images distort Usher's reality with thoughts of taking his gun and shooting the intruder. Thoughts of running away with the girl. Thoughts of driving off to never be seen." ...|$|E

2500|$|The film is {{composed}} of multiple comedy shorts presented through an overarching segment titled [...] "The Pitch", in which Charlie Wessler (Dennis Quaid), a mad screenwriter, is attempting to pitch a script to film executive Griffin Schraeder (Greg Kinnear). After revealing several of the stories in his script, Wessler becomes agitated when Schraeder dismisses his outrageous ideas, and <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>a</b> gun on him and forces him to listen to multiple other stories before making Schraeder consult his manager, Bob Mone (Common), to purchase the film. When they do so, Mone's condescending, humiliating attitude toward Schraeder angers him to the point that, after agreeing to make the film [...] "the biggest film since Howard the Duck", he confronts Mone {{in the parking lot}} with a gun and tries to make him perform fellatio on the security guard (Will Sasso) (Wessler had gotten on the lot by doing the same thing) and kill him if he does not make the film. Wessler tries to calm Schraeder down with more story ideas to no avail, but Mone pulls out a gun and shoots Schraeder to death. The segment ends with it being revealed that it is being shot by a camera crew as part of the movie, leading into the final segments.|$|E
2500|$|Madison begins her own investigation, {{beginning}} by questioning Adrian Baker, a fired {{surgeon who}} now illegally deals medical supplies as drugs. She finds her next {{lead in the}} [...] "Blue Lagoon", a night club. If the player does not have Madison leave after finding evidence leading her to the club, or has her drink Baker's secretly drugged drink, she is knocked out and wakes up tied to operating table. If the player fails to escape here, Madison will be killed and removed from the game's future chapters. If she lives, she will {{then go to the}} Blue Lagoon and interrogate Paco Mendez, the club's owner. After Paco leads her to his office to be private, <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>a</b> gun on her and forces her to strip. After stripping clothes until the player manages to surprise hit Paco with a lamp, she ties him up and begins questioning him. Next, she goes back to the motel and talks with Ethan. Madison leans in to kiss Ethan, and the player, as Ethan, may choose whether or not to embrace her, leading to a sex scene, or reject her. After the sex scene, Ethan finds her photos and the beginning of a story about him as the possible Origami Killer. As Ethan, the player may choose whether Ethan tells her to leave, ending the romance, or forgives her. Whichever the player chooses, Madison leaves, and notices the cops. The player may have her warn Ethan, {{who may or may not}} be arrested depending on the player's next actions as him.|$|E

6000|$|... "Dozens!"

60|$|From {{that day}} to this the Moon has always pulled the sea {{up and down and}} made what we call the tides.

6000|$|LIEUTENANT (contemptuously). Attacked! I {{could have}} broken his back between my finger and thumb. I wish I had, now. No: {{it was by}} {{appealing}} to the better side of my nature: that's what I can't get over. He said he'd never met a man he liked so much as me. He put his handkerchief round my neck because a gnat bit me, and my stock was chafing it. Look! (<b>He</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>a</b> handkerchief from his stock. Giuseppe takes it and examines it.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And that is Francesco--Frank--" [...] Francesco gave a faint curl of his lip, half smile, as he saluted her involuntarily in a {{military}} fashion. He was dark, rather tall and loose, with yellow-tawny eyes. He was an Italian from the south. Madame gave another look at him. [...] "He doesn't like his English name of Frank. You will see, <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>a</b> face. No, he doesn't like it. We call him Ciccio also--" [...] But Ciccio was dropping his head sheepishly, with the same faint smile on his face, half grimace, and stooping to his chair, wanting to sit down.|$|E

It's even money that if anyone's been croaked in Oakdale last night they won't have to look far for the guy that done it.

60|$|It {{was a great}} {{while after}} this that I had occasion, on my own business, to go to Bristol, upon which he hired me a coach, and would go with me, and did so; and now indeed our {{intimacy}} increased. From Bristol he carried me to Gloucester, which was merely a journey of pleasure, to take the air; and here it was our hap to have no lodging in the inn but in one large chamber with two beds in it. The master of the house going up with us to show his rooms, and coming into that room, said very frankly to him, 'Sir, it is {{none of my business}} to inquire whether the lady be your spouse or no, but if not, you may lie as honestly in these two beds as if you were in two chambers,' and with that <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>a</b> great curtain which drew quite across the room and effectually divided the beds. 'Well,' says my friend, very readily, 'these beds will do, and as for the rest, we are too near akin to lie together, though we may lodge near one another'; and this put an honest face on the thing too. When we came to go to bed, he decently went out of the room till I was in bed, and then went to bed in the bed on his own side of the room, but lay there talking to me a great while.|$|E
6000|$|I {{stuck it}} with {{elaborate}} care into my pocket, {{and with a}} whirling brain walked home through the Regent Street loiterers and the dark back streets beyond Portland Road. I remember the sensations of that walk very vividly, strange as they were. I was still so far myself that I could notice my strange mental state, and wonder whether this stuff I had had was opium--a drug beyond my experience. It is hard now to describe the peculiarity of my mental strangeness--mental doubling vaguely expresses it. As I was walking up Regent Street I found in my mind a queer persuasion that it was Waterloo Station, and had an odd impulse {{to get into the}} Polytechnic as a man might get into a train. I put a knuckle in my eye, and it was Regent Street. How can I express it? You see a skilful actor looking quietly at you, <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>a</b> grimace, and lo!--another person. Is it too extravagant if I tell you that it seemed to me as if Regent Street had, for the moment, done that? Then, being persuaded it was Regent Street again, I was oddly muddled about some fantastic reminiscences that cropped up. [...] "Thirty years ago," [...] thought I, [...] "it was here that I quarrelled with my brother." [...] Then I burst out laughing, to the astonishment and encouragement of a group of night prowlers. Thirty years ago I did not exist, and never in my life had I boasted a brother. The stuff was surely liquid folly, for the poignant regret for that lost brother still clung to me. Along Portland Road the madness took another turn. I began to recall vanished shops, and to compare the street with what it used to be. Confused, troubled thinking is comprehensible enough after the drink I had taken, but what puzzled me were these curiously vivid phantasm memories that had crept into my mind, and not only the memories that had crept in, but also the memories that had slipped out. I stopped opposite Stevens', the natural history dealer's, and cudgelled my brains to think {{what he had to do}} with me. A 'bus went by, and sounded exactly like the rumbling of a train. I seemed to be dipping into some dark, remote pit for the recollection. [...] "Of course," [...] said I, at last, [...] "he has promised me three frogs to-morrow. Odd I should have forgotten." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{term was}} used by [...] "Jimmy McGill" [...] in season 2, episode 10, of the TV show [...] "Better Call Saul", after <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> dirty trick on his brother [...] "Chuck".|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> powder flask {{from his}} pocket, and, shaking {{it at the}} ear of the savage, offered it to him, {{at the same time}} {{pointing}} to the partridges and to his own open mouth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sit down, bo," [...] invited Soup Face. [...] "I guess you're {{a regular}} all right. Here, have a snifter?" [...] and <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> flask from his side pocket, holding it toward The Oskaloosa Kid.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bless you, if I was to {{tell you}} all the thieves and burglars, and even murderers, as have been in my growler one time or another, you'd think I'd given the whole Newgate Calendar a lift, though to be sure this young chap as I spoke of {{was the only one}} as ever reg'lar set up in {{business}} there. There was one though as I reckon to be worse than all the others put together, if he was what I think him to be. It's often laid heavy on my mind that I didn't have that chap collared before it was too late, for I might have saved some mischief. It was about ten years ago--I never was a good hand for dates--that I picked up a stout-built sailor-sort of fellow, with a reddish moustache, who wanted to be taken down to the docks. After this chap as I told you of had taken such liberties with the premises I'd {{had a little bit of}} a glass slit let in in front here--the same that your little boy's flattening his nose against at this moment--so as I could prevent any such games in the future, and have an idea, whenever I wished, of what was going on inside. Well, something or another about this sailor fellow made me suspicious of him, and I took a look at what he was after. He was sitting on the seat, sir, with a big lump o' coal in his lap, and was a looking at it most attentive. Now this seemed to me rather a rum start, so I kept on watching of him, for as you'll see, my window's not a very large one, and it's easier to see through it than to be seen. Well, <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>a</b> spring or something, and out jumps one of the sides of this bit of coal, and then I saw it was really a hollow box, painted, you see, and made rough so as to look like the other. I couldn't make head or tail of it anyhow, and indeed I'd pretty near forgot all about it when there came news of the explosion at Bemerhaven, and people began to talk about coal torpedoes. Then I knew as in all probability I'd carried the man who managed the business, and I gave word to the police, but they never could make anything of it. You know what a coal torpedo is, don't you? Well, you see, a cove insures his ship for more than its value, and then off he goes and makes a box like a bit o'coal, and fills it chock full with dynamite, or some other cowardly stuff of the sort. He drops this box among the other coals on the quay when the vessel is filling her bunkers, and then in course of time box is shoveled on to the furnaces, when of course the whole ship is blown sky high. They say there's many a good ship gone to the bottom like that." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{sat down}} abruptly, {{to conceal the}} too-revealing fact that his limbs were shaking. <b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> {{handkerchief}} from his pocket to mop his brow, which had grown damp. And then, quite suddenly, he found himself weeping.|$|R
6000|$|... "Slingerland, she's {{not such}} a little girl," [...] he said, irrelevantly. Then he slipped his hands under her arms again. Suddenly he felt {{something}} wet and warm and sticky. <b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> hand out. It was blood-stained.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, come, old chap!" [...] he said soothingly, [...] "don't cut up. We'll {{make things}} a little more homelike here." [...] And <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> bottle {{from the depths of}} the hamper. [...] "This will brace you up." ...|$|R
