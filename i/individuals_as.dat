Walkthroughs may alternatively be set up as a playthrough, where players record themselves playing through a game and upload or live-stream it to the internet. Walkthroughs may be considered guides on helping to enhance the experience of players, to assist towards unlocking game achievements or simply {{as a means to}} socialise with like-minded <b>individuals</b> <b>as</b> a distraction from everyday life.|$|E
5|$|Although Sestak was {{initially}} urged to {{run by the}} Democratic establishment, Specter gained wide support from Democrats after he switched parties. Major political figures like President Barack Obama and Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell later tried to sway Sestak from continuing the race, fearing he would damage Specter's chances in the general election. Former President Bill Clinton offered Sestak {{a position in the}} Obama administration if he withdrew his candidacy, an offer Republicans would later criticize. Sestak refused to drop out and criticized Specter's party switch as an opportunistic move aimed solely at self-preservation. Nevertheless, Sestak struggled to overcome problems stemming from low name recognition and Specter's support from such <b>individuals</b> <b>as</b> Joe Biden and Harry Reid, and organizations like the AFL-CIO and Pennsylvania Democratic Committee.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} bat's {{discovery}} in the 1970s, some roosting sites became disturbed {{as a result}} of tourism, scientific collection, and even the collection and sale of <b>individuals</b> <b>as</b> souvenirs. However, these pressures may not have had a significant effect on the species as a whole, since many small colonies exist in hard-to-access locations, and only a few major caves were disturbed. Another potential risk is the activity of local monks, who have occupied roost caves during periods of meditation.|$|E
5|$|The {{first stage}} of the test {{considers}} whether the law prescribes different treatment for one group of <b>individuals</b> <b>as</b> against other groups. For example, in the 1998 High Court decision Taw Cheng Kong v. Public Prosecutor, Judge of Appeal M.

5|$|The {{proportional}} representation {{system for the}} House of Councillors, introduced in 1982, {{was the first major}} electoral reform under the post-war constitution. Instead of choosing national constituency candidates as <b>individuals,</b> <b>as</b> had previously been the case, voters cast ballots for parties. Individual councillors, listed officially by the parties before the election, are {{selected on the basis of}} the parties' proportions of the total national constituency vote. The system was introduced to reduce the excessive money spent by candidates for the national constituencies. Critics charged, however, that this new system benefited the two largest parties, the LDP and the Japan Socialist Party (now Social Democratic Party), which in fact had sponsored the reform.|$|E

5|$|There is {{no record}} of Molotov {{attempting}} to moderate {{the course of the}} purges or even to save <b>individuals,</b> <b>as</b> some other Soviet officials did. During the Great Purge, he approved 372 documented execution lists, more than any other Soviet official, including Stalin. Molotov was one of few with whom Stalin openly discussed the purges. Although Molotov and Stalin signed a public decree in 1938 that disassociated them from the ongoing Great Purge, in private, and even after Stalin's death, Molotov supported the Great Purge and the executions carried out by his government.|$|E
5|$|At Parc Cwm long cairn {{a variety}} of {{mortuary}} practices was evident and the deliberate ordering of skeletal parts noticeable. Whittle and Wysocki (1998) note cremated human remains were placed only in the front, right (southeast) chamber, where females and males, and all age ranges were represented. The southeast chamber was also unusual in that it contained nearly {{three times as many}} <b>individuals</b> <b>as</b> in each of the other chambers, which contained the remains of all representative groups except younger children and infants. At the forecourt entrance Atkinson recorded finds, deposited in groups, including: flint debitage, lithic cores and a bladelet (burnt and unburnt); a leaf-shaped arrowhead (burnt); pieces of quartz; pieces of stalactite (now missing); sherds of Neolithic pottery; and cremated bone fragments. Atkinson speculated that the stalactite originated from Cat Hole cave, which (along with Tooth Hole cave) Whittle and Wysocki note as a possible source of the quartz too.|$|E

5|$|From a {{husbandry}} {{point of}} view, hyenas are easily kept, {{as they have}} few disease problems {{and it is not}} uncommon for captive hyenas to reach 15–20 years of age. Nevertheless, the spotted hyena was historically scantily represented in zoos, and was typically obtained in order to fill empty cages until a more prestigious species could be obtained. In subsequent years, animals considered to be more charismatic were allocated larger and better quality facilities, while hyenas were often relegated to inferior exhibits. In modern times, the species faces spatial competition from more popular animals, especially large canids. Also, many captive individuals have not been closely examined to confirm their sexes, thus resulting in non-breeding pairs often turning out to be same-sexed <b>individuals.</b> <b>As</b> a result, many captive hyena populations are facing extinction.|$|E
