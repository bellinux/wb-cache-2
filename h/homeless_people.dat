40|$|Perspectives and {{experiences}} of <b>homeless</b> young <b>people</b> Aim. This paper reports a study describing the experiences and perspectives of <b>homeless</b> young <b>people</b> as research participants. Background. Worldwide, <b>homeless</b> young <b>people</b> are an especially vulnerable group due to their age, socio-economic disadvantage, and stigmatized status, and can suffer from human rights abuses. Researchers and advocates have noted that we know relatively little {{about the effects of}} research participation on adolescents in general, and much less about marginalized adolescents such as homeless young people; nor do we know about their perceptions {{and experiences}} as research participants. There is a lack of studies reported to help guide the ethical conduct of research with <b>homeless</b> young <b>people.</b> Methods. Individual interviews with 30 street and clinic-based <b>homeless</b> young <b>people</b> aged 15 – 23 years and two focus groups with a total of 13 additional <b>homeless</b> young <b>people</b> were conducted in a large West-coast city in the United States of America.

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the ways in which}} <b>homeless</b> young <b>people</b> find a sense of self-worth and dignity within the conditions of youth homelessness. It notes that, while <b>homeless</b> young <b>people</b> seek a space where they do not feel marginalised and can attain a form of social status and cultural competence, they also engage in practices and acts of defiant independence that appear counter-productive and self-destructive. The author, utilising ethnographic research with <b>homeless</b> young <b>people,</b> including interviews, focus groups and participant observation over a 12 -month period, finds that conventional concepts of cultural capital cannot explain this contradictory behaviour. He posits instead the concept of negative cultural capital as a way of explaining why <b>homeless</b> young <b>people</b> struggle for recognition in ways that collude in reinforcing their marginalisation...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Although {{music is}} {{considered}} to be an important part of adolescence and young adulthood, little is known about music and homeless youth. Accordingly, this dissertation research investigated the role of music in the lives of <b>homeless</b> young <b>people,</b> aged 15 - 25. The study was conducted in Seattle, Washington and Vancouver, British Columbia and engaged <b>homeless</b> young <b>people</b> (n= 202) and service providers staff who work at agencies that provide support for <b>homeless</b> young <b>people</b> (n= 24). <b>Homeless</b> young <b>people</b> completed surveys (n= 202), design activities, which included drawing and story writing (n= 149), and semi-structured interviews (n= 40). Service providers completed semi-structured interviews (n= 24). Data analysis included descriptive analysis of survey data and qualitative coding of the design activities and interview responses. Findings indicated that music was an important part of everyday life for <b>homeless</b> young <b>people,</b> who listened to music daily (98 %), owned music players (89 %), and had wide-ranging and eclectic tastes in music which did not vary based on location. Music played a role in emotional control and regulation, in relationships with other <b>people,</b> and <b>homeless</b> young <b>people</b> engaged with music not only through listening, but also by singing, dancing and playing musical instruments. Additionally, the study shows that public libraries and service agencies are key places for <b>homeless</b> young <b>people</b> to access the Internet in order to listen to music, despite evidence that 22 % of participants (45 / 202) had been banned {{at one time or another}} from either libraries or service agencies. Findings also indicated that risk-taking behaviors were high among the <b>homeless</b> young <b>people</b> but did not show that music led to particular behaviors. Finally, analysis of the drawings and stories from the design activities indicated that <b>homeless</b> young <b>people</b> could imagine how music devices could help homeless youth in practical ways as well as play a role in service provision for homeless youth and in building relationships with the mainstream community...|$|R

5|$|On 2 June, and in {{response}} to a question from Fianna Fáil's James Browne about government spending on mental health, McEntee told the Dáil the government was committed to an annual increase in funding; Browne had noted that in 2014, €20 million had been allocated to mental health services rather than the promised €35 million, but McEntee said that €35 million had been ringfenced for 2016 and 2017. Along with Minister for Health Simon Harris, McEntee argued for the restoration of €12 million originally ringfenced for mental health spending that had been diverted to other areas. On 8 June, and as part of a €480m bailout package for health, the government announced that the mental health funding would be restored. Welcoming the decision, McEntee said the money would be used for staff recruitment and to improve services for <b>homeless</b> <b>people,</b> as well as developing perinatal mental health services.|$|E
40|$|Objective: The study {{explored}} <b>homeless</b> young <b>people</b> 2 ̆ 7 s {{knowledge and}} attitudes of Chlamydia trachomatis (Chlamydia) and its screening. Design: Semi-structured interviews using focus groups. Setting: An inner city clinic for <b>homeless</b> young <b>people.</b> Subjects: <b>Homeless</b> young <b>people</b> aged 16 - 26 years. Outcomes: Perceptions of Chlamydia and its screening. Results: 19 males and 6 females aged 16 - 26 years participated. Content analysis confirmed a lack of knowledge, prior education and misinformation about Chlamydia and barriers to being screened. Ideas for informing young people about Chlamydia included advertising on billboards, in free newspapers, and improved school sex education programs. Conclusions: <b>Homeless</b> young <b>people</b> have poor knowledge of Chlamydia and its screening and barriers to the screening process.

40|$|Abstract: The {{theory of}} planned {{behaviour}} (TPB) and self-categorization theory (SCT) {{were used to}} predict <b>homeless</b> <b>people's</b> (n = 80) uptake of housing support services. <b>Homeless</b> <b>people's</b> uptake behaviour was measured one year after a TPB/SCT-based interview schedule was administered. Congruent with previous research, TPB variables were influential predictors of both intention and behaviour. However, the addition of self-categorization variables, such as friendship group norms and identification as a housing support service user, significantly increased the rate prediction for both intention and behaviour, respectively. The implications of the research are firstly, that social cognition models are useful for understanding uptake of housing support services; and secondly, the addition of self-categorization variables aids in exploring the central role that social norms play in understanding the uptake of these services. These findings are {{discussed in terms of}} their impact on theory and practice...|$|R

5|$|At one point, Nathan {{asks for}} Jodie's {{help with the}} condenser, which has broken open. After braving hostile {{entities}} from the Infraworld, Jodie manages {{to shut down the}} condenser and warns Nathan not to build another. This gets the attention of the CIA, who send agent Ryan Clayton (Eric Winter) to forcibly recruit Jodie. After training, the now-adult Jodie goes on multiple missions as a field agent, often with Ryan, to whom she slowly becomes attracted. On one such mission in Somalia, Jodie learns that the target she killed was not a warlord, but the country's benign president. An enraged Jodie flees in disgust, despite Ryan's pleas. Branded a traitor, Jodie becomes a fugitive, evading pursuing CIA forces. Along the way, she befriends a group of <b>homeless</b> <b>people,</b> one of whom she helps give birth, and a family of Native Americans whom she saves from a malevolent entity. The CIA eventually recaptures Jodie after she attempts to reconnect with her catatonic biological mother, who has been held and forcibly drugged for decades in a military hospital.|$|E

While wandering the streets, he visits a breadline that is serving Thanksgiving dinner for <b>homeless</b> <b>people.</b> A television crew led by Kent Brockman is covering the event, and they interview Bart. The family sees the report on television and calls the police, hoping that they can find Bart and return him. When the police fail, Homer and Marge start to regret the bad things they said to Bart, who eventually returns home feeling remorseful. However, his dilemma is worsened when he imagines his family blaming him for everything if he apologized for ruining Thanksgiving. Back to the present, he realizes that it was all his own imagination. He climbs up onto the roof of the house to think things out. Hearing Lisa cry because she misses him, Bart calls for her to come onto the roof. He then realizes that what he did was wrong and apologizes to her. Bart later rejoins the family to enjoy a meal of Thanksgiving leftovers.|$|E
40|$|This article {{proposes that}} the social lives of <b>homeless</b> young <b>people</b> are {{structured}} by two strategies: autonomy and relatedness. The strategy of autonomy is the prevailing modus operandi of <b>homeless</b> young <b>people</b> who respond to the uncertainty and instability of their lives with a defiant independence and self-reliance. However, their propensity to self-interested autonomy exacerbates a sense of isolation, alienation and loneliness, {{which leads to the}} strategy of relatedness. These strategies are responses to instability that take divergent, and even contradictory, approaches to dealing with the conditions of youth homelessness. There is a complex interaction between these two strategies, with <b>homeless</b> young <b>people</b> 2 ̆ 7 s social lives and the conditions of their lives structured by the seeming incompatibility of autonomy and relatedness. This article draws on ethnographic research and 12 months of participant observation to provide an understanding of the strategies of autonomy and relatedness as they pertain to the lives to <b>homeless</b> young <b>people.</b> The strategies of autonomy and relatedness capture the recurring themes and organising sentiments in the lives of <b>homeless</b> young <b>people</b> whilst still acknowledging the diverse, inventive and unlimited variety of practices enacted by this heterogeneous group of people...|$|R
