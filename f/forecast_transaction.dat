5000|$|The International Accounting Standards IAS 32 and 39 help to give further {{direction}} for the proper accounting of derivative financial instruments. IAS 32 defines a “financial instrument” as “any contract that {{gives rise to a}} financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity”. Therefore, a forward contract or option would create a financial asset for one entity and a financial liability for another. The entity required to pay the contract holds a liability, while the entity receiving the contract payment holds an asset. These would be recorded under the appropriate headings on the balance sheet of the respective companies. IAS 39 gives further instruction, stating that the financial derivatives be recorded at fair value on the balance sheet.IAS 39 defines two major types of hedges. The first is a cash flow hedge, defined as: “a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that (i) is attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable <b>forecast</b> <b>transaction,</b> and (ii) could affect profit or loss”. In other words, a cash flow hedge is designed to eliminate the risk associated with cash transactions that can affect the amounts recorded in net income.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} effect of {{disclosure}} on risk management policies. Following recent theory on risk management, with market imperfections, risk management creates value by reducing the volatility of the cash flows. Those risk policies are conditioned by actual disclosure rules that reduce information asymmetry between managers and shareholders, providing a comprehensive view of the firm. However, disclosure gives different accounting choices, hence affecting the decision-making process of managers. The purpose of this thesis is to establish if managers adapt their actual risk policy to disclosure rules.  Specifically, we discuss how managers make decisions regarding exchange rate risk in <b>forecasted</b> <b>transactions.</b> In addition, we discuss how hedging affects valuation by using an investor perspective. This is done through {{the analysis of the}} automotive industry in Sweden, Germany and France and the considerations of analysts and auditors. We found that risk management policies are affected by accounting rules and that analysts are aware of those effects but have problems to measure them. However, not enough evidence was found to prove that managers try to avoid the volatility the fair value option brings when hedging a forecasted flow.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine {{internet}} search query data provided by “Google Trends”, with respect to its ability to serve as a sentiment indicator and improve commercial real estate <b>forecasting</b> models for <b>transactions</b> and price indices. Design/methodology/approach – This paper examines internet search query data provided by “Google Trends”, with respect to its ability to serve as a sentiment indicator and improve commercial real estate <b>forecasting</b> models for <b>transactions</b> and price indices. Findings – The empirical results show that all models augmented with Google data, combining both macro and search data, significantly outperform baseline models which abandon internet search data. Models based on Google data alone, outperform the baseline models in all cases. The models achieve a reduction over the baseline models of the mean squared <b>forecasting</b> error for <b>transactions</b> and prices of up to 35 and 54 per cent, respectively. Practical implications – The results suggest that Google data can serve as an early market indicator. The findings of this study suggest that the inclusion of Google search data in forecasting models can improve forecast accuracy significantly. This implies that commercial real estate forecasters should consider incorporating this free and timely data set into their market forecasts or when performing plausibility checks for future investment decisions.

In this paper, a novel fuzzy document-based information retrieval scheme (FDIRS) is proposed {{for the purpose of}} Stock Market Index forecasting. The novelty of the proposed approach is the use of a modified tf-idf scoring scheme to predict the future trend of the stock market index. The contribution of this paper has two dimensions: (1) In the proposed system, the simple daily time series data are converted to an enriched fuzzy linguistic time series with a unique approach of incorporating information about {{the manner in which the}} OHLC (open, high, low, and close) price formation took place at every instance of the time series, and (2) A unique approach is followed while modeling the information retrieval (IR) system which converts a simple IR system into a forecasting system.

From the performance comparison of FDIRS with standard benchmark models, it can be affirmed that the proposed model has a potential of becoming a good <b>forecasting</b> model. <b>Transaction</b> data of CNX NIFTY- 50 index of National Stock Exchange of India are used to experiment and validate the proposed model.|$|R

The focus is to improve the understanding of how balancing forecast errors from weather-dependent renewable energy sources influences the outcomes of continuous intraday markets.

In a first step, the thesis proposes a (non-mathematical) model of a continuous intraday market to show how the direction of the <b>forecast</b> error determines <b>transactions</b> between market participants, how these transactions relate to the formation of prices, and how the market integration of renewables can be improved. In a second step, the thesis provides a foundation for quantitative market analyses by modelling price-setting decisions for power generators and electricity demanders.

40|$|Web {{sites and}} {{transactional}} databases collect {{large amounts of}} time-stamped data. Businesses often want to make future predictions (forecasts) based on numerous sets of time-stamped data (sets of transactions). There are many time series analysis techniques related to forecasting, and an experienced analyst can effectively use these techniques to analyze, model, and forecast time series data. However, the number of time series to forecast may be enormous or the forecasts {{may need to be}} updated frequently, making human interaction impractical. Additionally, these time series analysis techniques require that the data be recorded on fixed time intervals. This paper proposes the following technique for automatically <b>forecasting</b> sets of <b>transactions.</b> For each set of transactions recorded in the database: The time-stamped data are accumulated to form a time series. The time series is diagnosed to choose an appropriate set of candidate forecasting models. Each of the diagnosed candidate models are fitted (trained) to the time series data with the most recent data excluded (holdout sample or test data). Based on a model selection criterion, the best performing candidate model within the holdout sample is selected to forecast the time series. This automatic forecasting technique can efficiently generate millions of forecasts related to time-stamped data.

40|$|The spatial price {{equilibrium}} {{model is}} widely used to analyze interregional trade patterns. Many large-scale applications involve the solution of linear programming subproblems to define the regional supply and demand functions. However, {{the use of such}} LP 2 ̆ 7 s gives rise to discontinuous supply and demand functions. This dissertation develops new concepts, theory and solution methods for spatial price equilibrium when such discontinuous functions are present. ^ We first estended the traditional concept of spatial price equilibrium to a more general concept to allow discontinuous market functions which we call the generalized spatial price equilibrium. We then developed an existence theory for such generalized spatial price equilibrium. ^ Furthermore, we developed a formulation technique. Using it, a spatial price equilibrium problem with step supply or/and step demand functions can be transformed into a nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP). This formulation technique saves the trouble of developing new algorithms for the solution of generalized spatial price equilibrium problems with step market functions, since any existing algorithm for the nonlinear complementarity problems can be employed. ^ Finally, we studied the electric power industry which is undergoing deregulation. We demonstrated how the generalized spatial price equilibrium model {{can be used as a}} tool to <b>forecast</b> bulk power <b>transactions</b> and prices to assist in searching for the best investment decision such as where and when to carry out a capacity expansion or retirement on either generation or transmission networks. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{forecasting}} of expressway {{traffic demand}} for existing facilities {{is not particularly}} challenging for regions and countries with stable or moderately growing economies. In most cases {{the objective is to}} carefully establish a reliable estimate for the average annual growth for the next N years using demographic and macroeconomic inputs. Recent applications for freeways and rural highways in Hawaii indicate that the traditional methods using time series or tracking important trends, such as tourism in Hawaii, work well for horizons between 5 and 20 years. Models relying on growth do not adapt well to substantial decreases in traffic demand. A dramatic case is Greece, where a multitude of changes such as increased fuel taxes, reduced GDP, increased unemployment, increased car registration (or car ownership) taxes, and a collapsed new car market caused substantial reductions of traffic on all toll roads in the country, including the Attica Tollway in the capital city of Athens. Given several series of high quality monthly data from January 2005 to December 2012, a number of estimates and forecasts for Attica Tollway toll transactions were estimated. Toll transactions are a measure similar to average daily traffic. ADT represents a traffic load at a specific location whereas toll transactions are the total daily vehicle entries to the facility. Then the 2013 to mid- 2015 actual data were used to evaluate the models. Autoregressive models were employed to arrive at toll <b>transaction</b> <b>forecasts</b> between 2013 and 2024. The models used International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) forecasts of the GDP for Greece, as well as scenarios for future fuel prices. The impacts of the much increased fuel prices and of the economic and business downturns to traffic are obvious and the models capture them successfully. However, errors in the GDP forecasts cause errors in the predicted traffic. The stock market index appears to be a useful leading indicator with a two year lag...|$|R
40|$|Valuing {{medical device}} {{companies}} {{and technologies is}} a complex process. Several different approaches and models are often used in combination to determine a transaction valuation. This research uses the Enterprise Value to Forward Sales model {{as a tool for}} valuing mergers and acquisitions in the device industry. This model was selected for its transportability across industry segments, ease of calculation, broad acceptance, and lack of detailed forecasting assumptions. This research seeks to: 1) explore the importance of 20 commonly cited factors in determining a medical device company EV/Sales multiple, 2) develop a model for forecasting the EV/Sales multiple of medical device transactions, and 3) assess the explanatory power of these factors in determining the enterprise value (measured in dollars) of pre-revenue transactions. For purposes of this analysis valuation was approached from a sector neutral or portfolio diversification perspective. Multivariate regression analysis was performed on a database of 352 M&A transactions announced between January 1, 1996 and December 31, 2007 to assess the importance of various factors and develop a model for forecasting EV/Sales multiples. Consistent with our expectations, supernormal growth, industry growth, market size, sector beta, position in market, venture funding, and IPO status were all significant factors in determining the multiple. Based on these factors, we developed a model that was 95 % accurate in forecasting the EV/Sales multiple of medical device transactions that occurred between January and May of 2008. (cont.) Based on the success of this model, we then explored the utility of these factors in determining the gross enterprise value of pre-revenue M&A transactions. As expected, this approach was not successful. Varying discount rates, timing assumptions, difficult to determine value synergies, and emotion are confounding factors which make it difficult to reliably <b>forecast</b> absolute dollar <b>transaction</b> valuations. by Jason S.
