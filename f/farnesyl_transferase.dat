Nevertheless, the importance for <b>farnesyl</b> protein <b>transferase</b> enzymatic activity for cellular physiology of untransformed cells remains poorly investigated. Materials and Methods: Peripheral blood monocytes, isolated from the blood of eight healthy volunteers, were treated with a <b>farnesyl</b> protein <b>transferase</b> inhibitor (FTI 744, 832) or vehicle control for 16 hr. Subsequently cells were challenged with different concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), colony stimulating factor- 1 (CSF- 1), or phorbol esters for 10 min, after which the activation state of p 42 /p 44 MAP kinase, p 38 MAP kinase, and Jun-N-terminal kinase was investigated using Western blotting and phosphospecific antibodies. Results: We observed that <b>farnesyl</b> protein <b>transferase</b> inhibition abrogated activation of p 38 MAP kinase by LPS, CSF- 1, and phorbol esters. Also the activation of Jun-N-terminal kinase by LPS was not seen after <b>farnesyl</b> protein <b>transferase</b> inhibition. Finally, stimulation of p 42 /p 44 MAP kinase with CSF- 1 was strongly reduced by <b>farnesyl</b> protein <b>transferase</b> inhibition, whereas activation of p 42 /p 44 MAP kinase by phorbol ester was only slightly effected. Conclusions: <b>Farnesyl</b> protein <b>transferase</b> enzymatic activity is required for proper activation of all major members of the MAP kinase family. The observation that activation the p 38 MAP kinase and Jun-N-terminal kinase is sensitive to <b>farnesyl</b> protein <b>transferase</b> inhibition raises the possibility that, in addition to cancerous disease, <b>farnesyl</b> protein <b>transferase</b> inhibitors may be useful compounds in combating inflammatory diseas...|$|R
40|$|Statins are {{compounds}} {{prescribed to}} lower blood cholesterol {{in millions of}} patients worldwide. They act by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the mevalonate pathway {{that leads to the}} synthesis of farnesyl pyrophosphate, a precursor for cholesterol synthesis and the source of lipid moieties for protein prenylation. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans possesses a mevalonate pathway that lacks the branch leading to cholesterol synthesis, and thus represents an ideal organism to specifically study the noncholesterol roles of the pathway. Inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase in C. elegans using statins or RNAi leads to developmental arrest and loss of membrane association of a GFP-based prenylation reporter. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is also strongly activated, suggesting that impaired prenylation of small GTPases leads to the accumulation of unfolded proteins and ER stress. UPR induction was also observed upon pharmacological inhibition of <b>farnesyl</b> <b>transferases</b> or RNAi inhibition of a specific isoprenoid transferase (M 57. 2) and found to be dependent on both ire- 1 and xbp- 1 but not on pek- 1 or atf- 6, which are all known regulators of the UPR. The lipid stores and fatty acid composition were unaffected in statin-treated worms, even though they showed reduced staining with Nile red. We conclude that inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase or of <b>farnesyl</b> <b>transferases</b> induce the UPR by inhibiting the prenylation of M 57. 2 substrates, resulting in developmental arrest in C. elegans.
