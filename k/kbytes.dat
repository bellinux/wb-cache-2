5|$|Each {{background}} processor {{consisted of}} a computation section, a control section and local memory. The computation section performed 64-bit scalar, floating point and vector arithmetic. The control section provided instruction buffers, memory management functions, and a real-time clock. 16 kwords (128 <b>kbytes)</b> of high-speed local memory was incorporated into each background processor for use as temporary scratch memory.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1975 at the Hannover Fair, Olivetti {{presented}} the P6060, the world's first complete, pre-assembled personal computer system. The {{central processing unit}} consisted of two cards, code named PUCE1 and PUCE2, and unlike most other personal computers was built with TTL components rather than a microprocessor. It had one or two 8" [...] floppy disk drives, a 32-character plasma display, 80-column graphical thermal printer, 48 <b>Kbytes</b> of RAM, and BASIC language. It weighed [...] As a complete system, this was a significant step from the Altair, though it never achieved the same success. It was in competition with a similar product by IBM that had an external floppy disk drive.|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} {{modified}} versions of ZMODEM appeared. ZedZap was {{a variant of}} ZMODEM with 8 <b>kbyte</b> blocks for better performance on high-speed modems. LeechZmodem was a mischievous ZMODEM variant (among similar XMODEM and YMODEM derivatives) that cheated BBS download quotas. A backwards compatible extension of ZMODEM with 32 <b>kbyte</b> and 64 <b>kbyte</b> block lengths was created by ADONTEC in 2002 and 2007 to increase performance on high-speed error free connections like ISDN or TCP/IP networks.|$|R

30|$|Performance {{analysis}} {{related to}} TCP {{is crucial for}} migration decision making and design, as MPTCP is built upon TCP. The throughput for VM 3 migration fluctuates during the migration process, as the migration is performed over the TCP protocol and the TCP auto tuning was turned on. Further, TCP performance is also {{closely related to the}} receiver window size (RWS). The TCP stack on VM 1 and VM 2 was configured with minimum of 4 <b>KByte,</b> maximum of 5394 <b>KByte,</b> and 85 <b>KByte</b> default RWS. The efficiency of TCP is KAI determined by the BW delay product (BDP). If the BDP is greater than the RWS, TCP data transmission is not efficient. To identify the scenarios which do not use the available BW efficiently, the average RWS has to be known.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} Bytesaver, {{introduced in}} 1976, {{was called the}} 8K Bytesaver since it could store up to 8K bytes of information using eight 2708 EPROMS. One limitation of early S-100 bus microcomputer systems was the 64 Kbyte address space. Cromemco introduced the concept of bank-switching to the S-100 bus which allowed memory to be place in one of 8 banks of 64 <b>Kbytes,</b> thus expanding the effective address space to 512 <b>Kbytes.</b> The Bytesaver II succeeded the 8K Bytesaver in 1978, and supported memory bank switching.|$|E
