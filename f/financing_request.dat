Group business organizations, forums, and study tours to establish networks are frequently used tools. The National Rural Livelihoods Project in India provides a good example of horizontal linkages that enable the many to achieve more than any individual could. Specifically, the project encourages the formation of savings groups that seek to overcome banks’ reluctance to work with small entrepreneurial activities by combining assets; members submit a joint <b>financing</b> <b>request</b> and repayment plan to banks. Through these linkages, more rural businesses are able to access finance. Not surprisingly, a higher percentage of programs targeting potential entrepreneurs provide networking services (62 percent) than those targeting existing entrepreneurs (48 percent).|$|E

40|$|Based on {{a survey}} of 97 firms in the garments, textiles, automotive, {{electrical}} and electronics, and food manufacturing industries; the paper highlights the difficulties faced by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in accessing finance. For both firms with access to finance {{as well as those}} that did not make any <b>finance</b> <b>request,</b> <b>financing</b> obstacles posed {{as one of the top}} four serious problems for the growth of their businesses. The survey indicates the continued dependence of SMEs on internal sources of financing not only during the start-up phase but also to finance the current operations of the business. Close to 41 percent of the respondents intend to expand the size and scope of their business in the next two years. Sixty-seven percent said that financing the expansion through internal funds alone is not sufficient with the same proportion of firms indicating that they would finance their expansion by making a loan request. Previous surveys also showed a substantial proportion of firms that planned to borrow in the future. However, the continuing dependence of firms on internal sources of financing seem to suggest a gap between the plans of firms to borrow and the actual amount of funding made available by banks. SMEs particularly the smaller ones have been unable to access funds due to their limited track record, limited acceptable collateral, and inadequate financial statements and business plans. The bank survey showed that the top reasons for turning down financial requests were the firms' poor credit history, insufficient collateral, and insufficient sales, income or cash flow, unstable business type, and poor business plan. To improve MSMEs access to finance, the paper suggests the implementation of the Central Credit Information Corporation in order to address informational asymmetries. Changing the mindsets of banks and introducing nontraditional approach to SME lending would also be important along with trainings and capacity-building programs for SMEs to improve their financial literacy and management capacity...|$|R

ABSTRACT: This study sought to investigate {{the factors that influence}} access to debt finance by Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) in Chwele Town, Bungoma County. The categories of firms under study were all registered MSEs in operation at the time. The study examined the following objectives: to determine the effect of Collateral security on access to debt finance, to establish effect of financial information on access to debt finance and to determine the effect of managerial competence on access to debt finance. The study employed a descriptive research design. The target population was 256 MSEs from which a sample size of 120 MSEs was selected using Nassiuma (2000) formula. Data was collected using self-administered questionnaires. The raw data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and regression. The first study objective sought to establish the relationship between the Collateral security and access to debt finance by MSEs in Chwele Township. It was established that most of the respondents had not pledged Collateral security for finance while. Most of the indicated that the nature of the Collateral security offered was private property which included their land. The study further established that respondents who could not provide Collateral security had their <b>finance</b> <b>requests</b> declined.
