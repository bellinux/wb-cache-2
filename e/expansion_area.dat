The rural areas {{away from the city}} tend to be scarcely populated, becoming denser near it. During the summer the resident population in the city triples; this seasonal movement from neighbouring cities is due to the draw of the beach and 29.9% of homes had seasonal use in 2001, the highest in Greater Porto. Póvoa de Varzim is the youngest city in the region with a birth rate of 13.665 and mortality rate of 8.330. Unlike other urban areas of greater Porto, it is not a satellite city. Significant commuting occurs only with Vila do Conde, an urban <b>expansion</b> <b>area</b> of Póvoa since the 18th century.|$|E

25|$|Dunfermline is the {{principal}} shopping centre serving the western area of Fife and is the region's second largest town centre by floorspace. Retailing accounts for 18% {{of the total number}} of jobs in the town. A BID (Business Improvement District) scheme for the city centre has been in operation since 2009. The majority of shops and retail services in Dunfermline are concentrated in the town centre along a high street. The Kingsgate Shopping Centre is located on the pedestrianised section of the High Street giving Dunfermline a mix of modern and traditional shops. A major extension of the Kingsgate Shopping Centre was completed in 2008 improving and expanding the retail offer in the town by attracting a major department store brand and range of other smaller retailers. Other retail areas in Dunfermline exist at Carnegie Drive Retail Park to the north of the town centre and Halbeath Retail Park to the east of the town. A large neighbourhood centre with one of the towns major supermarkets was also built as part of the eastern <b>expansion</b> <b>area</b> of Dunfermline. The Fife Leisure Park, constructed in 1999 is adjacent to the M90 at Halbeath on the eastern outskirks of Dunfermline. The leisure park has a large cinema, a health club, bowling alley and a number of restaurants.|$|E

[...] In 1969, a Federal Organized Crime Task Force accused the casino's financial manager, Jerome Zarowitz, of having ties with organized-crime figures in New York and New England. Although Zarowitz was never tried, the task force pressured Sarno and his other investors to sell the casino, which led to it being acquired by Lum's restaurant chain owners Stuart and Clifford S. Perlman for $60 million. The company soon shed its restaurant operations and changed its name to Caesars World.

The engendered problems are relative to goods and persons safety. Their considerations require a predictive management involving storage and draw-off strategy with several flood areas in order to limit water heights to the downstream of streams. A good flood management requires a control not only of storage to avoid downstream problems but also of water release to protect the fertility of flood <b>expansion</b> <b>areas</b> which are most often based on growing areas. In the literature, numerous described works were done on flows modeling and management.
