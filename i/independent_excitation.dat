40|$|A new {{probabilistic}} model identification methodology is proposed using measured response time histories only. The proposed approach {{requires that the}} number of independent measurements is larger than the number of <b>independent</b> <b>excitations.</b> Under this condition, no input measurements or any information regarding the stochastic model of the input is required. Specifically, the method does not require the response to be stationary and does not assume any knowledge of the parametric form of the spectral density of the input. Therefore, the method has very wide applicability. The proposed approach allows one to obtain not only the most probable values of the updated model parameters but also their associated uncertainties using only one set of response data. It is found that the updated probability distribution can be well approximated by a Gaussian distribution centered at the most probable values of the parameters. Examples are presented to illustrate the proposed method. Copyright (C) 2004, John Wiley Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|The optical {{modulation}} {{of neurons}} with channelrhodopsins, {{a class of}} genetically encoded light-gated ion channels, has enabled the spatiotemporally precise interrogation of the roles individual cell types play in neural circuit dynamics. A topic {{of great interest to}} the neuroscience community is the <b>independent</b> optical <b>excitation</b> of two distinct neuron populations with different wavelengths, which would enable the interrogation of emergent phenomena such as circuit dynamics, plasticity, and neuromodulation. Previous implementations have focused on maximizing spectral separation by driving one channelrhodopsin in the violet (405 nm) and the other in the yellow (590 nm), yet it has not been possible to achieve <b>independent</b> violet <b>excitation</b> without eliciting spikes from both populations, due to the intrinsic UV-blue light sensitivity of the retinal chromophore. This thesis designs and implements an improved two-color excitation scheme where effective light sensitivity is utilized to achieve <b>independent</b> optical <b>excitation</b> in blue (470 nm) and red (625 nm) channels. Zero post-synaptic crosstalk is demonstrated in acute murine slice, using two novel channeirhodopsins identified from a systematic screen of 80 naturally occurring, previously uncharacterized opsins in primary neuron culture. Gene 88 is the first known yellow-peaked channelrhodopsin, with a peak 45 nm more red-shifted than any previous channelrhodopsin, while Gene 90 has the fastest channel turn on, turn off, and recovery kinetics of any known channelrhodopsin. These opsins' novel properties enable the first known demonstration of post-synaptic crosstalk-free two-color excitation with temporally precise modulation of spatially inseparable neuron populations. by Nathan Cao Klapoetke.

40|$|Constructive {{effects of}} noise {{have been well}} studied in {{spatially}} extended systems. In most of these studies, the media are static, reaction-diffusion type, and the constructive effects are {{a consequence of the}} interplay between local excitation due to noise perturbation and propagation of excitation due to diffusion. Many chemical or biological processes occur in a fluid environment with mixing. In this paper, we investigate the interplay among noise, excitability, diffusion and mixing in excitable media advected by a chaotic flow, in a 2 D Fitz Hugh-Nagumo model described by a set of reaction-advection- diffusion equations. Without stirring, noise can only generate non-coherent excited patches of the static media. In the presence of stirring, we observe three dynamical and pattern formation regimes: i.) Non-coherent excitation, when mixing is not strong enough to achieve synchronization of <b>independent</b> <b>excitations</b> developed at different locations; ii.) Coherent global excitation, when the noise-induced perturbation propagates by mixing and generates a synchronized excitation of the whole domain; and iii.) Homogenization, when strong stirring dilutes quickly those noise-induced local excitations. In the presence of an external sub-threshold periodic forcing, the period of the noise-sustained oscillations can be locked by the forcing period with different ratios.

40|$|In various {{engineering}} applications, {{the solution}} of the Helmholtz equation is required over a broad frequency range. The simplest approach, which consists in solving the system of equations obtained from a finite element discretization for each frequency, becomes computationally prohibitive for fine increments, particularly when dealing with large systems, like those encountered when addressing mid-frequency problems. Alternative approaches involving reduced-order models built via Padé approximations are now well established for systems exhibiting polynomial frequency dependency of second-order kind and for frequency <b>independent</b> <b>excitations.</b> This paper treats systems of more complicated wavenumber dependency, likely to be encountered when applying frequency dependent boundary conditions and/or loadings. The well-conditioned asymptotic waveform evaluation (WCAWE) is selected as the method of choice and the approximated Taylor coefficients are computed by differentiating the continuous frequency dependent models obtained through a fitting process of the system entries. The method is benchmarked first against the Second-Order Arnoldi (SOAR) algorithm on a simple second-order system. Then it is applied to realistic large scale interior and exterior Helmholtz problems exhibiting high-order polynomial or rational frequency behavior. In either case, the proposed methodology is shown to reduce the computational time of the frequency sweep by an order of magnitude when compared to the direct approach. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} in the {{presence}} of a magnetic field the usual low-energy separation of the Hubbard chain is replaced by a ``$c$'' and ``$s$'' separation. Here $c$ and $s$ refer to small-momentum and low-energy <b>independent</b> <b>excitation</b> modes which couple both to charge and spin. Importantly, we find the exact generators of these excitations both in the electronic and pseudoparticle basis. In the limit of zero magnetic field these generators become the usual charge and spin fluctuation operators. The $c$ and $s$ elementary excitations are associated with the $c$ and $s$ pseudoparticles, respectively. We also study the separate pseudoparticle left and right conservation laws. In the presence of the magnetic field the small-momentum and low-energy excitations can be bosonized. However, the suitable bosonization corresponds to the $c$ and $s$ pseudoparticle modes and not to the usual charge and spin fluctuations. We evaluate exactly the commutator between the electronic-density operators. Its spin-dependent factor is in general non diagonal and depends on the interaction. The associate bosonic commutation relations characterize the present unconventional low-energy separation. Comment: 29 pages, latex, submitted to Phys. Rev. ...|$|E
