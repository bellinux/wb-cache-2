6000|$|This {{hollow box}} remembers every foot [...] That danced upon the level grass of the world, [...] And will tell secrets if <b>I</b> <b>whisper</b> to it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Aye," [...] said he, [...] "I {{was looking}} for thee today, and {{wondering}} how soon thou wouldst come. Come hither till <b>I</b> <b>whisper</b> something in thine ear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There {{is nothing}} in the world the matter,' <b>I</b> <b>whispered.</b> <b>I</b> did not want him to yield, though I could not help being afraid in my heart.|$|R
60|$|Much he {{knew about}} {{peerless}} beauties, a mean, miserable idiot! <b>I</b> <b>whispered</b> Herbert.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's the Calvinistic organ-grinder," [...] <b>I</b> <b>whispered.</b> <b>I</b> {{had already}} found a {{practicable}} break {{at the bottom}} of the hedge. [...] "They're going to try to make the monkey climb, I believe." ...|$|R
60|$|I hesitated. Should <b>I</b> <b>whisper</b> {{something}} to him? But what? His immobility {{seemed to have}} been never disturbed. What could I tell him he did not know already?... Finally I went on deck.|$|E
6000|$|Little Blind Fish, {{thou art}} marvellous wise, [...] Little Blind Fish, who put out thy eyes? [...] Open thine ears while <b>I</b> <b>whisper</b> my wish-- [...] Bring me a lover, thou little Blind Fish.|$|E
6000|$|... "You have {{discovered}} {{an excellent way}} of punishing me," [...] he said manfully, [...] "and I submit. Indeed, I admire you the more. So I am paying you a compliment when <b>I</b> <b>whisper</b> that I know you knew." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>whispered</b> my next words, so {{that the}} child in the inner room might not hear us.|$|R
60|$|And {{taking a}} seat close beside him, <b>I</b> <b>whispered</b> the story <b>I</b> had told to Mr. Ranson.|$|R
6000|$|... "They're coming out!" [...] <b>I</b> <b>whispered</b> excitedly, {{and then}} glanced hurriedly around to learn where the sentries were stationed.|$|R
60|$|Whoever you are, now I {{place my}} hand upon you, that you be my poem; <b>I</b> <b>whisper</b> with my lips {{close to your}} ear, I have loved many women and men, but I love none better than you.|$|E
6000|$|I have offer'd {{my style}} to every one, I have journey'd with {{confident}} step; [...] While my pleasure is {{yet at the}} full <b>I</b> <b>whisper</b> So long! [...] And take the young woman's hand and the young man's hand for the last time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Man! did I say so? Do <b>I</b> <b>whisper</b> {{the secrets}} of the Vehmgericht? I say she died that night: and he--he, the heartless, the villain, the betrayer,--you saw him seated in yonder curiosity-shop, by yonder guillotine, with his scoundrelly head in his lap.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>whispered</b> Catherine {{that she}} mustn't, on any account, accede to the proposal: {{it was entirely}} out of the question.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>whispered</b> to Milly that {{it might}} be {{discreet}} for us to move a little way from the vicinity.|$|R
6000|$|... "Go on. Remember {{your second}} resolution," [...] <b>I</b> <b>whispered</b> to the Story Girl, who was {{stalking}} {{along with an}} outraged expression.|$|R
6000|$|With ears intent, {{with eyes}} abased, [...] Like a shadow still my steps thou hast chased; [...] If <b>I</b> <b>whisper</b> aught to my friend, I feel [...] Thee follow quickly upon my heel. [...] Poor wretch, thou fill'st me with loathing; fly! [...] Thou art a spy! ...|$|E
6000|$|I have pressed {{through in}} my own right, I have offered my style to every one--I have journeyed with {{confident}} step. While my pleasure is yet at the full, <b>I</b> <b>whisper,</b> So long! And take the young woman's hand, and the young man's hand for the last [...] time.|$|E
6000|$|... "D'ye want to know? I cry there, {{right in}} the ring, in that clinch. The weeps for me. 'I can't do it, Bill,' <b>I</b> <b>whisper</b> back, hangin' onto'm like a brother an' the referee ragin' an' draggin' at us to get us apart, an' all the wolves in the house snarlin'.|$|E
6000|$|... "God bless you, Lucy!" [...] <b>I</b> <b>whispered,</b> {{squeezing}} {{her hand}} with fervour--"It cannot be that--have you heard anything of Grace's health?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Therefore it {{was that}} my {{thoughts}} turned to flight, and stepping back a pace to check Hiram Griffin's advance, <b>I</b> <b>whispered</b> hurriedly: ...|$|R
6000|$|But we couldn't {{think of}} {{anything}} to say. Directly, however, I thought I must do something, so <b>I</b> <b>whispered</b> to the Indian: ...|$|R
60|$|This {{hollow box}} remembers every foot That danced upon the level grass of the world, And will tell secrets if <b>I</b> <b>whisper</b> to it. (Sings.) Lift up the white knee; That's what they sing, Those young dancers That {{in a ring}} Raved but now Of the hearts that break Long, long ago For their sake.|$|E
6000|$|... "Henry {{whispers to}} me and wants the pause in the {{programme}} interpreted. <b>I</b> <b>whisper</b> back: 'H. P. is up against a bribe, senator's size, and the coons have got him going.' I saw Mellinger's hand moving closer to the package. 'He's weakening,' I whispered to Henry. 'We'll remind him,' says Henry, 'of the peanut-roaster on Thirty-fourth Street, New York.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Something there is, [...] (With my lips {{soothing}} thee, adding <b>I</b> <b>whisper,</b> [...] I give thee {{the first}} suggestion, {{the problem and}} indirection,) [...] Something there is more immortal even than the stars, [...] (Many the burials, many the days and nights, passing away,) [...] Something that shall endure longer even than lustrous Jupiter [...] Longer than sun or any revolving satellite, [...] Or the radiant sisters the Pleiades.|$|E
6000|$|So <b>I</b> <b>whispered,</b> [...] "Dear ELVIRA, say,--what can {{the matter}} be with you? Does {{anything}} you've eaten, darling POPSY, disagree with you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Come, come, there's a good child,' <b>I</b> <b>whispered,</b> {{leading him}} in. 'You'll make her weep too--see how sorry she is for you!' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{seized the}} {{opportunity}} of slightly shifting my position, which had become cramped, and then listened. <b>I</b> <b>whispered</b> passionate prayers for safety.|$|R
6000|$|Oft to my eager soul <b>I</b> <b>whisper</b> blame, [...] 30 [...] A Stranger bid it {{feel the}} Stranger's shame-- [...] My eager soul, {{impatient}} of the name, [...] No strangeness owns, no Stranger's form descries: [...] The chidden heart spreads trembling on the eyes. [...] First-seen I gazed, as I would look you thro'! [...] 35 [...] My best-beloved regain'd their youth in you,-- [...] And still I ask, though now familiar grown, [...] Are you for their sakes dear, or for your own? [...] O doubly dear! may Quiet with you dwell! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Alexis Paulvitch," [...] {{came the}} woman's voice, cold and fearless, [...] "you are a coward, and when <b>I</b> <b>whisper</b> a certain name {{in your ear}} you will think better of your demands upon me and your threats against me, and then you will leave my cabin quickly, nor do I think that ever again will you, at least, annoy me," [...] and there came a moment's silence in which Tarzan could imagine the woman leaning toward the scoundrel and {{whispering}} the thing she had hinted at into his ear. Only a moment of silence, and then a startled oath from the man--the scuffling of feet--a woman's scream--and silence.|$|E
60|$|I {{have not}} whispered {{a word of}} this to Margaret; nor shall <b>I</b> <b>whisper</b> it. I should like to put Mr. Pike on his guard; and yet I know that the {{revealing}} of Mr. Mellaire's identity would precipitate another killing. And still we drive south, close-hauled on the wind, toward the inhospitable tip of the continent. To-day we are south of a line drawn between the Straits of Magellan and the Falklands, and to-morrow, if the breeze holds, we shall pick up the coast of Tierra del Fuego close {{to the entrance of}} the Straits of Le Maire, through which Captain West intends to pass if the wind favours.|$|E
6000|$|Here was {{a pretty}} letter from a fond husband. 'But, ha! proud noble,' <b>I</b> <b>whispered</b> to my heart, 'you and me shall meet to-morrow.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Now Bickley {{pretended to}} consult me who stood {{brooding}} and majestic, {{that is if}} I can be majestic. <b>I</b> <b>whispered</b> something and he answered: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think there's {{anything}} in it, Allan," [...] <b>I</b> <b>whispered.</b> [...] "It {{would be too}} clumsy for any of our friends--and too risky." ...|$|R
