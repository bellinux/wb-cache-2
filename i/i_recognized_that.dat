But I did {{recognize}} the impact because acts were going all over the world at that time. I recognized the bridges that we crossed, the racial problems and the barriers that we broke down with music. <b>I</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>that</b> because I lived it. I would come to the South {{in the early days of}} Motown and the audiences would be segregated. Then they started to get the Motown music and we would go back and the audiences were integrated and the kids were dancing together and holding hands.|$|E

2500|$|On January 18, 2011, Telemundo ad sales veteran Craig Geller {{was named}} Sí TV's senior vice {{president}} of advertising sales. Of his move, Geller stated that: [...] "It's the right time in the right market and Sí TV is the right network. The marketplace is poised for explosive growth and the 2010 Census will validate the fact that bicultural Latinos are absolutely the fastest-growing demo in the U.S." [...] He further stated that the job [...] "was an opportunity he couldn’t pass up". He commented: [...] "Having been a student of the marketplace for as many years as I have, <b>I</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>that</b> the network is ready to take a huge leap forward. At the same time, our audience is growing tremendously. The time has come for advertisers to embrace these consumers, in a culturally relevant way, and the place to do that is Sí TV".|$|E

2500|$|Ellen Burstyn {{was still}} in the midst of filming The Exorcist when Warner Bros. {{executives}} expressed interest in working with her on another project. Burstyn later recalled, [...] "It was early in the woman's movement, and we were all just waking up and having a look at the pattern of our lives and wanting it to be different… I wanted to make a different kind of film. A film from a woman's point of view, but a woman that <b>I</b> <b>recognized,</b> <b>that</b> I knew. And not just myself, but my friends, what we were all going through at the time. So my agent found Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore… When I read it I liked it a lot. I sent it to Warner Brothers and they agreed to do it. Then they asked who I wanted to direct it. I said that I didn't know, but I wanted somebody new and young and exciting. I called Francis Coppola and asked who was young and exciting and he said 'Go look at a movie called Mean Streets and see what you think.' It hadn't been released yet, so I booked a screening to look at it and I felt that it was exactly what…Alice needed, because [...] was a wonderful script and well written, but for my taste it was a little slick. You know – in a good way, in a kind of Doris Day–Rock Hudson kind of way. I wanted something a bit more gritty." ...|$|E

60|$|A fatal question. <b>I</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>that</b> I was defeated. If I {{answered}} no, {{he would}} cut the matter short and wave me to the door without the grace of a word--I saw it in his uncompromising eye; if I said I was a lecturer, he would despise me, and dismiss me with opprobrious words; if I said I was a dramatist, he would throw {{me out of the}} window. I saw that my case was hopeless, so I chose the course which seemed least humiliating: I would pocket my shame and glide out without answering. The silence was growing lengthy.|$|E
60|$|When {{you asked}} me to deliver the Inaugural Address on this occasion, <b>I</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>that</b> I owed this {{compliment}} to the fact that I was the official representative of America, and in selecting a subject I ventured to think that I might interest you for an hour in a brief study in popular government, as illustrated by the life of the most American of all Americans. I therefore offer no apology for asking your attention to Abraham Lincoln--to his unique character and the part he bore in two important achievements of modern history: the preservation of the integrity of the American Union and the emancipation of the colored race.|$|E
60|$|There {{appeared}} to be one continuous procession of well-cultivated farms, little hamlets, and prosperous towns. What interested me most, of course, were the farms, {{for all of them}} had some kind of wood. We passed a zone of maple forests which looked to be more carefully kept than the others. Then <b>I</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>that</b> they were maple-sugar trees. The farmers had cleaned out the other species, and this primitive method of forestry had produced the finest maples it had ever been my good-fortune to see. Indiana was flatter than Ohio, not so well watered, and therefore less heavily timbered. I saw, with regret, that the woodland was being cut regularly, tree after tree, and stacked in cords for firewood.|$|E

60|$|As I {{stood in}} the darkness, wrapped in my scarlet chlamys--for the evenings here are chill--I was {{suddenly}} aware that I was not alone. A tall, silent figure was near me, {{looking down at the}} town even as I was. I could see in the moonlight that he was clad as an officer, and as I approached him <b>I</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>that</b> it was Longinus, third tribune of my own legion, and a soldier of great age and experience. He is a strange, silent man, who is respected by all, but understood by none, for he keeps his own council and thinks rather than talks. As I approached him the first flames burst from the temple, a high column of fire, which cast a glow upon our faces and gleamed upon our armour. In this red light I saw that the gaunt face of my companion was set like iron.|$|E

None other than my beloved old servant and companion, the Hottentot Hans whose loss I had mourned for years! Hans himself who died for me, slaying the great elephant, Jana, in Kendah Land, the elephant I could not hit, and thereby saving my life. Oh! although I had been obliged {{to go back to}} the days of I knew not what ancient empire to do so in my trance, or whatever it was, I could have wept with joy at finding him again, especially as I knew by instinct that as he loved the Allan Quatermain of to-day, so he loved this Egyptian in a wheeled packing-case, for I may as well say at once that such was my nationality in the dream.|$|E

6000|$|... [Dictated March 16, 1906.] We {{will return}} to those {{schoolchildren}} of sixty years ago. I recall Mary Miller. She was not my first sweetheart, but I think {{she was the first}} one that furnished me a broken heart. I {{fell in love with her}} when she was eighteen and I was nine, but she scorned me, and <b>I</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>that</b> this was a cold world. I had not noticed that temperature before. I believe I was as miserable as even a grown man could be. But I think that this sorrow did not remain with me long. As I remember it, I soon transferred my worship to Artimisia Briggs, who was a year older than Mary Miller. When I revealed my passion to her she did not scoff at it. She did not make fun of it. She was very kind and gentle about it. But she was also firm, and said she did not want to be pestered by children.|$|E
60|$|After this Nombe {{became much}} more agreeable. That is {{to say she was}} very polite, her smile was more fixed and her eyes more unfathomable than ever. Evidently Zikali had spoken to her and she had listened. Yet to tell the truth my {{distrust}} of this handsome young woman grew deeper day by day. <b>I</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>that</b> there was a great gulf between her and the normal, that she was a creature fashioned by Zikali who had trained her as a gardener trains a tree, nay, who had done more, who had grafted some foreign growth of exotic and unnatural spiritualism on to her primitive nature. The nature remained the same, but the graft or grafts bore strange flowers and fruit, unholy flowers and poisonous fruit. Therefore she was not to blame--sometimes I wonder whether in this curious world, could one see their past and their future, anybody is to blame for anything--but this did not make her the less dangerous.|$|E
60|$|OUR morning's exertions {{had been}} too much for my weak health, and I was tired out in the afternoon. After Holmes' {{departure}} for the concert, I lay down upon the sofa and endeavoured to {{get a couple of}} hours' sleep. It was a useless attempt. My mind {{had been too}} much excited by all that had occurred, and the strangest fancies and surmises crowded into it. Every time that I closed my eyes I saw before me the distorted baboon-like countenance of the murdered man. So sinister was the impression which that face had produced upon me that I found it difficult to feel anything but gratitude for him who had removed its owner from the world. If ever human features bespoke vice of the most malignant type, they were certainly those of Enoch J. Drebber, of Cleveland. Still <b>I</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>that</b> justice must be done, and that the depravity of the victim was no condonment [11] {{in the eyes of the}} law.|$|E
