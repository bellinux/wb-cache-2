2500|$|Once {{he lived}} in Florida he began taking photos of large estates {{including}} their grounds, their gardens, their specimen plants, the vistas as seen through their gates and sold them for extra income. The owners often voiced the thought that they wished they could be in color as these were the days before color film or digital cameras. To add color he used cotton twisted on a toothpick dipped in paint. In tinting {{he had to get}} acquainted with artist oils. He saw details of leaves and bark. He saw the natural arrangements of branches and trunks and this made him think about structure. Soon he had made the step from shading photographs to actual painting. His first painting was a canvas of a garden scene with a wall and large vases. It was hung in a Baltimore Show. From that painting forward he made time to paint. It was realistic work, always of plants. His early paintings in 1923 were categorized as [...] "Photographic". From there he began painting his series labeled [...] "Realistic" [...] paintings from 1925 to 1928. An unknown artist friend looked at one of his early efforts and made the comment {{that he did not have}} to paint every leaf. The period of details however survived until 1928 when the paintings became more stylized under the tutelage of Leopold Stokowski. This experience came about when Stokowski, a long-time friend of Mrs. Bovington, then employing Mulford as a landscape architect for her estate, told her he was looking for someone to accompany the family to Europe. Knowing the two individuals, she immediately recommended Mulford who accepted eagerly. Stokowski took him to Switzerland, France and Italy where they spent most of the summer of 1928 in the Alps. Stokowski was eager to see Europe through Mulford's eyes. He viewed life in a different way than Stokowski had experienced before. It was Mulford's <b>great</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> explain plant life from his philosophical point of view. Stokowski was the disciplinarian for Mulford. He required a painting every day from him. It was almost by the demand of Stokowski that Mulford created over forty impressions of his experience that summer, the major portions being the French Alps in and around Haute Savoir. These paintings were compiled in a book Stokowski Sees that was privately printed but not published and the book is currently held by Michael Spencer who is still deciding on its future, although many drawings and paintings are held by family members from this era and his memories are recollected in memoir accounts. After his return from Europe he continued to paint with his newfound skills and outlook.|$|E
