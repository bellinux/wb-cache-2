40|$|A {{measure of}} ship speed {{is needed for}} dead {{reckoning}} navigation, docking, and as an input to satellite navigation systems. Ship speed is also used as an input to fire control systems on Naval vessels. The need for an accurate speed measuring device, that measures ship speed relative to the sea bed is thus apparent. All non acoustic logs measure ship speed relative to the water, and absolute ship speed can only be estimated if a knowledge of water currents is available. An acoustic log that provides an absolute measure of ship speed at limited operating depths is the <b>Doppler</b> <b>log.</b> For deep water the <b>Doppler</b> <b>log</b> measures speed relative to the water and it is thus affected by currents. A new development in acoustic logs is the correlation log. The correlation log can measure absolute speed at much greater depths than can the <b>Doppler</b> <b>log.</b> This is because it utilises a wide beam pointing vertically at the sea bed. The. wide beam permits a low operating frequency to be used which implies low attenuation. The high backscattering strength at normal angles of incidence combined with the low attenuation, means that relative to the <b>Doppler</b> <b>log,</b> the correlation log can measure absolute speed at much greater depths. The correlation log consists of a transmitter, which utilises tone burst transmission, and two or more receivers {{in line with the}} direction of motion. The signals received by two transducers will be similar except for a time shift 'T', which is given by the equation T = d/ 2 V, where V is the speed and d the transducer separation. A device based on these principles has been built and tested. Results have shown that the system concepts are viable and will lead to an absolute speed measuring device that can operate at great depth...|$|E

40|$|Knowing {{your speed}} {{over the ground}} is simple {{if you are on}} a surface ship {{equipped}} with GPS navigation. If you are using differential GPS (DGPS) the measurement will also be accurate to a few centimetres per second when averaged over a few minutes. For an underwater vehicle, especially one designed for long transects, the story is quite different. While speed measurement relative to the surrounding water is straightforward measuring speed over the ground is not so easy-it could be 5000 m away. Acoustic Doppler logs have proven attractive, affordable and reasonably accurate solutions to this problem where the vehicle remains less than 200 m or so from the sea bed. Speed errors of less than 1 % can readily be achieved, with some users reporting errors of 0. 1 % after careful calibration. But, in water depths of 1000 m and more autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) can not use any <b>Doppler</b> <b>log</b> presently available. The Doppler technique itself is part of the problem. It requires three or four narrow beams (typically 3 ˚) which, at the sub- 100 kHz frequencies needed for 1 km+ range, results in large and heavy acoustic transducers.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Modem computerised navigation systems on board ships require an accurate log for optimal performance. Traditional electromechanica 1 logs on board merchant ships have generally been replaced by Doppler logs, which refer the velocity to the sea-bed. However, their operational depth is limited and in deep water the velocity is referred to the water-mass some depth below the hull, where it is influenced by ocean currents. The velocity accuracy ultimately depends on the estimated local sound velocity. The acoustic correlation log has acoustic beams similar to a conventional depth-sounder, with a vertically downward propagation direction and a broad beamwidth. Compared to the <b>Doppler</b> <b>log</b> it is affected less by ship pitch and roll due to its broad beamwidth, and the velocity is virtually independent of the velocity of sound and is referred to the sea-bed to a greater depth. Temporal correlation logs use a two-hydrophone array and the time delay between the two received signals {{is used to calculate}} the velocity. The full potential of these logs for world-wide ocean navigation has not been exploited. This thesis investigates the requirements and conditions for temporal correlation logs on board ships to navigate satisfactorily on and off the continental shelf. An experimental temporal correlation log working at high-frequencies with continuous wave propagation is described. It is used to measure the velocity of a tracked platform moving across a water tank and the results are compared to their theoretical values. When fully developed, the log would be suitable for shallow-water operation, and techniques learned can be applied to a low-frequency deep-water correlation log...|$|E
