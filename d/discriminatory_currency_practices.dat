The creation of a regional currency necessarily contemplates an enhanced confederation among countries within a region. In certain respects, this represents a federalist proposition.

Interview recordings were transcribed and analyzed using a closed-loop, iterative coding methodology and thematic analysis was performed.   Interviews were conducted until thematic saturation was achieved.

40|$|Adopting {{the notion}} of Norman Fairclough’s {{progression}} from a negative critique of structures to a positive critique of change strategies (Fairclough 2010, p. 14), the analysis of our financial system and economies must not fail to recognise the novel approaches and prototyping <b>practices</b> of complementary <b>currencies</b> and monetary reform. These novel and extremely diverse practices, ranging from political campaigns for full-reserve banking to local currencies, timebanks, business-barter systems and so called crypto-currencies, highlight a blatant conceptual under-determination of money in legal, regulatory and economist discourses (Costa & Gauvin McNeill 2015; Ingham 1996). While there are no coherent theoretic frameworks to understand all kinds of complementary currencies and “money as we know it” (Blanc 2011), {{the lack of a}} clear touchstone definition of conventional money impedes the recognition of new forms of monetary innovations and the developmental pathways for monetary reform (Bendell et al. 2015) and systemic financial sustainability (Lietaer et al. 2012).
