Belle admits that she does still care for him and Gold warns her to go far, far away, before his death is complete and only the Dark One remains.|$|E
500|$|Although the New York Dolls {{exhibited}} tongue-in-cheek qualities, Gary Graff {{observed a}} streetwise realism in the album's songs. In Christgau's opinion, Johansen's colloquial and morally superior lyrics were imbued with humor {{and a sense}} of human limits in songs whose fundamental theme was authenticity. This theme was explored in stories about lost youths, as on [...] "Subway Train", or in a study of a specific subject, such as the [...] "schizy imagemonger" [...] on [...] "Personality Crisis". He argued that beneath the band's decadent and campy surface were lyrics about [...] "the modern world... one nuclear bomb could blow <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>away.</b> Pills and personality crises weren't evils—easy, necessary, or whatever. They were strategies and tropisms and positive pleasures". According to journalist Steve Taylor, [...] "Vietnamese Baby" [...] dealt with the impact of the Vietnam War at the time on everyday activities for people, whose fun was undermined by thoughts of collective guilt.|$|E
500|$|The {{match was}} a see-saw five setter with Nadal {{prevailing}} 9–7 {{in the fifth}} after 4 hours and 37 minutes. [...] Analyst Steve Tignor summed it up: [...] "This epic was {{a mirror image of}} their last one, in the 2012 Australian Open final. That day it had been Nadal who had survived a near-death experience in the fourth set, won it in a tiebreaker, and taken a 4–2 lead in the fifth before watching Djokovic storm back for the title. Today it was Nole who broke Rafa at 3–4 in the fourth and again at 5–6, grabbed that set in a tiebreaker, and led 4–2 in the fifth before watching Nadal take <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>away.</b> In each of those matches, the loser was haunted by a stunning, crucial lapse. In Australia, with a chance to go up 5–2 in the fifth, Nadal had missed the easiest of backhand passing shots. In Paris, serving at 4–3 in the final set, Djokovic gave away a point when he ran into the net after hitting what would have been a winning overhead." ...|$|E

500|$|David Browne, of Entertainment Weekly, {{noted that}} [...] "Tabloid Junkie," [...] comes as [...] "close to {{transcendence}} as {{anywhere on the}} album" [...] and described the chorus, [...] "Just because you {{read it in the}} magazine or see it on the TV screen don't make it factual" [...] as Jackson's [...] "grabbiest, most driven refrain in years." [...] Although Browne praised the song, he commented, [...] "The rest of the song, however, is mucked up with fake tabloid-TV snippets about his 'life,' and on the verses Jackson's delivery is so terse (he's not singing, he's harrumphing) that his lyrics are all but obliterated. Handed a golden opportunity, he throws <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>away</b> — but then, it wouldn't be the first time." [...] Deepika Reedy, of The Daily Collegian, described the [...] "rust in songs" [...] like [...] "Tabloid Junkie" [...] as having a [...] "raw aspect" [...] that Jackson [...] "hasn't approached since a near-miss with 'Billie Jean'." [...] Patrick Macdonald, of The Seattle Times, noted that [...] "Tabloid Junkie" [...] was a [...] "disingenuous attack on sensational news stories" [...] about Jackson, remarked that most of stories were [...] "planted" [...] by Jackson himself.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Party" [...] {{features}} Beyoncé as {{the female}} protagonist [...] "in {{the mood for}} some loving" [...] as she references to a get-together for two persons. West rhymes about [...] "swag sauce" [...] and [...] "swagu" [...] in the introductory lines, [...] "You a bad girl, your friends bad too / You got the swag sauce, you're drippin' Swagu", before passing the torch to Beyoncé, who begins to sing the first verse slowly and steadily, [...] "I may be young but I'm ready / To give you all my love / I told my girls {{you can get it}} / Don't slow it down, just let it go / So in love / I'll give <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>away</b> / Just don't tell nobody tomorrow". In the chorus lines, she harmonizes over the sample from [...] "La Di Da Di", [...] "Cause tonight's the night that I give you everything / Music knocking until the morning light / 'Cause we like to party". In the second verse, Beyoncé belts out [...] "in a thick stack of smooth, layered vocals". After chanting the chorus for a second time, André 3000 surfaces around the 2:15 mark with [...] "some very naughty references" [...] to milk on the verses he raps, [...] "... another homeboy, that nigga named Cheese / Fuck wit' me baby, I make it milk 'til it drip down yo' knees", before switching gears altogether and getting philosophical about his own career, [...] "Kiddo say he looks up to me, this just makes me feel old / Never thought that we could become someone else's hero / Man, we were just in the food court eating our gyros", and finally adopting a [...] "multi-syllabic tongue twister" [...] to rap some of the finishing lines. The song runs out with Beyoncé reiterating the lines, [...] "Cause we like to party, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey", and West then [...] reprises the opening lines.|$|E
500|$|Marina Galperina of AOL's The Boombox said [...] "from her neon nails, scintillating bathing suits, {{sequined}} mini-dresses, big hair, bright make-up to {{the sexy}} shimmying of her still slim physique, {{all eyes are}} on Beyonce as she serenades a promise to 'give <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>away,</b> just don't tell nobody tomorrow.'" [...] Jenna Gregory of Marie Claire wrote that Beyoncé shows an [...] "amazing bod in parely-there clothes which you definitely wouldn't find in the maternity section." [...] Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound found a 1980s vibe similar to the song's sound, adding that the only thing the [...] "family affair is missing is Jay-Z wearing sunscreen on his nose and a shirt from Tommy Bahama." [...] Ted Maider of the same publication, noted that Beyoncé [...] "adds some luster to the rusty surroundings, shining through as the beautiful pop icon that she has become. It just goes to show it doesn't matter where Beyonce is, or where her music is playing, she can turn any spot into a rager." [...] A writer of OK! said that Beyoncé [...] "don an unbelievable amount of cool oufits, all of which we need in our lives." [...] Rap-Up commented [...] "Summer may be over, but Beyoncé gives us another reason to celebrate with the vibrant video" [...] adding [...] "This is one party you won't want to miss." [...] Andrew Martin of Prefix Magazine described [...] "Party"'s video as a [...] "fittingly shindig-centric affair." [...] Jessica Misener of The Huffington Post praised the fashion used in the video saying that Beyoncé had a lot of [...] "chic looks". Another writer of the same publication praised the decision to make a simple party set. He further described the video as [...] "a gorgeous boast of her beauty as well as a helpful reminder that, even in these down economic times, one can party like a rock star." [...] At the 2012 BET Awards, Beyoncé and Alan Ferguson won in the category for Video Director of the Year after they collaborated on the music video for [...] "Party".|$|E

It would feel odd to have a fifth person back on stage with us". In addition Westlife told Digital Spy: [...] "We'd {{wanted to work with}} him for a long time, but all his loyalty was to Take That and he didn't want to work with another boyband," [...] "We'd been asking him and asking, but literally within moments of Take That deciding to go and work with Stuart Price, he said yes to us straight away. Afterwards he said he'd wanted to work with us for a long time, but he just couldn't do the Take That thing and the Westlife thing because they were too close." [...] "John created a sound for us in the same way he created a sound for Take That, a sound for Bon Jovi and a sound for all the other incredible artists he's worked with," [...] "He created a sound for Westlife that we haven't had before - it's not a massive departure, but it's definitely a step up in terms of production." [...] Filan also revealed that the group is currently in the process of selecting 12 or 13 songs for the album's final track listing from a pool of 16, with all but [...] "one or two" [...] likely to be originals.
