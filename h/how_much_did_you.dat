[...] The words certainly opened the way for Burnamy, but he hesitated so long to take it that the general had abundant time to add, [...] "I don't pretend that this event is unexpected, but I should like to know what reason you have for thinking I should wish you to marry my daughter. I take it for granted that you are attached to each other, and we won't waste time on that point.

I know that you're excited by meeting Mr. Kendricks, and I know what you thought the instant you saw him. But, indeed, it won't do, my dear. It's more than we've any right to ask, and I shall not ask it, and I shall not let you. She is a stiff, awkward village person, and I don't believe she's amiable or intelligent; and to let a graceful, refined, {{superior}} man like Mr. Kendricks throw away his time upon her would be wicked, simply wicked. Let those people manage for themselves from this out. Of course you mustn't get them rooms at the Grand Union now, for he'd be seeing us there with them, and feel bound to pay her attention. You must try for them at the States, since the matter's been spoken of, or at Congress Hall. But there's no hurry. We must {{have time to think}} whether we shall use Mr. Kendricks with them. I suppose it will do no harm to introduce him. If he stays we can't very well avoid it; and I confess I should like to see how she impresses him! Of course we shall introduce him! But I insist I shall just do it merely as one human being to another; and don't you come in with any of your romantic nonsense, Basil, about her social disappointment.

40|$|Essentially {{every living}} thing on Earth has applied the basic {{concepts}} of economics. That is, every living thing {{has had to}} use a limited set of resources to meet a minimum set of needs or wants. Although the study of economics is often confused with the study of markets or finance, economics is simply a social science that studies the choices people make. As a social science, economics {{is the study of}} human motivations. Or, as Landsburg (1993) put it, “most of economics can be summarized in four words: ‘People respond to incentives’. ” Those incentives reflect the value of the trade-offs made between a limited set of resources and an unlimited set of wants, needs, and desires. It is true that the concepts of money and price are often used as proxy values for economic decisions, but markets don’t always reflect the true value of natural resource benefits and prices do not indicate the actual cost of the services provided by natural pro-cesses (Sagoff, 2004). Remember the last time you drove through the countryside on a nice autumn day and admired the beautiful colors. <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> have to pay for this ben-efit?
