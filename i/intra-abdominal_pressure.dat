5|$|The {{most widely}} {{documented}} mechanism {{is that the}} ingestion of food causes gastric distention, which is followed by abdominal compression and the simultaneous relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). This creates a common cavity between the stomach and the oropharynx that allows the partially digested material {{to return to the}} mouth. There are several offered explanations for the sudden relaxation of the LES. Among these explanations {{is that it is a}} learned voluntary relaxation, which is common in those with or having had bulimia. While this relaxation may be voluntary, the overall process of rumination is still generally involuntary. Relaxation due to <b>intra-abdominal</b> <b>pressure</b> is another proposed explanation, which would make abdominal compression the primary mechanism. The third is an adaptation of the belch reflex, which is the most commonly described mechanism. The swallowing of air immediately prior to regurgitation causes the activation of the belching reflex that triggers the relaxation of the LES. Patients often describe a feeling similar to the onset of a belch preceding rumination.|$|E

25|$|The {{diaphragm}} is {{also involved}} in non-respiratory functions, helping to expel vomit, feces, and urine from the body by increasing <b>intra-abdominal</b> <b>pressure,</b> aiding in childbirth, and preventing acid reflux by exerting pressure on the esophagus as it passes through the esophageal hiatus.|$|E
50|$|During pregnancy, {{pressure}} from the fetus on the abdomen and hormonal changes cause the hemorrhoidal vessels to enlarge.

30|$|Increasing intra-abdominal volume (IAV) {{can lead}} to intra-abdominal {{hypertension}} (IAH) or abdominal compartment syndrome. Both are associated with raised morbidity and mortality. IAH can increase airway pressures and impair ventilation. The relationship between increasing IAV and airway pressures is not known. We therefore assessed the effect of increasing IAV on airway and <b>intra-abdominal</b> <b>pressures</b> (IAP).|$|R

25|$|Prior to {{prenatal}} and newborn screening, {{cystic fibrosis}} was often diagnosed when a newborn infant {{failed to pass}} feces (meconium). Meconium may completely block the intestines and cause serious illness. This condition, called meconium ileus, occurs in 5–10% of newborns with CF. In addition, protrusion of internal rectal membranes (rectal prolapse) is more common, occurring {{in as many as}} 10% of children with CF, and it is caused by increased fecal volume, malnutrition, and increased <b>intra–abdominal</b> <b>pressure</b> due to coughing.|$|E
500|$|For {{people whose}} {{injuries}} are {{high enough to}} interfere with breathing, there is great emphasis on airway clearance during this stage of recovery. Weakness of respiratory muscles impairs the ability to cough effectively, allowing secretions to accumulate within the lungs. [...] As SCI patients suffer from reduced total lung capacity and tidal volume, physical therapists teach them accessory breathing techniques (e.g. apical breathing, glossopharyngeal breathing) that typically are not taught to healthy individuals. [...] Physical therapy treatment for airway clearance may include manual percussions and vibrations, postural drainage, respiratory muscle training, and assisted cough techniques. Patients are taught to increase their <b>intra-abdominal</b> <b>pressure</b> by leaning forward to induce cough and clear mild secretions. The quad cough technique is done lying on the back with the therapist applying pressure on the abdomen in {{the rhythm of the}} cough to maximize expiratory flow and mobilize secretions. Manual abdominal compression is another technique used to increase expiratory flow which later improves coughing. Other techniques used to manage respiratory dysfunction [...] include respiratory muscle pacing, use of a constricting abdominal binder, ventilator-assisted speech, and mechanical ventilation.|$|E

Unfortunately, despite examining the influence of positive end-expiratory <b>pressures</b> (PEEP) and <b>intra-abdominal</b> <b>pressures</b> on SVCP and FVP, the authors did not point out {{how important it is}} to assess potential extra-vascular pressures when interpreting SVCP or FVP correctly when caring for critically ill patients...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{intestinal}} obstruction is a disorder associated with intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome. As the large intestine intraluminal and <b>intra-abdominal</b> <b>pressures</b> are increased, so the patient's risk for intestinal ischaemia. Previous {{studies have focused}} on hypoperfusion and bacterial translocation without considering the concomitant effect of intra-abdominal hypertension. The objective {{of this study was to}} design and evaluate a mechanical {{intestinal obstruction}} model in pigs similar to the human pathophysiology. Fifteen pigs were divided into three groups: a control group (n = 5) and two groups of 5 pigs with intra-abdominal hypertension induced by mechanical intestinal obstruction. The <b>intra-abdominal</b> <b>pressures</b> of 20 mmHg were maintained for 2 and 5 hours respectively. Hemodynamic, respiratory and gastric intramucosal pH values, as well as blood tests were recorded every 30 min. Significant differences between the control and mechanical intestinal obstruction groups were noted. The mean arterial pressure, cardiac index, dynamic pulmonary compliance and abdominal perfusion pressure decreased. The systemic vascular resistance index, central venous pressure, pulse pressure variation, airway resistance and lactate increased within 2 hours from starting intra-abdominal hypertension (p< 0. 05). In addition, we observed increased values for the peak and plateau airway pressures, and low values of gastric intramucosal pH in the mechanical intestinal obstruction groups that were significant after 3 hours. The mechanical intestinal obstruction model appears to adequately simulate the pathophysiology of intestinal obstruction that occurs in humans. Monitoring abdominal perfusion pressure, dynamic pulmonary compliance, gastric intramucosal pH and lactate values may provide insight in predicting the effects on endorgan function in patients with mechanical intestinal obstruction...|$|R

30|$|Patients {{received}} 1, 750 [640 to 2, 400] mL of crystalloids in the pre-ICU setting {{after meeting}} septic shock criteria.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to determine the effect of neuromuscular blockade (NMB) on working space in a porcine laparoscopy model. Background: Conflicting results on the effect of NMB on laparoscopic working space are found in literature. Almost all studies are limited by absence of objective assessment of working space or use surrogate outcomes. Methods: In a standardized porcine laparoscopy model, laparoscopic working-space dimensions with and without NMB were investigated in 16 animals using computed tomography at <b>intra-abdominal</b> <b>pressures</b> of 0, 5, 10, and 15  mmHg during multiple runs of abdominal insufflation. Results: No statistically significant effect of NMB on abdominal dimensions and laparoscopic working-space volume was found during CO 2 pneumoperitoneum. In contrast, the effect of pre-stretching of the abdominal wall by a previous abdominal insufflation was found to be significant. Conclusions: This experimental study confirms the results from several clinical studies that NMB does not influence laparoscopic working space. Studies dealing with working space during laparoscopy should take note of pre-stretching bias...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{recently}} developed a novel active implant {{for the treatment}} of severe stress urinary incontinence. This innovative medical device has been developed with the main purpose of reducing the mean urethral occlusive pressure of the current prosthesis. This goal is achieved by detecting circumstances implying either high or low <b>intra-abdominal</b> <b>pressures</b> by a single 3 -axis accelerometer. In fact, posture and activity of the patient are monitored in real time. We investigated in this study the possibility of detecting cough events (one of the main causes of urine loss in incontinent patient) by MechanoMyoGraphy (MMG) of the Rectus Abdominis (RA) using the same accelerometer. We compared MMG signal detection characteristics (burst onset times and RMS values) to the method of reference, the ElectroMyoGraphy (EMG). It is shown that detection of cough effort by MMG presents lower performances, mostly in terms of cough anticipation, than EMG detection. However, MMG still remains a good option for an implantable system comparing to implantable EMG disadvantages...|$|R

40|$|Except for unusual environments(such as outer space, reverse Tren-delenburg position, classrooms, or baby strollers), sleep {{typically}} {{occurs with}} the patient in the supine position. This posi-tion often allows the stomach contents to remain {{in contact with the}} opening to the lower esophagus and provides the oppor-tunity for gastroesophageal reflux (GER) to occur. Going to bed immediately after a meal or conditions with delayed emp-tying increase the amount and proxim-ity of gastric contents to the lower gas-troesophageal sphincter. Obesity also contributes to the likelihood of GER while in the supine position by increas-ing <b>intra-abdominal</b> <b>pressures</b> and decreasing the gastric volume. Because the majority of the factors are present in all sleeping individuals, the likelihood of GER is increased even in individuals without evident disease. Two studies 1, 2 have demonstrated the amount and frequency of GER that occur in healthy subjects.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Laparoscopic {{procedures}} {{are becoming increasingly}} popular, even in the severely ill patient. We present {{a case of a}} cardiac transplant candidate with an ejection fraction of less than 15 % who underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This is the first case in which intraoperative hemodynamic measurements were recorded in a patient with cardiopulmonary disease this severe. Methods: The patient underwent the procedure while measurements were made at crucial intervals (baseline, with incremental insufflation, reverse Trendelenberg, at desufflation) using a pulmonary artery catheter, transesophageal echocardiography with fractional area measurements, radial arterial line, as well as standard monitoring. Results: This patient showed hemodynamic changes consistent with a person without severe heart disease. There was a rise in mean arterial and systemic vascular resistance with insufflation to 10 mm Hg, which was further exaggerated by reverse Trendelenberg. Heart rate and pulmonary artery wedge pressure increased slightly. The cardiac output and fractional area change declined minimally. Conclusions: We conclude that if a patient with congestive heart failure is medically optimized, and <b>intra-abdominal</b> <b>pressures</b> and surgical times are minimized, laparoscopic cholecystectomy may be performed with minimal risk to the patient...|$|R

40|$|Objectives. The {{incidence}} of fentanyl-induced cough (FIC) during induction of general anesthesia varies around 40 % and is undesirable. It increases intracranial, intraocular, and <b>intra-abdominal</b> <b>pressures.</b> This prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated {{the effect of}} dexmedetomidine (DEX) pretreatment on the incidence and severity of FIC. Methods. Altogether 300 patients undergoing elective surgical procedures were randomly allocated into three groups (I, II, III; n = 100) and administered intravenously, over 10 min, 10 mL isotonic saline, DEX 0. 5 mg/kg in 10 mL isotonic saline, or DEX 1 mg/kg in 10 mL isotonic saline, respectively. All groups subsequently received a fentanyl (4. 0 mg/kg) intravenous push. The incidence and severity of cough were recorded for 1 min after fentanyl administration. Results. The {{incidence of}} FIC was 61 %, 40 %, and 18 % in groups I, II, and III, respectively (P < 0. 05 for treatment groups II and III versus control group I).
