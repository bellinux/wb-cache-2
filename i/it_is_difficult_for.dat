5|$|As Vladimir Bukovsky and Semyon Gluzman point out, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> {{the average}} Soviet {{psychiatrist}} {{to understand the}} dissident's poor adjustment to Soviet society. This view of dissidence has nothing surprising about it—conformity reigned in Soviet consciousness; a public intolerance of non-conformist behavior always penetrated Soviet culture; and the threshold for deviance from custom was similarly low.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternate}} route for developing emergency medicine {{is to provide}} additional training for other specialists to equip them to practice in emergency medicine. This has the benefit of being more rapid to implement, as physicians already trained in other areas can add the necessary emergency skills to their repertoire. However, after the initial expansion <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> emergency medicine to progress further in nations that adopt this strategy, as the retrained practitioners identify more with their original specialty and have less incentive to continue to press for further innovations in emergency medicine.|$|E
5|$|Each human player {{controls}} one hero, {{a powerful}} unit with unique abilities. In DotA, players {{on each side}} choose one of 112 heroes, each with different abilities and tactical advantages over other heroes. The scenario is highly team-oriented; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> one player to carry the team to victory alone. DotA allows up to ten players in a five-versus-five format.|$|E

Though such sources must be treated with caution, since they contain demonstrable inaccuracies and contradictions, they provide evidence of the richness and scale of Catherine de' Medici's court festivals.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} {{locations where}} bog bodies {{have been discovered}} are the Northern European countries of Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and especially Denmark. The oldest of these bodies dates to about 8000 BC, although the majority of specimens in Denmark are from the Pre-Roman Iron Age to Roman Iron Age era (about 500 BC to 400 AD). As of 2006, more than 700ancient {{bodies have been discovered}} in these sites, although other estimates have placed the number in the thousands. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> scientists to ascertain a precise number because many of the bodies have been lost or destroyed. Before archaeologists began actively searching for bog bodies, the bodies were discovered mostly during the routine extraction of peat, and then reburied or discarded. After the discovery that systematic conservation of Iron Age bodies was attributable to the acidic anaerobic environs, major excavations have occurred in Jutland. Other bog bodies recovered on the Jutland peninsula which have undergone as extensive an analysis as the Haraldskær Woman include Tollund Man, Grauballe Man, Elling Woman, Huldremose Woman and the Borremose Woman.|$|E
25|$|This plant {{exhibits}} autotoxicity, {{which means}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> alfalfa seed {{to grow in}} existing stands of alfalfa. Therefore, alfalfa fields are recommended to be rotated with other species (for example, corn or wheat) before reseeding.|$|E

25|$|The {{expansion}} and urbanisation of Hobart has destroyed {{much of the}} archaeological evidence of prior indigenous occupation, although Aboriginal middens are often still present in coastal areas.

25|$|Because of the {{two levels}} being {{separate}} on most cars, there is a physical limitation on the conductor, as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> {{him or her to}} verify, collect payment and sell tickets to such a large concentration of passengers in one car on each level, owing to the sometimes short distance between stops.|$|E
25|$|A recent {{increase}} in female longevity due to {{improvements in the}} standard of living and social care has also been suggested. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> selection, however, to favour aid to offspring from parents and grandparents. Irrespective of living standards, adaptive responses are limited by physiological mechanisms. In other words, senescence is programmed and regulated by specific genes.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{difficulties}} in understanding sexual harassment, is that it involves a range of behaviors. In most cases (although not in all cases) <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> the victim to describe what they experienced.

Moreover, behavior and motives vary between individual cases.|$|E

25|$|The most {{effective}} strategy predators use against schooling fish is first to scare them into forming a bait ball. Strategies {{such as those}} outlined {{in the previous section}} can work to a degree against freely streaming fish schools, but work much better if the fish school is first compacted into a bait ball. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> predators working individually to scare a fish school into a bait ball, and they usually work together.|$|E
25|$|Bioindicators {{can also}} be used to {{independently}} confirm autoclave performance. Simple bioindicator devices are commercially available based on microbial spores. Most contain spores of the heat resistant microbe Geobacillus stearothermophilus (formerly Bacillus stearothermophilus), which is extremely resistant to steam sterilization. Biological indicators may take the form of glass vials of spores and liquid media, or as spores on strips of paper inside glassine envelopes. These indicators are placed in locations where <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> steam to reach to verify that steam is penetrating there.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the common}} skate is {{long-lived}} and slow to mature, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> it to repopulate quickly. Coupled with overfishing, {{this means that}} the common skate's population has drastically decreased and it is likely it will disappear entirely unless more is done to preserve it. It is strictly protected within the EU, making it illegal for commercial fishers to actively fish for it or keep it if accidentally landed. Like other elasmobranchs, it is believed to {{have a good chance of}} surviving if released after being caught.|$|E

25|$|Bundle : In {{this pattern}} the planets are grouped {{together}} so that they form a 'bundle' within the space of 120 degrees, or the equivalent of four signs of the zodiac. This intense concentration of planets produces {{a person who is}} equally intense and unrelenting in pursuit of personal interests. Perspective and understanding of others is limited, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> this person to share their lives with anyone. The best course of life for such a person is to enter into enterprises that require deep concentration, persistence and commitment, or to specialise in one area of expertise.|$|E
25|$|Suicide by {{pilot is}} an event in which a pilot {{deliberately}} crashes or attempts to crash an aircraft {{as a way to}} kill themself and sometimes passengers on board or people on the ground. This is sometimes described as a murder-suicide. It is suspected as being a possible cause of the crashes of several commercial flights and is confirmed as the cause in others. Generally, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> crash investigators to determine the motives of the pilots, since they sometimes act deliberately to turn off recording devices or otherwise hinder future investigations. As a result, pilot suicide can be difficult to prove with certainty.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> {{authors and}} researchers, whether {{individually}} or in a team, to spot every mistake or flaw {{in a complicated}} piece of work. This {{is not necessarily a}} reflection on those concerned, but because with a new and perhaps eclectic subject, an opportunity for improvement may be more obvious to someone with special expertise or who simply looks at it with a fresh eye. Therefore, showing work to others increases the probability that weaknesses will be identified and improved. For both grant-funding and publication in a scholarly journal, it is also normally a requirement that the subject is both novel and substantial.|$|E
