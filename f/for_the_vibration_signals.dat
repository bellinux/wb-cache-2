To maintain high efficiency, the operating parameters must be monitored and adjusted promptly to optimal values. In practice, it is either difficult or laborious and time consuming to measure most of the parameters involved, therefore, a quick and economic way to monitor the parameters of interest is essential for system control. <b>Vibration</b> <b>signals</b> from comminution devices (ball mills) were picked up using piezoelectric accelerometers andlor an acoustic microphone.

30|$|As of late, {{some new}} {{strategies}} for blame flag determination with non-stationary signs have been proposed, such as wavelet transform (WT), wavelet packet transform (WPT), ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and higher order spectral (HOS) analysis [10 – 12]. Of these new techniques, WT {{has been proved}} to be more appropriate than FT <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> <b>signal</b> examination due to its high time–frequency resolution. WPT method that evolved from the wavelet can divide the signal into an entire frequency band. However, both method is unable to excerpt non-linear connections within the signal or time sequence and will lose phase information between frequency components. Moreover, both methods is subject to the selection of the wavelet basis function. Once the wavelet basis is set, decomposition and reconstruction will no longer change and will no longer be adaptive to signal analysis [13]. EEMD investigation has specific benefits for describing signals at instantaneous frequency. An intelligent diagnosis method based on better EEMD and SVM with a small number of training sets was proposed by Zhang et al. [14] to solve the problems of the poor decomposition accuracy <b>for</b> <b>the</b> short signal. Based on EMD, Shi et al.

EEMD is a powerful tool for non-stationary signal analysis, but this method is frequently confined to experiments and applied research. Moreover, low computational efficiency limits its application for on-line detection. HOS allows characterization of signals at various confinement levels in time and capacity in signal handling, design acknowledgment, seismology, and machine fault analysis.|$|R

40|$|Research {{efforts have}} {{increased}} {{to investigate the}} ability to quantify localised bearing faults, ie spalls. These efforts revolve around extending the useful service life of the bearing after the detection of spalls. A {{number of studies have}} investigated a linear correlation between the size of spalls and three geometric points that may be recognised in <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> response: <b>the</b> entry into the spall; the exit from the spall; and a third impact point between the first two. The time difference between these points, calculated using different signal processing techniques, has been widely exploited for quantifying spall size. Currently, there are two main challenges: the first is to enhance the entry point, which typically has weak excitation; the second is to distinguish the impact and the exit points investigated in the literature based on the spall size. However, for practical applications, there is no prior rough estimation of the fault size (ie small or large) and a method is needed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> interpretation of responses. This paper provides insights into the movement of the rolling element within the spall region and shows that the rolling element strongly strikes the bearing races at a minimum of two points. A new technique is then presented to quantify the spall and determine the inherent scaling factor without comparison to any reference data. The technique is based on evaluating two root-mean-square (RMS) energy envelopes, one <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> <b>signal</b> and one <b>for</b> a numerical differentiation of this signal.

40|$|Condition {{monitoring}} of rotating {{machinery and machine}} systems has attracted extensive researches, particularly the detection and diagnosis of machine faults in their early stages to minimise maintenance cost and avoid catastrophic breakdowns and human injuries. As an efficient mechanical system, helical gearbox has been widely {{used in rotating machinery}} such as wind turbines, helicopters, compressors and internal combustion engines and hence its vibration condition monitoring is attracting substantial research attention worldwide. However, <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> <b>signals</b> from a gearbox are usually contaminated by background noise and influenced by operating conditions. It is usually difficult to obtain symptoms of faults at the early stage of a fault. This study focus on developing effective approaches to the detection of early stage faults in an industrial helical gearbox. In particular, continuous wavelet transformation (CWT) has been investigated in order to select an optimal wavelet to effectively represent <b>the</b> <b>vibration</b> <b>signals</b> <b>for</b> both noise reduction and fault signature extraction. To achieve this aim, time synchronous average (TSA) is used as a tool for preliminary noise reduction and mathematical models of a gearbox transmission system is developed for characterising fault signatures. The performance of three different wavelet families was compared and henceforth a criterion and method <b>for</b> <b>the</b> selection of the most discerning has been established. It has been found that the wavelet that gives the highest RMS value <b>for</b> <b>the</b> baseline <b>vibration</b> <b>signal</b> will show <b>the</b> greatest difference between baseline and gearbox vibration with a fault presence. Comparison of the three wavelets families shows that the Daubechies order 1 can give best performance for feature extraction and fault detection and fault quantification. However, there are limitations that undermine CWT application to fault detection, in particular the difficulty in selecting a suitable wavelet function.

The flexibility of the WPT and the systematic parameter selection criteria, help in the minimization of interventions by the end user. The method is evaluated using simulated and experimental signals. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The root {{mean square}} (RMS) value of a <b>vibration</b> <b>signal</b> is an {{important}} indicator used to represent <b>the</b> amplitude of <b>vibrations</b> in evaluating <b>the</b> quality of high-speed spindles. However, RMS is unable to detect a number of common fault characteristics that occur prior to bearing failure. Extending the operational life and quality of spindles requires reliable fault diagnosis techniques <b>for</b> <b>the</b> analysis of <b>vibration</b> <b>signals</b> from three axes. This study used empirical mode decomposition to decompose signals into intrinsic mode functions containing a zero-crossing rate and energy to represent the characteristics of rotating elements. The MSE curve was then used to identify a number of characteristic defects. The purpose {{of this research was}} to obtain <b>vibration</b> <b>signals</b> along three axes with the aim of extending the operational life of devices included in the product line of an actual spindle manufacturing company...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{vibration}} source {{separation and}} identification method using the denoising source separation (DSS) technique is proposed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> mixed mechanical <b>vibration</b> <b>signals</b> from engines in ships. Denoising source separation {{enables us to}} extract the source signals from the mixed signals without prior knowledge of sources and their mixing mode, and thus the important source information extracted by DSS {{can be used to}} monitor or actively control engine noises. Different denoising functions such as energy, skew, kurtosis, and tangential functions in DSS are applied to both simulation studies and experimental data to evaluate their separating performances. The tangential function provides the best outperformance with both numerical study and engineering application. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed DSS method is validated by correlation analysis and the frequency marker tracking method. close...|$|R
40|$|Generally, in {{planetary}} gearbox diagnostics, transducers {{are placed on}} the gearbox case near the ring gear. The relative angular position of the planet gears {{with respect to the}} transducer is a pivotal information <b>for</b> <b>the</b> evaluation of <b>vibration</b> <b>signals</b> related to planet/sun gears. This angular position is usually unknown, or it is known with a large tolerance. The present work seeks to propose two alternative methods <b>for</b> <b>the</b> identification of the angular position of the planet gears with respect to the transducer. The first one is based on the study of how the power flows inside the Time Synchronous average of the ring gear, whilst the second method is based on a modified statistical parameter such as the Crest Factor. The effectiveness of these methods is assessed on the basis of actual <b>vibration</b> <b>signals</b> acquired from a faulty {{planetary gearbox}}...|$|R
