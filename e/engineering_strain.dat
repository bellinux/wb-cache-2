In the 1970's and 1980's, A commonly used practice for treating germinated seeds, seedlings, and rootstock was to soak the plant parts in a suspension of K84, a related but not pathogenic species of Agrobacterium, A. radiobacter. K84 produces a bacteriocin (agrocin 84) {{which is an}} antiobiotic specific against related bacteria, including A. tumefaciens.This method, which was successful at controlling the disease on a commercial scale, had the risk of K84 transferring its resistance gene to the pathogenic Agrobacteria. Thus, in the 1990's, use of a genetically <b>engineering</b> <b>strain</b> of K84, known as K-1026, was created. This strain is just as successful in controlling crown gall as K84 without the caveat of resistance gene transfer.|$|E

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{examine the}} {{functional}} {{behavior of the}} surface layer of the meniscus by investigating depth-varying compressive strains during unconfined compression. DesignPairs of meniscus and articular cartilage explants (n= 12) site-matched at the tibial surfaces were subjected to equilibrium unconfined compression at 5, 10, 15, and 20 % compression under fluorescence imaging. Two-dimensional (2 D) deformations were tracked using digital image correlation (DIC). For each specimen, local compressive <b>engineering</b> <b>strains</b> were determined in 200 μm layers through {{the depth of the}} tissue. In samples with sharp strain transitions, bilinear regressions were used to characterize the surface and interior tissue compressive responses. ResultsMeniscus and cartilage exhibited distinct depth-dependent strain profiles during unconfined compression. All cartilage explants had elevated compressive <b>engineering</b> <b>strains</b> near the surface, consistent with previous reports. In contrast, half of the meniscus explants tested had substantially stiffer surface layers, as indicated by surface <b>engineering</b> <b>strains</b> that were ∼ 20 % of the applied compression. In the remaining samples, surface and interior <b>engineering</b> <b>strains</b> were comparable. 2 D Green’s strain maps revealed highly heterogeneous compressive and shear strains throughout the meniscus explants. In cartilage, the maximum shear strain appeared to be localized at 100 – 250 μm beneath the articular surface. ConclusionsMeniscus was characterized by highly heterogeneous strains during compression. In contrast to cartilage, which consistently had a compliant surface region, meniscal explants were either substantially stiffer near the surface or had comparable compressive stiffness through the depth. The relatively compliant interior may allow the meniscus to maintain a consistent surface contour while deforming during physiologic loading...|$|R

50|$|A general {{parameter}} {{that indicates}} the formability and ductility of a material is the fracture strain which {{is determined by}} a uniaxial tensile test (see also fracture toughness). The strain identified by this test is defined by elongation {{with respect to a}} reference length. For example, a length of abbr=on 80 mm is used for the standardized uniaxial test of flat specimens, pursuant to EN 10002. It {{is important to note that}} deformation is homogeneous up to uniform elongation. Strain subsequently localizes until fracture occurs. Fracture strain is not an <b>engineering</b> <b>strain</b> since distribution of the deformation is inhomogeneous within the reference length.
