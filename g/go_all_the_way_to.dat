He was also accepted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

5|$|Liverpool {{were well}} beaten by Red Star Belgrade {{in the second}} round of the 1973–74 European Cup and lost out to Leeds in the League Championship, {{finishing}} second. In the third round of the FA Cup, Liverpool had to score a late equaliser to draw 2–2 at home against lowly Doncaster Rovers but recovered to win the replay and then <b>go</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the final. In what proved to be Shankly's last competitive game in charge, Liverpool produced a superb second half performance to defeat Newcastle 3–0 at Wembley.|$|E
5|$|In the 1999–2000 season, Arsenal {{participated in}} the Premier League. Despite the loss of striker Nicolas Anelka to Real Madrid, the club {{significantly}} strengthened in the summer, signing defenders Oleg Luzhny and Sylvinho as well as forwards Davor Šuker and Thierry Henry. Inconsistent performances in the league against lowly opposition meant Arsenal never posed a serious title challenge, ending the campaign as runners-up, 18 points behind Manchester United. The club had another poor season in the Champions League, finishing third in their group; this won them a consolation place in the UEFA Cup and Arsenal managed to <b>go</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the final, where they faced Galatasaray in Copenhagen. The match ended in a 0–0 draw with few chances for either side to score; it went to penalties and Arsenal lost after Šuker and Patrick Vieira missed their spot-kicks.|$|E

5|$|Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{decides to}} start {{painting}} her mural in the warehouse, {{but has a}} hard time getting started as she is afraid of it not being perfect. Meanwhile, bored with having to fill out customer complaint cards (which he finds redundant because the complaints are already in the computer), Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) uses them to build a card tower in the annex with other employees. The card tower takes on a deeper meaning for the employees when Pete points out that it is composed of failures made by every one of them (excepting only Pam), and thus proves that they should not be ashamed of their failures. They decide {{to try to make it}} <b>go</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the ceiling, but end up one complaint card short. Not wanting to use a blank card as it would defy the point of the tower, Pam offers to complete the tower by getting her first customer complaint. She calls one of their smaller clients, delivers a yo mama joke, and hangs up. The client, whose mother was actually obese and is now deceased, drops Dunder Mifflin as their paper supplier, leaving them simultaneously excited over getting that last complaint and disappointed over losing a client. After celebrating the completion of the card tower, Pam finally starts painting the mural, saying artists should not care too much in what others think, further asserting this by telling off Hide (Hidetoshi Imura) when he insults her artwork.|$|E

25|$|The Centennials {{struggled}} in the 1993–94 season, {{one that was}} truncated by the trade {{of two of the}} team's most dynamic offensive players, Bill Muckalt and Joe Rybar, to the Kelowna Spartans midway through the season.This was a year Merritt would off-load several key players in an effort to rebuild the team. Goaltenders Joe Kennedy and up and coming athletic goaltender Jason Taylor were moved as well along with Rob Szatsmary forward and Ryan Beamin a solid defensemen. Merritt had a tough time, especially after the trades, and finished the regular season at the bottom of both the Interior Division and the BCJHL with a record of 16–39–5 for just 37 points. The Centennials missed the playoffs while Kelowna Spartans would <b>go</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the Centennial Cup championship, only to lose to the Olds Grizzlys. At the 1994 NHL Entry Draft, Muckalt was chosen in the ninth round, 221st overall by the Vancouver Canucks. Former Centennial Mike Josephson, who had moved on to the WHL's Kamloops Blazers, was chosen 196th overall by Chicago.|$|E

500|$|There {{is a small}} {{string of}} faults on and near the main summit caldera, {{arranged}} parallel to the northern coast. The faults were originally regarded to be {{a direct result of}} the collapse; however scientists note the fault lines do not <b>go</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the coast but are arranged tightly clustered around the caldera. [...] This indicates that the fault lines may have been caused indirectly, possibly due to the sudden release of stress during the event.|$|E
500|$|During the {{commutation}} hearing, Slaton asked Dorsey {{to address}} this issue.

Frank's attorney rebutted this by quoting Conley, {{who said that the}} elevator stops when it hits the bottom. Slaton interviewed others and conducted his own tests on his visit to the factory, concluding that every time the elevator made the trip to the basement it touched the bottom. Slaton said, [...] "If the elevator was not used by Conley and Frank in taking the body to the basement, then the explanation of Conley cannot be accepted." ...|$|E
500|$|Above the pylon, {{separated}} by the cornice, {{are the three}} Virtues—from left to right, Faith, Charity, and Hope—in shell niches, {{separated by}} four Corinthian fluted pilasters. Such a motif is unprecedented in Tuscan funerary sculpture but found at this date in Venice, Padua, and especially Cossa's native Naples. As a result, excursions to Venice have been suggested for both Michelozzo and Donatello. However, Janson suggests that one [...] "need not <b>go</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Venice" [...] to find such motifs. Outside Florence, Virtues were common on tombs, with the cardinal Virtues used for laymen, and the theological virtues reserved for ecclesiastics, including the Brancaccio tomb. However, the Cossa Virtues, from their hair to their sandals, are more thoroughly antique. Donatello also produced two similar bronze Virtues for the Siena Baptistry, whose chronological relationship to the Cossa Virtues is unclear.|$|E

500|$|Patton {{developed}} {{an ability to}} deliver charismatic speeches, {{in part because he}} had trouble with reading. He used profanity heavily in his speech, which generally was enjoyed by troops under his command but offended other generals, including Bradley. The most famous of his speeches were a series he delivered to the Third Army prior to Operation Overlord. When speaking, he was known for his bluntness and witticism; he once said, [...] "The two most dangerous weapons the Germans have are our own armored halftrack and jeep. The halftrack because the boys in it go all heroic, thinking they are in a tank. The jeep because we have so many God-awful drivers." [...] During the Battle of the Bulge, he famously remarked that the Allies should [...] "let the sons-of-bitches [...] <b>go</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Paris, then we'll cut them off and round them up." [...] He also suggested facetiously that his Third Army could [...] "drive the British back into the sea for another Dunkirk." ...|$|E

While as young children, they bury a [...] "wish box" [...] and vow to dig it up on the night of their high school graduation, also {{pledging}} to stay best friends forever. However, as they grow up, their friendship fades due to their different approaches of high school: Lucy becomes the introverted valedictorian, Kit becomes the most popular girl in school, and Mimi is an outcast from a trailer park and facing teenage pregnancy. On the night of their graduation, they keep their promise and get together to open the [...] "wish box". As they start talking again, they remember their old wishes while burying the box: Mimi wanted to travel to California, Lucy wanted to find the mother she cannot remember, and Kit wanted to get married. Mimi brings up the topic of going to Los Angeles for a record contract audition. Kit and Lucy try to convince Mimi to not <b>go</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Los Angeles {{due to the fact that}} she's pregnant and anything dangerous can happen. However the next morning they decide to go together but each doing something separate; Mimi going to the audition, Kit visiting her fiancé and Lucy to see her mother in Tucson, Arizona.|$|E

2500|$|The People Mover was {{intended}} to be the downtown distributor for a proposed city and metro-wide light rail transit system for Detroit in the early 1980s; however, funding was scaled back. [...] President Gerald Ford had promised 600 million in federal funds. Plans included a subway line along Woodward Avenue that would turn into a street level train at McNichols and eventually <b>go</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Pontiac, with additional rail lines running along Gratiot and a commuter line between Detroit and Port Huron. Inability of local leaders to come to an agreement led to the 600 million commitment being withdrawn by the Reagan Administration. Yet the People Mover still moved forward.

2500|$|The {{presence}} of obsidian flakes near the cave has led archaeologists {{to conclude that}} Native Americans knew about the caves long before any pioneers arrived in the Oregon country. [...] The first recorded discovery is credited to a local settler named Leander Dillman, who found the cave opening on a hunting trip in 1889. [...] Legend has it that Dillman found the cave entrance while following a wounded deer. [...] After its discovery, he used the cave to cool his venison. [...] The cave acquired its name from a 1923 geology study published by Ira A. Williams. [...] The study also provided the first map of the cave. In 1938 the highway department announced an effort to resume digging efforts originally started by Emil Long to extend the cave beyond the dirt choke. It was speculated the cave could <b>go</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Benham Falls.|$|E

To the south, Patton's 3rd Army was to drive east to Chemnitz, about [...] southeast of Leipzig, but well short of the Elbe, and then turn southeast into Austria.
