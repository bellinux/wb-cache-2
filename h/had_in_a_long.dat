500|$|When it {{was first}} {{released}} in 1941, Ellen Buell of The New York Times called the book [...] "one of the merriest we have <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time", praising the understated comedic aspect of the procession down Beacon Street, as well as McCloskey's [...] "fine large pictures" [...] which simultaneously demonstrate [...] "economy of line" [...] and [...] "wealth of detail".|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} shot in two days in Gallatin and Hendersonville, Tennessee. On {{the first day of}} filming, Swift used a body double in order for both Swift, as the protagonist and antagonist, to appear in one shot.

[...] On the second day, they first filmed a prom scene and, lastly, the football game, both being filmed at Pope John Paul II High School. The school supplied many students as extras, including football players, band members, cheerleaders and students. The final prom scene used the school's decorations for its real prom the next night. When filming for a touchdown, Till was unable to catch the ball, furthering the length of the shoot. [...] "You put a lot of good solid effort in it and it looks good", Swift stated about filming.|$|E

500|$|... "Soulmates" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews, {{with several}} commentators particularly praising {{the performance of}} Aziz Ansari. The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow said Ansari [...] "has somehow {{found a way to}} make Tom petulant, sexist, and materialistic without ever being unlikable". Meslow also complimented the [...] "slight but charming" [...] subplot about the burger cook-off, and said Rob Lowe stood his own against the show's reliable comedic stars Nick Offerman and Chris Pratt. Zap2it writer Rick Porter called [...] "Soulmates" [...] one of the [...] "out-and-out funniest episodes of the season" [...] and provided Ansari with the [...] "best sustained bit of comedy he's <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time". Porter also said he appreciated how the script [...] "wisely didn't make much" [...] over Ann's dating many men, claiming the subtlety of the joke was effective. Andy Daglas of ChicagoNow also said Ansari [...] "stole the show" [...] and that [...] "Soulmates" [...] was an excellent showcase for his character, who had largely remained on the sidelines throughout the season. Daglas said the scenes with Tom mocking Leslie were effective not only due to Ansari's performance, but also because of the genuine loyalty and admiration that had been built between the two characters.|$|E
500|$|Meagan Damore of Comic Book Resources said, [...] "There {{is nothing}} not to love about Ms. Marvel #1: every {{character}} is well formed and distinct; the story, lovingly crafted; the art, meticulously planned and—at times—downright funny." [...] Jen Aprahamian of Comic Vine said [...] "Ms. Marvel makes a delightful debut, showing confidence and heart {{even before she}} puts on a mask. Kamala is not your average superheroine and her stories seem like they're headed in an exciting direction. Kudos to Marvel for expanding its range; amping up the diversity factor {{in a way that}} doesn't feel token or temporary is a great move, and Ms. Marvel is launching with a solid first issue and a world—a universe, even—of story possibilities." [...] Joshua Yehl of IGN said, [...] "Ms. Marvel introduces a vibrant and troubled character that you can't help but love." [...] George Marston of Newsarama said, [...] "Ms. Marvel is a solid debut issue, and that in itself should be a victory not just for G. Willow Wilson and Adrian Alphona, but for Marvel Comics itself... It's not exactly edgy, and Kamala Khan is not exactly the first reluctant teen hero in Marvel's long history, but Ms. Marvel is one of the strongest debuts for a new character that Marvel has <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1915 season opener, a 35-0 {{victory over}} Mt. Union, Yost tried six {{different}} players at the quarterback position. [...] Roehm won {{the competition and}} became the starter. [...] Following the Mt. Union game, The Michigan Alumnus wrote, [...] "Roehm, the athlete who was finally designated for the position in the big games, received his first trial in this [...] clash, and showed to better advantage than all the others." [...] Roehm started again in Michigan's victories over Marietta (28-6) and Case (14-3). [...] After the Marietta game, The New York Times wrote:"Yost's troubles in filing the quarterback position were lessened considerably by the performances of Roehm at the pilot position during the Marietta game Wednesday. [...] Roehm was a reserve halfback last season and equally good at running the ends and carrying the ball through the line. [...] Roehm is the heaviest quarter a Michigan team has <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time, tipping the beam at 190 pounds. [...] He covers ground fast and {{with a little more}} coaching should develop into a star quarter." ...|$|E

60|$|The opened half-door {{was opened}} a little further, and secured at that angle for the time. A broad {{ray of light}} fell into the garret, and showed the workman with an {{unfinished}} shoe upon his lap, pausing in his labour. His few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his feet and on his bench. He had a white beard, raggedly cut, but not very long, a hollow face, and exceedingly bright eyes. The hollowness and thinness of his face would have caused them to look large, under his yet dark eyebrows and his confused white hair, {{though they had been}} really otherwise; but, they were naturally large, and looked unnaturally so. His yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat, and showed his body to be withered and worn. He, and his old canvas frock, and his loose stockings, and all his poor tatters of clothes, <b>had,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> seclusion from direct light and air, faded down to such a dull uniformity of parchment-yellow, {{that it would have been}} hard to say which was which.|$|E

500|$|Rajeev Masand {{also gave}} the film a {{positive}} review, calling it [...] "a barrel of non-stop laughs": [...] "It puts the fun {{back into the}} movies.

5000|$|Claremont {{remarked that}} {{the editor of}} the series gave him far more {{creative}} freedom than he was accustomed to: [...] "So long as I don't violate the basic parameters of the Alien/Predator universe - there's a limit to what we can establish about them, and I'm stretching that by establishing a female Predator - I can do pretty much what I want.
