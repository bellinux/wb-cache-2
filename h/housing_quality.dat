500|$|When the USSR's {{economic}} growth stalled in the 1970s, {{the standard of}} living and <b>housing</b> <b>quality</b> improved significantly. Instead of paying more attention to the economy, the Soviet leadership under Brezhnev tried to improve the living standard in the Soviet Union by extending social benefits. This led to an increase, though a minor one, in public support. The standard of living in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) had fallen behind that of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic (GSSR) and the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic (ESSR) under Brezhnev; this led many Russians to believe that the policies of the Soviet Government were hurting the Russian population. The state usually moved workers from one job to another, which ultimately became an ineradicable feature in Soviet industry. Government industries such as factories, mines and offices were staffed by undisciplined personnel who put a great effort into not doing their jobs; this ultimately led, according to Robert Service, to a [...] "work-shy workforce". The Soviet Government had no effective counter-measure; it was extremely difficult, if not impossible to replace ineffective workers because of the country's lack of unemployment.|$|E

2500|$|Publicly {{sponsored}} {{affordable housing}} projects use public funds or tax breaks {{in order to}} increase the stock of housing available to low income people. In addition, these projects often seek {{to improve the quality of}} the stock, in order to offer [...] "decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable living environments". [...] Green Affordable Housing projects add to those goals by lowering the lifetime cost of units and improving the quality. [...] The concept of the triple bottom line defines sustainability to include economics, social equity and the environment. Affordable housing already addresses economics and social equity. Sustainability measures obviously help the environment, but they can help the economics and social equity of housing projects as well. Housing units with a better design can improve health outcomes. With lower utility costs and improved health outcomes, the projects are more beneficial to low-income households, who are particularly exposed to poor <b>housing</b> <b>quality</b> and increases in general life costs, e.g. for utilities or medical expenses. Economically, sustainable design lowers the lifetime cost of a building. [...] Since the preservation of affordable housing is sensitive to public funding, making affordable housing greener is a logic step to reducing long-term costs and increasing stability. [...] Green design increases the economics, social equity, and environmental impact of affordable housing projects.|$|E

Modeling the new product development process, we demonstrate, how production and marketing agents learn to coordinate their actions in order to produce the optimal product with respect to their incentive schemes. As a coordinating mechanism between marketing and production, we use the <b>House</b> of <b>Quality</b> framework of Hauser and Clausing [6]. The <b>House</b> of <b>Quality</b> methodology, which is used by real firms, contains important information from marketing and production. It is a procedure that facilitates the search for new promising (from market perspective) and feasible products (from a production/design perspective). We found that the <b>House</b> of <b>Quality</b> approach yields higher life cycle returns than the traditional search for new products- especially for a low number of search steps. This is an important finding recommending the application of the <b>House</b> of <b>Quality</b> since the number of search steps directly influences time to market.
