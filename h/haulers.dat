Water is treated at the Central Clinton County Water Filtration Authority Plant in Wayne Township before distribution. The city also provides {{water to the}} Suburban Lock Haven Water Authority, which distributes it to surrounding communities. Lock Haven operates a sewage treatment plant for waste water, industrial waste, and trucked sewage {{from the city and}} eight upstream municipalities: Bald Eagle Township, Castanea, Flemington, Lamar, Mill Hall, Porter Township, Woodward Township, and Walker Township in Centre County. Storm water runoff from within the city is transported by city-owned storm sewers. Curbside pickup of household garbage is provided by a variety of local <b>haulers</b> licensed by the city; recyclables are picked up once every two weeks. The Clinton County Solid Waste Authority owns and operates the Wayne Township Landfill, which serves Lock Haven.|$|E

25|$|So in {{the next}} mining season, when workers and {{operators}} entered into fresh disputes over the 1870 contract, he organized a loose (for the time being) combination of anthracite <b>haulers</b> that uniformly hiked freight rates to prohibitive levels, thereby cutting mine operators' revenues so ultimately to force the miners into accepting wages that the combination wanted.|$|E
25|$|Set netters – also operate gillnets. However, during fishing {{operations}} the vessel is not {{attached to the}} nets. The size of the vessels varies from open boats to large specialised drifters operating on the high seas. The wheelhouse is usually located aft, and the front deck is used for handling gear. Normally the nets are set at the stern by steaming ahead. Hauling is done over the side at the forepart of the deck, usually using hydraulic driven net <b>haulers.</b> Wet fish is packed in containers chilled with ice. Larger vessels might freeze the catch.|$|E
25|$|The {{combined}} nets {{are maintained}} {{more or less}} vertically in the usual way by floats on the floatline and weights on the groundline. They are set on the bottom. After a time depending on the target species, they are hauled on board. Traditional combined nets were hauled by hand, especially on smaller boats. Recent hydraulic driven net <b>haulers</b> are now common. The gilled, entangled and enmeshed fish are removed from the net by hand. Of some concern with this method is ghost fishing by lost nets and bycatch of diving seabirds. Nets combined in this way were first used in the Mediterranean.|$|E
50|$|An {{articulated}} <b>hauler,</b> articulated {{dump truck}} (ADT), or sometimes a Dump <b>Hauler,</b> {{is a very large}} heavy duty type of dump truck used to transport loads over rough terrain. The vehicle usually has all-wheel drive and consists of two basic units: the front section, generally called the tractor, and the rear section that contains the dump body, called the <b>hauler</b> or trailer section. Steering is made by pivoting the front in relation to the back by hydraulic rams. This way, all wheels follow the same path, making it an excellent off-road vehicle.|$|R

The North Penn Water Authority provides water to Lansdale and some surrounding areas. Sewer service in Lansdale {{is provided by the}} borough, which operates a wastewater treatment facility. Trash and recycling collection in Lansdale is provided by contracts with private <b>haulers,</b> although the borough has plans for a single hauler serving all residents.|$|E
25|$|Repin was {{the first}} Russian artist to achieve European fame using {{specifically}} Russian themes. His 1873 painting Barge <b>Haulers</b> on the Volga, radically different from previous Russian paintings, made him {{the leader of a}} new movement of critical realism in Russian art. He chose nature and character over academic formalism. The triumph of this work was widespread, and it was praised by contemporaries like Vladimir Stasov and Fyodor Dostoyevsky. The paintings show his feeling of personal responsibility for the hard life of the common people and the destiny of Russia. In the 1880s he produced many of his most famous works, and joined the Itinerants' Society.|$|E
25|$|Erasmus {{continues}} his experiment with his ward Gilbertus Albans, whom he names his Mentat. After seventy years {{it becomes clear}} that the independent robot loves his “son” even though he has no problem brutalizing other humans. When Gilbertus sneaks onto one of the cargo <b>haulers</b> of the Bridge of Hrethgir containing a Serena Butler clone that he is infatuated with, Erasmus disables the explosive trip mechanism in order to save him. In doing so, Erasmus dooms the entire machine empire. Realizing that hrethgir will rule the universe, he suggests to Gilbertus that he teach the other humans to “think efficiently.” Erasmus apparently survives the battle when Gilbertus smuggles away his memory core.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{the great}} {{economic}} potential for Los Angeles, the demand for Indian labor grew rapidly. Yaanga began attracting Indians from the islands and {{as far away as}} San Diego and San Luis Obispo. The village began to look like a refugee camp. Unlike the missions, the pobladores paid Indians for their labor. In exchange for their work as farm workers, vaqueros, ditch diggers, water <b>haulers,</b> and domestic help; they were paid in clothing and other goods as well as cash and alcohol. The pobladores bartered with them for prized sea-otter and seal pelts, sieves, trays, baskets, mats, and other woven goods. This commerce greatly contributed to the economic success of the town and the attraction of other Indians to the city.|$|E
25|$|Trap setters – {{are used}} to set pots or traps for {{catching}} fish, crabs, lobsters, crayfish and other similar species. Trap setters {{range in size from}} open boats operating inshore to larger decked vessels, 20 to 50 metres long, operating out {{to the edge of the}} continental shelf. Small decked trap setters have the wheelhouse either forward or aft with the fish hold amidships. They use hydraulic or mechanical pot <b>haulers.</b> Larger vessels have the wheelhouse forward, and are equipped with derricks, davits or cranes for hauling pots aboard. Locating fish is often more a matter of the fishermen's knowledge of the fishing grounds rather than the use of special detection equipment. Decked vessels are usually equipped with an echosounder, and large vessels may also have a Loran or GPS.|$|E
25|$|Gillnetters – On {{inland waters}} and inshore, {{gillnets}} can be operated from open boats and canoes. In coastal waters, they are operated by small decked vessels which {{can have their}} wheelhouse either aft or forward. In coastal waters, gillnetting is often used as a second fishing method by trawlers or beam trawlers, depending on fishing seasons and targeted species. For offshore fishing, or fishing on the high seas, medium-sized vessels using drifting gillnets are called drifters, and the bridge is usually located aft. The nets are set and hauled by hand on small open boats. Larger boats use hydraulic or occasionally mechanical net <b>haulers,</b> or net drums. These vessels can be equipped with an echosounder, although locating fish is {{more a matter of}} the fishermen's personal knowledge of the fishing grounds rather than depending on special detection equipment.|$|E

25|$|Drift nets {{are usually}} used to catch {{schooling}} forage fish such as herring and sardines, and also larger pelagic fish such as tuna, salmon and pelagic squid. Net <b>haulers</b> are usually {{used to set}} and haul driftnets, with a drifter capstan on the forepart of the vessel. In developing countries most nets are hauled by hand. The mesh size of the gillnets is very effective at selecting or regulating the size of fish caught. The drift net has a low fuel/fish energy consumption compared to other fishing gear. However, the issue of concern {{with this type of}} net is the bycatch of species that are not targeted, such as marine mammals, seabirds and to a minor extent turtles. The use of drift nets longer than 2.5 kilometres on the high seas was banned by the United Nations in 1991. Prior to this ban, drift nets were reaching lengths of 60 kilometres. However, there are still serious concerns with ongoing violations.|$|E
25|$|Set {{gillnets}} {{consist of}} a single netting wall kept vertical by a floatline (upper line/headrope) and a weighted groundline (lower line/footrope). Small floats, usually shaped like eggs or cylinders and made of solid plastic, are evenly distributed along the floatline, while lead weights are evenly distributed along groundline. The lower line can also be made of lead cored rope, which does not need additional weight. The net is set on the bottom, or at a distance above it and held in place with anchors or weights on both ends. By adjusting the design these nets can fish in surface layers, in mid water or at the bottom, targeting pelagic, demersal or benthic species. On small boats gillnets are handled by hand. Larger boats use hydraulic net <b>haulers</b> or net drums. Set gillnets are widely used all over the world, and are employed both in inland and sea waters. They are popular with artisanal fisheries because no specialized gear is needed, and it is low cost based {{on the relationship of}} fuel/fish.|$|E
