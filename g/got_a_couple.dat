25|$|When he {{returned}} to England, Greig caused more controversy in the lead-up to the 1976 series against the West Indies. Appearing on television to discuss the coming summer, Greig's oratory created controversy when he expounded on West Indies players:I {{like to think that}} people are building these West Indians up, because I'm not really sure they're as good as everyone thinks they are. I think people tend to forget it wasn't that long ago they were beaten 5–1 by the Australians and only just managed to keep their heads above water against the Indians {{just a short time ago}} as well. Sure, they've <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of fast bowlers, but really I don't think we're going to run into anything more sensational than Thomson and Lillee and so really I'm not all that worried about them. You must remember that the West Indians, these guys, if they get on top are magnificent cricketers. But if they're down, they grovel, and I intend, with the help of Closey and a few others, to make them grovel.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the 2011 season, the NFL {{passed a}} new rule that moved kickoffs to the 35-yard {{line from the}} 30-yard line. [...] The change {{was a result of}} a player safety {{initiative}} {{to reduce the amount of}} injuries and concussions that would occur during kick-offs. The rule change directly resulted in a higher number of touchbacks and fewer returns. Hester commented on the situation stating, “They <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> touchbacks but you’ve still got guys bringing it out and at the end of the day that rule is pointless.” ...|$|E

[...] "It started off really good for us, unfortunately they just <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> more runs than us and that's the way it goes sometimes. They played a great game. We stuck together 12 deep from the second the buzzer started, to that end buzzer and no one gave up. I think that we can hold our heads high because of that. I guess the plan is, next four years, Rio we go one more." ...|$|E

500|$|Following the episode's broadcast, the Fox network {{received}} several angry letters and emails from concerned Catholics, who were uneasy with the commercial scene. According to Scully, {{the letters were}} worded the same, and all started with [...] "My family and I have always enjoyed The Simpsons, until last night..." [...] Nevertheless, the letters provoked a reaction from The Simpsons staff, and in an interview, Scully said, [...] "We <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of hundred letters, {{and it was very}} obvious from reading a majority of them that [...] had not seen the show. Some of them were from third-graders, all saying the same thing: 'Please don't make fun of my religion.' Which we all know third-graders are very adamant about." ...|$|E
500|$|Debbi Peterson {{explained}} {{in an interview}} with MTV UK in 1989 about why Prince gave them the song: [...] " [...] really liked our first album. He liked the song 'Hero Takes a Fall', which is a great compliment, because we liked his music. He contacted us, and said, 'I've <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of songs for you. I'd like to know if you're interested,' and of course we were. One of the songs Prince brought to the group was 'Manic Monday', written under the pseudonym of Christopher." [...] Peterson talked about the evolution of what Prince brought them: [...] "It was a Banglefication of a Prince arrangement. He had a demo, that was very specifically him. It was a good song, but we didn't record it like 'This is our first hit single! Oh my God! I can feel it in my veins!' We just did the song, and the album, and then sat back and thought about it." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{campaign}} press immediately expressed skepticism that Reagan {{knew anything}} about Springsteen, and asked what his favorite Springsteen song was; [...] "Born to Run" [...] was the response from staffers.

I love our first record but, holy crap, it was over-produced. We don't nit pick as much anymore, we move on. The acoustic album will be a first as well....We're lagging but we're really hoping the get this acoustic record out first in the spring with a rock record right behind it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Entwistle's wry and {{sometimes}} dark sense of humour clashed at times with Pete Townshend's more introspective, intellectual work. Although he wrote songs on every Who album except for Quadrophenia, he was frustrated at Townshend not {{allowing him to}} sing them himself. As he said, [...] "I <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> [...] on per album but my problem was that I wanted to sing the songs and not let Roger sing them." [...] This was {{a large part of}} the reason that he became the first member of the band to release a solo album, Smash Your Head Against the Wall (1971) which featured contributions from Keith Moon, Jerry Shirley, Vivian Stanshall, Neil Innes and the Who's roadie, Dave [...] "Cyrano" [...] Langston.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, at his rival's stable, {{throughout}} Preakness week(as late as Friday, the {{day before}} the race), Easy Goer's front feet were being soaked in a tub of Epsom salts due to small scratches or cracks on both heels. An ultrasound was also performed on his ankles and knees. Some wondered if these ailments could compromise the chances of both horses. Easy Goer had [...] "problematic, puffy" [...] ankles that he dealt with throughout his career. Trainer Thad Ackel (trained Breeders' Cup Turf winner Great Communicator) stated, [...] "Easy Goer has <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of osselets (enlargements of the fetlock joints usually caused by excess fluid), and it looked to me like there's come calcification there. I was surprised that such a good horse could have ankles like that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Wentz {{began to}} hype the band {{wherever}} possible: from wearing [...] "Pete! at the Disco" [...] T-shirts onstage to mentioning {{the group in}} interviews. Wentz gave a quick shout-out to the band during a press junket {{on the day before}} the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards: [...] "I've <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of bands coming out soon on Decaydance, one being this band called Panic! at the Disco," [...] Wentz said. [...] "Their record is going to be your next favorite record. It's called A Fever You Can't Sweat Out – get it before your little brother does." [...] At the time of the band's signing, all of the band members were still in high school (with the exception of Ross, who was forced to quit UNLV). Urie graduated in May 2005, and Wilson and Smith finished school online as the band left for College Park, Maryland, to record their debut record.|$|E
2500|$|On June 2, 1976, {{the eve of}} {{the first}} test match of the series, England captain Tony Greig was {{interview}}ed on BBC’s midweek sports program Sportsnight. The interview was conducted on the roof of Hove’s Pavilion in Sussex. In the interview, Greig was forced to respond to questions concerning England’s chances of winning the series against the young West Indies' side. Greig described being unimpressed by the West Indian squad. He described the West Indies recent humiliating defeat in Australia and their tumultuous home series against India. Greig explained, [...] "I like to think that people are building these West Indians up, because I am not really sure they’re as good as everyone thinks they are.” He then notoriously claimed, “Sure, they’ve <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of fast bowlers, but… you must remember that (if) the West Indian get on top they are magnificent cricketers, but if they’re down, they grovel. And I intend, with the help of Closey and a few others, to make them grovel.” The insensitive comments only inflamed the racial and colonial implications surrounding the 1976 series. The remark was particularly provocative coming from Greig, the white South African captain of England.|$|E

2500|$|Between flops, it is true, I {{have come}} up with an {{occasional}} hit, but compared to a good boxer's record, for instance, my percentage has been lamentable. I fought a draw in my first fight, stupified everyone by winning the championship in my second, <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of wins with picture rights, then was knocked out three times in a row. Dragging my weary carcass to Hollywood, I was immediately knocked out again, won a big fight some six months later, then marked time for six years as an ordinary ham-and-beaner, picking up what I could. Suddenly I saw a chance and offered to fight for the world championship for a dollar. To everyone's astonishment, I won that championship and defended it successfully for a number of years, winning nine times by knockout, fighting three draws, losing twice and getting one no-decision in Europe. I have just come over to America for a fight, but it was called off at the last moment, one of the promoters having gone nuts and having to have been locked up. Why I'm not walking on my heels after all this, I don't know. Maybe I am walking on my heels. [...] It would be surprising if I weren't.|$|E
2500|$|On November 22, 2013, T.I. {{announced}} that he had signed a deal with Columbia Records, to release his upcoming ninth studio album.

T.I. revealed he recruited Pharrell Williams, who was influential in his move to Columbia, to executive produce the LP, with plans to release the album in early 2014. In December 2013, T.I. revealed although he had originally planned to release Trouble Man II, since getting into the studio with the album's executive producer, Pharrell Williams, he had a change of heart. He stated: [...] "Since we started working on the project and the project started has taken a different shape, I think we're going to postpone that title. We're gonna rework that. I <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of things in mind." [...] He still plans to release the sequel to Trouble Man, however, he said: [...] "All I'ma say is, it's gonna be a motion picture, it's gonna be a theatrical-worthy title. Something that will definitely seem instant classic. I'm thinking something like 'Trap Champion', 'Paperwork,' but whatever it is the subtitle will be 'The Motion Picture'." [...] On December 16, 2013, it was reported that T.I. decided to name it Paperwork.|$|E
