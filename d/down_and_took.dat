5|$|The SASR {{then moved}} to eastern Afghanistan where it {{played a key role}} in Operation Anaconda in March 2002. During the {{operation}} SASR teams were to provide on-location, in-depth operational intelligence and reconnaissance after they infiltrated the Shahi-Kot Valley ten days prior to the operation, and also saved the lives of 24 soldiers of the US 75th Ranger Regiment after their helicopter was shot down, by providing sniper overwatch and guiding in precise air strikes to end the enemy advance as they attempted to overrun the isolated Americans. Up to 300 al Qaeda fighters were later estimated to have been killed as a result of the airstrikes they called-in. Two SASR advisory and liaison officers were attached with the US 10th Mountain Division to help plan the division's air assault operations, and were subsequently involved in heavy fighting after the unit they were with became pinned <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> a number of casualties. Supported by heavy close air support they were evacuated by helicopter that evening.|$|E

At the line, Clack saw the play clock winding <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> {{it upon himself to}} snap it with 31 seconds left in the game to avoid a delay-of-game penalty, which would have stopped the clock and cost the Giants five yards. Had the Giants knelt on the {{subsequent}} play, there still would have been one second left on the game clock once the play clock ran down, requiring a fourth-down play to be run (the play clock at the time ran for 30 seconds; it now runs for 40).|$|E

The four of the five men were arrested, held on $350,000 bail, spent three days in jail under protective custody, and all charged with first-degree rape, which carries a possible 25 year sentence. Rondell Bedward was also suspended from Hofstra.|$|E

On November 18, 2002, a grand jury issued a subpoena demanding that the administrator of the Guam Superior Court release all records relating to the contract. On November 19, 2002, U.S. Attorney Frederick A. Black, the chief prosecutor for Guam and the instigator of the indictment, was unexpectedly demoted and removed from the office he had held since 1991.

25|$|The {{first group}} of Muslims {{to come to the}} UK in {{significant}} numbers, in the 18th century, were lascars (sailors) recruited from the Indian subcontinent, largely from the Bengal region, to work for the East India Company on British ships, some of whom settled <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> local wives. Due to the majority being lascars, the earliest Muslim communities were found in port towns. Naval cooks also came, many of them from the Sylhet Division of the Bengal Presidency in British India (now in Bangladesh). One of the most famous early Asian immigrants to England was the Bengali Muslim entrepreneur Sake Dean Mahomet, a captain of the East India Company who in 1810 founded London's first Indian restaurant, the Hindoostanee Coffee House. He is also reputed for introducing shampoo and therapeutic massage to the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Florida {{started the}} fourth quarter with a new quarterback, Mickey Ellenburg, who then led the Gators {{into the end zone}} with a 14-yard pass to Perry McGriff, tying the game at 7–7. LSU {{received}} the kickoff and were forced to punt shortly after. Florida again began a drive down the field but were intercepted by Cannon at the LSU 18-yard line, who then lateraled to Hendrix, who ran it down to LSU's 40. Rabb completed a pass to Brodnax and Cannon rushed four times for twenty yards to get LSU within eight yards of the end zone. After two incomplete passes by Rabb, Cannon tried a run up the middle, but was stopped by Heckman for a one-yard gain to bring up fourth down. Dietzel then allowed the play clock to run <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> a five-yard delay of game penalty to give Tommy Davis a better angle for a field goal attempt. From the 19-yard line, Davis stepped back and kicked it through the uprights to give LSU a 10–7 lead with 2:59 left in the game. Florida was unable to score on its final possession.|$|E

500|$|Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. Adam Sessler of X-Play stated: [...] "Whether it's a decade-late {{answer to the}} Marvel vs. Capcom team up games or an off-the-cuff boardroom joke gone wildly too far, Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe is destined to make just about anyone's shortlist of bizarre video game team-ups. Still, sometimes two disparate things can merge to create a unique synergy that makes the melding work, however unlikely it may have seemed at the outset." [...] In GamePro, Sid Shuman called it [...] "surprisingly enjoyable." [...] Wired.com's preview stated {{that the concept of}} the game was [...] "nose-pokingly ludicrous", noting that Superman's powers could be used to easily defeat a character with the comment, [...] "from Sub-Zero to Well-Done in eight seconds flat." [...] ABC News praised the game's story because it did [...] "a great job of giving players a cohesive, if far-fetched, story line that's fun if not engaging," [...] as well as [...] "comic book-like" [...] dialogue. Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universes Kombo Challenge mode was criticized as a thin and frustrating mode with combos that required very precise timing. The modes of Klose Kombat and Free-fall Kombat were praised as concepts but were criticized in their execution as they appeared to slow the gameplay <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> the player out of the fast gameplay experience.
