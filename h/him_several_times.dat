Shah's plans were intercepted by the emperor, who imprisoned <b>him</b> <b>several</b> <b>times.</b> From 1696 to 1707, he was governor of Akbarabad (later known as Agra), Kabul and Lahore.|$|E
5|$|John Fine, on {{the other}} hand, {{suggests}} that the first peace between Athens and Persia was concluded in 450–449BC, due to Pericles' calculation that ongoing conflict with Persia was undermining Athens' ability to spread its influence in Greece and the Aegean. Kagan believes that Pericles used Callias, a brother-in-law of Cimon, {{as a symbol of}} unity and employed <b>him</b> <b>several</b> <b>times</b> to negotiate important agreements.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Janet gets pregnant, the {{officers}} are baited into chasing a reckless driver {{into an apartment}} complex, where they are ambushed by {{the same group of}} Latino gang members. They fight their way into an alley, where Taylor is shot in the chest. As Zavala desperately attends to his partner, the assassins arrive and shoot <b>him</b> <b>several</b> <b>times</b> in the back, killing him. Police backup eventually arrives and the gangsters are brutally slain after refusing to surrender.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the game, {{he has a}} {{rivalry with}} Seifer Almasy. The opening {{sequence}} features the duel where Squall receives his facial scar (giving Seifer a mirror image), and scenes where Squall and Seifer are supposed to cooperate are characterized by squabbles between the cadets. Although Seifer later allies with the Sorceress (requiring Squall to fight <b>him</b> <b>several</b> <b>times),</b> Squall still feels a camaraderie with him.|$|E
5|$|In August 1922, a {{traveling}} salesman named Jack Eaton {{was arrested for}} allegedly assaulting several young girls. The girls' parents refused to press charges, and Eaton was released. Later, he was captured by a mob, who cut <b>him</b> <b>several</b> <b>times</b> and poured turpentine into his wounds. An investigation found that the Scott County sheriff had willfully delivered Eaton to the mob, and Morrow removed him from office. Though Eaton was a white man, blacks were elated with the removal because they hoped it would encourage other jailers to step up efforts to protect against lynchings and mob violence.|$|E
5|$|While {{generally}} {{successful with}} his race horses, Zayat's goal {{of winning the}} Kentucky Derby eluded <b>him</b> <b>several</b> <b>times,</b> including three second-place finishes, until his win with American Pharoah. He also filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in 2010 when a bank called a note due and tried to foreclose on his horses. Zayat Stables successfully completed its Chapter 11 reorganization, but Zayat was next plagued by legal issues related to his penchant for betting {{large sums of money}} on horse racing. Nonetheless, Zayat generated considerable positive publicity on social media for his efforts to save his racehorse Paynter from life-threatening health problems, a successful struggle that earned the colt the 2012 NTRA Moment of the Year Award and Secretariat Vox Populi Award.|$|E

5|$|A beggar woman {{enters the}} shop {{in search of}} Bamford, and Johanna hides in the trunk. The woman recognizes Todd, but upon hearing Turpin coming, Todd kills her and sends her through a {{trapdoor}} in the floor. As Turpin enters, Todd explains that Johanna had repented and is coming to him, then offers a free shave in the meantime. When Turpin finally recognizes Todd as Benjamin Barker, Todd stabs <b>him</b> <b>several</b> <b>times,</b> cuts his throat and sends his body down a trap door to the bakehouse, killing him. Johanna comes out of her hiding place, still in disguise, and Todd prepares to kill her as well, not recognizing her as his daughter. However, hearing Mrs. Lovett scream in horror in the basement after discovering Turpin's body, Todd lets Johanna go.|$|E
5|$|I sent MalcolmX {{some rough}} {{chapters}} to read. I was appalled {{when they were}} soon returned, red-inked in many places where he had told of his almost father-and-son relationship with Elijah Muhammad. Telephoning MalcolmX, I {{reminded him of his}} previous decisions, and I stressed that if those chapters contained such telegraphing to readers of what was to lie ahead, then the book would automatically be robbed of some of its building suspense and drama. MalcolmX said, gruffly, 'Whose book is this?' I told him 'yours, of course,' and that I only made the objection in my position as a writer. But late that night MalcolmX telephoned. 'I'm sorry. You're right. I was upset about something. Forget what I wanted changed, let what you already had stand.' I never again gave him chapters to review unless I was with <b>him.</b> <b>Several</b> <b>times</b> I would covertly watch him frown and wince as he read, but he never again asked for any change in what he had originally said.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{of their}} 38 matches {{have been on}} clay which is {{statistically}} Nadal's best surface and Federer's worst, with 13 being in finals. Nadal has a winning record on outdoor hard courts (8–6) and clay (13–2), while Federer leads on grass (2–1) and indoor hard courts (5–1). Because tournament seedings are based on rankings, 24 of their matches have been in tournament finals which have included an all-time record 9 Grand Slam tournament finals. From 2006 to 2008 they played in every French Open and Wimbledon final. Nadal won six of the nine, losing the first two Wimbledon finals. Four of these finals were five set-matches (2007 and 2008 Wimbledon, 2009 and 2017 Australian Open), with the 2008 Wimbledon final being lauded as the greatest match ever by many long-time tennis analysts. Thirteen of their 38 meetings have reached a deciding set. They have also played in 12 Masters Series finals, including their lone five-hour match at the 2006 Rome Masters which Nadal won in a fifth-set tie-break having saved two match points and at the 2005 Miami Masters where Federer came back from 2 sets down to win in nearly 4 hours. They also contested {{the final of the}} ATP World Tour Finals in 2010 with Federer winning in 3 sets. Nadal has defeated Federer on grass in Wimbledon (which is Federer's better surface) but Federer {{has not been able to}} beat Nadal on clay in Roland Garros losing to <b>him</b> <b>several</b> <b>times.</b>|$|E
50|$|In in 2004, Bodrožić {{became the}} W.P.K.C. super heavyweight muay thai world champion, beating Hungarian Peter Varga in five rounds, {{dropping}} <b>him</b> down <b>several</b> <b>times.</b> In April 2004, {{he participated in}} K-1 Italy's Grand Prix 2004 in Milan losing to Jörgen Kruth in the semi finals.|$|R

5|$|Rudd was {{offering}} generous terms that few competitors {{could hope to}} even come close to. If Lobengula agreed, Rudd's backers would furnish the king with 1,000 Martini–Henry breech-loading rifles, 100,000 rounds of matching ammunition, a steamboat on the Zambezi (or, if Lobengula preferred, a lump sum of £500), and £100 a month in perpetuity. More impressive to the king than the financial aspects of this offer were the weapons: he {{had at the time}} between 600 and 800 rifles and carbines, but almost no ammunition for them. The proposed arrangement would lavishly stock his arsenal with both firearms and bullets, which might prove decisive in the event of conflict with the South African Republic. The weapons might also help him keep control of the more rambunctious factions amid his own impis. Lobengula had Helm go over the document with <b>him</b> <b>several</b> <b>times,</b> in great detail, to ensure that he properly understood what was written. None of Rudd's alleged oral conditions were in the concession document, making them legally unenforceable (presuming they indeed existed), but the king apparently regarded them as part of the proposed agreement nonetheless.|$|E
5|$|The teams {{proceeded}} to The Oval for the Fifth Test. England elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Dewes and Hutton opened for England. Dewes took a single from Lindwall's opening over and thus faced {{the start of}} the second over, which was bowled by Miller, who had troubled him in the past and dismissed <b>him</b> <b>several</b> <b>times.</b> During his short innings, Dewes was visibly nervous and kept on moving around, unable to stand still. Miller caused a stoppage after his first ball to sprinkle sawdust on the slippery and damp crease. With his second ball, he bowled Dewes—who was playing across the line—middle stump for one with an inswinger to leave England at 1/2. He then removed Jack Crapp caught behind from an outside edge for a 23-ball duck, leaving England at 4/23 as play was adjourned for lunch. The paceman ended with 2/5 from eight overs; Lindwall took 6/20 and England were all out for 52. In his last Test innings for the summer, Miller scored five before overbalancing and being stumped. Australia made 389 and led by 337 on the first innings on the second afternoon. Bowling for the second time, Miller struck Crapp {{in the head with a}} bouncer, before bowling him for nine. He then extracted an edge from Hutton—who fell for 64, having top-scored in both innings—to wicket-keeper Tallon, leaving England at 4/153. Miller ended with 2/22 as Australia won by an innings and took a 4–0 series win.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Todd {{returns to}} Llanview {{to check on}} Dani, who had {{previously}} phoned <b>him</b> <b>several</b> <b>times.</b> He witnesses Dani collapse from a drug overdose due to her abuse of oxycodone. While she is recovering at the hospital, an alive Victor arrives. A surprised Téa, Dani, and Jack welcome Victor back, while Todd tries to bond with his children. Todd remains concerned about Jack and Dani, attempting to buy their affections with money and deciding {{the best way to}} win them over is to call a truce with Victor. He also tries to win back Blair's affections. He eventually admits he only pretended to get along with Victor to lure him into a false sense of security. Victor admits that he poisoned Todd's scotch with arsenic and then tried to strangle him. Jack takes Todd to the hospital, where he recovers but is frustrated when his family continues to defend Victor. Victor realizes he must leave town and says goodbye to his family. Todd shows Blair a threatening note he received with the names of all his loved ones on it. The mysterious Tattoo Organization that held Victor demands that Todd find and kill Victor. Todd, Blair and Téa devise a scheme to fool this organization into believing Victor is dead. Feeling secure that their scheme has worked, they plan for a future. Todd receives another note by the Tattoo Organization, this time telling him that he failed them and that Victor has been recaptured. Todd is told that he must leave Llanview and go to the address given on the note. Todd and Blair are devastated. Todd says goodbye to Viki and his children, but does not tell them the real reason he is leaving is to protect their family. Before Todd leaves, he and Blair make love one last time, and it is revealed that they have remarried.|$|E

50|$|Although Buruca {{was short}} height {{to play as}} goalkeeper, his intuition made him to be just in time under the goal.

60|$|Mr. Bundercombe was thoughtful, I am {{convinced}} that {{at that moment the}} germs of certain ideas which bore fruit a little later on were born in his mind.
