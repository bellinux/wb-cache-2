[...] To which Jeff's response was [...] "There are two categories for the answer: [...] one {{is to look at}} neuroscience, and the other is methods for machine intelligence. In the neuroscience realm there are many predictions that we can make, and those can be tested. If our theories explain a vast array of neuroscience observations then it tells us that we’re on the right track. In the machine learning world they don’t care about that, only how well it works on practical problems. In our case that remains to be seen. To the extent you can solve a problem that no one was able to solve before, people will take notice." ...|$|E

La Russa expressed support for the Tea Partiers' {{right to free speech}} to protest at the ballpark. He also stated, [...] "I'm actually a supporter of what Arizona is <b>doing...</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> people don't fix their problems they {{have to take care of}} it themselves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that <b>if</b> I <b>did</b> {{it would}} not be more terrible, Preacher? How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> indeed that this is not your last journey from which there is no return?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did have," [...] {{answered}} Joe. [...] "I hope {{my brother}} and the others round them up. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> they came anywhere near here?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Where is {{the other}} person who came here with Mrs. Wagner?" [...] the widow asked. [...] "A man with an odd English name. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> Minna, <b>if</b> they have found a room for him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, ah!' {{interrupted}} Jonas. 'Years {{have made}} her all right enough. Nobody doubts that. But you haven't answered what I asked you. Of course, you're not obliged to <b>do</b> it, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't like. You're the best judge.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's hard to say. I'll {{allow that}} they've {{worked through the}} muskeg and the bluffs pretty thoroughly; but <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> they've made a good search round Prescott's house?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have come}} {{to look for a}} black ox, branded with a heart and a 'W' inside of the heart. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> your uncle has seen it on the place anywhere?" ...|$|E

He is mentioned in the lines [...] "Well <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> when you're famous you could kill your wife / and there's no such thing as 25 to life / as long as you got the cash to pay for Cochran." [...] A former mayor of Washington, D.C., Marion Barry [...] - [...] who was convicted on drug charges [...] - [...] is also mentioned in the lyrics: [...] "and <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were caught and you were smokin' crack / McDonald's wouldn't even wanna take you back / you could always just run for mayor of D.C." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sailors are awfully jolly fellows," [...] Frank {{confided to}} me one evening, after a day spent in {{exploring}} and setting up instruments.

6000|$|... "That is {{much what}} I was told," [...] she said. [...] "But it was added that M. de La Tour d'Azyr {{had gone to}} the theatre {{expressly}} for the purpose of breaking finally with La Binet. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> that was so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I {{think she}} {{believed}} what she said, and I {{think that she}} has some sort of power. She seemed disappointed when I refused, and, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> it, <b>if</b> {{it had not been}} for Arthur, I do not think that I should have refused. I love power, or rather knowledge; but then I love Arthur more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Walworth. Burn this {{as soon as}} read. Early in the week, or say Wednesday, <b>you</b> might <b>do</b> what <b>you</b> <b>know</b> of, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> felt {{disposed}} to try it. Now burn." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "True," [...] Gavin said, uncomfortably, {{while the}} Egyptian again toyed with her ring. She was too {{impulsive}} to be reticent except now and then, {{and suddenly she}} said, [...] "You have looked at this ring before now. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had it on your finger you would be more worth robbing than with eighty pounds in each of your pockets?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The coffee's very good; may I {{have some}} more?" [...] he resumed. [...] "We used green tea, because it's light and goes far; but I mustn't bother you about our housekeeping. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> {{the police have}} brought back the game warden?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very like, indeed, {{except the}} forehead. His is broad and benevolent, yours high and arched. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> {{you had no}} beard, and wore your hair long, I really think you'd look like Milton," [...] added Rose, sure that would please him.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Farnaby was {{satisfied}} at last, and owned it without reserve. [...] "My own opinion," [...] she said, [...] "exactly expressed! don't be surprised. Didn't I tell you I had no family prejudices? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> {{he has spoken}} to my husband, yet?" ...|$|E
60|$|MRS DUBEDAT. Oh, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> only <b>knew</b> {{the other}} side of him as I <b>do!</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> doctor, that <b>if</b> Louis honored himself by a really bad action, I should kill myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "There," [...] he continued, after a pause, [...] "that's right, now steady. Listen. A {{week ago}} that girl went down {{just like this}} to Indian Spring.

I didn't come across her anywhere. But two men that I met thought they recognized her in a disguise going into the woods. Not suspecting anything, I went after her; saw her at a distance {{in the middle of the}} woods in another dress that I can swear to, and was just coming up to her when she vanished--went like a squirrel up a tree, or down like a gopher in the ground, but vanished." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You have {{no right}} to say that. How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know?</b> <b>If</b> {{you are not going to}} read her letter, you had better say so at once. I dont want to pry into it: I only want to know what is become of Marian." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The motive {{may have}} been revenge, but as Señor Brandon was stabbed that ought to satisfy his enemy. Besides, these people are unstable; they do not even indulge in hatred long. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> your comrade has taken any part in {{political}} intrigue?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, do {{you think}} so?" [...] the gawky young man jerked out with evident pleasure. [...] "Now, that's awfully kind of you. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>if</b> YOU tell me I ought to stay in England, I've half a mind... I'll cable over this very day and refuse the appointment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{you shall}} not be asked. I will not be cruel to <b>you.</b> But <b>do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>know</b> that <b>if</b> I ask {{anything}} it is {{with a view to}} your own good?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mebbe <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> and mebbe <b>you</b> don't <b>know,</b> but anyway, I'm {{going to}} stop your breath till <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>know.</b> And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> lift a hand, I'll blow your head off!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Especially {{after her}} kind nursing of me, and even, with more reason, {{it would not}} be {{becoming}} in us to make changes.
