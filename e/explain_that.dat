5|$|After the Morris {{family and}} Clay {{discover}} that the gates have been locked to prevent their escape, the monsters surround them. In anger, Lizzy tries to remove a mask {{from one of the}} monsters, which she discovers is actually the Horror's face. The Horrors <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> they are monsters, but that the visitors' experiences were part of a television show. As an apology, the monsters say that they will lead them towards a new car, but they are led to carnivorous animals.|$|E
5|$|Few films {{before the}} late 1970s about the Vietnam War {{actually}} depicted combat. The exceptions included The Green Berets (1968). Critics such as Basinger <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> Hollywood avoided the subject because {{of opposition to}} United States involvement in the Vietnam War, making the subject divisive; in addition, the film industry was in crisis, and the army {{did not wish to}} assist in making anti-war films.|$|E
5|$|My Body, the Hand Grenade is {{the first}} and only {{compilation}} album to be released by Hole. The liner notes also <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> the compilation was put together to document Hole's progression from the punk-influenced Pretty on the Inside (released in 1991) to their more restrained, alternative rock-based Live Through This (released in 1994). The album was dedicated to former Hole bassist Kristen Pfaff and Kurt Cobain, both of whom died in 1994.|$|E
50|$|To this, a {{footnote}} to the 8th line read <b>explaining</b> <b>that</b> the reference {{was to the}} Earl of Chatham and {{a footnote}} to the 12th line <b>explaining</b> <b>that</b> the reference was to Justice.|$|R
50|$|The Bahá'í {{writings}} for {{the most}} part are silent on specific scientific issues, <b>explaining</b> <b>that</b> most of this is the work of future scientists. `Abdu'l-Bahá <b>explains</b> <b>that</b> science is a progressive field which will continually progress in further and further ways.|$|R
25|$|Glyceranus asks Mystes why he {{is being}} quiet. Mystes <b>explains</b> <b>that</b> it is because he is worried. Mystes <b>explains</b> <b>that</b> {{the source of his}} worries is over-abundance (satias). Glyceranus invites Mystes to tell him more, under the shade of an elm tree.|$|R
5|$|Tintin and Captain Haddock {{are walking}} through the {{countryside}} of the fictional Marlinshire when they come across a Romani community camped in a garbage dump, and reunite a lost little girl named Miarka with her family there. The Romani <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> {{they are not allowed}} to camp anywhere else so Haddock invites them to the grounds of his estate, Marlinspike Hall.|$|E
5|$|Up to this point, Australia's {{performances}} {{had been}} poor, and winter athletes were often derided by the summer-dominated administrators. During one meeting, a cross-country representative {{asked for the}} selection of six athletes, prompting the selection committee chairman to interject. The chairman said that a seventh place would be needed, {{and went on to}} <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> a dog was required to find the athletes after they got lost in the snow. The majority of his colleagues burst into laughter.|$|E
5|$|Zara Yaqob sent {{delegates to}} the Council of Florence in 1441, and {{established}} ties with the papacy and Western Christianity. They were confused when council prelates insisted on calling their monarch Prester John. They tried to <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> nowhere in Zara Yaqob's list of regnal names did that title occur. However, the delegates' admonitions did little to stop Europeans from referring to the monarch as their mythical Christian king, Prester John.|$|E
50|$|Varzil the Good, Keeper of Neskaya, <b>explains</b> <b>that</b> {{several other}} Towers have joined The Compact, since the recent {{destruction}} of Hali. He <b>explains</b> <b>that</b> Bard is a pivot around which history flows, and that Bard's acceptance of The Compact will help unify Darkover.|$|R
5000|$|David Pardo <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> in Tosefta it is <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> {{selectively}} choosing {{one group}} of servants to the King (God) exemplifies and portrays {{the grandeur of the}} King by showing that not all could merely [...] "show up" [...] and begin serving.|$|R
50|$|Harris <b>explains</b> <b>that</b> {{debates and}} {{disagreement}} {{are a part}} of the scientific method, and that one side can certainly be wrong. He also <b>explains</b> <b>that</b> all the debates still available to science illustrate how much work could still be done, and how much conversation must continue.|$|R
5|$|According to Packer, {{another common}} theme in Gordimer's novels is the choices {{ordinary}} {{people who live}} in oppressive regimes are forced to make. Literary critics Turgeon and Carli Coetzee <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> when she realises that whites are not always welcome in the anti-apartheid liberation movements, Rosa repudiates her father's struggle and leaves the country. Marsh-Lockett says that part of Rosa's struggle is forging her own identity, and this decision to rebel against her dead father is a bold step, although she does return later to South Africa to become a committed activist and ultimately a political prisoner. But, according to Coetzee, what Rosa achieves is what her father never could: to have a life of her own while still remaining politically committed.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the emperor Lebna Dengel and the Portuguese had {{established}} diplomatic {{contact with each other}} in 1520, Prester John was the name by which Europeans knew the Emperor of Ethiopia. The Ethiopians, though, had never called their emperor that. When ambassadors from Emperor Zara Yaqob attended the Council of Florence in 1441, they were confused when council prelates insisted on referring to their monarch as Prester John. They tried to <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> nowhere in Zara Yaqob's list of regnal names did that title occur. However, their admonitions did little to stop Europeans from calling the King of Ethiopia Prester John. Some writers who used the title did understand it was not an indigenous honorific; for instance Jordanus seems to use it simply because his readers would have been familiar with it, not because he thought it authentic.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Manheim recovers {{long enough}} to <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> he was doing {{experiments}} involving time, gravity, and funnels to other universes, and suspects his last experiment {{is running out of}} control. Manheim explains that he is trapped between two dimensions and Data determines that the experiment must be shut down during a time fluctuation or else it will simply grow larger. Manheim provides the crew with the correct coordinates to beam down to avoid the security fields. Picard admits to Jenice that he worried about losing her again after he left her in Paris, and vows to correct Dr. Manheim's experiment.|$|E

50|$|The Young Pioneers Constitution <b>explains</b> <b>that</b> {{the scarf}} {{corresponds}} to the missing triangle on the Pioneer Company flag. The Constitution also <b>explains</b> <b>that</b> the red of the scarf comes from the blood sacrificed by martyrs of the Revolution, and that all members should therefore wear the scarf with reverence.|$|R
50|$|Completing his story, Hanshirō <b>explains</b> <b>that</b> his sole {{desire is}} to join Motome, Miho, and Kingo {{in the next}} world. He <b>explains,</b> however, <b>that</b> they {{have every right to}} ask whether justice has been exacted for their deaths. Therefore, Hanshiro asks Saito if he has any {{statement}} of regret to convey to Motome, Miho, and Kingo. He <b>explains</b> <b>that,</b> if Saito does so, he will die without saying another word.|$|R
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) lies {{unconscious}} {{in the sea}} after wrecking his raft. He {{is taken}} aboard a passenger ship, the Queen Anne, by its British crew members. When he is sent to meet the captain, Mulder tries to <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> the Queen Anne vanished in the Bermuda Triangle in 1939, and claims that it has reappeared in 1998. The crew dismisses Mulder's story and suspect he is a Nazi spy. At that moment, the Queen Anne is boarded by SS troops {{under the control of}} a Oberführer resembling The Smoking Man (William B. Davis), who sets the ship's course for Nazi Germany. The crew of the Queen Anne lock Mulder in the captain's quarters, where he listens to a radio broadcast announcing the start of World War II. Mulder realizes that the Queen Anne did not travel to 1998: he has traveled back to 1939.|$|E
5|$|Having bonded with Percy and valuing their relationship, Carl accepts Percy's {{enthusiastic}} {{offer to}} help out on weekends and holidays when the two are back in Los Angeles. Ramsey visits the truck to <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> he wrote the bad review as he felt Carl's skills did not suit a restaurant which had been serving the same menu for years. He leaves with an offer to bankroll a new restaurant. In a flash-forward set six months later, the new restaurant is successful and closed for a private event: Carl and Inez's remarriage ceremony.|$|E
5|$|In London, Bond learns his {{objective}} is determining how Goldfinger smuggles gold internationally. The {{chancellor of the}} exchequer and M <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> gold prices vary across the world, allowing one to profit by selling bullion internationally. Bond arranges to meet Goldfinger socially at his country club in Kent, and wins a high-stakes golf game against him with a recovered Nazi gold bar at stake. Bond follows him to Switzerland, where Tilly, Jill's sister, makes an unsuccessful attempt at revenge by firing a rifle at Goldfinger.|$|E

50|$|After this meeting, the Japanese Cabinet {{replied with}} letters <b>explaining</b> <b>that</b> the American draft was too direct and {{contained}} ideas {{that would not}} work in Japan. Whitney reiterated the drafts benefits and <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> SCAP was prepared to present its draft to the Japanese people directly should the Cabinet refuse it.|$|R
50|$|Note: The author <b>explains</b> <b>that</b> in the series, {{none of the}} {{characters}} are called by their real names, due to the reader's possibly {{of being part of}} the Midnight Sun and finding out too much information, and <b>explains</b> <b>that</b> each character has a pseudonym in place of their real name.|$|R
5|$|In San Antonio de Béxar, Ugartechea asked Dr. Launcelot Smither, a Gonzales {{resident}} in town on personal business, to help Castañeda convince the settlers to follow orders. When Smither arrived on October 1, {{he met with}} militia captain Mathew Caldwell to <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> the soldiers meant no harm if the settlers would peacefully relinquish the cannon. Caldwell instructed Smither to bring Castañeda to the town the following morning to discuss the matter. At roughly the same time, Moore called a war council, which quickly voted to initiate a fight. It is unclear whether the war council was aware that Caldwell had promised Castañeda safe passage to Gonzales the next morning.|$|E
5|$|Jewish legend {{records that}} Samson's {{shoulders}} were sixty cubits broad. (Many Talmudic commentaries, however, <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> {{this is not}} to be taken literally, for a person that size could not live normally in society. Rather, it means that he had the ability to carry a burden 60 cubits wide (approximately 30 meters) on his shoulders). He was lame in both feet but, when the spirit of God came upon him, he could step with one stride from Zorah to Eshtaol, while the hairs of his head arose and clashed against one another so that they could be heard for a like distance. Samson was said to be so strong that he could uplift two mountains and rub them together like two s of earth, yet his superhuman strength, like Goliath's, brought woe upon its possessor.|$|E
5|$|Later, when Mark {{goes to the}} Bahamas on a {{supposed}} business trip, Kate decides to follow him there and expose him. She finds Carly and Amber at the airport, who <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> Mark has been using Kate {{as the owner of}} the companies he defrauded from, which would—were his fraud to be discovered—result in her going to prison. Kate also finds out that Mark has been seeing yet another woman: someone he has met on this trip. This, and the possibility of him facing prison, motivates her to take action with the help of Carly's legal expertise.|$|E

5|$|On {{their way}} to King's Landing, the king's entourage has stopped to rest at an inn. While the {{recently}} promised Prince Joffrey and Sansa Stark are walking along the river, they run into Arya sparring with sticks with her friend, a butcher's boy named Mycah. Taunting the boy, Joffrey draws his sword and demands a duel, under pretext of punishing him for accidentally hitting Arya, {{a member of the}} nobility. Mycah and Arya desperately <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> she asked him to spar with her so she could practice. As Joffrey savors the butcher boy's pain and fear, Arya hits Joffrey while her friend flees. Enraged, Joffrey turns on Arya and is about to strike her with his sword when her direwolf Nymeria bites his wrist. Arya seizes his sword and throws it into the river before running into the forest, where she drives away Nymeria and hides until dark.|$|E
5|$|Retrograde {{signaling}} is {{a hypothesis}} {{that attempts to}} <b>explain</b> <b>that,</b> while LTP is induced and expressed postsynaptically, some evidence {{suggests that it is}} expressed presynaptically as well. The hypothesis gets its name because normal synaptic transmission is directional and proceeds from the presynaptic to the postsynaptic cell. For induction to occur postsynaptically and be partially expressed presynaptically, a message must travel from the postsynaptic cell to the presynaptic cell in a retrograde (reverse) direction. Once there, the message presumably initiates a cascade of events that leads to a presynaptic component of expression, such as the increased probability of neurotransmitter vesicle release.|$|E
5|$|That night, Jack tells {{everyone}} that he trusts Juliet {{and that should}} be enough, but Sayid disagrees. Jack continues to <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> John Locke blew up the submarine that was to take him home. Claire suddenly collapses with blood gushing from her face. Juliet takes Jack and Kate aside and tells them she knows what's wrong with Claire because she did it to her. At the camp, Juliet explains that Claire's immune system has turned against her due to a latent reaction to medication in her bloodstream. The medication was designed by Juliet to keep Claire alive during her pregnancy. She was brought to the island to find out why women couldn't have children. The mother's body treats the pregnancy as a foreign invader and the immune system attacks; every pregnant woman on the island has died. Claire was the first to survive even though she showed some of the symptoms.|$|E
