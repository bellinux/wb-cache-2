40|$|Work {{is devoted}} to {{development}} of technological process of simultaneous separate modifying of liquid cast iron in reactionary cameras of gating system of a casting mold for production of castings with a firm wear-resistant superficial working layer and a viscous shockproof basis. On {{the basis of the}} conducted theoretical and pilot researches effective additives for sferoidyzation and karbidostabilization modifying of cast iron in a casting mold on the basis of modifiers which provide the guaranteed receiving set structure and properties of cast iron in casting are chosen. The most perspective constructive and technological option of production of two-layer castings as separate modifying of cast iron in a casting mold is chosen. The method of computer modeling, and also natural experiments investigated features of new constructive and technological option of production of two-layer castings from white wear-resistant and shockproof high-strength iron by separate karbidostabilization and sferoidyzation modifying of initial cast iron of the eutectic structure in a casting mold. Influence of the key technological parameters of process is established: temperatures of filling of source cast iron, thickness of a <b>dividing</b> <b>steel</b> partition on process of receiving different structure and properties of two-layer castings. Technological processes of receiving two-layer industrial castings with a firm wear-resistant working surface from white cast iron and a viscous plastic basis from high-strength cast iron with spherical graphite, and also technological process of receiving castings of high-strength cast iron with spherical graphite are developed and tested in laboratory and working conditions. ?????? ????????? ?????????? ?????? ??????? ????????? ??????????? ??????? ? ????? ????? ?? ???????? ?????????????? ?????? ?????? ? ? ?????? ?? ????? ?? ?????????????? ?????? ? ?????????? ????????. ???????? ?????? ??????? ??????????? ? ???????? ?????? ? ????? ???? ? ?????????? ??? ??? ?????????? ??????? ????? ? ?????????? ??????? ?? ??? ??????, ??????? ?????????????? ? ??????????? ??????? ??????? ?? ??????????????? ?????????? ?????????????? ? ??????????????? ?????????? ????????? ? ???????? ?????????? ??????????????. ????????? ?????????????? ????????? ????????? ????????????? ???????, ?????? ? ?????????? ?????????????-??????????????? ???????, ??????? ??????????????? ?????????? ????????? ?????? ?????????????? ??????? ?? ??? ?????? ? ??????????????? ???????????????? ? ?????????? ??????? ?????? ?? ??? ????????????????? ?????????????, ??? ????????? ? ????? ??????? ???????? ?????????????? ?????? ??????, ? ?????? ???????????????? ?????????????, ??? ????????? ? ?????? ????? ??????? ?????????????? ?????? ? ?????????? ????????. ?? ????????? ??????????? ????????????? ? ????????????????? ???????????? ??????? ??????????? ??????? ??? ????????????????? ? ?????????????????? ??????????????? ?????? ? ???????? ????? ?? ?????? ?????????????, ??????? ???????????? ??????????????? ????????? ???????? ????????? ? ??????? ?????? ? ???????. ??????? ????????????? ?????????????, ? ????? ????????? ?????????????? ??????????? ??????????? ?????? ?????????????-???????????????? ???????? ???????????? ??????????? ???????. ??????????? ??????? ??????????????? ?????????? ???????? ? ??????????? ??????? ????????? ??????, ??????? ?????????????? ???????? ??????????? ?? ??????? ????????? ?????? ????????? ? ??????? ??????????? ??????? ? ????????? ?? ??????. ?????????? ?????????????? ???????????? ?????????????? ??????????? ???? ??????????? ??????? ?? ??????????? ??????????????? ??????????. ??????????? ? ?????????? ? ???????????? ? ???????????????? ???????? ??????????????? ???????? ????????? ??????????? ???????????? ??????? ???????? ?????????? ????????? ? ????? ? ??????? ????????????? ??????? ????? ?? ?????? ?????? ? ?????? ?????????? ?????? ?? ?????????????? ?????? ? ?????????? ????????, ? ????? ??????????????? ??????? ????????? ???????????? ??????? ????????? ?? ?????????????? ?????? ? ?????????? ???????? ????? ?? 50. ????????????? ???????????? ??????????? ???????? ??????? ???????????? ????? ???????? ? 1, 2 ???? ???? ??????????? ?????????? ???????, ??????????????? ?? ????? 110 ? 13. ?????? ???????????? ??????? ?????????, ???????????????? ???????? ????????? ????????????? ?? ?????????? ???????????????? ????????????????? ??????????????? ?? ?????? ????? ?? 50 ? ??? ???? ????????? ??????? ?????? ??????????? ????????????, ????????????????? ???????? ????????? ?? ?????? ?????? ????? ?? 20...|$|E

6000|$|The word elf, {{which seems}} to have been the {{original}} name of the beings, afterwards denominated fairies, is of Gothic origin, and probably signified, simply, a spirit of a lower order. Thus, the Saxons had not only dun-elfen, berg-elfen, and munt-elfen, spirits of the downs, hills, and mountains; but also feld-elfen, wudu-elfen, sae-elfen, and water-elfen; spirits of the fields, of the woods, of the sea, and of the waters. In low German, the same latitude of expression occurs; for night hags are termed aluinnen, and aluen, which is sometimes Latinized eluoe. But the prototype of the English elf, is to be sought chiefly in the berg-elfen, or duergar, of the Scandinavians. From the most early of the Icelandic Sagas, {{as well as from the}} Edda itself, we learn the belief of the northern nations in a race of dwarfish spirits, inhabiting the rocky mountains, and approaching, in some respects, to the human nature. Their attributes, amongst which we recognize the features of the modern Fairy, were, supernatural wisdom and prescience, and skill in the mechanical arts, especially in the fabrication of arms. They are farther described, as capricious, vindictive, and easily irritated. The story of the elfin sword, Tyrfing, may be the most pleasing illustration of this position. Suafurlami, a Scandinavian monarch, returning from hunting, bewildered himself among the mountains. About sun-set, he beheld a large rock, and two dwarfs, sitting before the mouth of a cavern. The king drew his sword, and intercepted their retreat, by springing betwixt them and their recess, and imposed upon them the following condition of safety:--that they should make for him a faulchion, with a baldric and scabbard of pure gold, and a blade, which should divide stones and iron as a garment, and which should render the wielder ever victorious in battle. The elves complied with the requisition, and Suafurlami pursued his way home. Returning at the time appointed, the dwarfs delivered to him the famous sword Tyrfing; then, standing in the entrance of their cavern, spoke thus: [...] "This sword, O king, shall [...] "destroy a man every time it is brandished; but it shall [...] "perform three atrocious deeds, and it shall be thy bane." [...] The king rushed forward with the charmed sword, and buried both its edges in the rock; but the dwarfs escaped into their recesses.[A] This enchanted sword emitted rays like the sun, dazzling all against whom it was brandished; it <b>divided</b> <b>steel</b> like water, and was never unsheathed without slaying a man--Hervarar Saga, p. 9. Similar to this was the enchanted sword, Skoffhung, which was taken by a pirate out of the tomb of a Norwegian monarch. Many such tales are narrated in the Sagas; but the most distinct account of the -duergar, or elves, and their attributes, is to be found in a preface of Torfaeus to the history of Hrolf Kraka, who cites a dissertation by Einar Gudmund, a learned native of Iceland. [...] "I am firmly of opinion," [...] says the Icelander, [...] "that these beings are creatures of God, consisting, like human beings, of a body and rational soul; that they are of different sexes, and capable of producing children, and subject to all human affections, as sleeping and waking, laughing and crying, poverty and wealth; and that they possess cattle, and other effects, and are obnoxious to death, like other mortals." [...] He proceeds to state, that the females of this race are capable of procreating with mankind; and gives an account of one who bore a child to an inhabitant of Iceland, for whom she claimed the privilege of baptism; depositing the infant, for that purpose, at the gate of the church-yard, together with a goblet of gold, as an offering.--Historia Hrolfi Krakae, a TORFAEO.|$|R
50|$|A new organ was {{supplied}} to the abbey in 1895 by Norman and Beard of Norwich. It had 52 stops spread over four manuals and pedals, and stood <b>divided</b> on two <b>steel</b> beams in the North and South crossing arches, with the console {{standing on the}} floor next to the north-west pier of the crossing. New cases were to be provided to designs by Brian Oliver of Bath, but were never executed. Norman & Beard re-erected it in a new case designed by Sir Thomas Jackson in the North Transept in 1914, with the addition of two stops to the Pedal.It was again rebuilt by them in 1930, and then by Hill, Norman and Beard in 1948, which brought the number of stops to 58. In 1972 this was increased to a total of 65 speaking stops. The Positive division, with its separate case behind the console, was installed at the same time. Problems caused by the tonal scheme's lack of coherence - the 1895 pipework contrasting sharply with that of 1972 - and with reliability, caused by the wide variety of different types of key actions, all difficult to access, led to the decision to have the instrument rebuilt yet again.|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} process and {{property}} of hot-rolled stainless steel/carbon steel cladding bar, a rational pass system is designed for rolling and the bonding strength between the stainless steel cladding and carbon steel core was investigated by using shearing test and bending test. Then, the bonding interface, element diffusion and shearing fracture surface were analyzed by applying optical microscope, EDS and SEM. The {{results show that the}} thickness distribution of stainless steel shell is homogeneous; the metallurgical bonding between the two metals is formed after the third pass rolling and the shearing strength of the interface is more than 307 MPa. At the same time, the bending property of the bar displays well. The interface region is clearly <b>divided</b> into stainless <b>steel</b> zone, transition zone and carbon steel zone. Element diffusion occurs at the interface that the Fe of carbon steel diffuses into stainless steel and the Cr, Ni, Mn of stainless steel diffuse into carbon steel. It makes the formation of the transition zone with 20 μm in width in carbon steel and the total width of diffusion zone is 30 μm. Shearing strength of the interface after the sixth pass rolling is higher than the carbon steel substrate and the shearing fracture occurs in the carbon steel...|$|R
60|$|After {{the same}} manner that the ideas of these {{original}} qualities are produced in us, we may conceive that the ideas of SECONDARY qualities are also produced, viz. by the operation of insensible particles on our senses. For, it being manifest that there are bodies and good store of bodies, each whereof are so small, that we cannot by any of our senses discover either their bulk, figure, or motion,--as {{is evident in the}} particles of the air and water, and others extremely smaller than those; perhaps as much smaller than the particles of air and water, as the particles of air and water are smaller than peas or hail-stones;--let us suppose at present that, the different motions and figures, bulk and number, of such particles, affecting the several organs of our senses, produce: in us those different sensations which we have from the colours and smells of bodies; v.g. that a violet, by the impulse of such insensible particles of matter, of peculiar figures and bulks, and in different degrees and modifications of their motions, causes the ideas of the blue colour, and sweet scent of that flower to be produced in our minds.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{stainless}} steel has been produced {{for more than}} a hundred years, exposure-related mortality data for production workers are limited. AIMS: To describe cause-specific mortality in Finnish ferrochromium and {{stainless steel}} workers. METHODS: We studied Finnish stainless steel production chain workers employed between 1967 and 2004, from chromite mining to cold rolling of stainless <b>steel,</b> <b>divided</b> into sub-cohorts by production units with specific exposure patterns. We obtained causes of death for the years 1971 - 2012 from Statistics Finland. We calculated standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) as ratios of observed and expected numbers of deaths based on population mortality rates of the same region. RESULTS: Among 8088 workers studied, overall mortality was significantly decreased (SMR 0. 77; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 70 - 0. 84), largely due to low mortality from diseases of the circulatory system (SMR 0. 71; 95 % CI 0. 61 - 0. 81). In chromite mine, stainless steel melting shop and metallurgical laboratory workers, the SMR for circulatory disease was below 0. 4 (SMR 0. 33; 95 % CI 0. 07 - 0. 95, SMR 0. 22; 95 % CI 0. 05 - 0. 65 and SMR 0. 16; 95 % CI 0. 00 - 0. 90, respectively). Mortality from accidents (SMR 0. 84; 95 % CI 0. 67 - 1. 04) and suicides (SMR 0. 72; 95 % CI 0. 56 - 0. 91) was also lower than in the reference population. CONCLUSIONS: Working in the Finnish ferrochromium and stainless steel industry appears not to be associated with increased mortality...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study for {{transient temperature response}} of low aspect ratio packed beds at high Reynolds numbers for a free stream with varying inlet temperature is presented. The packed bed {{is used as a}} compact heat exchanger along with a solid propellant gas-generator, to generate room temperature gases for use in applications such as control actuation and air bottle pressurization. Packed beds of lengths similar to 200 mm and 300 mm were characterized for packing diameter based Reynolds numbers, Re-d ranging from 0. 6 x 10 (4) to 8. 5 x 10 (4). The solid packing used in the bed consisted of circle divide 9. 5 mm and circle <b>divide</b> 5 mm <b>steel</b> spheres with suitable arrangements to eliminate flow entrance and exit effects. The ratios of packed bed diameter to packing diameter for 9. 5 mm and 5 mm sphere packing were similar to 9. 5 and 18 respectively, with the average packed bed porosities around 0. 4. Gas temperatures were measured at the entry, exit and at three axial locations along centre-line in the packed beds. The solid packing temperature was measured at three axial locations in the packed bed. An average Nusselt number correlation of the form Nu(d) = 3. 91 Re(d) (05) for Re-d range of 10 (4) is proposed. For engineering applications of packed beds such as pebble bed heaters, thermal storage systems, and compact heat exchangers a simple procedure is suggested for calculating unsteady gas temperature at packed bed exit for packing Biot number Bi-d < 0. 1.

5000|$|At {{the end of}} 2000, Mattel {{took the}} {{decision}} to <b>divide</b> the Max <b>Steel</b> figures into different sub lines. All sport related toys, for example, would go to [...] "Extreme Sports Adventure," [...] while others would go into [...] "Urban Siege," [...] "Snake Island," [...] etc. Vitriol, a new villain, was produced as the main villain in the sub line Urban Siege, usign the same molds used to produce Psycho. Vitriol and Psycho wear the same pants, albeit different colors. The only notorious difference is, while Psycho's right arm is a bionic construction which can {{be transformed into a}} claw/laser, Vitriol's arms were green, with light up features. By an unfortunate coincidence, after the September 11, 2001 attacks, all Urban Siege action figures were immediately recalled because they contained [...] "Secret Mission" [...] Cards. Each card contained clues and plots about fictional terrorists attacks on American soil. Children were supposed to use the cards to be [...] "informed of their next mission and stop the terrorists" [...] before they could demolish a building, spread a deadly virus or detonate a nuke bomb, among other tasks. Vitriol and least a couple of cards included the text: [...] "Vitriol is on top of the World Trade Center ready to blast the city with his deadly energy waves! Your Mission: Stop Vitriol before he destroys New York City!". Once any mention of terrorism in New York was eliminated, the toys returned to the shelves, but as part of the main line this time. The Urban Siege series which focused on counter terrorism ended immediately after the recall. Other figures of different lines retained their respective mission cards. Rumors say the real reason of this act of empathy were the low popularity and poor sales of Vitriol, specially because it is the only Max Steel action figure never produced again after its initial release.|$|R
