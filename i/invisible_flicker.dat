Dyslexics, like controls, show apparent duration compression after 20 Hz flicker and show normal shifts in apparent temporal frequency after adaptation. However a subgroup of the test group, scoring low on both a test of phonological skill (spoonerisms) and a test of literacy (NART), show an apparent temporal expansion after 5 Hz flicker adaptation, a finding not previously seen in controls. Recent studies have linked genes conferring susceptibility to a cluster of language and sensory deficits to anomalous neural migration, providing a tentative biological basis for dyslexia. However it has proved difficult to establish a clear link between sensory deficits and impaired reading. The results presented here point to an abnormal adaptation response within the early precortical stages of the magnocellular pathway, occurring in tandem with a deficit in word-level cognitive processing, providing psychophysical evidence for anomalous cortico-thalamic circuits in dyslexia...|$|E
40|$|Human {{ability to}} resolve {{temporal}} variation, or flicker, in the luminance (brightness) or chromaticity (color) {{of an image}} declines with increasing frequency and is limited, within the central visual field, to a critical flicker frequency of â‰ˆ 50 and 25 Hz, respectively. Much remains unknown about the neural filtering that underlies this frequency-dependent attenuation of flicker sensitivity, most notably the number of filtering stages involved and their neural loci. Here we use the process of flicker adaptation, by which an observer's flicker sensitivity is attenuated after prolonged exposure to flickering lights, as a functional landmark. We show that flicker adaptation is more sensitive to high temporal frequencies than is conscious perception and that prolonged exposure to <b>invisible</b> <b>flicker</b> of either luminance or chromaticity, at frequencies above the respective critical flicker frequency, can compromise our visual sensitivity. This suggests that multiple filtering stages, distributed across retinal and cortical loci that straddle the locus for flicker adaptation, {{are involved in the}} neural filtering of high temporal frequencies by the human visual system...|$|E
40|$|In {{the modern}} era, a vast {{quantities}} of digital information {{is available in the}} form of audio, image, video, and other sensor recordings. These recordings may contain metadata describing important information such as the time and the location of recording. As the stored information can be easily modified using readily available digital editing software, determining the authenticity of a recording has utmost importance, especially for critical applications such as law enforcement, journalism, and national and business intelligence. In this dissertation, we study novel environmental signatures induced by power networks, which are known as Electrical Network Frequency (ENF) signals and become embedded in multimedia data at the time of recording. ENF fluctuates slightly over time from its nominal value of 50 Hz/ 60 Hz. The major trend of fluctuations in the ENF remains consistent across the entire power grid, including when measured at physically distant geographical locations. We investigate the use of ENF signals for a variety of applications such as estimation/verification of time and location of a recording's creation, and develop a theoretical foundation to support ENF based forensic analysis. In {{the first part of the}} dissertation, the presence of ENF signals in visual recordings captured in electric powered lighting environments is demonstrated. The source of ENF signals in visual recordings is shown to be the <b>invisible</b> <b>flickering</b> of indoor lighting sources such as fluorescent and incandescent lamps. The techniques to extract ENF signals from recordings demonstrate that a high correlation is observed between the ENF fluctuations obtained from indoor lighting and that from the power mains supply recorded at the same time. Applications of the ENF signal analysis to tampering detection of surveillance video recordings, and forensic binding of the audio and visual track of a video are also discussed. In the following part, an analytical model is developed to gain an understanding of the behavior of ENF signals. It is demonstrated that ENF signals can be modeled using a time-varying autoregressive process. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated for a timestamp verification application. Based on this model, an improved algorithm for ENF matching between a reference signal and a query signal is provided. It is shown that the proposed approach provides an improved matching performance as compared to the case when matching is performed directly on ENF signals. Another application of the proposed model in learning the power grid characteristics is also explicated. These characteristics are learnt by using the modeling parameters as features to train a classifier to determine the creation location of a recording among candidate grid-regions. The last part of the dissertation demonstrates that differences exist between ENF signals recorded in the same grid-region at the same time. These differences can be extracted using a suitable filter mechanism and follow a relationship with the distance between different locations. Based on this observation, two localization protocols are developed to identify the location of a recording within the same grid-region, using ENF signals captured at anchor locations. Localization accuracy of the proposed protocols are then compared. Challenges in using the proposed technique to estimate the creation location of multimedia recordings within the same grid, along with efficient and resilient trilateration strategies in the presence of outliers and malicious anchors, are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|High-frequency {{oscillations}} {{emerged as}} a neural code for both positive affect and fluent attentional processing from evolutionary simulations with artificial neural networks. Visual 50 Hz flicker, which entrains neural oscillations in the gamma band, {{has been shown to}} foster attentional switching, but can it also elicit positive affect? A three-faces display (2 -female/ 1 -male or 2 -male/ 1 -female) was preceded by a 50, 25, or 0 Hz flicker on the position of the odd-one-out (i. e., the target). Participants decided on the gender (Block 1) or on the subjective valence (Block 2) of this neutral target in an approach-avoidance task, which served as an implicit affective measure. Only the detection of 25 Hz flicker, but not of 50 Hz flicker, was above chance (Block 3). Faces primed by <b>invisible</b> 50 Hz <b>flicker</b> were explicitly evaluated more positively than with 25 Hz or 0 Hz. This gamma flicker also facilitated approach reactions, and inhibited avoidance reactions relative to 25 Hz and 0 Hz flicker in Blocks 1 and 2. Attentional switching was, moreover, enhanced by the 50 Hz flicker. According to the Affect-Gamma hypothesis, also in biological neural networks, high-frequency gamma oscillations may code for positive affect...|$|R
