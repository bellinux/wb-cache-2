Current ground data systems provide for telemetry, command, and uplink and downlink processing capabilities. The new millennium project (NMP) technology testbed for 21 st century NASA missions is discussed. The program demonstrates spacecraft and ground system technologies.

40|$|We {{introduce}} relational grams (r-grams). They upgrade n-grams for modeling relational {{sequences of}} atoms. As n-grams, r-grams {{are based on}} smoothed n-th order Markov chains. Smoothed distributions {{can be obtained by}} decreasing the order of the Markov chain as well as by relational generalization of the r-gram. To avoid sampling object identifiers in sequences, r-grams are generative models at the level of variablized sequences with local object identity constraints. These sequences define equivalence classes of <b>ground</b> <b>sequences,</b> in which elements are identical up to local identifier renaming. The proposed technique is evaluated in several domains, including mobile phone communication logs, Unix shell user modeling, and protein fold prediction based on secondary protein structure. ...|$|R

40|$|In conversation, {{people have}} to deal with {{problems}} of speaking, hearing, and understanding. We report on a cross-linguistic investigation of the conversational structure of other-initiated repair (also known as collaborative repair, feedback, requests for clarification, or <b>grounding</b> <b>sequences).</b> We take stock of formats for initiating repair across languages (comparable to English huh?, who?, y’mean X?, etc.) and find that different languages make available a wide but remarkably similar range of linguistic resources for this function. We exploit the patterned variation as evidence for several underlying concerns addressed by repair initiation: characterising trouble, managing responsibility, and handling knowledge. The concerns do not always point in the same direction and thus provide participants in interaction with alternative principles for selecting one format over possible others. By comparing conversational structures across languages, this paper contributes to pragmatic typology: the typology of systems of language use and the principles that shape the...|$|R
40|$|Much of {{the initial}} focus for {{spacecraft}} autonomy has been on developing new software and systems concepts to automate engineering functions of the spacecraft: guidance, navigation and control, fault protection, and resource management, However, the ultimate objectives of NASA missions are science objectives, which implies {{that we need a}} new framework for perfcmrning science data evaluation and observation planning autonomously onboard spacecraft. We will outline some of the opportunities presented by onboard science processing for transforming the way that scientific data are collected and used by space platforms. The future NASA mission set will feature smaller and more numerous spacecraft in an environment of highly constrained uplink and downlink communications, requiring substantial onboard computation to achieve mission goals. The proposed paradigm will enable mission activities to be directed by scientists without the assistance of a <b>ground</b> <b>sequencing</b> team, robust capture and redirection in making discoveries at the target body, accommodation of the realities of limited communication links, and the return of quality science products from missions. ...|$|R

5000|$|Principal filming {{took place}} from April 16, 1949 to July 1949, {{but the final}} {{production}} was held back from release until 1950. In order to realistically depict the flight testing, permission was obtained to film at various United States Air Force bases including Muroc Army Air Field where experimental testing took place, as well as location shooting occurring at the San Fernando Valley Airport (now Van Nuys Airport). [...] A realistic full-scale JA-3/JA-4 model created by Paul Mantz, the aerial sequence director, was built for $15,000. The origins of the film model stemmed from a derelict Bell P-39 Airacobra fuselage that had been reworked by Vince Johnson, an expert [...] "lofter". The Warner Bros contract called for completion of a realistic (if futuristic) fighter able to taxi and deploy parachutes. Besides the full-scale model used {{for most of the}} <b>ground</b> <b>sequences,</b> a number of scale models were built. Recently, a Willis JA-3 fibreglass miniature used in the production, measuring 80 in. long and a wingspan of 59 in., was auctioned for $1,300 USD.|$|R

40|$|Ferroresonance is {{a complex}} {{nonlinear}} electrical phenomenon that can cause dielectric and thermal problems for electrical equipment. Electrical systems with ferroresonant behavior are nonlinear dynamical systems. The ferroresonance phenomenon may take place when the core of an inductive device becomes saturated, and its current flux characteristic becomes nonlinear. While {{in the case of}} a linear resonant circuit the resonance frequency is well defined, {{in the case of a}} nonlinear circuit, the oscillations may exist at various frequencies, depending on many factors of the particular case. In this paper, ferroresonance phenomenon and its mitigation techniques in 33 kV/ 110 V voltage transformers (VT) were studied using ATP-EMTP simulation. Initial investigations were carried out for the VT failures occurred at one substation in Malaysia. Physical and burn characteristics of the failed VTs were studied. Simulation results show that ferroresonance cannot be proven to have occurred at the VT due to switching operations since one precondition, namely the critical capacitance, could not have been satisfied. However, in the event of a ferroresonance occurring, several mitigation techniques such as using load resistors, proper <b>grounding</b> <b>sequence,</b> reconfiguration of VT connection, and overcurrent and overvoltage protection can be implemented...|$|R

We use a two-step transformation on the input expressions to enforce termination after O(n) steps {{in the size of}} the input. We apply the completion procedure for developing rule-based declarative and dynamic algorithms for detecting embeddings in <b>ground</b> rewrite <b>sequences.</b> These results are interesting for the constraint-based analysis of state transition systems, for partial evaluation and for the reachability and termination analysis of ground term rewrite systems...|$|R

40|$|The elegant {{theory of}} {{definite}} logic programs has the following properties [5]: (1) P, {{read as a}} conjunction of implications in first order logic, has a least Herbrand model MP which is the intersection of all Herbrand models. (2) Under the same reading of P, the ground atoms that are logic consequences of P coincide with MP. (3) MP coincides with the least fixpoint of the TP operator. Moreover, MP also coincides with the unique two-valued well-founded model of the program read as an inductive definition [2]. 2 Definite sequence logic programs with gaps Definite sequence logic programs. One can easily argue that the above theory is preserved when atoms are replaced by finite sequences of atoms. Doing so, the Herbrand base becomes the set of all finite <b>ground</b> <b>sequences</b> and a Herbrand interpretation is a subset of it. The only difference is that, in the TP operator and in the SLD procedure, unification is between sequences instead of atoms 1. However, this does not change anything substantial to unification, {{there is still a}} unique most general unifier. Let us fix a notation for sequences: We denote sequences as a juxtaposition of atoms and the empty sequence as ɛ; we use “. ” to denote the concatenation of two sequences, e. g. p(a) q(a, X). r(X, b) denotes the sequence p(a) q(a, X) r(X, b).

40|$|A {{fundamental}} goal {{of genetics}} and functional genomics {{is to identify}} and mutate every gene in model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster. The Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (BDGP) gene disruption project generates single P-element insertion strains that each mutate unique genomic open reading frames. Such strains strongly facilitate further genetic and molecular studies of the disrupted loci, but it has remained unclear if P elements {{can be used to}} mutate all Drosophila genes. We now report that the primary collection has grown to contain 1045 strains that disrupt more than 25 % of the estimated 3600 Drosophila genes that are essential for adult viability. Of these P insertions, 67 % have been verified by genetic tests to cause the associated recessive mutant phenotypes, and the validity of most of the remaining lines is predicted on statistical <b>grounds.</b> <b>Sequences</b> flanking > 920 insertions have been determined to exactly position them in the genome and to identify 376 potentially affected transcripts from collections of EST sequences. Strains in the BDGP collection are available from the Bloomington Stock Center and have already assisted the research community in characterizing > 250 Drosophila genes. The likely identity of 131 additional genes in the collection is reported here. Our results show that Drosophila genes have a wide range of sensitivity to inactivation by P elements, and provide a rationale for greatly expanding the BDGP primary collection based entirely on insertion site sequencing. We predict that this approach can bring > 85 % of all Drosophila open reading frames under experimental control...|$|R
