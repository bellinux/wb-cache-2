5|$|Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote a {{concurrence}} that {{agreed with}} the <b>finding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> state court's decision was reasonable. However, O'Connor held {{that there could be}} cases in which age would be relevant to custody analysis. This would be affirmed by the Court in 2011 in J.D.B. v. North Carolina.|$|E

50|$|In January 2008, Crutzen {{published}} <b>findings</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{release of}} nitrous oxide (N2O) {{emissions in the}} production of biofuels means that they contribute more to global warming than the fossil fuels they replace.|$|R
5|$|In late 2008 {{a company}} from the 1st Commando Regiment {{became the first}} formed Army Reserve unit to see combat since World War II when it was {{deployed}} to Afghanistan {{as part of the}} Australian Special Operations Task Group. The initial deployment proved problematic however, with a subsequent inquiry <b>finding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> company had received less support for its pre-deployment preparations than was typical for regular units and that its training was inadequate. The 1st Commando Regiment contributed forces to several other Special Operations Task Group rotations.|$|E
5|$|Many {{courts have}} {{declined}} to assess the religious status of Scientology, <b>finding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> question was irrelevant to deciding the case at hand. The Federal Administrative Court for example ruled in 1997 that the question whether or not Scientology was a religion was irrelevant, and that its legal status should be judged by its business activities. The German government does not consider the Church of Scientology to be a religious or worldview community and asserts that Scientology is a profit-making enterprise, rather than a religion.|$|E
5|$|This success led Barnes to {{consider}} cricket {{as a potential}} career. However, his mother and stepfather {{were concerned about the}} likelihood of cricket providing him with a living. In response, Barnes took a job with a garage in Mosman but after <b>finding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> necessary travel interfered too much with playing cricket, he found alternative employment, demonstrating motorbikes in the city.|$|E

50|$|The {{historical}} {{origins of}} this route are uncertain. It is believed, based on diverse archaeological <b>findings,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> route {{was used for}} commercial purposes involving tin. Tin was present in many regions of the Iberian Peninsula including Tartessos.|$|R
5|$|With Craig Kundrot, Richards {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} high pressure (1000 atmospheres) on protein structure, using hen-egg lysozyme crystals, <b>finding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> structure was robust to such pressures apart from a quite modest compaction in size. In the 1990s, Richards and collaborators used a combination of theory and experiment to investigate how the well-packed interior of proteins can nevertheless accommodate mutations.|$|E
5|$|A study {{published}} in the Neuropsychopharmacology journal in 2013 revealed the <b>finding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> flavour of beer alone could provoke dopamine activity in the brain of the male participants, who wanted to drink more as a result. The 49 men in the study were subject to positron emission tomography scans, while a computer-controlled device sprayed minute amounts of beer, water and a sports drink onto their tongues. Compared with the taste of the sports drink, the taste of beer significantly increased the participants desire to drink. Test results indicated that the flavour of the beer triggered a dopamine release, even though alcohol content in the spray was insufficient for the purpose of becoming intoxicated.|$|E
5|$|After being released, JJ terminates his {{contract}} with Dhingra's company, embarks on a country-wide tour for his concerts and finally morphs fully into 'Jordan' - the true rockstar, which he {{had always wanted to}} be. He turns into a bitter, arrogant, and lonely man after <b>finding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fame does not fill the void in his life. Khatana is now his manager, but fails to control him, and Jordan is constantly involved in fights with the media and fans. Inspite of all this, he remains a highly popular artist.|$|E

5|$|As {{the summer}} of 1985 continued, sales of the C5 {{remained}} far below Sinclair's predictions; only 8,000 had been sold by July. In {{the middle of that}} month, the Advertising Standards Authority ordered Sinclair to amend or withdraw its advertisements for the C5 after <b>finding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> company's claims about the safety and speed of the C5 either could not be proved or were not justified. Retailers attempted to deal with unsold stocks of C5s by drastically cutting the vehicle's price. Comet first reduced the price to £259.90 {{but by the end of}} the year was selling C5s with a complete set of accessories for only £139.99, 65% less than the initial price.|$|E
5|$|Brentwood Academy {{sued the}} {{association}} over this action. Brentwood {{argued that the}} enforcement of the rule constituted state action which they claimed violated the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The school asserted that their due process rights had been violated because there were no evidentiary hearings to determine the validity of the claim that they inappropriately recruited football players. Further, they argued that the rule violated their freedom of speech because it restricted the ways the Academy could recruit. In July 1998, the District Court agreed with this argument and granted summary judgement to the Academy, while enjoining the association from enforcing the rule. A year later, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the lower court's decision, <b>finding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> actions of the association did not constitute 'state action'. The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari of the case to review this question.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert surveils Watts, <b>finding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> latter {{has been}} in contact with Means. Black travels to where Means is living, where he {{remotely}} observes a cult-like ceremony in which Means is ritually inducted into the Group. He contacts Watts, divulging the results of his tests—they were injected with a vaccine while quarantined. Black warns Watts that the Group is dangerous; Watts neither confirms nor denies this, but predicts the arrival of an earthquake, urging Black that should this prediction come to pass, he should accept full membership of the Group. That night, Black answers a telephone call from Means, who tells him that the Group mean no harm. The line suddenly cuts, and the tremors of an earthquake begin just as Watts had predicted. Black moves through his home, noticing that his pet bird is dead in its cage, covered in blood.|$|E
50|$|Ebbesmeyer {{has worked}} with marine {{scientist}} Charles Moore, who, in 1999, published <b>findings</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ratio of plastic to zooplankton (in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre) is about six to one, with consequent harm to ocean life {{from the very start}} of the food chain.|$|R
30|$|Another {{interesting}} pattern {{observed in}} Figure  7 is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> goodness-of-fit test {{not only confirmed}} our <b>findings</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> importance of the Recency bias decays as we visit more locations between consecutive visits, but also it supports <b>the</b> evidence <b>that</b> such influence is bounded to approximately five locations.|$|R
50|$|Gelles reports {{personal}} attacks (such as death threats {{against him and}} his colleagues and bomb threats phoned in to their conferences) related to their <b>findings</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rate of assault by women on male partners {{is about the same}} as the rate by men on female partners.|$|R
5|$|He then {{falls asleep}} {{continuing}} {{to play the}} note. A dream sequence of the opening scene of the film Chariots of Fire shows the characters running across a beach, though Mr. Bean dreams he is running with them. He begins to fall behind, until he hails a car to overtake all the others. Now running in front, Bean ensures he wins the race on the beach by tripping one of the runners trying to overtake him, whereupon he crosses the line with elation, and then wakes up. <b>Finding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rest of the orchestra have stopped playing while he continued his one recurring note, Bean, with encouragement from Rattle, plays an extended flourish and lastly touches a note that makes a flatulent sound, then stops.|$|E
5|$|In {{answering}} {{both questions}} in the negative, the Court of Appeal overturned the High Court's <b>finding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> statute was unconstitutional. The Court of Appeal further clarified Singapore's stance on legislative plenary power and expounded upon Article 12(1) of the Constitution, explaining that the promise of equality {{does not mean that}} all persons are to be treated equally, but simply that all persons in like situations will be treated alike. Drawing on foreign case law, the Court of Appeal further outlined the test to determine if a differentiating law falls foul of Article 12.|$|E
5|$|Kaim had six battalions of infantry, four squadrons of cavalry {{and plenty}} of {{artillery}} deployed at Rothenzholl. He posted three more battalions at Frauenalb {{to the north and}} an advance guard in Loffenau. Saint-Cyr left Duhesme's division behind to guard Freudenstadt and the Kneibis Mountain. He started from Gernsbach with 12 battalions plus six more borrowed from the Reserve. <b>Finding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Saxons were marching south along the Enz River to turn his right flank, he sent Taponier with six battalions and 150 hussars east to Wildbad. Taponier surprised the Saxons and sent them scurrying back north. With Lambert and Lecourbe's brigades, Saint-Cyr advanced through Loffenau to Rothenzholl northwest of Dobel where he confronted Kaim. Finding the Austrians in powerful defenses, Saint-Cyr tried to draw Kaim's troops out of position.|$|E

5000|$|The state {{investigated}} the escape, holding MTC responsible for numerous security failures. Following <b>findings</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> company {{had failed to}} control a riot at Kingman prison in July 2015, in August 2015 the governor terminated MTC's contract with the state. It awarded the contract to GEO Group.|$|R

5|$|Like {{most other}} members of its genus, the phylogenetic {{position}} of the blacktip reef shark remains indeterminate. Based on morphology, Jack Garrick proposed in 1982 that the closest relative of the blacktip reef shark was the nervous shark (C.cautus). Leonard Compagno's 1988 morphological analysis suggested affinity not only between this species and the nervous shark, but also four other species, and could not resolve their relationships further. A 1998 allozyme analysis by Gavin Naylor again yielded ambiguous results, <b>finding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> blacktip reef shark forms a polytomy (irresolvable group) with 10 other Carcharhinus species.|$|E
5|$|On April 9, 1768, two customs {{employees}} (called tidesmen) boarded Hancock's brig Lydia in Boston Harbor. Hancock was summoned, and <b>finding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> agents {{lacked a}} writ of assistance (a general search warrant), {{he did not}} allow them to go below deck. When one of them later managed to get into the hold, Hancock's men forced the tidesman back on deck. Customs officials wanted to file charges, but the case was dropped when Massachusetts Attorney General Jonathan Sewall ruled that Hancock had broken no laws. Later, some of Hancock's most ardent admirers would call this incident the first act of physical resistance to British authority in the colonies and credit Hancock with initiating the American Revolution.|$|E
5|$|Paleoptera and Neoptera are {{the winged}} orders of insects {{differentiated}} {{by the presence}} of hardened body parts called sclerites, and in the Neoptera, muscles that allow their wings to fold flatly over the abdomen. Neoptera can further be divided into incomplete metamorphosis-based (Polyneoptera and Paraneoptera) and complete metamorphosis-based groups. It has proved difficult to clarify the relationships between the orders in Polyneoptera because of constant new findings calling for revision of the taxa. For example, the Paraneoptera {{have turned out to be}} more closely related to the Endopterygota than to the rest of the Exopterygota. The recent molecular <b>finding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> traditional louse orders Mallophaga and Anoplura are derived from within Psocoptera has led to the new taxon Psocodea. Phasmatodea and Embiidina have been suggested to form the Eukinolabia. Mantodea, Blattodea, and Isoptera are thought to form a monophyletic group termed Dictyoptera.|$|E
