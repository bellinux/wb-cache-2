25|$|Beyond addiction, both {{short and}} {{long-term}} nicotine exposure have not been established as dangerous to adults, except among certain vulnerable groups. At high-enough doses, nicotine is associated with poisonings and is potentially lethal. Nicotine {{as a tool for}} quitting smoking has a good safety history. There is inadequate research to show that nicotine itself is associated with cancer in humans. Nicotine in the form of nicotine replacement products is less of a cancer risk than smoking. Nicotine is linked to possible birth defects. During pregnancy, there are risks to the child later in life for type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, neurobehavioral defects, respiratory dysfunction, and infertility. The use of electronic cigarettes, which are designed to be refilled with nicotine-containing <b>e-liquid,</b> has raised concerns over nicotine overdoses, especially with regard to the possibility of young children ingesting the liquids.|$|E
2500|$|An {{electronic}} cigarette or e-cigarette is a handheld electronic device {{that tries to}} create the feeling of tobacco smoking. It works by heating a liquid to generate an aerosol, commonly called a [...] "vapor", that the user inhales. Using e-cigarettes is sometimes called vaping. The liquid in the e-cigarette, called <b>e-liquid,</b> is usually made of nicotine, propylene glycol, glycerine, and flavorings. Not all e-liquids contain nicotine.|$|E

The liquid quickly absorbs into the skin. The nicotine in <b>e-liquid</b> can be hazardous to infants. Even a portion of <b>e-liquid</b> may be lethal to a little child. An excessive amount of nicotine for a child that is capable of being fatal is 0.1-0.2 mg/kg of body weight.

40|$|AbstractFlavour {{ingredients}} are {{an essential part}} of <b>e-liquids.</b> Their responsible selection and inclusion levels in <b>e-liquids</b> must be guided by toxicological principles. We propose an approach to the screening and toxicological risk assessment of flavour ingredients for <b>e-liquids.</b> The screening involves purity requirements and avoiding ingredients that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction. Additionally, owing to the uncertainties involved in potency determination and the derivation of a tolerable level for respiratory sensitisation, we propose excluding respiratory sensitisers. After screening, toxicological data on the ingredients should be reviewed. Inhalation-specific toxicological issues, for which no reliable safe levels can currently be derived, can lead to further ingredient exclusions. We discuss the use of toxicological thresholds of concern for flavours that lack inhalation data suitable for quantitative risk assessment. Higher toxicological thresholds of concern are suggested for flavour ingredients (170 or 980 μg/day) than for contaminant assessment (1. 5 μg/day). Analytical detection limits for measurements of potential reaction and thermal breakdown products in vaping aerosol, should be informed by the contaminant threshold. This principle leads us to recommend 5 ng/puff as an appropriate limit of detection for untargeted aerosol measurements...|$|R

5000|$|The {{essential}} {{propylene glycol}} and/or glycerin mixture may consist of natural or artificial substances {{to provide it}} flavor. The cytotoxicity of <b>e-liquids</b> varies, and contamination with various chemicals have been detected in the liquid. Some liquids were very toxic and others {{had little or no}} cytotoxicity. The cytotoxicity is mostly due to the amount and number of flavors added. Since nicotine has a bitter taste, nicotine <b>e-liquids</b> contain chemicals to cover up the nicotine taste. The liquids contain aromatic substances like tobacco, fruit, vanilla, caramel and coffee. Generally, these additives are imprecisely described, using terms such as [...] "vegetable flavoring". Although they are approved for human consumption there are no studies on the short-term or long-term effects of inhaling them. The safety of inhaling flavors is mostly unknown, and their safety has not been determined by the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association. In some cases <b>e-liquids</b> contain very large amounts of flavorings, which may cause irritation and inflammation on respiratory and cardiovascular systems. Some flavors are regarded as toxic and a number of them resemble known carcinogens. Some artificial flavors are known to be cytotoxic. Unflavored vapor is less cytotoxic than flavored vapor.

The method uses a gas chromatographic separation on a Carbowax type column with the measurement of the analytes on a triplequadrupole mass spectrometer working in positive MRM mode. The method has been validated using standard requirements regarding selectivity, sensitivity, recovery, accuracy, and repeatability. The limit of quantitation (LOQ) for the method was determined to be 0. 41 ng/mL for diacetyl and 0. 21 ng/mL for acetylpropionyl as measured for standards. These values translate to an LOQ of 0. 082 ng/puff for diacetyl and 0. 042 ng/puff for acetylpropionyl as measured for an e-cigarette with 50 puffs placed in 10 mL acetone. The samples analyzed included collected aerosols from several e-cigarettes, and a number of liquids used in electronic cigarettes (<b>e-liquids).</b> 3 R 4 F Kentucky reference cigarette was also analyzed for evaluating the accuracy of the procedure, with good agreement with data from the literature. Diacetyl and acetylpropionyl were distributed in both particulate phase and also in vapor phase.

40|$|Introduction This study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} and evaluate potential discrepancies in the reported vs. measured nicotine content of <b>e-liquids.</b> Material and Methods Within the Horizon 2020, EUREST-PLUS study, 122 {{of the most commonly}} sold <b>e-liquids</b> in 9 European Countries were randomly selected and purchased. A quantitative liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry based analysis was performed so as to assess nicotine concentrations. Results Out of the 122 samples analyzed, differences in the concentrations of nicotine compared to the indicated levels on the vial were found. Refill vials from France had an increase in nicotine content between 3. 7 % up to 47. 9 % higher than the reported amount, while on the contrary samples from Romania were found to over report their nicotine content (- 49. 1 % up to - 9. 9 %). Samples from other countries identified both increased and decreased nicotine concentrations. Polish <b>e-liquids</b> had a range from - 6. 4 % up to + 37. 2 % in nicotine content, German samples (- 71. 7 % up to + 24. 5 %), Netherlands samples (- 6. 5 % up to + 23. 6 %), United Kingdom samples (- 12. 8 % up to 22. 9 %), Spanish samples (- 46. 3 % up to 7. 2 %), Hungarian samples (- 41. 9 % up to 19, 9 %) and Greek samples (- 34. 5 % up to 17. 5 %). Furthermore, out of all 122 samples, 12 samples exceeded the limit of 20 mg/ml based on the indicted nicotine levels of the vial and 3 samples were marketed to exceeded the limit.

40|$|Abstract: The {{emergence}} of electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) has given cannabis smokers a new method of inhaling cannabinoids. E-cigs differ from traditional marijuana cigarettes in several respects. First, {{it is assumed}} that vaporizing cannabinoids at lower temperatures is safer because it produces smaller amounts of toxic substances than the hot combustion of a marijuana cigarette. Recreational cannabis users can discretely “vape ” deodorized cannabis extracts with minimal annoyance to the people around them and less chance of detection.
