30|$|The life of {{a project}} can easily attain 20 to 30  years between the {{political}} decision idea and the DUP (declaration of public utility). The commissioning process can also require several years. As a result, the socio-economic planning context permitting {{the definition of the}} project characteristics (method, capacity, on site development or new construction, route) is liable to change between the preliminary studies, the preliminary <b>design</b> <b>file,</b> the final draft <b>design</b> <b>file</b> and the commissioning. It is difficult for planners to provide a detailed forecast of lifestyles, demographic developments, growth of GDP and other variables that might influence traffic flows over 10, 15, 20  years or more. It should also be underlined that currently, mobility is characterised by a certain unpredictability because mobility practices change rapidly. Literature in the sector underlines this difficulty in predicting the future and, in particular, the creation of reliable traffic forecasts [3].|$|E
