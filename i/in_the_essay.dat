5|$|A {{revival of}} {{interest}} in Hazlitt, as a thinker, began in the mid-20th century. His thoughts on Shakespeare's plays as a whole (particularly the tragedies), his discussions of certain characters such as Shylock, Falstaff, Imogen, Caliban and Iago and his ideas {{about the nature of}} drama and poetry in general, such as expressed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>essay</b> on Coriolanus, gained renewed appreciation and influenced other Shakespearean criticism.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{note that}} Tolkien {{attempted}} and sometimes failed {{to follow the}} rules he laid down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>essay</b> in his own alliterative verse, in his own translations, and indeed in his narrative fiction such as The Lord of the Rings.|$|E
5|$|While he was {{a student}} at Vendôme, Balzac wrote an essay called Traité de la Volonté ("Treatise on the Will"); it is {{described}} in the novel as being written by Louis Lambert. The essay discusses the philosophy of Swedenborg and others, although Balzac did not explore many of the metaphysical concepts until much later in his life. Ideas analyzed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>essay</b> and elsewhere in the novel include the split between inward and outward existence; the presence of angels and spiritual enlightenment; and the interplay between genius and madness.|$|E

25|$|Thomas Huxley, Darwin's Bulldog, {{spent much}} of his book Evolution and Ethics debunking Social Darwinism, piece by piece. The {{following}} is a summary of his arguments in the Prolegomena, the most detailed and comprehensive of the two sections devoted to it. It should be noted that Huxley is here attempting to disprove the science behind Social Darwinism; as such, the moral arguments only come in later <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>essay.</b>|$|E
25|$|Wells {{also wrote}} an essay titled 'Intelligence on Mars', {{published}} in 1896 in the Saturday Review, which sets out {{many of the}} ideas for the Martians and their planet that are used almost unchanged in The War of the Worlds. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>essay</b> he speculates {{about the nature of}} the Martian inhabitants and how their evolutionary progress might compare to humans. He also suggests that Mars, being an older world than the Earth, might have become frozen and desolate, conditions that might encourage the Martians to find another planet on which to settle.|$|E
40|$|For Lacan, Montaigne is {{a figure}} of {{tremendous}} interest and significance. Although rarely read as such, when read at all outside the philosophical tradition of reason, one can find <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Essays</b> a psychoanalytic perspective on the imaginary order that is provocative in its very depth. By examining closely several of <b>the</b> individual <b>essays,</b> <b>in</b> particular <b>the</b> very early <b>essay</b> "Of idleness," {{looking for signs of}} an unravelling of the subject-image-ego structure, there is a case to be made for situating the notion of the corps morcele {{at the very heart of}} Montaigne's project undertaken <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Essays.</b> Revealed to be an analytic instance of ego decomposition, resulting in images of fragmented bodies and disordered corporeal forms, Montaigne descends into the imaginary order, confronting the turbulent and animated existence of the lived body. What makes this significant for Lacanian psychoanalysis, is that Montaigne, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Essays,</b> explores <b>the</b> experience of the body-subject within the imaginary order, even going so far as to adopt an imagistic orientation <b>in</b> characterizing both <b>the</b> form of <b>the</b> <b>essay</b> and its corporeal content. Lacan was fond of referring to the painter Hieronymous Bosch and his "Garden of Earthly Delights" as a portrait of <b>the</b> corps morcele. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Essays,</b> Montaigne emerges as a literary cousin of Bosch, possessing, arguably, an even greater descriptive potential for comprehending the how the body manfests itself to <b>the</b> psychoanalytic subject <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wake of ego decomposition...|$|R

25|$|In the sequels it is {{made clear}} that the {{language}} of the hrossa is the primary Old Solar language, and that the languages of the other two species are late derivatives of it. This represents Lewis' view that the symbolic and mythopoeic imagination is the primary language of the human mind and that scientific and technological analysis is a later development. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>essay</b> Bluspels and Flalansferes: A Semantic Nightmare he argues that, though reason is the organ of truth, imagination is the organ of meaning.|$|E
25|$|In 1944 de Beauvoir {{wrote her}} first {{philosophical}} essay, Pyrrhus et Cinéas, {{a discussion of}} an existentialist ethics. She continued her exploration of existentialism through her second essay The Ethics of Ambiguity (1947); it {{is perhaps the most}} accessible entry into French existentialism. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>essay,</b> de Beauvoir clears up some inconsistencies that many, Sartre included, have found in major existentialist works such as Being and Nothingness. In The Ethics of Ambiguity, de Beauvoir confronts the existentialist dilemma of absolute freedom vs. the constraints of circumstance.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, Benedict Anderson and Ruth McVey {{wrote an}} article which {{came to be known}} as the Cornell Paper. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>essay</b> they {{proposed}} that the 30 September Movement was indeed entirely an internal army affair as the PKI had claimed. They claimed that the action was a result of dissatisfaction on the part of junior officers, who found it extremely difficult to obtain promotions and resented the generals' corrupt and decadent lifestyles. They allege that the PKI was deliberately involved by, for example, bringing Aidit to Halim: a diversion from the embarrassing fact the Army was behind the movement.|$|E

50|$|Another {{reference}} to the creatures of The Time Machine occurs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>essay's</b> section Recovery, Escape, Consolation. Here it's argued that fantasy offers a legitimate means of escape from the mundane world and the 'Morlockian horror of factories'.|$|R
25|$|In the {{conclusion}} to the essay, he wrote of the Jews that 'only one thing can redeem you from the burden of your curse: the redemption of Ahasuerus — going under!' Although this has been taken by some commentators to mean actual physical annihilation, {{in the context of}} the essay it seems to refer only to the eradication of Jewish separateness and traditions. Wagner advises Jews to follow the example of Ludwig Börne by abandoning Judaism. In this way Jews will take part in 'this regenerative work of deliverance through self-annulment; then are we one and un-dissevered!' Wagner was therefore calling for the assimilation of Jews into mainstream German culture and society - although there can be little doubt, from the words he uses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>essay,</b> that this call was prompted at least as much by anti-semitism as by a desire for social amelioration. (In the very first publication, the word here translated as 'self-annulment' was represented by the phrase 'self-annihilating, bloody struggle').|$|E
500|$|During the {{interval}} of the concert, BBC Radio 3 broadcast [...] "Let's Do the Time Warp Again", a 25-minute commentary by science fiction writer Justina Robson. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>essay,</b> Robson discussed the moral contradictions of Doctor Who and compared the programme with religious texts {{as a cultural}} touchstone.|$|E
500|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>essay</b> on King Lear, {{which he}} {{entitled}} simply [...] "Lear", Hazlitt makes no {{references to the}} performances of any actors. In fact, here he fully agrees with Lamb that King Lear, like Hamlet, cannot be adequately presented on stage. No actors, he felt, could {{do justice to the}} overwhelming imaginative power of this play.|$|E

The methodological tools employed are varied, too. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> theoretical <b>essays,</b> contributions are made to the literature on network and endogenous coalition formation. <b>The</b> empirical <b>essays</b> employ linear and non-linear regression models and use aggregate as well as micro-level data. ...|$|R

500|$|These {{negative}} associations have to a {{large degree}} overshadowed the historical impact of Uncle Tom's Cabin as a [...] "vital antislavery tool".
