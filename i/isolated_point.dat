The completeness assumption is automatically fulfilled for a surface which is embedded as a closed subset of Euclidean space. However, it is no longer fulfilled if, for example, we remove an <b>isolated</b> <b>point</b> from a surface. For example, the complement of the origin in the Euclidean plane {{is an example of a}} non-complete surface; in this example two points which are diametrically opposite across the origin cannot {{be joined by a}} geodesic without leaving the punctured plane).|$|E

With the help of graphs and the Kosniowski-Stong formula, up to cobordism all (Z 2) k-actions fixing three <b>isolated</b> <b>points</b> (resp. four <b>isolated</b> <b>points)</b> are classified completely, and at the same time, the Smith problem for (Z 2) k-actions fixing three <b>isolated</b> <b>points</b> (resp. four <b>isolated</b> <b>points)</b> is also solved...|$|R

2500|$|This {{definition}} only {{requires that}} the domain and the codomain are topological spaces and is thus the most general definition.

2500|$|A {{consequence}} of this definition is that [...] is trivially continuous at any <b>isolated</b> <b>point</b> [...] [...] This somewhat unintuitive treatment of isolated points is necessary to ensure that our definition of continuity for functions on the real line {{is consistent with the}} most general definition of continuity for maps between topological spaces (which includes metric spaces and [...] in particular as special cases).

60|$|It was by {{no means}} a {{difficult}} thing to go down the river, now that so many canoes were in motion on it, at all hours. The bee-hunter knew what points were to be avoided, and took care not to approach a sentinel. The river, or strait, is less than a mile wide, and by keeping in the centre of the passage, the canoes, favored by both wind and current, drove by the town, then an inconsiderable village, without detection. As soon as far enough below, the canoes were again cast loose from each other, and sail was made on each. The water was smooth, and some time before the return of light the fugitives were abreast of Malden, but in the American channel. Had it been otherwise, the danger could not have been great. So completely were the Americans subdued by Hull's capitulation, and so numerous were the Indian allies of the British, that the passage of a bark canoe, more or less, would hardly have attracted attention. At that time, Michigan was a province of but little more than a name. The territory was wide, to be sure, but the entire population was not larger than that of a moderately sized English market town, and Detroit was then regarded as a distant and <b>isolated</b> <b>point.</b> It is true that Mackinac and Chicago were both more remote, and both more isolated, but an English force, in possession of Detroit, could be approached by the Americans {{on the side of the}} land only by overcoming the obstacles of a broad belt of difficult wilderness. This was done the succeeding year, it is true, but time is always necessary to bring out Jonathan's latent military energies. When aroused, they are not trifling, as all his enemies have been made to feel; but a good deal of miscalculation, pretending ignorance, and useless talking must be expended, before the really efficient are allowed to set about serving the country in their own way.|$|E
