It can be an alternative to large surface storages with water being pumped up again from below the surface in dry periods.|$|E
25|$|Some {{historic}} systems {{used for}} pioneering aerial refueling used the grappling method, where the tanker aircraft unreeled the fuel hose and the receiver aircraft would grapple the hose midair, reel {{it in and}} connect it so that fuel can be transferred either {{with the assistance of}} pumps or simply by <b>gravity</b> <b>feed.</b> This was the method used on the Question Mark endurance flight in 1929.|$|E
25|$|Carbon {{arc lamps}} were started by making contact between two carbon electrodes, {{which were then}} {{separated}} to within a narrow gap. Because the carbon burned away, the gap had to be constantly readjusted. Several mechanisms were developed to regulate the arc. A common approach was to feed a carbon electrode by gravity and maintain the gap {{with a pair of}} electromagnets, one of which retracted the upper carbon after the arc was started and the second controlled a brake on the <b>gravity</b> <b>feed.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Rosia Water Tanks {{consisted}} of six parallel underground chambers built by contractor Giovanni Maria Boschetti {{adjacent to the}} Victualling Yard of bricks brought from Britain and sand-lime mortar, then waterproofed. The roofs of the Victualling Yard served as a catchment directing rain to a settlement tank, which was then purified by flowing it successively from one tank to the next. The lowest tank was sufficiently high to <b>gravity</b> <b>feed</b> vessels berthed at Rosia Mole. Hoses were used to supply vessels within Rosia Bay, a lighter barge those anchored off it in Gibraltar Harbour.|$|E
25|$|The {{source of}} {{illumination}} had generally been wood pyres or burning coal. The Argand lamp, invented in 1782 by the Swiss scientist, Aimé Argand, revolutionized lighthouse illumination with its steady smokeless flame. Early models used ground glass which was sometimes tinted around the wick. Later models used a mantle of thorium dioxide suspended over the flame, creating a bright, steady light. The Argand lamp used whale oil, colza, olive oil or other vegetable oil as fuel which was supplied by a <b>gravity</b> <b>feed</b> from a reservoir mounted above the burner. The lamp was first produced by Matthew Boulton, {{in partnership with}} Argand, in 1784 and became the standard for lighthouses for over a century.|$|E
25|$|This {{period is}} characterised by periods of slow to {{moderate}} population growth, with industrial and education industries developing {{and technology and}} services delivered to the town. Several major infrastructure developments arrive such as distributed town gas, electricity, town water supplies, and a sewage treatment system. Town gas had arrived in Bathurst courtesy of a private venture in 1872, with the Council providing a competing network from 1888. On 30 June 1914, the Council purchased the Wark Bros gas system and combined the gas networks. The old gasworks plant on Russell Street (now out of use) was built in 1960. In 1987 natural gas arrived via a new 240km spur pipeline off the Moomba to Sydney pipeline. The {{early part of the}} century saw electricity arrive initially for street lighting; the city converted from gas street lighting to electric lighting on 22 December 1924, when 370 electric lights at a cost of ₤40,000 were switched on. Lighting spread along streets through to 1935, over time to businesses and finally private houses. Sewage treatment was an early infrastructure project funded by the state government and built in 1915. Water supply started with private wells in backyards. Eventually a waterworks was built to the south of the town on the river with the water pumped through piping laid progressively to the businesses and private dwellings. In 1931, work started on the 1,700 ML Winburndale Dam project to <b>gravity</b> <b>feed</b> water through a wood stave pipe laid to the town. The scheme was opened by the Premier of New South Wales on 7 October 1933. Later, a new larger water supply dam was built on the Campbells River. Originally known as the Campbell River Dam scheme and later renamed the Ben Chifley Dam after the late Prime Minister Ben Chifley of Bathurst. It was opened in November 1956. The Ben Chifley Dam received a major storage upgrade designed to meet the cities needs to 2050; the work was completed in 2001 increasing the capacity by 30% to 30,800 ML.|$|E
50|$|Agitating hoppers use a propeller, {{spinning}} {{inside the}} container, to agitate the paintballs. This {{prevents them from}} jamming at the feed neck, allowing them to feed more rapidly than <b>gravity</b> <b>feeds.</b> Older tournament-level hoppers are of the agitating type, since the higher rate of fire requires a reliable hopper.|$|R
50|$|Stick feeds {{are mainly}} used on pump and stock-class markers. They consist of simple tubes that hold between ten and twenty paintballs. Stick feeds are usually {{parallel}} to the barrel; player must tip the marker to load the next paintball. Some stick feeds are vertical, or at an incline to facilitate <b>gravity</b> <b>feeding,</b> though this contravenes accepted stock-class guidelines.|$|R

As a rule about 40 litres of water per day are needed for every 100 plants, although this can vary depending upon what is being grown.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Gravity</b> <b>feed</b> saws {{fall under}} their own weight. [...] Most such saws have a method to allow the cutting force to be adjusted, such as a movable {{counterbalancing}} weight, a coil spring with a screw-thread adjustment, or a hydraulic or pneumatic damper (speed control valve). The latter does not force the blade downwards, but rather simply limits {{the speed at which}} the saw can fall, preventing excessive feed on thin or soft parts. This is analogous to door closer hardware whose dampering action keeps the door from slamming. <b>Gravity</b> <b>feed</b> designs are common in small saws.|$|E

[...] <b>Gravity</b> <b>feed</b> instruments require less air pressure for suction as the gravity pulls the paint into the mixing chamber. [...] Typically instruments with the finest mist atomization and detail requirements use this method since less air pressure allows for finer control paint flow and less overspray. [...] Side- and bottom-feed instruments allow the artist {{to see over the}} top, with the former sometimes offering left-handed and right-handed options to suit the artist. [...] A bottom feed airbrush typically holds a larger capacity of paint than the other types, and is often preferable for larger scale work such as automotive applications and tee-shirt design.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} had two {{fuel tanks}} {{with a total}} capacity of around [...] The main tank (divided into two parts for redundancy) was supplemented by a smaller, [...] "gravity tank". This was intended to supply fuel to the engine by <b>gravity</b> <b>feed</b> {{in the event of}} an engine fuel pump failure; it contained enough fuel for thirty minutes on full power. There was a manual fuel pump for use when the gravity tank became exhausted.|$|E
50|$|The {{construction}} of the Ord River Diversion Dam started in late 1960 and was officially opened in July 1963 by then Prime Minister, Robert Menzies. The Ord River Diversion Dam holds back Lake Kununurra, which <b>gravity</b> <b>feeds</b> the Ord River Irrigation Area with water via the Main Channel (M1C1). The main channel is visible in the photograph with Lake Kununurra, Ord River (formerly the Carlton Reach waterhole, Ord River) in the background.|$|R
50|$|The dam {{is part of}} {{a unique}} water supply system that <b>gravity</b> <b>feeds</b> up to 50 megalitres of water per day to the city of Townsville. For most of the year water flowing from the Mount Spec part of the {{national}} park is collected and filtered at the Crystal Creek intake and then piped under gravity to Townsville. When Crystal Creek water levels are low, water is released into the creek from Lake Paluma via another gravity pipeline.|$|R
50|$|The {{closing of}} the Onondaga Salt Springs Reservation in the early 1900s and the end to mining brine in the {{southern}} part of the Tully valley in the late 1900s marked the end of salt mining in the Syracuse region. However, groundwater flowing along the southeastern shore of Onondaga lake in Syracuse still allows salty water from a thousand feet below the southern Tully valley to flow by <b>gravity,</b> <b>feeding</b> salt springs around the lake where the Salina shale contains no halite beds.|$|R
2500|$|Work {{began to}} {{construct}} the reservoirs the following year in 1893. Construction was overseen by James Mansergh, {{on behalf of the}} City of Birmingham's Water Department. Due to the height above sea level of the Elan Valley, water would be fed to Birmingham along a [...] pipeline that employed a <b>gravity</b> <b>feed</b> with a gradient of 1 in 2,300. The schedule for the project was to build the four lower Elan Valley dams first. The Claerwen would then be built later (work was expected to begin 1939 but was delayed by the Second World War; it was completed in 1952).|$|E
2500|$|It was a two-seat, single-engined low-winged monoplane, mounted {{originally}} on twin floats. [...] Like {{the slightly}} earlier Short Cockle, Satellite and Springbok, {{it had a}} duralumin monocoque fuselage of oval cross section. [...] There were a pair of tandem open cockpits over the wing fitted with dual controls. Contemporary commentators regarded the mounting of the upright four cylinder [...] ADC Cirrus I engine as particularly neatly done, in a U-shaped extension of the monocoque which initially left {{the top of the}} engine exposed. This engine was changed for an [...] Cirrus II in January 1928. [...] The fuel tank was immediately behind the fire wall, high enough to <b>gravity</b> <b>feed</b> the carburettor. There was a direct reading fuel gauge above the tank, {{just in front of the}} forward cockpit, enclosed a in variety of fairings over the Mussel's lifetime.|$|E
2500|$|The spans and wing {{areas of}} the DH.9A and H.P.20 were about the same, so the wing chord of the {{monoplane}} was about double that of the biplane. As a result, the tailing edge extended aft beyond the DH.9A's pilot's cockpit and so the H.P.20 was flown from {{what had been the}} gunner's position. There was a small cut out in the trailing edge to enhance the pilot's view. As there was no upper wing to house the fuel, the H.P.20 had a slightly round-ended cylindrical tank mounted high over the centre section to provide <b>gravity</b> <b>feed.</b> [...] Because high angles of attack were used in landing and take off with the slots open, the undercarriage was lengthened, as it had been on the H.P.17. There was an airflow direction indicator mounted on a little boom which projected forward of the starboard wing.|$|E
50|$|The {{molten polymer}} {{undergoes}} snap cooling {{as it passes}} by <b>gravity</b> <b>feeding</b> through a brass mandrel, which imparts on the thin film many properties, including its transparency.

25|$|Due {{to lack of}} suction, {{an infant}} with a cleft may have trouble feeding. An infant with a cleft palate will have greater success feeding in a more upright position. Gravity will help prevent milk from coming through the baby's nose if he/she has cleft palate. <b>Gravity</b> <b>feeding</b> can be {{accomplished}} by using specialized equipment, such as the Haberman Feeder, or by using a combination of nipples and bottle inserts like the one shown, is commonly used with other infants. A large hole, crosscut, or slit in the nipple, a protruding nipple and rhythmically squeezing the bottle insert can result in controllable flow to the infant without the stigma caused by specialized equipment.|$|R
2500|$|Horizontal {{bandsaws}} {{hold the}} workpiece stationary while the blade swings {{down through the}} cut. [...] This configuration is used to cut long materials such as pipe or bar stock to length. Thus {{it is an important}} part of the facilities in most machine shops. The horizontal design is not useful for cutting curves or complicated shapes. [...] Small horizontal bandsaws typically employ a <b>gravity</b> <b>feed</b> alone, retarded to an adjustable degree by a coil spring; on industrial models, the rate of descent is usually controlled by a hydraulic cylinder that bleeds through an adjustable valve. [...] When the saw is set up for a cut, the operator raises the saw, positions the material to be cut underneath the blade, and then turns on the saw. [...] The blade slowly descends into the material, cutting it as the band blade moves. When the cut is complete, a switch is tripped and the saw automatically turns off. [...] More sophisticated versions of this type of saw are partially or entirely automated (via PLC or CNC) for high-volume cutting of machining blanks. Such machines provide a stream of cutting fluid recirculated from a sump, in the same manner that a CNC machining center does.|$|E
