5|$|The Dutch {{released}} {{reports of}} <b>German</b> <b>soldiers</b> in disguise {{to the international}} news agencies. This caused a fifth column scare, especially in Belgium and France. However, unlike the situation later on in those two countries, in the Netherlands there was no mass exodus of civilian refugees, clogging the roads. Generally <b>German</b> <b>soldiers</b> behaved in a civilised manner towards the Dutch population, forming neat queues at the shops to buy goods rationed in Germany, such as chocolate.|$|E

5|$|Rape was a {{widespread}} {{phenomenon in the}} East as <b>German</b> <b>soldiers</b> regularly committed violent sexual acts against Soviet women. Whole units were occasionally involved in the crime with upwards of one-third of the instances being gang-rape. Frequently {{in the case of}} Jewish women, they were immediately murdered following acts of sexual violence. Historian Birgit Beck emphasizes that military decrees, which served to authorize wholesale brutality on many levels, essentially destroyed the basis for any prosecution of sexual offenses committed by <b>German</b> <b>soldiers</b> in the East. She also contends that detection of such instances was limited by the fact that sexual violence was often inflicted in the context of billets in civilian housing.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, {{the company}} {{came under heavy fire}} {{from an old}} quarry {{occupied}} by over one hundred <b>German</b> <b>soldiers</b> who possessed as many as forty machine guns. Severe casualties were sustained as they began to advance for attack, including the company commander who fell seriously wounded. Taking command of the attack, Ingram rallied the men and rushed forward. Jumping into the quarry, he charged the first post himself, shooting six <b>German</b> <b>soldiers</b> and capturing a machine gun. The German forces were soon overcome, and thirty troops subsequently surrendered.|$|E
50|$|Hitler, at {{some time}} {{in the latter half of}} 1944, ordered that 10 civilians be killed each time a <b>German</b> <b>soldier</b> was killed by civilians. In Denmark, this was {{modified}} so that only one civilian was shot for one <b>German</b> <b>soldier.</b>|$|R

5|$|Atrocities {{continued}} {{during the}} German retreat from Southern France as <b>German</b> <b>soldiers</b> plundered and burned down towns. French civilians were brought before ad-hoc military courts {{and sentenced to}} death because of alleged partisan activities. These atrocities did not help to subdue the French uprising. Instead, the German reprisals had the opposite effect and encouraged the French population to engage in partisan fighting.|$|E

During the Warsaw Uprising, the Home Army even managed to capture several German armored vehicles.|$|E

5|$|Skirmishes on the {{frontier}} between Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire first occurred in 1050. Emperor Henry invaded Hungary in August 1051, but Andrew and Béla successfully applied scorched earth tactics against the imperial troops and forced them to withdraw.

5|$|The German {{occupation}} of the Channel Islands during the Second World War essentially by-passed Herm. The island was claimed on 20 July 1940 by the Third Reich, {{a few weeks after}} the arrival of German troops in Guernsey and Jersey, <b>German</b> <b>soldiers</b> landed on the island to shoot a propaganda film, The Invasion of the Isle of Wight. Herm's sandy beaches were soon used for practising landings from barges, in preparation for the invasion of England, but otherwise the island saw little of the Germans beyond officers making trips to shoot rabbits. Herm had only a little German construction during the war; a flak battery was placed on the island for a few weeks, and mines were placed in an area. Occasionally <b>German</b> <b>soldiers</b> would travel to Herm to cut wood for fuel. In April 1945 a German officer, Oberst von Helldorf was exiled to Herm for not displaying sufficient loyalty to the Führer.|$|E
5|$|The {{domestic}} political environment was {{further complicated by}} the death of Paul Eyschen, who had been Prime Minister for 27 years.

5|$|After {{peace talks}} between the Germans and the Finnish Reds were broken off on 11 April, the true battle for the capital of Finland began. On 12 April, at 5 a.m. 2,000–3,000 <b>German</b> <b>soldiers</b> from the Brigade von Tshirsky {{attacked}} the city from the north-west, supported via the Helsinki-Turku railway. The Germans broke through the area between Munkkiniemi and Pasila, and advanced on the central-western parts of the town. The German naval squadron Meurer blocked the city harbour, bombarded the southern town area, and landed naval troops at Katajanokka.|$|E
5|$|As elsewhere, {{sabotage}} {{was employed}} against enemy {{military and economic}} assets, with railway lines and bridges being common targets. The activities of Groupe G, a small student resistance cell based in Brussels, alone are estimated to have cost the Nazis 10 million man-hours of labour to repair damages done. Direct attacks on German troops and military installations were rarer, yet one estimate puts the number of <b>German</b> <b>soldiers</b> killed by the Belgian resistance in 1941 as higher than in all of France.|$|E
