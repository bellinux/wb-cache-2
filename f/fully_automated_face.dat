The image normalization step consists of eye center localization, scale correction and orientation correction. This paper investigates the comparison and combination of four face matchers on the automatically normalized face images: elastic bunch graph matching (EBGM), trace transform, PCA, and LDA. The performance evaluation is presented {{on the near}} infrared images acquired from the 102 users in two sessions with different pose and expressions. Our experimental results achieve the best results with the EER of 3. 92 % from the EBGM matcher while the combination of results from the different matchers can significantly improve the performance and achieve the EER of 2. 28 %. The near infrared face database developed in this work is also made publicly available to foster further research. 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a novel approach}} for <b>fully</b> <b>automated</b> <b>face</b> recognition and show its feasibility on a large data base of facial images (FERET). Our approach, based on a hybrid architecture consisting of an ensemble of connectionist networks - radial basis functions (RBF) - and inductive decision trees (DT), combines the merits of 'discrete and abstractive' features with those of 'holistic' template matching'. Training for face detection takes place over {{both positive and negative}} examples. The benefits of our architecture include (i) robust detection of facial landmarks using decision trees, and (ii) robust face recognition using consensus methods over ensembles of RBF networks. Experiments carried out using k - fold cross validation on a large data base consisting of 748 images corresponding to 374 subjects, among them 11 duplicates, yield on the average 87 % correct match, and (ROC curves where) 99 % correct verification is achieved for a 2 % reject rate. 1.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} for fitting a 3 D mor-phable model to images of faces, using self-adapting feature layers (SAFL). The algorithm integrates feature detection into an iterative analysis-by-synthesis framework, combining the robustness of feature search with the flexibility of model fitting. Templates for facial features are created and updated while the fitting algorithm converges, so the templates adapt to the pose, illumination, shape and texture of the individual face. Un-like most existing feature-based methods, the algorithm does not search for the image locations with maximum response, which may be prone to errors, but forms a tradeoff between feature likeness, global feature configuration and image reconstruction error. The benefit of the proposed method is an increased robustness of model fitting with respect to errors in the initial feature point positions. Such residual errors are a problem when feature detection and model fitting are combined to form a <b>fully</b> <b>automated</b> <b>face</b> reconstruction or recogni-tion system. We analyze the robustness in a face recognition scenario on images from two databases: FRGC and FERET. ...|$|E

40|$|Identifying {{the type}} of {{modalities}} of the query image which can be of types visual, NIR, digital camera, web camera etc. have been assumed to be available before face matching. This leads to a major drawback in achieving <b>fully</b> <b>automated</b> heterogeneous <b>face</b> recognition as real world scenarios cannot be reflected. Therefore, modality identification {{is an important component}} of the heterogeneous face recognition system which is being overlooked by majority of the state-of-the-art methods. This component should be given similar attention when comparing with other face recognition modules identifying pose, gesture, camera source etc. In this paper inspired from sensor pattern noise (SPN) estimation based approaches, a novel image sharpening based modality pattern noise technique is proposed for modality identification. The proposed system has been evaluated on three challenging benchmarks of heterogeneous face databases. The proposed technique has produced outstanding results and will open new avenues of research for automated HFR methods in future...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a <b>fully</b> <b>automated</b> <b>face</b> recognition system with incremental learning ability {{that has the}} follow-ing two desirable features: one-pass incremental learning and automatic generation of training data. As a classifier of face images, an evolving type of neural network called Re-source Allocating Network with Long-Term Memory (RAN-LTM) is adopted here. This model enables us to realize ef-ficient incremental learning without suffering from serious forgetting. In the face detection procedure, face localiza-tion is conducted {{based on the information}} of skin color and edges at first. Then, facial features are searched for within the localized regions using a Resource Allocation Network, and the selected features are used for in the construction of face candidates. After the face detection, the face candi-dates are classified using RAN-LTM. The incremental learn-ing routine is applied to only misclassified data that are col-lected automatically in the recognition phase. Experimental results show that the recognition accuracy improves with-out increasing the false-positive rate even if the incremen-tal learning proceeds. This fact suggests that incremental learning is a useful approach to face recognition tasks. 1...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} about an attempt to unravel the {{classical}} problem of <b>automated</b> human <b>face</b> recognition. A near realtime, <b>fully</b> <b>automated</b> computer vision system was developed to detect and recognise expressionless, frontalview human faces in static images. In the implemented system, <b>automated</b> <b>face</b> detection was achieved using a deformable template algorithm based on image invariants. The natural symmetry of human faces was utilised to improve {{the efficiency of the}} face detection model. The deformable template was run down the line of symmetry of the face in search of the exact face location. Once the location of the face in an image was known, this pixel region was extracted and the test subject was recognized using principal component analysis, also known as the eigenface approach...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In this {{research}} an innovative <b>fully</b> <b>automated</b> 3 D <b>face</b> compression and recognition system is presented. Several novelties {{are introduced to}} make the system performance robust and efficient. These novelties include: First, an automatic pose correction and normalization process by using curvature analysis for nose tip detection and iterative closest point (ICP) image registration. Second, the use of spherical based wavelet coefficients for efficient representation of the 3 D face. The spherical wavelet transformation is used to decompose the face image into multi-resolution sub images characterizing the underlying functions in a local fashion in both spacial and frequency domains. Two representation features based on spherical wavelet parameterization of the face image were proposed for the 3 D face compression and recognition. Principle component analysis (PCA) is used to project to a low resolution sub-band. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, experiments were performed on the GAVAB face database. Experimental results show that the spherical wavelet coefficients yield excellent compression capabilities with minimal set of features. Haar wavelet coefficients extracted from the face geometry image was found to generate good recognition results that outperform other methods working on the GAVAB database...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a <b>fully</b> <b>automated</b> 3 D <b>face</b> authentication (verification) and recognition (identification) method and recent results from our {{work in this}} area. The major contributions of our paper are: (a) the method can handle data with different facial expressions including hair, upper body, clothing, etc. and (b) development of weighted features for discrimination. The input to our system is a triangular mesh and it outputs a matching % against a gallery. Our method includes both surface and curve based features that are automatically extracted from a given face data. The test set for authentication consisted of 117 different people with 421 scans including different facial expressions. Our study shows Equal Error Rate (EER) at 0. 065 % for normal faces and 1. 13 % in faces with expressions. We report verification rates of 100 % in normal faces and 93. 12 % in faces with expressions at 0. 1 % FAR. For identification, our experiment shows 100 % rate in normal faces and 95. 6 % in faces with expressions. From our experiment we conclude that combining feature points, profile curve, and partial face surface matching gives better authentication and recognition rate than any single matching method. 1...|$|R
