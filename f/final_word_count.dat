40|$|The {{ability of}} {{students}} to successfully fulfill coursework requirements is an important topic {{in the fields of}} education as well as psychology. The present study was designed {{to examine the effects of}} placing a minimum <b>word</b> <b>count</b> on a writing task. The participants were asked to complete a writing prompt that may or may not have contained a minimum <b>word</b> <b>count.</b> The number of words written for both groups was then analyzed.

30|$|Earlier Spark {{experiments}} have reported sub-second latency for Grep, <b>word</b> <b>count,</b> and TopKCount applications [12]. Other <b>word</b> <b>count</b> experiments with Spark (without database integration) indicated a processing latency of 2 – 3  s [9], which {{is higher than}} the result reported in this paper (Fig.  9). The reported <b>word</b> <b>count</b> latency (in this paper) was on a sub-second range. The difference (to [9]) may be explained with a different data set, and version of Spark (v 0.9 vs. v 1.3. 1). Execution of sentiment analysis with Cassandra led to queueing at Spark server, and much higher latencies (Fig.  11). However, when both algorithms were executed without a database, latency dropped lower than 1  s.|$|R
