5|$|A 2010 {{study of}} the stream found that the Fonteyn Kill's {{specific}} conductance, {{a measure of the}} amount of dissolved road salt in the stream's water, was nearly 1.0 mS/cm, higher than any value recorded in the Casperkill. Sites upstream of Vassar Lake were recorded in a separate study as having specific conductances twice as <b>high</b> <b>as</b> locations downstream of the lake, suggesting a regulating effect caused by water mixing and retention in Vassar Lake. The total inorganic nitrogen in the kill, which is usually correlated with surrounding green cover, was about , average for measurements taken in the Fonteyn Kill and Casperkill in that study. The study also found that the Fonteyn Kill's score on the Hilsenhoff family biotic index (HBI), a scale measuring pollution based on the tolerance of endemic benthic macroinvertebrates, was approximately six, indicating fairly poor water quality, with scores {{for the rest of the}} Casperkill–Fonteyn Kill watershed were as <b>high</b> <b>as</b> seven (poor water quality) to as low as four (very good water quality).|$|E
5|$|A major restructure of Northeast Seattle service {{occurred}} in 2002 {{to accommodate the}} new Sound Transit Express route 522 from Seattle to Woodinville via the State Route 522 corridor.

5|$|A rare but {{important}} terrain feature {{found in the}} abyssal and hadal zones is the hydrothermal vent. In contrast to the approximately 2°C ambient water temperature at these depths, water emerges from these vents at temperatures ranging from 60°C up to as <b>high</b> <b>as</b> 464°C. Due to the high barometric pressure at these depths, water may exist in either its liquid form or as a supercritical fluid at such temperatures.|$|E

5|$|A similar {{source of}} funds {{was to be the}} tax on exports of cotton. However, in {{addition}} to the difficulties associated with the blockade, the self-imposed embargo on cotton meant that for all practical purposes the tax was completely ineffective as a fund raiser.

5|$|An {{area was}} set aside within {{the grounds for}} athletics, aptly named the Tower Athletic Ground.
