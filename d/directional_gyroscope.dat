50|$|The Alcyon was a {{successful}} trainer, capable of basic aerobatic maneuvers. It was often used in replacement of pre-war vintage Stampe SV.4 biplanes. Several civilian flying schools, including Air France, used the Alcyon. For the time, it was well equipped with full IFR equipment: two VOR-ILS sets, one ADF set, two VHF radios, a radar altimeter, an attitude indicator, and a <b>directional</b> <b>gyroscope.</b> For this reason, it was often used for navigation training as it was far cheaper to operate than the twin-engine designs commonly used for that task.|$|E
5000|$|In 1929, {{he became}} the first pilot to take off, fly and land an {{airplane}} using instruments alone, without a view outside the cockpit. Having returned to Mitchel Field that September, he assisted in the development of fog flying equipment. He helped develop, and was then the first to test, the now universally used artificial horizon and <b>directional</b> <b>gyroscope.</b> He attracted wide newspaper attention with this feat of [...] "blind" [...] flying and later received the Harmon Trophy for conducting the experiments. These accomplishments made all-weather airline operations practical.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{development}} of a flux-gate magnetic heading reference using a single-chip microcomputer to process heading information and to present it to the pilot in appropriate form. This instrument is intended to replace the conventional combination of mechanical compass and <b>directional</b> <b>gyroscope</b> currently in use in general aviation aircraft, at appreciable savings in cost and reduction in maintenance. Design of the sensing element, the signal processing electronics, and the computer algorithms which calculate the magnetic heading of the aircraft from the magnetometer data have been integrated {{in such a way as}} to minimize hardware requirements and simplify calibration procedures. Damping and deviation errors are avoided by the inherent design of the device, and a technique for compensating for northerly-turning-error is described...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines {{seeks to}} {{increase}} safety and efficiency in U. S. coal mines. One {{approach is to}} develop technology for automation of a continuous mining machine. Realization of an autonomous mining machine requires development of subsystems for machine intelligence, navigation-positioning, and computer control. This report focuses on investigation of one subsystem, an onboard heading system, which {{would be responsible for}} determining and controlling machine heading. The onboard heading system investigated is a multisensor system to determine machine heading, pitch, and roll. A <b>directional</b> <b>gyroscope</b> provides heading (yaw), fluxgate sensors provide a compass heading, and gravity-referenced clinometers give machine pitch and roll. The system utilizes a dedicated microcontroller networked to an external system of computers. Tram commands, supplied to the network from external computers, are executed by the onboard system. Sensor feedback is employed for closed-loop control of machine heading by controlling pivots and turns. The report discusses operating limitations and error sources of system sensors and presents test results of closed-loop control of machine heading. Results of tests with a mining machine are used to exhibit various sensor shortcomings and to evaluate control of pivots and turns...|$|E
