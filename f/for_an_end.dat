5|$|During {{the late}} 1820s, Heliade became {{involved}} in cultural policies. In 1827, he and Dinicu Golescu founded Soţietatea literară românească (the Romanian Literary Society), which, through its program (mapped out by Heliade himself), proposed Saint Sava's transformation into a college, the opening of another such institution in Craiova, {{and the creation of}} schools in virtually all Wallachian localities. In addition, Soţietatea attempted to encourage the establishment of Romanian-language newspapers, calling <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> to the state monopoly on printing presses.

5|$|In June 1970, Nasser {{accepted}} the US-sponsored Rogers Plan, which called <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> to hostilities and an Israeli withdrawal from Egyptian territory, {{but it was}} rejected by Israel, the PLO, and most Arab states except Jordan.

He also determined that a ceasefire could serve as a tactical step toward the strategic goal of recapturing the Suez Canal. Nasser forestalled any movement toward direct negotiations with Israel. In dozens of speeches and statements, Nasser posited the equation that any direct peace talks with Israel were tantamount to surrender.|$|E
