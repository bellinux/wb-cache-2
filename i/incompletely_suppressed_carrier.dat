Based on {{straightforward}} approximations {{to evaluate}} the error rate with phase jitter in the reconstituted carrier and phase slips in the tracking loop, comparison is made of three schemes for biphase and quadriphase data transmission: 1.

Track on <b>suppressed</b> <b>carrier</b> - retain a carrier component to resolve the inherent ambiguity. For operation at relatively high P(E), as with error correction, schemes 1 and 3 both avoid the inherent degradation of differential encoding; however, both require a relatively narrow band phase tracking loop.

A Costas loop capable of demodulating BPSK signals with data rates up to 1 Msps was designed and constructed and its Doppler tracking performance with respect to a Block 3 receiver was tested at the Telecommunications Development Laboratory (TDL).

25|$|Another {{improvement}} over standard AM is obtained through reduction or {{suppression of the}} carrier component of the modulated spectrum. In Figure 2 this is the spike in between the sidebands; even with full (100%) sine wave modulation, the power in the carrier component is twice that in the sidebands, yet it carries no unique information. Thus {{there is a great}} advantage in efficiency in reducing or totally <b>suppressing</b> the <b>carrier,</b> either in conjunction with elimination of one sideband (single-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission) or with both sidebands remaining (double sideband <b>suppressed</b> <b>carrier).</b> While these <b>suppressed</b> <b>carrier</b> transmissions are efficient in terms of transmitter power, they require more sophisticated receivers employing synchronous detection and regeneration of the carrier frequency. For that reason, standard AM continues to be widely used, especially in broadcast transmission, to allow for the use of inexpensive receivers using envelope detection. Even (analog) television, with a (largely) suppressed lower sideband, includes sufficient carrier power for use of envelope detection. But for communications systems where both transmitters and receivers can be optimized, suppression of both one sideband and the carrier represent a net advantage and are frequently employed.|$|R

These radio losses were {{calculated}} through simulations {{for a range}} of data rates. These simulations included both <b>suppressed</b> <b>carrier</b> modulation and residual carrier modulation cases. The radio losses were calculated for a frame error rate of 3 x 10 ^- 4 for (8920, 1 / 3) and (8920, 1 / 6) codes and 3 frame error rate of 6 x 10 ^- 5 for (1764, 1 / 3) and (1784, 1 / 6) codes. The simulations for the residual carrier case were run for loop signal to noise ratios of 13 dB, 15 dB and 17 dB with a loop bandwidth of 10 Hz. The simulations for the <b>suppressed</b> <b>carrier</b> case were run for a loop of signal to noise ratio of 17 dB. The results of these simulations indicate that the radio losses for turbo codes are low enough to warrant their use in deep space links (maximum of 1 dB loss at 17 dB loop signal to noise ratio for residual carrier and 1. 3 dB loss at 17 dB loop signal to noise ratio for <b>suppressed</b> <b>carrier</b> at high data rates). Furthermore, these results indicate that by normalizing the radio losses for frame size, loop bandwidth and the loop signal to noise ratio, a single curve could be used for calculating the radio loss for any given data rate at any given loop signal to noise ratio...|$|R

The transmission system performance was carefully analyzed by considering optical amplifier noise, fiber nonlinearity, phase noise, frequency response, and analog-to-digital converter (ADC) quantization noise. The 18 -GHz, 16 -QAM signal can be radiated from the base station to a remote antenna port without any upcon-verter, and the remote antenna port consists of a downconverter and high-speed digital signal processors (DSPs) to recover the 16 -QAM signal. The high-speed DSP, which partially compen-sates the intersymbol-interference (ISI) and phase-noise-induced system penalties, was enabled by 20 -Gs/s ADCs.
