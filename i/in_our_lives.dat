The third truth promises release by developing a realistic self-image, and the fourth truth spells out the means of accomplishing that.|$|E

500|$|Dedicated on July 3, 1935, as the Prospect Park Zoo, the {{buildings}} constituted an integrated facility and {{were seen as}} a great improvement over the somewhat haphazardly developed Menagerie.
