5|$|The {{expedition}} proceeded northwards through Ch'ol {{territory and}} into Mopan territory; there they camped at Mopan town (modern San Luis). Due to {{their fear of}} their warlike Itza neighbours, both the Ch'ol and the Mopans claimed not to <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> paths to Lake Petén Itzá. The Spanish were held up at Mopan for several days by supply problems and desertions among their native carriers. The Dominicans {{took advantage of the}} delay to proselytise the Mopans and Cano wrote that he had converted four caciques (native chiefs) there, although Taxim Chan, king of the Mopans, had fled with many of the local inhabitants. Cano believed that the Mopans were ruled by the king of the Itzas.|$|E

This is a two-cell, all metal flashlight, both ends of which are painted red. Three rivets hold the head of the flashlight to the body of the light. There has been only a limited number of these lights sold in this area. If you have owned or <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> one who owned one of these lights, report at once to Sheriff W. E.

25|$|Sagan wrote {{frequently}} {{about religion}} {{and the relationship between}} religion and science, expressing his skepticism about the conventional conceptualization of God as a sapient being. For example: Some people think God is an outsized, light-skinned male with a long white beard, sitting on a throne somewhere up there in the sky, busily tallying the fall of every sparrow. Others—for example Baruch Spinoza and Albert Einstein—considered God to be essentially the sum total of the physical laws which describe the universe. I do not <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> compelling evidence for anthropomorphic patriarchs controlling human destiny from some hidden celestial vantage point, but it would be madness to deny the existence of physical laws.|$|E

25|$|The western room (called {{the parlor}} or the dining room) was a public, ornately {{decorated}} room. The walls are painted a yellow ocher, and the woodwork is Chinese-style. The {{wall of the}} fireplace has a mantel decorated with fretwork, pagoda-like scalloped moldings, as well as canopies topped by pine cone finials. Above the doors are similar canopies, which might have displayed Chinese porcelain vases or ceramic figures. The two long windows are topped by scalloped pediments, decorated with fretwork. During Mason's lifetime, three of the walls were probably wallpapered. During the 18th century, chinoese (Chinese-style) design was popular in Great Britain, however the Gunston Hall museum does not <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> other rooms in colonial America {{with this type of}} coordinated chinoiserie woodwork.|$|E
25|$|People {{also claimed}} that the Indians were not the Mound Builders because the mounds and related {{artifacts}} were older than Indian cultures. Caleb Atwater's misunderstanding of stratigraphy caused him {{to believe that the}} Mound Builders were a much older civilization than the Indians. In his book, Antiquities Discovered in the Western States (1820), Atwater claimed that Indian remains were always found right {{beneath the surface of the}} earth. Since the artifacts associated with the Mound Builders were found fairly deep in the ground, Atwater argued that they must be from a different group of people. The discovery of metal artifacts further convinced people that the Mound Builders were not Native Americans. The Indians encountered by the Europeans and Americans were not thought to engage in metallurgy. Some artifacts that were found in relation to the mounds were inscribed with symbols. As the Europeans did not <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> Indian cultures that had a writing system, they assumed a different group had created them.|$|E
500|$|This {{project is}} not the only one of its nature to fail; Indonesia and Malaysia mounted {{enormous}} tire-reef programs in the 1980s and are now seeing the ramifications of the failure of tire reefs, from littered beaches to reef destruction. Jack Sobel, The Ocean Conservancy's director of strategic conservation said in a 2002 interview that [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> cases where there's been a success with tire reefs." [...] That year, The Ocean Conservancy's International Coastal Cleanup removed 11,956 tires from beaches all over the world.|$|E

500|$|Harald also {{continued}} to advance Christianity in Norway, and archaeological excavations show that churches were built and improved during his reign. He also imported bishops, priests and monks from abroad, especially from Kievan Rus' and the Byzantine Empire. A slightly different form of Christianity was thus introduced in Norway {{from the rest}} of northern Europe, although {{it should be noted that}} the East–West Schism had not yet taken place. Since the clergy was not ordained in England or France, it nonetheless caused controversy when Harald was visited by papal legates. The protests by the legates led Harald to throw the Catholic clergy out of his court, and he reportedly stated to the legates that [...] "he did not <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> other archbishop or lord of Norway than the king himself". Norwegian historian Halvdan Koht has remarked that the [...] "words seemed as if spoken by a Byzantine despot". It is possible that Harald maintained contacts with Byzantine emperors after he became king, which could suggest a background for his church policies.|$|E
500|$|Barbauld also {{collaborated with}} her brother John Aikin on the six-volume series Evenings at Home (1793). It is a {{miscellany}} of stories, fables, dramas, poems, and dialogues. In many ways this series encapsulates the ideals of an Enlightenment education: [...] "curiosity, observation, and reasoning." [...] For example, the stories encourage learning science through hands-on activities; in [...] "A Tea Lecture" [...] the child learns that tea-making is [...] "properly an operation of chemistry" [...] and lessons on evaporation, and condensation follow. The text also emphasises rationality; in [...] "Things by Their Right Names," [...] a child demands that his father tell him a story about [...] "a bloody murder." [...] The father does so, {{using some of the}} fictional tropes of fairy tales such as [...] "once upon a time", but confounding his son with details, such as the murderers all [...] "had steel caps on." [...] In the end the child realises his father has told him the story of a battle, and his father comments [...] "I do not <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> murders half so bloody." [...] Both the tactic of defamiliarising the world to force the reader to think about it rationally and the anti-war message of this tale are prevalent throughout Evenings at Home. In fact, Michelle Levy, a scholar of the period, has argued that the series encouraged readers to [...] "become critical observers of and, where necessary, vocal resisters to authority." [...] This resistance is learned and practised in the home; according to Levy, [...] "Evenings at Home ... makes the claim that social and political reform must begin in the family." [...] It is families that are responsible for the nation's progress or regress.|$|E

2500|$|The New Mexico Environmental Improvement Division {{said the}} spill's [...] "short-term and {{long-term}} impacts on {{people and the}} environment were quite limited." [...] United Nuclear denied claims that the spill caused livestock deaths.

2500|$|Tocqueville {{said that}} those with the most {{education}} and intelligence were left with two choices. They could join limited intellectual circles to explore the weighty and complex problems facing society, or they could use their superior talents to amass vast fortunes in the private sector. Tocqueville wrote {{that he did not}} <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> country where there was [...] "less independence of mind, and true freedom of discussion, than in America".|$|E
2500|$|Later, in September 1857, Young said in {{a private}} meeting of the church leadership,: [...] "the world accuse !(sic) me of {{controlling}} the affairs of Calafornia (sic) & kansas (sic) [...] The people do {{believe that we have}} a Band Called the Danites but how Could they exist so long without shedding Blood?

50|$|Around 1100, Folke the Fat {{became the}} first known Bjelbo jarl, and {{probably}} the first jarl of all Sweden, under king Inge I of Sweden. He {{was married to a}} daughter of king Canute IV of Denmark. According to legends, he was the first of his family so elevated. Nothing is <b>known</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> Folke's collateral relatives, though it is well-established that several of his sons' descendants were important lords.|$|R
2500|$|When {{asked if}} such a minyan would be granted {{membership}} in the Orthodox Union, the union's professional head, Rabbi Tzvi Hersh Weinreb, said that the matter would be referred to outside religious authorities, including the Rabbinical Council of America. The RCA's executive vice president, Rabbi Stephen Dworken, {{said that if the}} issue is ever raised, his organization would have to study it. Dworken added that he did not <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> [...] "halachic authority who permits those types of activities." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "A Visit at Loma Linda.

I might say, {{it is one thing}} to read about it, and another thing to visit it, and to see for yourself. For three weeks it was my privilege to visit there. Loma Linda is certainly in keeping with what its name implies--Hill Beautiful. It is located in an ideal spot, and, in my opinion, is as pretty as pictured. To receive a training there must be deemed a privilege. The advantages and opportunities are excellent, and come up to one's expectations.|$|E
2500|$|After the Time War, the Doctor is {{convinced}} {{that he is the}} only surviving Time Lord, saying that he would <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> others if they had survived. The last words of the Face of Boe were [...] "You Are Not Alone". The cryptic statement is explained when the Doctor encounters a man named Professor Yana who is revealed to be the Master. The Master had been hiding in human form {{at the end of the}} universe using a Chameleon Arch, having escaped the destruction of both the Time Lords and the Daleks. By taking human form, he avoided detection by the Doctor, who was unaware of his nemesis' resurrection during the Time War in the first place.|$|E
