40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new framework for tackling constraints over the floating-point numbers. An important application area where such solvers are required is program analysis (e. g., structural test case generation, correctness proof of numeric operations). Albeit the floating-point numbers are a finite {{subset of the}} real numbers, classical CSP techniques are ine ective due to the huge size of the domains. Relations that <b>hold</b> <b>over</b> the real numbers may not <b>hold</b> <b>over</b> the floating-point numbers. Moreover, constraints that have no solutions over the reals may <b>hold</b> <b>over</b> the floats. Thus, interval-narrowing techniques, which are used in numeric CSP, cannot safely solve constraints systems over the floats...|$|R
