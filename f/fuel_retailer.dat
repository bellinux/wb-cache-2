40|$|Includes bibliographical references. In South Africa, as {{with the}} rest of the world, {{pollution}} presents a major threat to the environment and thus to the intimately linked social and economic facets of society. The very notion of sustainability is premised on the inextricability of socio-economic demands and the capacity of the environment to support and sustain such demands. It is trite that without a healthy environment there is no future but if there is a future, then access to ecosystem services in it will become an increasingly critical factor for economic resilience and success. Prevention of pollution is thus of critical importance. The focus of this thesis is on one form of pollution in particular, namely, pollution resulting from petrochemicals leaking from underground storage tanks (“USTs”) situated at <b>fuel</b> <b>retailer</b> outlets and truck stops. These hazardous substances can contaminate nearby groundwater and soil causing a multitude of problems including the contamination and degradation of water and soil in the surrounding areas. Although these tanks constitute potentially devastating environmental hazards, the problem is easily addressed through proper regulation and governance and the adoption of practical guidelines informed by countries with the relevant knowledge and expertise. The South African government has the power to mitigate against and prevent this kind of harm through coordinated policies, integrated management and sound financial planning. In the concluding chapter on this study, recommendations for the drafting and implementation of such measures will be provided...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{importance}} of network effects in the demand for ethanol-compatible vehicles and the supply of ethanol fuel retailers. An indirect network effect, or positive feedback loop, arises in this context due to spatially-dependent complementarities in the availability of ethanol fuel and the installed base of ethanol-compatible vehicles. Marketers and social planners are interested in whether these effects exist, and if so, how policy might accelerate adoption of the ethanol fuel standard within a targeted population. To measure these feedback effects, I develop an econometric framework that considers the simultaneous determination of ethanol-compatible vehicle demand and ethanol fuel supply in local markets. The demand-side of the model considers the automobile purchase decisions of consumers and fleet operators, and the supply-side model considers the ethanol market entry decisions of competing fuel retailers. I propose new estimators that address the endogeneity induced by the co-determination of alternative fuel vehicle demand and alternative fuel supply. I estimate the model using zip code level panel data from six states over a six year period. I find the network effect to be highly signifi cant, both statistically and economically. Under typical market conditions, entry of an additional ethanol <b>fuel</b> <b>retailer</b> leads to a 12 % increase in consumer demand for ethanol-compatible vehicles. The entry model estimates imply that a monopolist requires a local installed base of at least 204 ethanol-compatible vehicles to be pro table. As an application, I demonstrate how the model estimates can inform the promotional strategy of a vehicle manufacturer. Counter-factual simulations indicate that subsidizing fuel retailers to offer ethanol {{can be an effective}} policy to indirectly increase ethanol-compatible vehicle sales. ...|$|E

40|$|Today, 10 {{percent of}} the U. S. {{gasoline}} supply is provided by renewable fuel, primarily ethanol. Increasing the use of renewable fuel, which is more sustainable and less polluting than gasoline, will require the greater adoption of higher ethanol blends in the transportation fuel supply. While electrification of the light-duty fleet could achieve the greatest potential reductions in both tailpipe emissions and greenhouse gases (GHG), the lifecycle of the vehicle fleet and market realities suggest that {{the internal combustion engine}} will continue to dominate the light-duty fleet for several decades. The transportation sector currently accounts for 27 percent of U. S. GHG emissions. To address rising transportation greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and air pollutants, steps are available to immediately reduce emissions from the transportation sector. Greater use of E 15 (15 percent ethanol and 85 percent gasoline), a fuel usable by nearly 90 percent of cars on the road today, is one such step. Additionally, utilizing mid-level ethanol blends (E 25 to E 40) in the near future will optimize the cleaner, more fuel-efficient internal combustion engines being produced by automotive manufacturers. The retail gasoline market has seen a marked uptick in sales and interest in E 15 in the past few years, thanks to a combination of private-public partnerships and competitive pricing of E 15 relative to other fuels. E 15 offers drivers an improvement in emissions, price and performance over regular E 10. However, with rising interest in E 15, gasoline marketers and the ethanol industry have run into an obscure piece of air quality regulation—Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) standards—that inadvertently block the year-round sale of E 15. A bill in Congress, the Consumer and <b>Fuel</b> <b>Retailer</b> Choice Act (S. 517, H. R. 1311), would amend the Clean Air Act to allow for the year-round sale of E 15...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (PhD.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2007. The {{impact of}} change and {{transformation}} on small businesses has compelled them to face a multitude of new challenges. The successful application of the selected strategies depends largely on {{an understanding of the}} predisposing and prevailing business dynamics and variables that impacts on their profitability, continued sustainability and future growth. There is increased attention that is focused on the turnover factor of small business in South Africa and this gives added need for extensive qualitative and quantitative analysis. International experience suggests that small businesses are a pervasive feature of the economic landscape in the developed world. The intensity and growing proportions of small business failure in South Africa is alarming. The problem not only presents management with new dilemmas, but also presents a challenge to researchers who are faced with the task of identifying through rational and scientifically valid processes, the underlying causes of the high failure rate amongst small businesses. Previous studies suggest that government regulations and franchised business have proven to be successful due to the infrastructure support offered by the franchisor. Since retail service station dealers operate within a highly regulated industry and within a franchised environment, this study examines the reasons for failure and success within the Retail Fuel Industry sector in South Africa. It was anticipated {{that there are a number}} of factors that influence success and failure from both within and outside the control of the fuel entrepreneur. While some researchers have identified gender, education levels and age as critical success factors, others suggested that management factors and occupational experience are key drivers. The fuel retail industry is regulated and seeks to reward efficiency through a retail fuel margin. This study provides new insights and important clues concerning the failure amongst fuel retailers. The closure of the business did not result in the physical disappearance of the establishment but rather in a transfer to new ownership. The purpose of this study is to conduct a more in-depth and comprehensive qualitative research using the case study methodology, which will investigate the causal factors that lead to the high mortality rate of fuel retailers in South Africa. The non-fuel aspect of the business comprises the shops and quick service restaurants and presents another dynamic to fuel retailing. This was investigated to fully address the research question. The case study analysis also attempted to quantify the level of support that franchisees received. There was sufficient evidence from the research findings to nullify the rival proposition that success and failure of fuel retailers was only a function of sales and volume. The case study evidence supported the research proposition that the reasons for failure and success were due to factors other than size. The 47 % per annum failure rate recorded in the study was attributed to a number of factors from both within and outside the control of the fuel entrepreneur. While gender, education levels and age were not found to be critical success factors, the ability to manage the key components of target costs was critical. The management of manpower costs and the efficient application thereof was found to be the most significant variable in the cost build up and differentiated successful and failed retailers. There was also evidence of substantial imposed costs from both the regulatory environment and the franchisor. The monthly adjustment of fuel prices had an impact on working capital and generally resulted in net stock price losses. Both these variables were not factored into the calculation of the retail fuel margin resulting in the understating of the true costs. The loose regulatory environment also marginalised the <b>fuel</b> <b>retailer.</b> It was found that the oil companies optimised their fuel delivery regimes at the expense of the small business owner through the automatic replenishment system of wet stocks, controlled through a central ordering system. While, wet stock control mechanism was in place for the fuel business, the non-fuel business received limited support for stock and shrinkage management. The case study evidence also supported the retailers view on the inadequate level of business support and training. This was an important finding and such poor orientation negatively influenced the quality of the due diligence checks and business valuation. In many cases, the budgeting was optimistic with little or no recourse for remedial action leading to eventual failure. Statistical analysis indicated that the two groups differed significantly with regard to the mean difference between Shop sales and Budgeted Shop sales. It appears that in the case of the success group that the shop sales mean was much higher than budgeted mean, while in the case of the failure group the mean was lower than budgeted mean. Failure to achieve the shop budgets did contribute to failure. Important recommendations are made based on the case study findings. This includes the establishment of a central training unit, an industry valuation model and a more relevant regulatory regime aimed at removing the imbalances between the oil company and the retailer in terms of delivery and payment methodology...|$|E
