500|$|Rick Florino of Artistdirect gave American Tragedy 5 out of 5, {{particularly}} {{praising the}} band's choice to avoid duplicating their debut album, Swan Songs, and instead choosing to create a, [...] "darker, deeper, and far deadlier ride this time around." [...] Florino compared various {{elements of the}} album to the Wu Tang Clan and Nine Inch Nails, particularly comparing the album's production (which was done by various producers with executive producer Don Gilmore) to Nine Inch Nails' second album The Downward Spiral (1994). He also lauded {{the irony of the}} quality singing on, [...] "Apologize", combined with the lyrics, [...] "But we can harmonize, even if we sound like shit." [...] Florino concluded that, [...] "Hollywood Undead's genius lies—in that dangerous space between unforgettable and unsettling," [...] pointing this out in the track, [...] "Bullet", for it being the, [...] "sunniest and catchiest tune on American Tragedy," [...] while still telling, [...] "a potent and poignant tale of longing for suicide." [...] The other track Florino pointed out for being unforgettable is, [...] "Pour Me", calling it, [...] "an evil power ballad that everyone who <b>hears</b> <b>it</b> will feel." ...|$|E
500|$|Beecham {{had died}} in 1961, and Fenby writes that it [...] "seemed to many then that nothing could save Delius's music from extinction", such was the conductor's unique mastery over the music. However, other {{conductors}} have continued to advocate Delius, and since the centenary year, the Delius Society has pursued the aim of [...] "develop a greater knowledge of the life and works of Delius". [...] The music has never become fashionable, [...] a fact often acknowledged by promoters and critics. To suggestions that Delius's music is an [...] "acquired taste", Fenby answers: [...] "The music of Delius is not an acquired taste. One either likes it the moment one first <b>hears</b> <b>it,</b> or {{the sound of it}} is once and for ever distasteful to one. It is an art which will never enjoy an appeal to the many, but one which will always be loved, and dearly loved, by the few." [...] Writing in 2004 on the 70th anniversary of Delius's death, the Guardian journalist Martin Kettle recalls Cardus arguing in 1934 that Delius as a composer was unique, both in his technique and in his emotionalism. Although he eschewed classical formalism, it was wrong, Cardus believed, to regard Delius merely as [...] "a tone-painter, an impressionist or a maker of programme music". His music's abiding feature is, Cardus wrote, that it [...] "recollects emotion in tranquillity... Delius is always reminding us that beauty is born by contemplation after the event".|$|E

2500|$|Fugal {{passages}} {{are also}} found in the Missa Solemnis and all movements of the Ninth Symphony, except the third one. A massive, dissonant fugue forms the finale of his String Quartet, Op. 130 (1825); the latter was later published separately as Op. 133, the Große Fuge ("Great Fugue"). However, it is the fugue that opens Beethoven's String Quartet in C sharp minor, Op. 131 that several commentators regard as one of the composer's greatest achievements. [...] Joseph Kerman (1966, p.330) calls it [...] "this most moving of all fugues". Sullivan (1927, p.235) <b>hears</b> <b>it</b> as [...] "the most superhuman piece of music that Beethoven has ever written."

2500|$|In the 14th century many Moors and Jews, fleeing {{persecution}} in Spain, migrated {{south to}} the Timbuktu area, at that time part of the Songhai Empire.

Sons of this prominent family founded three villages that still exist near Timbuktu—Kirshamba, Haybomo, and Kongougara. [...] In 1492, Askia Muhammed {{came to power in}} the previously tolerant region of Timbuktu and decreed that Jews must convert to Islam or leave; Judaism became illegal in Mali, as it did in Catholic Spain that same year.

2500|$|Drummers using {{electronic}} drums, drum machines, or hybrid acoustic-electric kits (which blend traditional acoustic {{drums and}} cymbals with electronic pads) typically use a monitor speaker, keyboard amplifier {{or even a}} small PA system to hear the electronic drum sounds. Even a drummer playing entirely acoustic drums may use a monitor speaker to hear her drums, especially if she is playing in a loud rock or metal band, where there is substantial onstage volume from huge, powerful guitar stacks. Since the drum kit uses the deep bass drum, drummers are often given a large speaker cabinet with a 15" [...] subwoofer to help them monitor their bass drum sound (along with a full-range monitor speaker to hear {{the rest of their}} kit). Some sound engineers and drummers prefer to use an electronic vibration system, colloquially known as a [...] "butt shaker" [...] or [...] "throne thumper" [...] to monitor the bass drum, because this lowers the stage volume. With a [...] "butt shaker", the [...] "thump" [...] of each bass drum strike causes a vibration in the drum stool; this way the drummer feels their beat on the posterior, rather than <b>hears</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
