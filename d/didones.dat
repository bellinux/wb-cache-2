50|$|The <b>Didones</b> or modern typefaces {{draw their}} {{name from the}} typefounders Didot and Bodoni. These typefaces, dating {{from the end of}} the 18th and the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, make a very strong contrast between full and connecting strokes (the connecting strokes being extremely fine), the verticality of the characters and their unbracketed, hairline serifs. They correspond to the Didot of the Thibaudeau classification. The <b>didones</b> in particular made it possible for the First French Empire to employ typefaces very different from the typefaces used by the kings from the Ancien Régime.|$|E

An English-language {{adaptation of the}} first of these, the Jocasta by George Gascoigne and Francis Kinwelmersh, was staged in 1566 at Gray's Inn in London. His tragedy <b>Didone</b> (1547) was one of his more influential tragedies in Italy, a precursor of Pietro Metastasio's <b>Didone</b> abbandonata (1724).|$|R

50|$|Among popular {{faces in}} modern use, the {{typeface}} family Century {{is inspired by}} later American <b>Didone</b> designs, although compared to many in the <b>Didone</b> genre it has quite {{a low level of}} stroke contrast, suitably for its purpose of high legibility in body text. Typefaces of the period have often been revived since for cold type and digital composition, while modern typefaces along the same lines include Filosofia and the open-source Computer Modern. Some later <b>Didone</b> families have focused on subgenres of the period, such as Surveyor, inspired by labels on maps, and Morris Fuller Benton's Ultra Bodoni and Matthew Carter's Elephant, reinterpretations of 'fat face' designs.|$|R

50|$|The {{effective}} use of digital <b>Didone</b> typefaces poses unique challenges. While they can look very elegant due to their regular, rational design and fine strokes, a known effect on readers is 'dazzle', where the thick verticals draw the reader's attention and cause them to struggle {{to concentrate on the}} other, much thinner strokes that define which letter is which. For this reason, using the right optical size of digital font has been described as particularly essential with <b>Didone</b> designs. Fonts to be used at text sizes will be sturdier designs with thicker 'thin' strokes and serifs (less stroke contrast) and more space between letters than on display designs, to increase legibility. Optical sizes were a natural requirement of printing technology at the time of <b>Didone</b> typefaces' first creation in metal type, since each size of metal type would be custom-cut, but declined as the pantograph, phototypesetting and digital fonts made printing the same font at any size simpler; a revival has taken place in recent years. French designer Loïc Sander has suggested that the dazzle effect may be particularly common in designs produced in countries where designers are unfamiliar with how to use them effectively and may choose <b>Didone</b> fonts designed for headings. Many modern <b>Didone</b> digital revivals intended for professional printing, such as Parmagiano, ITC Bodoni and Hoefler & Frere-Jones' Didot and Surveyor, have a range of optical sizes, but this is less common on default computer fonts. Among default <b>Didone</b> fonts on computer systems, Century Schoolbook on Windows is oriented towards body text use, while the Didot revival on OS X was specifically intended for display use and not for body text.|$|R
