50|$|FDOA-FDOA {{geolocation}} {{is accomplished}} by using three satellites, or by using time separated measurements on two satellites. The time separation can {{be as little as}} 5 minutes or as much as an hour or more. Again, the two FDOA lines are used to find a crossing point, or target location. FDOA-FDOA geolocation is necessary for CW signals. Geolocation on highly inclined satellites, either one of both being used in the measurement, will result in more accurate results by performing FDOA - FDOA geolocation. This is due to a large difference in relative motion, leading to a large difference in relative frequency between the two satellites. A related point is the error to FDOA-FDOA calculation contributed by ephemeris uncertainty is relatively small. Moving targets {{are not likely to be}} located using FDOA methods, unless using a highly inclined satellite. FDOA - FDOA geolocation has an interesting weakness in that for some amount of time per day, the two satellites used have very little <b>differential</b> <b>frequency.</b> This is due to the cyclical movement of the satellites. During those periods, FDOA measurements will not be ideal. In addition, the small amount of frequency difference being measured is much harder to accurately measure than the time differences.|$|E
50|$|Many {{communication}} satellites share a given frequency band. As a signal is transmitted {{to a particular}} satellite there is some amount of side lobe or spillover energy that is transmitted to adjacent satellites. At a receive station that has two antennas, one pointed at the primary satellite (the satellite the signal is intended for) and a secondary satellite (a satellite that is receiving side lobe energy), both paths of the signal are received and measured. From a comparison of those paths, two measurements can be made: Differential Time Offset (DTO) and <b>Differential</b> <b>Frequency</b> Offset (DFO). These measurements are often implemented through correlation processing. DTO represents the difference in time that it takes the signal to travel through the two satellites, while DFO represents the difference in frequency the received signals present through the two satellites. The frequency differences observed are due to different Doppler shift resulting from relative satellite motion and differences in the translation frequencies of the two satellite channels. Channel translation frequencies and downlink Doppler shift and delay can be calibrated out of the measurements by observing transmitters of known location simultaneously on the channels. This leaves the uplink DTO and DFO as the observables. See 'Reference Signals' below.|$|E

For each of the 30 participants, two mentoring dialogues were analyzed: one before and one after they were trained in supervisory skills. To capture the frequency of reflective moments, the stimulated recall technique and a specially developed push-button device were combined in a two-method approach. The data of the study suggest the existence of different levels of consciousness in acquiring and using supervisory skills, the possibility of measuring reflectivity using concurrent and retrospective methods simultaneously, and the potential of such measurements to inform and improve professional development opportunities for mentor teachers. © 2010 Taylor & Francis...|$|R

Copy number {{variations}} (CNVs) are {{one form of}} human genetic variations that have been linked with complex diseases and often occur at different frequencies among African Americans and Caucasian populations. Here, we aimed to investigate whether CNVs with <b>differential</b> <b>frequencies</b> can contribute to health disparities {{from the perspective of}} gene networks. We inferred network clusters from human gene/protein networks based on two different data sources. We then evaluated each network cluster for the occurrences of known pathogenic genes and genes located in CNVs with different population frequencies, and used false discovery rates to rank network clusters. This approach let us identify five clusters enriched with known pathogenic genes and with genes located in CNVs with different frequencies between African Americans and Caucasians. These clustering patterns predict two candidate causal genes located in four population-specific CNVs that play potential roles in health disparitie...|$|R
40|$|Hemispheric asymmetries in the {{perception}} of local and global features have been consistently reported: there is an advantage for responses to global features in the left visual field/right hemisphere and an advantage for responses to local features in the right visual field/left hemisphere. It has been proposed that this asymmetry originates from <b>differential</b> <b>frequency</b> bias in the two hemispheres (e. g., Ivry & Robertson, 1998). Nevertheless, there is little evidence supporting hemispheric specialization for particular frequency ranges (e. g., Fendrich & Gazzaniga, 1990) or <b>differential</b> <b>frequency</b> tuning in the neurons in the two hemispheres. Here we test the hypothesis that this hemispheric asymmetry in visual perception takes place at the encoding stage beyond the sensory level. We use two autoencoder networks with differential connectivity configurations as the way to develop differential encoding in the two hemispheres, to reflect the anatomical evidence that there is more interconnectivity among the neighboring cortical columns in the right hemisphere than the left hemisphere (e. g. Hutsler & Galuske, 2003). We show that this differential encoding mechanism has a better fit with human data than the model based on <b>differential</b> <b>frequency</b> bias, and thus is a more anatomically realistic and cognitively plausible model in accounting for the hemispheric asymmetry in visual perception...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} spectrally efficient <b>differential</b> <b>frequency</b> hopping (DFH) system design. Relying on time-frequency diversity {{over large}} spectrum and high speed frequency hopping, DFH systems are robust against hostile jamming interference. However, the spectral efficiency of conventional DFH systems {{is very low}} due to only using the frequency of each channel. To improve the system capacity, in this paper, we propose an innovative high order <b>differential</b> <b>frequency</b> hopping (HODFH) scheme. Unlike in traditional DFH where the message is carried by the frequency relationship between the adjacent hops using one order differential coding, in HODFH, the message is carried by the frequency and phase relationship using two-order or higher order differential coding. As a result, system efficiency is increased significantly since the additional information transmission is achieved by the higher order differential coding {{at no extra cost}} on either bandwidth or power. Quantitative performance analysis on the proposed scheme demonstrates that transmission through the frequency and phase relationship using two-order or higher order differential coding essentially introduces another dimension to the signal space, and the corresponding coding gain can increase the system efficiency...|$|E

40|$|In {{high power}} ICRF {{experiments}} on the GAMMA 10 tandem mirror, plasmas {{with a strong}} temperature anisotropy are produced when the cyclotron resonance layer exists near the midplane of the central cell. Saturation of the diamagnetism is sometimes observed when the heating ICRF power is increased. In the plasmas with the strong temperature anisotropy, Alfvén-ion-cyclotron (AIC) modes are spontaneously excited. Low frequency (LF) waves which have <b>differential</b> <b>frequencies</b> between the heating ICRF waves (6. 36 MHz) and the AIC modes (5. 5 – 6. 0 MHz) are also detected. At the midplane of the central cell, azimuthal mode structures are measured and the heating ICRF waves of m = + 2, the AIC modes of m =- 1 or 0 and the LF modes from m =- 2 to m = + 2 are detected. These experimental observations suggest the heating ICRF waves with several azimuthal mode numbers branch into the AIC modes and the LF waves. Although axial mode structures are also measured, {{it has not yet}} been confirmed that they satisfy the matching conditions. A possibility of the parametric decay of the heating ICRF waves to the AIC modes and the LF waves is discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{functional}} and social {{meanings of the}} formal variants of the expressions I DON‟T KNOW and I DON‟T THINK. The qualitative {{analysis of the data}} shows that I DON‟T KNOW and I DON‟T THINK are highly routinized discourse formulae that perform multiple interpersonal and textual functions. The quantification of their phonetic and grammatical variants across function, age and gender reveals that the occurrence of non-localised and localised variants of I DON‟T KNOW and I DON‟T THINK is conditioned by different parameters. Non-localised variants show function-specific patterning: variants of I DON‟T KNOW pattern with broad functional categories; variants of I DON‟T THINK reflect fine-grained functional differences at a micro-level of analysis. Localised variants, by contrast, do not carry a functional load but evince orderly social heterogeneity. The results demonstrate that social variation in discourse extends beyond <b>differential</b> <b>frequencies</b> and strategic uses of discourse markers (DMs) to their formal encoding, and that function {{plays an important role in}} accounting for patterns of formal variation in discourse. The paper argues for a fuller integration of qualitative methods in the study of language variation and change in discourse, and calls for the form and function of discourse variables to be studied in greater detail...|$|R

Various studies have identified a number of human genes in association with leprosy or its clinical forms. However, non-replication of results has hinted at the heterogeneity among associations between different population groups, which could be due to differently evolved LD structures and <b>differential</b> <b>frequencies</b> of SNPs within the studied regions of the genome. A need for systematic and saturated mapping of the associated regions with the disease is warranted to unravel the observed heterogeneity in different populations. Mapping of the PARK 2 and PACRG gene regulatory region with 96 SNPs, with a resolution of 1 SNP per 1 Kb for PARK 2 gene regulatory region in a North Indian population, showed an involvement of 11 SNPs in determining the susceptibility towards leprosy. The association was replicated in a geographically distinct and unrelated population from Orissa in eastern India. In vitro reporter assays revealed that the two significantly associated SNPs, located 63. 8 kb upstream of PARK 2 gene and represented in a single BIN of 8 SNPs, influenced the gene expression.

Methylation ratios of six genes (DAPK, TWIST, HIN- 1, RASSF 1 A, RARbeta 2 and APC) were measured in benign breast tissues (n = 9) and in tumor samples from non-IBC (n = 81) and IBC (n = 19) patients using quantitative methylation-specific PCR. Median methylation ratios observed in breast cancer (n = 100) were significantly higher than those observed in benign breast tissues for five of six genes (TWIST, HIN- 1, RASSF 1 A, RARbeta 2 and APC). Only one of the individual genes studied, RARbeta 2, showed differential methylation ratios in IBC and non-IBC (p = 0. 016). Using the maximal methylation ratio observed in benign breast tissue as a threshold, the methylation frequency of two genes, RARbeta 2 and APC, was significantly increased in IBC (n = 19) when compared to non-IBC (n = 81) : 53 vs. 23 % for RARbeta 2 (p = 0. 012) and 84 vs. 54 % for APC (p = 0. 017). Using hierarchical clustering, methylation patterns could not classify breast cancers according to their phenotype.
