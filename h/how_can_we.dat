Is there a world, completely separate from our physical one, that is occupied by the mathematical entities? <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>we</b> gain access to this separate world and discover truths about the entities?

25|$|Read on its own, the First Meditation {{can be seen}} as {{presenting}} skeptical doubts as {{a subject}} of study in their own right. Certainly, skepticism is a much discussed and hotly debated topic in philosophy, even today. Descartes raised the mystifying question of how we can claim to know with certainty anything about the world around us. The idea is not that these doubts are probable, but that their possibility can never be entirely ruled out. And if we can never be certain, <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>we</b> claim to know anything? Skepticism cuts straight {{to the heart of the}} Western philosophical enterprise and its attempt to provide a certain foundation for our knowledge and understanding of the world. It can even be pushed so far as to be read as a challenge to our very notion of rationality.|$|E

[...] Weisman and Winninger also stressed the social nature of the game. Winninger, comparing Golem Arcana to Skylanders, another game with both physical and digital components, stressed that Golem Arcana was less focused on components and more focused on the social experience. Weisman pointed to his disappointment that [...] "kids' idea of playing together after school these days usually means just meeting online from their own houses" [...] in stressing that participants playing {{against each other in}} Golem Arcana would do so face-to-face.|$|E

500|$|Emmy Award winner Terence Winter, who {{had served}} as {{executive}} producer and writer on the critically acclaimed HBO series The Sopranos, was hired to adapt the novel Boardwalk Empire: The Birth, High Times, and Corruption of Atlantic City on June 4, 2008. Winter had been interested in creating a series set in the 1920s, feeling that it had never properly been explored before.

On September 1, 2009, it was announced that Academy Award-winning director Martin Scorsese would direct the pilot. It would be {{the first time he had}} directed an episode of television since an episode of Steven Spielberg's Amazing Stories in 1986. The production would be very ambitious, with some even speculating it would be too large scale for television. [...] "I kept thinking 'This is pointless. <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>we</b> possibly afford a boardwalk, or an empire? says creator Terence Winter. [...] "We can't call it 'Boardwalk Empire' and not see a boardwalk." [...] The production would eventually build a [...] boardwalk in an empty lot in Brooklyn, New York at the cost of five million dollars.

500|$|The LDS Church {{defended the}} {{legitimacy}} of the book by contending that these scholars' methods were faulty. Perhaps most notably, LDS apologists argued that, because many of the Egyptian experts had claimed that the facsimiles were reminiscent of similar documents, or that certain areas on the facsimiles appeared different from known funerary texts, these scholars were merely ignoring potentially key differences in the facsimiles so that their arguments might seem effective. Such a line of reasoning is exemplified by a note written by Church historian B. H. Roberts: [...] "Yes, or some other change might be suggested, and by such a process some other meaning may be read into the place and make it different from the translation of Joseph Smith." [...] The Church eventually hired one Robert C. Webb (the pen name of J. E. Homans), to defend the veracity of the Book of Abraham. In his 1915 work The Case Against Mormonism (in which he claimed to have a PhD, despite this being a deception), he collected several interpretations of Facsimile No. 1 from Egyptologists that sounded unrelated to the layperson (i.e. that the facsimile represented: [...] "an embalming", [...] "the Resurrection of Osiris", or [...] "Anubis guarding the embalmed mummy") and claimed: [...] "If any of these Egyptologists is right, therefore, this drawing must have been radically altered in several essential particulars.

Otherwise, <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>we</b> condemn Joseph Smith for 'fraud' ?" ...|$|E
