Mask consists of three entities: a Content Publisher, Users referred to as Subscribers, and Identity Providers that issue certified <b>identity</b> <b>attributes.</b> The content publisher specifies access control policies against <b>identity</b> <b>attributes</b> of subscribers indicating which conditions the <b>identity</b> <b>attributes</b> of a subscriber must verify in order for this subscriber to access a document or a subdocument. The main novelty of Mask is that, even though the publisher is able to match the <b>identity</b> <b>attributes</b> of the subscribers against its own access control policies, the publisher does not learn the values of the <b>identity</b> <b>attributes</b> of the subscribers; the privacy of the authorized subscribers is thus preserved. Based on the specified access control policies, documents are divided into subdocuments and the subdocuments having different access control policies are encrypted with different keys. Subscribers derive the keys corresponding to the subdocuments they are authorized to access. Key distribution in Mask is supported by a novel group key management protocol by which subscribers can reconstruct the decryption keys from the subscription information they receive from the publisher. The publisher however does not learn which decryption keys each subscriber is able to reconstruct. In this demonstration, we show our system using a healthcare scenario...|$|R

This is referred to as federated identity management. In this paper we develop an approach to support privacy controlled sharing of <b>identity</b> <b>attributes</b> and harmonization of privacy policies in federated environments. Policy harmonizations mechanisms make it possible to determine whether or not the transfer of <b>identity</b> <b>attributes</b> from one entity to another violate the privacy policies stated by the former. We also provide mechanisms for tracing the release of user’s <b>identity</b> <b>attributes</b> within the federation. Such approach entails a form of accountability since an entity non-compliant with the users original privacy preferences can be identified. Finally, a comprehensive security analysis details security properties is also offered. ...|$|R

In particular, it is important that during the execution of a business process the component services be able to verify the identity of the client to check that it has the required permissions for accessing the services.

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel scheme for {{selective}} distribution of content, encoded as documents, that preserves {{the privacy of}} the users to whom the documents are delivered and is based on an efficient and novel group key management scheme. Our document broadcasting approach is based on access control policies specifying which users can access which documents, or subdocuments. Based on such policies, a broadcast document is segmented into multiple subdocuments, each encrypted with a different key. In line with modern attribute-based access control, policies are specified against <b>identity</b> <b>attributes</b> of users. However our broadcasting approach is privacy-preserving in that users are granted access to a specific document, or subdocument, according to the policies without the need of providing in clear information about their <b>identity</b> <b>attributes</b> to the document publisher. Under our approach, not only does the document publisher not learn the values of the <b>identity</b> <b>attributes</b> of users, but it also does not learn which policy conditions are verified by which users, thus inferences about the values of <b>identity</b> <b>attributes</b> are prevented. Moreover, our key management scheme on which the proposed broadcasting approach is based is efficient in that it does not require to send the decryption keys to the users along with the encrypted document. Users are able to reconstruct the keys to decrypt the authorized portions of a document based on subscription information they have received from the document publisher. The scheme also efficiently handles new subscription of users and revocation of subscriptions. Please note that this is an improved and extended version of our previous report [1]...|$|R

Three types of turnaround strategies are possible based on the congruency of the turnaround actions with organizational identity - identity congruent, identity conflicting and identity transforming turnaround strategies.

This is {{so much so that}} the most popular of these devices, the smart phone, in all its varied ubiquitous manifestations is nowadays the de facto personal mobile computing platform, be it for civil or even military applications. In parallel with these developments, Internet application providers like Google and Facebook are developing and deploying an ever increasing set of personal services that are being aggregated and structured over personal user accounts were an ever increasing set of personal private sensitive attributes is being massively aggregated. In this paper we describe OFELIA (Open Federated Environment for Leveraging of Identity and Authorization), a framework for user centric identity management that provides an identity/authorization versatile infrastructure that does not depend upon the massive aggregation of users <b>identity</b> <b>attributes</b> to offer a versatile set of identity services. In OFELIA personal attributes are distributed among and protected by several otherwise unrelated AAs (Attribute Authorities). Only the user mobile device knows how to aggregate these scattered AAs <b>identity</b> <b>attributes</b> back into some useful identifiable entity identity. Moreover by recurring to an IdB (Identity Broker), acting as a privacy enhancing blind caching-proxy, in OFELIA the <b>identity</b> <b>attributes</b> location in the Internet is hidden from the RP/SP (Relying Party, Service Provider) that wants to have temporary access to the users personal data.

40|$|The {{curse of}} {{dimensionality}} {{has remained a}} challenge {{for a wide variety}} of algorithms in data mining, clustering, classification and privacy. Recently, it was shown that an increasing dimensionality makes the data resistant to effective privacy. The theoretical results seem to suggest that the dimensionality curse is a fundamental barrier to privacy preservation. However, in practice, we show that some of the common properties of real data can be leveraged in order to greatly ameliorate the negative effects of the curse of dimensionality. In real data sets, many dimensions contain high levels of inter-attribute correlations. Such correlations enable the use of a process known as vertical fragmentation in order to decompose the data into vertical subsets of smaller dimensionality. An information-theoretic criterion of mutual information is used in the vertical decomposition process. This allows the use of an anonymization process, which is based on combining results from multiple independent fragments. We present a general approach which can be applied to the k-anonymity, l-diversity, and t-closeness models. In the presence of inter-attribute correlations, such an approach continues to be much more robust in higher dimensionality, without losing accuracy. We present experimental results illustrating the effectiveness of the approach. This approach is resilient enough to prevent <b>identity,</b> <b>attribute,</b> and membership disclosure attack.

By federation we mean a group of organizations or service providers which have built trust among each other and enable sharing of user identity information amongst themselves. Our solution supports a step by step approach according to which an individual can first establish a digital identity followed by a secure and protected use of such identity. We first introduce a flexible approach to establish a single sign-on (SSO) ID in a federation. Then we show how a user can leverage this SSO ID to establish certified and uncertified user <b>identity</b> <b>attributes</b> without the dependence on PKI for user authentication. This makes the process more usable and enhances privacy. The major contribution {{of this paper is}} a novel solution for protection against identity theft of these <b>identity</b> <b>attributes.</b> Our approach is based on the use of zero-knowledge proof protocols and distributed hash tables. Revocation mechanisms of the <b>identity</b> <b>attributes</b> are also developed. We illustrate how current revocation techniques can benefit from the underlying federation framework and the use of distributed hash tables. Finally, we formally prove correctness and provide complexity results for our protocols. The complexity results show that our approach is efficient. In the paper we also show that the protocol is robust enough even in the case o...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to evaluate the key elements in the construction of cosistent organisational messages over time. In order to accomplish that, we propose the aligment of several elements: vision, misson, objectives, cultural values, optimal <b>identity</b> <b>attributes,</b> positioning, type of messages, communication style and means, and image [...] ...|$|R
