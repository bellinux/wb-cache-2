The use of intrakeloid resection and a form pressure device to treat pinna keloids. The recommendation of this therapy {{is to maintain}} constant pressure and duration of pressure therapy was about 25 weeks. Clinical innovation : This article will present inexpensive custom made pressure clips of various designs.

This has been an encouraging experience to use the different designs. Discussion : <b>Ear</b> <b>clip</b> prosthesis has been developed for maintaining pressure on ear lobe keloids before and after surgical removal. The prosthesis includes an <b>ear</b> <b>clip</b> to which heat-polymerized acrylic resin is attached, which covers the keloid area. Pressure therapy is widely used to help in the early maturation of scar tissue and to prevent the recurrence of keloid.

40|$|Introduction The ocular surface {{provides}} {{a unique opportunity}} to study hemodynamics since the vessels can be visualized directly, without treatment and non-invasively. The availability of instruments to measure various hemodynamic parameters on the ocular surface in an objective manner are lacking. The quantification of red blood cell velocity, blood oxygen saturation and conjunctival redness on the ocular surface using novel, validated techniques has the potential of providing useful information about vascular physiology. The specific aims of each chapter are as follows: Chapter 3 : The objective was to design, develop and validate a system that would non-invasively quantify the red blood cell velocity in the conjunctival vessels. A tool was developed to automatically analyze video sequences of conjunctival vessels, digitally imaged with high enough magnification to resolve movement of the blood within the vessel. Chapter 4 : The objective was to: a) design and develop a method in order to non-invasively quantify the changes in blood oxygen saturation (SO 2) in the conjunctival vessels and demonstrate reliability of the measures and, b) demonstrate the application of the method by showing a response to an isocapnic hyperoxic provocation and compare those values to the results from a valid instrument. Chapter 5 : The aim of this experiment was to examine variations in ocular redness levels, red blood cell velocities and oxygen saturation levels over time in clinically healthy participants and also to compare differences between two age groups. Chapter 6 : The aim of this experiment was to examine the ocular redness levels, red blood cell velocities and oxygen saturation levels in clinically healthy participants when a topical ophthalmic decongestant was instilled onto the eye and to demonstrate the validity of the use of two novel techniques. Chapter 7 : The aim of this experiment was to examine ocular redness, red blood cell velocity and oxygen saturation in participants who were habitual soft contact lens wearers (study) compared to those that did not (control) and also to compare differences in silicone (SH) and non-silicone hydrogel wearers. Methods Chapter 3 : Simulations representing moving RBCs within a vessel and the random variation of each cell in terms of speed, shape and intensity were created in order to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. For each vessel, a signal that correlated to blood cell position was extracted from each frame, and the inter-frame displacement was estimated through a modified dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm. This provided the red blood cell velocity over time in each point of the vessels. Thus, from these estimates, the mean red blood cell velocity for each vessel was easily evaluated. The true mean velocity from the simulation with the one estimated by the algorithm was compared and the system accuracy was determined. Chapter 4 : a) Conjunctival vessels were imaged with two narrow-band interference filters with O 2 -sensitive and O 2 -insensitive peak transmissions using a Zeiss slit lamp at 32 x magnification. Optical densities were calculated from vascular segments using the average reflected intensities inside and outside the vessels. Optical density ratios were used to calculate relative oxygen saturation values. Video images of the bulbar conjunctiva were recorded at three times of the day. Measurement repeatability was assessed over location at each time and across consecutive frames. b) Subjects initially breathed air for 10 minutes followed by pure oxygen (O 2) for 20 minutes, and then air for a final 10 minute period using a sequential re-breathing circuit. Simultaneously, SO 2 values measured with a pulse oximeter <b>ear</b> <b>clip</b> and finger clip were recorded. The validity of the dual wavelength method was demonstrated by comparing the values to those from the <b>ear</b> <b>clip</b> pulse oximeter. Chapter 5 : Participants attended eight separate visits {{over the course of a}} day. Levels of bulbar conjunctival redness, red blood cell velocity and blood oxygen saturation were measured on a vessel of interest. Chapter 6 : Participants attended three separate visits during an allotted 60 minute session. Bulbar conjunctival redness, red blood cell velocity and blood oxygen saturation were measured on a vessel of interest, pre-insertion, just after insertion and, 10 minutes after insertion of a topical ocular decongestant. Significant differences between the three measures were assessed and correlations between the three parameters were reported. Chapter 7 : Participants were measured 8 times over the course of a day with their contact lenses in place. Bulbar conjunctival redness, red blood cell velocity and blood oxygen saturation were measured. Results Chapter 3 : Results for the simulated videos demonstrated a very good concordance between the estimated and actual velocities supporting its validity. The mean relative error for the modified Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method is 6 %. Chapter 4 : The intraclass correlations (ICCs) between the three locations at each time point were 0. 93, 0. 56 and 0. 86 respectively. Measurements across 5 consecutive frames showed no significant difference for all subjects (ICC = 0. 96). The ICCs between the two methods at each time point were 0. 45, 0. 10 and 0. 11 respectively. a) There was no significant difference in SO 2 between the three locations measured using the dual wavelength method for all subjects. There was also no significant difference between the three locations at any of the time points for the dual wavelength method. b) In response to isocapnic hyperoxic provocation using the dual wavelength method, blood oxygen saturation was increased from control values and subsequently recovered after withdrawal of hyperoxia. Blood oxygen saturation values recorded from the <b>ear</b> <b>clip</b> and finger clip of the pulse oximeter also showed an increase from control values and subsequently recovered after withdrawal of hyperoxia. SO 2 comparison between the dual wavelength method and the ear-clip pulse oximeter method did not show a significant difference. The interaction between the two methods and time on SO 2 was not significant. Chapter 5 : From baseline, the group mean redness and oxygen saturation did not change significantly over time. There was a significant difference in the group mean red blood cell velocity values over time. There was no significant difference between age strata for all three measures. Chapter 6 : After drop instillation redness values decreased significantly. There was no change in red blood cell velocity and oxygen saturation over time. There was a moderate significant correlation between SO 2 and red blood cell velocity just after drop insertion. Chapter 7 : When comparing the study and control groups, no significant difference in redness or SO 2 over time was found. RBC velocity over time was found to be significantly different between groups. When comparing the two study groups (SH vs. hydrogel) no significant difference across either measure over time was found. Conclusions Chapter 3 : Signal displacement estimation through the DTW algorithm can be used to estimate mean red blood cell velocity. Successful application of the algorithm in the estimation of RBC velocity in conjunctival vessels was demonstrated. Chapter 4 : The application of the dual wavelength method was demonstrated and optical density ratios can be used in a reliable manner for relative oxygen saturation measurements. This valid method promises to enable the study of conjunctival O 2 saturation under various experimental and physiological conditions. Chapter 5 : The results of this study support the theory of metabolic regulation. The lack of any significant change across time for redness and oxygen saturation along with significant changes in red blood cell velocity substantiates this notion. Chapter 6 : This study supports the literature regarding metabolic regulation of the microvasculature during the use of various stimuli. The results demonstrated that oxygen saturation levels remain stable even when a significant decrease in ocular redness is measured. The novel techniques used in this experiment demonstrated the expected action of the decongestant further contributing to their application and validity. Chapter 7 : In summary, the participants in the study group were habitual contact lens wearers that had lower RBC velocities when compared to the control group supporting the notion that contact lenses initiate a hypoxic response. The lack of change in SO 2 in either group supports the theory of metabolic regulation...|$|E

40|$|A {{basic and}} an {{improved}} <b>ear</b> <b>clipping</b> based algorithm for triangulating simple polygons and polygons with holes are presented. In the basic version, the ear with smallest interior angle is always selected {{to be cut}} {{in order to create}} fewer sliver triangles. To reduce sliver triangles in further, a bound of angle is set to determine whether a newly formed triangle has sharp angles, and edge swapping is accepted when the triangle is sharp. To apply the two algorithms on polygons with holes, "Bridge" edges are created to transform a polygon with holes to a degenerate polygon which can be triangulated by the two algorithms. Applications show that the basic algorithm can avoid creating sliver triangles and obtain better triangulations than the traditional <b>ear</b> <b>clipping</b> algorithm, and the improved algorithm can in further reduce sliver triangles effectively. Both of the algorithms run in O(n 2) time and O(n) space.

30|$|Within the AMA {{representation}} framework, we {{have developed}} a GPRAMA method based on the greedy-point removal scheme and a mesh patching technique. The local polygon (may be concave) surrounding a mesh vertex can be triangulated using constrained Delaunay triangulation or <b>ear</b> <b>clipping</b> method. When choosing the initial points using the error-diffusion scheme and CDT is chosen for mesh patching, the corresponding representation method is denoted as GPRED-CDT that {{is essentially the same}} as the GPRFS-ED method proposed by Adams [17]; while choosing EC for mesh patching leads to an improved version denoted as GPRED-EC. When starting the initial points from an AMA mesh, in particular, an M_aniso mesh, and EC is chosen for mesh patching, we obtain the GPRAMA representation method that provides better quality than the GPRFS-ED method but with lower computational cost. Overall, mesh patching with EC provides better quality for GPR-related representation methods than mesh patching with CDT. Numerical results on two standard test images, Lena and peppers, are presented, as well as on an image of the Golden Gate Bridge that has higher resolution. The observations are confirmed by the results from three other images. All the results demonstrate that AMA representation is superior than ED representation, and GPRAMA performs better than the GPRFS-ED method.|$|R
40|$|Adult bear {{individuals}} live solitary and haveprolonged parent–offspring relationships, {{therefore the}} share of learned skills compared to the inherited ones is much larger than in other carnivores. This promotes acquisition of deviated behavior and simultaneously establishment of a kinship structure. However, deviated bear behavior and human food conditioning are the symptoms of habituation. The aim {{of this paper is}} to test the genetic structuring of habituated and non-habituated individuals located in the central region of Romania (Braşov and Prahova districts), a hotspot in terms of human-bear conflicts. Seven microsatellites were used to genotype 145  samples (<b>ear</b> <b>clips</b> and tissue), out of which 82 were classified as habituated and 63 as wild individuals, respectively. Our results suggest the presence of kinship structures in habituated bear group and a reduction of genetic diversity (He = 0. 75), while the group located in the wild registered a higher genetic diversity (He = 0. 78) and more private alleles. The genetic differentiation suggested by the Neighbor joining cluster analysis has been strengthened by the two percent (AMOVA) differences between the two groups and highlights the negative impact of brown bear kinship structure, caused by the human expansion on wilderness. The genetic analyses indicated that the two groups share genetic variants due to the dispersal and breeding patterns of male adult bears. The emergence of genetic differences between the two groups can be avoided by preventing bears to become human-food conditioned; over time, kinship structure can pose a threat to genetic diversity. </p...|$|R

Gidagathi Hazarika was appointed Borphukan, and Holou, grandson of Pikchai Chetia, as Gargayan Deka Phukan. These high-handed actions on the part of Bhotai and Madha militated against the authority of the Swargadeo, but no harsh measures could be adopted, as the two leaders were the idols of the people. Lora Raja’s advisers therefore proposed to deal with Bhotai and Madha with consideration and tact. The Phukans attending on the monarch sent two envoys, Madhabcharan Kataki and Ananta Kataki, to ask Bhotai and Madha to come to the palace and offer their submission to His Majesty. Bhotai Deka at first refused the invitation, as he suspected some trap for him and his supporters. But after much persuasion by his comrades, who were threatened with slaughter if he refused the king’s invitation, he accepted it. The king sent Gargayan Sandikoi Phukan to escort Bhotai Deka and his adherents to the palace. The insurgents first released Marangi Borbarua and then went to the palace. They were arrested on approaching His Majesty, however. They were then allowed to kneel down before the Swargadeo and solemnly affirm their allegiance, whereupon they were set at liberty. Bhotai Deka Saikia and Madha Tamuli were dismissed from their respective offices, however, and sent home without further punishment. Marangi Borbarua fell prostrate {{at the feet of the}} Phukans and begged for mercy. He was let off after having his <b>ears</b> <b>clipped.</b> In obedience to the orders of the king, Bhotai Deka left the capital and proceeded to his home in Nagaon. As he was sailing down to Kaliabar, his boat was sighted by Hulou Deka-Phukan, who signaled to the oarsmen to steer Bhotai’s boat toward his own barge. The Phukan transferred Bhotai to his boat and told the king it was inadvisable to allow Bhotai to be at liberty unmutilated. After obtaining the king's permission, Hulou Phukan cut off Bhotai's ears and nose, put out one of his eyes, and let him return to his home in Nagaon.|$|R
5000|$|Bridle path: {{a section}} of mane, just behind the <b>ears,</b> is {{frequently}} <b>clipped</b> or shaved off. For practical purposes, this allows the bridle to lie comfortably on the across the poll, makes it slightly easier to bridle the horse, as the mane and forelock are separated and easier {{to keep out of}} the way. The length of the bridle path varies by breed and region of the world: for example, the American Saddlebred and the Arabian are commonly shown in the United States with bridle paths that are several inches long, while other breeds (such as the Friesian horse) are not permitted to have any bridle path. In the UK and continental Europe, bridle paths are generally rather short if clipped at all, though there is variation depending on breed.|$|R
5000|$|The trilogy {{is set in}} {{the large}} city of London. Borribles are runaway children, who {{eventually}} become [...] "Borribled," [...] when they wake up and find their ears have become pointed. Visually very similar to the mischievous elves and pixies of English folklore, Borribles wear woolen hats pulled low over their ears to avoid being easily identified by the police [...] "Woollies". The Woollies believe that the Borribles' freedom is a threat to the social order and will <b>clip</b> the <b>ears</b> of any Borrible in their custody. If their <b>ears</b> are not <b>clipped,</b> Borribles will maintain the appearance of a child forever and cease to physically age. Being caught by the police is a prospect worse than death for Borribles as it will signify the end of their lifestyle and they will become a boring, adventureless adult.|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- The aim of {{the project}} is to develop {{intelligent}} pillow to monitor the heart rate by using fiber optical sensor. The research is focused upon allowing more automation of patient care, an especially important matter for the elder population or bedridden patients, which is a rapidly growing fraction {{of much of the}} world population today. The fiber-optical sensor is built into pillow. Patients can determine their heart rate by just lying on the pillow and the device will not cause any disturbance to patients {{and at the same time}} still monitoring the heart rate. ECG electrodes and finger <b>clip</b> / <b>ear</b> lobe <b>clip</b> probes (using IR LED and photodiode technology) are commonly used for monitoring heart rate. Unfortunately, they are inconvenient and inadequate for long-term, everyday measurements. Fiber-optical sensing overcomes many of these challenges by using light rather than electricity and standard optical fiber in place of copper wire. Optical fibers are nonconductive, electrically passive, immune to electromagnetic interference (EMI) -induced noise, and able to transmit data over long distances with little or no loss in signal integrity. Using the concept of light and the benefits of using fiber optical sensors to detect the heart rate, PPG(photoplethysmogram) is being used in this project. A photoplethysmogram (PPG) is an optically obtained plethysmogram, a volumetric measurement of an organ. A PPG is often obtained by using a pulse oximeter which illuminates the skin and measures changes in light absorption (Shelley and Shelley, 2001) ...|$|R
60|$|How {{was it that}} he did not {{see that}} he was not experimenting with habits or {{characteristics}} at all? How had he overlooked the glaring fact that his experiment had been tried for many generations in China on the feet of Chinese women without producing the smallest tendency on their part to be born with abnormally small feet? He must have known about the bound feet even if he knew nothing of the mutilations, the <b>clipped</b> <b>ears</b> and docked tails, practised by dog fanciers and horse breeders on many generations of the unfortunate animals they deal in. Such amazing blindness and stupidity {{on the part of a}} man who was naturally neither blind nor stupid is a telling illustration of what Darwin unintentionally did to the minds of his disciples by turning their attention so exclusively towards the part played in Evolution by accident and violence operating with entire callousness to suffering and sentiment.|$|R
