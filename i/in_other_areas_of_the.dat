5|$|A {{cultivator}} of olives, Davenport {{had planted}} {{a limited number}} of olives around Beaumont House in 1852 after he purchased the land the year before. Davenport later expanded his groves by replanting trees and cuttings from Beaumont both <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> allotment and at some of his other properties in the Adelaide Hills. He also planted mulberry trees for producing silk on the estate grounds.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} {{contingent of}} British (principally Welsh) immigrants arrived between 1914 and 1950, settling in the present-day region of Magallanes.

5|$|Based on Apollo 17 observations, {{the valley}} floor is {{generally}} a gently rolling plane. Boulders of various sizes and other geologic deposits are scattered throughout the valley.

5|$|In August, a bill {{authorizing the}} Argentine Navy to acquire three dreadnoughts {{was passed by}} the Chamber of Deputies seventy-two to thirteen. Three months later, it was {{defeated}} in the Senate after they approved an arbitration treaty and the government made a last-ditch offer to purchase one of the two Brazilian dreadnoughts currently being constructed. The Brazilian government declined, so the bill was reintroduced and passed by the Senate on 17 December 1908 with forty-nine in support to thirteen opposed, over socialist objections that the country needed to be populated and the large sum of money (£14,000,000) could be better spent <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government.|$|E
5|$|The {{boom in the}} oil {{industry}} also helped promote other industries <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state. Lumber production thrived as demand climbed for construction of railroads, refineries, and oil derricks, and, in 1907, Texas was the third largest lumber producer in the United States. Growing cities required many new homes and buildings, thus benefiting the construction industry. Agriculture and ranching grew stronger as the rapidly expanding population created more demand for their produce.|$|E

5|$|This breed, {{along with}} other brachycephalic dogs (e.g., boxers, bulldogs), are also prone to hemivertebrae. The curled tail of a British bulldog {{is an example of}} a hemivertebrae, but when it occurs not in the {{coccygeal}} vertebrae but <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spine, it can cause paralysis. The condition occurs when two parts of a spinal vertebra do not fuse properly while a young Pug is still growing, resulting in an irregularly shaped spinal cavity which can put pressure on the spinal cord.|$|E
5|$|This was {{a success}} for the western {{development}} project at some level, for statistics show a substantial growth in foreign investment in the western regions. However, the rate of progress was not equal in all regions, partially due {{to the creation of}} the West Triangle Economic Zone, which sped up development in Chengdu, Chongqing, and Xi'an, but slowed down development <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West. For example, while foreign direct investment in Chongqing grew, foreign investment in other Western Chinese cities like Guizhou, Guangxi, and Ningxia declined significantly, dropping about USD $19.71, $250.96 million, and $34.54 million respectively.|$|E
5|$|By September1, {{the storm}} began to consolidate, with {{reconnaissance}} flights finding an elongated center and surface winds of 60mph (95km/h). Moderate wind shear inhibited convective {{development in the}} western portion; however, outflow <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm improved, leading to further development. A northwest track, fully identified by this time as a mid-tropospheric ridge located over Florida, strengthened. Remaining disorganized, Earl continued to intensify {{as the center of}} circulation was located close to deep convection. The NHC stated in their fifth advisory on the storm that Earl {{did not appear to be}} fully tropical due to the lack of organization. Around 1200UTC on September2, Earl intensified into a hurricane despite having an atypical structure; the wind field of the storm was asymmetric and the strongest winds were located well to the southeast of the center.|$|E

5|$|Fisheries {{operating}} off Portugal and Japan {{are responsible}} for most commercial landings of the kitefin shark, generally as bycatch in bottom trawls and on hook-and-line. Portugal reported a kitefin shark bycatch of 282 tons in 2000 and 119 tons in 2003. <b>In</b> <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> northeastern Atlantic this shark is rare and reported catches are likely confounded by misidentifications of other species; some are caught by mixed-species gillnet fisheries operating in deep water west of the British Isles, where surveys suggest that kitefin shark numbers may have declined by 94% since the 1970s. In the Mediterranean, this shark is caught incidentally by bottom trawl and gillnet fisheries. Although it is generally discarded alive, many are unable to return to deep water and do not survive. In the Southern Hemisphere, catches by the Australian South East Trawl Fishery are increasing following the relaxation of regulations regarding seafood mercury content; this species is not included under Australian fishery quotas. New Zealand kitefin shark catches peaked from 1986 to 1997. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the kitefin shark as Near Threatened worldwide, and as Vulnerable in the northeastern Atlantic in light of documented population declines.|$|E
5|$|In {{the public}} school system of Baltimore city, music {{education}} is a part of each grade level to high school, at which point it becomes optional. Beginning in first grade, or approximately six years old, Baltimore students begin to learn about melody, harmony and rhythm, and are taught to echo short melodic and rhythmic patterns. They also begin to learn about different musical instruments and distinguish between different kinds of sounds and types of songs. As students progress through the grades, teachers go into more detail and require more proficiency in elementary musical techniques. Students perform rounds in second grade, for example, while movement (i.e. dance) enters the curriculum in third grade. Beginning in middle school in the sixth grade, students are taught to make mature aesthetic judgements, and to understand and respond to a variety of forms of music. In high school, students may choose to take courses in instrumentation or singing, and may be exposed to music <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> curriculum, such as in theater or drama classes.|$|E
5|$|The Clan Class {{was based}} upon the Britannia Class design, {{incorporating}} a smaller boiler and various weight-saving measures to increase the route availability of a Pacific-type locomotive for its intended area of operations, the west of Scotland. The Clan Class received a mixed reception from crews, with those regularly operating the locomotives giving favourable reports as regards performance. However, trials <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British Railways network returned negative feedback, a common complaint being that difficulty in steaming the locomotive {{made it hard to}} adhere to timetables. Reports exist that suggest a degree of the disappointment with these locomotives was attributable to their being allocated to Class 7 work where they were only a Class 6 in reality; a problem put down to their very similar appearance to the BR Standard Class 7.|$|E

5|$|The {{economy is}} heavily reliant upon {{remittances}} from overseas Filipinos, which surpass {{foreign direct investment}} {{as a source of}} foreign currency. Remittances peaked in 2010 at 10.4% of the national GDP, and were 8.6% in 2012 and in 2014, Philippines total worth of foreign exchange remittances was US$28 billion. Regional development is uneven, with Luzon – Metro Manila in particular – gaining most of the new economic growth {{at the expense of the}} other regions, although the government has taken steps to distribute economic growth by promoting investment <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country.
