500|$|The band {{recorded}} {{its debut}} album, Bleed the Fifth in early 2007 with production duties handled by former Machine Head guitarist Logan Mader. The {{title of the}} album is a play on words, Cazares comments [...] "You {{have the right to}} <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>mouth</b> shut, but on this record we believe we’re saying a lot". Cummings wrote the majority of the lyrics, which are about personal strifes and how people overcome them. Much of the lyrical content was influenced by the Book of Revelation, natural disasters, war, and terrorism. Cazares stated the album is a [...] "big fuck you" [...] to the people who want his projects to fail.|$|E
500|$|Chrissie left Den but was {{eventually}} convinced {{to give their}} marriage another try. Oberman revealed in the Daily Mail that she drew on a famous real-life model to reconcile the dichotomous behaviour of a strong woman taking back her cheating husband: [...] "I based Chrissie on Hillary: an intelligent, attractive woman who was publicly humiliated. People ask why she stays with that awful man. A lot of strong women are like that." [...] She also saw {{the ebb and flow}} of Den and Chrissie's marriage as a reflection of the mental gameplaying that was so prominent in their characterisations: [...] "I think there's a challenge in it, and I think she would like to be the one who would ultimately tame him." [...] As Den's equal, Chrissie was intended to be a challenge to his propensity for intellectual games, having already outwitted the show's prior , Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Den had seen little threat in his first wife's aptitude, but considered Chrissie to be [...] "as sharp as they come". Indeed, Den's extra-marital dalliances were used by writers to showcase and highlight Chrissie's [...] "strong-willed persona". When Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan) chastised Den for caring only about Chrissie's reaction should she learn of their affair, Den fired back: [...] "And so should you. You think I've treated you badly? Well you don't have a clue what's going to happen if she ever finds out! The best thing you can do is <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>mouth</b> shut." [...] By the time Chrissie left the Square, Oberman dryly observed that she had [...] "had more fights on EastEnders than most women have in their whole lives." ...|$|E

500|$|Drummer Butch Vig {{stated that}} the album is a [...] "much simpler record than Version 2.0": [...] "All of the songs sort of came from us playing live downstairs [...] with guitar, bass and drums ... That was the only {{conscious}} decision we made – to make the songs simpler. Some of the songs are still layered in spots; compared to the last record, there're about half as many tracks. As far as sounds go, it's basically drums, bass, some heavy guitars and Shirley singing." [...] Erikson agreed that a more organic sound and simplistic approach with respect to production is embodied by the final mix of the album. [...] "A lot of songs took shape {{in just a few}} hours as opposed to a few months with the last record.Some of the songs obviously took a long time, or we wouldn't have been in the studio for a full year. But a lot of them happened very quickly. 'Silence Is Golden' we recorded basically in three days and it was done. 'So Like a Rose,' for the most part, was recorded in three hours. I think we spent a lot of time just trying to resist adding stuff to [...] Because that was our tendency on the other two records.” On the lyrical content of the songs, Vig remarked that [...] " [...] aren't specifically responses to the industry, but they could be read that way. Shirley has said that, for example, 'Shut Your Mouth' is about all the bullshit that's out there, but it's also a sort of note to self to <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>mouth</b> shut, because she says she's the biggest, most opinionated loudmouth of anyone around. So they work on multiple levels." ...|$|E
500|$|Whereas most Hollywood {{productions}} {{of the day}} took {{little more than a}} month to shoot, Wings took approximately nine months to complete in total. Although Wellman was generating spectacular aerial footage and making Hollywood film history, Paramount expressed concerns with the cost of production and expanding budget. They sent an executive to San Antonio to complain to Wellman who swiftly told him that he had two options, [...] "a trip home or a trip to the hospital". According to biographer Frank T. Thompson, Wellman approached producer David O. Selznick regarding a contract predicament asking him what he should do to which Selznick replied, [...] "Just <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>mouth</b> shut. You've got 'em where it hurts." [...] The cast and crew {{had a lot of time}} on their hands between shooting sequences, and according to director Wellman, [...] "San Antonio became the Armageddon of a magnificent sexual Donnybrook". He recalled that they stayed at the Saint Anthony Hotel for nine months and by the time they left the elevator girls were all pregnant. He stated that Clara Bow openly flirted with the male cast members and several of the pilots which was reciprocated, despite having become engaged to Victor Fleming the day after arriving in San Antonio on September 16, 1926. Gary Cooper, appearing in a role which helped launch his career in Hollywood, began a tumultuous affair during the production with Bow. Cooper reportedly showed Howard Hughes the script to the film and he wasn't impressed, considering the drama in it to be [...] "sudsy", although he informed Cooper that he looked forward to seeing how Wellman would accomplish the technical aerial sequences. Bow strongly detested the costumes which were made for the film by Paramount designer Travis Banton, and slit the necklines and cut off the sleeves of his clothing, much to the chagrin of Banton.|$|E

2500|$|As {{early as}} December 1974—a {{year before the}} invasion—the Indonesian defense attaché in Washington sounded out US views about an Indonesian {{takeover}} of East Timor.

However, the administration worried about the potential impact on US–Indonesian relations {{in the event that}} a forced incorporation of East Timor was met with a major Congressional reaction. On 8 October 1975, Assistant Secretary of State Philip Habib told meeting participants that [...] "It looks like the Indonesians have begun the attack on Timor."

5000|$|Once Humes' record {{had become}} a hit, Decca Records rushed Lionel Hampton into the studio to record a similar song, which became [...] "Hey! Ba-Ba-Re-Bop". Their {{arrangement}} was similar to Jim Wynn's but added a call and response element between Hampton and his musicians, and replaced Humes' salacious verses with nonsense rhymes like: [...] "Matilda Brown told old King Tut, 'If you can't say rebop <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> big <b>mouth</b> shut', say hey ba-ba-re-bop...". Hampton was already a popular and established musician, at a bigger company than Humes' Philo, and his version soon knocked Humes off the charts and went to {{number one on the}} R&B chart for 16 weeks (a record broken at that time only by Joe Liggins' [...] "The Honeydripper" [...] and Louis Jordan's [...] "Choo Choo Ch'Boogie").|$|R
5000|$|The {{band members}} all possessed prior {{experience}} on the R&B club circuit before coming together as a group influenced by {{the outset of the}} British Invasion, more specifically the music of the Animals and the Pretty Things.

The band's original lineup, consisting of Eddie Rodrigues (lead guitar), Rick Campbell (organ), Greg Elmore (drums) and Bill Whittington (bass guitar), debuted on New Years Eve, and immediately gained a loyal local following in their hometown of Merced and an emerging presence in San Francisco. While their contemporaries outfitted themselves conservatively, the Brogues sported a rebellious image and performed hard-edged cover versions of British R&B standards such as [...] "Hubble Bubble Toil and Trouble" [...] and [...] "Mama <b>Keep</b> <b>Your</b> Big <b>Mouth</b> Shut".|$|R

[...] It was followed by their debut album, The Missing Links, in December. According to Allmusic's, Richie Unterberger, [...] "This aggregation cut the rawest Australian garage/punk of the era, and indeed some of the best from anywhere, sounding at their best like a fusion of the Troggs and the early Who, letting loose at times with wild feedback that was quite ahead of its time". [...] In 1966 Baden Hutchins and Ian Thomas would depart. [...] Hutchins, tired of the rock & roll lifestyle, was engaged to be married. Thomas returned to the Showmen, while the remaining members - Anderson, Gray, Ford and Jones - continued with an extended play, The Links Unchained in April 1966. The group disbanded in August.|$|R
