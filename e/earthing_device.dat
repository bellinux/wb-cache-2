5000|$|The Schuko system {{originated}} in Germany. It {{is believed to}} date from 1925 and is attributed to Albert Büttner, a Bavarian manufacturer of electrical accessories. [...] Büttner's company, Bayerische Elektrozubehör AG, was granted patent DE 489 003 in 1930 for a Stecker mit Erdungseinrichtung (plug with <b>earthing</b> <b>device).</b> [...] Büttner's patent DE 370 538 is often quoted as referring to Schuko, but it actually refers to a method of holding together all of the parts of a plug or socket with a single screw which also provides clamping for the wires; {{there is no mention}} of an earth connection in DE 370538. At this time Germany used a 220 V centre tap giving 110 V from current pins to earth, which meant that fuse links were required in both sides of the appliance and double pole switches. Variations of the original Schuko plug are used today in more than 40 countries, including most of Continental Europe.|$|E

5000|$|Due to the {{relatively}} high signal voltages used in SCART, [...] "hot plugging" [...] (connecting or disconnecting devices while they are on) is not recommended. Although there is no risk of personal injury, {{there is the possibility}} of damaging electronics within the devices if the connector is inserted improperly. Also, since many TVs are Class II (double-insulated) rather than earthed, the large exposed shield on the SCART connector will be held at approximately half mains voltage if it is plugged into a powered TV with the other end unplugged. If the cable is then plugged into an <b>earthed</b> <b>device</b> with a metal case, inadvertent contact with the SCART cable shield while the <b>earthed</b> <b>device</b> is touched with the other hand can cause a painful electric shock. For this reason the device end of the cable should always be plugged in first and the TV end plugged in last.|$|R

These requirements are intended to address issues of protection against surges and interference caused by lightning impulse currents and switching. Aim. To investigate the distribution of single-phase short-circuit current in the substation grounding devices. Task. On {{the basis of the}} proposed design scheme of substitution substation grounding device, consisting of a substation earthing system and «cable-supported» an algorithm for calculating the resistance of the grounding device substation and distribution of single-phase short-circuit current on the circuit elements. Method. Mathematical modeling and calculation engine. Results. On the basis of calculations and studies analyzed the current distribution of single-phase short-circuit between the substation earthing system and earthing «rope-reliance». Studies carried out for the actual range of variation of the circuit parameters, showed that the earthing resistance substation substantially affects the current distribution in the one-phase short circuit fault. For example, using the graph shows that with increasing resistance grounding system of "rope-supported" the proportion of single-phase short-circuit current flowing from the substation earthing increases, while the proportion of single-phase short-circuit current flowing from the grounding device supports decreases and vice versa. In addition, when rationing grounding systems at substations for the touch voltage is necessary to analyze all the possible modes of operation of the network, which is substationed. Conclusion. The results obtained are recommended to take into account in the design of grounding systems at substations...|$|E

40|$|The {{standard}} circuits for {{the measurement}} of impedances at frequencies up to about 50 Mc/s are bridge networks although special design incorporating shielding and <b>earthing</b> <b>devices</b> is necessary in the radio-frequency range. The theory of the various bridge methods assumes that the current flowing in any arm of the bridge is constant throughout its path and depends only on the potential difference applied across the arm and the impedance of the arm. Since the current {{at any point in}} a circuit depends on the magnetic field of the electro-magnetic wave in the vicinity and is not constant throughout the whole of its path, this assumption is only permissable for wavelengths which are large compared with the linear dimensions of the apparatus. In fact the current varies from a maximum to a minimum value in a distance where is the wavelength of the electro-magnetic wave associated with the current. At a frequency of 100 Mc/s, say 300 cms and 4. = 75 cms. It is impracticable to design bridges of the dimensions of a few centimetres and other methods have to be employed at these higher frequencies. An outline of these methods is given in Section I followed by a more detailed study of two of the methods in Sections II and III. The difficulty of obtaining a satisfactory short-circuit in order to find the critical separation of the Williams' method was then investigated. This was eliminated by plotting the graphs differently. This work is described in Section IV. Next an impedance was measured on the same apparatus by the Williams method (using this modification) and the Chipman method. These results are described and compared in Section V.
