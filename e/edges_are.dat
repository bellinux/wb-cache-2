The longer perimeter <b>edges</b> <b>are</b> called the side line, the opposing shorter <b>edges</b> <b>are</b> referred toe back {{line and the}} portion of this between the goal posts {{is known as the}} goal line. The side line must measure 91.40m (100yd) and the back line should measure 55.00m (60yd). There must be a minimum run-off of 2m at the sidelines and 3m at the backlines which may be a different surface for the final metre. All line markings must be white and 75 millimetres wide. In each corner of the pitch, a corner flag of no more than 300mm square is attached to a post of height 1.201.50m.|$|E
5|$|In another drawing style, the {{circular}} layout, the vertices of a graph {{are placed on}} a circle and the <b>edges</b> <b>are</b> drawn either inside or outside the circle. Again, a placement of the edges within the circle (for instance as straight line segments) corresponds to a one-page book drawing, while a placement {{both inside and outside}} the circle corresponds to a two-page book drawing.|$|E

5|$|It {{is crucial}} for these {{definitions}} that <b>edges</b> <b>are</b> only allowed to stay within a single page of the book. As Atneosen already observed, if edges may instead pass from one page to another across {{the spine of the}} book, then every graph may be embedded into a three-page book. For such a three-page topological book embedding in which spine crossings are allowed, every graph can be embedded with at most a logarithmic number of spine crossings per edge, and some graphs need this many spine crossings.|$|E
5|$|The {{notion of}} a book, as a topological space, was defined by C. A. Persinger and Gail Atneosen in the 1960s. As part of this work, Atneosen already {{considered}} embeddings of graphs in books. The embeddings he studied used the same definition as embeddings of graphs into any other topological space: vertices are represented by distinct points, <b>edges</b> <b>are</b> represented by curves, {{and the only way}} that two edges can intersect is for them to meet at a common endpoint.|$|E

5|$|After rodents, bats are {{the largest}} order of mammals, making up about 20% of mammal species. There are 1,240 bat species which are {{traditionally}} recognized to belong to two suborders of bats: Megachiroptera (megabats), and the Microchiroptera (microbats/echolocating bats). Not all megabats are larger than microbats. Microbats use echolocation, but megabats do not, {{with the exception of}} the genus Rousettus. Microbats lack the claw at the second finger of the forelimb. The ears of microbats do not close to form a ring; the <b>edges</b> <b>are</b> separated from each other at the base of the ear. Megabats eat fruit, nectar, or pollen. Most microbats eat insects; others may feed on fruit, nectar, pollen, fish, frogs, small mammals, or the blood of animals. Megabats have well-developed visual cortices and good visual acuity, while microbats rely on echolocation for navigation and finding prey.|$|E
5|$|In graph theory, a book {{embedding}} is a {{generalization of}} planar embedding of a graph to embeddings into a book, {{a collection of}} half-planes all having the same line as their boundary. Usually, the vertices of the graph are required to lie on this boundary line, called the spine, and the <b>edges</b> <b>are</b> required to stay within a single half-plane. The book thickness of a graph is the smallest possible number of half-planes for any book embedding of the graph. Book thickness is also called pagenumber, stacknumber or fixed outerthickness. Book embeddings have also been used to define several other graph invariants including the pagewidth and book crossing number.|$|E
5|$|In {{the upper}} incisors, the chewing <b>edges</b> <b>are</b> located behind the {{vertical}} {{plane of the}} incisors; thus, they are opisthodont. The microstructure of the enamel of the lower incisor was reported in a 2005 study. The inner portion (portio interna, PI) is much thicker than the outer portion (portio externa, PE). The PI consists of Hunter-Schreger bands, which are uniserial (consisting of a single enamel prism), as in all myomorph rodents. The PE consists of radial enamel, with flattened prisms that are almost parallel to the junction between the enamel and the dentine. The microstructure {{is similar to that}} of Holochilus brasiliensis and displays several characters seen only in Myomorpha.|$|E

5|$|The {{geometry}} of a back country ski {{depends on its}} purpose—skis suited for forested areas where loose powder can predominate may be shorter and wider than those selected for open, exposed areas where compacted snow may prevail. Sidecut on Telemark skis promotes turning in forest and rugged terrain. Width and short length aid turning in loose and deep snow. Longer, narrower and more rigid skis with sharp <b>edges</b> <b>are</b> suited for snow that has been compacted by wind or freeze-thaw. Touring ski design may represent a general-purpose compromise among these different ski conditions, plus being acceptable for use in groomed tracks. Traction may come from a textured or waxed grip zone, as with classic skis, or from ski skins, which are applied to the ski bottom for long, steep ascents and have hairs or mechanical texture that prevents sliding backwards.|$|E
5|$|The nasal and premaxillary bones do {{not extend}} back beyond {{the point where}} the lacrimal, frontal, and maxillary bones meet. The {{zygomatic}} plate, the flattened front part of the zygomatic arch, is broad and develops a notch at its front end. The plate's back margin is located before the first upper molar. The jugal bone, part of the zygomatic arch, is reduced, as usual in oryzomyines. The sphenopalatine foramen, a foramen (opening) {{at the side of the}} skull above the molars, is small; it is much larger in the marsh rice rat. The narrowest part of the interorbital region is towards the front and the <b>edges</b> <b>are</b> lined by prominent shelves. The parietal bones extend to the sides of the braincase. The interparietal bone is narrow and wedge-shaped, so that the parietal and squamosal bones meet extensively.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is olive-brown. Spores are {{somewhat}} fuse-shaped in face view, and inequilateral in profile view. They have a smooth surface, a tiny apical pore, and dimensions of 11–15 by 4–5.5μm, with walls about 0.2μm thick. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 8–12μm thick. Pleurocystidia (on the tube walls) are 28–42 by 6–11μm with a 3–μm neck, whereas the cheilocystidia (on the pore <b>edges)</b> <b>are</b> narrowly club-shaped and slightly smaller, measuring 26–38 by 4–8μm. Pleurocystidia tend to not protrude further than sporulating basidia. The cap cuticle comprises a 150μm-thick layer of narrow hyphae measuring 3–5μm {{more or less}} arranged in a trichodermium (wherein the outermost hyphae emerge roughly parallel, like hairs, perpendicular to the cap surface). These hyphae stain red when mounted in Melzer's reagent and yellow in potassium hydroxide. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae.|$|E

5|$|Sutner {{defines a}} {{directed}} graph (a type of de Bruijn graph) {{in which each}} vertex represents a pair of assignments of states for the cells in a contiguous sequence of cells. The length of this sequence is chosen to be one less than the neighborhood size of the automaton. An edge in Sutner's graph represents a pair of sequences of cells that overlap {{in all but one}} cell, so that the union of the sequences is a full neighborhood in the cellular automaton. Each such edge is directed from the overlapping subsequence on the left to the subsequence on the right. <b>Edges</b> <b>are</b> only included in the graph when they represent compatible state assignments on the overlapping parts of their cell sequences, and when the automaton rule (applied to the neighborhood determined by the potential edge) would give the same results for both assignments of states. By performing a linear-time strong connectivity analysis of this graph, it is possible to determine which of its vertices belong to cycles. The transition rule is non-injective if and only if this graph contains a directed cycle in which at least one vertex has two differing state assignments.|$|E
5|$|The marsh {{rice rat}} has a large, {{flattened}} skull {{with a short}} and broad rostrum. The nasal and premaxillary bones extend back beyond {{the point where the}} lacrimal, frontal, and maxillary bones meet. In P. o. planirostris, the rostrum is flatter than in mainland Florida forms, in which it is more convex, and the nasals are said to be relatively longer in P. o. argentatus. The zygomatic plate, the flattened front part of the zygomatic arch (cheekbone), is broad and develops a notch at its front end. The arches themselves are robust and contain small but distinct jugal bones. The sphenopalatine foramen, an opening {{in the side of the}} skull above the molars, is large; it is much smaller in O.couesi. The narrowest part of the region between the eyes is towards the front and the <b>edges</b> <b>are</b> lined by prominent shelves. The marsh rice rat has a narrow braincase lined by prominent ridges and a narrow interparietal bone. According to Goldman, Florida animals (P. o. coloratus and P. o. natator) generally have the largest and broadest skulls, and the western specimen (P. o. texensis) has a somewhat smaller and narrower skull than those from the east outside Florida (P. o. palustris). In P. o. argentatus, the skull is also relatively narrow.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} has been {{reported}} as ranging in color from pinkish, to pinkish-brown, to rosy brown, to vinaceous-fawn. The variation in spore print color results in part from differences in moisture content when recorded. Spores are roughly oblong to oval, smooth, hyaline (translucent) to pale brown, and measure 11–17 by 4–5.5µm. They are covered in a gelatinous sheath. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, two- and four-spored, thin-walled, and measure 25–35 by 10–14µm. Pleurocystidia (found on the tube walls) are roughly cylindrical to fuse-shaped with rounded tips, and measure 37–50 by 5–8µm. Cheilocystidia (on the tube <b>edges)</b> <b>are</b> fuse-shaped with a central swelling, thin-walled, and measure 23–40 by 6–8µm.
