It is also {{proposed}} {{to close the}} EWTF {{at the end of}} its useful life in accordance with the regulations. The facility would replace the existing Building 829 Open Burn Facility (B 829) and would treat <b>explosive</b> <b>waste</b> generated at the LLNL Livermore Site and at Site 300 either by open burning or open detonation, depending on the type of waste. The alternatives addressed in the 1992 sitewide EIS/EIR are reexamined in this EA. These alternatives included: (1) the no-action alternative which would continue open burning operations at B 829; (2) continuation of only open burning at a new facility (no open detonation); (3) termination of open burning operations with shipment of <b>explosive</b> <b>waste</b> offsite; and (4) the application of alternative treatment technologies. This EA examines the impact of construction, operation, and closure of the EWTF. Construction of the EWTF would result in the clearing of a small amount of previously disturbed ground. No adverse impact is expected to any state or federal special status plant or animal species (special status species are classified as threatened, endangered, or candidate species by either state or federal legislation). Operation of the EWTF is expected to result in a reduced threat to involved workers and the public because the proposed facility would relocate existing open burning operations to a more remote area and would incorporate design features to reduce the amount of potentially harmful emissions. No adverse impacts were identified for activities necessary to close the EWTF {{at the end of its}} useful life...|$|E

Volume 1 is {{the text of the}} risk assessment, and Volume 2 (provided on a compact disc) is the supporting modeling data. The EWTF is operated by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) at Site 300, which is located in the foothills between the cities of Livermore and Tracy, approximately 17 miles east of Livermore and 8 miles southwest of Tracy. Figure 1 is a map of the San Francisco Bay Area, showing the location of Site 300 and other points of reference. One of the principal activities of Site 300 is to test what are known as 'high explosives' for nuclear weapons. These are the highly energetic materials that provide the force to drive fissionable material to criticality. LLNL scientists develop and test the explosives and the integrated non-nuclear components in support of the United States nuclear stockpile stewardship program as well as in support of conventional weapons and the aircraft, mining, oil exploration, and construction industries. Many Site 300 facilities are used in support of high explosives research. Some facilities are used in the chemical formulation of explosives; others are locations where explosive charges are mechanically pressed; others are locations where the materials are inspected radiographically for such defects as cracks and voids. Finally, some facilities are locations where the machined charges are assembled before they are sent to the onsite test firing facilities, and additional facilities are locations where materials are stored. Wastes generated from high-explosives research are treated by open burning (OB) and open detonation (OD). OB and OD treatments are necessary because they are the safest methods for treating <b>explosives</b> <b>wastes</b> generated at these facilities, and they eliminate the requirement for further handling and transportation that would be required if the wastes were treated off site...|$|R

40|$|Many {{decision-making}} situations today {{affect the}} safety of individuals and the environment,for instance hazardous waste management. In practice, many of these decisions are madewithout an overall view and with the focus on either the environment or safety. Now and then the areas of regulation are in conflict, i. e. the best alternative according to environmental considerations {{is not always the}} safest way and vice versa. A tool for taking an overall view within the areas of safety and environment would simplify matters and provide authorities and industry with a better basis for their work. This thesis forms part of a project which aims to develop a framework tool giving this overall view and supporting decision-making in which the issues (areas) of environment, safety, ethics and costs are all integrated. By developing a framework tool, different areas of interest could be taken into consideration more easily when a decision is to be made and could also help develop legislation and policy locally (at an industry or company), nationally and internationally. The project also aims to provide knowledge about different destruction/decommission methods, their good and bad points and their consequences, in order to provide different actors with a better basis for decision-making. This thesis focuses on development of the framework. The scope of the studies was restricted to environment, ethics and personnel safety due to the extent of the work and time limitations. In the next part of the project, the areas of costs and evaluation will be studied and a first draft of the framework tool will be presented. In order to develop the framework tool, two case studies were carried out here: an environmental analysis involving a life cycle assessment and an ethical analysis. With the help of these analyses, three different methods of destruction of ammunition were compared: Open detonation, modelled both with and without recovery and recycling of metals; incineration in a static kiln with air pollution control combined with recycling of metals, modelled with two different levels of air emissions; and a combination of incineration with air pollution control, open burning, recovery of some energetic material and recycling of metals, giving a total of five options. Every method of destruction of energetic material, i. e. <b>explosive</b> <b>waste</b> or ammunition, results in environmental impacts in both the short and long term. These environmental impacts have direct or indirect impacts on safety, quality of life, the economy, etc., now and in the future, locally and globally. Life cycle assessment revealed two factors of importance for reducing the environmental impacts: Recycling the metals and air pollution control. As a consequence of controlling these potential negative environmental impacts, safety problems might also be controlled. Ethical analysis revealed that future generations and people in foreign countries will be affected by the destruction of ammunition. When choosing a method for destruction of ammunition, this group (the general public) should thus be given special attention.  QC 2010121...|$|E

Zebrafish embryos are ideal model vertebrates for high-throughput toxicity screening and live in vivo imaging due to their small size and transparency during embryogenesis. Here, we used Single Plane Illumination Microscopy (SPIM) /light sheet microscopy to assess the developmental toxicity of explosive-contaminated water in zebrafish embryos and report 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene-associated developmental abnormalities, including defects in heart formation and circulation, in 3 D.

40|$|Human {{health and}} {{ecological}} risk assessments are required {{as part of}} the Resource Recovery and Conservation Act (RCRA) permit renewal process for waste treatment units. This risk assessment is prepared in support of the RCRA permit renewal for the <b>Explosives</b> <b>Waste</b> Treatment Facility (EWTF) at Site 300 of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). The human health risk assessment is based on U. S. Environmental Protection Agency- (U. S. EPA) approved emissions factors and on California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA), California Air Resources Board (CARB) and U. S. EPA assessment and air dispersion models. This risk assessment identifies the receptors of concern and evaluates theoretical carcinogenic risk, and theoretical acute and chronic non-carcinogenic hazard, following those guidelines. The carcinogenic risk to a 30 -year resident at the maximum off-site receptor location is 0. 0000006 or 0. 6 in 1 million. The carcinogenic risk to a 25 -year worker at the maximum bystander on-site receptor location is also 0. 0000006 or 0. 6 in 1 million. Any risk of less than 1 in a million is below the level of regulatory concern. The acute non-carcinogenic hazard for the 30 -year resident is 0. 01, and the chronic non-carcinogenic hazard is 0. 01. The acute non-carcinogenic hazard for the 25 -year worker is 0. 3, and the chronic non-carcinogenic hazard is 0. 2. The point of comparison for acute and chronic non-carcinogenic hazard is 1. 0; an estimate less than 1. 0 is below the level of regulatory concern. The estimates of health effects are based on health conservative assumptions and represent an upper bound of the possible exposures to the receptors. Based on these results, emissions from the operations of the EWTF should not be of concern for human health. For the ecological risk assessment (ERA), 10 receptor species (including plants), representing members of the trophic levels in the habitat of Site 300, were evaluated for the possibility of potential detrimental effects from EWTF emissions. The ecological hazard quotients (EHQs) at a location closest to the EWTF suggest a potential for adverse consequences. However, the conservatisms incorporated into the analysis may overestimate potential consequences and may explain the potential for impacts. Using less conservative values suggests that there is a possibility for limited to no additional impact to occur from the continuing operation of the EWTF...|$|R

MSD converts the organic constituents of the waste into non-hazardous substances such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen and water. Any inorganic constituents of the waste, such as binders and metallic particles, are retained in the molten salt. The destruction of energetic material waste is accomplished by introducing it, together with air, into a crucible containing a molten salt, in this case a eutectic mixture of Na, K, and Li carbonates. The following pure component DOE and DoD explosives have been destroyed in LLNL`s experimental unit at their High Explosives Applications Facility (HEAF) : ammonium picrate, HMX, K- 6, NQ, NTO, PETN, RDX, TATB, and TNT.

Following WWI, {{some of the}} chemical agents, ordnance, and laboratory wastes generated at the site were disposed of at AUES and in an adjacent area known as Spring Valley. Recent discoveries of those buried munitions and chemical agents have resulted in both the Spring Valley neighborhood and the American University being designated a Formerly Used Defense Site (FUDS). This designation authorizes the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to address environmental contamination resulting from past Department of Defense activities at the American University/Spring Valley site (sometimes collectively referred to in this health consultation as the Spring Valley Community). Since 1993, the USACE has been investigating the Spring Valley Community to determine where {{and to what extent}} the Army disposed of buried ordnance, <b>explosive</b> <b>wastes,</b> and hazardous substances. USACE found several burial pits containing munitions and chemical agents as well as arsenic in soil exceeding background levels. The primary chemical agents found were mustard agent, lewisite, and their degradation products. In 2002, the USACE determined that three artillery shells found at the Glenbrook Road burial pits contained arsine gas. Some community members believe their health is being adversely affected because of AUES- related activities. In this evaluation, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) considers community health concerns and possible health implications of detected levels of contaminants. This assessment is an analysis of site-specific environmental and health data, exposure investigations, as well as a literature review on reported diseases. We consider exposure to arsenic in soil, indoor dust and air, and drinking water as well as other contaminants according to available data. ATSDR also evaluated possible hazards associated with materials found in burial pits and surface disposal areas and whether buried contaminants could migrate and reach people (e. g., via groundwater orsoil gas). As summarized below, our assessment indicates that most people in Spring Valley have not and will not experience adverse health effects due to AUES activities because exposure point concentrations are not high enough to result in adverse health effects. An ATSDR health consultation is a verbal or written response from ATSDR to a specific request for information about health risks related to a specific site, a chemical release, or the presence of hazardous material. In order to prevent or mitigate exposures, a consultation may lead to specific actions, such as restricting use of or replacing water supplies; intensifying environmental sampling; restricting site access; or removing the contaminated material. In addition, consultations may recommend additional public health actions, such as conducting health surveillance activities to evaluate exposure or trends in adverse health outcomes; conducting biological indicators of exposure studies to assess exposure; and providing health education for health care providers and community members...|$|R

40|$|Under anoxic {{conditions}} Pseudomonas sp. strain JLR 11 can use 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT) as {{the sole}} N source, releasing nitrite from the aromatic ring and subsequently reducing it to ammonium and incorporating it into C skeletons. This study shows that TNT {{can also be used}} as a terminal electron acceptor in respiratory chains under anoxic conditions by Pseudomonas sp. strain JLR 11. TNT-dependent proton translocation cou-pled to the reduction of TNT to aminonitrotoluenes has been observed in TNT-grown cells. This extrusion did not occur in nitrate-grown cells or in anaerobic TNT-grown cells treated with cyanide, a respiratory chain inhib-itor. We have shown that in a membrane fraction prepared from Pseudomonas sp. strain JLR 11 grown on TNT under anaerobic conditions, the synthesis of ATP was coupled to the oxidation of molecular hydrogen and to the reduction of TNT. This phosphorylation was uncoupled by gramicidin. Respiration by Pseudomonas sp. strain JLR 11 is potentially useful for the biotreatment of TNT in polluted waters and soils, particularly in phy-torhizoremediation, in which bacterial cells are transported to the deepest root zones, which are poor in oxygen. 2, 4, 6 -Trinitrotoluene (TNT) is a major contaminant in many military sites, where manufacturing and decommissioning op-erations generate large quantities of this <b>explosive</b> as a <b>waste</b> product. Much of this waste is deposited in the soil and i...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Mobile robot {{teleoperation}} {{has been}} used in many areas of industrial automation, such as <b>explosives</b> disposal, nuclear <b>waste</b> manipulation, freight handling or transportation. Here, the commonly provided audio-visual feedback often resulted in an inadequate perception of the remote environment. Haptic augmentation was shown to improve and positively enhance the control of the mobile robot. This paper presents a novel Self-Organizing Fuzzy Adaptive Mapping algorithm (SOFAMap) for a haptic teleoperation of mobile robots. The SOFAMap algorithm was specifically developed for a mobile robot with a rotational sonar sensory system, constituting an alternative to a traditionally used multi-sonar array. The main contributions of this work are: 1) development of a specific selforganizing environment mapping structure inspired by the Growing Neural Gas algorithm; 2) incorporating a fuzzy controller into the algorithm to adapt to robot’s motion; 3) resolving typical issues such as sensor noise, communication time delay and low sampling rate. The experimental testing was performed in both virtual environment and on a real robotic platform, consisting of a Lego NXT mobile robot and a Novint Falcon 3 -DOF haptic interface. The results showed that a highfidelity haptic feedback can be successfully generated using a simpler and more affordable rotational sonar sensory system, as opposed to the typical multi-sonar array. Further, it was demonstrated that the SOFAMap algorithm improves the operator’s awareness of unstructured environments, making it applicable to wide range of mobile robot teleoperation systems...|$|R
40|$|For {{the past}} few years, the Department of Energy has favored the direct {{disposal}} of low plutonium content residue materials from Rocky Flats rather than engage in expensive and time consuming plutonium recovery operations. One impediment to direct disposal has been the wattage limit imposed by the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant on hydrogenous materials such as combustibles and sludges. The issue of concern is the radiolytic generation and accumulation of hydrogen and other <b>explosive</b> gases in <b>waste</b> containers. The wattage limits that existed through 1996 restricted the amount of plutonium bearing hydrogenous materials that could be packaged in a WIPP bound waste drum to {{only a fraction of}} the capacity of a drum. Typically, only about one kilogram of combustible residue could be packaged in a waste drum before the wattage limit was exceeded resulting in an excessively large number of drums to be procured, stored, shipped, and interred. The Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site has initiated the use of filtered plastic bags (called bag-out bags) used to remove transuranic waste materials from glove box lines. The bags contain small, disk like HEPA filters which are effective in containing radioactively contaminated particulate material but allow for the diffusion of hydrogen gas. Used in conjunction with filtered 55 gallon drums, filtered bag-out bags were pursued as a means to increase the allowable wattage limits for selected residue materials. In February 1997, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the use of filtered bag-out bags for transuranic waste materials destined for WIPP. The concomitant increase in wattage limits now allows for approximately four times the payload per waste drum for wattage limited materials...|$|R
40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} {{the use of the}} Molten Salt Destruction (MSD) Process for destroying explosives, liquid gun propellant, and explosives-contaminated materials on a 1. 5 kg of explosive/hr bench- scale unit (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). In our recently constructed 5 kg/hr pilot- scale unit we have also demonstrated the destruction of a liquid gun propellant and simulated wastes containing HMX (octogen). MSD converts the organic constituents of the waste into non-hazardous substances such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and water. Any inorganic constituents of the waste, such as metallic particles, are retained in the molten salt. The destruction of energetic materials waste is accomplished by introducing it, together with air, into a vessel containing molten salt (a eutectic mixture of sodium, potassium, and lithium carbonates). The following pure explosives have been destroyed in our bench-scale experimental unit located at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory`s (LLNL) High Explosives Applications Facility (HEAF) : ammonium picrate, HMX, K- 6 (keto-RDX), NQ, NTO, PETN, RDX, TATB, and TNT. In addition, the following compositions were also destroyed: Comp B, LX- IO, LX- 1 6, LX- 17, PBX- 9404, and XM 46 (liquid gun propellant). In this 1. 5 kg/hr bench-scale unit, the fractions of carbon converted to CO and of chemically bound nitrogen converted to NO{sub x} were found to be well below 1 %. In addition to destroying explosive powders and compositions we have also destroyed materials that are typical of residues which result from explosives operations. These include shavings from machined pressed parts of plastic-bonded <b>explosives</b> and sump <b>waste</b> containing both <b>explosives</b> and non-explosive debris. Based on the process data obtained on the bench-scale unit we designed and constructed a next-generation 5 kg/hr pilot-scale unit, incorporating LLNL`s advanced chimney design. The pilot unit has completed process implementation operations and explosives safety reviews. To date, in this pilot unit we have successfully destroyed liquid gun propellant and dimethylsulfoxide containing HMX in continuous, long-duration runs...|$|R
