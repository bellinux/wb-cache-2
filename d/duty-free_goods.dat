5|$|In 1955, Air Kruise {{moved to}} Lydd (Ferryfield) and Lympne was re-licensed in 1955. On 30 September 1955, Eric Rylands, a former {{co-owner}} and {{managing director of}} the Lancashire Aircraft Corporation (LAC) who had bought Skyways from the previous owners in March 1952 (together with LAC's other owner, David Brown), started a coach-air service between London and Paris. Passengers were taken by coach from Victoria Coach Station to Lympne, flown to Beauvais and then taken by coach to Paris. Check-in and coach departures in Paris were at the Hôtel Moderne Palace on Place de la Republique in Paris 12. Aircraft and coaches each held 36 passengers. Passengers returning to the UK could order <b>duty-free</b> <b>goods</b> at Paris and the orders were telephoned to Beauvais for distribution on the flight. The off-peak fare was £7 14s 0d and 47,000 passengers were carried in the first year. Three Dakotas were used initially and later increasing to four. A trial run took place on 21 September and Skyways holding company, Eric Rylands Ltd, bought Lympne from the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation in 1956.|$|E

25|$|By 1600, trading colonies {{had grown}} up {{on either side of}} the well-travelled {{shipping}} routes: the Dutch settled along the eastern seaboard of Scotland; the Scots congregating first in Campvere—where they were allowed to land their <b>goods</b> <b>duty-free</b> and run their own affairs—and then in Rotterdam, where Scottish and Dutch Calvinism coexisted comfortably. Besides the thousands (or, according to one estimate, over 1 million) of local descendants with Scots ancestry, both ports still show signs of these early alliances. Now a museum, 'The Scots House' in the town of Veere was the only place outwith Scotland where Scots Law was practised. In Rotterdam, meanwhile, the doors of the Scots International Church have remained open since 1643.|$|R

50|$|A vicious {{contest for}} saw mills and teak forests owned by British {{companies}} erupted early on, followed by similar disputes over {{the control of}} enemy energy and shipping facilities within the country. Other problems were more severe. For a time Germany continued actively purchasing Thai products, but once shipping difficulties became intractable, Japan became Thailand's sole significant trading partner. Similarly, Thailand {{had to rely on}} the Japanese for consumer goods previously imported from Europe and the United States, which Japan was increasingly unable to provide as the war wore on. A shortage of commodities quickly developed, with inflation soaring and standards of living dropping. Worse still, the Japanese had aggressively claimed the right to import <b>goods</b> <b>duty-free,</b> significantly reducing Thai government revenues.|$|R

The City of Paris provided the Duke with a house at 4 Route du Champ d'Entraînement, on the Neuilly-sur-Seine {{side of the}} Bois de Boulogne, for a nominal rent. The French government exempted him from paying income tax, and the couple were able to buy <b>goods</b> <b>duty-free</b> through the British embassy and the military commissary. In 1951, the Duke produced a ghost-written memoir, A King's Story, in which he expressed disagreement with liberal politics. The royalties from the book added to their income.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the risks of}} preference erosion arising from MFN trade liberalization in manufactured products. It focuses on developing countries that receive non-reciprocal preferences in the markets of United States, EU, Japan, Canada and Australia. The paper estimates preference margins as the difference between non-reciprocal preferential rates received by individual countries and the best available (MFN or better-than-MFN) treatment received on average by all other suppliers. Most previous work on this subject has compared the preferential rates for individual countries with MFN rates alone, which the paper found to {{have the effect of}} over-stating the margin at risk from erosion following MFN reductions. The paper finds that developing countries as a whole do not loose from preference erosion following MFN liberalization, although significant gains and losses underlie the estimate of the average. Almost all least-developed countries either lose from preference erosion or are unaffected by it because their exports are already largely MFN <b>duty-free.</b> MFN, manufactured <b>goods,</b> non-reciprocal preferences, WTO, LDC,Economics, International Economic Relations, Trade...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper briefly reviews new {{indices of}} trade restrictiveness and trade {{facilitation}} {{that have been}} developed at the World Bank. The paper also compares the trade impact of different types of trade restrictions applied at the border with the effects of domestic policies that affect trade costs. Based on a gravity regression framework, the analysis suggests that tariffs and non-tariff measures continue to be a significant source of trade restrictiveness for low-income countries despite preferential access programs. This is because the value of trade preferences is quite limited: a new measure of the relative preference margin developed in the paper reveals that this is very low for most country-pairs. Most countries with very <b>good</b> (<b>duty-free)</b> access to a market generally have competitors that have the same degree of access. The empirical analysis suggests that measures to improve logistics performance and facilitate trade are likely to have the greatest positive effects in expanding developing country trade, increasing the trade impacts of lowering remaining border barriers by a factor of two or more...|$|R

50|$|On 4 July 1995, The Conference {{formally}} admitted Suriname as {{the fourteenth}} Member of the Caribbean Community, following the deposit of the Instruments of Accession to the Treaty of Chaguaramas and the Common Market Annex. The instrument of Accession to the Common Market made provision for Suriname {{to implement the}} arrangements relating to the Common Market effective 1 January 1996. Suriname's accession to the Community and the Common Market led to significant changes in Suriname's external trade policy as prior to accession, a multiple tariff regime ranging from 0 to 100 percent under the Brussels Tariff Nomenclature (BTN) classification system was in force. In preparation for CARICOM membership, this system was replaced in 1994 with the Harmonized System (HS) {{used as the basis}} for determining <b>duty-free</b> entry of <b>goods</b> of CARICOM origin and for applying the common external tariff. Suriname's 1996 entry into the free trade area was immediate with no major transition phase contemplated in the accession agreement apart from some exceptions granted under the Treaty of Chaguaramas and a few others negotiated by Suriname upon entry.|$|R
5000|$|Between 1 August 1965 and 30 June 1999 {{there was}} a ferry service between Faaborg, on Fyn in Denmark, and Germany, with ferry lines running across Gelting Bay to Gelting Pier. Since the ferry {{distance}} was 28 nautical miles and led outside the then territorial waters, the shipping company assumed a business model which, {{in addition to the}} ferry service and the management of fast restaurants and cafeterias, had a substantial sale of goods at tax-free prices. These so-called [...] "butter cruises" [...] (Butterfahrten) contributed to a tourist boom around Gelting Bay. According to a decision by the European Union (EU) to stop the <b>duty-free</b> sales of <b>goods</b> within EU countries, not only did sales on board the ferry decline, but so did the number of passengers on the so-called butter cruises. The shipping company that ran the Faaborg - Gelting Mole Line therefore discontinued the ferry service on Gelting Bay on 30 June 1999 due to its lack of profitability. Some of the technical facilities of the Gelting Mole landing stage have since been dismantled..|$|R
