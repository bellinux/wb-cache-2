Don't weep for Buck. No, man, be happy, be thankful.|$|E
500|$|Brosnan has {{expressed}} contempt for his education by the Christian Brothers. However, in 2013 he commented, [...] "It always {{helps to have}} a bit of prayer in your back pocket. At the end of the day, you have to have something and for me that is God, Jesus, my Catholic upbringing, my faith... God has been <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> My faith has been <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in the moments of deepest suffering, doubt and fear. It is a constant, the language of prayer... I might not have got my sums right from the Christian Brothers or might not have got the greatest learning of literature from them but I certainly got a strapping amount of faith." [...] Brosnan attends Mass, but adheres to other spiritual beliefs. In 2008 he said [...] "I also love the teachings of Buddhist philosophy. It's my own private faith. I don't preach it, but it's a faith that is a comfort to me when the night is long." ...|$|E
500|$|The name on {{his birth}} {{certificate}} was Wayland, meaning land by the highway. His name was changed after a Baptist preacher visited Jennings's parents and congratulated his mother for naming {{him after the}} Wayland Baptist University in Plainview, Texas. Lorene Jennings, who had been unaware of the college, changed the spelling to Waylon. Jennings later expressed in his autobiography, [...] "I didn't like Waylon. It sounded corny and hillbilly, but it's been <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and I'm pretty well at peace with it right now." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2008, UMBC again faced Albany in the America East {{championship}} game. Halfway {{through the}} second period, the Retrievers trailed 11–2, but rallied to edge their opponents, 14–13. Zimmerman was named the 2008 America East Coach of the Year. In June, he was considered the frontrunner to replace John Haus who had been fired as North Carolina's head coach, but Zimmerman removed his name from consideration. He said, [...] "The people at UMBC have been <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> {{and this is my}} home ... these are my kids and I recruited them. I just didn't think this was the right time to move." [...] UMBC granted Zimmerman a contract extension through the 2014 season.|$|E
500|$|Before the 1905 season got underway, Schulz {{contracted}} malaria in the spring. [...] Newspapers {{reported it}} was a [...] "serious attack" [...] and that he [...] "has been quite ill", but {{he was able to}} recuperate before the 1905 football season. [...] In October 1905, Coach Yost said: [...] "In looking over the whole bunch, I do not see anyone who has improved more than Schulz. [...] He is bigger and stronger than ever, and I do not know a man in the world that has it the least bit over him in the center position. [...] I would not trade him for any other center rush in the country today. [...] He looks <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> for the All-America team right now". [...] Though he was not selected for the All-America team in 1905, Schulz did receive All-Western honors.|$|E
500|$|In September 1976, Alston {{announced}} that he would retire {{at the end of the}} season. At a press conference, Alston said, [...] "I've been in baseball for 41 years and it's been awfully <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> This has been a pretty big day. I had three birdies playing golf for the first time in my life and now I'm announcing that I'm stepping down as manager. I told Peter this afternoon to give somebody else a chance to manage the club." [...] Alston retired with 2,063 wins (2,040 in the regular season and 23 in the postseason). Alston was named NL Manager of the Year six times. He also managed NL All-Star squads a record nine times and won seven of those games. At a time when multi-year contracts were on the rise, Alston's managerial career consisted of 23 one-year contracts. He earned seven NL pennants in that span.|$|E

500|$|The {{first officer}} {{described}} the snowfall as [...] "not heavy, no large flakes." [...] He told authorities that snow was sliding off the jet and {{the nose of}} the airplane was coated in a watery layer. He used a light positioned on the wing of his jet to check for signs of ice several times before they attempted to take off. Neither he or the pilot saw any evidence of contamination on the wing or on the black strip and therefore decided against a third deicing. He told investigators that he checked the wings [...] "maybe 10 times, but at least 3." [...] He said that he did not consider the snowfall heavy, and he did not recall any wind blowing the snow. The first officer stated that as they taxied, they looked back at the wings several times. Near the time of the takeoff, he said [...] "looks <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> black strip is clear." ...|$|E
500|$|That {{night at}} the Marott Hotel, Kennedy hosted a meeting with 14 local black leaders. The meeting had been {{arranged}} before the assassination by aide James Tolan and took place in Tolan's room. The group had debated among themselves {{as to whether they}} should hold the meeting. Kennedy eventually arrived, and the conversation quickly became heated as leaders accused him of being an unreliable member of [...] "the white establishment." [...] He lost his temper, saying, [...] "I don't need all this aggravation. I could sit next to my swimming pool. You know, God's been <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and I really don't need anything. But I just feel that if He's been that good, I should try to put something back in. And you all call yourselves leaders and you've been moaning and groaning about personal problems. You haven't once talked about your own people." [...] The meeting ended with most attendees pledging their support to Kennedy's campaign. One of them later acknowledged that Kennedy was [...] "completely sympathetic and understanding".|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Harry Shearer criticized what he {{perceived}} as the show's declining quality: [...] "I rate {{the last three seasons}} as among the worst, so season four looks very <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> now." [...] Dan Castellaneta responded: [...] "I don't agree,... I think Harry's issue is that the show isn't as grounded {{as it was in the}} first three or four seasons, that it's gotten crazy or a little more madcap. I think it organically changes to stay fresh." [...] Also in 2004 author Douglas Coupland described claims of declining quality in the series as [...] "hogwash", saying [...] "The Simpsons hasn't fumbled the ball in fourteen years, it's hardly likely to fumble it now." [...] In an April 2006 interview, Groening said: [...] "I honestly don't see any end in sight. I think it's possible that the show will become too financially cumbersome... but right now, the show is creatively, I think, as good or better than it's ever been. The animation is incredibly detailed and imaginative, and the stories do things that we haven't done before. So creatively there's no reason to quit." ...|$|E

500|$|As the {{examination}} continued, Aylmer considered {{the ability of}} the Anglican Church to put trained ministers in every parish. [...] He barked, [...] "This fellow would have a preacher in every parish church!" [...] to which Marbury replied, [...] "so would St. Paul." [...] Then Aylmer asked, [...] "But where is the living for them?" [...] To this Marbury answered, [...] "A man might cut a large thong out of your hide, and that of the other prelates, and it would never be missed." [...] Having lost his patience, the bishop retorted, [...] "Thou are an overthwart, proud, puritan knave." [...] Marbury answered, [...] "I am no puritan. [...] I beseech you to be <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> [...] I have been twice in prison already, but I know not why. [...] To this, Aylmer was unsympathetic, and he rendered the sentence, [...] "Have him to the Marshalsea. [...] There he shall cope with the papists." [...] Marbury then actually threatened divine retribution upon the bishop by warning him to beware the judgements of God. [...] His daughter Anne would make a similar threat towards the magistrates and ministers at her civil trial before the Massachusetts Court, nearly 60 years later.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Shearer criticized what he {{perceived}} as the show's declining quality: [...] "I rate {{the last three seasons}} as among the worst, so season four looks very <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> now." [...] Shearer has also been vocal about [...] "The Principal and the Pauper" [...] (season nine, 1997) {{one of the most controversial}} episodes of The Simpsons. Many fans and critics reacted negatively to the revelation that Principal Seymour Skinner, a recurring character since the first season, was an impostor. The episode has been criticized by both Shearer and Groening. In a 2001 interview, Shearer recalled that after reading the script, he told the writers, [...] "That's so wrong. You're taking something that an audience has built eight years or nine years of investment in and just tossed it in the trash can for no good reason, for a story we've done before with other characters. It's so arbitrary and gratuitous, and it's disrespectful to the audience." [...] Due to scheduling and availability conflicts, Shearer decided not to participate in The Simpsons Ride, which opened in 2008, so none of his characters have vocal parts and many do not appear in the ride at all. In a 2010 interview on The Howard Stern Show, Shearer alluded that the reason he was not part of the ride was because he would not be getting paid for it.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Give It Away" [...] {{was made by}} French fashion {{photographer}} and director Stéphane Sednaoui. Kiedis wanted the video to be visually distinct and readily identifiable but disliked much of the material Warner Bros. sent for him to choose from: [...] "I started viewing reels and reels and reels of video directors but nothing looked <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Everything was the same, boring, homogenized, contrived shit." [...] Upon finding Sednaoui's reel, however, Kiedis noticed it was [...] "like nothing else. It was slower and poetic, shot in black and white. It seemed like authentic art, not something shot for MTV." [...] He and Flea met with Sednaoui {{to talk about the}} video, for which the director proposed a [...] "very desolated [...] very graphic landscape," [...] while heavily focusing on the band members with little to no outside influence. It was decided that the video would be filmed in black and white while Sednaoui took the idea of painting the band members with silver acrylic from previous photo shoots he had done. Sednaoui recalls that he was [...] "amazed by what [...] gave me because they went far far far beyond what I was expecting and I think that's one of my best experiences in that regard". The overall mood of the video was intended to be a personification of the song, which is upbeat and lively.|$|E

500|$|Veronica Mars has {{attracted}} a loyal and dedicated fan base. A group of fans calling themselves the [...] "Cloud Watchers" [...] organized several campaigns to bring more viewers to the series to ensure its continuation. The group hired a plane to fly over the CW offices, carrying a banner reading [...] "Renew Veronica Mars". The group hired street teams in New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Chicago to distribute 30,000 fliers advertising the series' return after its midseason hiatus in the third season. The [...] "Cloud Watchers" [...] raised $50,000 in donations and through the sale of Veronica Mars clothing and tchotchkes. Upon the cancellation of the series, fans sent more than 10,000 Mars Bars to the CW, hoping that the network would reverse its decision and renew the series. Rob Thomas thanked the fans of the series for their efforts, saying [...] "I love those people {{and they have been}} so <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> but it's not going to happen." [...] A feature film continuation was made possible in 2013 through a Kickstarter fund, in which 91,585 fans donated $5,702,153 to get the film made. Fans have also come to refer to themselves and be referred to as [...] "Marshmallows" [...] by media as well as the cast and crew of the series after a line delivered by Wallace (Percy Daggs III) in the pilot episode: [...] "You're a marshmallow, Veronica Mars. A Twinkie." [...] At the end of the same episode, Veronica in voiceover remarks [...] "Well, you know what they say: 'Veronica Mars, she's a marshmallow.'" [...] A reference to the term was also included in the fan-funded film.|$|E
