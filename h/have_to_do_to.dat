[...] Weiner said in August 2012 that he intended for Peggy's departure from SCDP to be in [...] "The Other Woman", which is centered on Joan: [...] " [...] literally about the quantification and value {{of women in the}} workplace and the relationship of their sexuality to it. I knew that on a subconscious level at the writing stage, {{because of the way the}} stories went together. As these stories fold in together, it starts to become about that, but it was always about what you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> get ahead, in a very simple way, and the opportunities to get ahead." ...|$|E
500|$|On February 9, 1920, Morrow {{dispatched}} the Kentucky National Guard to Lexington {{to protect}} Will Lockett, a black World WarI veteran {{on trial for}} murder. Morrow told the state adjutant general [...] "Do {{as much as you}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> keep that negro {{in the hands of the}} law. If he falls into the hands of the mob I do not expect to see you alive." [...] Lockett had already confessed, without the benefit of a lawyer, to the murder. His trial took only thirty minutes as he pleaded guilty but asked for a life sentence instead of death. Despite his plea, he was sentenced to die in the electric chair.|$|E
500|$|According to Lee, several core {{concepts}} {{were already}} in place from Buck and Del Vecho's early work, such as the film's [...] "frozen heart" [...] hook: [...] "That was a concept and the phrase... an act of true love will thaw a frozen heart." [...] They already knew the ending involved true love {{in the sense of}} the emotional bond between siblings, not romance, in that [...] "Anna was going to save Elsa. We didn’t know how or why." [...] Lee said Edwin Catmull, president of Disney Animation, told her early on about the film's ending: [...] "First and foremost, no matter what you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> the story, do it. But you have to earn that ending. If you do it will be great. If you don't, it will suck." ...|$|E

500|$|Several of {{the songs}} on the album drew their lyrics from real life relationships. [...] "Peachy" [...] {{documents}} the permanent breakup of a relationship that had inspired her 2004 single [...] "Ten Days". [...] "Where I Stood", which Higgins calls [...] "a pretty sad love song", describes the end of another relationship. She said it portrays [...] "one of those situations where you just feel that leaving this person is something you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> get to know yourself again." [...] "Secret" [...] was about an ex-girlfriend who was uncomfortable about going public with their relationship; [...] "I was so head over heels {{in love with her}} I kind of wanted to shout it out to the world, so it was just a song about keeping something under the covers ... keeping it away locked in a little room." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite Travolta's earlier statements, {{plans for}} a sequel never came to fruition. According to James Robert Parish's Fiasco: A History of Hollywood's Iconic Flops, the {{disastrous}} performance of Battlefield Earth {{and the collapse of}} Franchise Pictures made it very unlikely that a live-action sequel will be made. In a 2001 interview, Travolta stated that a sequel was not planned: [...] "Ultimately the movie did $100million when you count box office, DVD sales, video, and pay per view… But I don't know what kind of number it would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> justify filming {{the second part of the}} book. And I don't want to push any buttons in the press and stir anybody up about it now." [...] Author Services announced in 2001 that Pine Com International, a Tokyo-based animation studio, would produce 13one-hour animated television segments based on the book and rendered in a manga style. The plans appear to have fallen through, and according to Parish, [...] "little has been heard of the series since." ...|$|E
500|$|Christian Clemenson went to Harvard with Cuse {{but still}} {{went through the}} normal {{audition}} channels to get the part of Poole. Clemenson was apprehensive about pursuing one of the lead roles in a television show because of the long time commitments involved. He later said, [...] "The similarities between this show and The Wild Wild West, and my character to that show's Artemus Gordon, was an important hook for me. It {{was one of my}} favorite shows growing up, and as soon as I saw that Brisco County was based on the same kind of material and attitude as that show, I called my agent and said, 'I'll do anything I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> get this. Clemenson applied his experiences at Ivy League schools to play the uptight Poole. Praising Clemenson's work on Brisco, Cuse said, [...] "You can't give him anything he's not capable of doing. He adds the voice of intelligence and caution to balance our cast".|$|E

50|$|Many ancient peoples {{recognized}} a religious right of asylum, protecting criminals (or those accused of crime) from legal action and from exile to some extent.

500|$|Lecrae {{attended}} a conference after being invited by a friend, though Lecrae admits that his interest {{was to meet}} girls and experience the big city. When {{he arrived at the}} conference, Lecrae was awed by the performance of the Christian hip-hop group The Cross Movement. Lecrae says that he saw [...] "guys who had been shot from being in gangs, girls who were extremely promiscuous in the past, I see rappers, dancers and singers; I see people who came from the same background I came from, and they still embodied who they were culturally, but they were all in love with Jesus and I had never seen that before." [...] After hearing Pastor James White of Christ Our King Community Church speak on how Christians are bought with a price and the suffering that Jesus underwent in the Crucifixion, Lecrae says that he remembers articulating [...] "God get me out of this, don't kill me; do whatever you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> get me out of this, just don't kill me." [...] Later, Lecrae was driving on a highway when he turned too quickly and his car went into a roll. He had no seatbelt and the roof and windshield of the car caved in, his glasses were molded into the frame of the car, but he survived completely uninjured. Lecrae cites this incident as the one which convinced him to commit his life to Christ. Lecrae went back to his college, the University of North Texas, with a printed version of his testimony to pass out on campus. He started volunteering and performing at a juvenile detention center, and the reception he received convinced him that offering [...] "hope and encouragement" [...] through music was what he wanted to do. However, Lecrae still struggled in his faith − as revealed in [...] "Good, Bad, Ugly", in 2002 he impregnated a then-girlfriend. Rather than risk scandal, he and his girlfriend had the baby aborted, a decision he says he now deeply regrets. In the same song, he revealed that he had been sexually abused by a babysitter as a child.|$|E
2500|$|Heading {{into the}} 2010 season, Jones was not {{mentioned}} {{among the top}} contenders on the Roughriders to replace departing defensive linemen John Chick and Stevie Baggs, which suited him fine, [...] "I’m always the undersized guy at my position. There are things that I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> remain a Roughrider but I know that I’m in a fight. Then again, I’m always fighting." [...] Jones also sees significant playing time on special teams, where he is considered {{by some to be}} among the CFL's best.|$|E
2500|$|As soon as {{the results}} of the March 9, 2008 {{primaries}} were announced, NPP's Second Vice President, Miriam Ramírez de Ferrer, announced her immediate resignation, saying [...] "Effectively right now I am no longer the Second Vice President of this party. You will not see me ever again involved in active politics, party reunions or party meetings, as I now plan to become a private citizen. There's a lot of things I haven't done I want to do, and I'll also do some things I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> help the statehood cause". Ramírez was a candidate for Resident Commissioner in the primaries and was openly supporting Rosselló. She lost to Fortuño's candidate, Pedro Pierluisi, and to another Rosselló supporter who was also defeated, former Senate President, Charlie Rodríguez. When Ramírez was asked by the media if she will vote for Fortuño, she replied [...] "My vote is secret".|$|E

40|$|Abstract The 2013 Defence White Paper places greater {{emphasis}} than its predecessors on defence engagement, {{and begins to}} link regional security to the defence of Australia itself. It does not explain, however, what Australia <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> achieve its objectives, or what commitments it would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> enter <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. Overall, the White Paper moves towards a reinterpretation of ‘self-reliance’ that focuses more {{on the way in}} which Australia would operate in a coalition conflict, but developing a new defence strategy that links force structure, posture and employment to the achievement of Australia’s strategic objectives is left to future White Papers...|$|R

2500|$|GameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann {{was less}} impressed, scoring the PC version 6 out of 10, the PS2 version 6.4 out of 10 and the Xbox version 6.6 out of 10, and calling the game [...] "a foul-mouthed and bloody {{adventure}} that does {{next to nothing}} with the characters [...] The whole experience feels flat and often self-conscious." [...] Of the PC version, he wrote [...] "even on machines that go way beyond the game's recommended system requirements, we noticed plenty of frame rate trouble and slowdown. The textures aren't pretty, and overall, the game looks like a quick and dirty console port." [...] He concluded [...] "Overall, Scarface: The World Is Yours is more a victim of some poor design choices than any glaring technical issues. [...] by taking the focus off of the gameplay elements that you'd want in an open-city game and putting it more on the game's bland mission design and all the dull side tasks you'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> earn a reputation, Scarface doesn't play to its potential strengths. The end result is a functional game that presents an interesting premise, but underneath you'll find a wholly uninteresting game." [...] He was even more critical of the Wii version, scoring it 5.8 out of 10, writing [...] "the gamepad-to-Wii Remote transition has made this lackluster game play even worse." [...] He was extremely critical of the controls; [...] "while it's somewhat impressive on some level that the developer managed to cram a standard gamepad-controlled game onto the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, it's never fun to play, and you'll feel like you're fighting the controls from start to finish." ...|$|E

'The {{book which}} has {{interested}} me most, lately, {{is that on}} [...] "Mosaism," [...] translated by Miss Goldsmid, and which I read, as you will believe, without any Christian (unchristian?) prejudice. The missionaries of the Unity were always, from my childhood, regarded by me as in that sense the people; and I believe they were true to that mission, though blind, intellectually, in demanding the crucifixion. The present aspect of Jewish opinions, as shown in that book, is all but Christian. The author is under the error of taking, as the representatives of Christianity, the Mystics, Ascetics, and Quietists; and therefore {{he does not know}} how near he is to the true spirit of the gospel. If you should happen to see Miss Goldsmid, pray tell her what a great service I think she has rendered to us soi-disant Christians in translating a book which must make us sensible of the little we have done, and the much we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>to</b> justify our preference of the later to the earlier dispensation.'

6000|$|But this {{involved}} {{accuracy of}} the thing makes {{it very difficult to}} do what I now <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>to</b> describe this accumulation of truth. It is very hard for a man to defend anything of which he is entirely convinced. It is comparatively easy when he is only partially convinced. He is partially convinced because he has found this or that proof of the thing, and he can expound it. But a man is not really convinced of a philosophic theory when he finds that something proves it. He is only really convinced when he finds that everything proves it. And the more converging reasons he finds pointing to this conviction, the more bewildered he is if asked suddenly to sum them up. Thus, if one asked an ordinary intelligent man, {{on the spur of the}} moment, [...] "Why do you prefer civilization to savagery?" [...] he would look wildly round at object after object, and would only be able to answer vaguely, [...] "Why, there is that bookcase [...] . and the coals in the coal-scuttle [...] . and pianos [...] . and policemen." [...] The whole case for civilization is that the case for it is complex. It has done so many things.
