5|$|The {{development}} of the baronial castles in England were affected by the economic changes during the period. During the 13th and 14th centuries the average <b>incomes</b> <b>of</b> the English barons increased but wealth became concentrated {{in the hands of}} a smaller number of individuals, with a greater discrepancy in incomes. At the same time the costs of maintaining and staffing a modern castle were increasing. The result was that although there were around 400 castles in England in 1216, the number of castles continued to diminish over the coming years; even the wealthier barons were inclined to let some castles slide into disuse and to focus their resources on the remaining stock. The castle-guard system faded into abeyance in England, being replaced by financial rents, although it continued in the Welsh Marches well into the 13th century and saw some limited use during Edward I's occupation of Scotland in the early 14th century.|$|E
5|$|Farm incomes {{have fallen}} {{over the years}} as a result of cheap food {{policies}} in the United Kingdom, the lowering of world commodity prices and the removal of production-based subsidies. Particularly hard hit have been the <b>incomes</b> <b>of</b> hill farms in Wales which averaged £15,000 in 2014, as against £23,000 for lowland livestock farms and £59,000 for dairy farms. The labour force has been dwindling for many years as a result of increased mechanisation and changes in farming practices. Fewer farmers are needed today because they are able to produce more food from their land. Hay is no longer the main source of winter feed for livestock and has largely been replaced by silage, particularly baled silage wrapped in film that can be handled mechanically. This has reduced the manpower needed on farms, and there has been an increase of use by farmers of specialised contractors who provide services in silage making, harvesting and fencing. Another problem facing Welsh farmers is their distance from the main distribution centres used by supermarkets which are mostly located near centres of population in England.|$|E

30|$|We derive Eq. (7) as follows. First, {{we start}} from the {{definition}} of RP_TI,t in an analogous formulation to the one used in Eq. (1) for the total income 80 / 20 ratio. Then, we split the right-hand side into the components corresponding to the labor income and the non-labor <b>income</b> <b>of</b> the richest quintile. After that, we divide the numerator and denominator of the first term (the per capita labor <b>income</b> <b>of</b> the richest quintile over the per capita total <b>income</b> <b>of</b> the poorest quintile) by the per capita labor <b>income</b> <b>of</b> the poorest quintile. Analogously, we divide the second term (the per capita non-labor <b>income</b> <b>of</b> the richest quintile over the per capita total <b>income</b> <b>of</b> the poorest quintile) by the per capita non-labor <b>income</b> <b>of</b> the poorest quintile.
