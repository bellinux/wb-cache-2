5|$|All three {{leaders of}} North Korea—Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il, and Kim Jong-un—have been smokers {{and the country}} <b>has</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> balance their public image with its anti-smoking efforts. In general, North Koreans tend to prefer strong tobacco and {{different}} classes of quality range from homegrown to sought-after foreign brands that are considered status symbols. As {{a percentage of the}} available arable land compared to consumption, the tobacco crop is over-represented in North Korean agriculture.|$|E
5|$|After the elation {{of change}} {{following}} group {{action in the}} 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City, in the late 1970s and the early 1980s, some gays and lesbians became less accepting of bisexual or transgender people. Critics said that transgender people were acting out stereotypes and bisexuals were simply gay men or lesbian women who were afraid {{to come out and}} be honest about their identity. Each community <b>has</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> develop its own identity including whether, and how, to align with other gender and sexuality-based communities, at times excluding other subgroups; these conflicts continue to this day. LGBTQ activists and artists have created posters to raise consciousness about the issue since the movement began.|$|E

5|$|Because of poor-quality soil, much of Wales is {{unsuitable}} for crop-growing and livestock farming {{has traditionally been}} the focus of agriculture. The Welsh landscape (protected by three national parks) and 45 Blue Flag beaches, as well as the unique culture of Wales, attract large numbers of tourists, who play an especially vital role in the economy of rural areas. Wales <b>has</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> develop or attract high value-added employment in sectors such as finance and research and development, attributable in part to a comparative lack of 'economic mass' (i.e. population) – Wales lacks a large metropolitan centre. The lack of high value-added employment is reflected in lower economic output per head relative to other regions of the UK – in 2002 it stood at 90% of the EU25 average and around 80% of the UK average. In June 2008, Wales made history by becoming the first nation in the world to be awarded Fairtrade Status.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the five}} games, Dead Phoenix was {{canceled}} and only P.N.03 retained {{its status as}} a GameCube exclusive, though it was a critical and commercial failure. Both Viewtiful Joe and Killer7 sold modestly, the former despite critical acclaim and the latter owing to polarized reviews. Even so, Killer7 gained a significant cult following, effectively launching the career of director Suda51. Resident Evil 4 was the runaway success of the five, though its GameCube sales were undercut by the announcement of a Sony PlayStation 2 port to be released later in 2005. Viewtiful Joe also saw a PlayStation 2 version with expanded features, and Killer7 debuted on multiple platforms simultaneously. Since the release of the Nintendo 64, Nintendo <b>has</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> attract third-party developers like Capcom to produce games for its systems. Industry analysts see the Capcom Five case, particularly the loss of GameCube exclusivity for Resident Evil 4, as a major blow to Nintendo–Capcom relations and is emblematic of Nintendo's failure to attract third-party support during the GameCube era.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the Macintosh, Apple <b>has</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> gain a significant share of the personal computer market. At first, the Macintosh 128K suffered from a dearth of available software compared to IBM's PC, resulting in disappointing sales in 1984 and 1985. It took 74days for 50,000units to sell. Although Apple was not able to overcome the tidal wave of IBM PCs and its clones, Macintosh systems found success in education and desktop publishing.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the period, Zimbabwe's {{financial}} condition deeply worsened.

Zimbabwe players have threatened boycott many times of late and have formed a players' Union. Zimbabwe team <b>has</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> attract sponsors and this has affected its domestic structure leading to cancellation of many tournaments such as Pro40. A number of franchises also have been cancelled. Multiple tours have been postponed, cancelled or have gone un-televised.|$|E
25|$|Among {{advanced}} players, {{there is}} little argument about whether technological changes have enabled higher scoring. The general consensus has been that they have. Yet {{there are those who}} have seen their scores decline, often because they did not change their technique or bowling balls appropriately. Some argue that such high technology unfairly affects competition, making high scores too dependent on how much money one spends on equipment. The USBC, for various reasons, <b>has</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> regulate these changes well enough to protect the integrity of their honor score award program.|$|E
