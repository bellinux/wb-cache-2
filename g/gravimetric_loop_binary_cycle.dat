40|$|Abstract: Coal, natural gas, {{and nuclear}} power plants operate using various forms of Rankine cycle. A variant of Rankine <b>cycle</b> known as <b>binary</b> <b>cycle</b> has been {{implemented}} in power plants; yet, the optimization of <b>binary</b> <b>cycles</b> remains relatively unexplored. This article is concerned with efficiency maximization of <b>binary</b> <b>cycle</b> by investigating various working fluid materials for different operating conditions. We introduce a novel analysis approach by employing Redlich– Kwong equation of state to derive a simple, effective way to express the efficiency of <b>binary</b> <b>cycles</b> suitable for most working fluids. Five alkali metals and mercury are investigated for the topping cycle and two fluids for the bottoming cycle. The results show that for operating conditions o...|$|R

40|$|Geothermal {{reservoirs}} may be liquid- or vapor- dominated. Two {{types of}} power cycle {{will be considered}} in this paper for liquid-dominated reservoirs, the vapor flashing <b>cycle</b> and the <b>binary</b> <b>cycle</b> using isobutane as the working fluid. In vapor flashing cycle, flashing tanks are used to separate steam from brine, and the steam expands in turbine to generate power. In <b>binary</b> <b>cycle,</b> the working fluid is superheated by geothermal fluid and then expands in turbine for power generation. Addition of a regenerator to <b>binary</b> <b>cycle</b> improves the thermal efficiency. For identical conditions of geothermal fluid, the power generated by a regenerative <b>binary</b> <b>cycle</b> is slightly {{higher than that of}} basic <b>binary</b> <b>cycle.</b> Another advantage of the regenerative <b>binary</b> <b>cycle</b> is that the heat rejection rate of the system is lowered by using the regenerator. Geothermal fluid from well may exist in two phases, vapor and liquid, if the fluid in well is self-flowing. To avoid scaling, submersible pump may be used to force the fluid out of a well. When pump is used, there will be no vapor at the wellhead. Effects of pumping on power output and heat rejection of <b>binary</b> <b>cycle</b> have been evaluated in Section III. For geothermal fluids with high content of non-condensable gases, a non-condensing plant may be used. Condensing plants have much higher thermal efficiencies than non-condensing plants. If cooling water to condenser is not accessible, a cooling tower can be used to recycle the cooling water. At the end of this paper is an evaluation of multi-effect evaporator used to produce fresh water from the waste brine of regenerative binary plant...|$|R

40|$|DOE is {{particularly}} concerned with reducing {{the costs of}} geothermal power generation, especially with the abundant moderate to low-temperature resources in the US.

Projects which focus on the costs and performance of <b>binary</b> <b>cycle</b> technology include a commercial demonstration of supersaturated turbine expansions, which earlier studies have indicated could increase the power produced per pound of fluid. Other <b>binary</b> <b>cycle</b> projects include evaluations of the performance of various working fluid mixtures and the development and testing of advanced heat rejection systems which are desperately needed in water-short geothermal areas.

40|$|Acomputermodelofasolidoxidefuelcell(SOFC) wasimplementedwithanumberof {{operational}} {{options to}} evaluate {{the best use of}} the cell waste heat. The simplest solution for heat recovery is represented by adopting a pressurized fuel cell with the eventual expansion of the exhaust stream in a gas turbine. Other alternatives feature the adoption of various closed cycle recovery systems: a standard steam cycle, an inter-refrigerated helium cycle, and an advanced <b>binary</b> <b>cycle.</b> Assuming a fuel energy input of 100 MW, the overall efficiency of a hybrid cell was computed, which was much higher than that of a small capacity (100 kW) existing plant (67 versus ∼ 53 per cent). Such high efficiency hybrid SOFC systems were taken as the reference {{to evaluate the}} performance of alternate options. Reclaiming the cell waste heat by means of a subcritical steam cycle yields a performance similar to that of a hybrid system. Similar results are obtained resorting to a closed helium <b>cycle.</b> Advanced <b>binary</b> <b>cycles,</b> using either potassium or cesium as working fluids, were extensively investigated in view of achieving a superior overall performance. The hot, clean stream exhausted by the fuel cell is recognized as an ideal heat source for a binary plant. The SOFC-binary cycle system was fully optimized yielding top efficiencies ∼ 74 per cent and an additional power output of ∼ 45 per cent of the cell rating (30 per cent {{in the case of the}} hybrid system). The excellent efficiency of a <b>binary</b> <b>cycle</b> combined with the large amount of oxygen that is available in the cell exhaust flow suggests that a supplementary firing of the fuel could improve the overall merit of the system. Burning 75 per cent of the additional natural gas, for example, reduces the total efficiency to a level of that of a hybrid system but makes available an extra power 1. 35 times greater than the fuel cell capacity. Pushing further this concept, the fuel cell could become an auxiliary equipment of a <b>binary</b> <b>cycle...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} current and {{prospective}} power plant concepts were investigated to evaluate their potential {{to serve as the}} basis of the next generation geothermal power plant (NGGPP). The NGGPP has been envisaged as a power plant that would be more cost competitive (than current geothermal power plants) with fossil fuel power plants, would efficiently use resources and mitigate the risk of reservoir under-performance, and minimize or eliminate emission of pollutants and consumption of surface and ground water. Power plant concepts were analyzed using resource characteristics at ten different geothermal sites located in the western United States. Concepts were developed into viable power plant processes, capital costs were estimated and levelized busbar costs determined. Thus, the study results should be considered as useful indicators of the commercial viability of the various power plants concepts that were investigated. Broadly, the different power plant concepts that were analyzed in this study fall into the following categories: commercial binary and flash plants, advanced binary plants, advanced flash plants, flash/binary hybrid plants, and fossil/geothed hybrid plants. Commercial binary plants were evaluated using commercial isobutane as a working fluid; both air-cooling and water-cooling were considered. Advanced <b>binary</b> concepts included <b>cycles</b> using synchronous turbine-generators, cycles with metastable expansion, and cycles utilizing mixtures as working fluids. Dual flash steam plants were used as the model for the commercial flash cycle. The following advanced flash concepts were examined: dual flash with rotary separator turbine, dual flash with steam reheater, dual flash with hot water turbine, and subatmospheric flash. Both dual flash and <b>binary</b> <b>cycles</b> were combined with other cycles to develop a number of hybrid cycles: dual flash <b>binary</b> bottoming <b>cycle,</b> dual flash backpressure turbine <b>binary</b> <b>cycle,</b> dual flash gas turbine <b>cycle,</b> and <b>binary</b> gas turbine <b>cycle.</b> Results {{of this study indicate that}} dual flash type plants are preferred at resources with temperatures above 400 F. Closed <b>loop</b> (<b>binary</b> type) plants are preferred at resources with temperatures below 400 F. A rotary separator turbine upstream of a dual flash plant can be beneficial at Salton Sea, the hottest resource, or at high temperature resources where there is a significant variance in wellhead pressures from well to well. Full scale demonstration is required to verify cost and performance. Hot water turbines that recover energy from the spent brine in a dual flash cycle improve that cycle's brine efficiency. Prototype field tests of this technology have established its technical feasibility. If natural gas prices remain low, a combustion turbine/binary hybrid is an economic option for the lowest temperature sites. The use of mixed fluids appear to be an attractive low risk option. The synchronous turbine option as prepared by Barber-Nichols is attractive but requires a pilot test to prove cost and performance. Dual flash <b>binary</b> bottoming <b>cycles</b> appear promising provided that scaling of the brine/working fluid exchangers is controllable. Metastable expansion, reheater, Subatmospheric flash, dual flash backpressure turbine, and hot dry rock concepts do not seem to offer any cost advantage over the baseline technologies. If implemented, the next generation geothermal power plant concept may improve brine utilization but is unlikely to reduce the cost of power generation by much more than 10 %. Colder resources will benefit more from the development of a next generation geothermal power plant than will hotter resources. All values presented in this study for plant cost and for busbar cost of power are relative numbers intended to allow an objective and meaningful comparison of technologies. The goal of this study is to assess various technologies on an common basis and, secondarily, to give an approximate idea of the current costs of the technologies at actual resource sites. Absolute costs at a given site will be determined by the specifics of a given project...|$|R
