500|$|American {{football}} {{also plays}} a significant role in American culture. The Super Bowl is considered a de facto national holiday, and in parts of the country like Texas, the sport has been compared to a religion. Football is also linked to other holidays; New Year's Day is traditionally the date for several college football bowl games, including the Rose Bowl. However, if New Year's Day is on a Sunday, the bowl games are moved to another date to not conflict with the typical NFL Sunday schedule. Thanksgiving football is an American tradition, hosting many high school, college, and professional games. Steve Deace of USA Today wrote that Americans are passionate about football [...] "because it embodies everything we love about American exceptionalism. Merit is rewarded, not punished. Masculinity is celebrated, not feminized. People of various beliefs and backgrounds – a melting pot, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> – must unify for a common goal for the team to be successful". Implicit rules such as playing through pain and sacrificing for the better of the team are promoted in football culture.|$|E

[...] The original script featured various flashback sequences to the actors Peter Donat, William B. Davis and Veronica Cartwright, all from scenes around twenty-to-thirty years earlier in the show. They did various makeup jobs on the actors to make them look younger. However, the writers eventually {{came to the conclusion that}} it [...] "just didn't [...] work", so they cut out most of that storyline, which ultimately led to the creation of a whole new direction in which the Cigarette Smoking Man provided a monologue explaining the history of the project instead. The first scene was shot in Long Beach, California.|$|E
500|$|Paolini {{chose to}} have Eragon mature {{throughout}} the book because, [...] "for one thing, it's one of the archetypal fantasy elements". He thought Eragon's growth and maturation {{throughout the book}} [...] "sort of mirrored my own growing abilities {{as a writer and}} as a person, too. So it was a very personal choice for that book." [...] Eragon's dragon, Saphira, was imagined as [...] "the perfect friend" [...] by Paolini. He decided to go in a more [...] "human direction" [...] with her because she is raised away from her own species, in [...] "close mental contact" [...] with a human. [...] "I considered making the dragon more dragon-like, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>will,</b> in its own society, but I haven't had a chance to explore that. I went with a more human element with Saphira while still trying to get a bit of the magic, the alien, of her race." [...] Paolini made Saphira the [...] "best friend anyone could have: loyal, funny, brave, intelligent, and noble. She transcended that, however, and became her own person, fiercely independent and proud." [...] Saphira's blue tinted vision was in turn inspired by Paolini's own color-blindness.|$|E

So, on the 30th, Washington appealed to his men to stay one month longer for a bounty of ten dollars. He asked any men who wanted to volunteer to poise their firelocks, but not a man turned out. Washington then wheeled his horse around and rode in front of the troops, saying [...] "My brave fellows, you have done all I asked you to do, and more than could be reasonably expected; but your country is at stake, your wives, your houses and all that you hold dear. You have worn yourselves out with fatigues and hardships, but we know not how to spare you. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> consent to stay only one month longer, you will render that service to the cause of liberty and to your country which you probably never can do under any other circumstances."

500|$|Critic {{and writer}} Kim Newman {{described}} Vampyrs style as {{closer to the}} experimental features such as Un chien andalou than a [...] "quickie horror film" [...] made {{after the release of}} Dracula (1931). Dreyer originally was going to film Vampyr in what he described as a [...] "heavy style" [...] but changed direction after cinematographer Maté showed him one shot that came out fuzzy and blurred. This washed out look was an effect Dreyer desired, and he had Maté shoot the film through a piece of gauze held threefeet (.9m) away from the camera to re-create this look. For other visuals in the film, Dreyer found inspiration from the fine arts. Actress Rena Mandel, who plays Gisèle, said that Dreyer showed her reproductions of paintings of Francisco Goya during filming. In Denmark, a journalist and friend of Dreyer, Henry Hellsen wrote in detail about the film and the artworks it appeared to draw on. When being asked about the intention of the film at the Berlin premiere, Dreyer replied that he [...] "had not any particular intention. I just wanted to make a film different from all other films. I wanted, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>will,</b> to break new ground for the cinema. That is all. And do you think this intention has succeeded? Yes, I have broken new ground". The filming of Vampyr was completed the middle of 1931.|$|E
500|$|Reckitt and Colman {{approached}} Stanley Wagner to buy Coldcrops, {{and after}} a very long negotiation a deal was concluded. A letter from Barclays Bank dated 21 June 1956 reads [...] " [...] Dear Mr Wagner, I have pleasure in enclosing two copies of the Draft for £......... credited to your account, which the Bank will be pleased <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> accept as a souvenir of this most successful transaction". The deal transferred ownership of the packaging and concept from Coldcrops to Reckitt & Coleman, and the new Jif-brand lemon juice was launched in 1956. All parties were delighted, Stanley Wagner with a substantial sum of money, for those days and a large profit from the six million lemons that had been sold, Reckitt's even more so because the negotiating team had permission to pay far more for the business than {{they were able to}} achieve. Lemon farmers in Sicily were also pleased, because the demand had increased for Sicilian lemon juice, which was largely a by-product of Sicilian lemon oil production. For many years, whilst producing lemon oil, Sicilians had found little use for the juice. Now there was a rapidly growing market for their near-waste product. In 1970, Jif continued to be prepared with lemon juice from Sicily. Later on, Unilever acquired the Jif brand in 1995 for the price of £250m, when it purchased Colman's of Norwich.|$|E
500|$|Team of Rivals was {{generally}} well received by critics. Pulitzer Prize-winning Civil War historian James M. McPherson called it [...] "an elegant, incisive study of Lincoln and leading {{members of his}} cabinet that will appeal to experts {{as well as to}} those whose knowledge of Lincoln is an amalgam of high school history and popular mythology" [...] and stated that Goodwin addressed Lincoln's gift for coalition-building [...] "better than any other writer". Allen C. Guelzo wrote in The Washington Post that [...] "this immense, finely boned book is no dull administrative or bureaucratic history; rather, it is a story of personalities – a messianic drama, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> – in which Lincoln must increase and the others must decrease." [...] In the Seattle Times, Kimberly Marlowe Hartnett praised the book's [...] "ambitious, multi-strand structure", concluding, [...] "This monumental effort is a gift; Goodwin's work clarifies and preserves Lincoln's legacy with rare skill." [...] Randy Dotinga of the Christian Science Monitor called Team of Rivals an [...] "immense and immensely readable work". Sanford D. Horwitt of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that Goodwin is [...] "an engaging, insightful chronicler of Lincoln's Civil War presidency, although she strays from time to time from her stated intention of keeping the lens focused on Lincoln and his 1860 rivals, who, in turn, were often feuding with others in Lincoln's Cabinet." ...|$|E
