40|$|Background: Hyperbilirubinemia {{can damage}} the brain of infants. The {{neurological}} outcome of these children is not clear, {{there could be some}} mild motor abnormalities. <b>General</b> <b>movements</b> are a reliable method to assess the neurological function of an infant. Aim: Assessing the quality of <b>general</b> <b>movements</b> of children with hyperbilirubinemia and compare them with the quality of <b>general</b> <b>movements</b> of children without a hyperbilirubinemia. Methods: The quality of the <b>general</b> <b>movements</b> was assessed, using Prechtl’s method. The <b>general</b> <b>movements</b> were assessed three times for the infants in the studygroup and one time for the infants in the control group. The quality of the <b>general</b> <b>movements</b> were related to several factors. Results: There is a trend towards more abnormal <b>general</b> <b>movements</b> in the study group compared to the control group (92 % vs 60 %, p= 0, 135), the optimality score was lower in the study group (14, 8 vs 12, p< 0, 05). The postnatal age at which the hyperbilirubinemia was diagnosed, seemed to relate to the optimality score. By follow-up of the infants in the study group, the <b>general</b> <b>movements</b> and the optimality score improved. Conclusions: Infants with a hyperbilirubinemia showed a trend towards more abnormal <b>general</b> <b>movements</b> and had a lower optimality score compared to children without a hyperbilirubinemia. The <b>general</b> <b>movements</b> improved during the treatment. The abnormal <b>general</b> <b>movements</b> shows us that the nervous system is not functioning optimal during hyperbilirubinemia, a prediction about the future neurological situation can not be given. ...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} in term infants {{associations between}} quality of <b>general</b> <b>movements</b> and developmental outcome in term infants at 6 years with either cerebral palsy (CP) or limited mobility without CP. METHOD: Participants of this prospective study were 145 term infants (86 male, 59 female). Their <b>general</b> <b>movements</b> quality was assessed at 'writhing' and 'fidgety' <b>general</b> <b>movements</b> age (3 wks and 13 wks post term). The assessment at 6 years {{consisted of a}} neurological examination, including assessment of minor neurological dysfunction (MND), evaluation of mobility with the Movement Assessment Battery for Children, and of behaviour and learning problems with questionnaires. RESULTS: Definitely abnormal <b>general</b> <b>movements</b> at writhing age were not associated with CP, whereas definitely abnormal <b>general</b> <b>movements</b> at fidgety age were (sensitivity 60 %; specificity 91 %; positive predictive value 19 %, negative predictive value 98 %). In children without CP, <b>general</b> <b>movements</b> quality {{was not associated with}} limited mobility, but it was associated to a minor extent with MND. INTERPRETATION: In term infants, definitely abnormal <b>general</b> <b>movements</b> at fidgety age do predict CP, but with lower accuracy than in preterm infants. <b>General</b> <b>movements</b> quality does not predict limited mobility in children without CP. The study supports suggestions that predictive value of <b>general</b> <b>movements</b> assessment in term infants is lower than that in preterm infants...|$|R
40|$|Assessment of {{the quality}} of <b>general</b> <b>movements</b> in preterm infants by means of 1 -h video {{recordings}} is a sensitive method for investigating the integrity of the central nervous system. In two preterm infants, who were followed weekly until term, an abnormal quality of <b>general</b> <b>movements</b> was found, presumably due to systemic disease (bacterial and fungal infections). Both children were neurologically normal at the age of 6 (case A) and 12 months (case B) corrected age. In contrast to abnormal <b>general</b> <b>movements</b> due to a brain lesion, the abnormal quality of <b>general</b> <b>movements</b> in systemic disease is not consistently observable, not even during the 1 h of video recording. The presence, in otherwise abnormal <b>general</b> <b>movements,</b> of remaining rotations, superimposed on flexion and extension of the limbs, appears to be a reliable indication for a favourable outcome. Another abnormality seen in one of the infants was a severe {{reduction in the number of}} <b>general</b> <b>movements,</b> but with a normal quality in the remaining few <b>general</b> <b>movements.</b> This indicates that a reduction in quantity of <b>general</b> <b>movements</b> is prognostically not a bad sign, at least not if the quality of the remaining movements is normal. Although the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms remain unclear, these findings are important in clinical practice. It means that it is possible to discriminate between abnormal <b>general</b> <b>movements</b> due to a cerebral lesion, and abnormal <b>general</b> <b>movements</b> due to systemic disease (infection), provided that the observation period is sufficiently long and a longitudinal developmental trajectory is obtained...|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{occupation}} of Pabu, and the <b>general</b> <b>movement</b> of Australian forces towards Wareo–Bonga, the Japanese infantry were threatened with being trapped. In response, the Japanese commander, Katagiri, diverted some of the effort away from the recapture of Finschhafen, and resolved to recapture the North Hill–Pabu area. A strong force of Japanese subsequently advanced south along the coastal track from Bonga, attempting to retake North Hill and the ground north of the Song River. Commencing on 22 November, the Japanese made heavy assaults around North Hill, on positions which were defended by Australians from the 2/43rd Infantry Battalion and the 2/2nd Machine Gun Battalion. The 2/32nd, with two companies isolated to the north around Pabu, was also {{in the thick of the}} fighting, and over the space of 10 days it was subjected to repeated attacks. Despite being short of food and receiving repeated mortar fire, the 2/32nd held its ground with the assistance of strong artillery support, and in doing so inflicted heavy casualties upon the Japanese. Later at least 195 bodies were found around the 2/32nd's position; their own losses amounted to 25 killed and 51 wounded. The Japanese commanding general, Hatazo Adachi, later pinpointed the Australian capture of Pabu Hill as one of the main reasons for the defeat of his force during the Huon Peninsula campaign.|$|E

40|$|In 17 fetuses with {{intrauterine growth}} {{retardation}} (IUGR), we studied {{the quantity of}} <b>general</b> <b>movements</b> and fetal breathing movements both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. In IUGR fetuses, cross-sectional comparisons were made between the quantity of fetal movements and (1) the fetal clinical condition and (2) the quality of <b>general</b> <b>movements.</b> In addition, the quantity of fetal movements in IUGR was compared with that in uncomplicated pregnancies and in pregnancies complicated by premature rupture of the amniotic membranes. In IUGR, the quantity of <b>general</b> <b>movements</b> declined from 25 weeks gestation onwards, whereas the quantity of fetal breathing movements increased. Longitudinal assessment of these parameters was obtained in four cases and showed a decline of <b>general</b> <b>movements.</b> No relationship between prenatal longitudinal data and neonatal outcome could be observed. Relating the quantity of <b>general</b> <b>movements</b> and breathing movements to the fetal condition, growth retarded fetuses were divided into three groups according to fetal deterioration. 1.

The quantity of <b>general</b> <b>movements</b> {{as well as that}} of breathing movements was low in group 3, compared to group 1. In group 2 only the quantity of breathing movements and not of <b>general</b> <b>movements</b> was low. A similar pattern was found in the relation with the quality of <b>general</b> <b>movements</b> observed during fetal deterioration. Cross-sectional analysis of median values (28 - 31 weeks gestation) did not reveal differences in the quantity of <b>general</b> <b>movements</b> when IUGR, normal pregnancies and premature rupture of the membranes (with or without oligohydramnios) were compared. The quantity of fetal breathing movements was significantly lower in pregnancies complicated by IUGR and by premature rupture of the membranes with oligohydramnios compared to those of normal pregnancies and premature rupture of the membranes without oligohydramnios. In uncomplicated IUGR, the quantity of <b>general</b> <b>movements</b> and breathing movements is in the same range as in normal uncomplicated pregnancies.

While the method's sensitivity is similar in all age groups studied (preterm, term, first month, second month, and third month age epochs), and averages 94. 5 %, the specificity of the method is age-dependent.

25|$|In the Banggai cardinalfish, {{courtship}} {{behavior is}} usually {{initiated by the}} female. Upon choosing a mate, the female isolates her potential mate from other individuals in the colony by creating a spherical spawning site that is about 50-60 centimeters in diameter. The <b>general</b> <b>movement</b> that the female exhibits is called ‘side by side trembling,’ {{which is where the}} female approaches the male from behind with a vigorous trembling motion while the male stays motionless. Then she places herself alongside him and tilts her body thirty degrees outward from its vertical plane, when the male and female’s caudal and anal fins come into contact. The female repeats this movement until the male responds with sporadic ‘mouth opening,’ a sign of receptiveness. Such courtship behavior may last from several hours to two to three days. When an intruder interrupts a female’s courtship behavior, the female would rapidly and aggressively chase the intruder away if the intruder is of the same sex. However, when the secondary male, or the intruder male approaches, he, instead of the female, exhibits trembling behavior, and also helps to defend the female and primary male’s isolated territory. If the primary male does not respond to female’s trembling, the female leaves periodically to visit the secondary male and displays trembling behavior which often results in mating.|$|E
