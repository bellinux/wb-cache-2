25|$|A modern HDD records data by {{magnetizing}} a {{thin film}} of <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>material</b> on a disk. Sequential changes {{in the direction of}} magnetization represent binary data bits. The data is read from the disk by detecting the transitions in magnetization. User data is encoded using an encoding scheme, such as run-length limited encoding, which determines how the data is represented by the magnetic transitions.|$|E
25|$|A {{magnetic}} field contains energy, and physical systems move toward configurations with lower energy. When diamagnetic material {{is placed in}} a {{magnetic field}}, a magnetic dipole tends to align itself in opposed polarity to that field, thereby lowering the net field strength. When <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>material</b> is placed within a magnetic field, the magnetic dipoles align to the applied field, thus expanding the domain walls of the magnetic domains.|$|E
40|$|It {{is shown}} that {{two-dimensional}} periodic magnetic systems with in-plane magnetization composed by {{a mixture of}} <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>materials</b> have an effective diamagnetic behavior. Because {{of the formation of}} effective “surface magnetic charges” resulting from the magnetization contrast at the boundary between the two <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>materials,</b> the demagnetizing field is parallel to the in-plane external magnetic field in some regions of the unit cell. Some examples of real systems exhibiting this behavior are given.

25|$|The {{magnetic}} {{moments of}} atoms in a <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>material</b> {{cause them to}} behave something like tiny permanent magnets. They stick together and align themselves into small regions of more or less uniform alignment called magnetic domains or Weiss domains. Magnetic domains can be observed with a magnetic force microscope to reveal magnetic domain boundaries that resemble white lines in the sketch. There are many scientific experiments that can physically show magnetic fields.|$|E
25|$|Continuous phase {{transitions}}, such as order-disorder {{transitions in}} metallic alloys and ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transitions, involve {{a transition from}} an ordered to a disordered state. In terms of correlation functions, the equal-time correlation function is non-zero for all lattice points below the critical temperature, and is non-negligible for only a fairly small radius above the critical temperature. As the phase transition is continuous, the length over which the microscopic variables are correlated, , must transition continuously from being infinite to finite when the material is heated through its critical temperature. This {{gives rise to a}} power-law dependence of the correlation function as a function of distance at the critical point. This is shown in the figure in the left for the case of a <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>material,</b> with the quantitative details listed in the section on magnetism.|$|E

2500|$|When {{magnetized}} strongly {{enough that}} the prevailing domain overruns all others to result in only one single domain, the material is magnetically saturated. [...] When a magnetized <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>material</b> is heated to the Curie point temperature, the molecules are agitated {{to the point that}} the magnetic domains lose the organization, and the magnetic properties they cause cease.

2500|$|Although this {{magnetic}} flux distribution seems somewhat counter-intuitive to {{those familiar with}} simple bar magnets or solenoids, {{the reason for this}} flux distribution can be intuitively visualised using Mallinson's original diagram (note this uses the negative y-component, unlike the diagram in Mallinson's paper). The diagram shows the field from a strip of <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>material</b> with alternating magnetization in the y direction (top left) and in the x direction (top right).

50|$|Most importantly, {{magnetic}} circuits are nonlinear; {{the reluctance}} in a magnetic circuit is not constant, as resistance is, but {{varies depending on}} the magnetic field. At high magnetic fluxes the <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>materials</b> used for the cores of magnetic circuits saturate, limiting further increase of the magnetic flux through, so above this level the reluctance increases rapidly. In addition, <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>materials</b> suffer from hysteresis so the flux in them depends {{not just on the}} instantaneous MMF but also on the history of MMF.
