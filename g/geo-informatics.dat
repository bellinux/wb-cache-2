40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{dependency}} of the GPS positioning precision on station location in an idealized positioning environment. Using a weighting function {{to account for}} an averaged number of satellites at different latitudes, we demonstrate that GPS positioning precision for ambiguity fixed solutions reduces when the latitude increases. We also quantify that the positioning precision in the north-south direction is worse than that in the east-west direction at all latitudes using the same approach.

40|$|The area {{measurement}} value {{is used in}} almost every discipline. As the development of Remote Sensing, images are widely used for land parcel {{area measurement}}s. However, measurements from remote sensing images can induce large errors, which usually are not considered by users. In this research, experiments are designed to study area measurement errors influenced by parcel shapes, orientations and scales. It {{is the first time}} to clearly quantify the orientation in this issue. Department of Land Surveying and <b>Geo-Informatic...</b>|$|R
