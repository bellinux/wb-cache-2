In a 2003 interview on The O'Reilly Factor, Savage {{has said that}} although he is a liberal Jewish and believes in God, he attends houses of worship {{only once or twice}} a year. In his 2012 book Trickle Down Tyranny, Savage wrote: [...] "...I'm not religious. <b>Do</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> in God? Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't." ...|$|E
500|$|The Spaniel Club {{was formed}} in 1885, and issued a breed {{standard}} for the Norfolk Spaniel, recognising it as a variety of spaniel. However, the general public saw it only as a generic land spaniel. By the 1890s, the breed had become common throughout the counties of England, leading dog writers such as Rawdon Briggs Lee to question the authenticity of its origins, or that the various liver and white spaniels from around England constituted a single breed; [...] "Personally, I do not consider the liver and white spaniel any particular variety at all, nor <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that {{it has ever been}} indigenous to Norfolk." [...] He states that similar dogs exist in Devonshire that do not trace ancestry to Norfolk, and that liver and white spaniels pre-date the breeding of the Black and Tan Terrier with an ordinary spaniel. F.H.F. Mercer described the breed in 1890 as being [...] "virtually extinct in its purity", with its liver and white colours running through any numbers of miscellaneous spaniels, and he too discredits the origins involving the Duke of Norfolk.|$|E

2500|$|He {{had many}} {{things about him}} which served to allure men to the {{gratification}} of their passions; he had also many things which acted as incentives to industry and toil. The vices of lust raged in him; {{but at the same}} time he was conspicuous for great energy and military skill. Nor <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that there ever existed so strange a prodigy upon the earth, made up in such a manner of the most various, and different and inconsistent studies and desires.-Cicero, Pro Caelio (...) ...|$|E
2500|$|On January 10, 2007, Bush {{announced}} {{the commitment of}} more than 20,000 additional troops {{as a part of}} the Iraqi troop surge of 2007. McCain was a leading advocate for the move, leading some Democrats to call the policy the [...] "McCain Doctrine". Days after the announcement, McCain appeared on CBS' Face the Nation and said, [...] "This is a chance under the new leadership of General Petraeus and Admiral Fallon to have a chance to succeed. <b>Do</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> it can succeed? Yes, I do." [...] On February 4, he criticised a bipartisan non-binding resolution opposing the troop buildup, calling it a [...] "vote of no confidence" [...] in the US military. The next day, McCain said, [...] "I don't think it's appropriate to say that you disapprove of a mission and you don't want to fund it and you don't want it to go, but yet you don't take the action necessary to prevent it".|$|E
2500|$|In mid-2009, Epic {{ended their}} {{contract}} with Norwood following {{the appointment of}} Amanda Ghost, making Human her only album with the label. A Los Angeles Times article later revealed Norwood's discontent {{with the success of}} the project the following year when asked about the commercial failure of Human: [...] "It was lacking my belief in it. It lacked my vision. Pretty much bottom line, if you don't believe in something it's not going to go," [...] she said. [...] "So <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that Human was as creative as Never Say Never and Full Moon? No, I do not. You definitely want to put something out that's like that. I felt at the same time I could have had much better songs and a much better set-up." [...] A statement she made during a 2010 interview with Out magazine turned out more harsh: [...] "To hell with that album! [...] Where I felt creatively it could've gone and the space I was in creatively, I needed everybody around me to be in that same space. It would've been a different album, but with the same inspiration and same blessing for other people. It would've been hotter music and a hotter look." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bachmann {{brought up}} the {{interview}} before business leaders and Republicans during a campaign stop in St. Cloud, Minnesota, on October 21, 2008. She stated that she never intended to question Obama's patriotism. [...] "I made a misstatement. I said a comment that I would take back. I did not, nor do I, question Barack Obama's patriotism... I {{did not say that}} Barack Obama is anti-American nor <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that Barack Obama is anti-American... I'm very concerned about Barack Obama's views. I don't believe that socialism is a good thing for America." [...] However, in March 2010, Bachmann said, [...] "I said I had very serious concerns that Barack Obama had anti-American views—and now I look like Nostradamus" [...] while speaking at a fund-raiser for the Susan B. Anthony List. A year later, in March 2011, Bachmann was asked on Meet the Press if she still believed that Obama held un-American views. She responded [...] "I believe that the actions of this government have, have been emblematic of ones that have not been based on true American values." [...] Pressed for clarification, she said [...] "I've already answered that question before. I said I had very serious concerns about the president's views." ...|$|E
