40|$|A simple method, for {{extraction}} of 9 organophosphate pesticides from {{human whole blood}} and urine, using the headspace solid-phase microextraction (SPME) method is presented. After heating a vial containing the samples and the pesticides (IBP, methyl parathion, fenitrothion, malathion, fenthion, <b>isoxathion,</b> ethion, EPN and phosalone) at 100 °C, a polydimethylsiloxane-coated SPME fiber was exposed to the headspace of the vial to allow adsorption of the pesticides before a capillary gas chromatography (GC) with nitrogenphosphorus detection. The headspace SPME-GC for whole blood and urine gave peaks for each pesticides. Recoveries of the 8 pesticides were 11 - 0. 3 % for whole blood; those of the 9 pesticides were 40 - 3. 8 % for urine. The detection limits of each pesticide were 2. 2 - 100 ng/ 0. 5 ml for whole blood and 0. 8 - 12 ng/ 0. 5 ml for urine. Reproducibility for headspace SPME-GC data were excellent for both body fluids. rights:日本法中毒学会rights:本文データは日本法中毒学会の許諾のもと掲載しています...|$|E
40|$|In Taiwan, the {{vegetable}}-fruit markets produce much waste, i. e., vegetable residue. For {{the time}} being, {{it has not}} completely reused. In fact, this waste contains amount of inorganic nutrients and organic materials and should be appropriately renewable and recycling. It's a good method {{to reduce the amount}} of crop wastes or produce compost and organic fertilizer. In this research, we collected vegetable wastes from market, to carry out the pesticides selection and ferment digest test. We used multiresidue method to detect the amount of the pesticides residue. In the process of digestion, detect the amount of pesticides and recovery test, we also measured temperature, pH and EC. In order to understand the decay property of vegetable wastes residual pesticides in the storage process and the change of the property and nutrient, also detected organic C, total N and the amount of Ca, Mg, K, Na, and S after digestion. The result of the pesticides residue abundance in summer vegetable wastes from C-market show that the amount of Chlorpyrifos (O,O -diethyl - 3, 5, 6 -trichloro- 2 -pyridyl phosphorothioate) is 3. 3 μg g- 1, SD is about ± 10 %, IDL is 0. 01 μg g- 1 [...] The result of the pesticides residue abundance in winter vegetable wastes from C-market show that the amount of Chlorpyrifos is 0. 18 μg g- 1, Monocrotophos (dimethyl(E) - 1 -methyl - 2 -(methylcarbamoyl) vinyl phosphate) is 0. 25 μg g- 1, Methamidophos (O,S - dimethyl phosphoramidothioate) is 0. 11 μg g- 1, Acephate (O,S- dimethyl acetylphosphoramidothioate) is 0. 07 μg g- 1, <b>Isoxathion</b> (O,O- diethyl O- 5 -phenylisoxazol- 3 -yl phosphorothioate) is 0. 41 μg g- 1, SD is about ± 5 % to ± 15 %. The result of the pesticides residue abundance in winter vegetablwastes from K-market show that the amount of Chlorpyrifos is 0. 3 μg g- 1, Monocrotophos is 0. 41 μg g- 1, Methamidophos is 0. 04 μg g- 1, Profenofos is 0. 17 μg g- 1 [...] The amount of the pesticides residue in the process of leaf digest and recovery test, show that the recovery of select pesticides are between 80 % to 120 %, SD is ± 1 % to ± 15 %. The degradation of Chlorpyrifos in the process of digestion during summer is fast between 21 to 27 days. But the rate of degradation became slow after 27 days. The degradation of Chlorpyrifos, Methamidophos and <b>Isoxathion</b> in the process of digestion during winter is fast because hydrolysis result in digestion between 7 to 21 days. The degradation became slower after 21 days. The pesticides residue time become longer, maybe result from the temperature during winter is colder than summer. The degradation of Monocrotophos was fast, it couldn't be detect after 21 days. The degradation of Chlorpyrifos is fast in the process of digestion during winter between 0 to 7 days, The degradation became slower after 7 days. The residual time of Methamidophos and Profenofos became more longer. The temperature in the process of fermention was no significant change, pH value after fermention was approach 7. From this research, there are no organochloride pesticides residue such as DDT in the vegetable wastes. Although the vegetable wastes residue organophosphate pesticides, such as Chlorpyrifos, Methamidophos and Profenofos. But they will degradation in the process of fermention. Therefore, after fermention, those vegetable wastes can produce liquid fertilizer or as the organic materials. 本省各地果菜集貨市場所產生相當多之作物廢棄物-蔬菜殘葉，目前均未加以充分利用。其實，這些作物廢棄物含有相當量之養分與有機質，應妥善加以資源化及循環利用。將作物廢棄物製成堆肥及有機質肥料，再施用於農田是極為可行之方式。 本研究收集果菜市場內蔬菜殘葉，進行藥劑之篩選及發酵分解試驗。以多重農藥殘留分析方法檢測農藥殘留，並於蔬菜殘葉分解過程進行農藥之檢測及回收率試驗。同時測定蔬菜殘葉分解過程之溫度、pH值與導電度，以及各分解階段殘葉有機碳、全氮量與殘葉分解後之Ca、Mg、K、Na、S含量。以瞭解蔬菜殘葉在貯置分解過程中殘留農藥之消退特性，以及蔬菜殘葉在分解過程中性質與營養狀態變化之情形與製成液態肥料之可能性。 2000 年夏季篩選C市場蔬菜殘葉中農藥殘留之結果顯示檢出陶斯松 (O,O -diethyl - 3, 5, 6 -trichloro- 2 -pyridyl phosphorothioate）為 3. 3 μg g- 1 ，標準偏差 ± 10 ﹪，儀器之偵測極限為 0. 01 μg g- 1 。冬季收集C市場之蔬菜殘葉，篩選殘葉中農藥殘留結果檢出陶斯松 0. 18 μg g- 1 、亞素靈 （dimethyl（E）- 1 -methyl - 2 -(methylcarbamoyl) vinyl phosphate） 0. 25 μg g- 1 、達馬松 (O,S - dimethyl phosphoramidothioate) 0. 11 μg g- 1 、歐殺松 (O,S- dimethyl acetylphosphoramidothioate) 0. 07 μg g- 1 、加福松 (O,O- diethyl O-phenylisoxazol- 3 -yl phosphorothioate) 0. 41 μg g- 1 。標準偏差大約在 ± 5 ﹪至 15 ﹪。冬季收集K市場之蔬菜殘葉，檢出陶斯松 0. 3 μg g- 1 、亞素靈 0. 41 μg g- 1 、達馬松 0. 04 μg g- 1 、佈飛松 (O- 4 -bromo- 2 -chlorophenyl O-ethyl S-propyl phosphorothioate) 0. 17 μg g- 1 。蔬菜殘葉分解過程進行檢測及回收率試驗，回收大多在 80 ﹪至 120 ﹪之間，標準偏差約在 ± 1 ﹪至 ± 15 ﹪。夏季蔬菜殘葉分解過程陶斯松消退之變化，在 21 至 27 天之間，降解非常快速，在 27 天之後則消退變緩。冬季C市場蔬菜殘葉分解過程農藥之消退，陶斯松、達馬松、加福松在 7 至 21 天之間因水解而降解快速，在 21 天之後則消退變緩，農藥殘留時間變長，是由於冬季溫度較夏季低。亞素靈之降解快速，在 21 天之後則偵測不到。冬季K市場蔬菜殘葉發酵分解過程農藥之消退，陶斯松在 0 至 7 天之間，消退快速，在 7 天之後則消退變緩，達馬松、佈飛松殘留之時間變長，因冬季溫度較夏季低。蔬菜殘葉發酵分解過程溫度無顯著之變化，pH於發酵分解後則接近於 7 。蔬菜殘葉藥劑之篩選及發酵分解試驗可知：農藥之殘留種類並無不易分解之如有機氯類之劇毒農藥。雖含有機磷劑類之禁用農藥如亞素靈，但可在蔬菜殘葉發酵 21 天後消退分解，陶斯松、達馬松、佈飛松等殘留，亦可在蔬菜殘葉發酵分解過程中消退。因此，在蔬菜殘葉發酵分解後，可作為液態肥料或作為堆肥之原料材質使用。目 錄 謝誌 [...] -i 中文摘要 [...] -ii 英文摘要 [...] -iv 目錄 [...] vi 表次 [...] -viii 圖次 [...] ix 前言 [...] - 1 前人研究 [...] 2 目的 [...] - 4 材料與方法 [...] - 14 一、 篩選檢測蔬菜殘葉中農藥殘留種類與含量 [...] - 20 二、 篩選出之農藥殘留種類進行回收率之試驗 [...] - 26 三、 農藥在冬夏兩季蔬菜殘葉發酵分解中之消退情形 [...] - 28 四、蔬菜殘葉發酵分解後殘留農藥與腐植質之關係探討 [...] - 28 五、蔬菜殘葉發酵分解過程中性質與營養狀態之變化情形 [...] - 30 結果與討論 [...] 33 一、 蔬菜殘葉樣品之來源及蔬菜之種類 [...] - 33 二、 檢測蔬菜殘葉樣品中農藥殘留種類與含量 [...] - 33 三、 篩選出之農藥殘留種類中回收率之變化情形 [...] - 38 四、農藥在冬夏兩季蔬菜殘葉發酵分解中之消退特性及分解情形 [...] - 42 （一）農藥在蔬菜殘葉發酵分解過程中之消退特性 [...] 42 （二）農藥在冬夏兩季蔬菜殘葉發酵分解過程中之分解情形 [...] 45 五、蔬菜殘葉發酵分解後殘留農藥與腐植質之關係探討 [...] - 47 六、蔬菜殘葉進行發酵分解過程性質與養分狀態之變化 [...] - 53 結論 [...] - 60 參考文獻 [...] 61 附錄 [...] - 6...|$|E
