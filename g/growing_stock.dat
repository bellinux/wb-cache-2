40|$|Multispecies {{fisheries}} management {{is the first}} step towards ecosystem-based {{fisheries management}}. Multispecies management accounts for a number of species and their physical, biological, and economic interactions. These interactions increase complexity in understanding stock dynamics and optimal catch. To address the issue of identifying optimal catch of stochastically <b>growing</b> multi <b>stocks,</b> we have formulated and applied a time-continuous stochastic model. The model, applied in prey-predator ecosystem, contributes to sustainable yet optimal management of multispecies marine fisheries. The findings suggest that the optimal catch for stochastically <b>growing</b> <b>stocks</b> in a multispecies interaction ecosystem is different from the deterministic catch...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} was to {{establish}} the structure of <b>growing</b> <b>stocks,</b> current volume increment, (commercial) value of <b>growing</b> <b>stocks</b> and current (commercial) value increment by different social collectives in highquality beech stands. In order to do so, beech stands from 18 site units were analysed, with analyses of five plots measuring 30 x 30 m carried out on each site unit. For all trees above the measurement threshold, the stem analyses were performed. The stem quality was estimated by quarters. On this basis, the volume, current decade volume increment, value and current decade value increment of stands were established. More than 90 % of volume and even aslightly higher share of value go to the trees from the stand canopy. The collective of 100 the thickest trees per hectare covers {{about half of the}} stands volume or stands value. The percentage of sliced veneer quality is extremely low (3 %), while the percentage of peeled veneer quality is five times higher. The highest values are achieved by stands from mountainous beech sites...|$|R

This implies an ecosystem management that includes a number of species and their physical, biological and economic interactions.

To {{address the issue of}} identifying optimal catch of stochastically <b>growing</b> multi <b>stocks,</b> we have formulated and applied a time-continuous stochastic model.

25|$|Comprehensive {{silvicultural}} programmes {{had made}} it possible for the Finns simultaneously to increase forest output and to add to the amount and value of the <b>growing</b> <b>stock.</b> By the mid-1980s, Finland's forests produced nearly 70 million cubic meters of new wood each year, considerably more than was being cut. During the postwar period, the annual cut increased by about 120 percent to about 50 million cubic meters. Wood burning fell to one-fifth the level of the immediate postwar years, freeing up wood supplies for the wood-processing industries, which consumed between 40 million and 45 million cubic meters per year. Indeed, industry demand was so great that Finland needed to import 5 million to 6 million cubic meters of wood each year.|$|E

25|$|Forest {{products}} {{have always been}} a staple to the economy, comprising 1% of the total gross state output and 9% of total manufacturing as of 2013. In 2007 Windham County contained the largest concentration of kilns for drying lumber east of the Mississippi River. The decline of farms has resulted in a regrowth of Vermont's forests due to ecological succession. Today, most of Vermont's forests are secondary. The state and non-profit organizations are actively encouraging regrowth and careful forest management. Over 78% of the land area of the state is forested compared to only 37% forest in 1880s when sheep farming was at its peak and large amounts of acreage were cleared for grazing land. Over 85% of that area is non-industrial, private forestland owned by individuals or families. In 2013 73.054 million cubic feet of wood was harvested in Vermont. A large amount of Vermont forest products are exports with 21.504 million feet being shipped overseas plus an additional 16.384 million cubic feet to Canada. Most of it was processed within the state. In this century the manufacture of wood products has fallen by almost half. The annual net growth has been estimated at 172.810 million cubic feet. The USDA estimates that 8.584 billion cubic feet remain in the state. Forest products also add to carbon sequestration since lumber and timber used in houses and furniture hold carbon {{for long periods of time}} while the trees that were removed are replaced overtime with new <b>growing</b> <b>stock.</b> While wood pellets are replacing coal in European power plants reducing CO2 emissions by up to 90% and preventing mountaintop removal for coal mining.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{many parts}} of Europe, close-to-nature {{silviculture}} (CNS) has been widely advocated as being the best approach for managing forests to cope with future climate change. In this review, we identify and evaluate six principles for enhancing the adaptive capacity of European temperate forests in a changing climate: (1) increase tree species richness, (2) increase structural diversity, (3) maintain and increase genetic variation within tree species, (4) increase resistance of individual trees to biotic and abiotic stress, (5) replace high-risk stands and (6) keep average <b>growing</b> <b>stocks</b> low. We use these principles to examine how three CNS systems (single-tree selection, group selection and shelterwood) serve adaptation strategies. Many attributes of CNS can increase the adaptive capacity of European temperate forests to a changing climate. CNS promotes structural diversity and tree resistance to stressors, and <b>growing</b> <b>stocks</b> can be kept at low levels. However, some deficiencies exist {{in relation to the}} adaptation principles of increasing tree species richness, maintaining and increasing genetic variation, and replacing high-risk stands. To address these shortcomings, CNS should make increased use of a range of regeneration methods, in order to promote light-demanding tree species, non-native species and non-local provenances...|$|R
