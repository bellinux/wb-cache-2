25|$|An {{arbitration}} committee was duly {{set up by}} the Ministry of Health and Welfare on 25 April, but it took almost a year to <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>draft</b> compensation plan. A newspaper leak in March 1970 revealed that the committee would ask Chisso to pay only ¥2 million ($5,600) for dead patients and ¥140,000 to ¥200,000 ($390 to $560) per year to surviving patients. The arbitration group were dismayed by the sums on offer. They petitioned the committee, together with patients and supporters of the litigation group, for a fairer deal. The {{arbitration committee}} announced their compensation plan on 25 May in a disorderly session at the Ministry of Health and Welfare in Tokyo. Thirteen protesters were arrested. Instead of accepting the agreement as they had promised, the arbitration group asked for increases. The committee was forced to revise its plan and the patients waited inside the ministry building for two days while they did so. The final agreement was signed on 27 May. Payments for deaths ranged from ¥1.7 million to ¥4 million ($4,700 to $11,100), one-time payments from ¥1 million to ¥4.2 million ($2,760 to $11,660) and annual payments between ¥170,000 and ¥380,000 ($470 to $1,100) for surviving patients. On the day of the signing, the Minamata Citizens' Council held a protest outside the Minamata factory gates. One of the Chisso trade unions held an eight-hour strike in protest at the poor treatment of the arbitration group by their own company.|$|E

50|$|The Bahamas {{had begun}} {{participating}} in the regional cooperation and integration movement when it began attending the Heads of Government Conferences of the Commonwealth Caribbean in 1966. This practice continued even after the establishment of CARIFTA, of which The Bahamas was never a member, with The Bahamas being involved in educational cooperation and Committees established to deepen financial cooperation among CARIFTA states and the Bahamas and to transform CARIFTA into the Caribbean Community. In particular, The Bahamas was even included in a Committee of Attorneys-General tasked with examining the legal implications of forming the Caribbean Community and to <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>draft</b> Treaty for its formation. In April 1973, at the final meeting of the Commonwealth Caribbean Heads of Government before {{the establishment of the}} Caribbean Community, the Conference welcomed the upcoming independence of The Bahamas in July 1973 and looked forward to its participation in the Caribbean Community. In late 1974, the Bahamas (as well as Haiti and Suriname) indicated that it would like to join the Community. Bahamian involvement with the Caribbean Community and regional integration continued in the same form after independence and the establishment of CARICOM as had occurred since 1966, with The Bahamas attending the second meeting of the CARICOM Heads of Government Conference in 1975 and being involved in the setting up of a special Inter-Governmental Committee on university education. In fact, the original Treaty of Chaguaramas (In Chapter I, Article 2) provided for The Bahamas to automatically join the Caribbean Community and Common Market upon application, with the Bahamas being listed alongside the actual member states as being a state to which membership of the Community may be open to. The final Conference of the Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community and The Bahamas at which this informal participation by The Bahamas continued was November 1982 Conference in Jamaica. At the next Conference, The Bahamas was formally admitted {{as a member of the}} Community.|$|E

40|$|The {{title of}} the thesis: The Identification of Substances in Real Samples Using Portable Raman Spectrometer The {{portable}} Raman spectrometer Ahura First Defender is a device designated for identifying unrecognized solid and liquid substances. The aim of this diploma thesis was to test {{the efficiency of the}} portable Raman spectrometer First Defender and to <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>draft</b> of the methodology for its manipulation. The objects of the investigation were the accuracy of results and collection of findings coming out of measuring tests using the device mentioned above. The introduction part briefly describes problems of chemical monitoring within Fire Rescue Service of the Czech Republic. As a partly solution of the problems could be the use of the portable spectrometer First Defender. Further are described problems of sampling and possibilities of sample detection through means of chemical reconnaissance. As next, there is described the device itself including the principle of Raman effect that allows the device to identify unrecognized solid and liquid chemical substances. The practical part explains the procedure and the way of applied measuring tests when using the device. The results are summarized in charts and the percentage of successful performed tests analyzed in charts. Findings concerning the manipulation with the device, methods for sample modification and the influence of sample matrix on the identification of selected chemicals in observed samples are introduced in the discussion. Professional knowledge and experience were used to draw up guidelines for the identification of substances in real samples conceived as general informational source describing procedures, rules, and recommendations.
