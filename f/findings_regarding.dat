25|$|The work {{performed}} by clinical psychologists {{tends to be}} influenced by various therapeutic approaches, all of which involve a formal relationship between professional and client (usually an individual, couple, family, or small group). Typically, these approaches encourage new ways of thinking, feeling, or behaving. Four major theoretical perspectives are psychodynamic, cognitive behavioral, existential–humanistic, and systems or family therapy. There has been a growing movement to integrate the various therapeutic approaches, especially with an increased understanding of issues regarding culture, gender, spirituality, and sexual orientation. With the advent of more robust research <b>findings</b> <b>regarding</b> psychotherapy, there is evidence that most of the major therapies have equal effectiveness, with the key common element being a strong therapeutic alliance. Because of this, more training programs and psychologists are now adopting an eclectic therapeutic orientation.|$|E
25|$|Van Leeuwenhoek's work fully {{captured}} the attention of the Royal Society, and he began corresponding regularly with the society regarding his observations. At first he had been reluctant to publicize his <b>findings,</b> <b>regarding</b> himself as a businessman with little scientific, artistic, or writing background, but de Graaf urged him to be more confident in his work. By the time van Leeuwenhoek died in 1723, he had written some 190 letters to the Royal Society, detailing his findings {{in a wide variety of}} fields, centered on his work in microscopy. He only wrote letters in his own colloquial Dutch; he never published a proper scientific paper in Latin. He strongly preferred to work alone, distrusting the sincerity of those who offered their assistance. The letters were translated into Latin or English by Henry Oldenburg, who had learned Dutch for this very purpose. Despite the initial success of van Leeuwenhoek's relationship with the Royal Society, soon relations became severely strained. In 1676, his credibility was questioned when he sent the Royal Society a copy of his first observations of microscopic single-celled organisms. Previously, the existence of single-celled organisms was entirely unknown. Thus, even with his established reputation with the Royal Society as a reliable observer, his observations of microscopic life were initially met with some skepticism.|$|E
25|$|Obtaining precise {{number is}} {{difficult}} {{for a variety of}} reasons. One of the major reasons for the difference in statistical <b>findings</b> <b>regarding</b> homosexuality and bisexuality {{has to do with the}} nature of the research questions. Major research studies on sexual orientation are discussed. Most of the studies listed below rely on self-report data, which poses challenges to researchers inquiring into sensitive subject matter. More importantly, the studies tend to pose two sets of questions. One set examines self-report data of same-sex sexual experiences and attractions while the other set examines self-report data of personal identification as homosexual or bisexual. Fewer research subjects identify as homosexual or bisexual than report having had sexual experiences or attraction to a person of the same sex. Several studies of sexual orientation in countries provide comparative perspectives. Tables comparing several U.S. cities' population numbers are also included. However, since many individuals may fail to report outside the heterosexual norm or define their sexuality in their own unique terms, it is difficult to fully grasp the size of the LGBT population. The type of survey being used and the type of setting a subject is in while being surveyed may also affect the answer that the subject gives.|$|E

This highlights two critical features of organizational learning: the importance of artifacts and the habituated nature of many organizational routines.|$|R

50|$|However, an {{important}} <b>finding</b> <b>regarding</b> positive feedback is that positive feedback {{is important for}} adults, but not for children. In their analysis of the literature, Deci et al. (1999) found that while adults had their intrinsic motivation significantly enhanced by positive feedback, children showed no such difference. Positive feedback for children neither significantly increased nor decreased their intrinsic motivation. Despite this, perceived satisfaction with tasks was still positively impacted by positive feedback for both children and adults.|$|R
500|$|The book is {{intended}} to present an accessible account of scholarly <b>findings</b> <b>regarding</b> the New Testament's teachings {{on the subject of}} empire. Likening Jesus to an American political candidate, Jesus for President identifies Luke 4:18-19 as the commencement speech of Jesus' campaign, [...] "Jubilee" [...] as his campaign slogan, and the revival of ancient Jubilee economics as his platform. The book asserts that the countercultural themes in the ministry of Jesus, such as those of self-denial, are ignored by the church because the Church is more interested in conforming its members to the state than to the Kingdom of God. The book warns against the lures of political and financial power. While the book suggests that Christians should live counterculturally in accordance with Jesus' teachings, the authors do not prescribe how Christians should accomplish this task. Neither do they advocate restructuring the economic or political systems of the United States. The book promotes pacifism, criticizes the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and expounds liberation theology.|$|E
500|$|While one set {{of critics}} and bloggers used the UCLA study to dismiss the {{argument}} raised in Carr's essay, another set took {{a closer look at}} the conclusions that could be drawn from the study concerning the effects of Internet usage. Among the reflections concerning the possible interpretations of the UCLA study were whether greater breadth of brain activity while using the Internet in comparison with reading a book improved or impaired the quality of a reading session; and whether the decision-making and complex reasoning skills that are apparently involved in Internet search, according to the study, suggest a high quality of thought or simply the use of puzzle solving skills. Thomas Claburn, in InformationWeek, observed that the study's <b>findings</b> <b>regarding</b> the cognitive impact of regular Internet usage were inconclusive and stated that [...] "it will take time before it's clear whether we should mourn the old ways, celebrate the new, or learn to stop worrying and love the Net".|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, I {{explore how}} Norwegian Social Science {{textbooks}} present the EU, and how teachers teach about the EU in the Norwegian {{equivalent to the}} British Sixth Form (“videregående school”). I also study the pupils’ opinion about the teaching. The analysis {{is based on a}} textbook analysis of seven of the books in use right now in Norwegian videregående school, in addition to in-depth interviews with nine teachers and group interviews with 15 pupils. The most specific <b>finding</b> <b>regarding</b> the textbook analysis is that the books do not have enough text to cover the EU sufficiently. Actually, six of the seven books do not fulfil the learning objective regarding the EU satisfactory. In addition, the analysis shows that several of the textbooks present a sceptical view of the EU. The most consistent <b>finding</b> <b>regarding</b> the interviews is how little the pupils actually know and remember about the EU. It is likely to assume that the pupils know and remember so little, because there is so little teaching about the EU. Regardless of how the teachers teach, it seems that the amount of teaching is the problem. If the Government wishes the population to acquire greater knowledge about the EU, this research suggests the need for expanding the hours taught about the EU in school...|$|R
