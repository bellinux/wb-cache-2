5|$|A {{number of}} {{protective}} {{measures have been}} implemented, including site access restrictions, the collection and cold-storage of seed, and the treatment of plants with phosphite.

5|$|Due to {{the tree}} of heaven's weedy habit, landowners and other organisations often resort to various methods of control {{in order to keep}} its populations in check. For example, the city of Basel in Switzerland has an {{eradication}} program for the tree. It can be very difficult to eradicate, however. Means of eradication can be physical, thermal, managerial, biological or chemical. A combination of several of these can be most effective, though they must of course be compatible. All have some positive and negative aspects, but the most effective regimen is generally a mixture of chemical and physical control. It involves the application of <b>foliar</b> or basal herbicides in order to kill existing trees, while either hand pulling or mowing seedlings in order to prevent new growth.|$|E
5|$|The {{application}} of phosphite inhibits growth of P.cinnamomi in B.sessilis, {{but does not}} kill the pathogen. In one study, a <b>foliar</b> spray containing phosphite inhibited the growth of P.cinnamomi by over 90% in plants infected with B.sessilis two weeks after spraying, and by 66% in plants infected one year after spraying; yet most plants infected shortly before or after spraying were dead 100 days later, while nearly all plants infected seven months later spraying survived a further 100 days. Phosphite is not known to affect plant growth, but {{has been shown to}} reduce pollen fertility: one study recorded fertility reductions of up to 50%, and, in a separate experiment, fertility reductions that persisted for more than a year.|$|E
5|$|Banksia verticillata {{has been}} {{declared}} vulnerable under the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, and Rare under Western Australia's Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. A 1995 census yielded an estimated total population size of 4500 plants. Apart from dieback and aerial canker, frequency of bushfires and illegal picking have been cited as threats. Ongoing management includes monitoring of current populations, gathering more data on best response to fire, and restricting access to populations. Seed has been collected from many populations, but germination rates after ten years of storage are much lower than in Banksia brownii. Translocation is considered an option in the future, as is spraying with phosphite, particularly {{in the vicinity of}} Walpole. Used successfully on B.brownii but as yet untrialled with B.verticillata, phosphite boosts the resistance of both infected and uninfected plants, and also acts as a direct fungicide. Aerial spraying of phosphite boosts plant survival and slows the spread of infection, but must be carefully managed as studies have shown that <b>foliar</b> spraying of phosphite adversely affects root and shoot growth.|$|E

25|$|Plant Toxicity: Chloride (Cl−) and {{magnesium}} (Mg2+) are both essential nutrients important for normal plant growth.

25|$|Because {{magnesium}} is {{a mobile}} nutrient, magnesium chloride can be effectively {{used as a}} substitute for magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt) to help correct magnesium deficiency in plants via <b>foliar</b> feeding.

25|$|The genus Exserohilum {{comprises}} dematiaceous fungi {{commonly associated}} with <b>foliar</b> plant diseases and rarely with human and animal phaeohyphomycosis. Fungi of this genus are characterized {{by the presence of}} melanin in their cell walls, which is thought to contribute to their virulence. Many Exserohilum species are plant pathogens that affect a wide range of plant species, especially grasses Poaceae, causing distinct leaf spots and blights. However, S. rostrata has also been shown to survive in human as well as animal hosts, indicating pathogenic versatility. Though E. rostratum is a rare cause of infection in people, the species can cause a spectrum of diseases including allergic fungal sinusitis, skin and subcutaneous infections, invasive disease and occasionally keratomycosis an inflammation of the cornea. Invasive and skin infections caused by Exserohilum occur more frequently in those that are immunodeficient or have impaired immunity, these include infections in the sinuses, lungs, lining of the heart, and bone. Whereas, local trauma is a predisposing factor for skin and corneal infections. Meningitis and peripheral arthritides have also been reported pursuant to exposure to contaminated intrathecal drugs.|$|E

500|$|A few {{plants that}} could be {{considered}} protocarnivorous or paracarnivorous are those that once had carnivorous adaptations but appear to be evolving or have evolved away from a direct prey relationship with arthropods and rely on other sources for obtaining nutrients. One example of such a phenomenon is the pitfall trap of Nepenthes ampullaria, a tropical pitcher plant. Although it retains its ability to attract, capture, kill, and digest insect prey, this species has acquired adaptations that appear to favor digestion of leaf litter. It could potentially be referred to as a detritivore. Another tropical pitcher plant, Nepenthes lowii, is known to catch very few prey items compared to other Nepenthes. Preliminary observations suggest that this particular species may have moved away from a solely (or even primarily) carnivorous nature and be adapted to [...] "catching" [...] the droppings of birds feeding at its nectaries. A 2009 study found that mature N. lowii plants derived 57–100% of their <b>foliar</b> nitrogen from treeshrew droppings.|$|E
500|$|Another notable {{illuminated}} edition {{had been}} created in 1846 by Owen Jones in a legible blackletter script with one decorative initial per page.

2500|$|Nepenthes lowii {{has also}} formed a {{dependent}} relationship, but with vertebrates instead of insects. The pitchers of N.lowii provide a sugary exudate reward on the reflexed pitcher lid (operculum) and a perch for tree shrew species, {{which have been}} found eating the exudate and defecating into the pitcher. A 2009 study, which coined the term [...] "tree shrew lavatories", determined between 57 and 100% of the plant's <b>foliar</b> nitrogen uptake comes from the faeces of tree shrews. Another study showed the shape {{and size of the}} pitcher orifice of N.lowii exactly match the dimensions of a typical tree shrew (Tupaia montana).

2500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that all trap types are modifications of a similar basic structure—the hairy leaf. Hairy (or more specifically, stalked-glandular) leaves can catch and retain drops of rainwater, especially if shield-shaped or peltate, thus promoting bacteria growth. Insects land on the leaf, become mired by the surface tension of the water, and suffocate. Bacteria jumpstart decay, releasing from the corpse nutrients that the plant can absorb through its leaves. This <b>foliar</b> feeding can be observed in most non-carnivorous plants. Plants that were better at retaining insects or water therefore had a selective advantage. Rainwater can be retained by cupping the leaf, and pitfall traps may have evolved simply by selection pressure for the production of more deeply cupped leaves, followed by [...] "zipping up" [...] of the margins and subsequent loss of most of the hairs. Alternatively, insects can be retained by making the leaf stickier by the production of mucilage, leading to flypaper traps.|$|E
2500|$|In Macroneuropteris, each {{individual}} leaflet or pinnule {{of the compound}} frond were also notably large. In fact, the species [...] M. scheuchzeri's pinnules were the largest of any seed plant of the Carboniferous Period. Individual pinnules are typically lanceolate with a round base. They {{have been found to}} be as long as 12cm. These individual leaflets are often found fossilized by themselves separated from the frond. They have been inferred by some to be deciduous. In the famous Mazon Creek Fossil Beds of Illinois, these leaflets are one of the most commonly found plant fossils. The leaves have thick cuticles, sunken stomata, dense trichomes, and large hair-like structures. These <b>foliar</b> characteristics combined with the spiny stem structure where the leaflets drop, and the potential deciduous nature have led to many authors suggesting a xeromorphic tendency in the tree. Such adaptations may have allowed the genus to dominate the late Carboniferous landscape as other plants like Lepidodendrales steadily declined.|$|E
6000|$|There is {{one other}} {{interesting}} point which deserves notice. We have seen that some tendrils owe their origin to modified leaves, and others to modified flower-peduncles; so that some are <b>foliar</b> and others axial in their nature. It might therefore have been expected {{that they would have}} presented some difference in function. This is not the case. On the contrary, they present the most complete identity in their several characteristic powers. Tendrils of both kinds spontaneously revolve at about the same rate. Both, when touched, bend quickly to the touched side, and afterwards recover themselves and are able to act again. In both the sensitiveness is either confined to one side or extends all round the tendril. Both are either attracted or repelled by the light. The latter property is seen in the <b>foliar</b> tendrils of Bignonia capreolata and in the axial tendrils of Ampelopsis. The tips of the tendrils in these two plants become, after contact, enlarged into discs, which are at first adhesive by the secretion of some cement. Tendrils of both kinds, soon after grasping a support, contract spirally; they then increase greatly in thickness and strength. When we add to these several points of identity the fact that the petiole of Solanum jasminoides, after it has clasped a support, assumes one of the most characteristic features of the axis, namely, a closed ring of woody vessels, we can hardly avoid asking, whether the difference between <b>foliar</b> and axial organs can be of so fundamental a nature as is generally supposed? {46} ...|$|E
60|$|FUMARIACEAE.--Corydalis claviculata.--According to Mohl (p. 43), the {{extremities}} of the branched stem, {{as well as}} the leaves, are {{converted into}} tendrils. In the specimens examined by me all the tendrils were certainly <b>foliar,</b> and it is hardly credible that the same plant should produce tendrils of a widely different homological nature. Nevertheless, from this statement by Mohl, I have ranked this species amongst the tendril-bearers; if classed exclusively by its <b>foliar</b> tendrils, it would be doubtful whether it ought not to have been placed amongst the leaf-climbers, with its allies, Fumaria and Adlumia. A large majority of its so-called tendrils still bear leaflets, though excessively reduced in size; but some few of them may properly be designated as tendrils, for they are completely destitute of laminae or blades. Consequently, we here behold a plant in an actual state of transition from a leaf-climber to a tendril- bearer. Whilst the plant is rather young, only the outer leaves, but when full-grown all the leaves, have their extremities converted into more or less perfect tendrils. I have examined specimens from one locality alone, viz. Hampshire; and it is not improbable that plants growing under different conditions might have their leaves a little more or less changed into true tendrils.|$|E
60|$|COMPOSITAE.--Mutisia clematis.--The immense {{family of}} the Compositae is well known to include very few {{climbing}} plants.

Mutisia is the only genus in the family, as far as I can learn, which bears tendrils: it is therefore interesting to find that these, though rather less metamorphosed from their primordial <b>foliar</b> condition than are most other tendrils, yet display all the ordinary characteristic movements, both those that are spontaneous and those which are excited by contact.|$|E
60|$|If you {{ask that}} {{convenient}} fiction, the Man in the Street, {{what sort of}} plant a cactus is, he will probably tell you it is all leaf and no stem, {{and each of the}} leaves grows out of the last one. Whenever we set up the Man in the Street, however, you must have noticed we do it in order to knock him down again like a nine-pin next moment: and this particular instance is no exception to the rule; for the truth is that a cactus is practically all stem and no leaves, what looks like a leaf being really a branch sticking out at an angle. The true leaves, if there are any, are reduced to mere spines or prickles on the surface, while the branches, in the prickly-pear and many of the ornamental hot-house cactuses, are flattened out like a leaf to perform <b>foliar</b> functions. In most plants, to put it simply, the leaves are the mouths and stomachs of the organism; their thin and flattened blades are spread out horizontally in a wide expanse, covered with tiny throats and lips which suck in carbonic acid from the surrounding air, and disintegrate it in their own cells under the influence of sunlight. In the prickly pears, on the contrary, it is the flattened stem and branches which undertake this essential operation {{in the life of the}} plant--the sucking-in of carbon and giving-out of oxygen, which is to the vegetable exactly what the eating and digesting of food is to the animal organism. In their old age, however, the stems of the prickly pear display their true character by becoming woody in texture and losing their articulated leaf-like appearance.|$|E
6000|$|By {{comparing}} {{the structure of}} the leaves, their degree of complication, and their rudimentary parts in the six genera, we are led to infer that their common parent form partook of the characters of Drosophyllum, Roridula, and Byblis. The leaves of this ancient form were almost certainly linear, perhaps divided, and bore on their upper and lower surfaces glands which had the power of secreting and absorbing. Some of these glands were mounted on pedicels, and others were almost sessile; the latter secreting only when stimulated by the absorption of nitrogenous matter. In Byblis the glands consist of a single layer of cells, supported on a unicellular pedicel; in Roridula they have a more complex structure, and are supported on pedicels formed of several rows of cells; in Drosophyllum they further include spiral cells, and the pedicels include a bundle of spiral vessels. But in these three genera these organs do not possess any power of movement, {{and there is no reason}} to doubt that they are of the nature of hairs or trichomes. Although in innumerable instances <b>foliar</b> organs move when excited, no case is known of a trichome having such [page 359] power.* We are thus led to inquire how the so-called tentacles of Drosera, which are manifestly of the same general nature as the glandular hairs of the above three genera, could have acquired the power of moving. Many botanists maintain that these tentacles consist of prolongations of the leaf, because they include vascular tissue, but this can no longer be considered as a trustworthy distinction. The possession of the power of movement on excitement would have been safer evidence. But when we consider the vast number of the tentacles on both surfaces of the leaves of Drosophyllum, and on the upper surface of the leaves of Drosera, it seems scarcely possible that each tentacle could have aboriginally existed as a prolongation of the leaf. Roridula, perhaps, shows us how we may reconcile these difficulties with respect to the homological nature of the tentacles. The lateral divisions of the leaves of this plant terminate in long tentacles; and these include spiral vessels which extend for only a short distance up them, with no line of demarcation between what is plainly the prolongation of the leaf and the pedicel of a glandular hair. Therefore there would be nothing anomalous or unusual in the basal parts of these tentacles, which correspond with the marginal ones of Drosera, acquiring the power of movement; and we know that in Drosera it is only the lower part which becomes inflected. But in order to understand how in this latter genus not only the marginal but all the inner tentacles have become capable of movement, we must further assume, either that through the principle of correlated development this ...|$|E
6000|$|From the thallus of a sea-weed up to {{the leaf}} of a highly {{developed}} phænogam, we find, at all stages, a contrast between {{the inner and outer}} parts of these flattened masses of tissue. In the higher Algæ [...] "the outermost layers consist of smaller and firmer cells, while the inner cells are often very large, and sometimes extremely long;"[51] and in the leaves of trees the epidermal layer, besides differing in the sizes and shapes of its component cells from the parenchyma forming the inner substance of the leaf, is itself differentiated by having a continuous cuticle, and by having the outer walls of its cells unlike the inner walls.[52] Especially significant is the structure of such intermediate types as the Liverworts. Beyond the differentiation of the covering cells from the contained cells, and the contrast between upper surface and under surface, the frond of Marchantia polymorpha clearly shows us the direct effect of incident forces; and shows us, too, how it is involved with the effect of inherited proclivities. The frond grows from a flat disc-shaped gemma, the two sides of which are alike. Either side may fall uppermost; and then of the developing shoot, the side exposed to the light [...] "is under all circumstances the upper side which forms stomata, the dark side becomes the under side which produces root-hairs and leafy processes."[53] So that while we have undeniable proof that the contrasted influences of the medium on the two sides, initiate the differentiation, we have also proof that the completion of it is determined by the transmitted structure of the type; since it is impossible to ascribe the development of stomata to the direct action of air and light. On turning from <b>foliar</b> expansions, to stems and roots, facts of like meaning meet us. Speaking generally of epidermal tissue and inner tissue, Sachs remarks that [...] "the contrast of the two is the plainer the more the part of the plant concerned is exposed to air and light."[54] Elsewhere, in correspondence with this, it is said that in roots the cells of the epidermis, though distinguished by bearing hairs, [...] "are otherwise {{similar to those of the}} fundamental tissue" [...] which they clothe,[55] while the cuticular covering is relatively thin; whereas in stems the epidermis (often further differentiated) is composed of layers of cells which are smaller and thicker-walled: a stronger contrast of structure corresponding to a stronger contrast of conditions. By way of meeting the suggestion that these respective differences are wholly due to the natural selection of favourable variations, it will suffice if I draw attention to the unlikeness between imbedded roots and exposed roots. While in darkness, and surrounded by moist earth, the outermost protective coats, even of large roots, are comparatively thin; but when the accidents of growth entail permanent exposure to light and air, roots acquire coverings allied in character to the coverings of branches. That the action of the medium causes these and converse changes, cannot be doubted when we find, on the one hand, that [...] "roots can become directly transformed into leaf-bearing shoots," [...] and, on the other hand, that in some plants certain [...] "apparent roots are only underground shoots," [...] and that nevertheless [...] "they are similar to true roots in function and in the formation of tissue, but have no root-cap, and, when they come to the light above ground, continue to grow in the manner of ordinary leaf-shoots."[56] If, then, in highly developed plants inheriting pronounced structures, this differentiating influence of the medium is so marked, it must have been all-important at the outset while types were undetermined.|$|E
