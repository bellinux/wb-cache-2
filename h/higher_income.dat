40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the causal nexus between energy consumption and economic growth for 119 countries {{from all over the}} world having at-least 30 years of available data on candidate variables, including 30 <b>high</b> <b>income</b> OECD, 13 <b>high</b> <b>income</b> non-OECD, 65 middle income and 11 low income countries. The study employs Granger-causality in the frequency domain context for empirical analysis, which allows one to examine the causal nexus over different frequencies and thus provides relatively a better picture of the causal nexus between the candidate variables. In particular, we examine the temporary (short-run) as well as at permanent (long-run) causal nexus between energy consumption and economic growth. The empirical results suggest that 18 countries (including 5 <b>high</b> <b>income</b> OECD, 2 <b>high</b> <b>income</b> Non-OECD, 10 middle income and 1 low income) confirm the existence of feedback hypothesis, 25 countries (including 4 <b>high</b> <b>income</b> OECD, 3 <b>high</b> <b>income</b> non-OECD, 14 middle income and 4 low income) confirm growth hypothesis out of total 119 countries. Similarly, 40 countries (including 6 <b>high</b> <b>income</b> OECD, 6 <b>high</b> <b>income</b> non-OECD, 27 middle income and 1 low income) suggest conservation hypothesis, while, 36 countries (comprising of 15 <b>high</b> <b>income</b> OECD, 2 <b>high</b> <b>income</b> non-OECD, 14 middle income and 5 low income) hold neutrality hypothesis between energy consumption and economic growth out of 119 countries.

5|$|As more middle-class and {{affluent}} people {{fled the}} city to the relative quiet and open spaces of the suburbs, the urban centers deteriorated and lost population. At the same time that cities were experiencing a lower tax base due to the flight of <b>higher</b> <b>income</b> earners, pressures from The New Deal forced them to offer pensions and other benefits, increasing the average cost of benefits per employee by 1,629percent. This was in addition to hiring an average of 20percent more employees to serve the ever shrinking cities. More Americans were driving cars and fewer were using public transportation, and it was not practical to extend to the suburbs. At the same time, the number of surface roads exploded to serve the ever-increasing numbers of individually owned cars, further burdening city and country resources. During this time, the perception of using public transportation turned more negative. In what is arguably the most extreme example, Detroit, the fifth largest city in the United States in 1950 with 1,849,568 residents, had shrunk to 706,585 by 2010, a reduction of 62 percent.|$|E

5|$|Although Galileo seriously {{considered}} the priesthood {{as a young}} man, at his father's urging he instead enrolled at the University of Pisa for a medical degree. In 1581, when he was studying medicine, he noticed a swinging chandelier, which air currents shifted about to swing in larger and smaller arcs. To him, it seemed, by comparison with his heartbeat, that the chandelier took {{the same amount of}} time to swing back and forth, no matter how far it was swinging. When he returned home, he set up two pendulums of equal length and swung one with a large sweep and the other with a small sweep and found that they kept time together. It was not until the work of Christiaan Huygens, almost one hundred years later, that the tautochrone nature of a swinging pendulum was used to create an accurate timepiece. Up to this point, Galileo had deliberately been kept away from mathematics, since a physician earned a <b>higher</b> <b>income</b> than a mathematician. However, after accidentally attending a lecture on geometry, he talked his reluctant father into letting him study mathematics and natural philosophy instead of medicine. He created a thermoscope, a forerunner of the thermometer, and, in 1586, published a small book on the design of a hydrostatic balance he had invented (which first brought him to the attention of the scholarly world). Galileo also studied disegno, a term encompassing fine art, and, in 1588, obtained the position of instructor in the Accademia delle Arti del Disegno in Florence, teaching perspective and chiaroscuro. Being inspired by the artistic tradition of the city and the works of the Renaissance artists, Galileo acquired an aesthetic mentality. While a young teacher at the Accademia, he began a lifelong friendship with the Florentine painter Cigoli, who included Galileo's lunar observations in one of his paintings.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability to}} move from one income group into another (income mobility) is a means of {{measuring}} economic opportunity.

25|$|The {{impact of}} the FairTax on the {{distribution}} of the tax burden is a point of dispute. The plan's supporters argue that it would decrease tax burdens, broaden the tax base, be progressive, increase purchasing power, and tax wealth, while opponents argue that a national sales tax would be inherently regressive and would decrease tax burdens paid by high-income individuals. Sales taxes are normally considered regressive; however, the FairTax provides a rebate that supporters argue would create a progressive effective rate on consumption. Under the FairTax, a low-income family may spend $25,000 on goods and services consuming 100% of their income. A <b>higher</b> <b>income</b> family making $100,000 may spend $80,000 on goods and services and save $20,000. The <b>higher</b> <b>income</b> family is consuming only 80% of their income on taxable goods and services. According to economist William G. Gale, the percentage of income taxed is regressive (using a cross-section time frame). However, when presented with an estimated effective tax rate, the low-income family above would pay a tax rate of 0% on the 100% of consumption and the <b>higher</b> <b>income</b> family would pay a tax rate of 15% on the 80% of consumption. The effective tax rate is progressive on consumption. Using a larger time frame, the other 20% would be consumed and taxed {{at some point in the}} future.|$|E

40|$|MBA thesisThe {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to determine whether credit card rewards and other value added benefits {{have an impact on the}} lifetime duration and profitability of credit card holders in the <b>High</b> <b>Income</b> segment of the South African market. It is well known that companies across various industries implement loyalty initiatives with the aim of encouraging increased and repeated spend which falls under the realm of customer relationship management. Specifically in the financial services industry, loyalty rewards have almost become a standard issue within the credit card business and consumers have come to expect rewards on their credit card purchases (Ferguson & Hlavinka, 2007 a). The aim of the research was to determine if these loyalty initiatives had the intended impact in a segment of the market that makes up an exceptionally small proportion of the overall South African population i. e. the <b>high</b> <b>income</b> segment, defined in this research as individuals earning greater than one million rand per annum.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} how {{to measure}} changes in inequality in an economy with income growth. The discussion distinguishes three stylized kinds of economic growth: <b>high</b> <b>income</b> sector enrichment, low <b>income</b> sector enrichment, <b>high</b> <b>income</b> sector enlargement, in which the <b>high</b> <b>income</b> sector expands and absorbs persons from the low income sector. The two enrichment types pose no problem for assessing inequality change {{in the course of}} economic growth: for <b>high</b> <b>income</b> sector enrichment growth, inequality might reasonably be said to increase, whereas for low income sector enrichment, inequality might be said to decrease. These adjustments are non-controversial and non-problematical. Where problems arise is in the case of <b>high</b> <b>income</b> sector enlargement growth. In that case, the two alternative approaches have been shown in this paper to yield markedly results: The traditional inequality indices generate an inverted-U pattern of inequality. That is, inequality rises {{in the early stages of}} <b>high</b> <b>income</b> sector enlargement growth and falls thereafter. The new approach suggested here, based on axioms of gap inequality and numerical inequality, generates a U pattern of inequality. That is, inequality falls in the early stages of <b>high</b> <b>income</b> sector enlargement growth and rises thereafter. The discrepancy between the familiar indices and the alternative approach based on axioms of gap inequality and numerical inequality bears further scrutiny. Two courses of action are possible. One might try to axiomatize inequality in ways that generate an inverted-U pattern in <b>high</b> <b>income</b> sector enlargement growth, thereby rationalizing the continued use of the usual inequality indices with the inverted-U property. Alternatively, one might retain the axioms proposed here, embed them into a more formal structure, and construct a family of inequality indices consistent with them.
