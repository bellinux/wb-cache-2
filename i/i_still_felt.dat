500|$|In 1991, Drummond admitted: [...] "We didn't {{listen to}} 1987 What The Fuck's Going On {{for a long}} time, and when we did we were embarrassed by {{it because it was}} so badly recorded. But <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>felt</b> {{we were able to get}} a lot out of {{ourselves}} through it." ...|$|E
500|$|With a {{past as a}} musician, I {{remember}} sometimes {{feeling like}} the audience was against me while I was on stage [...] Even if that wasn't noticeable in any way, <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>felt</b> as if they all disliked me, or at least, misunderstood me, deep inside. That paranoia was kind of firmly rooted inside of me—the fear of being the wrong artist {{in front of the}} wrong audience. Thus, the idea for 'She's Madonna' deals with that.|$|E
2500|$|Bee Vang, as paraphrased by Jeff Baenen of the Associated Press, {{said that}} the film's {{portrayal}} of the Hmong is [...] "generally accurate." [...] Regarding the result, Vang said [...] "his film is not a documentary. We can't expect 101 percent correctness." [...] During the filming, Hmong cast members addressed what they believed to be cultural inaccuracies that were being introduced. Cedric Lee, a half-Hmong {{who worked as a}} production assistant and a cultural consultant, said that [...] "Some things were over-exaggerated for dramatic purposes. Whether it was our job or not, <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>felt</b> some responsibility to speak our mind and say something, but at the same time, the script was what it was. We didn’t make the final decision." [...] Vang said while many Hmong had objected to some elements, the producers selected the viewpoints of the cultural consultants which [...] "had the most amenable take on the matter and would lend credence to whatever Hollywood stereotypes the film wanted to convey." [...] Vang further said that [...] "this was a white production, that our presence as actors did not amount to control of our images." ...|$|E
60|$|He took my {{hand and}} kissed it. He was like himself again, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>still</b> more encouraged.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> sat quite <b>still.</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that Eve's {{eyes were}} {{watching}} me. I set my teeth for a moment; and I turned toward her, my cigarette case in my hand.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> stood <b>still</b> and <b>felt</b> {{the blind}} eyes {{wandering}} over me. I {{could not speak}} to him--I dared not speak to him; I would go and hide myself afresh.|$|R
60|$|So I did. I {{saw myself}} in the glass, in my mourning-dress, a faded, hollow-eyed vision. Yet I thought little of the wan spectacle. The blight, I believed, was chiefly external: <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>felt</b> life at life's sources.|$|E
60|$|Abbotsford, August 27.--To-day we journeyed {{through the}} hills and amongst the storms; the weather rather {{bullying}} than bad. We viewed the Grey Mare's Tail, and <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>felt</b> confident in crawling along the ghastly bank by which you approach the fall. I will certainly get some road of application to Mr. Hope Johnstone, to pray {{him to make the}} place accessible. We got home before half-past five, having travelled forty miles.|$|E
60|$|Jacky left me, a {{few minutes}} later, to visit the local garage. Without any clear idea {{as to what was}} best to be done, <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>felt</b> that I was {{justified}} in making a few inquiries as to the cause of Delora's presence in Newcastle with that particular companion. I went to the telephone, therefore, and rang up the County Hotel. I asked to speak to the manager, who came at once to the instrument.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now for Isidore," [...] I went on. <b>I</b> own <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>still</b> {{more curious}} to see him than his rival; but Ginevra was absorbed in the latter.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{is it safe}} to go {{on without}} a guide?" [...] I inquired dubiously. I hadn't felt very safe with Peter Crow, but <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>still</b> more unsafe without him.|$|R
6000|$|He spoke {{like a man}} in earnest--there was {{no denying}} that. <b>Still,</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> {{something}} stirring uneasily against him in my mind. [...] "Can't you give that other person a name?" [...] I said.|$|R
60|$|I quelled this hysterica passio {{by pushing}} a walk towards Kaeside and back again, but when I {{returned}} <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>felt</b> uncomfortable, {{and all the}} papers I wanted {{were out of the}} way, and all those I did not want seemed to place themselves under my fingers; my cash, according to the nature of riches in general, made to itself wings and fled, I verily believe from one hiding-place to another. To appease this insurrection of the papers, I gave up putting my things in order till to-morrow morning.|$|E
60|$|This {{was indeed}} true; for, {{notwithstanding}} that I had slept so soundly during that day, <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>felt</b> a strong disinclination to rouse myself to action, and an intense desire {{to lie down}} again. These feelings being shared by my companions, it was resolved {{to spend the night}} where we were, but we took good care to kindle no fire to betray us a second time. We roused Eve and Salamander to take some food, after which we all lay down, and, ere long, were again sound asleep.|$|E
60|$|She spoke very quietly. The faint, sad {{voice was}} fainter and sadder than ever. She kept her head bent over her writing-case, instead of turning it toward me as usual {{while we were}} talking. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>felt</b> the mysterious {{trembling}} which had oppressed me in the garden. Drawing a chair near the fire, I stirred the embers together, and tried to warm myself. Our positions in the room left some little distance between us. I could only see her sidewise, as she sat by {{the window in the}} sheltering darkness of the curtain which still remained drawn.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{a bit of}} it," [...] Terence said. [...] "But for you, I {{should be}} in prison now. If they had been ten times as many, and ten times as costly, <b>I</b> should <b>still</b> have <b>felt</b> your debtor, all my life.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Winter {{advanced}} {{and kissed her}} and Jake gave Jim his hand. [...] "For a time, {{it looked as if}} we were going to lose you, partner. <b>Still</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> you would come back to us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I am, miss," [...] she replied. [...] "I don't {{know what}} it is. I can't hold myself <b>still.</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> so {{yesterday}} at about this same time, miss. Don't be uneasy, I think I'm ill." ...|$|R
6000|$|Well, I took a {{drink and}} then I said to myself, I said, [...] "See here, I'm {{going to see this}} thing through." [...] So I turned back and walked {{straight}} upstairs again to my room. I fully expected something queer was going to happen and was prepared for it. But do you know when I walked into the room again the feeling, or presentiment, or whatever it was I had had, was absolutely gone. There was my book lying just where I had left it and the reading lamp still burning on the table, just as it had been, and my chair just where I had pushed it back. But I felt nothing, absolutely nothing. I sat and waited awhile, but <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>felt</b> nothing.|$|E
6000|$|... "My health had {{improved}} {{in my old}} home--but {{it was for a}} time only. I sank again, and the doctors ordered me to Europe. Avoiding England (why, you may guess), I took my passage, with you and your mother, for France. From France we passed into Italy. We lived here; we lived there. It was useless. Death had got met and Death followed me, go where I might. I bore it, for I had an alleviation to turn to which I had not deserved. You may shrink in horror from the very memory of me now. In those days, you comforted me. The only warmth <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>felt</b> at my heart was the warmth you brought to it. My last glimpses of happiness in this world were the glimpses given me by my infant son.|$|E
60|$|I had a spirit-lamp in my room, and I {{made myself}} rapidly {{a cup of}} strong tea. Even after I had drunk it, <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>felt</b> {{the remains of the}} drowsy feeling hanging around me. It was now ten minutes to eleven, and I opened my {{wardrobe}} to find the only weapon with which I proposed to arm myself,--a heavily loaded Malacca cane, which had more than once done me good service. To my surprise it was not in its accustomed corner. I was perfectly certain that I had seen it since my return from Paris, and I proceeded to make a thoroughly methodical search. I left scarcely an inch of space in my rooms undisturbed. At last I was forced to {{come to the conclusion that}} the stick had gone. Either the valet or some one else must have borrowed it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I didn't attach {{any great}} {{importance}} to it myself," [...] Nevitt went on, unconcerned. [...] "I thought most likely Cyril wouldn't be there. But <b>still</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> you'd like, at any rate, to know about it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Vincenzo Nibali of the [...] squad {{was shocked}} by the news of his fellow countryman Basso's cancer. He {{nonetheless}} talked about the upcoming race in those terms: [...] "I want to see if the real Nibali is around. More than anything, I want some answers for myself. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> haven’t <b>felt</b> as good as I did last year, I hope it happens starting from tomorrow (Tuesday). Will I attack? We’ll see.... If there’s a chance, why not?" ...|$|R
30|$|Xiao Xiong: Although they [parents] {{could not}} really help me, <b>still,</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> blessed {{when they said}} they would sell {{everything}} to support me. When I cried in bed at night, I would recall their encouragement. It gave me courage to keep it up [laughs].|$|R
60|$|I {{have not}} counted Mr. Woodcourt among our {{visitors}} {{because he was}} now Caddy's regular attendant. She soon began to improve under his care, {{but he was so}} gentle, so skilful, so unwearying in the pains he took that it is not to be wondered at, I am sure. I saw a good deal of Mr. Woodcourt during this time, though not so much as might be supposed, for knowing Caddy to be safe in his hands, I often slipped home at about the hours when he was expected. We frequently met, notwithstanding. I was quite reconciled to myself now, but <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>felt</b> glad to think that he was sorry for me, and he still WAS sorry for me I believed. He helped Mr. Badger in his professional engagements, which were numerous, and had as yet no settled projects for the future.|$|E
60|$|If {{there had}} been time, I should {{probably}} have ordered several suits of clothes for this occasion; but as there was not, I was fain to be content with those I had. My appetite vanished instantly, and I knew no peace or rest until the day arrived. Not that its arrival brought me either; for, then I was worse than ever, and began haunting the coach-office in Wood Street, Cheapside, before the coach had left the Blue Boar in our town. For all that I knew this perfectly well, <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>felt</b> {{as if it were}} not safe to let the coach-office be out of my sight longer than five minutes at a time; and in this condition of unreason I had performed the first half-hour of a watch of four or five hours, when Wemmick ran against me.|$|E
60|$|In {{a moment}} I found myself {{converted}} from a prisoner into a demi-god. I was escorted {{back through the}} town in triumph, the people pressing forward to touch my clothing and to gather up the dust on which my foot had trod. One of the largest huts was put at my disposal, and a banquet of every native delicacy was served me. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>felt,</b> however, that I was not a free man, as several spearmen were placed as a guard {{at the entrance of}} my hut. All day my mind was occupied with plans of escape, but none seemed in any way feasible. On the one side was the great arid desert stretching away to Timbuctoo, on the other was a sea untraversed by vessels. The more I pondered over the problem the more hopeless did it seem.|$|E
5000|$|... "I never started {{teaching}} because I thought 'hey, I'd like to teach!' It {{was just a}} way to make ends meet really. But that's where the opportunities opened up for me, so that's what <b>I</b> did. <b>Still,</b> <b>I</b> always <b>felt</b> I was a player first and a teacher second. In fact, writing instructional stuff still always feels like work to me.".|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{has been}} very nice indeed of you to see us, Mr. Coulson," [...] she said, [...] "especially after all these other people have been bothering you. Of course, I am sorry that you haven't {{anything}} more to tell us than we knew already. <b>Still,</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that I couldn't rest until we had been." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No;" [...] and the girl's {{voice was}} steady, though a trifle strained. [...] "At least, not always. <b>Still,</b> <b>I</b> have <b>felt</b> {{that some day}} I should have to choose whom I should hold to--my father or you. It {{is very hard to}} face that question, Jimmy." ...|$|R
60|$|But <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>felt</b> embarrassment with her. I {{felt myself}} {{dependent}} upon her for house room {{and food and}} social support, as it were under false pretences. I {{would have liked to}} have separated our financial affairs altogether. But I knew that to raise the issue would have seemed a last brutal indelicacy. So I tried almost furtively to keep my personal expenditure within the scope of the private income I made by writing, and we went out together in her motor brougham, dined and made appearances, met politely at breakfast--parted at night with a kiss upon her cheek. The locking of her door upon me, which at that time I quite understood, which I understand now, became for a time in my mind, through some obscure process of the soul, an offence. I never crossed the landing to her room again.|$|E
60|$|In {{a moment}} I found myself {{converted}} from a prisoner into a demi-god.

I little dreamed how near I was to its solution.|$|E
6000|$|I heartily {{agreed to}} this, and went without delay to the hospital, where, however, no new light was thrown on the subject. On the contrary, I found, what Slidder had {{neglected}} to ascertain, {{that the name}} of the girl in question was not Edie Willis, but Eva Bright, a circumstance which troubled me much, and inclined me to believe that we had got on a false scent; but when I reflected on the other circumstances of the case <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>felt</b> hopeful. The day of Edie's disappearance tallied exactly with the date of the robbing of the girl by Brassey and the Slogger. Her personal appearance, too, as described by the Slogger, corresponded exactly with the description given of her granddaughter by Mrs Willis; and, above all, the sending of a messenger from the hospital by the girl to inquire for her [...] "grandmother, Mrs Willis," [...] were proofs too strong to be set aside by the mystery of the name.|$|E
60|$|This was a {{delicate}} and difficult question to answer--at least, to {{my way of}} thinking. There was little prospect of keeping the poor old gentleman's sad secret. It was known to Fritz and Minna, {{as well as to}} Mr. Keller. <b>Still,</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> an unconquerable reluctance to be the first person who revealed the disaster that had befallen him.|$|R
5000|$|The episode {{garnered}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics, with many praising the opening sequence and ending. IGN's Matt Fowler, who gave a lukewarm {{review of the}} episode, said that though Beth's death was predictable, it [...] "felt like a big moment and it's always wrenching to see other characters react {{to the death of}} their loved ones. I liked Beth, but <b>I</b> <b>still</b> mostly <b>felt</b> bad about her death because Daryl and Maggie (who seemed to have to be reminded this week that Beth being gone at all was a topic she should care about) felt bad about it." [...] Fowler ultimately gave the episode a 7.6 out of 10.|$|R
60|$|Perhaps he was wishing {{the while}} that that piercing, pining voice of mine would keep silence, {{so that my}} {{presence}} might not disturb his own brooding thoughts. I could only guess at pleasing him. Yet <b>I</b> <b>felt,</b> <b>still</b> feel, that he was glad of my company and never for a moment sorry we had met.|$|R
