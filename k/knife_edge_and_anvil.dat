40|$|An {{experimental}} {{program was}} carried out to address {{issues related to the}} observed cracking of the titanium <b>knife</b> <b>edges</b> on the labyrinth seals of the high pressure fuel pump (HPFP) in the Space Shuttle main engine (SSME). Thermal shock experiments were carried out using a jet specimen with geometry similar to the <b>knife</b> <b>edge</b> geometry. These tests demonstrate that cracking of the titanium alloy is possible in a situation involving repeated thermal cycles over a wide temperature range, as might be realized during a rub in the liquid hydrogen fuel pump. High speed rub interaction tests were conducted using a representative <b>knife</b> <b>edge</b> <b>and</b> seal geometry over a broad range of interaction rates. Alternative materials were also experimentally evaluated. These tests provide information which can be used to design improved labyrinth seals for the HPFP of the SSME. In particular, plasma-sprayed aluminum-graphite was found to be significantly better than aluminum alloy seals used at present from the standpoint of rub performance.

40|$|The {{results of}} a {{theoretical}} and experimental investigation to determine the critical compression load for a universal testing machine are presented for specimens loaded through <b>knife</b> <b>edges.</b> The critical load for the testing machine is the load at {{which one of the}} loading heads becomes laterally instable in relation to the other. For very short specimens the critical load was found to be less than the rated capacity given by the manufacturer for the machine. A load-length diagram is proposed for defining the safe limits of the test region for the machine. Although this report is particularly concerned with a universal testing machine of a certain type, the basic theory which led to the derivation of the general equation for the critical load, P (sub cr) = alpha L can be applied to any testing machine operated in compression where the specimen is loaded through <b>knife</b> <b>edges.</b> In this equation, L is the length of the specimen between <b>knife</b> <b>edges</b> <b>and</b> alpha is the force necessary to displace {{the upper end of the}} specimen unit horizontal distance relative to the lower end of the specimen in a direction normal to the <b>knife</b> <b>edges</b> through which the specimen is loaded...|$|R

40|$|Imaging with {{structured}} illumination {{allows for}} the retrieval of subwavelength features of an object by conversion of evanescent waves into propagating waves. In conditions in which the object plane and the structured-illumination plane do not coincide, this conversion process is subject to progressive filtering of the components with high spatial frequency when {{the distance between the}} two planes increases, until the diffraction-limited lateral resolution is restored when the distance exceeds the extension of evanescent waves. We study the progressive filtering of evanescent waves by developing a remote super-resolution terahertz imaging system operating at a wavelength Î» = 1. 00 mm, based on a freestanding <b>knife</b> <b>edge</b> <b>and</b> a reflective confocal terahertz microscope. In the images recorded with increasing knife-edge-to-object-plane distance, we observe the transition from a super-resolution of Î»/ 17 = 60 Î¼m to the diffraction-limited lateral resolution of Îx=Î» expected for our confocal microscope. The extreme nonparaxial conditions are analyzed in detail, exploiting the fact that, in the terahertz frequency range, the <b>knife</b> <b>edge</b> can be positioned at a variable subwavelength distance from the object plane.

The device was used in tests of several potential abradable materials, ranging from porous to fully dense. It was shown that the rub energy dissipated in initial and subsequent passes is a fundamental parameter {{in the evaluation of}} material abradability. Rub energy was found to be influenced by such factors as: density and tensile (or yield) strength of the abradable material, prior densification or work hardening of the rub surface, and the sharpness of {{the leading edge of the}} blade tip...|$|R
40|$|Cryo-electron {{microscopy}} of vitreous sections (CEMOVIS) {{has recently}} been shown to provide images of biological specimens with unprecedented quality and resolution. Cutting the sections remains however the major difficulty. Here, we examine the parameters influencing {{the quality of the}} sections and analyse the resulting artefacts. They are in particular: knife marks, compression, crevasses, and chatter. We propose a model taking into account the interplay between viscous flow and fracture. We confirm that crevasses are formed on only one side of the section, and define conditions by which they can be avoided. Chatter is an effect of irregular compression due to friction of the section of the <b>knife</b> <b>edge</b> <b>and</b> conditions to prevent this are also explored. In absence of crevasses and chatter, the bulk of the section is compressed approximately homogeneously. Within this approximation, it is possible to correct for compression by a simple linear transformation for the bulk of the section.

50|$|The {{smaller the}} angle between the blade and stone, the sharper the knife will be, but the less side force {{is needed to}} bend the edge over or chip it off. The angle between the blade and the stone is the edge angle - the angle from the {{vertical}} {{to one of the}} <b>knife</b> <b>edges,</b> <b>and</b> equals the angle at which the blade is held. The total angle {{from one side to the}} other is called the included angle - on a symmetric double-ground edge (a wedge shape), the angle from one edge to the other is thus twice the edge angle. Typical edge angles are about 20Â° (making the included angle 40Â° on a double-ground edge). The edge angle for very sharp knives can be as little as 10 degrees (for a 20Â° included angle). Knives that require a tough edge (such as those that chop) may sharpen at 25Â° or more.|$|R

A restraint system may be used to simulate conditions found in a complete vehicle. Quantifying the quality of the restraint with only point-measurement devices can leave an inadequate characterization of the out-of-plane behavior. However, today s full-field displacement monitoring techniques allow for much more accurate views of the global panel deformation and strain, and therefore allow for a better understanding of panel behavior. In the current study, the behavior of a hat-stiffened and two rod-stiffened carbon-epoxy panels is considered. Panels were approximately 2 meters tall and 0. 76 to 1. 06 m wide. Unloaded edges were supported by <b>knife</b> <b>edges</b> <b>and</b> stiffeners were attached to a support structure at selected locations to restrain out-of-plane motion.

50|$|Grinding is {{generally}} done with {{some type of}} sharpening stone. Sharpening stones come in coarse and fine grits and {{can be described as}} hard or soft based on whether the grit comes free of the stone with use. Many sources of naturally occurring stones exist around the world; some types known to the ancient world are no longer used, due to exhaustion of former resources or the ready availability of superior alternatives. Arkansas, USA is one source for honing stones, which are traditionally used with water or honing oil. India is another traditional source for stones. Ceramic hones are also common, especially for fine grit size. Japanese water stones (both artificial and natural) come in very fine grits. Before use, they are soaked in water, then flushed with water occasionally to expose new stone material to the knife blade. The mixture of water and abraded stone and knife material is known as slurry, which can assist with the polishing of the <b>knife</b> <b>edge</b> <b>and</b> help sharpen the blade.

Over 84, 000 pieces of debris were recovered; hundreds were subsequently subjected to NDT and materials analysis. Visual NDT of the debris revealed localized areas of damage such as erosion, excessive heating, <b>knife</b> <b>edging</b> <b>and</b> mechanical damage.

Texture mapping provided a means to capture true colors of the debris and superimpose them on the scanned images. Uniform deposits were found over large portions of debris, obscuring underlying materials. To determine what was beneath, inverse radiography was enlisted. The radiographs guided investigators to where samples should be taken. To ascertain compositions, these samples were subjected to analytical testing, including energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and electron microprobe analysis.
