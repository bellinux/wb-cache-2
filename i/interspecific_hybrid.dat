40|$|Species of {{the genus}} Daphnia, in {{particular}} the subgenus Hyalodaphnia, represent a taxonomically problematic group due to their phenotypic plasticity, local races {{and the formation of}} <b>interspecific</b> <b>hybrids</b> and backcrosses. In this study, we present a genetic approach utilising nuclear DNA to unequivocally identify species and <b>interspecific</b> <b>hybrids.</b> Several nuclear loci (ITS 1 -ITS 2, CA 14 and GA 13) were amplified by PCR and products were subjected to diagnostic restriction enzymes (restriction fragment length polymorphism; RFLP). The application of this approach to several populations across Europe revealed that the markers are highly consistent and reproducible. In addition, we illustrate with a number of examples how this approach contributed to unravel previously unrecognised taxa, increased the sensitivity of biodiversity studies or contributed to the analysis of resting egg banks. Advantages and disadvantages of this approach compared to existing techniques are discussed and several empirical studies and their results are summarised.

40|$|Reproductive {{characterization}} of <b>interspecific</b> <b>hybrids</b> among Capsicum species Carlos Eduardo da Silva Monteiro 1, Telma Nair Santana Pereira 1 * and Karina Pereira de Campos 1 * ABSTRACT – The {{objective of this}} study was the reproductive {{characterization of}} Capsicum accessions as well as of <b>interspecific</b> <b>hybrids,</b> based on pollen viability. Hybrids were obtained between Capsicum species. Pollen viability was high in most accessions, indicating that meiosis is normal, resulting in viable pollen grains. The pollen viability of species C. pubescens was the lowest (27 %). The <b>interspecific</b> <b>hybrids</b> had varying degrees of pollen viability, from fertile combinations (C. chinense x C. frutescens and C. annuum x C. baccatum) to male sterile combinations. Pollen viability also varied within the hybrid combination according to accessions used in the cross. Results indicate that male sterility is one of the incompatibility barriers among Capsicum species since hybrids can be established, but may be male sterile.
