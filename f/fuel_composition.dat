5|$|A {{flexible-fuel vehicle}} (FFV) or dual-fuel vehicle (colloquially called a flex-fuel vehicle) is an {{alternative}} fuel vehicle with an internal combustion engine designed to run {{on more than one}} fuel, usually gasoline blended with either ethanol or methanol fuel, and both fuels are stored in the same common tank. Modern flex-fuel engines are capable of burning any proportion of the resulting blend in the combustion chamber as fuel injection and spark timing are adjusted automatically according to the actual blend detected by a <b>fuel</b> <b>composition</b> sensor.

2500|$|A 2011 study {{conducted}} by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland found practically no difference in fuel consumption in normal driving conditions between commercial gasoline grades 95E10 and 98E5 sold in Finland, despite the public perception that fuel consumption is significantly higher with 95E10. VTT performed the comparison test under controlled laboratory conditions and their measurements showed the cars tested used an average of [...] of 95E10 per , as opposed to [...] of 98E5 per [...] The difference was 0.07 in favor of 98E5 on average, meaning that using 95E10 gasoline, which has a higher ethanol content, increases consumption by 0.7%.

40|$|A {{new model}} {{incorporating}} two combustion modes {{was developed to}} simulate dualfuel(DF) combustion engines with different <b>fuel</b> <b>compositions</b> (natural gas/diesel oil andmethanol/dimethyl ether (DME)). The model involved two coupled combustion modes: a"conventional" partially premixed reactor diesel mode and a flame propagation mode. For the flame propagation combustion mode, an expression for the reaction rate wasdeduced based on the equation for the flame speed. Laminar flame speeds for theaspirated fuels were calculated using the PREMIX code within the Chemkin- 2 packageby using the chemical mechanisms for the <b>fuel</b> <b>compositions</b> and species moleculartransport properties and were subsequently fitted to polynomial expressions. Theturbulent flame speed was assumed {{to depend on the}} laminar speed and characteristics offlow turbulence. CFD partial and full cycle engine simulations were performed for two heavy dutydiesel engines, a Volvo D 12 C and an IF (Isotta Fraschini), using the 3 D CFD KIVA 3 Vand KIVA 4 codes supplemented by similar spray models and semi-detailed combustionand emission formation mechanisms for both <b>fuel</b> <b>compositions.</b> The natural gas fuel wasselected as a four-component mixture of methane (> 90 %), ethane, propane and n-butane,while diesel oil vapor was represented as a blend of n-heptane and toluene.

50|$|The {{formation}} of soot depends strongly on the <b>fuel</b> <b>composition.</b> The rank ordering of sooting tendency of fuel components is: naphthalenes → benzenes → aliphatics. However, {{the order of}} sooting tendencies of the aliphatics (alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes) varies dramatically depending on the flame type. The difference between the sooting tendencies of aliphatics and aromatics is thought to result mainly from the different routes of formation. Aliphatics appear to first form acetylene and polyacetylenes, which is a slow process; aromatics can form soot both by this route and also by a more direct pathway involving ring condensation or polymerization reactions building on the existing aromatic structure.|$|E

The CH* chemiluminescence distribution in CH 4 –air and CH 4 –H 2 –air flames and the OH* chemiluminescence distribution in H 2 –air flames are {{recorded in the}} experiments. Cell-like flames are observed for the CH 4 –air mixture for all tested equivalence ratios. However, for CH 4 –H 2 –air and H 2 –air flames, ball-like lean limit flames are observed.

The experimentally observed lean limit flames are predicted qualitatively by numerical simulation with the mixture-averaged transport model and skeletal mechanism of CH 4. The results of the simulations show that the entire lean limit flames of CH 4 –H 2 –air and H 2 –air mixtures are located inside a recirculation zone. However, for the lean limit CH 4 –air flame, only the leading edge is located inside the recirculation zone. A flame structure with negative flame displacement speed is observed for the leading edges of the predicted lean limit flames with all three different <b>fuel</b> <b>compositions.</b> As compared with 1 D planar flames, the fuel transport caused by convection is less significant in the present 2 D lean limit flames for the three different <b>fuel</b> <b>compositions.</b> For the trailing edges of the three predicted lean limit flames, a diffusion dominated flame structure is observed...|$|R
