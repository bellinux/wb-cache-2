5|$|This {{measure of}} {{elasticity}} is {{sometimes referred to}} as the own-price <b>elasticity</b> <b>of</b> demand for a good, i.e., the <b>elasticity</b> <b>of</b> demand with respect to the good's own price, in order to distinguish it from the <b>elasticity</b> <b>of</b> demand for that good with respect to the change in the price of some other good, i.e., a complementary or substitute good. The latter type of elasticity measure is called a cross-price <b>elasticity</b> <b>of</b> demand.|$|E
5|$|Breadth of {{definition}} of a good: The broader the {{definition of a}} good (or service), the lower the elasticity. For example, Company X's fish and chips would tend to have a relatively high <b>elasticity</b> <b>of</b> demand if a significant number of substitutes are available, whereas food in general would have an extremely low <b>elasticity</b> <b>of</b> demand because no substitutes exist.|$|E

Earlier studies have formulated separability restrictions in terms <b>of</b> the Allen <b>elasticities</b> <b>of</b> substitution. The Hicks and Antonelli <b>elasticities</b> <b>of</b> complementarity are presented to examine separability of production (utility) and distance functions. Whereas the Allen <b>elasticities</b> <b>of</b> substitution are valid under homothetic separability, the Hicks <b>elasticities</b> <b>of</b> complementarity are a universally relevant measure of separability {{for the production}} (utility) function.

40|$|<b>Elasticities</b> <b>of</b> ? {{indicate}} {{the influence of}} demographic parameters on both individual fitness and population growth for a population with density-independent growth. Here we discuss the extension <b>of</b> <b>elasticity</b> analysis to populations with density-dependent demographic parameters and examine {{the circumstances in which}} the standard density-independent analysis gives useful information for populations that are, in reality, density dependent. In the presence of density dependence the fitness of one strategy depends upon {{what the rest of the}} population is doing. <b>Elasticities</b> <b>of</b> fitness must therefore be calculated using invasibility methods, and the resulting <b>elasticities</b> <b>of</b> the invasion exponent ? are not necessarily identical with <b>elasticities</b> <b>of</b> mean or equilibrium population size. The former are of interest in evolutionary studies; the latter in population management. If a population has a stable equilibrium and density dependence is a function of the total number of individuals in the population, then <b>elasticities</b> <b>of</b> fitness are equal to <b>elasticities</b> <b>of</b> ?, and <b>elasticities</b> <b>of</b> equilibrium population size are proportional to these. Even at equilibrium, <b>elasticities</b> <b>of</b> population size are not necessarily proportional to <b>elasticities</b> <b>of</b> ? when density dependence is a function of the number of individuals in only part of the population, as in populations regulated by competition between juveniles. <b>Elasticities</b> <b>of</b> ? are also a relatively poor guide to <b>elasticities</b> <b>of</b> population size when population numbers fluctuate. Thus, if density dependence operates at any stage in the life history, ignoring it can result in elasticity analyses that are a misleading guide for population management. In the presence of stochastic environmental variation, <b>elasticities</b> <b>of</b> ? calculated for the observed mean projection matrix are often a quite accurate approximation to <b>elasticities</b> <b>of</b> fitness, even when population fluctuations are large. An elasticity analysis on an observed mean projection matrix will often give useful information regarding selection pressures on individual demographic parameters, although this approximation usually performs poorly for populations with nonequilibrium dynamics. Whether one is interested in life history evolution or population management, the amount of work involved in carrying out a density-dependent elasticity analysis is small, relative to the amount of work involved in quantifying demographic parameters in the field populations. It will therefore usually be worth carrying out some nonlinear analyses using plausible patterns of density dependence and environmental stochasticity to ensure that an appropriate elasticity analysis is used...|$|R

5|$|Beryllium is a steel {{gray and}} hard metal that is brittle at room {{temperature}} and has a close-packed hexagonal crystal structure. It has exceptional stiffness (Young's modulus 287 GPa) and a reasonably high melting point. The modulus of <b>elasticity</b> <b>of</b> beryllium is approximately 50% {{greater than that of}} steel. The combination of this modulus and a relatively low density results in an unusually fast sound conduction speed in beryllium – about 12.9km/s at ambient conditions. Other significant properties are high specific heat (1925 J·kg−1·K−1) and thermal conductivity (216 W·m−1·K−1), which make beryllium the metal with the best heat dissipation characteristics per unit weight. In combination with the relatively low coefficient of linear thermal expansion (11.4×10−6 K−1), these characteristics result in a unique stability under conditions of thermal loading.|$|E

Employment of certain measures such as Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and ventilation at higher-than-normal pressures may be helpful in maintaining adequate oxygenation.

Mechanical ventilation can also cause pulmonary barotrauma when high pressure is required to ventilate the lungs.

5|$|Analysis of the jaw {{structure}} of Carnotaurus by Mazzetta and colleagues (1998, 2004, 2009) {{suggests that the}} animal was capable of quick bites, but not strong ones. Quick bites {{are more important than}} strong bites when capturing small prey, as shown by studies of modern-day crocodiles. These researchers also noted a high degree of flexibility (kinesis) within the skull and especially the lower jaw, somewhat similar to modern snakes. <b>Elasticity</b> <b>of</b> the jaw would have allowed Carnotaurus to swallow small prey items whole. In addition, the front part of the lower jaw was hinged, and thus able to move up and down. When pressed downwards, the teeth would have projected forward, allowing Carnotaurus to spike small prey items; when the teeth were curved upwards, the now backward projecting teeth would have hindered the caught prey from escaping. Mazzetta and colleagues also found that the skull was able to withstand forces that appear when tugging on large prey items. Carnotaurus may therefore have fed mainly on relatively small prey, but also was able to hunt large dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|As a result, {{the distal}} {{arm of the}} third {{axillary}} sclerite rotates upwards and inwards, so that finally its position is completely reversed. The anal veins are articulated with this sclerite {{in such a way}} that when it moves they are carried with it and become flexed over the back of the insect. Activity of the same muscle in flight affects the power output of the wing and so it is also important in flight control. In orthopteroid insects, the <b>elasticity</b> <b>of</b> the cuticle causes the vannal area of the wing to fold along the veins. Consequently, energy is expended in unfolding this region when the wings are moved to the flight position.

The authors calibrate an extended version of the model in order to examine the effect of a subsidy to Airbus by European governments, and its presence in a market which can only support two firms at most, worldwide. They find that the subsidy had an unambiguously negative effect on welfare of the United States and a positive effect on rest of the world, which benefits from lower prices. The result for Europe hinges on price <b>elasticity</b> <b>of</b> demand; for relatively inelastic demand the net effect of subsidy is positive with most of the benefits accruing to European consumers, but for elastic demand, social welfare in Europe goes down. Importantly, unlike in the baseline Brander and Spencer model, Krugman and Baldwin find that the changes to consumer surplus resulting from the subsidy and entry, dominate the effect of changes in firm profits in social welfare calculations.|$|E
5|$|The size of {{the rebound}} effect is {{determined}} by the price <b>elasticity</b> <b>of</b> demand for the good. In a perfectly competitive market where fuel is the sole input used, if the price of fuel remains constant but efficiency is doubled, the effective price of travel would be halved (twice as much travel can be purchased). If in response, the amount of travel purchased more than doubles (i.e. demand is price elastic), then fuel consumption would increase, and the Jevons paradox would occur. If demand is price inelastic, the amount of travel purchased would less than double, and fuel consumption would decrease. However, goods and services generally use more than one type of input (e.g. fuel, labour, machinery), and other factors besides input cost may also affect price. These factors tend to reduce the rebound effect, making the Jevons paradox less likely to occur.|$|E
