5|$|As a {{tropical}} cyclone, Paine brought rainfall {{to most of}} Mexico, including heavier amounts along the coastline and interior northern Oaxaca. The highest total in the country was 12.01inches (30.5cm) in Apazulco, Jalisco. Light precipitation <b>fell</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southern portion of the Baja California Peninsula, and where Paine moved ashore, upwards of 7inches (18cm) fell across its path. In the area around where it made landfall, strong winds knocked down trees and caused disruptions to city services.|$|E

5|$|Halley {{may have}} been {{recorded}} as early as 467BC, but this is uncertain. A comet was recorded in ancient Greece between 468 and 466 BC; its timing, location, duration, and associated meteor shower all suggest it was Halley. According to Pliny the Elder, that same year a meteorite <b>fell</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> town of Aegospotami, in Thrace. He described it as brown in colour {{and the size of}} a wagon load.

5|$|July 2 - Hurricane Arthur passed {{just off}} the coast of Eastern Florida.

The government believed that if copper prices <b>fell</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future, similar effects would be experienced. The colonial administration implemented two schemes to maintain the relationship of urban workers with their rural homelands. Health-service expenditures by rural relatives of urban workers were borne by the government, and the rural male migration of the working population was reduced.|$|E
5|$|The First World War {{memorial}} in Grove Park, containing a sculpture by Alfred Drury, was unveiled in 1922, with additions by Walter Cave for the Second World War.

5|$|Dibnah {{had watched}} the {{activities}} of steeplejacks throughout his childhood, and witnessed his first chimney felling from his father's allotment near Bolton's greyhound track at Raikes Park.

They then lit a fire, destroying the supports and causing the chimney to collapse. Unfortunately, on this occasion the chimney <b>fell</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wrong direction, onto the greyhound track's dog kennels, a local cafe and a series of power cables.|$|E

After moving to Broadhurst Park in May 2015, the club averaged a gate of 3,394 in 2015–16, a season-on-season increase of over 57% and the fourth highest attendance in non-League football.|$|E

5|$|Fishers {{have few}} predators besides humans. They have been trapped since the 18th century for their fur. Their pelts were in such demand {{that they were}} extirpated from several parts of the United States {{in the early part}} of the 20th century. Conservation and {{protection}} measures have allowed the species to rebound, but their current range is still reduced from its historic limits. In the 1920s, when pelt prices were high, some fur farmers attempted to raise fishers. However, their unusual delayed reproduction made breeding difficult. When pelt prices <b>fell</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1940s, most fisher farming ended. While fishers usually avoid human contact, encroachments into forest habitats have resulted in some conflicts.|$|E
