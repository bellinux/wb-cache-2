25|$|In {{his work}} on the divine proportion, H.E. Huntley relates the feeling of reading and {{understanding}} someone else's proof of a theorem of mathematics to that of a viewer of a masterpiece of art—the reader of a proof has a similar sense of exhilaration at understanding as the original author of the proof, much as, he argues, the viewer of a masterpiece <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> exhilaration similar to the original painter or sculptor. Indeed, one can study mathematical and scientific writings as literature.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the play, Walter and Beneatha's father has recently died, and Mama is waiting for a life insurance check for $10,000. Walter <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> entitlement to the money, but Mama has religious objections to alcohol and Beneatha has to remind him it is Mama's call how to spend it. Eventually Mama puts some of the money down on a new house, choosing an all-white neighborhood over a black one for the practical reason that it happens to be much cheaper. Later she relents and gives {{the rest of the money}} to Walter to invest with the provision that he reserve $3,000 for Beneatha's education. Walter passes the money on to Willy's naive sidekick Bobo, who gives it to Willy, who absconds with it, depriving Walter and Beneatha of their dreams, though not the Youngers of their new home. Meanwhile, Karl Lindner, a white representative of the neighborhood they plan to move to, makes a generous offer to buy them out. He wishes to avoid neighborhood tensions over interracial population, which to the three women's horror Walter prepares to accept as a solution to their financial setback. Lena says that while money was something they try to work for, they should never take it if it was a person's way of telling them they weren't fit to walk the same earth as them.|$|E

Henderson explained, [...] "I don't {{have a problem}} with religion. What I {{have a problem with}} is religion posing as science.

The song <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> mystery and starts off softly and slowly with a piano introduction. It then becomes fast and melancholy, with Madonna singing: [...] "Your eyes are full of surprises/ They cannot predict my fate". The trip hop {{inspired}} [...] "Voices" [...] is the last track of the album, consisting of unresolved chords and sweeping strings, as the lyrics question who is really in control: [...] "Are you walking the dog?/ Is the dog walking you?" ...|$|E
500|$|In this cantata, Bach {{combines}} {{elements of}} ritornello and concerto writing {{to expand his}} range of structural experimentation. Although the closing chorale was a later addition, its melody is incorporated earlier in the piece, unifying the form. The theme of the text is optimistic, but the music throughout <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> underlying sadness. Craig Smith describes the cantata as [...] "one of the densest and greatest". The Bach scholar Christoph Wolff notes that the opening duet and also the duet passages on the chorus are {{in the style of}} Bach's secular cantatas written in Köthen.|$|E

After a tryout in Manchester, it opened in London at the New Theatre (renamed the Noël Coward Theatre in 2006), his first {{full-length}} play in the West End. Neville Cardus's praise in The Manchester Guardian was grudging. Notices for the London production were mixed, but encouraging. The Observer commented, [...] "Mr Coward... <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> comedy, and if he can overcome a tendency to smartness, he will probably produce a good play one of these days." [...] The Times, on the other hand, was enthusiastic: [...] "It is a remarkable piece of work from so young a head – spontaneous, light, and always 'brainy'." ...|$|E

[...] Gomez further elaborated on the concept of the song on an interview with Just Jared Jr., saying, It's basically about Hollywood and what people think about it and essentially how plastic it is sometimes. It's fun and I think girls can relate to it somewhat, for me it was because of Hollywood but it can really relate to a mean girl, an ex-boyfriend, to whoever.|$|E
500|$|Most {{critics were}} not {{impressed}} with the medley, comparing it to Aguilera's identity during the Bionic era. Tamar Anitai, also of MTV Buzzworthy summarized the performance saying it [...] "was all about her [...] "I-I'm-still-a-diva" [...] vocals, frenzied stage show, and adult-only innuendo...And then this happened." [...] She went on to comment also sarcastically, [...] "This is so just Christina Aguilera's way of saying she loves you! And that the diminutive diva still <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humor....It's like a little knowing wink that assures you that when she's not changing diapers and doing mommy stuff, Mamaguilera's hanging out at dance party sex dungeons and wailing {{from the bottom of}} her light-up hoo-ha.

Within the model developed in this research, dimensions of being a clinical educator were identified. These dimensions include (<b>a)</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> self (and the impact of bringing self into the clinical educator’s role), (b) <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> relationship with others (and the place of this ‘‘interactive self’’ as a central feature of clinical education), (c) <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> being <b>a</b> clinical educator (and how this understanding relates to the previous two dimensions), (d) <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> agency (which is vital to the performance of many clinical education roles), (e) seeking dynamic self-congruence, and (e) growth as a clinical educator.

500|$|In 2013, {{the team}} had {{released}} Fuse, which was a critical and commercial failure. The team now reflected on the reasons for its poor reception, and felt that they {{should go back to}} Insomniac's roots — developing unusual titles with vibrant visuals — instead of another dark shooter like Fuse. They also thought that Sunset Overdrives stylization should reflect the personality of the company, and that building a world that <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humor and irreverence was something the team was eager to do. Ted Price, CEO of Insomniac Games, described it as a game Insomniac had wanted to develop for a long time. The game's producer, Bryan Intihar, called it: [...] "...the game [...] been meaning to make for 20 years." [...] Microsoft supported it and shared the same vision and the idea of creating something new.|$|E
500|$|Silver {{received}} a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Masters award in 1995, {{and in the}} following year was added to Down Beats Jazz Hall of Fame. He moved from Columbia to Impulse! Records, where he made the septet The Hardbop Grandpop (1996) and the quintet A Prescription for the Blues (1997). The former was nominated for two Grammy Awards: as an album for best instrumental performance, individual or group; and for Silver's solo on [...] "Diggin' on Dexter". He was again unwell in 1997, so was unable to tour to promote his records. His final studio recording was made {{in the following year}} – Jazz <b>Has</b> <b>a</b> <b>Sense</b> <b>of</b> Humor, for Verve Records. One continuation from his early career was that Silver recorded his own compositions for his later albums and they were typically new, rather than re-workings of previous releases.|$|E
500|$|Silent Alarm was {{released}} on 2and14 February 2005, in Japan and Europe respectively. Chosen because the album <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> disquiet, the name comes from an article in New Scientist about an early detection system for earthquakes in Japan, while the cover art {{is based on a}} bare winter landscape by freelance photographer Ness Sherry. Bloc Party followed the album's release with a short European promotional tour in early March 2005. Between 17 March and 9 April, the band undertook a first headlining US tour to coincide with the American release of Silent Alarm through Vice Records on 22 March. The US marketing was geared to establish a long-term fan base among [...] "tastemakers and early-adopter rock enthusiasts", rather than a short-term emphasis on radio play.

500|$|In a 2007 interview, {{the author}} {{described}} {{the novel as}} her [...] "Beauty and the Beast story", stating that like the Beast, Dain is an outcast and misfit among the novel's society. Chase describes Dain as [...] "truly awful: [...] rude, overbearing, and intimidating... He consciously uses his monstrousness {{in the same way}} he uses his vast wealth and his social position: to control his world and protect himself. It's sad, in a way, because he’s isolated, like the Beast of the fairy tale trapped in his castle. But Dain is not pitiful by any means: [...] He’s smart, cynical, and sarcastic, with a sharp eye for the ridiculous. He <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humor and is adept with clever comebacks and putdowns". Jessica represents the Beauty of the story, someone who [...] "enters the Beast’s lair of her own accord" [...] as his equal [...] "no matter how awful" [...] he acts.|$|E
500|$|Director Chris Buck {{believed}} that Menzel's vocals would {{help in the}} portrayal of the character, saying, [...] "Idina <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> vulnerability in her voice. She plays a very strong character, but someone who lives in fear—so we needed someone who could portray {{both sides of the}} character, and Idina was just amazing." [...] Menzel was unaccustomed to working with animated films and being required to portray her character's feelings with her voice alone, though she did not find it particularly challenging. While recording, she was able to [...] "play" [...] with her voice, trying various tones to establish the ranges in Elsa's emotions. For example, Menzel wanted there to be a difference between the ways she sounded when she was being bold and when she was angry. She would also physically restrict her hands from moving as she recorded the film's early scenes in order to project how her character was [...] "so afraid to move and feel anything that it would come out and hurt people".|$|E

It was a cool concept too because it was kind of one side of me and now, it's evolving into the new colorful stuff that we've been doing." [...] In {{an interview}} for MTV News, Guetta explained his role in the music video, saying [...] "I'm DJing from a spaceship. It's actually really funny, because we shot that in Los Angeles in a place where they used to shoot Star Trek, but like the old ones. And so it's kind of retro futuristic, you know? It's like how people were seeing the future back in the 80s. It <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humor in the video."

500|$|In {{film editor}} Susan Korda's 2005 lecture, [...] "We'll Fix It in the Edit!?", at the Berlinale Talent Campus, she broadly {{explained}} {{the contribution of}} editing to the film: [...] "What is fascinating in Jaws is that the shark has a personality, the shark has an intelligence, indeed sometimes I think the shark <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humor, morbid as it might be. And that was all achieved {{in the first two}} acts of the film before you see the shark. So the cutting was very essential for that." [...] David Bordwell has used the second shark attack scene in Jaws as (literally) a textbook illustration of an editing innovation that occurred in the late 1960s. The innovation, which Fields herself named the [...] "wipe by cut", can be used when a character is filmed from a distance using a telephoto lens. The cut to a different framing of the character occurs during the interruption by a figure who passes between the camera and the character. The cut thus masks itself, and avoids drawing the viewer's attention away from the narrative of the scene.|$|E

[...] "Koppelman's concern is man, good and evil... He is a superb technician whose work has grandeur and emotional impact," [...] wrote Bennett Schiff. [...] "Chaim Koppelman brings a totally new concept and technique to the field of graphic art," [...] wrote critic and gallery director Sylvan Cole, Jr. [...] "Siegel's Theory of Opposites has had a profound effect upon his work". Una Johnson, Curator Emeritus of Prints and Drawings at the Brooklyn Museum said, [...] "He has harnessed his skills and his unblinking imagery to the troubled, often controversial problems of our times." [...] Fellow artist Will Barnet said, [...] "He was brilliant, both in printmaking and painting. His work <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> darkness and light that is unique...
