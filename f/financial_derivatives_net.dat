40|$|This study {{explored}} the {{foreign exchange risk}} management practices by JSE-listed companies, specifically non-financial companies. The investigation {{was based on the}} experienced practices in 2015. A web-based survey was used to source data from the population and yielded a 37 % response rate. Transactional risk is the most prioritised form of foreign exchange exposure. Surprisingly, economic exposure is also highly regarded by JSE non-financial firms. Translational risk is the least prioritised form of foreign exchange risk. There is a significant statistical relationship between the frequency at which firms manage economic risk, and the industry to which they belong. Consistent with the prescriptive theory, the study found that a significant majority of firms used internal or operational hedging techniques in combination with <b>financial</b> <b>derivatives.</b> <b>Netting</b> is the predominately used internal hedging technique by the survey respondents. There is a significant relationship between a firm's usage of netting as an internal hedging technique and the percentage of foreign currency denominated expenses. Forward contracts are the preferred <b>financial</b> <b>derivative</b> used to hedge foreign exchange exposure. The study reveals that the manner in which firms use forward contracts is significantly influenced by their percentage of foreign currency denominated expenses. It is noted that a strategic decision with respect to management of foreign exchange risk in JSE non-financial firms falls within the purview of a firm's executive management...|$|R
40|$|Measuring and {{managing}} {{exchange rate risk}} exposure is important for reducing a firm''s vulnerabilities from major exchange rate movements, which could adversely affect profit margins {{and the value of}} assets. This paper reviews the traditional types of exchange rate risk faced by firms, namely transaction, translation and economic risks, presents the VaR approach as the currently predominant method of measuring a firm''s exchange rate risk exposure, and examines the main advantages and disadvantages of various exchange rate risk management strategies, including tactical versus strategical and passive versus active hedging. In addition, it outlines a set of widely accepted best practices in managing currency risk and presents some of the main hedging instruments in the OTC and exchange-traded markets.

50|$|The measure {{preferred}} by the Office of the Comptroller is net current credit exposure (NCCE), which measures {{the risk to}} banks and the <b>financial</b> system in <b>derivatives</b> contracts.

The difference between the market value of US derivatives and the credit exposure to the financial system is due to netting - financial institutions tend to have many positions with their counterparties that have positive and negative values, resulting in a much smaller exposure than the sum of the market values of their <b>derivative</b> positions. <b>Netting</b> reduces the credit exposure of the US <b>financial</b> system to <b>derivatives</b> by more than 90%, as compared to 50.6% at the beginning of 1998.|$|R
