40|$|Housing {{prices in}} the United States could {{continue}} to fall {{for many years to}} come. Losses could grow and eventually lead to bank <b>insolvencies.</b> Once the fear of prospective <b>insolvencies</b> in U. S. financial institutions spreads in the market, ordinary monetary policy becomes powerless since liquidity provision works only if all financial institutions in the payment network are solvent. With the problem being in the payment system, fiscal policy to save mortgage borrowers cannot restore market confidence. Capital augmentations by banks themselves only buy time but cannot stabilize the financial system if the market feels that bank <b>insolvencies</b> are inevitable. A payment system facing <b>insolvencies</b> becomes caught up in a game of musical chairs, in which each party tries to push the prospective losses on the others. To stabilize the payment system, the U. S. government should eliminate fear in the market. One promising policy plan is to set up a scheme and a sufficient public fund for capital injection into banks in the case of <b>insolvencies.</b> This scheme would stabilize the market by eliminating fear, and public funds would not actually be injected into banks. 1.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we empirically analyze the {{macroeconomic}} detenninants of <b>insolvencies</b> in Germany since 1970. It is {{shown that the}} growth rate of <b>insolvencies</b> can be explained by changes in the rate of return to capital and by preceding changes in the money market interest rate and the inflation rate, as well as by lagged effects of preceding changes in bankruptcies. We also find that Gennan unification contributed to a rise of bankruptcy rates both in West Gennany and in East Germany...|$|R
5|$|A {{relatively}} advanced {{theory of}} interest is also presented. Cantillon believed that interest originates from the need of borrowers for capital and from the fear of loss of the lenders, meaning that borrowers have to recompense lenders for {{the risk of the}} possible <b>insolvency</b> of the debtor. In turn, interest is paid out of earned profits originating from the return on invested capital. While previously it was believed that the rate of interest varied inversely to the quantity of money, Cantillon posited that the rate of interest was determined by the supply and demand on the loanable funds market—an insight usually attributed to Scottish philosopher David Hume. As such, while saved money impacts the rate of interest, new money that is instead used for consumption does not; Cantillon's theory {{of interest is}} therefore similar to John Maynard Keynes's liquidity preference theory.|$|E
5|$|From {{the release}} of Dr. No (1962) to For Your Eyes Only (1981), the films were {{distributed}} solely by United Artists. When Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer absorbed United Artists in 1981, MGM/UA Entertainment Co. was formed and distributed the films until 1995. MGM solely distributed three films from 1997 to 2002 after United Artists was retired as a mainstream studio. From 2006 to present, MGM and Columbia Pictures have co-distributed the film series, following the 2005 acquisition of MGM by a consortium led by Columbia's parent company, Sony Pictures Entertainment. In November 2010, MGM filed for bankruptcy; following its emergence from <b>insolvency,</b> Columbia has been co-production partner of the series with Danjaq until Sony's distribution rights to the franchise comes to the end with {{the release of}} Spectre.|$|E
5|$|After {{establishing}} a legal {{career in the}} field of <b>insolvency,</b> Stevenson served during the Second World War as a Deputy Judge Advocate General of the Armed Forces. He was subsequently Judge Advocate at the 1945 war crimes trial of former personnel of the German submarine U-852 for their actions in {{what became known as the}} Peleus affair. In 1954 Stevenson represented the government of British Kenya during Jomo Kenyatta's unsuccessful appeal against his conviction for membership of the rebel organisation Mau Mau. Later that year he represented the litigants in the Crichel Down affair, which led to changes in the law on compulsory purchase. In 1955 he defended Ruth Ellis, the last woman to be executed for murder in the United Kingdom, and two years later took part in the unsuccessful prosecution of suspected serial killer John Bodkin Adams. He was deeply distressed by the execution of Ellis, for whom there had been no defence in law, but who was expected to have been reprieved by Home Secretary Gwilym Lloyd George.|$|E

5|$|By 1950, Boosey & Hawkes was {{a leading}} {{international}} music company with an extensive catalogue of serious composers and offices in Bonn, Johannesburg, New York, Paris, Toronto and Sydney. However, from the late 1940s, strains had begun {{to appear in the}} relationship between Leslie Boosey and Ralph Hawkes, and this led to factions supporting each man forming in the company. It was discovered that Hawkes had borrowed capital of £100,000 during the war without the permission of the exchange control authorities, and Boosey was forced to clear up the situation at great personal cost. Hawkes secretly wanted to buy out the music publishing side of the business and manage it from New York, leaving Boosey in London with the musical instrument business which Hawkes found dull. However, he died suddenly on 8 September 1950, and representation of his faction was taken over by his flamboyant but unreliable brother Geoffrey who spent much of the company's money on ventures such as the manufacture of mouth organs and ovens, which failed. Geoffrey Hawkes also sold shares in the company to fund his philandering, {{to the point that the}} company was forced to go public to raise cash. Leslie Boosey allowed Geoffrey his turn as chairman, but within two years the profitable company was on the brink of <b>insolvency</b> and Geoffrey Hawkes died of leukaemia in 1961.|$|E
5|$|McKinley {{was born}} in 1843 in Niles, Ohio. After service as an Army officer in the Civil War, he became a lawyer and settled in Canton, Ohio. In 1876 {{he was elected to}} Congress, and he {{remained}} there most of the time until 1890, when he was defeated for re-election in a gerrymandered district. By this time he was considered a likely presidential candidate, especially after being elected governor in 1891 and 1893. McKinley had incautiously co-signed the loans of a friend, and demands for repayment were made on him when his friend went bankrupt in the Panic of 1893. Personal <b>insolvency</b> would have removed McKinley as a factor in the 1896 campaign, but he was rescued from this by businessmen who supported him, led by his friend and political manager, Mark Hanna. With that obstacle removed, Hanna built McKinley's campaign organization through 1895 and 1896. McKinley refused to deal with the eastern bosses such as Thomas Platt and Matthew Quay, and they tried to block his nomination by encouraging state favorite son candidates to run and prevent McKinley from getting a majority of delegate votes at the Republican National Convention, which might force him to make deals on political patronage. Their efforts were in vain, as the large, efficient McKinley organization swept him to a first ballot victory at the convention, with New Jersey's Garret Hobart as his running mate.|$|E

40|$|The {{motivation}} for this paper {{lies with the}} prediction of company <b>insolvencies</b> in the UK using macroeconomic factors and adopting four alternative modelling approaches: ordinary least squares (OLS), ARMA, Logit and neural network regression (NNR). ARMA models are used as a benchmark for assessing {{the results of the}} other forecasting methods. Using relevant macroeconomic variables, the four models are first estimated in-sample with quarterly data for the period ranging from 1980 Q 1 until 1998 Q 1. Then, assessing traditional forecasting accuracy criteria and using the ARMA methodology as a benchmark, these models are tested out-of-sample over the period 1998 Q 2 - 2001 Q 1. The results clearly show that NNR models achieve superior performance in predicting UK company <b>insolvencies</b> compared to the benchmark ARMA model and the remaining two models. This indicates that Neural Networks are a very promising tool in evaluating company <b>insolvencies</b> in terms of predictive accuracy and robustness...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the accuracy of}} the principal models used by U.

Specifically, we compare the riskbased capital (RBC) system introduced by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) in 1994, the Financial Analysis and Surveillance Tracking (FAST) audit ratio system used by the NAIC, and a cash flow simulation model developed by the authors. Both the RBC and FAST systems are static, ratio-based approaches to solvency testing, whereas the cash flow simulation model implements dynamic financial analysis. Logistic regression analysis is used to test the models for a large sample of solvent and insolvent property-liability insurers, using data from the years 1990 through 1992 to predict <b>insolvencies</b> over three-year prediction horizons. We find that the FAST system dominates RBC as a static method for predicting insurer <b>insolvencies.</b> Further, we find the cash flow simulation variables add significant explanatory power to the regressions and lead to more accurate solvency prediction than the ratio-based models taken alone...|$|R
