Four concrete mixes were prepared based on a water-to-binder ratio of 0. 35. Two industrial by-products, silica fume and Class F fly ash, were used separately and together with normal portland cement to produce three concrete mixes in addition to the control mix. The properties of both fresh and hardened concretes were examined in the laboratory. The freshly mixed concrete mixes were tested for slump, slump flow, and V-funnel flow. The hardened concretes were tested for compressive strength and dynamic modulus of elasticity after exposing to 20, 35 and 50 °C. In addition, the <b>initial</b> surface <b>absorption</b> and the rate of moisture movement into the concretes were determined at 20 °C. The performance of the concretes in the fresh state was excellent due to their superior deformability and good segregation resistance. In their hardened state, the highest levels of compressive strength and dynamic modulus of elasticity were produced by silica fume concrete. In addition, silica fume concrete showed the lowest level of <b>initial</b> surface <b>absorption</b> and the lowest rate of moisture movement into the interior of concrete. In comparison, the compressive strength, dynamic modulus of elasticity, <b>initial</b> surface <b>absorption,</b> and moisture movement rate of silica fume-fly ash concrete were close to those of silica fume concrete.

Tests for density, stiffening time, bleed, settlement, sorptivity, water absorption, moisture content, California bearing ratio, <b>initial</b> surface <b>absorption,</b> and compressive strength were carried out on the CLSM mixtures.

In general, the concretes with LWA particles had <b>initial</b> water <b>absorption,</b> sorptivity and water permeability similar to or lower than those of the control concrete and the concrete with SRA. The charges passed, chloride migration coefficient and chloride diffusion coefficient of such concretes were in the same order as those of the control concrete and the concrete with SRA. However, the incorporation of the LWAs for internal curing reduced unit weight, compressive strength and elastic modulus of the concrete. Comparing the LWAs of different sizes for internal curing, finer particles were more efficient in reducing the shrinkage and generally resulted in less reduction in the unit weight, compressive strength, and elastic modulus. However, the increase in the more porous crushed LW particles in concrete seems to increase the penetration of chloride ions in the concrete. The concrete with SRA had <b>initial</b> water <b>absorption,</b> sorptivity, water permeability and resistance to chloride ion penetration comparable with those of the control concrete.
