40|$|Abstract: Uninsured Americans are {{a growing}} {{population}} as insurance premiums climb and fewer employers offer health coverage. Providing {{medical care to}} the uninsured often represents a significant financial loss to medical institutions. Our study sought to describe the <b>insurance</b> <b>history</b> and barriers to obtaining health coverage for uninsured patients at the Community Health Center of Burlington, Vermont (CHCB). The potential benefit of adding an insurance eligibility position to the staff at CHCB was also explored. Data were collected by random phone survey from 100 CHCB patients identified as uninsured at their last visit; patients were queried regarding <b>insurance</b> <b>history</b> and interest in enrollment assistance. At the time of survey 66 % were currently uninsured, and the majority (87. 9 %) of these respondents previously held insurance. Loss of insurance was most often due {{to a change in}} job status, income or a change in eligibility. Cost was a major barrier to insurance noted by individuals; on average respondents indicated {{they would be willing to}} pay around $ 65 per month for overage. A majority (75. 7 %) of uninsured respondents also expressed interest in an onsite eligibility worker. These data suggest that the patient population at CHCB would be well served by implementing some form of eligibility staffing. There are a number of different health insurance options in Vermont that could benefit these patients, provided they have assistance with applying. Due to the small sample size of our survey, we recommend that the scope of the eligibility position be determined by closely examining the caseload encountered. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} pension {{harmonisation}} on individual pension levels {{can be shown}} by applying {{the provisions of the}} General Retirement Income Act (APG) to the insurance patterns of persons retiring and receiving their first old-age pensions in 2002 - 03. For men, the General Retirement Income Act results in a reduction of gross pension benefits and a lower income replacement ratio, i. e., the ratio between the first retirement income and the last earned income. The extent of the reduction depends on the retirement age and, in particular, the deductions due to early retirement (corridor pension). In case of a long contributory period (traditional employment pattern), the income replacement ratio drops by 6 percentage points, while for persons with unstable insurance patterns the income replacement ratio according to APG will be about 14 percentage points lower than according to ASVG (General Social Insurance Act). These losses can be mitigated through continued employment up to the statutory retirement age and offset for persons with a traditional <b>insurance</b> <b>history.</b> Pensionsreform Allgemeines Pensionsgesetz Pensionshöhe Einkommensersatzrate...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the causes and {{historical}} impact of the Armstrong investigation into the practices of the life insurance industry. As a long-time admirer of Charles Evans Hughes, and a serious student of the history of insurance, I found the opportunity of looking into an important part of Hughes's early career and the most significant event in the annals of <b>insurance</b> <b>history</b> to be especially compelling, particularly as my research came to show the need to re-assess much of what previously has been written about the episode. In addition to basic resource materials available at Bracken Library, I found that extensive use of contemporary newspaper accounts, principally those in the Chicago Tribune andNew York Times, revealed the vivid images that caught so well the attention and imagination of the American public in 1905. I also have made valuable use of James Hazen Hyde's personal papers in the archival section of Baker Library at Harvard University. This important collection of private correspondence and records has been largely overlooked by insurance historians writing about the period. Those who have written about the New York Times also have ignored the Hyde material, most significantly the items linking the financial condition of the New York Times with the Equitable Life Assurance Society, the principal firm in the great financial scandal. That embarrassing link explains the newspaper's restrained and even bland reporting and editorials concerning the unfolding events. Little mention is given the Armstrong investigation in the insurance textbooks used in American colleges and universities. The occasional references to the most important public investigative body of its time are limited to phrases beginning with "because of" or "prior to" and rarely provide more than a minimal amount of background explanation. Certainly more of the history of insurance needs to be taught. While institutions of higher learning offer students the opportunity to study the history of many subjects, such as art, music, medicine, law, and economics, none of the more than two hundred universities in the country offering insurance courses includes study of the history of insurance. Of the many rich and intriguing events in the realm of insurance, the story of the Armstrong investigation, with its startling findings and resulting widespread reform legislation, should serve well as the nucleus of an <b>insurance</b> <b>history</b> text. Completion of such a textbook indeed will finish the work started by this thesis. Department of HistoryThesis (M. A. ...|$|E

40|$|THEINSURANCE CONCEPT can be {{literally}} {{traced back}} to ancient times. The Babylonian civilization in the Middle East was considered the leader in world trade of that time. Babylon {{was at the center}} of the world trade market and became an ideal focal point for goods and merchandise brought from Europe, Asia and Africa. Numerous caravans traveled through Babylon bringing valuable materials which linked China, India, Persia, and Egypt to the trade center. Unfortunately, bands of robbers and pirates as well as the natural elements were constant threats these merchants faced on their journeys. Losses of life and materials were relatively high. The Babylonian merchants charged risk premiums on the credit they extended to merchants. Merchants pledged as collat-eral their property and their family in exchange for loans on the goods. The risks of loss were very high, and i t was not uncommon for mer-chants to lose everything, whereby their families would be sold into slavery. Essentially, these high risks caused a decline in the growth of commercial trade. <b>Insurance</b> <b>History</b> Improved trade conditions did not materialize until after the Code of Hammurabi (circa 1750 B. c.).

40|$|The article {{traces the}} history of {{multinational}} enterprise (MNE) in insurance from the nineteenth century to the present, highlighting {{the importance of this}} topic. The essay breaks new ground in providing the first overall historical snapshot of MNEs in insurance. Long before the First World War, MNE insurers had substantial global interests. MNEs from the UK, the European continent, the United States and Canada in non-life and life insurance as well as in reinsurance established business around the world, obtaining substantial revenues from the operations in foreign locales. In many countries they were the innovators in the provision of this service. The article found differing patterns through time, discontinuities (exits), and a range of differences when comparing the non-life and life insurance sectors. Home and host country regulations and other government actions during war and peace always affected the historical developments and thus are not neglected in this survey. The article provides sample statistics to demonstrate the significance of MNEs in insurance. Within this article, the author seeks to identify research done and that which is in progress on the path of MNEs in insurance; it concludes that this is a topic where there is still major research to be accomplished. multinational enterprise, <b>insurance</b> <b>history,</b> history-international business, internationalization insurance, globalization, foreign investment,...|$|E

For this, {{the aim of this}} study is to investigate the frequency and effective factors of DAMA in patients with cardiovascular disease in hospital cardiac care units (CCU) of East Azerbaijan, Iran. Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed, in 2013, in Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Iran. Required information was extracted using valid and reliable forms of medical records of 2000 patients admitted to 20 CCU in 17 hospitals of East Azerbaijan, by two trained interviewers. Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistics (frequency, mean, percentage, etc.), chi-square test, and linear regression model using the SPSS software. The tests were considered a statistically significant level of 0. 05 %. Results: The results showed that 272 patients (13. 6 %) were DAMA from the hospital. The frequency of DAMA was in men more than women. The most frequency of discharge has occurred in the range of 40 - 80 years old.

40|$|The present {{investigation}} aims at identifying {{the needs of}} the Argentinean agro-business sector for climate research and information. Our approach is focused on any type of climate information from past observations to seasonal prediction and climate change projections. We tried, in particular, to evaluate the possible existence of specific research themes that would be of major interest for these agriculture end-users. We interviewed representatives of seventeen companies from three major agrobusiness sectors: (1) regional/national entities such as agricultural associations, cooperatives and commercial trade boards; (2) insurance companies in the Argentinean agro-insurance market; and (3) large national and international companies representing cereal producers, agro-chemistry and agro-seeds. While all the interviewees recognized the strong influence of climate on their activities, they all pointed out that, at the time of making decision, they considered the political and economic risks rather than the climate one. In many aspects, climate is often considered as a fatality against which it is difficult to be protected. An interesting result is the confidence of the private sectors in the climate information provided by public sources (INTA, SMN, Universities) although they contract private consultants for frequent reports and tendencies. Finally, we explain how such sectors could make a better use of climate information (seasonal prediction, climate change scenarios) that could be integrated in their business projections. In particular, the development of new financial contracts (climate derivatives) open in countries with a relatively poor <b>insurance</b> <b>history</b> new ways to protect the different agricultural sectors, from the producer to large companies...|$|E
