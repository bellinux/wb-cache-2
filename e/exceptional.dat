5|$|The site is {{characterized}} by a mosaic of 17 plant communities regrouped into three main types of ecological units: grassy open areas, shrubby areas and wooded areas. Of these, three are listed in the Habitats Directive. The calcareous rocky slopes with chasmophytic vegetation Cystopterido fragilis-Asplenietum scolopendrii are considered as <b>exceptional,</b> with a degree of uncertainty in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region. Hydrophilous tall herb fringe community with Petasites hybridus, at the limit of its range, is also <b>exceptional.</b> The herbaceous fringe with red campion (Silene dioica) et wood forget-me-not (Myosotis sylvatica) (Sileno dioicae - Myosotidetum sylvaticae) is very rare in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais. The wood-fringe Lathyro sylvestris – Astragaletum glycyphylli is also regionally interesting.|$|E
5|$|US Navy <b>exceptional</b> {{exposure}} tables use an 8 compartment Haldanean model {{developed by}} Workman, with half-times of 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 120, 160 and 240 minutes, {{and are not}} compatible {{with the rest of}} the US Navy Air tables for repetitive diving, although for convenience they have been appended to the standard US Navy Air tables. The tables warn that no repetitive diving is permitted following an <b>exceptional</b> exposure dive, and although the 240-minute tissue would only desaturate completely in 24 hours, there is no restriction to assuming an unsaturated diver after 12 hours.|$|E

5|$|Although {{many people}} believe this owl has <b>exceptional</b> night vision, its retina is no more {{sensitive}} than a human's and its asymmetrically placed ears are key to its hunting by giving it excellent directional hearing. Its nocturnal habits and eerie, easily imitated call, {{have led to a}} mythical association of the tawny owl with bad luck and death.|$|E
5|$|As {{with any}} non-repeating calendar, the Maya {{measured}} time from a fixed start point. The Maya set {{the beginning of}} their calendar as the end of a previous cycle of bak'tuns, equivalent to a day in 3114 BC. This was believed by the Maya to be the day of the creation of the world in its current form. The Maya used the Long Count Calendar to fix any given day of the Calendar Round within their current great Piktun cycle consisting of either 20 bak'tuns. There was some variation in the calendar, specifically texts in Palenque demonstrate that the piktun cycle that ended in 3114 BC had only 13 bak'tuns, and other inscriptions seem to have used an <b>exceptional</b> cycle of 13 + 20 bak'tun in the current piktun. Additionally, there may have been some regional variation in how these <b>exceptional</b> cycles were managed.|$|E
5|$|Ballas and {{carbonado}} diamond are <b>exceptional,</b> as {{they are}} polycrystalline and therefore much tougher than single-crystal diamond; they are used for deep-drilling bits and other demanding industrial applications. Particular faceting shapes of diamonds {{are more prone to}} breakage and thus may be uninsurable by reputable insurance companies. The brilliant cut of gemstones is designed specifically to reduce the likelihood of breakage or splintering.|$|E
5|$|Communities with {{demonstrated}} {{loyalty to}} Rome retained their own laws, could collect their own taxes locally, and in <b>exceptional</b> cases were exempt from Roman taxation.

5|$|Opposing Force was {{received}} well by critics, many describing {{it as the}} new benchmark title for expansion packs, {{in a similar fashion}} to how Half-Life revolutionized the first-person shooter genre. Other reviewers, however, thought that the game still had many of the negative aspects of other expansion packs, although it was still regarded as an <b>exceptional</b> add-on.|$|E
5|$|Relatively {{few were}} sold to the coin {{collecting}} community, {{and the majority of}} surviving specimens display the effects of careless handling. The 2015 deluxe edition of Richard S.

5|$|The {{chemical}} {{reacts with}} moisture {{on the skin}} and in the eyes, causing a burning sensation and the immediate forceful and uncontrollable shutting of the eyes. Effects usually include tears streaming from the eyes, profuse coughing, <b>exceptional</b> nasal discharge that is full of mucus, burning in the eyes, eyelids, nose and throat areas, disorientation, dizziness and restricted breathing. It will also burn the skin where sweaty and/or sunburned. In highly concentrated doses it can also induce severe coughing and vomiting. Almost all of the immediate effects wear off within an hour (such as <b>exceptional</b> nasal discharge and profuse coughing), although the feeling of burning and highly irritated skin may persist for hours. Affected clothing {{will need to be}} washed several times or thrown away.|$|E
5|$|The coins {{were struck}} in August 1925 in San Francisco, and were sold the {{following}} month.
