40|$|The labor {{contract}} usually assigns significant {{authority to}} the employer (hierarchical governance). The threat of hold-up of the employee by the employer, caused by this asymmetric distribution of decision rights, can be mitigated by a preference for reciprocity {{on the part of}} the employer or by a balance of power arising from the credible threat by the employee to retaliate if he or she is exploited. The authors of this working paper investigate the interaction between the <b>employer</b> <b>s</b> preferences for reciprocity and the feasibility and willingness to punish hostile behavior by the employee in an overlapping generations model where there is cultural transmission of preferences. The results show that if the net gains from specific investment are high enough, and the quantity of feasible punishment (i. e., the worker s power) is also high, the economy will converge from any initial condition to an efficient cooperative equilibrium. If either of these conditions does not hold, the market will settle down in an inefficient equilibrium where not all types of workers make specific investment or, even if they do, there is surplus destruction, because selfish firms offer low wages. Positive reciprocity {{on the part of the}} employer is not enough to achieve an efficient labor culture. There is also a need for a significant allocation of power to the workers, so as to make the threat of punishment a powerful tool to enhance efficiency and cooperation.

U. <b>S.</b> <b>employers</b> were found to devote less time and fewer resources to training entry-level blue-collar, clerical, and service employees than do employers in Germany and Japan. The lower U. S. training rate was attributed to the following: higher employee turnover and higher cost of capital in the United States, lower trainability of U.

We find that the gender mix among employers plays a role in the individual hiring decisions of female members. Female employers when paired with a male employer are more likely to choose a female applicant over an equally competent male applicant. Results of an Implicit Association Test (IAT) and answers to a post-experimental questionnaire show that explicit beliefs about relative gender performance are significantly associated with the observed hiring bias, while implicit attitudes do not appear to play a role...|$|R

40|$|Abstract —In {{spite of}} the large and growing {{importance}} of the employer size-wage premium, previous attempts to account for this premium using observable worker or <b>employer</b> characteristic <b>s</b> have had limited success. The problem is that, while most theoretical explanation s for the size-wage premium {{are based on the}} matching of employers and employees, previous empirical work has relied on either worker surveys with little information about the employer, or establishmen t surveys with little information about the workers. In contrast, this study uses the newly created Worker-Establishment Characteristic Database, which contains linked employeremployee data for a large sample of U. S. manufacturing workers and establishments, to examine seven explanation <b>s</b> for the <b>employer</b> size-wage premium. A number of the explanation s can account for some of the observed cross-sectiona l variation in worker wages. However, none of the explanations can fully account for the employer size-wage premium.
