25|$|Pyridine is <b>harmful</b> <b>if</b> <b>inhaled,</b> {{swallowed}} or absorbed {{through the}} skin. Effects of acute pyridine intoxication include dizziness, headache, lack of coordination, nausea, salivation, {{and loss of}} appetite. They may progress into abdominal pain, pulmonary congestion and unconsciousness. One person died after accidental ingestion of {{half a cup of}} pyridine. The lowest known lethal dose (LDLo) for the ingestion of pyridine in humans is 500mg·kg−1. In high doses, pyridine has a narcotic effect and its vapor concentrations of above 3600ppm pose a health risk. The oral LD50 in rats is 891mg·kg−1. Pyridine is flammable.|$|R

5000|$|Water {{miscible}} {{oil paint}} (also called [...] "water soluble" [...] or [...] "water mixable") is oil paint either engineered or an emulsifier has been added, to be thinned and cleaned up with water, thus {{making it possible}} to avoid using chemicals such as turpentine, whose fumes may be <b>harmful</b> <b>if</b> <b>inhaled</b> (making it necessary to take precautions, such as using the solvent in a ventilated environment). Water miscible oil paint can be mixed and applied using the same techniques as traditional oil-based paint, but while still wet it can be effectively removed from brushes, palettes, and rags with ordinary soap and water. Its water solubility comes from the use of an oil medium in which one end of the molecule has been altered to bind loosely to water molecules, as in a solution.|$|R

40|$|Main Hazard : <b>Harmful</b> <b>if</b> {{swallowed}} or <b>inhaled.</b> Possible {{aspiration hazard}} if swallowed (can enter lungs and cause damage). May be irritating to the skin, eyes and respiratory tract. Over exposure may cause CNS depression. Possible reproductive hazard. Flammability: Flash Point 12 :C. Extremely flammable liquid (R 11). Ignition temperature 425 :C. Chemical Hazard : Ethanol is a flammable liquid whose vapours can form ignitable and explosive mixtures with air at normal room temperatures. Thus, an aqueous mixture containing 30 % ethanol {{can produce a}} flammable mixture of vapour and air at 29 :C, and even one containing only 5 % alcohol can produce a flammable mixture at 62 :C...|$|R
2500|$|A major study {{published}} more recently in Nature Nanotechnology suggests {{some forms of}} carbon nanotubes – a poster child for the [...] "nanotechnology revolution" [...] – could be as <b>harmful</b> as asbestos <b>if</b> <b>inhaled</b> in sufficient quantities. Anthony Seaton of the Institute of Occupational Medicine in Edinburgh, Scotland, who contributed to the article on carbon nanotubes said [...] "We {{know that some of}} them probably have the potential to cause mesothelioma. So those sorts of materials need to be handled very carefully." [...] In the absence of specific regulation forthcoming from governments, Paull and Lyons (2008) have called for an exclusion of engineered nanoparticles in food. A newspaper article reports that workers in a paint factory developed serious lung disease and nanoparticles were found in their lungs.|$|R
5|$|Pure carbon has {{extremely}} low toxicity to humans {{and can be}} handled and even ingested safely {{in the form of}} graphite or charcoal. It is resistant to dissolution or chemical attack, even in the acidic contents of the digestive tract. Consequently, once it enters into the body's tissues it is likely to remain there indefinitely. Carbon black {{was probably one of the}} first pigments to be used for tattooing, and Ötzi the Iceman was found to have carbon tattoos that survived during his life and for 5200years after his death. Inhalation of coal dust or soot (carbon black) in large quantities can be dangerous, irritating lung tissues and causing the congestive lung disease, coalworker's pneumoconiosis. Diamond dust used as an abrasive can be <b>harmful</b> <b>if</b> ingested or <b>inhaled.</b> Microparticles of carbon are produced in diesel engine exhaust fumes, and may accumulate in the lungs. In these examples, the harm may result from contaminants (e.g., organic chemicals, heavy metals) rather than from the carbon itself.|$|R
40|$|We present initial {{results from}} a novel high {{resolution}} confocal microscopy study of the 3 D surface structure of volcanic ash particles from two recent explosive basaltic eruptions, Eyjafjallajökull (2010) and Grimsvötn (2011), in Iceland. The majority of particles imaged are less than 100 μm in size and include PM 10 s, known to be <b>harmful</b> to humans <b>if</b> <b>inhaled.</b> Previous studies have mainly used 2 D microscopy to examine volcanic particles. The {{aim of this study}} was to test the potential of 3 D laser scanning confocal microscopy as a reliable analysis tool for these materials and if so to what degree high resolution surface and volume data could be obtained that would further aid in their classification. First results obtained using an Olympus LEXT scanning confocal microscope with a × 50 and × 100 objective lens are highly encouraging. They reveal a range of discrete particle types characterised by sharp or concave edges consistent with explosive formation and sudden rupture of magma. Initial surface area/volume ratios are given that may prove useful in subsequent modelling of damage to aircraft engines and human tissue where inhalation has occurred...|$|R

40|$|A recent {{chemical}} spill of 4 -Methylcyclohexanemethanol (4 -MCHM) in West Virginia left 300, 000 {{people without}} water. Officials claimed that this compound is not lethally toxic, but potentially <b>harmful</b> <b>if</b> swallowed or <b>inhaled,</b> {{and can cause}} eye and skin irritation. Sittig's Handbook of Toxic and Hazardous Chemical Carcinogens reports high exposures from skin contact or inhalation may cause damage to the heart, liver, kidneys, and lungs, and may result in death. However, no quantitative data seem to exist and no references {{can be found on}} neurotoxicity. We have investigated the neurotoxicity of 4 -MCHM using mammalian nerve cell networks grown on microelectrode arrays. Network spontaneous activity from multiple units (range 48 – 120 per network) were used as the primary readout. Individual units were followed based on spike waveforms digitized at 40 kHz (Plexon MNAP system). Dose response curves show the effective inhibitory concentration at 50 percent decrease (EC 50) to average 27. 4 microM SD± 6. 17. However, in the presence of 40 microM bicuculline, a competitive GABAA antagonist, the EC 50 shifts to 70. 63 uM SD ± 4. 3; implying that early, low concentration exposures to 4 -MCHM involve GABA activation. Initial activity loss occurs without active unit loss (defined as 10 or more template threshold crossing per min), indicating functional interference with spike production. Full recovery has not been seen at concentrations above 130 microM, unless the culture was given bicuculline. Direct exposure to 400 uM results in immediate, irreversible loss of spike production, followed by necrosis of glia and neurons...|$|R

50|$|Liquid trifluoroacetyl {{chloride}} {{can cause}} frostbite {{if it comes}} in contact with unprotected skin. <b>If</b> <b>inhaled,</b> the compound in its gaseous state will irritate the eyes, skin, and mucous membranes.

The compound is also a lacrimator. It can cause dyspnea <b>if</b> <b>inhaled</b> by mice, rats, or guinea pigs. A concentration of 35.3 parts per million of trifluoroacetyl chloride is enough to usually kill a rat in six hours.|$|R
