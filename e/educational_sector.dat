The <b>educational</b> <b>sector</b> was considerably better developed in Sleswick and Holsatia, plus in Germany, so only nobles who sent their children to foreign universities could hope to keep or obtain high offices.|$|E

Simplification of administration and delegation of authority were made the bases for improving the education system. This devolution of management to the autonomous regions, provinces, and special municipalities meant local governments had more decision-making power {{and were able to}} develop basic education. State-owned enterprises, mass organizations, and individuals were encouraged to pool funds to accomplish education reform. Local authorities used state appropriations and a percentage of local reserve financial resources (basically township financial revenues) to finance educational projects. Distance education is promoted not only within the <b>educational</b> <b>sector</b> but among basic service sectors such as agriculture and health.|$|E

25|$|Officially the {{government}} of Pakistan is committed to provide every citizen an access to education, but critics say that its budget allocation towards education does not correspond with its former commitment. The expenditure on education {{as a percentage of}} GDP was 1.82% in 2000–2001, while it has been raised slightly in 2006–2007 to 2.42%, and it is still relatively lower than most neighboring countries. Feminist economists argue that {{the government}} of Pakistan needs to fully address and resolve the gender concerns that exist in the <b>educational</b> <b>sector.</b> They suggest that one of the ways to improve this situation is by increasing funding for women's education, encourage and financially incentivize people in the rural areas to send their girls to schools. In the apprentice of gender studies, the gender division of labor is considered patriarchal, and feminists argue that it can be consciously neutralized by the public policies, i.e. encouraging girls to study mathematics, science, computers, and business administration etc. This way, girls will specialize in higher paying fields (jobs) instead of solely focusing on care work.|$|E
500|$|The Japanese {{civilian}} administration segregated the Japanese {{immigrants from}} the Palauans and adopted policies that were intended to protect {{the welfare of the}} Palauans. From the 1930s onwards, focus was later shifted towards providing more for the Japanese immigrants as the civilian administration faced difficulties in meeting the demands of an increasing immigrant population. Racial segregation was practiced in most sectors of society, but was more highly pronounced in the workforce and educational sectors. Palauans faced difficulties in getting employed in administrative positions in the workforce, which was dominated by Japanese settlers. In the <b>educational</b> <b>sector,</b> Japanese children attended mainstream primary schools (shogakko) whose lessons are based on the mainstream curriculum as with other schools on mainland Japan. Palauan children attended [...] "public schools" [...] (logakko) and attended lessons that focused on imparting skills for menial labour. Most students from [...] "Public schools" [...] dropped out after completing their elementary education and some children of Japanese fathers and Palauan mothers also faced difficulties in getting enrolled into primary schools, especially for those who were born out of wedlock.|$|E

The Indian space program remained committed to the goal of using satellites for educational purposes.

2500|$|The most {{important}} features of global citizenship education are voluntary action that can extend from local to international collectives; {{the practice of}} cultural empathy; and a focus on active participation in social and political life at the local and global level. In the late 1990s, OXFAM UK designed a curriculum for global citizenship education which stressed [...] "the 'active' role of global citizens". In this approach, individuals and groups {{both inside and outside}} the <b>educational</b> <b>sector</b> might take action that addresses human rights, trade, poverty, health, and environmental issues, for example. This is sometimes called the 'global consciousness' aspect of GCE. However, organizations such as UNESCO have also begun to emphasize 'global competencies', including science and technology into their GCE curricula, to [...] "strengthen linkages between education and economic development".|$|E
2500|$|However, {{even after}} five years of {{implementation}} of NCMP, not much progress has been seen on this front. Although the country targeted towards devoting 6% share of the GDP towards the <b>educational</b> <b>sector,</b> the performance has definitely fallen short of expectations. Expenditure on education has steadily risen from 0.64% of GDP in 1951–52 to 2.31% in 1970–71 and thereafter reached the peak of 4.26% in 2000–01. However, it declined to 3.49% in 2004–05. There is a definite need to step-up again. As a proportion of total government expenditure, it has declined from around 11.1% in 2000–2001 to around 9.98% during UPA rule, even though ideally it should be around 20% of the total budget.

They go through a two-stage education process, during which the decision of investing in higher education is left to them. Possibility for borrowers to evade debt payments imposes a constraint on credit which will impact human capital accumulation. Quality of the two <b>educational</b> <b>sectors</b> (basic and advanced) depends on public funding which is allocated to each sector.
