The different media we consider here have a bit rate between 1. 5 Mbps to 622 Mbps and use protocols such as ATM or IP. In order to minimize the number {{of different types of}} ET boards, it is interesting to study the possibility of using Network Processors (NP) to build a generic ET that is able to handle several link layer and network layer protocols and operate at a wide variety of bit rates. This report investigates the potential of implementing an ET board using a one-chip or two-chip solution using an Intel Network Processor (NP).

50|$|The {{trialkylaluminium}} dimers often {{participate in}} dynamic equilibria, {{resulting in the}} interchange of bridging and terminal ligands as well as ligand exchange between dimers. Even in noncoordinating solvents, Al-Me exchange is fast, as confirmed by proton NMR spectroscopy. For example, at −25 °C the 1H NMR spectrum of Me6Al2 comprises two signals in 1:2 ratio, as expected from the solid state structure. At 20 °C, only one signal is observed because <b>exchange</b> of <b>terminal</b> and bridging methyl groups is too fast to be resolved by NMR.

50|$|Nucleoside-diphosphate kinases (NDPKs, also NDP kinase, (poly)nucleotide kinases and {{nucleoside}} diphosphokinases) are {{enzymes that}} catalyze the <b>exchange</b> of <b>terminal</b> phosphate between different nucleoside diphosphates (NDP) and triphosphates (NTP) in a reversible manner to produce nucleotide triphosphates. Many NDP serve as acceptor while NTP are donors of phosphate group. The general reaction via ping-pong mechanism is as follows: XDP + YTP ←→ XTP + YDP (X and Y each represent different nitrogenous base). NDPK activities maintain an equilibrium between {{the concentrations of}} different nucleoside triphosphates such as, for example, when guanosine triphosphate (GTP) produced in the citric acid (Krebs) cycle is converted to adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Other activities include cell proliferation, differentiation and development, signal transduction, G protein-coupled receptor, endocytosis, and gene expression.|$|R

5000|$|TADIL J was {{designed}} as an improved data link used to exchange near real-time (NRT) information. It is a communication, navigation, and identification system that supports information exchange between tactical command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence (C4I) systems. The radio transmission and reception component of TADIL J is the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) or its successor, the Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS). These high-capacity, ultra high frequency (UHF), line of sight (LOS), frequency-hopping data communications terminals provide secure, jam-resistant voice and digital data <b>exchange.</b> JTIDS/MIDS <b>terminals</b> operate on the principal of time division multiple access (TDMA), wherein time slots are allocated among all TADIL J network participants for the transmission and reception of data.

30|$|One can now {{consider}} the time evolution of this proposed scheme for the Y-network, further looking at Fig. 7. Consider that five messages from each terminal {{are to be}} exchanged with the other terminals: the first time slot is solely used for the first MAC phase (i.e., the uplink of the messages to the relay); the second time slot {{is used for the}} first downlink phase of data, and simultaneously for the second uplink phase (i.e., for the second messages of the terminals); this procedure is repeated until the sixth time slot, which is only used for the last downlink phase of information. Hence, six time slots are required for all the messages to be <b>exchanged</b> between the <b>terminals.</b> In general, the downlink phase corresponding to the (n− 1)th message uploaded to the relay is performed during the same time slot as the uplink phase of the next nth message; consequently, the number of slots required to exchange N messages is N+ 1 and so, when N becomes large, the scheme accomplishes the message <b>exchange</b> between all <b>terminals</b> in the Y-network using only one time slot on average.|$|R

30|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the two-way relay channel (TWRC) and the multi-way {{wireless}} network with three terminals, where all three want to exchange or share data and {{have to do that}} {{with the help of a}} relay. This paper shows how it is possible to significantly decrease the number of time slots required to <b>exchange</b> messages between <b>terminals</b> in networks based on time-division multiple access (TDMA), by taking into consideration new techniques at the physical (PHY) layer. The paper considers a PHY layer where physical-layer network coding (PLNC), multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), and in-band “full-duplex” (IBFD) with loopback interference cancellation are all integrated, so that it is possible to significantly increase the overall throughput of the network. This is entirely attained by transferring the burden from the time domain to the spatial domain, via spatial multiplexing and by simultaneously resorting to non-orthogonal multiple access, which is the consequence of using both PLCN and IBFD. For the TWRC, it is shown that, if a massive MIMO relay is used, a simple lattice-based PLNC can be directly applied and, with typical IBFD interference cancellation amounts, a TWRC can effectively use only one time slot instead of the four needed when adopting the traditional TDMA exchange. In the case of the Y-network (i.e., with three terminals), a technique is presented that allows all the information <b>exchange</b> between <b>terminals</b> to be cut from the six time slots required in TDMA to only one time slot, provided that the information packets are not too short. The error performance of these systems is measured by means of simulation using MIMO Rayleigh fading channels.|$|R

Simulation results show that {{with respect to the}} conventional BDT system, the proposed algorithm can make the proposed R 2 WX system attain the same QoS requirements with less total transmission power.|$|R
