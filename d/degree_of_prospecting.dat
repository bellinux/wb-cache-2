30|$|Of equal {{importance}} to the meta-analysis and results contained in this paper is their implications for future research. As identified in the previous discussion section (Table  5), there are clear messages in this paper about the type of research {{that is needed to}} clarify the conflicting messages found in past studies, and fill substantial gaps in our knowledge. In particular, future research should test in more detail which <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>prospect</b> and refuge and also mystery would be perceived as comfortable in a natural or an urban context. Additional criteria including daylight, illumination and the venue itself—for example, is it a relatively safe area, is it a crime-intense area or are there any other hazards?—would need to be considered. Also, the relevance of refuge in such a context would be interesting to examine. Which <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>prospect</b> and refuge would achieve aesthetic quality in a natural or urban setting? Furthermore, it might be wise to test interiors that depict habitable space and which consist of more than one room, as previous studies considered mostly external views from one room but not so often internal view connections between spaces. This may change the results for refuge as well as for mystery and may identify a need for both.|$|R
40|$|Based {{upon the}} concept of “seeing without being seen”, Appleton(1975) {{proposed}} the prospect-refuge theory (P-R theory) which wasextensively used as an explanation why people prefer certain types oflandscape or an information variable to predict preference by landscaperesearchers. Although there are some applied researches related to the P-Rtheory, there still needs further examination about the rationality of P-Rtheory in landscape design and validly defining the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>prospect</b> andrefuge. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} study is to reexamine the P-R theoryand propose the possible ratios between prospect and refuge for landscapedesigners. To achieve the study purpose, the study adopts a two-stage researchmethod. In the first stage, a qualitative oriented, the study will use thetechnique of visitor employed photography (VEP) to obtain the required data(e. g., preference, the reasons why he/she prefers, experience in thesetting,…etc.) from visitors in an artificial environment (e. g., garden) and anatural environment. In-depth interviews will be implemented after visitorshave taken all the preferred photos in his/her own will. The qualitativesoftware of Altlas. ti will be used to analyze the data. Hopefully, theassociations among prospect, refuge, and preference will be reexamined. Theresults of the first research stage will act as the foundation for the secondstage research. In the second stage, a quantitative oriented, the study will use thetechnique of computer simulation to generate landscape scenes that havedifferent <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>prospect</b> and refuge. Followed by questionnaire survey,the study will be able to find out the preference of each setting which ishaving different P-R ration. Based upon the results, a practically guidance increating a preferred environment can be provided for landscape designers. 以「能夠看而不被看見」這樣的概念為基礎，Appleton 於 1975 年時提出了眺望-藏匿理論(眺匿理論) 。該理論提出後，廣泛的被研究者用來解釋為什麼人們偏好某幾種類型的景觀，或者利用眺望與藏匿作為預測偏好的訊息變項。對於眺匿理論，雖然有相關的應用性研究，但更深入探討其在景觀設計上的合理性的研究仍然不足，且當中也無法進行有效的眺望與藏匿的定義。因此本研究的目的欲重新驗證眺匿理論。更期望能界定出眺望與藏匿之間的可能比值，讓景觀設計者能有所應用。為了達成上述研究目標，本研究採用兩階段的研究方法。在第一階段，運用質性研究的方法與遊客自主性拍攝(VEP) 的技術，探討遊客在人造環境(庭園景觀) 以及自然環境中的偏好及其他所需的資料(如偏好的理由、在該場域上的體驗等) 。在遊客依其意願自行拍攝喜歡的場景後，進行深度的訪談。利用質性分析軟體Altlas. ti 來進行資料的歸納與分析。期望在這過程中可以對眺望、藏匿以及偏好間的關連性重新獲得驗證。第一階段的結果也將作為第二階段研究的基礎。第二階段採用量化研究的方式，利用電腦模擬技術來模擬不同眺望與藏匿程度的景觀場景。進而利用問卷調查，找出受測者所偏好的眺望-藏匿的比例關係。第二階段的研究成果可提供給景觀設計者應用，實際的有效的創造出人們所偏好的環境...|$|R

40|$|According to prospect-refuge theory, humans {{prefer to}} be in spaces that afford {{protection}} from threat (refuge), but also provide large fields <b>of</b> view (<b>prospect).</b> These preferences are said to arise from the adaptive advantages of such locations with respect to both avoidance of predation from refuge and survey of opportunities for resource collection by prospect. Prospect-refuge theory {{in the past has}} traditionally only been applied to human beings, but many of the same contingencies governing spatial preference ought to also hold true in other animals. If people's spatial preferences are influenced by prospect-refuge considerations, then such preferences ought to be found in other animals that are subject to the same pressures to find safety and resources. The overall objective {{of this study was to}} explore spatial preferences of the Mongolian gerbil in situations in which prospect-refuge theory makes specific predictions about which regions of an environment will be preferred. Gerbils were placed in an arena containing three dome shaped refuges that varied in the amount <b>of</b> <b>prospect</b> and refuge. A predator was released during the trial to examine how contextual factors may influence the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>prospect</b> and refuge preferred. There was a preference for an enclosed refuge at stimulus onset even though this was not reflective of what happened prior to stimulus onset, which suggests there was a shift in preferring refuges with greater concealment upon exposure to a threatening stimulus. These results indicate that shelter preference does in fact depend on contextual factors. An explicit comparison of these preferences in widely divergent species may help to place theories of spatial preference on a firmer biological footing, and may provide a greater understanding of how the principles of spatial cognition might underpin parts of the design process...|$|R

An agent follows a course of action through its environment with aim of maximizing its fitness. Navigation along that course combines the strategies of regulation, exploitation and exploration, but needs to cope with often-unforeseen diversions.

40|$|This paper {{proposes that}} the spatial pattern <b>of</b> known <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> the deposit-type sought {{is the key}} to link {{predictive}} mapping of mineral prospectivity (PMMP) and quantitative mineral resource assessment (QMRA). This proposition is demonstrated by PMMP for hydrothermal Au-Cu deposits (HACD) and by estimating the number <b>of</b> undiscovered <b>prospects</b> for HACD in Catanduanes Island (Philippines). The results of analyses of the spatial pattern <b>of</b> known <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> HACD and their spatial associations with geological features are consistent with existing knowledge of geological controls on hydrothermal Au-Cu mineralization in the island and elsewhere, and are used to define spatial recognition criteria of regional-scale prospectivity for HACD. Integration of layers of evidence representing the spatial recognition criteria of prospectivity via application of data-driven evidential belief functions results in a map of prospective areas occupying 20 % of the island with fitting- and prediction-rates of 76 % and 70 %, respectively. The predictive map of prospective areas and a proxy measure for <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> exploration based on the spatial pattern <b>of</b> known <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> HACD were used in one-level prediction of undiscovered mineral endowment, which yielded estimates of 79 to 112 undiscovered <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> HACD. Application of radial-density fractal analysis of the spatial pattern <b>of</b> known <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> HACD results in an estimate <b>of</b> 113 undiscovered <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> HACD.

In particular, by incorporating social comparison into prospect theory, we directly estimate the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> loss aversion with social comparison, a concept we term `ALJ' (Avoiding Loss relative to the Joneses). Our main findings are as follows: (i) the estimated value function is refracted at another's gain and the average estimated value of ALJ is significantly different from the unity; (ii) physical fitness influences the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> ALJ; (iii) gender influences social comparison preferences as well as ALJ; (iv) participants with a greater <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> ALJ tend not to respond to voluntary questionnaire; (v) the form of participants' ALJ is affected by the voluntary behavior of their parents.
