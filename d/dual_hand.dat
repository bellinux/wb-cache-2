During Voldo's development, several alternate designs were considered, ranging from a balding, long haired man with a goatee to a rich nobleman wielding a katar on his right hand and a sickle in his left. After his appearance and movement were fleshed out by a concept artist, his character was rendered as a 3D model by a design team that worked solely on him. During this phase the team additionally worked with the Soul Edge story creators, refining the character's own role in the plot as needed throughout development.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction This study {{aimed to}} propose {{regression}} equations for the correction of fat percentage values obtained with the WCS <b>Dual</b> <b>Hand</b> skinfold caliper, using the Lange skinfold caliper as a reference. Methods This study evaluated 112 undergraduate {{students from the}} Physical Education and Physical Therapy programs of the Faculdade Dom Bosco, located in Curitiba, Paraná, Brazil. Of these, 58 women were 24. 9 ± 5. 8 years old and 54 men were 27. 6 ± 7. 9 years old. The evaluation comprised the following measurements: height, body mass, and nine skin folds with WCS <b>Dual</b> <b>Hand</b> and Lange skinfold calipers used in biceps, triceps, subscapular, suprailiac, pectoral, average axillary, medial thigh, abdominal, and calf measurements. Results Through the simple linear regression analysis, eight equations were generated to correct the relative body fat obtained with equations commonly used in Brazil. For these correction equations, R 2 was between 0. 830 and 0. 961 and p-value was 0. 000 for all measurements. Conclusion These results indicate the use of equations for the correction of estimated values of relative body fat measured with the WCS <b>Dual</b> <b>Hand</b> skinfold caliper, whenever the Lange skinfold caliper is not available, {{in order to minimize}} the difference between them...|$|E

We first describe a 3 -D face tracking technique based on real-time parametric motion-stereo, which is non-invasive, robust, and self-initialized. The tracker provides a real-time estimate of a "frontal face ray" whose intersection with the display surface plane {{is used as}} a second stream of input for scrolling or pointing, in parallel with hand input. We evaluated the performance of combined head/hand input on a box selection and coloring task: users selected boxes with one pointer and colors with a second pointer, or performed both tasks with a single pointer. We found that performance with head and one hand was intermediate between single hand performance and <b>dual</b> <b>hand</b> performance.

40|$|Abstract — The {{great number}} of {{possible}} tasks that can be performed by a robotic manipulator has inspired the development of many different kinematic control strategies in the literature. These classic strategies often use minimal representations for the end-effector pose, leading to representation singularities. Alternatively, in strategies that use non-minimal representations, as homogeneous transformation matrices, it is usually difficult or counterintuitive to extract suitable parameters {{in order to control}} the robot. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>dual</b> quaternions are a suitable representation to unify pose representation and control techniques, and hence this work reviews the design of singularity-robust and task-priority kinematic manipulator controllers and adapts these designs to the unit dual quaternion space.

We conducted a user-elicitation study to explore what interactions are more natural and intuitive for dual-hand controllers for manipulating 3 D objects in these environments. The {{results of the study}} suggest that for dual-hand devices users prefer interactions that are based on shoulder motions (e.g., shoulder abduction, shoulder horizontal abduction) and elbow flexion movements. In addition, users seem to prefer one-hand interaction, and when two hands are required they prefer interaction that do not require simultaneous hand or arm movements for precise interactions. Our research is limited to one type of dual-hand controller (based on the HTC Vive). Despite this, our results are applicable to similar <b>dual</b> <b>hand</b> devices, like the Oculus Touch and PlayStation Move. In the future we plan to explore design issues of these dual-hand controllers {{to see if we can}} increase users’ preference and ability to use two hands to interact with 3 D objects in virtual environments.|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} practice of transradial approach (TRA). BackgroundTRA has been adopted as an alternative access site for coronary procedures. MethodsA questionnaire was distributed worldwide with Internet-based software. ResultsThe survey was conducted from August 2009 to January 2010 among 1, 107 interventional cardiologists in 75 countries. Although pre-TRA <b>dual</b> <b>hand</b> circulation testing is not uniform in the world, > 85 % in the U. S. perform Allen or oximetry testing. Right radial artery is used in almost 90 %. Judkins catheters are the most popular for left coronary artery angiographies (66. 5 %) and right coronary artery angiographies (58. 8 %). For percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), 6 -F is now standard. For PCI of left coronary artery, operators use standard extra back-up guiding catheters in > 65 % and, for right coronary artery 70. 4 % use right Judkins catheters. Although heparin remains the routine antithrombotic agent in the world, bivalirudin is frequently used in the U. S. for PCI. The incidence of radial artery occlusion before hospital discharge is not assessed in > 50 %. Overall, approximately 50 % responded that their TRA practice will increase in the future (68. 4 % in the U. S.). ConclusionsTRA is already widely used across the world. Diagnostic and guiding-catheters used for TRA remain similar to those used for traditional femoral approach, suggesting that specialized radial catheters are not frequently used. However, there is substantial variation in practice as it relates to specific aspects of TRA, suggesting that more data are needed to determine the optimal strategy to facilitate TRA and optimize radial artery patency after catheterization...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} a simplified prevention bundle with alcohol-based, <b>dual</b> <b>hand</b> hygiene (HH) audit on the incidence of early-onset ventilation-associated pneumonia (VAP). This 3 -year, quasi-experimental study with interrupted time-series analysis was conducted in two cardiovascular surgery intensive care units in a medical center. Unaware external HH audit (eHH) performed by non-unit-based observers was a routine task before and after bundle implementation. Based on the realistic ICU settings, we implemented a 3 -component bundle, which included: a compulsory education program, a knowing internal HH audit (iHH) performed by unit-based observers, and a standardized oral care (OC) protocol with 0. 1 % chlorhexidine gluconate. The study periods comprised 4 phases: 12 -month pre-implementation phase 1 (eHH+/education-/iHH-/OC-), 3 -month run-in phase 2 (eHH+/education+/iHH+/OC+), 15 -month implementation phase 3 (eHH+/education+/iHH+/OC+), and 6 -month post-implementation phase 4 (eHH+/education-/iHH+/OC-). A total of 2553 ventilator-days were observed. VAP incidences (events/ 1000 ventilator days) in phase 1 - 4 were 39. 1, 40. 5, 15. 9, and 20. 4, respectively. VAP was significantly reduced by 59 % in phase 3 (vs. phase 1, incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0. 41, P = 0. 002), but rebounded in phase 4. Moreover, VAP incidence was inversely correlated to compliance of OC (r 2 = 0. 531, P = 0. 001) and eHH (r 2 = 0. 878, P < 0. 001), but not applied for iHH, despite iHH compliance was higher than eHH compliance during phase 2 to 4. Compared to eHH, iHH provided more efficient and faster improvements for standard HH practice. The minimal compliances required for significant VAP reduction were 85 % and 75 % for OC and eHH (both P < 0. 05, IRR 0. 28 and 0. 42, respectively). This simplified prevention bundle effectively reduces early-onset VAP incidence. An unaware HH compliance correlates with VAP incidence. A knowing HH audit provides better improvement in HH practice. Accordingly, we suggest dual HH audit and consistent bundle performance does matter in quality-of-care VAP prevention...|$|E

30|$|In {{terms of}} using the two {{hand-held}} devices together, {{it would appear that}} for most tasks participants were able to do the tasks with one of the devices. In addition, participants commented that the two devices were identical and sometimes was difficult to tell them apart and because of this it was not easy to think in terms {{of using the}} two together. In terms of its design, participants said that it would have been more cognitively easier if the two devices had a different feeling, tactile wise or in terms of its shape, something akin to the Nintendo Wii Remote and the Nunchuk combination. Despite the form factor, participants were observed using two devices for coordinated tasks, such as Task 16, which was primarily based on elbow flexion/internal rotation. We asked participants if they would want to use two hands more often. They said that they prefer not to because it is not easy to coordinate two hands moving together, especially when they were wearing the VR HMD. This was rather surprising. They said that if they had to use two hands, they would not mind doing so but they would rather use one hand. If they had to use two hands, a number of participants suggested it would be preferable if the two hands were going in the same direction or doing the same activity—for example, both hands doing elbow flexion. In addition, they said that they would find it difficult if two hands were doing things simultaneously. They further said that it would be better if interactions requiring two hands to have asynchronous actions, with one hand doing one action first, and afterward the other hand can perform a follow up action. This is in line with research about <b>dual</b> <b>hand</b> interaction techniques [20, 25, 26, 48, 49]. For example, for text entry activities, when using two hands at the same time, it can lead to faster performance, but it can also decrease their accuracy [26, 48]. In addition, when performing two-handed simultaneous marking menu strokes, it has been reported that the participants had the slowest reaction time because of the extra cognitive burden in “remembering and planning their strokes when coordinating simultaneous motions of two hands” [42; p. 16.14].|$|E
40|$|Dexterous robot hands offer a {{wide variety}} of {{grasping}} and interaction possibilities with objects. In order to select the best grasp, it is critical to count with a reliable grasp quality measure. Traditional grasp analysis methods use quality measures that allow a relative comparison of grasps for the same object, without an associated physical meaning for the resulting quality. The focus of this thesis is to establish an improved grasp analysis method that will result in a quality measure that can be directly interpreted in the force domain. One of the most commonly used grasp qualities is the largest minimum resisted wrench, which indicates the maximum perturbation wrench that a grasp can resist in any direction. Two efficient ways to calculate this quality are identified: (i) incremental grasp wrench space algorithm, and (ii) ray shooting algorithm. However, existing algorithms for such methods make several assumptions to avoid computational complexities in analyzing the 6 D wrench space of a grasp. Important properties like hand actuation, realizable contact forces, friction at the contacts, and geometry of the object to be grasped are either neglected or greatly simplified. In this thesis, these assumptions are improved to bring those algorithms closer to reality. In the case of bimanual grasps, the number of contacts significantly increases, which in turn increases the computational complexity of the process. Suitable algorithms to handle a higher number of contacts are also proposed in this thesis. For grasping an object successfully, considering the hand and the object for analysis are necessary but not sufficient requirements. The capabilities of the robotic arm to which the hand is attached are equally important. Different manipulability measures are considered for the arm, corresponding to single and <b>dual</b> <b>hand</b> grasps, and they are later unified with the physically relevant grasp quality to obtain an overall measure of the goodness of a particular grasp. Based on the updated grasp quality, a complete grasp planning architecture is established. It also includes methods for bimanual grasp synthesis and grasp filtering based on properties like collision with the environment and arm reachability. The thesis includes application examples that illustrate the applicability of the approach. Finally, the developed algorithms can be generalized to a different type of force interaction task, namely a humanoid robot balancing with multiple contacts with the environment. A customized ray shooting algorithm is used to find the stability region of a humanoid legged robot standing on an uneven terrain or making multiple contacts with its hands and legs. In contrast to the regular zero-moment point based method, the stability region is found by analyzing the wrench space of the robot, which makes the method independent of the number of contacts or the contact configuration. Different examples show the direct and intuitive interpretation of the results obtained with the proposed method...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{advent of}} new {{satellite}} signals with Galileo L 1 /E 5 and modernized GPS L 5 {{is expected to}} significantly improve navigation performance {{both in terms of}} accuracy and integrity monitoring.

Jayo Bandara was also a chivalrous youth of noble birth, whom the king regarded as the son he never had. Outraged by the notion of losing his love, Veediya Bandara went on to challenge Jayo Bandara to a <b>dual</b> for her <b>hand.</b> Although an accomplished fighter himself, Jayo Bandara {{was no match for}} the brute strength and the skill of Veediya Bandara. The dual ended up in the defeat and death of Jayo Bandara and it wasn't long before Veediya Bandara realizing the enormity of his actions and fled Kotte. Without both the princes the royal army was leaderless and with the threat of his brother Mayadunne looming, king Bhuvanekabahu had no option but to pardon Veediya Bandara, appoint him {{as the leader of the}} army and wed him to his daughter.|$|R
5000|$|Austria was {{far behind}} the lines of belligerent Germany and the {{reaction}} of Austrian civilians on the Moscow Declaration was <b>dual.</b> On one <b>hand,</b> people made a false conclusion that the status of [...] "the first victim" [...] will help Austria to avoid allied bombings. On the other hand, [...] "Moscow" [...] in the title was unmistakably associated not with western allies, but with uncompromising Bolshevism. People, in whole, were indifferent to the news and did not support any anti-Hitler opposition groups. During 1943-1944 the number of arrests increased, but 80% of arrested were foreign workers, whose number was 140 thousand in Vienna alone. During 1944, as military and economical landscape has been getting worse, dissatisfaction has been increasing among Austrians too, but not with Hitler regime, but with the stream of refugees, especially Protestants, [...] "from the North". Home-level conflicts did not undermine the fighting spirit of the nation. Quite the contrary, success of the Allies and reactivation of air bombings of Austria only consolidated its population around the figure of Fuerer. During the unsuccessful 20 July plot people of Vienna fully supported Hitler.|$|R
