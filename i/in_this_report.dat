5|$|The {{most recent}} report in 2009 {{contained}} data for 34 schools in 15 districts during the 2007-2008 school year. The average school performance score for schools in that report was 52.9, compared to 86.3 statewide. The average classroom instructional expenditure per student was $6,416 among these schools, compared to $5,924 statewide. About 91 {{percent of students}} <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>report</b> were in poverty, compared to 63.2 percent statewide. The schools <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>report</b> had higher teacher turnover than the statewide average and a slightly higher percentage of uncertified teachers than the state average.|$|E

Their analysis reaffirmed that O.emmonsae was a distinct species {{and found that it}} was closest to O.macconnelli and O.russatus, differing from both by about 12% in the cytochrome b sequence; O.nitidus was more distantly related, differing by 14.7%. The average sequence difference between the three O.emmonsae studied was 0.8%.|$|E
5|$|Traffic is {{regularly}} counted and reported by Autocesta Zagreb–Macelj, the operator of the motorway, and {{is published by}} Hrvatske Ceste. As the motorway traffic volume is measured through an analysis of toll ticket sales, the southernmost section of the motorway, Jankomir - Zaprešić, is not included <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>report,</b> as it is not tolled. However, since the section {{is a part of}} Zagreb bypass, it is considered to carry heavier traffic than any other section of the A2 motorway. In 2006, it carried more than 22,000 vehicles per day, and its traffic volume grew considerably since the completion of the motorway in 2007.|$|E

25|$|A 2011 {{report of}} the Pew Forum on Religious and Public Life {{estimated}} that members of Presbyterian or Reformed churches make up 7% of the estimated 801 million Protestants globally, or approximately 56 million people.

50|$|<b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>reporting</b> period, the Government {{restricted}} {{the quantity of}} Christian literature in the Uzbek language that registered central religious organizations could import into the country. Authorities also confiscated Christian literature in Uzbek that had been legally imported into the country. In previous reporting periods, government authorities told church leaders that all Christian literature in Uzbek is considered contraband, {{even if it was}} legally imported. For historical and cultural reasons, evangelical pastors generally preach in Russian while offering limited services in the Uzbek language--the official national language and the one linked most closely to the majority Muslim population. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>reporting</b> period, the CRA allowed some materials, such as limited quantities of Uzbek translations of some books of the Bible.
