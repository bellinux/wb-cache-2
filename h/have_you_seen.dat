2500|$|According to Alex Buchan, Abernethy's biographer, in the 19th century Royal Naval {{officers}} were almost always from the landed gentry {{and they had}} purchased their commissions. Certain of their superiority, they wrote accounts of their expeditions keeping the credit for themselves. Indeed, {{at the end of}} an expedition, commanders often required any records kept by the crew to be given to them for inclusion at their discretion in the official report. Possibly because of this Abernethy left no written records. According to Sir Joseph Hooker, a distinguished scientist, concerning crewmen, [...] "And where <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> or heard that their services are in the least appreciated? The Admiralty have not as much as sent a letter of thanks to the men".|$|E
2500|$|The Water Babies, a {{fairy tale}} for a land baby by Charles Kingsley (serialised in Macmillan's Magazine 1862–63, {{published}} in book form, with additions, in 1863). Kingsley had been among first to give a favourable review to Darwin's On the Origin of Species, having [...] "long since... learnt to disbelieve the dogma of the permanence of species", and the story includes a satire on the reaction to Darwin's theory, with the main scientific participants appearing, including Richard Owen and Huxley. In 1892 Thomas Henry Huxley's five-year-old grandson Julian saw the illustration by Edward Linley Sambourne (right) and wrote his grandfather a letter asking: Dear Grandpater– <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> a Waterbaby? Did {{you put it in}} a bottle? Did it wonder if it could get out? Could I see it some day?– Your loving Julian. Huxley wrote back: My dear Julian– I could never make sure about that Water Baby... My friend who wrote the story of the Water Baby was a very kind man and very clever. Perhaps he thought I could see as much in the water as he did– There are some people who see a great deal and some who see very little in the same things.When you grow up I dare say you {{will be one of the}} great-deal seers, and see things more wonderful than the Water Babies where other folks can see nothing.|$|E
