[...] These can be stand-alone vehicles, or may be modular, such as {{with the use of}} a hook-lift system. Hooklifts are sometimes only employed for seldom-used equipment; they can load a variety of different equipment containers very rapidly and act as a special unit with lower investment costs. For example, the Helsinki Rescue Department has several <b>hooklift</b> trucks and more than 40 containers, including a water container, a hose container, and an oil destruction container. Containers may also carry a command post, salvage tools, foam barrels, hoses, [...] special pumps for wildfires, and field hospitals.|$|E

50|$|PALFINGER {{considers}} {{itself the}} global market leader for loader cranes, timber and recycling cranes, marine cranes, wind cranes, <b>hooklifts</b> and railway systems. The acquisition of the globally operating Harding Group in 2016 also made PALFINGER the world’s market leader in maritime lifesaving equipment. Moreover, the Company is a leading specialist in tail lifts and truck mounted forklifts. PALFINGER is committed to providing the best service in the industry.|$|R

5000|$|The single lift/dump {{cylinder}} design reduces unit cost, retains true <b>hooklift</b> capabilities, {{but can be}} unstable while dumping on uneven ground.|$|E
5000|$|Container lengths {{are fairly}} inflexible, as <b>hooklift</b> hoists are {{designed}} to carry bodies within 3 to 5 ft of the shortest recommended body ...|$|E
50|$|Lift {{and dump}} {{capacities}} of hydraulic <b>hooklift</b> hoists typically range from 8000 to 68000 lb. Generally a hoist {{is capable of}} lifting (off the ground) and dumping (onto the ground) the same maximum capacity, although there can be exceptions where short wheel bases are involved.|$|E
50|$|Hydraulic <b>hooklift</b> hoists {{are mounted}} on heavy duty trucks to enable hauliers to change out flatbeds, {{dumpster}} bodies, and similar containers. Primarily {{used in conjunction}} with tilt frame bodies and specialised containers, generally designed for the transportation of materials in the waste, recycling, scrap and demolition industries.|$|E
5000|$|According to Marrel {{they have}} invented <b>hooklift</b> trucks {{marketing}} them since 1969 in the USA. There have been various heights and sizes of the hook with the ACTS roller container system standardizing on 1,570 mm (rounded to 61.75 {{in for the}} US market at Stellar Industries). Hook heights of 54" [...] and 36" [...] are also in common use.|$|E
5000|$|The {{hydraulic}} {{operating pressure}} of all <b>hooklift</b> hoists are preset {{at the factory}} to achieve the intended lifting capacity for the design application. The original approach used by early European models, still widely used today, was a high pressure / low volume system. This setup suits chassis with space restraints, allowing for use of a smaller piston pump and a smaller hydraulic reservoir. Such systems operate between [...]|$|E
50|$|In 1986, Scammell {{tendered}} for the British Army <b>hooklift</b> DROPS tender, {{using the}} newly developed 8x6 {{variant of the}} S24. This was equipped with a Rolls-Royce 350 engine, ZF automatic gearbox and Kirkstall axles. However, shortly after winning the contract to supply 1522 such vehicles, Leyland group was bought by DAF of the Netherlands. DAF elected to build the S26 DROPS at the Leyland plant in Lancashire, and close the Watford factory.|$|E
5000|$|The {{ratio of}} {{container}} length to chassis length {{is a factor}} in achieving rated load capacity. This ratio determines the load angle, and all <b>hooklift</b> hoist systems indicate a recommended range of body lengths, typically 3 - 5 ft difference in length between the container and the chassis. Container bodies shorter than the recommended length produce substantially steeper load angles, and consequently lower load rating, than those of the longest bodies intended for use with a particular hoist.|$|E
50|$|In the US the Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT) was {{produced}} in a version with a <b>hooklift</b> hoist gear named Load Handling System (LHS). The M1120 HEMTT LHS {{is the basis of}} the Palletized Load System using a flatbed platform to be mounted under ISO containers as a Container Handling Unit (CHU). This allows containers to be unloaded without the help of a forklift. Current NATO agreements require PLS to maintain interoperability with comparable British, German and French systems {{through the use of a}} common flatrack.|$|E

5000|$|There is an {{additional}} term [...] "hooklift container" [...] that {{is related to the}} common designation of the hoist gear on trucks used for roller containers to be called [...] "hook lift". This has influenced languages like Dutch where the truck is called haakarmvoertuig (hook arm vehicle) and the container being a haakarmbak (hook arm pod). These terms refer to the level arm that matches with the grip hook on the container to lift it from the ground. Note that the term <b>hooklift</b> container may refer to any container type with {{an additional}} hook bar which does not necessarily include roller wheels - this includes the NATO standard STANAG 2413 variations of 20' ISO containers having an additional hook bar.|$|E
50|$|The Multilift MPH (Military Pivoting <b>Hooklift)</b> {{range is}} based around commercially proven technologies, the overall system {{performance}} being improved by enhancing below ground {{pick up and}} the ability to load misaligned flatracks, both important military operational requirements. The complete system is designed to be used in all operational conditions, including darkness or while wearing nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) protective equipment. An automatic, fully sequenced control system mounted in the cab aids operational safety and maximises speed, even under battle conditions. The MPH range was designed and optimised to load, transport and unload flatracks conforming to the NATO standard (STANAG 2413). Flatracks can be pre-loaded at base with any military payload ready for dispersal to the required location. Payloads such as MLRS rockets, light armoured vehicles and command/control shelters can also be transported by using purpose-built flatracks with the correct locking systems built in.|$|E
40|$|Keywords:hooklift；multi-objective optimization；genetic algorithm；{{structure}} design Abstract. Based on {{the theory}} of FEM, the <b>hooklift</b> arm is modeled with the FEM software, {{and the structure of}} the device is optimized with genetic algorithm in a multi-objective/multi-parameter optimization environment, which results in an optimal design decision of the <b>hooklift</b> arm device under the engineering constraint. Comparison between optimized design decision and original design decision shows that the optimization is correct and the proposed multi-objective/multi-parameter optimization method is effective in improving the <b>hooklift</b> arm device...|$|E
