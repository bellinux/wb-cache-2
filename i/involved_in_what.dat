5|$|In September 1979, Khalqist President Nur Muhammad Taraki {{was assassinated}} in a coup within the PDPA orchestrated by fellow Khalq member Hafizullah Amin, who assumed the presidency. Distrusted by the Soviets, Amin was assassinated by Soviet special forces in December 1979. A Soviet-organized government, led by Parcham's Babrak Karmal but {{inclusive}} of both factions, filled the vacuum. Soviet troops were deployed to stabilize Afghanistan under Karmal in more substantial numbers, although the Soviet government {{did not expect to}} do most of the fighting in Afghanistan.

5|$|To assist at {{practice}} for the 1927 season, Krichell signed Billy Werber from Duke University. He left the team after a month, but re-signed after graduating in 1930. During that time, Krichell was <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>what</b> {{is considered one of}} the worst deals from the era. Barrow asked him to travel to Durham, North Carolina to negotiate with the Durham Bulls for an outfielder named Dusty Cooke. Neither Krichell nor Barrow had seen Cooke; he was believed to be a great hitter, even though he had hardly played for the Bulls. The Yankees signed him for $15,000 ($ in 2010), beating the Cleveland Indians' offer of $12,500 ($ in 2010) and an unnamed player in exchange. Cooke turned out to be an injury-prone backup outfielder, and the Yankees gave up on both Cooke and Werber. After the 1933 season, the two were traded to the Boston Red Sox for cash considerations.|$|E

5|$|In early April the {{battalion}} {{was moved to}} Alexandria and from there on to Lemnos Island. On the morning of 25 April 1915, {{the battalion}} {{took part in the}} Landing at Anzac Cove, coming ashore as part of the second wave. Over the course of the first week the battalion was involved in establishing the beachhead and suffered heavily, losing five officers and 179 men killed or died of wounds. This was higher than any other subsequent battle that the battalion fought during the war. On 29 April, the 2nd Brigade was relieved by the 12th (Deal) Battalion and in early May the battalion was able to reorganise itself after its baptism of fire. The respite did not last long, however, for only ten days after the landing at Anzac Cove, the 2nd Brigade was transferred to Cape Helles in order to take part in an attack on Krithia on 8 May 1915. The attack was a very costly failure, with the battalion losing a further six officers and 87 men killed. Nevertheless, they were <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>what</b> {{is believed to be the}} first brigade-level attack conducted by an Australian force against an entrenched enemy and the attack earned the Victorians many plaudits.|$|E

No. 860 Lord Hawke was derailed at , Hampshire on 14 August 1940 due to enemy action. a bomb fell on the track ahead of the train, which was unable to stop in time. No. 852 received a direct hit from an enemy bomb on 18 April 1941, and was so severely damaged that it was not returned to service until June 1942. No. 854 suffered a firebox failure due to lack of water 23 April 1945, killing the fireman and injuring the driver. No. 851 Sir Walter Raleigh was involved in a serious derailment at Byfleet in December 1946, due to the poor condition of the permanent way. On 26 November 1947, No. 860 Lord Hawke was hauling a passenger train that was run into by another at , Hampshire due to a signalman's error. Two people were killed.

25|$|The Jin dynasty (265–420) briefly unified the Chinese empire, in 280, {{but from}} 291 to 306 a multi-sided civil war {{known as the}} War of the Eight Princes raged through {{northern}} China, devastating {{that part of the}} country. For the first thirteen years this was a deadly violent and all-out struggle for power among at least eight princes and various dukes of Jin. Then in 304 CE the leader of the formerly independent ethnic nation of the Northern Xiongnu under its newly declared Grand Chanyu Liu Yuan (later Prince Han Zhao) declared independence, backed up with a large army which he fielded. Various other non-Chinese groups became <b>involved,</b> <b>in</b> <b>what</b> is known as the Wu Hu uprising, and by 316 the last Jin prince left standing, now as emperor, ruled an empire reduced to its former southern area. Thus, the history of the Jin dynasty can be divided in two parts, the first being Western Jin (265–316) and the second Eastern Jin (317–420).|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{cardinals}} {{were the}} clergy serving parishes {{of the city}} of Rome under its bishop, the pope. The College acquired particular importance following the crowning of Henry IV as King of Germany and Holy Roman Emperor at the age of six, after the unexpected death of Henry III in 1056. Until then, the Holy See was often bitterly fought for among Rome's aristocratic families and external secular authorities had significant influence over who was to be appointed pope, and the Holy Roman Emperor in particular had the special power to appoint him. This was significant as the aims and views of the Holy Roman Emperor and the Church did not always coincide. Churchmen <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>what</b> has become known as the Gregorian Reform took advantage of the new king's lack of power and in 1059 reserved the election of the pope to the clergy of the Church in Rome. This {{was part of a larger}} power struggle, which became known as the Investiture Controversy, as the Church and the Emperor each attempted to gain more control over the appointment of bishops, and in doing so wield more influence in the lands and governments they were appointed to. Reserving to the cardinals the election of the pope represented a significant shift in the balance of power in the Early Medieval world. From the beginning of the 12th century, the College of Cardinals started to meet as such, when the cardinal bishops, cardinal priests and cardinal deacons ceased acting as separate groups.|$|E
25|$|In May, Nadeau was <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>what</b> was {{regarded}} {{at the time}} {{as one of the most}} serious accidents in NASCAR history. While practicing for the race at Richmond International Raceway, Nadeau lost control of the No. 01 while trying to avoid another car in turn one and slammed into the wall driver side first. This was before the advent of SAFER barriers being installed at racetracks to dissipate the force from racing accidents, resulting in Nadeau impacting the unprotected concrete wall. He suffered fractures to his skull and several of his ribs along with a collapsed lung and temporary paralysis on his left side, and the cumulative effects would lead to his retirement as a driver. Busch Series veteran Jason Keller replaced Nadeau at the Richmond race finishing 32nd, and the team used several temporary substitutes for the rest of the year. Mike Wallace ran the next four races, then four more races afterwards (skipping Sonoma) with a best finish of 19th at Dover. Mike Skinner ran 11 races with the team after being released from Morgan McClure Motorsports, earning a pole at Richmond. Boris Said ran both road course races, also earning a pole as well as a sixth-place finish (both at Sonoma). Finally, the team signed Joe Nemechek, who had been released from Hendrick Motorsports' 25 car (where he had replaced Nadeau), to permanently drive the No. 01 car, running the last four races of the year and earning a top 10 at Atlanta. Said and Skinner earned spots in the 2004 Budweiser Shootout for their respective pole runs, with Boris in the 01 finishing 10th, and Skinner finishing 15th in the 10 Valvoline car.|$|E
