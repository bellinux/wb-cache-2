The first chapter proposes a structural-equilibrium model to examine some economic implications arising from voluntary filing of Chapter 11.

50|$|A free desktop {{version of}} the {{software}} is also available by download for Apple and Windows desktop and laptop computers. Similar to the online version, it converts YouTube and other video files into an audio format, with several <b>file</b> <b>options.</b> However it immediately saves files into a computer destination folder of the user's choice. The tools for this application are customizable within the settings and are supported across Windows (XP SP3 and later) and Apple macOS (Mac OS X 10.7 Lion and later) operating systems. It is also capable of downloading audio files from YouTube, and other flash video players, and converting them into several formats, with an MP3 format as the default option. It offers the same <b>file</b> format <b>options</b> as the online version. After download, files are saved {{under the name of}} the original video title. Another feature of the software is the ability to convert entire video playlists at once. These entire playlists are then saved into the same destination folder the same as other audio files. The desktop version has an estimated 780,000 downloads.|$|R

50|$|If {{one is not}} {{eligible}} for IRS Free File, it might cost hundreds of dollars to file electronically, whereas paper filing has no costs beyond those of printing and mailing. Furthermore, the available existing electronic <b>filing</b> <b>options</b> may not offer sufficient flexibility with respect to arranging one's tax return, adding attachments, or putting written notes of explanation that can help preempt IRS questions. In addition, electronic filing makes one's tax return {{more likely to be}} audited because it is already in a format accessible to the IRS, whereas of paper returns, only 40% are transcribed, so that the remaining are not even in the running for being audited. For these reasons, law resource NOLO as well as Forbes argue that the more complicated one's tax return, the better it is to file on paper. Filing electronically also exposes the taxpayer's data to the risk of accidental loss or identity theft.|$|R

40|$|The {{original}} SIMION was an {{electrostatic lens}} analysis and design program developed by D. C. McGilvery at Latrobe University, Bundoora Victoria, Australia, 1977. SIMION for the PC, {{developed at the}} Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, shares little more than its name with the original McGilvery version. INEL`s fifth major SIMION release, version 6. 0, represents a quantum improvement over previous versions. This C based program can model complex problems using an ion optics workbench that can hold up to 200 2 D and/or 3 D electrostatic/magnetic potential arrays. Arrays can have up to 10, 000, 000 points. SIMION 3 D`s 32 bit virtual Graphics User Interface provides a highly interactive advanced user environment. All potential arrays are visualized as 3 D objects that the user can cut away to inspect ion trajectories and potential energy surfaces.
