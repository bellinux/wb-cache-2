40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} different tabletops {{with or without a}} <b>knee</b> <b>support</b> on the position of the rectum, prostate, and bulb of the penis; and to {{evaluate the}} effect of these patient-positioning devices on treatment planning. METHODS AND MATERIALS: For 10 male volunteers, five MRI scans were made in four different positions: on a flat tabletop with <b>knee</b> <b>support,</b> on a flat tabletop without <b>knee</b> <b>support,</b> on a rounded tabletop with <b>knee</b> <b>support,</b> and on a rounded tabletop without <b>knee</b> <b>support.</b> The fifth scan was in the same position as the first. With image registration, the position differences of the rectum, prostate, and bulb of the penis were measured at several points in a sagittal plane through the central axis of the prostate. A planning target volume was generated from the delineated prostates with a margin of 10 mm in three dimensions. A three-field treatment plan with a prescribed dose of 78 Gy to the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements point was automatically generated from each planning target volume. Dose-volume histograms were calculated for all rectal walls. RESULTS: The shape of the tabletop did not affect the rectum and prostate position. Addition of a <b>knee</b> <b>support</b> shifted the anterior and posterior rectal walls dorsally. For the anterior rectal wall, the maximum dorsal shift was 9. 9 mm (standard error of the mean [SEM] 1. 7 mm) {{at the top of the}} prostate. For the posterior rectal wall, the maximum dorsal shift was 10. 2 mm (SEM 1. 5 mm) at the middle of the prostate. Therefore, the rectal filling was pushed caudally when a <b>knee</b> <b>support</b> was added. The <b>knee</b> <b>support</b> caused a rotation of the prostate around the left-right axis at the apex (i. e., a dorsal rotation) by 5. 6 degrees (SEM 0. 8 degrees) and shifts in the caudal and dorsal directions of 2. 6 mm (SEM 0. 4 cm) and 1. 4 mm (SEM 0. 6 mm), respectively. The position of the bulb of the penis was not influenced by the use of a <b>knee</b> <b>support</b> or rounded tabletop. The volume of the rectal wall receiving the same dose range (e. g., 40 - 75 Gy) was reduced by 3. 5 % (SEM 0. 9 %) when a <b>knee</b> <b>support</b> was added. No significant differences were observed between the first and fifth scan (flat tabletop with <b>knee</b> <b>support)</b> for all measured points, thereby excluding time trends. CONCLUSIONS: The rectum and prostate were significantly shifted dorsally by the use of a <b>knee</b> <b>support.</b> The rectum shifted more than the prostate, resulting in a dose benefit compared with irradiation without <b>knee</b> <b>support.</b> The shape of the tabletop did not influence the rectum or prostate positio...|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to explore {{the changes in the}} low back biomechanical responses during a harvesting task as a function of different harvesting techniques/postures and to explore the effects of an ergonomic intervention designed to reduce the low back stress during this work activity. Nine participants performed a series of simulated harvesting activities in a laboratory setting using four different harvesting techniques: full kneeling posture, squatting posture, stooping posture and kneeling on a <b>knee</b> <b>support</b> device (the intervention). As they performed these tasks the activity of muscles of the torso and thighs was captured using electromyography and trunk kinematics were captured using the lumbar motion monitor and a magnetic field-based motion tracking system. The results showed that (1) three postures – <b>knee</b> <b>support,</b> squatting, and stooping – required high flexion of low back (more than 60 °) and (2) squatting and stooping postures showed significantly higher passive tissue moment compared with two kneeling postures. The results also indicate that the beneficial aspects of the <b>knee</b> <b>support</b> intervention appear to be outweighed by reduced productivity and the high degree of trunk flexion and that the current strategy used by these workers of alternating between the various harvesting postures may be the best strategy available...|$|E

To encourage active participation of the user, the use of admittance control strategy {{is one of the most}} appropriate approaches, which requires methods for online adjustment of impedance components. Such approach is cited by the literature as a challenge to guaranteeing a suitable dynamic performance. This work proposes a method for online knee impedance modulation, which generates variable gains through the gait cycle according to the users’ anthropometric data and gait sub-phases recognized with footswitch signals. This approach was evaluated in an active knee orthosis with three variable gain patterns to obtain a suitable condition to implement a stance controller: two different gain patterns to support the knee in stance phase, and a third pattern for gait without <b>knee</b> <b>support.</b> The knee angle and torque were measured during the experimental protocol to compare both temporospatial parameters and kinematics data with other studies of gait with knee exoskeletons. The users rated scores related to their satisfaction with both the device and controller through QUEST questionnaires. Experimental results showed that the admittance controller proposed here offered <b>knee</b> <b>support</b> in 50 % of the gait cycle, and the walking speed was not significantly different between the three gain patterns (p = 0. 067). A positive effect of the controller on users regarding safety during gait was found with a score of 4 in a scale of 5. Therefore, the approach demonstrates good performance to adjust impedance components providing <b>knee</b> <b>support</b> in stance phase...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Knee {{supports}} {{are often}} employed to decrease adductor angle and/or adductor moment and thus medial knee joint loading in persons with medial knee osteoarthritis. It is compelling that these gait alterations {{would also be}} considered beneficial in healthy individuals from a prophylactic application. While the Opedix product was designed specifically as a <b>knee</b> <b>support</b> system, {{in the present study}} lower extremity kinematic chain with emphasis on hip and knee were investigated. PURPOSE: The {{purpose of this study was}} to test Opedix garments and describe the changes in sagittal (X), frontal (Y), and transverse (Z) planes for both kinematic and kinetic data at the ankle, knee, and hip during walking and jogging. METHODS: Fifteen healthy subjects between the ages of 18 - 28 (20 Â± 1. 3) performed ten walking and ten jogging trials with (W) and without (WO) the <b>knee</b> <b>support</b> garment system. Subjects walked at a self-selected pace, which was then controlled by step length demarcations along the collection runway and was kept constant for all trials. Ankle, knee, and hip angles, joint reaction forces, joint reaction force integrals, and joint moment were all calculated in the sagittal (X), frontal (Y), and transverse (Z) planes of motion. Forces were displayed in 2 fashions, peak forces and force integrals - making this a novel study. Changes in these dependent variables were assessed while wearing and without wearing the garment in walking and jogging, independently utilizing paired t-tests. RESULTS: While walking the following decrease occurred from without the garment to with the garment: Hip Angle-Z decreased 31. 6 %, Hip Force-X decreased 19. 3 %, Hip Force-Y decreased 34. 4 %, Hip-X moment decreased 13. 7 %, and Hip-Y moment decreased 15. 4 %. While jogging, the following decrease occurred from without the garment to with the garment: Hip Angle-X decreased 6. 5 %, Hip Angle-Y decreased 15. 7 %, Hip Angle-Z decreased 42. 3 %, Hip Force-X decreased 27. 6 %, Hip Force-Z decreased 3. 6 %, and Hip Moment-X was decreased 28. 3 %. CONCLUSIONS: The garment had some kinematic and kinetic effect on joints tested, but consistencies did not exist at each plane.

40|$|Background: Traditionally, the {{anatomical}} knee joint {{is locked in}} extension when walking with a conventional knee-ankle-foot orthosis. A powered knee-ankle-foot orthosis was developed to provide restriction of knee flexion during stance phase and active flexion and extension of the knee during swing phase of gait. Objective: The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine differences of the powered knee-ankle-foot orthosis compared to a locked knee-ankle-foot orthosis in kinematic data and temporospatial parameters during ambulation. Study design: Quasi-experimental design. Methods: Subjects with poliomyelitis (n = 7) volunteered for this study and undertook gait analysis with both the powered and the conventional knee-ankle-foot orthoses. Three trials per orthosis were collected while each subject walked along a 6 -m walkway using a calibrated six-camera three-dimensional video-based motion analysis system. Results: Walking with the powered knee-ankle-foot orthosis resulted in a significant reduction in both walking speed and step length (both 18 %), but a significant increase in stance phase percentage compared to walking with the conventional knee-ankle-foot orthosis. Cadence was not significantly different between the two test conditions (p = 0. 751). There was significantly higher knee flexion during swing phase and increased hip hiking when using the powered orthosis. Conclusion: The new powered orthosis permitted improved knee joint kinematic for knee-ankle-foot orthosis users while providing <b>knee</b> <b>support</b> in stance and active knee motion in swing in the gait cycle. Therefore, the new powered orthosis provided more natural knee flexion during swing for orthosis users compared to the locked knee-ankle-foot orthosis...|$|E
40|$|Various gloveboxes (GBXs) {{have been}} used aboard the Shuttle and ISS. Though the overall {{technical}} specifications are similar, each GBX's crew interface is unique. JSC {{conducted a series of}} ergonomic evaluations of the various glovebox designs to identify human factors requirements for new designs to provide operator commonality across different designs. We conducted 2 0 g evaluations aboard the Shuttle to evaluate the material sciences GBX and the General Purpose Workstation (GPWS), and a KC- 135 evaluation to compare combinations of arm hole interfaces and foot restraints (flexible arm holes were better than rigid ports for repetitive fine manipulation tasks). Posture analysis revealed that the smallest and tallest subjects assumed similar postures at all four configurations, suggesting that problematic postures are not necessarily a function of the operator s height but a function of the task characteristics. There was concern that the subjects were using the restrictive nature of the GBX s cuffs as an upper-body restraint to achieve such high forces, which might lead to neck/shoulder discomfort. EMG data revealed more consistent muscle performance at the GBX; the variability in the EMG profiles observed at the GPWS was attributed to the subjects attempts to provide more stabilization for themselves in the loose, flexible gauntlets. Tests revealed that the GBX should be designed for a 95 percentile American male to accommodate a neutral working posture.

30|$|Spirometric {{measurements}} {{taken when}} standing {{were compared to}} four sitting positions (Figure  1). These were; a) sitting in an upright chair with a horizontal seat, {{feet on the floor}} and with the trunk at 90 ° to the thighs [here referred to as “sit flat”], b) sitting with the trunk vertical on a seat that sloped downwards so that the angle between the trunk and thighs was 115 ° [“slope down”], c) sitting on a horizontal seat with the back reclining so that the angle between the thighs and the trunk was 122 ° [“slope back”] and d) sitting with trunk vertical and the thighs sloping upwards to make an angle of 65 ° with the trunk [“slope up”]. Ergonomic chairs with kneeling or saddle designs require a trunk to thigh angle of 110 °– 125 ° (Bettany-Saltikov et al. 2008; Gandavadi and Ramsay 2005). These have a pommel or <b>knee</b> <b>support</b> to prevent the sitter slipping off. We chose 115 ° for “sit slope” as the steepest angle that could comfortably be maintained without slipping. Positions c) and d) were extreme positions in which the biomechanics of breathing should be considerably altered. The liver (weight around 1.5  kg in the adult male) is attached to the underside of the diaphragm and gravity contributes to its descent during inhalation. In more supine positions such as “slope back”, this effect is reduced (Hoit 1995). The angle used is also said to minimise intervertebral disk pressure and postural muscle activity (Harrison et al. 1999). Reducing the angle between the trunk and thighs to 65 ° (“slope up”) would be expected to restrict anterior abdominal wall expansion and restrict the descent of the diaphragm. The subjects were 30 undergraduate students (13 males, 17 females of Caucasian origin) from the Royal Welsh College of Music (RWCMD) and Drama and Cardiff University, age 20.7 [*]±[*] 1.0  yrs (mean[*]±[*]s.d.), mean BMI 23.3 [*]±[*] 3.6.

Each participant underwent 3 trials, with 3 attempts in each trial to elicit hamstring stretch reflex. Furthermore, to determine the onset and magnitude of the tibial translation, a control experiment was performed with six participants using a high-speed 3 D motion analysis system (Vicon MX Nexus system, Vicon Motion Systems Limited, Oxford Metrics Ltd., Oxford, UK). Retro-reflective markers were fixed to the skin using double-sided adhesive tape over the lateral femoral epicondyle, 3  cm above the lateral femoral epicondyle, 3  cm below the lateral tibial epicondyle and on the apex of the patellae.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} kinematic changes that occur during an actual marathon. We hypothesized that (1) certain running kinematic measures would change between kilometres 8 and 40 (miles 5 and 25) of a marathon and (2) fast runners would demonstrate smaller changes than slow runners. Subjects (n = 179) were selected according to finish time (Range = 2 : 20 : 47 to 5 : 30 : 10). Two high-speed cameras were used to measure sagittal-plane kinematics at kilometres 8 and 40 of the marathon. The dependent variables were stride length, contact time, peak <b>knee</b> flexion during <b>support</b> and swing, and peak hip flexion and extension during swing. Two-tailed paired t-tests were used to compare dependent variables between kilometres 8 and 40 for all subjects, and regression analyses were used to determine whether faster runners exhibited smaller changes (between miles 5 and 25) than slower runners. For all runners, every dependent variable changed significantly between kilometres 8 and 40 (p < 0. 001). Stride length increased 1. 3 %, contact time increased 13. 1 %, peak <b>knee</b> flexion during <b>support</b> decreased 3. 2 %, and peak hip extension, knee flexion, and hip flexion during swing decreased 27. 9 %, increased 4. 3 %, and increased 7. 4 %, respectively (p < 0. 001). Among these significant changes, all runners generally changed the same from kilometres 8 and 40 except that fast runners decreased peak <b>knee</b> flexion during <b>support</b> less than the slow runners (p < 0. 002). We believe that these changes, for all runners (fast and slow), were due to fatigue.
