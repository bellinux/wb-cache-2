500|$|The {{proposed}} excavation {{was announced}} in the June 2012 issue of the Richard III Society's magazine, the Ricardian Bulletin, but a month later {{one of the main}} sponsors pulled out leaving a £10,000 funding shortfall; an appeal resulted in members of the several Ricardian groups donating £13,000 in two weeks. A press conference held in Leicester on 24 August announced the start of the work. Archaeologist Richard Buckley admitted the project was a long shot: [...] "We don't <b>know</b> <b>precisely</b> where the church is, let alone where the burial site is." [...] He had earlier told Langley that he thought the odds were [...] "fifty-fifty at best for [...] the church, and nine-to-one against finding the grave." ...|$|E
500|$|Equipment at Inmarsat's Perth {{ground station}} had been {{upgraded}} in 2013 with additional storage capacity and new software to record an expanded data set for transmissions, including {{the addition of}} Burst Frequency Offset (BFO) and Burst Timing Offset (BTO) values. Without {{the addition of the}} BFO and BTO values, {{it would not have been}} possible to determine the aircraft's distance from the satellite at each handshake and hence significantly narrow the search region. The expanded data values were prompted by Inmarsat's involvement in the search for Air France Flight447, which disappeared over the Atlantic Ocean in 2009. The company felt the additional data values could be useful in future incidents. According to Inmarsat's vice-president of satellite operations, Mark Dickinson, the company [...] "did not <b>know</b> <b>precisely</b> how [...] might be useful but [...] had a hunch and decided to [...]" ...|$|E

500|$|Several {{commentators}} {{hypothesized that}} allegations of rape against Bill Cosby, which surfaced {{at the same}} time as the publication of [...] "A Rape on Campus", would be less damaging to the comedian as a result of the seeming collapse of the Rolling Stone story. [...] When Camille Cosby spoke about the rape allegations against her husband Bill, she said: [...] "We all followed the story of the article in the Rolling Stone concerning allegations of rape at the University of Virginia. The story was heart-breaking, but ultimately appears to be proved untrue. Many in the media were quick to link that story to stories about my husband– until that story unwound." [...] Writing for Bloomberg, Zara Kessler observed that, [...] "suddenly, every Cosby accuser is a potential 'Jackie'—although we don't yet <b>know</b> <b>precisely</b> what it means to be a 'Jackie.' How honest are the intentions of Cosby's accusers?" ...|$|E
500|$|Most critics' praise went to Robin Williams' {{performance}} as Genie, with Janet Maslin of The New York Times declaring that children [...] "needn't <b>know</b> <b>precisely</b> what Mr. Williams is evoking {{to understand how}} funny he is." [...] Warner Bros. Cartoons director Chuck Jones even called the film [...] "the funniest feature ever made." [...] Furthermore, English-Irish comedian Spike Milligan considered {{it to be the}} greatest film of all time. James Berardinelli gave it 3.5 out of 4 stars, praising the [...] "crisp visuals and wonderful song-and-dance numbers." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said the comedy made the film accessible to both children and adults, a vision shared with Desson Howe of The Washington Post, who also said [...] "kids are still going to be entranced by the magic and adventure." [...] Brian Lowry of Variety praised the cast of characters, describing the expressive magic carpet as [...] "its most remarkable accomplishment" [...] and considered that [...] "Aladdin overcomes most story flaws thanks to sheer technical virtuosity." ...|$|E
500|$|The loss of {{life during}} the 1985 {{eruption}} was due partly {{to the fact that}} scientists did not <b>know</b> <b>precisely</b> when the eruption would occur, and the authorities would not take costly preventative measures without clear warnings of imminent danger. Because the volcano's last substantial eruption occurred 140 years ago, it was also hard for many to accept the danger the volcano presented; locals even called it the [...] "Sleeping Lion". Hazard maps showing Armero would be completely flooded after an eruption were distributed more than a month before the eruption, but the Colombian Congress criticized the scientific and civil defense agencies for scaremongering. Local authorities failed to alert people to the seriousness of the situation, with Armero's mayor and a priest both reassuring the populace after an ash eruption on the afternoon of November 13 and the consequent ashfall early that evening. Another factor was the storm that hit that evening, causing electrical outages and hindering communications. Civil defense officials from four nearby towns tried to warn Armero the lahar was approaching in the hour or so before it reached Armero, but failed to make radio contact.|$|E

2500|$|Only two {{children}} {{and none of the}} women died, probably because their cabin was farther from the blast than the hurricane deck where most of the male passengers were gathered. Newspapers did not name Vann's slave crewmen. Thirty-six passengers and twenty crew members were identified as killed in the explosion, and forty-eight passengers and seven crew members who survived, with a total of 111 persons aboard. The pilot, Captain Thompson, estimated that there were at least 130 travellers, including deck passengers, and a thirty-man crew when the Lucy Walker left Louisville. [...] Since the vessel's passenger manifests and crew lists were lost, {{there is no way to}} <b>know</b> <b>precisely</b> how many died.|$|E
2500|$|We do not <b>know</b> <b>precisely</b> who {{designed}} the Taj Mahal today. In the Islamic world at the time, the credit for a building's design was usually given to its patron rather than its architects. From the evidence of contemporary sources, {{it is clear that}} a team of architects were responsible for the design and supervision of the works, but they are mentioned infrequently. Shah Jahan's court histories emphasise his personal involvement in the construction and it is true that, more than any other Mughal emperor, he showed the greatest interest in building, holding daily meetings with his architects and supervisors. The court chronicler Lahouri, writes that Jahan would make [...] "appropriate alterations to whatever the skilful architects designed after many thoughts, and asked competent questions." [...] Two architects are mentioned by name, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri and Mir Abd-ul Karim in writings by Lahauri's son Lutfullah Muhandis. Ustad Ahmad Lahauri had laid the foundations of the Red Fort at Delhi. Mir Abd-ul Karim had been the favourite architect of the previous emperor Jahangir and is mentioned as a supervisor, together with Makramat Khan, of the construction of the Taj Mahal.|$|E

2500|$|Speaking in San Francisco to the California Commonwealth Club of California on March 27, 2008, Mukasey defended President Bush's {{program of}} {{wiretapping}} calls between Americans and suspected foreign terrorists without court authorization, and {{implied that the}} government {{might have been able}} to prevent the attacks of September 11, 2001, if it had been able to wiretap a specific call to the U.S. from Afghanistan. Before September 11, 2001, Mukasey said, [...] "We knew that there had been a call from someplace that was known to be a safe house in Afghanistan, and we knew that it came to the United States. We didn't <b>know</b> <b>precisely</b> where it went." [...] He paused, seemed to stifle tears or at least suppress emotion, then continued, [...] "You've got 3,000 people who went to work that day, and didn't come home, to show for that." [...] In a subsequent letter to Mukasey, House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers questioned whether any such phone call had ever actually occurred and, if so, why the government hadn't been able to use its then-existing legal authority and technological capabilities to monitor it.|$|E
