He accepted and began work there in 1919.|$|E
5|$|In the 2010s, Russia's economy {{suffered}} from a financial crisis, depressed oil prices, and international sanctions put into place during the Ukrainian crisis. With less disposable income to spend, citizens were <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> drastic measures. In 2017, for instance, {{approximately half of the}} country's population was growing fruits and vegetables to supplement their diet, caused in part by a doubling in food prices in the preceding two years.|$|E
5|$|On Monday morning, {{the storm}} had moved {{northeast}} of London, Ontario, dragging lake effect blizzards in its wake. An additional 17inches (43cm) of snow were dumped on Cleveland, Ohio that day, filling the streets with snowdrifts 6feet (2m) high. Streetcar operators stayed with their stranded, powerless vehicles for two nights, eating whatever food was provided by local residents. Travelers were <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> shelter and wait for things to clear.|$|E

5|$|Although Minton {{supported}} the Roosevelt Administration {{and became a}} regular guest at the White House, Minton opposed the president on some measures. He voted to override a presidential veto of a grant of $2.5 ($ billion in 2015 dollars) in bonus pay for World War I soldiers (Bonus Army). He {{supported the}} Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill, which Roosevelt feared would cost the party support in the southern states. He also supported {{an extension of the}} Hatch Act of 1939, a law that prevented federal employees from being <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> part in state election campaigns, effectively lessening the influence of federal patronage.|$|E
5|$|As dusk {{began to}} fall on the drying track, the No. 8 Peugeot {{suffered}} from rear wheel hub failures which required two lengthy visits to the garage. This allowed the No. 1 Audi to take over second place. Jacques Villeneuve's No. 7 Peugeot also lost time, which dropped it to two laps behind the No. 2 Audi. The No. 1 Audi had its own brief moment when the No. 63 Corvette clipped the Audi's rear end. The Corvette was <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> evasive action through the Dunlop Chicane's gravel trap, and the Audi required replacement rear bodywork on its next pit stop.|$|E
5|$|Del Potro {{started his}} 2010 {{season at the}} AAMI Kooyong Classic in Melbourne, Australia with a win over Croatian world No. 24 Ivan Ljubičić.

He was {{scheduled}} to face Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga on day 2 of the Kooyong Classic exhibition tournament, but withdrew due to a wrist injury. He came into the 2010 Australian Open with the injury not healed, and was <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a month off after the event.

5|$|Despite having aided Togashi Masachika in {{his return}} to power, within a year the Ikkō-ikki of Kaga fell into {{conflict}} with him. Claiming that he failed to adequately deliver on his promises of economic reward, the Ikkō-ikki of Kaga revolted in 1474. Rennyo refused to support these rebellions, and the Ikkō-ikki were quickly defeated and <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> refuge in neighboring Etchū. Shimotsuma Rensu, a ji-samurai from Echizen and an advisor to Rennyo, led another revolt, falsely claiming that Rennyo authorized his actions. This revolt also failed, and Rennyo excommunicated Rensu.|$|E
5|$|He {{has never}} been charged with any crime due to {{apparent}} mental inculpability. One contentious issue of Weston's incarceration is that of forced medication. Weston has thus far refused to take any medications voluntarily. His lawyers helped enable this, {{in order to protect}} him from the death penalty. In May 2001, a federal judge authorized doctors to treat Weston involuntarily. A panel from a federal appeals court ruled in July 2001 that Weston could be <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the drugs which he was forced to do for 120 days. He remains in the Butner facility indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s the Soviet {{authorities}} {{began the}} widespread use of psychiatric treatment as a form of punishment and deterrence for the independent-minded. This involved unlimited detention in a psikhushka, as such places were popularly known, which might be conventional psychiatric hospitals or psychiatric prison-hospitals set up (e.g. the Leningrad Special Psychiatricl Hospital) as part of an existing penal institution. Healthy individuals were held among mentally ill and often dangerous patients; they were <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> various psychotropic drugs; they might also be incarcerated in prison-type institutions under overall control of the KGB.|$|E

5|$|Khmer Krom or Southern Khmer {{is spoken}} by the {{indigenous}} Khmer {{population of the}} Mekong Delta, formerly controlled by the Khmer Empire but part of Vietnam since 1698. Khmers are persecuted by the Vietnamese government for using their native language and, since the 1950s, have been <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Vietnamese names. Consequently, very {{little research has been}} published regarding this dialect. It has been generally influenced by Vietnamese for three centuries and accordingly displays a pronounced accent, tendency toward monosyllablic words and lexical differences from Standard Khmer.|$|E
5|$|On taking office, Welensky was <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{sides in}} the Suez Crisis. The {{government}} of the United Kingdom received heavy international criticism for its actions, but Welensky's government, with those of Australia and New Zealand, nonetheless stood behind Britain. It was Welensky's first experience in international politics. In {{the aftermath of the}} Suez debacle British colonial policy changed significantly, which would have adverse effects for the federation. It marked the decline of a gradual approach to decolonisation, and a rapid speeding up of the process. Politically, only three years after its founding, the federation began to decline.|$|E
