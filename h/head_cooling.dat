2500|$|First run in 1937, the R-2800 was the United States's first 18-cylinder {{radial engine}} design. The Double Wasp was more {{powerful}} than the world's only other modern eighteen, the Gnome-Rhône 18L of 3,442in³ (56.4L). (The American Wright Duplex-Cyclone radial of 3,347in³ (54.86L) was also under development at the time, and promised to be {{more powerful than}} either the P or Gnome-Rhone radials.) The Double Wasp was much smaller in displacement than either of the other 18-cylinder designs, and heat dissipation was a greater problem. To enable more efficient cooling, the usual practice of casting or forging the cylinder <b>head</b> <b>cooling</b> fins that had been effective enough for other engine designs was discarded, and instead, much thinner and closer-pitched cooling fins were machined from the solid metal of the head forging. The fins were all cut at the same time by a gang of milling saws, automatically guided as it fed across the head {{in such a way that}} the bottom of the grooves rose and fell to make the roots of the fins follow the contour of the head, with the elaborate process substantially increasing the surface area of the fins. [...] The twin distributors on the Double Wasp were prominently mounted on the upper surface of the forward gear reduction housing and almost always prominently visible within a cowling, with the conduits for the spark plug wires emerging from the distributors' cases either directly forward or directly behind them, or on the later C-series R-2800s with the two-piece gear reduction housings, on the [...] "outboard" [...] sides of the distributor casings.|$|E

Through the years the trucks were upgraded to LD 465-1c engines, with 60Amp alternator instead of the 25Amp generator. With {{the addition of a}} turbocharger, the engine evolved into the LDT 465-1c (turbo clean air). The turbo was added more to clean up the black exhaust on the Non Turbo engines, than to add power; the HP was raised from 130 to only 135 HP. Turbo models used: 3LD305 (early engines only) and 3LJ319 (the [...] "whistler") The LDT-465-1D was the last version of the Multi Fuel, it had the same 3LJ319 Turbo (whistler), or the quieter 3LM39 (non-whistler), better head gasket sealing and <b>head</b> <b>cooling.</b>|$|E
50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{non-invasive}} <b>head</b> <b>cooling</b> caps and helmets designed to target cooling at the brain. A hypothermia cap is typically made of a synthetic material such as neoprene, silicone, or polyurethane and filled with a cooling agent such as ice or gel which is either cooled to a very cold temperature, -25 to -30 C, before application or continuously cooled by an auxiliary control unit. Their most notable uses are in preventing or reducing alopecia in chemotherapy, and for preventing cerebral palsy in babies born with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. In the continuously cooled iteration, coolant is cooled {{with the aid of a}} compressor and pumped through the cooling cap. Circulation is regulated by means of valves and temperature sensors in the cap. If the temperature deviates or if other errors are detected, an alarm system is activated. The frozen iteration involves continuous application of caps filled with Crylon gel cooled to -30 C to the scalp before, during and after intravenous chemotherapy. As the caps warm on the head, multiple cooled caps must be kept on hand and applied every 20 to 30 minutes.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the effects of <b>head</b> <b>cooling</b> during endurance cycling on performance and the serotonergic neuroendocrine response to exercise in the heat. Subjects exercised at 75 % VO^sub 2 max^ to volitional fatigue on a cycle ergometer at an ambient temperature of 29 ± 1. 0 °C, with a relative humidity of approximately 50 %. <b>Head</b> <b>cooling</b> resulted in a 51 % (p< 0. 01) improvement in exercise time to fatigue and Borg Scale ratings of perceived exertion were significantly lower throughout the exercise period with cooling (p< 0. 01). There were no indications of peripheral mechanisms of fatigue either with, or without, <b>head</b> <b>cooling,</b> indicating the importance of central mechanisms. Exercise in the heat caused the release of prolactin {{in response to the}} rise in rectal temperature. <b>Head</b> <b>cooling</b> largely abolished the prolactin response while having no effect on rectal temperature. Tympanic temperature and sinus skin temperature were reduced by <b>head</b> <b>cooling</b> and remained low throughout the exercise. It is suggested that there is a coordinated response to exercise involving thermoregulation, neuroendocrine secretion and behavioural adaptations that may originate in the hypothalamus or associated areas of the brain. Our results are consistent with the effects of <b>head</b> <b>cooling</b> being mediated by both direct cooling of the brain and modified cerebral artery blood flow, but an action of peripheral thermoreceptors cannot be excluded...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} selective <b>head</b> <b>cooling</b> with mild systemic hypothermia in hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) in newborn infants. Study design Infants with HIE {{were randomly assigned to}} the selective <b>head</b> <b>cooling</b> or control group. Selective <b>head</b> <b>cooling</b> was initiated within 6 hours after birth to a nasopharyngeal temperature of 34 degrees +/- 0. 2 degrees C and rectal temperature of 34. 5 degrees to 35. 0 degrees C for 72 hours. Rectal temperature was maintained at 36. 0 degrees to 37. 5 degrees C in the control group. Neurodevelopmental outcome was assessed at 18 months of age. The primary outcome was a combined end point of death and severe disability. Results One hundred ninety-four infants were available for analysis (100 and 94 infants in the selective <b>head</b> <b>cooling</b> and control group, respectively). For the selective <b>head</b> <b>cooling</b> and control groups, respectively, the combined outcome of death and severe disability was 31 % and 49 % (OR: 0. 47; 95 % CI: 0. 26 - 0. 84; P =. 01), the mortality rate was 20 % and 29 % (OR: 0. 62; 95 % CI: 0. 32 - 1. 20; P =. 16), and the severe disability rate was 14 % (11 / 80) and 28 % (19 / 67) (OR: 0. 40; 95 % CI: 0. 17 - 0. 92; P =. 01). Conclusions Selective <b>head</b> <b>cooling</b> combined with mild systemic hypothermia for 72 hours may significantly decrease the combined outcome of severe disability and death, as well as severe disability.
