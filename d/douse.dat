5|$|The game's 15 {{missions}} {{take place}} in large levels that can be confronted in multiple ways. Guards may be knocked out with a blackjack or killed with a bow or sword, and their fallen bodies may be picked up and hidden. In addition to human enemies, the game features security automatons and surveillance cameras. While completing objectives such as frameups and blackmail, the player steals valuables {{that may be used}} to purchase thieving gear between missions. The player's main tools are specialized arrows, including water arrows to <b>douse</b> lights, moss arrows to dampen the player character's footsteps and rope arrows to reach higher ground.|$|E
5|$|Between 1899 and 1902, four Manchester {{ships and}} their crews were requisitioned by the United Kingdom {{government}} to transport troops, horses, and supplies to South Africa during the Boer War and its aftermath. Collecting points for horses and mules included Galveston and New Orleans (USA) and Buenos Aires and Montevideo in South America. Manchester Port made its second voyage to the Cape in 1900, then continued to Australia to bring {{troops to the}} conflict. On the first voyage after her return to ML, in January 1903, the first Manchester Merchant was lost while on passage from New Orleans to Manchester. A serious fire developed in her cotton cargo, and she was scuttled in Dingle Bay {{on the west coast}} of Ireland to <b>douse</b> the flames, but subsequently broke up in bad weather.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dousing</b> is the {{practice}} of making something or someone wet by throwing liquid over them, e.g., by pouring water, generally cold, over oneself. A related practice is ice swimming. Some consider cold water <b>dousing</b> to {{be a form of}} asceticism.|$|R
5|$|During gunnery {{training}} on 5 May, {{there was a}} premature detonation in the left gun of Hyūgas Turret No. 5 that disabled both guns and killed 51 crewmen. Both aft magazines were flooded to <b>douse</b> the resulting fire and save the ship. She received temporary repairs during which the turret was removed and replaced by a circular armour plate on which three triple 25mm gun mounts were positioned. On 11 May a valve in Ises No. 2 engine room stuck {{in the open position}} and flooded the engine room. While under repair at Kure, both ships received prototype Type 21 radars. Commanded by Vice-Admiral Shirō Takasu, the 2nd Battleship Division set sail with the Aleutian Support Group on 28 May, {{at the same time that}} most of the Imperial Fleet began an attack on Midway Island (Operation MI).|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 6November 1995, a fire {{broke out in the}} Rova compound, {{destroying}} or severely damaging all of its buildings. Once the flames had been extinguished, all that remained of the original structures were the stone shells of the royal chapel and Manjakamiadana. Fire-fighters arrived late at the scene. Their capacity to <b>douse</b> the fire was hampered by the discovery that their fire hoses did not properly fit onto the nearby hydrants. In addition, the water pressure at the hydrants was significantly reduced due to Analamanga hilltop's high elevation. As the fire-fighters battled the flames, numerous bystanders ran into Rova compound buildings to retrieve artefacts of historic and cultural significance. Approximately 1,675 objects were saved out of an estimated total of 6,700. Some pillaging is believed to have occurred. On {{the night of}} the fire, the body of one of the queens was found in the public square in the centre of the city. A funeral vigil was held the following day for these royal remains. The remains were later identified as belonging to Ranavalona III, and have since been re-interred in the royal tombs at Ambohimanga.|$|E

50|$|Although, the Solemnity of the Nativity of St. John the Baptist was {{traditionally}} not {{celebrated with}} water <b>dousing,</b> sometime in 2000, the LGU launched the Sinabligay Festival, which translates as Water <b>Dousing</b> Festival.

25|$|Officials in {{neighbouring}} countries accused Indonesian {{officials of}} doing {{nothing to stop}} the fires, though forestry ministry {{officials said they had}} firefighters working to <b>douse</b> the blazes on state-controlled land. However, they conceded, most of the fires were on private land. Indonesia planned to deploy its military to aid fire fighting effort. To recruit more people to man the fire line, the government offered two days off for civil servants who volunteered for fire duty. But the country lacked equipment for fighting forest fires, having aeroplanes that were too small to carry enough water to <b>douse</b> the fires. In a bid to obtain bigger aircraft, the government leased two Beriev Be-200 aircraft from Russia, which are capable of skimming over water and taking on loads for sustained firefighting efforts. The planes, which will be flown by Russians and maintained by Russian technicians, were due to begin operations on 1 November.|$|E
25|$|In 234, Sun Quan {{personally}} led a 100,000-strong army {{to attack}} Xincheng, Hefei.

Sun Quan's nephew, Sun Tai, was killed in the battle. Sun Quan withdrew his forces.|$|E

25|$|A severe fall {{during a}} visit to Montreal in 1951 forced Klemperer {{subsequently}} to conduct seated in a chair. A severe burning accident further paralyzed him, which resulted from his smoking in bed and trying to <b>douse</b> the flames with the contents of a bottle of spirits of camphor nearby. Through Klemperer's problems with his health, the tireless and unwavering support and assistance of Klemperer's daughter Lotte was crucial to his success.|$|E
25|$|The island's {{resources}} for handling emergencies {{have recently been}} supplemented with a multi-purpose emergency vehicle {{which can be used}} as a police car, an ambulance and also a water trailer for a fire engine. The island has a regular firefighting unit, a duty which used to be performed by the monks. The last reported major fire on the island was in 1940 when the monastery was damaged. In December 2012, six firefighters had to be brought by boat from Tenby to <b>douse</b> a small fire.|$|E
25|$|In some species, {{differences}} in form {{between the sexes}} is quite marked. For example, in the African species Agrius convolvuli (the convolvulus or morning glory hawk moth), the antennae are thicker and wing markings more mottled in the male than in the female. Only males have both an undivided frenular hook and a retinaculum. Also, all male hawk moths have a partial comb of hairs along their antennae. Females call males to them with pheromones. The male may <b>douse</b> the female with a pheromone before mating.|$|E

25|$|One of five {{problems}} can prevent a fire from lighting properly: wet wood, wet weather, too little tinder, too much wind, or {{a lack of}} oxygen. Rain will <b>douse</b> a fire, but a combination of wind and fog also has a stifling effect. Metal fire rings generally {{do a good job of}} keeping out wind, but some of them are so high as to impede the circulation of oxygen in a small fire. To make matters worse, these tall fire rings also make it very difficult to blow on the fire properly.|$|E
25|$|As {{the fire}} raged outside the mine, the heat caused {{the cold air}} in the tunnel to rush out, {{replacing}} it with hot air and smoke. Pulaski ordered the men to {{lie down on the}} floor of the mine where there was still some breathable air. As the fire closed in around the tunnel entrance, timber beams at the mouth of the tunnel began to burn. Pulaski carried water in his hat from pools on the mine floor to the entrance, trying to <b>douse</b> the flames. In the process, he was badly burned. Eventually, Pulaski fell unconscious, as did all his men.|$|E

Upon reaching Bottom's Bridge over the Chickahominy, they found it had also been damaged and rested there for the night while it was repaired. By this time, Sheridan's men were suffering from hunger and it was becoming urgent that they reach Union lines. On May 14, he led his men to Haxall's Landing on the James River, ending his raid.|$|E

500|$|As a {{reflection}} of Balzac himself, Lambert also embodies the author's self-image as a brilliant writer, but one who acknowledges suspicions about his mental health. Some of his stories and public statements – {{as well as his}} fall prior to writing the novel – had led some observers to question Balzac's sanity. The protagonist's madness in Louis Lambert only added weight to these claims. As biographer Graham Robb writes: [...] "It was typical of Balzac to <b>douse</b> a fire with petrol." ...|$|E
