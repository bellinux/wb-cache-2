It has also been suggested that the youth is a depiction of Perseus holding the head of the slain Gorgon.|$|E

These codes are famous because they have many illuminations of Apocalypse and book of Daniel that {{accompany}} the text. This thesis aims to understand if these written sources may have been the transmission medium of <b>iconographic</b> <b>models</b> between the different cultures that lived in the Iberian Peninsula after 711. In order to achieve this goal it was created a catalogue with all the manuscripts preserved until today. On the one hand, the catalogue makes available a part dedicated to a codicological description. On the other hand, it provides a comprehensive iconographic analysis. The catalogue shows that in these codes are used recurring iconographic elements. Especially, the illuminations reproduce the real architecture; thus, the reader can find references to what he/she knows. In addition to architecture, these references concern the use of Kufic script as decoration in the same style of Muslim. Moreover, the illuminations depict the people sitting in the Muslim manner. This sheds light on how actually there was a mutual exchange between the cultures that lived in the Iberian Peninsula. Therefore, these written sources should have really been the transmission medium of <b>iconographic</b> <b>models.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|If Picasso's Guernica (1937) {{marks the}} {{beginning}} of the dark period of Franco's dictatorship in Spain, the theater play Mori el Merma by Joan Miró and the Putxinel·lis Claca troupe stands for the end of fascism in that country. The performance of this play coincides with the proclamation of the democratic constitution in 1978. Together with Picasso, and with the same humanistic spirit, Miró had created his monumental fresco El Segador for the Spanish pavilion at the Paris World Fair (1937). If this work has since disappeared, the battle of the painter for human rights did not come to an end with it. The <b>iconographic</b> <b>model</b> of both the Segador and Merma was Ubu roi by the French artist Alfred Jarry (1873 - 1907). With this dramatic (and pictorial) work he anticipated the archetype of the "small" bourgeois who finds himself in a position of absolute politic power. Jarry's monstrous marionette inspired many 20 th c. artists, and Miró used this character in many drawings and lithographies as well.

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a history of}} the motive Kairos in Greco-Roman literature and art from the time when Lysippus created his famous statue in the 4 th century up to the transformation of the allegorical male subject into the feminine image Occasio. This is an extremely complex matter, as we do not yet know all the characteristics of Lisippus’ work or the details of the <b>iconographic</b> <b>model</b> he had created. Based on both literary and iconographic material, this analysis focuses mainly on the epigram that Ausonius dedicated to Occasio (epigr. 12 Green), its ties to the Greek epigrammatic tradition (Posidipp. APl 275) and the re-elaboration of the motive by the Romans (above all, Phaedr. 5, 8). From this analysis we see how Phaedrus’ bold attempt to introduce the static image of Kairos into the conflictual action of the fable influences Ausonius’ original rewriting of Posidippus’ text. Indeed, Ausonius’ epigram shares the strong moral import of Phaedrus’ apologue, its descriptive dynamism and the resolution in action that involves the spectator-reader. Finally, our findings allow us to conjecture that the image of Occasio and Paenitentia described by Ausonius is essentially the fruit of an elaborate literary remake. This would leave little room for the supposition of an ekphrasis founded on the autopsy of a work that really existed (even if the influence of freely associated iconographic suggestions aiming at an original poetic creation cannot be excluded). Nonetheless, it was precisely this ‘autopsy’ of Ausonius’ ekphrasis that was to inspire – in a sort of circular continuum between art and literature – a late 15 th-century fresco of the school of Mantegna in Mantua. The article ends with an examination of further documentation concerning the fortune of the new Ausonian paradigm in the iconography and literature of the 15 th and 16 th centuries...|$|E

The same applied to the capitals of columns, never more exciting than in this period, when they were often carved with complete scenes with several figures.

These two pillars would be at the origin of the theology of the divine twins, one of whom is mortal (related to the NE pillar, as confining with the region where the sun does not shine) and the other is immortal (related to the SE pillar and the region where the sun always shines).

Furthermore, the <b>iconographic</b> <b>models</b> of the Virgin Mary and the Mountain are of great interest for the history of engraving and of the Catalan and Spanish devotions.

40|$|Maddalena Vaccaro {{will focus}} on archival {{documents}} about the ivory diptych from San Tommaso in Acquanegra, now preserved in the collections of the Museo Nazionale del Bargello in Florence, aiming to ‘virtually’ re-connect the piece to its context of provenance. In fact, the diptych, figured with scenes from Christ’s life, was shown on St. Peter’s altar {{till the end of}} 19 th century and is a rare proof of the liturgical decor of the church. Through documentation, she will reconstruct as the ivory was moved from Acquanegra to Florence. In fact, firstly the diptych was removed from the altar due to theft attempts, and then put on sell since 1882, after the parish priest requested its artistic evaluation to the Ministero di Antichità e Belle Arti. The Ministery, who initially challenged its trade, then imposed the sell to a National Museum. Thus, the analysis investigates the correspondence between the Parish, the Ministery, the Commissariato alle Antichità e Belle Arti della Toscana and the Museo Nazionale in Florence in order to clarify the actions managed for the conservation of the piece, but also the awareness of the artistic value of the diptych. Benedetta Chiesi will consider the artistic aspect and iconography of the Acquanegra ivory, quite unknown in the scientific literature on Gothic ivories. Indeed, the diptych had not been studied since it appeared in the catalogue of Raymond Koechlin in 1924. This text aims at investigating the ivory in connection with a group of closely comparable works, to confirm its chronology and origins. The iconography and composition, with eight scenes from the Christ’s Life and Passion, read from left to right beginning at the bottom, allows comparisons with the so-called Large Passion diptych group and especially the group of diptychs with colonnettes. These <b>iconographic</b> <b>models</b> were employed by a number of Parisian ateliers {{in the second half of}} the 14 th century, and spread largely in France until the end of the century. The study of this diptych in connection with the documentation concerning its context of provenance allows to note the misinterpretation of one of the scenes in the Passion cycle (the Arrest), willing to see in it san Tommaso, the patron of the church of Acquanegra. This text, in complex, aims at highlighting the overall artistic aspect of the diptych and to strengthen the relation with its historical provenance, which is to be considered as an extremely important factor due to its infrequency in the studies on Gothic ivories...|$|R

Dopunjava se broj inače u literaturi poznatih ikona te prvi put objavljuju dvije prethodno neobrađene: ikona s prikazom Bogorodice Strasne, 17. stoljeće, karakteristični ikonografski tip prikazivanja Bogorodice s Kristom u kretskom ikonopisu i ikona s prikazom Deizisa iz 17. stoljeća, a po prvi puta se prikazuje dosad samo spomenuto Raspelo, također iz 17. stoljeća. K tome, predlažu se ispravljanja prijašnjih datacija ostalih šest ikona i posebno daju dosad nepostojeće identifikacije na pojedinim ikonama prikazanih svetaca. Uz podrobnije ikonografske interpretacije protumačena su značenja i sadržajno složenijih ikona te istaknuta puna homogenost zbirke kao cjeline donesene s Krete tijekom Kandijskog rata. There are 14 icons in the {{collection}} of the Confraternity of All Saints in Korčula. So far the public has been aware of the Virgin Eleusa with a female donor, and the »Large« and Small« Crucifix. The other icons have been just briefly mentioned in one review on the occasion of the presentation of {{the collection}}. Here we publish for the first time two icons from the collection, the Virgin Passionate and Deisis. The first one is interesting for its iconography. One of the most typical <b>iconographic</b> <b>models</b> of the Cretan painting is here presented in a rather unique way. By combining elements of a Hodigitria and an Eleusa the artist has achieved an effect of pain and suffering, typical for the Virgin Passionate, in particular by placing a crown of thorns upon the child’s head. Dating of this icon to the 17 th ct. is helped by a sense of beauty and the soft painterly technique, as well as presence of certain Baroque details. The Deisis reveals anachronistic iconography with subtle western influences. For these reasons, and for a relatively low level of quality, this icon is dated to the middle of the 17 th ct. We also deal with a 17 th ct. crucifix, which so far has been only casually mentioned. It represents a late repetition of an old iconographic theme typical of early Cretan painting clearly showing strong Gothic influences. The work is mediocre, but its rarity makes it interesting. Next we correct some earlier datings of the icon of St. George on horseback killing a dragon. It used to be dated to the 17 th ct. but we move it an entire century forward as it displays classical Cretan iconography from the early phase of Cretan painting, incompatible with the 17 th ct., when elements of the Baroque start to be clearly felt. The icons with Holy Warriors were also dated to the second half of the 16 th ct. but on the basis of their stylistic characteristics we propose to date them to the beginning of the century. The same is the case with the icon showing a male and a female saint which we identify as St. Nicholas and St. Paraskeva, and thus also explain their meaning. Theological learning and iconographic complexity is also revealed by the icon with three saints – St. Dyonisios, St. Eleutherios and St. Onophrios. We have explained it as a symbolic representation of three saintly categories – holy monks, holy bishops, and holy ascetics. In the end, by a correct identification of so far incorrectly identified figure on the icon showing St. Anne with the Virgin and Christ along with two saints we have succeeded in explaining its meaning. Instead of St. Joachim next to the central group flanked on the other side by St. John the Baptist, there is St. Athanasios of Alexandria. By such identification supported also by a partly preserved inscription we have explained the icon as a complex and indirect representation of the Holy Trinity. We have concluded that the collection is very valuable and representative, and that its coming into being should, correctly, be linked with the participation of forces from Korčula in the Candian war, and their withdrawal. Thus the hypothesis of the Cretan origin of the Virgin Eleusa with a female donor appears very probable and justifiable. Finally, it would seem that the choice of paintings in terms of their artistic quality and iconographic program was deliberate and made by a well informed person, and not accidental...|$|R
40|$|At {{the end of}} the 19 th cent. P. Orsi {{acquired}} for the Archaeological Museum of Syracuse a {{group of}} architectural terracottas said to come from Agrigentum, San Biagio area (on the SE slope of the Rupe Atenea). This lot, left quite unnoticed until now, consists of six antefixes of late 5 th-early 3 rd cent. B. C. Tarantine types with relief heads of Gorgo-Medusa, Pan, and Artemis Bendis, that can confirm the circulation of these products, known otherwhere in Sicily by a few specimens from Gela excavations and from surface finds. But the most noteworthy piece is a fragmentary clay sima with a lion head spout, dated around 280 - 70 B. C., that is particularly interesting both for the technique and for the subject of its decoration, depicting in low relief two ephebic Erotes hunting a she-bear in a rocky landscape. On one hand, it allows us to investigate how <b>iconographic</b> schemes and <b>models</b> could be disseminated by means of drawings or sketches, and/or casts or moulds, or some kind of “aides-mémoire”, in graphic or plastic form, and reassembled in new ways by toreuts, potters and coroplasts. As a matter of fact, some compositional devices of the cynegetic scene echo late 4 th cent. B. C. pictorial models (notwithstanding the rather rough execution of our relief); at the same time, we can observe an intended adaptation of some “aulic” or “heroic” motifs to a different content. On the other hand, the oddness of the subject, which seems unparalleled in Greek art, drives us to interpret on a metaphorical, rather than on a literal, level the meaning of the scene, through the well-known nexus of associations between hunting and eros, and between the wild she-bear and the “untamed” parthenos. If we accept such a metaphorical reading, we can argue that the architectural terracottas from San Biagio examined here are thematically linked, suggesting an “initiation” scenario and a general concern about maturation and “domestication” of young people, and shedding some light on their proper cultural and religious context...|$|R
40|$|The {{preserved}} {{presentations of}} the Byzantine basileis of the XIII, XIV and XV centuries {{show that the}} creators of the late Byzantine monarchical portraits adhered to certain traditional rules when selecting the personages from the ruling house, which they were to portray. Defining which figures were to be depicted in the portrayal of power depended {{to a large extent}} on the changing circumstances and events in the imperial house. However, at the same time this was also based on a significantly more profound conception that rested on principles that had evolved {{in the course of a}} long history. The understanding of who could personify power was refracted through the prism of ideology and reflected in carefully shaped iconographic matrices. The omission of the images of certain members of the ruler's house, just as much as their inclusion, carried a certain meaning, as did the hierarchical arrangement of those who were portrayed. Generally speaking, this depended on the degree of their kinship with the sovereign, their sex, titles or dignities, and the connection of the members of the dynasty with the emperor's particular marriage. Therefore, one can rather clearly distinguish certain constants, if not rules, according to which some figures were omitted and others included, and, the specific changes that occurred from the end of the Middle Byzantine period till the fall of the Empire. The development of a unique kind of feudalism played a particular role in the specific characteristics in determining who was to appear in the monarchical portraits of the Palaiologan epoch in Byzantium and the states in its neighbourhood. As the preserved portrait ensembles and known written testimonies indicate, we find the images of the rulers' daughters did not feature in presentations of the 'emperors of the Romans' from the Late Byzantine period. In the Palaiologan epoch, they did not participate in the governing of the state nor were they taken into consideration in plans for succession to the throne. In the earlier period of Byzantine history, slightly different circumstances and views prevailed. That is why, owing to some specific circumstances, the emperor's daughters were sometimes depicted in the portraits of the imperial family. However, from the time of the Komnenoi when the medieval dynastic awareness finally asserted itself in Byzantium, the images of the emperor's female progeny practically vanished from the pictures of those who wielded supreme authority. The custom of omitting the figures of the emperors' daughters from the presentations of the ruling houses was also accepted and rather strictly obeyed for a long time in the portraiture of the neighbouring Orthodox Christian countries. In Serbia, this was disregarded only till just before the state collapsed, while in Bulgaria, exceptions to this rule were observed a little earlier. This was the result of accepting the ideological and <b>iconographic</b> <b>models</b> that were distinctive for the nobility, at the height of the feudal period. The images of daughters-in-law had always been omitted even more consistently than in the case of the figures of daughters in the monarchical presentations of the Byzantine and other Orthodox Christian rulers. As a rule, they were not depicted close to the image of the sovereign, even when they were the wives of the proclaimed and even crowned co-rulers, and successors to the throne. It is very probable that this custom survived into the Palaiologan era even though there are some signs that in Byzantium, this rule may have been disregarded in some cases. The figures of sovereigns' wives and sons had a significantly different status from the images of daughters and daughters-in-law. As a rule, they played an essential and customary role in the monarchical presentation because the rulers' wives and male successors had a stake in authority, in its transfer and succession. Still, it often happened that even wives and sons were omitted from such a presentation - all or some of them. The principle of presenting the individual portraits of emperors was inaugurated in early Byzantium and later, was continually applied even when depicting rulers who were married and had numerous offspring. Different factors could have influenced the decision to depict the monarch alone, even trivial factors. Nonetheless, when insisting on the individual image of the emperor, the ideology upon which this image was based was crucial. The separate portrait of the supreme ruler best explained the iconic essence of monarchical power as a reflection of the King of Heaven and brought to the forefront the exclusivity of the emperor's mimetic collusion with the divine source of power. That is why such a presentation was able to represent the idea and the authority of all earthly majesty through the image of one anointed man. The introduction in the monarchical portrait of the ruler's sons, who were not crowned or proclaimed co-emperors, is a very interesting phenomenon that was characteristic of monumental and miniature painting in the Palaiologan epoch. In the Middle Byzantine period, only those male descendents, who had the status of co-rulers and were crowned, were depicted next to the imperial sovereign. The custom of including uncrowned sons and ruler's sons who had not been initiated in the affairs of state in the presentation of the ruler's house can also be observed from the second half of the XIII to the middle of the XV century in Serbia. It appears that this custom also left traces even in Bulgarian art. On the other hand, the images of the ruler's sons, who had not received the imperial crown, were omitted in the presentations on coins dating from the Palaiologan epoch. Such action was fully in keeping with ancient Byzantine customs in defining the monetary image of authority. An exception could be only one type of coin that many believe to have been produced in the time of Andronikos III, which bore the image of the very young emperor's son, John. Nevertheless, it is more probable that this coin came into being during the regency period, after Andronikos' death in 1341 and the coronation of John V. A little later in the Palaiologan era, however the image of the co-ruler was omitted in the Byzantine monetary image of authority even when he was crowned and bore the title of autokrator. Apparently, the joint presentations of the rulers and co-rulers disappeared completely from Byzantine coins, after the final rupture between John V Palaiologos and John VI Kantakouzenos. In fact, not one of the types of coins bearing the joint images of the ruler and co-ruler has been reliably attributed and classified in this period. Meanwhile, it is important to note that the suppression of the joint presentation of the emperor and co-emperor on Byzantine coins occurred parallel to the unusual appearance of separate co-ruler coins. Separate coins were produced simultaneously by John V and Matthew Kantakouzenos, John V and Andronikos IV, Manuel II and John VII. The production of such coins reflected the complicated political circumstances in the Empire. The situation was affected not only by clashes between the rulers and the co-rulers but also by the periodical assumption of supreme power by the co-rulers, as well as by the later development of Byzantine feudalism. Circumstances characteristic of the later period in Byzantium, which was caught up in a particular process of feudalisation, changed the customs and led to unusual iconographic solutions even in other media. An illustrative example of this is the well-known ivory pixis, which is kept in the Dumbarton Oaks Collection in Washington. Displayed on it, despite the customs of long ago, are the two separate imperial families of John VII, and Manuel II, one beside the other. In iconographic terms, this looks less like a presentation of co-rulership and more like a presentation of almost parallel rules. In the Late Byzantine epoch, another peculiarity is that the image of the augusta is only encountered in exceptional circumstances on coins of the Byzantine Empire. Among the numerous empresses from the Palaiologan dynasty, only Anne of Savoy was depicted on coins and this seems to be just from the moment when she became the regent. Meanwhile, on the presentations of the rulers of the Serbian and Bulgarian states, one can follow the iconographic consequences of the dynastic complications caused by the remarriages of the rulers. The monarchical presentations from the period of the kings Milutin and Stefan Dečanski, or the emperor John Alexander, show that it was quite hard to assemble the figures of the new wives of the said rulers and the sons of those same rulers from their earlier marriages, who were heirs to the throne near the figure of the state's sovereign ruler. If one desired to present a clear dynastic situation, those persons ruled each other out. Sometimes, the ruler's son from a previous marriage took precedence, while in another case the emphasis was on the new queen and her offspring...|$|R

Te niewielkie kompozycje graficzne dla dawnych czytelników, zaznajomionych z heraldyką, także nierycerską i nieszlachecką, były komunikatami o proweniencji druku, tożsamości, pochodzeniu czy przynależności społecznej jego wytwórcy. Dla dzisiejszego odbiorcy symbolika sygnetów z epoki początków „czarnej sztuki” bywa znana i czytelna, częściej jednak pozostaje całkiem zagadkowa lub zrozumiała tylko po części. Autorka na kartach swojej książki podjęła w bardzo zajmujący sposób próbę hipotetycznej rekonstrukcji genezy przedstawień wizualnych i formuł werbalnych współistniejących w sygnetach drukarskich, szukając wzorców ikonograficznych i źródeł ideowych owych kompozycji graficznych, używanych w XVI w. w drukarniach czynnych w Królestwie Polskim i Wielkim Księstwie Litewskim oraz analizując wymowę tych znaków i ich odbiór przez współczesnych. Niezwykle ciekawa lektura dla edytorów, filologów i historyków naukowo zainteresowanych tematem, ale także dla miłośników dziejów druku. Publikacja bogato ilustrowana, opatrzona zestawieniem bibliograficznym, indeksem osobowo-geograficznym i streszczeniem w języku angielskim. Printers’ {{devices were}} {{compositions}} that served {{to identify the}} products of individual publishers and printers. The early 15 th-century marks were regarded {{in the first place}} as a commercial convenience, but since they developed out of the pictorial vocabulary of medieval non-noble heraldry, they served as intelligible signs providing information about the origins of the publications: they identified books’ producers and spoke about printers’ and publishers’ social status and places of activity. Later development added marketing potential to the printers’ devices’ marketing potential. Remaining symbols of recognition and signs of identification, they started to be designed to represent their owners’ religious affiliations and self-image, to reflect publishers’ and printers’ education and ambitions as well as their publishing programme. Sygnety drukarskie w Rzeczypospolitej XVI wieku. Źródła ikonograficzne i treści ideowe discusses the printers’ devices used in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in the 16 th century. It explores printers’ devices transition from simple signs towards symbolic compositions, concentrating on the ideological inspirations and <b>iconographic</b> <b>models</b> of the devices. As a result, it proposes interpretations for the devices used by early printers in Poland-Lithuania. On the one hand it reconstructs what the local printers wanted to communicate with their devices, but on the other, it speculates about the message that the contemporary readers might have understood when coming across these compositions in books that reached their hands. The book industry of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was less developed than the early print culture in Italy, the German-speaking lands or France, and consequently the number of printers’ devices used in the country was small in comparison with the device inheritance of other European realms. But the Polish-Lithuanian devices confirm that the textual and visual discourses of the printers’ marks were pan-European, reflecting the networked communities of the European centres of learning and commerce, especially the universities and towns. The introduction (“Wprowadzenie”) provides a methodological point of departure for the monograph and establishes its theoretical framework, more specifically seeking its aim is to define the printer’s device. The first chapter that follows (“Sygnet w strukturze książki”/“A device in the structure of a book”) analyses a role of the printer’s device within the early printed book referring to the material printed in 15 th- and 16 th-century Poland-Lithuania. Chapter 2 (“Tradycje heraldyczne”/“Heraldic traditions”) investigates a group of devices rooted in the medieval tradition of heraldic recognition. These compositions usually adopted merchants’ marks as their most important visual components, made use of burghers’ arms assumed by the printers, coats of arms granted to them and the representations of the printers’ patron saints. This chapter discusses devices found in books published or printed by a Krakow bookman, Jan Haller (active in Krakow, first as a tradesman who could supply the books, and later as a printer). Haller identified his products with a group of different woodcuts that included his merchant’s mark: a minuscule h combined with a double cross. Drawing on archival materials and museum artefacts, chapter 2 shows how Haller’s Hausmarke also served as a signifier and an identifier in products other than books (i. a. it labelled sheets from the paper mill that Haller owned in Prądnik Czerwony near Krakow). Jan Haller employed used his merchant’s mark in his devices for almost two decades (1505 - 1524), never trying to experiment with more inventive compositions. At the same time the European printers were already testing symbolic devices of classical models and of emblematic affinity. This phenomenon revealed the evolution of the printers’ ambitions, and mirrored changes in how members of the new generation understood their social standing and professional position. In Poland-Lithuania, and first in Krakow, printers started to adapt this new tendency by employing devices that integrated their merchants’ marks into more sophisticated, symbolic compositions. A way of merging heraldic tradition with a symbolic or emblematic mode in a printer’s device could be that of making the printer’s Hausmarke a part of a design that on the one hand was a rebus signature of the printer, but on the other, had a symbolic value. That is why the second chapter of Sygnety drukarskie w Rzeczypospolitej XVI wieku tells us about devices used by Maciej Szarfenberg, Maciej Wirzbięta and Mateusz Siebeneicher. Particularly interesting are the devices of the latter two printers. Each of these woodcuts displayed a shield with a merchant’s mark hanging on a tree presented in the centre of a monumental cartouche. Hausmarken identified the printers and provided demarcations of class and status. Trees were the supporters and referred to the printers’ surnames: a willow-tree, Polish “wierzba”, for Wirzbięta, and an oak, German “die Eiche”, for Siebeneicher. The result in each case was a readily understood rebus, but also a design that conveyed intrinsic meaning associated with certain moral and social values. For example in the case of Wirzbięta’s devices, the willow was chosen to reappear in the printer’s books not only because it constituted a pun on his name, but also because it could be read {{as a symbol of the}} virtues of the Calvinists. Presented usually in union with the printer’s personal sign (the initials M and W), the tree denoted religious affiliations of Wirzbięta, and helped the device become a vehicle of self-propagandisation since it suggested the printers’ perseverance in his faith. This function of the printer’s device was perhaps most visible in the earliest woodcuts that Wirzbięta used, where Maciej’s initials were both embedded on a shield hanging from a willow-tree and placed under the representations of Caritas and Fides in the upper corners of the device’s cartouche. Since the virtues’ vernacular names in Polish - Miłość/Miłosierdzie (Eng. Love/Charity) and Wiara (Eng. Faith) - begin with the same letters as the printer’s name and surname, the device’s conceptual character was particularly manifest here. Its composition was organized around a printer’s merchant’s mark and a representation that was both a pun on his name and a symbol of ethical conduct and religious affiliations. The last part of chapter 2 centres on the heraldic devices used by Szarfenberger family in Krakow (all repeated the coat of arms granted by the emperor to sons of Marek Scharfenber), Cyprian Bazylik in Brest Litovsk (Brześć Litewski) and Aleksander Augezdecki in Kaliningrad (Królewiec, Königsberg) and Szamotuły. In the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth mercantile and heraldic forms of mediaeval origin remained a viable pictorial tool for the producers and buyers of books well into the 16 th century. They belonged to iconographic traditions that were better known and better understood than classical imagery and the emblem genre. However, in the first decades of the 16 th century printers of the Commonwealth, first in Krakow, started to employ devices influenced by what Michael Pastoureau termed “pulsions emblématiques”. Either truly learned themselves or advised by the scholars and poets working for them, local printers began to choose signs inspired by symbolic and archetypal culture codes as their devices; they referred to classical sources, at times preclassical, traditio pagana et christiana, as well as to mediaeval imagery, and - finally - to the modern books of emblems. Printers’ devices imitated emblem picturae (quite frequently using devices of other publishing houses as their direct models) or made use of common motives employed by both: printers and authors of the emblem books. The devices documenting this new trend in Poland-Lithuania are discussed in chapter 3 of Sygnety drukarskie w Rzeczypospolitej XVI wieku (“Antyczne źródła i emblematyczny filtr”/”Classical sources and emblematic filter”). Chapter 3 opens with the analysis of the Terminus device of Hieronim Wietor that started to be in use in 1523. Terminus signalled Wietor’s humanistic views and life-long enthusiasm for Erasmus of Rotterdam, as the imagery of the mark was clearly based on the reverse of the portrait medal prepared for Erasmus by Quentin Matsys.

Objavljuje novu građu (Ruićev crtež portala, kapitele u svetištu, reljefe uzidane u zvonik, Jurjev kapitel iz palače), rekonstruira prvobitnu kompoziciju fasade, razlučuje djelo trojice kipara na njoj, predlaže atribuciju reljefa lunete porta!a Pribislaviću i objavljuje novu stilsko-likovnu interpretaciju fasade i revalorizaciju čitave crkve. Dokazujući pogrešno tumačenje ugovora kojim je Juraj bio obvezan dovršiti »pročelje iznad glavne apside« (»capella maioris«) a ne glavne fasade, pripisuje mu arhitektonsku i ikonografsku kompoziciju glavne fasade i grubu obradu skulptura na njoj, nasuprot mišljenjima da se ne vidi trag njegova učešća. On {{the basis}} of the {{complete}} analysis of architecture and sculpture of the collegiata church in Novi Pag (New Pag) founded in 1443. critical interpretation of the written and other sources, as well as on {{the basis of}} the comparative analysis of the church in Stari Pag (Old Pag) author examines the previous hypothesis in the competent literature which tackles the problems dependance between the old and the new churcb. He also discusses a non-exactly defined formulations on Georgius Mathei Dalmaticus 2 ̆ 7 s participation in constructing the collegiata church; author publishes the new evidence (Ruić 2 ̆ 7 s drawing of the portal, capitals in the sanctuary, reliefs built into the campanile walls) and reanalysing the former almost always inadequately treated sculpture on the fasade he recognises the work of three sculptors, and suggests a new iconographic and stylistic-artistic interpretation of the fasade as well as revaluation of the entire church. Emphasising the significance of Cvito Fisković 2 ̆ 7 s contribution (1935) in the previous interpretation of the collegiata in Pag author continues analysing the three main phases of construction: gothic, renaissance and baroque. In the first gothic phase sculptors Pavao and Juraj Dmitrovi from Zadar agree (1443 — 1445) upon constructing the three apses. after which the sacristy was built. The very spatial concept of the complete three naves (one nave and two aisles) type of basilica was also probably theirs. Author maintains that the three apsed sanctuary of the New Pag church is not only different but (for one whole stylistic phase) »more advanced« than the apsidal part of the church in Old Pag: square ribbed vaulted apses of the new church are typically gothic (influence of the mendicant orders) while in the church of Stari Pag and early romanesque compositios is applied in the central protuberant semioircled apse and lateral apses, immerged in the wall (variable of the istrian type, alike the one in Zadar cathedral). Author presumes that such archaic apses could not have been conceived by Paulus from Salmona, gothic sculptor and architect who modelled the reliefs on the main fasade (1392) as it had been suggested by some earlier authors (Fisković, Petricioli). Except the stylistic-typological reasons the technical analysis of the church in Stari Pag also proves that gothic fasade of the 14 th century was built in front of and earlier romanesque church. Second — gothlc-renaissance phase of collegiata in Novi Pag commenced by the intervention of Juraj Dalmatinac in the fourties of the 15 th century lasting up to the fifties of the 16 th century. Author considers that Juraj 2 ̆ 7 s could be the project of the principal fasade bearing the non-completed monumental high reljefs. Recheking the 1466. dated contract which has been constantly cited as the proof of Juraj 2 ̆ 7 s participation in the erection of the collegiata fasade in Pag — author assumes that subject of discussion in the document »frontespizio capella maggiore« (frontspice of the chapel) is not the church fasade because it undoubtely concerns the »fasade of the main apse«, respectively the main arch. It is by this document that we deduce Juraj 2 ̆ 7 s former participation parallel to the documented works performed on the city walls and towers of Pag in the Sth decade of the 15 th century — in reconstructing the previously but modestly built apsidal part of the church. The church apparently seeked for a more monumental aspect and the remains of this labour might be the two capitals built into the sanctuary pavement; it is possible that Juraj contrived the relief composition above the main arch (»fasade of the main apse«) executed later in the period of baroque. That Juraj also projected the main fasade of the church is not proved only by the late document (1492), but in author 2 ̆ 7 s opinion clearly displayed through the structural analysis. At the request of the investor some of the iconographic and formal elements from the old church were applied to the new fasade but it reveals a completely new gothic-renaissance structure; horizontal network of the four tectonically distributed cornices (the old one has only two) exchange with the vertically distributed reliefs-figures. Author reconstructs the former composition of the collegiata fasade maintaining that the middle of the gable was occupied by the semiflgure of Christ, now built into the campanile wall. The figure of the angel also built into the campanile was probably symmetrically situated with the identical angel at the southwest corner of the fasade (effigy of the Saint on the northern corner replacing the angel, might represent the mourning Madonna carved for the Juraj 2 ̆ 7 s composition on the triumphal arch). Through the analysis of the iconographic programme of the fasade author concludes that theologically-speculative and symbolic programme of the old churcb fasade had been transmitted into the new one with renaissance and humanistic features; similar creative interpretation occured in Šibenik cathedral and baptistry, the fact inducing author to ascribe the fasade of Pag also to Juraj. Instead of Archangel Gabriel, personifying the Annunciation on the old fasade, on the new one there is the scene of Annunciation with Virgin Mary and the pidgeon of the Holy Spirit; instead of two reliefs of St. George on the old fasade, here we have St. George and St. Michael, while the typically medieval figure of St. George on the horseback is being substituted by a typically renaissance standing figure. Assuming that Juraj himself defined the size and the volume of the sculptures, that is the high relifs on the fasade, author in their uncompleted dressing distinguishes three stonemasons: to the first one he assignes the unfinished figures of St. Michael and St. George (and perhaps St. Gabriel) in their idealistic gothic style; to the second obviously worse and almost naive stonemason he ascribes the Lady from the Annunciation and the semifigure of Christ (both of which are situated in the frame with indentation). To the third master, stylistically nearest to the Juraj 2 ̆ 7 s workshop author ascribes the sculpture of the angels with their wide spread wings, and the saint (maybe a Madonna). Reconstructing the former display of the main portal on the basis of Ruić 2 ̆ 7 s drawing which author presently publishes (with three pairs of columns instead of two and 12 stars around the Holy Vergin, showing the combination of the themes Virgin Assumption and Vergin of Mercy) author scrutinises, in details the relief of Virgin of Mercy on the lunette and concludes that the composition probably belongs to Juraj, but the execution for its emphasised realism and naturalistic details indicate the hand of his assistant Ivan Prlbislavić. Pribislavić also worked in Pag in those years (on the Bishop 2 ̆ 7 s palace) and we know of his collaboration with Juraj on costructing the portal of St. Francis church in Ancona [1454) established by the documents. The heads of the old men in the lintel of the Ancona portal typologically correspond to the men figures of the Pag lunetta. The churcb arcades with renaissance capitals, probably the work of Andrijić 2 ̆ 7 s workshop (C. Fisković) were constructed somewhat later and the latest is campanile over the sacristy (1552). Author proposes that campanile should not be connected to the romanesque one in Rab, or the renaissance campanile in Hvar (C. Fisković) because it represents the typical renaissance campanile, though particularily depending on the older traditions of trecento and with specific usage of reliefs on the fasade. The third phase of construction the collegiata belongs to the baroque renovation in the 18 th century when the lateral fasade with false arcades was renewed, and two portals opened, the main apse was rebuilt, changed the windows and stucco decorations installed on the ceiling. Both underlined problems in this study — the relation of the old and the new Pag churches — as well as the role of Juraj Dalmatinac (Georgius Mathei Dalmaticus) and his workshop overcross, under author 2 ̆ 7 s opinion, the boundaries of local interest, because the first problem is methodologically important in general, and the second pertains to the most important artistic opus in the middle of 15 th century on the East Adriatic coast. Insisting upon the originality and value of the <b>iconographic</b> programme and <b>modelling</b> of the principal fasade on the New Pag church author declares that it is an original and significant architectural and sculputral monument of the mixed gothic- renaissance style of the 15 th and 16 th century in Croatia...|$|R
