5|$|Although the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition was {{traditionally}} {{the most prestigious}} venue for English artists to display their new material, Watts chose to exhibit Hope at the smaller Grosvenor Gallery. In 1882 the Grosvenor Gallery had staged a retrospective exhibition of Watts's work and he <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> attachment to the venue. Also, at this time the Grosvenor Gallery was generally more receptive than the Royal Academy to experimentation. Hope was given the prime spot in the exhibition, in {{the centre of the}} gallery's longest wall.|$|E
5|$|In January 1934 the Black Hawks {{were on a}} train back to Chicago when Gardiner <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> intense pain in {{his throat}} that spread {{to the rest of}} his body, notably his kidneys. When {{questioned}} by Tommy Gorman about his issue, Gardiner lied to Gorman and insisted it was only a minor headache. However, when Gardiner woke up on the train in the morning, he had trouble seeing, as black spots obscured his vision. This was Gardiner's first uremic convulsion.|$|E

Zolile Nokwe plays Youssou Dubaku, Iké's younger brother.|$|E
5|$|In the NFL, the Philadelphia Eagles won the {{championship}} 7–0 during a blizzard in Philadelphia's Shibe Park. Following the win, Eagles owner Alexis Thompson advocated a championship {{game between the}} top teams in the NFL and the AAFC, {{in part because he}} was losing money and <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> inter-league championship would draw large crowds. Thompson was also a leading proponent among NFL owners of negotiation with the AAFC over a deal to ease the leagues' competition for talent, which had driven up salaries and was eating into owners' profits. Thompson met with Browns owner Mickey McBride and agreed to a playoff – either one game in Yankee Stadium or a best-of-three series with games in Philadelphia, Cleveland and possibly New York. Thompson's proposal was shot down by other NFL owners, however, and he was given a reprimand by commissioner Bert Bell for suggesting the NFL-AAFC championship. Frustrated with his financial losses and lack of support among the owners, Thompson sold the Eagles shortly after the season ended.|$|E

5|$|On February 4, 1860, {{two members}} of the company's board of {{directors}} wrote a letter requesting Helm's resignation; they claimed they had voted for his re-election as president of the company with the understanding that he would resign when the main line between Louisville and Nashville was finished. Helm maintained that he <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> obligation to the citizens of Logan County – many of whom he had personally sold stock to – to remain president until the Memphis branch through their county was built. The rift between Helm and the directors continued to widen, however. Helm resigned on February 21, 1860, and was replaced by James Guthrie. The Memphis branch was completed on September 24, 1860.|$|E
5|$|Fall Gelb ("Case Yellow"), {{the initial}} {{plan for the}} {{invasion}} of France, was prepared by Commander-in-Chief of the Army Colonel General (Generaloberst) Walther von Brauchitsch, Halder, {{and other members of}} the OKH in early October 1939. Like the Schlieffen Plan of World War I, it called for an encirclement attack through the Netherlands and Belgium. Hitler was not satisfied, so revisions of the plan continued throughout October. Manstein was not satisfied with the plan either, as it focused heavily on the northern wing; he <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> attack from this direction would lack the element of surprise and would expose the German forces to counterattacks from the south. The terrain in Belgium was not well-suited as a base of operations for further attacks on France, so Manstein felt the operation would fail to wipe out the enemy—as it did in the First World War—leading to only partial success and trench warfare. By the end of October Manstein had prepared the outline of a different plan and submitted it to the OKH via his superior, Rundstedt, for whom he was now serving as chief of staff of Army Group A.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} {{designer for}} nearly all entries in the series is Kimihiko Fujisaka. Initially a minor staff member at Cavia, the team were impressed by his skill as an amateur artist and he was recommended for the post of character designer for the game. The designs for both the characters and the world were influenced by armor and clothing of Medieval Europe. He returned in the same capacity for Drakengard 2, and later for Nier. Disliking some of his initial designs for Drakengard, he {{took the opportunity to}} remodel them more to his liking for the arcade game Lord of Vermilion. For Niers international release, the protagonist was redesigned from a teenager to an adult character. This was because the publishers <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> older character would appeal more to western players. In Drakengard 3, Fujisaka designed the protagonist Zero around the dark themes of the game, although some unusual elements were nearly cut. The other female characters were inspired by Puella Magi Madoka Magica, while the male characters, considered a low priority, were designed around male archetypes and approved quickly. For Nier: Automata, the designs were handled by Akihiko Yoshida, an artist noted for his work on the Final Fantasy series. While he was initially expected to refuse, he agreed as several staff at his company CyDesignation were fans of Nier. For his designs, Yoko requested he focus on smooth outlines and black coloring.|$|E

The UAW often won better wage and benefit packages than the Steelworkers {{and were able to}} obtain the closed shop. McDonald's negotiating stands often reflected the interunion jealousy.|$|E

25|$|In {{a minimum}} of 12 of the murders, Bonin was {{assisted}} {{by one or more}} of his four known accomplices. According to one attorney present throughout Bonin's subsequent confession, the escalating levels of brutality he had exhibited towards his victims had been similar to that of a drug addict requiring an ever-greater increase of dosage to attain a satisfactory level of euphoria, and Bonin later emphasized to neurologists he had <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> intense sense of excitement as he searched for his victims.|$|E
25|$|Thérèse <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> early call to {{religious}} life, and overcoming various obstacles, in 1888 {{at the early}} age of 15, she became a nun and joined two of her elder sisters in the cloistered Carmelite community of Lisieux, Normandy. After nine years as a Carmelite religious, having fulfilled various offices such as sacristan and assistant to the novice mistress, and having spent her last eighteen months in Carmel in a night of faith, she died at aged 24, following a slow and painful fight against tuberculosis.|$|E
