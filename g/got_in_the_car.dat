Saadoun and a friend of his made their way back home, hitchhiking from Latrun, and they arrived {{together}} at the Masmiya intersection. [...] At 19:30 a white Subaru car with Israeli license plates stopped at a hitchhiking stop. Mahmoud Naser and Mohammad sat in the vehicle, disguised as Israeli Jewish ultra orthodox men, and invited the soldiers to join them on a ride towards Ashkelon. Only Saadoun <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> since the back seat was loaded with equipment and therefore only one additional passenger could fit in the car. [...] The hijackers initially planned to drive Saadon to the Jabaliya refugee camp in Gaza. [...] However, after seeing an IDF patrol on their way they changed their direction, and drove towards Palmachim. During the ride the kidnappers struggled with Saadoun, and shot him in the head. The attackers buried Saadon's body in the Palmachim scrap site.|$|E
2500|$|Remarkably, Bore {{found the}} middle of the bat time and again, and when the last over started, another 14 runs were needed. Stephen Booth bowled the first ball of the season's last over and Bore scored a boundary. [...] The second ball went to the ropes again, and the third went for two runs. [...] Nottinghamshire needed four more runs from three balls to {{complete}} a remarkable win. Bore blocked the fourth ball and Andy Pick, Nottinghamshire's number 11, walked down the pitch to ask [...] "What did you do that for?" [...] "It wasn't in the right place." [...] Bore replied. The next delivery saw Bore launch a blow towards the stands. [...] The crowd and the entire Nottingham team were on their feet and Bore thought, as soon as he'd hit it, [...] "That's it, we've won". However Somerset's Richard Ollis ran in and caught the ball above his head, just ten feet from the boundary. [...] Nottinghamshire had lost by three runs and Bore's innings had been in vain. [...] As Bore related in an interview with Simon Lister [...] "We were stunned. We <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and I don't think we spoke a word until we were well past Gloucester. No matter how many times I lie in bed and replay that ball I never score those four runs".|$|E

In New Mexico, DeVille's wife Lisa committed suicide by hanging; DeVille discovered her body. He said:I got {{in a car accident}} because I got crazy.

It was reported that he completed the descent out of the mountains by staying in low gear.

Dugan claimed that after seeing Gacy's face following Gacy's 1978 arrest he realized that Gacy was the same man from the grocery store. Gacy prosecutor Terry Sullivan doubted the story, pointing out that not only did Dugan not come forward {{at the time of the}} crime, but the Dugan's story did not match Gacy's typical methods nor was Lisle known to be one of Gacy's hunting grounds. However, Sullivan said that Dugan fit the profile of Gacy's victims.|$|R

But more frustrating for Moore was the loss of over $12,000 in prize money. His lap prize money $2,200 and 13th place purse of $462 was of little consolation.|$|R

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the Department of History, University of MelbourneIt is entirely proper that I have travelled from Melbourne to Sydney to present a few thoughts on memory, history and smell. The first time I visited Sydney as an adult {{was at the end}} of a surfing safari along the coast from Melbourne. As we came into the metropolitan area four of us were in what might loosely be described as high spirits. I was driving, and the portable tape-recorder was probably playing one of those tuneful post-punk numbers that tended to be our favourites at the time. Elisa was the most excited of us all. She had spent some of her childhood in Sydney, and had not been back for many years. Going along one of the freeways that carve through the hills south of the city, I looked over to the passenger seat and was startled by a pair of legs. Elisa had not so much put her head out of the window as she was out the window, sitting on the door frame and hanging on to the roof-rack. She was laughing and sniffing and yelling, all at the same time. "Breathe... Breathe. Can't you smell it... can't you smell it!" Once we <b>got</b> her back <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> we agreed – yes, we could smell this place that for Elisa came with memories of smells and for us was a brand new sensation.
