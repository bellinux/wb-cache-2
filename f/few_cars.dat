5|$|Lewis Hamilton {{topped the}} time sheets in Saturday's free {{practice}} session, with Sebastian Vettel {{a tenth of}} a second behind, while Rosberg and Räikkönen completed the top four. <b>Few</b> <b>cars</b> took to the track during {{the early part of the}} session due to high temperatures and strong winds. A brief red flag period occurred midway through practice when Daniil Kvyat spun out in turn four.|$|E
5|$|Strong ground motions {{caused many}} {{secondary}} effects, including gas leaks and widespread soil liquefaction. Consequently, sand boils emerged from asphalt roads, toppling a <b>few</b> <b>cars</b> and sinking another. Several {{houses in the}} hill suburbs of Sumner and Redcliffs were affected by falling boulders from hillsides. Following its occurrence, much of Christchurch lost water pressure; residents were thus urged to conserve water use. In {{some parts of the}} Heathcote Valley, previously dormant or non-existent natural springs surfaced {{as a consequence of the}} sudden rise in the water table, flooding some properties.|$|E
5|$|The {{remnants}} of Alberto dropped heavy precipitation across North Carolina, including a nationwide high of 7.16inches (182mm) at the Raleigh National Weather Service Office. Some totals broke previous rainfall records, including the station at Raleigh-Durham International Airport which broke the all-time daily precipitation record for that station. The rainfall led to flooding across the central {{portion of the}} state, with 45flash flood warnings issued by the Raleigh National Weather Service. Police and firefighters in Wake County performed 47water rescues. Additionally, the Raleigh-Wake 9-1-1center received more than 1,076calls for help. Flash flooding occurred throughout the area, which caused the Crabtree Creek in Raleigh to crest at 23.77feet (7.2m); {{this was the second}} highest flood stage on record for the creek. The overflown creek flooded a <b>few</b> <b>cars</b> to their rooftops, and resulted in the closure of the Crabtree Valley Mall. Major flooding was reported elsewhere throughout the region, which closed several roads and damaged some houses. In Franklin County, an eight-year-old boy drowned after getting sucked into a flooded drainage system; the death is considered indirect because the boy was chasing a ball into the drainage system. Near the coast, the storm produced several waterspouts, some of which moved ashore in Dare and Carteret counties. Isolated reports of 60mph (95km/h) wind gusts resulted in downed trees and minor damage.|$|E
50|$|Companies that {{participated in}} the Optōmize Scion program include GReddy, OBX, RÄZO, a <b>few</b> <b>car</b> {{detailing}} companies, and others.|$|R
5000|$|Foxboro {{features}} a school, churches, a <b>few</b> <b>car</b> mechanics, an architectural woodshop, {{a convenience store}} {{as well as a}} Foodland, banks (ATM only), and several parks.|$|R
50|$|A {{total of}} 559 Superamericas were built; this number {{followed}} Enzo Ferrari's philosophy {{that there should}} always be one <b>fewer</b> <b>car</b> available than what the market demanded.|$|R
25|$|On the one hand, {{this makes}} it {{incorrect}} to apply traditional statistics {{that are based on}} variance and standard deviation (such as regression analysis). On the other hand, this also allows for cost-efficient interventions. For example, given that car exhaust is distributed according to a power-law among cars (very <b>few</b> <b>cars</b> contribute to most contamination) it would be sufficient to eliminate those very <b>few</b> <b>cars</b> from the road to reduce total exhaust substantially.|$|E
25|$|War Weapons Week {{was held}} from 15 to 20 July, and a <b>few</b> <b>cars</b> {{decorated}} {{for use as}} mobile National Savings booths were parked at the principal termini or loop lines.|$|E
25|$|To {{start of}} 2017, Menard survived wrecks in the Daytona 500, and {{brought home a}} 5th place finish after a <b>few</b> <b>cars</b> ran out of gas. The next week at Atlanta, he {{finished}} 25th.|$|E
5000|$|British pillarless hardtops {{included}} the Sunbeam Rapier and the Ford Consul Capri (355) which, unlike American models, sold <b>fewer</b> <b>cars</b> than their regular center pillar saloon versions.|$|R
50|$|The vessel has 163 {{cabins and}} a {{capacity}} of 1,215 passengers. She can carry 336 car-equivalents and/or 38 commercial vehicles (semi-trailer rigs or buses) and commensurately <b>fewer</b> <b>cars.</b>|$|R
50|$|The P1 {{was built}} only for one year. From June 1958 to June 1959, 34,282 were produced, which was <b>fewer</b> <b>cars</b> than the annualized output of either its direct {{predecessor}} or of its direct successor.|$|R
25|$|There {{are very}} <b>few</b> <b>cars</b> on the island, {{as they are}} tightly {{regulated}} and vehicular access is not allowed for non-residents, who have to leave their car in Fionnphort. Bike hire {{is available at the}} pier, and on Mull.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} week at Darlington, Earnhardt raced inside the Top 10 {{much of the}} night before settling for a 9th-place finish. He was one of only a <b>few</b> <b>cars</b> who were able to avoid being put a lap down by Kyle Busch.|$|E
25|$|There {{are very}} <b>few</b> <b>cars</b> on Heligoland. A special section (§50) in the German traffic {{regulations}} (Straßenverkehrsordnung, abbr. StVO) prohibits {{the use of}} automobiles and bicycles on the island. No other region in Germany has any exceptions to the general regulations in the StVO, although other North Sea islands, such as Baltrum, have also banned the public from using cars and motorbikes.|$|E
5000|$|Generate {{individual}} risks {{while keeping}} track of their dependencies {{with one another and}} with time (e.g., an increase in the price of gasoline might lead to less driving mileages of automobile policy holders, thus leading to <b>fewer</b> <b>car</b> accidents).|$|R
5000|$|There {{are quite}} a <b>few</b> <b>car</b> rental {{companies}} that can provide car hire service from the Airport. These companies are mainly located at [...] "Parking P4 - Car Hire". Car hire can also be arranged from within the airport.|$|R
50|$|The event {{attracted}} <b>fewer</b> <b>cars</b> than {{in previous}} years, with 59 racing cars registered for this event, instead of the 81 in 1958,. Of the 59 cars registered, 58 arrived for practice with 52 qualifying for and starting the race.|$|R
25|$|There is a wharf on Vaitupu but no harbour, meaning {{one must}} board a smaller boat from the inter-island passenger/cargo ships {{to get to}} the Vaitupu. There are paths and small unpaved roads {{throughout}} the island. Only a <b>few</b> <b>cars</b> drive on Vaitupu. In the main village there is a guest house called Vivalia III located at the wharf near the main church.|$|E
25|$|Village Homes in Davis, California is {{designed}} to allow car-free movement with an extensive system of pedestrian/bike paths, running through common areas that exhibit a variety of landscaping, garden areas, play structures, statuary, with most houses facing the common areas rather than the streets. The roads are all narrow, curving cul-de-sacs without sidewalks which give them the feel of village lanes; the <b>few</b> <b>cars</b> that venture into the cul-de-sacs usually travel slowly.|$|E
25|$|Primo de Rivera set his {{economic}} planners to building infrastructure for the country. Hydroelectric dams were constructed to provide water for irrigation {{and to bring}} electricity to some of Spain's rural regions. Spain had <b>few</b> <b>cars</b> {{when he came to}} power; by 1930, it possessed a network of automobile roads. His regime upgraded the country's railroads, helping the Spanish iron and steel industry to recover. Public works carried out in Málaga included the planning and creation of the Ciudad Jardín district and construction of the Gaitanejo reservoir (accomplished with private financing) in El Chorro.|$|E

30|$|The {{overall results}} showed {{that there was no}} {{substantial}} difference in friction of the road surface between lanes having 100 %, 75 % or 50 % of cars with studded tyres. However, the friction was much poorer in lanes having <b>fewer</b> <b>cars</b> with studded tyres.|$|R
50|$|Maurice Rothwell {{had become}} {{prominent}} in the Canoe Slalom hierarchy. As one of the <b>few</b> <b>car</b> owning people at that time he would assist the British Team when traveling abroad, and in his Official capacity officiated at the first Televised Slalom event which was in Doncaster.|$|R
25|$|When {{the game}} begins, Matt meets a person whom he doesn't know, {{and she tells}} him {{that they have to}} get to the bridge at a certain time. Later in the game, Matt goes through {{different}} cars because of the person that he doesn't know gets them for him (except for a <b>few</b> <b>cars</b> in The Run.) Matt asks her about her identity but she doesn't respond to his question. However, there is a conflict when they get to a certain area. There, Matt finds out that the unknown person was using him to get to that area.|$|E
25|$|The Bendix system's public {{debut in}} December 1956 was {{followed}} by a March 1957 price bulletin listing it as a US$395 option, but because of supplier difficulties, EFI Rebels would only be available after June 15. This was to have been the first production EFI engine, but Electrojector's teething problems meant only pre-production cars were so equipped: thus, very <b>few</b> <b>cars</b> so equipped were ever sold, and none were made available to the public. The Rambler's EFI was more advanced than the mechanical types then appearing on the market and the engines ran fine in warm weather, but suffered hard starting in cooler temperatures. As a result, all of the production Rebels used a four-barrel carburetor. Nevertheless, the EFI option remained in the published owner's manual.|$|E
25|$|The {{front-wheel drive}} Medallion used the 2.2L I4 engine that also powered the European Renault 25. It was mounted in a {{longitudinal}} (front-back) configuration, driving {{the front wheels}} through either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 3-speed computer-controlled automatic. The longitudinal engine placement is unusual for a front-wheel drive car, as the transverse engine layout is typically more space-efficient. It {{was one of a}} <b>few</b> <b>cars</b> with this layout, which helps reduce torque steering. The gearbox is centrally mounted resulting in equal-length axle shafts. In Europe, Renault 21 versions with engine displacements below 2L had transverse engines, just like smaller models such as the Renault 9. Higher-end R 21 versions with engines of 2L or more, retained the longitudinal layout of the previous Renault 20 and 30 series. The longitudinally mounted versions had a shorter wheelbase than the European transverse versions. Product plans also called for a four-wheel drive Medallion to be imported in late-1988.|$|E
50|$|As a {{co-operative}} business, Modo’s {{mandate is}} to {{serve the needs of}} its members and community by reducing dependency on privately owned vehicles, by allowing more people to share <b>fewer</b> <b>cars.</b> Doing so reduces traffic congestion and pollution, and the demands on land use for parking; thereby contributing to more livable communities.|$|R
50|$|Sunnybrook Park {{is a major}} park in Toronto {{that connects}} to the Don Valley (it's west of the Don Valley). It {{is home to the}} Sunnybrook Stables, Dog parks and many sport fields. There are also a lot of bike and walking paths, with a <b>few</b> <b>car</b> {{permitted}} roads here and there.|$|R
50|$|Benediktas Vanagas (born 16 March 1977) is a Lithuanian rally driver. Vanagas {{is one of}} the <b>few</b> <b>car</b> racers in the Baltic {{states who}} has {{achieved}} strong results in rallying, cross country racing, and off-road competitions, though he most often competed as a rally driver. He {{is a member of the}} General Financing team.|$|R
25|$|Henry Ford's {{first attempt}} at a car company under his own name was the Henry Ford Company on November 3, 1901, which became the Cadillac Motor Company on August 22, 1902, after Ford left with the rights to his name. The Ford Motor Company was {{launched}} in a converted factory in 1903 with $28,000 in cash from twelve investors, most notably John and Horace Dodge (who would later found their own car company). During its early years, the company produced just a <b>few</b> <b>cars</b> a day at its factory on Mack Avenue and later its factory on Piquette Avenue in Detroit, Michigan. Groups {{of two or three}} men worked on each car, assembling it from parts made mostly by supplier companies contracting for Ford. Within a decade, the company would lead the world in the expansion and refinement of the assembly line concept, and Ford soon brought much of the part production in-house in a vertical integration that seemed a better path for the era.|$|E
25|$|In 1956, {{federal and}} {{regional}} transportation planners proposed an Inner Loop Expressway composed of three circumferential beltways for the District of Columbia. The middle beltway would have begun at the proposed Barney Circle Freeway near Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, until it terminated near 37th Street NW {{at the north}} end of Georgetown. Two decades of protest led to the cancellation of all but the I-395 and I-695 portions of the plan, and the unbuilt portions of the project were finally cancelled in 1977. The failure to complete the Inner Loop left the Sousa Bridge's approaches incomplete and confusing. Unmarked Interstate 695 delivered three lanes of traffic to a one-lane on-ramp to the bridge, and traffic backed up for miles every day as a traffic light allowed only a <b>few</b> <b>cars</b> onto the bridge's southbound lanes during rush hour. An off-ramp delivered most northbound bridge traffic around the incomplete Barney Circle and under the bridge onto Interstate 695 westbound.|$|E
25|$|On lap 172, Juan Pablo Montoya passed Hamlin for the lead, but {{his lead}} {{did not last}} for long as Kahne passed him three laps later. During green flag pit stops from lap 200 to lap 219, Hamlin, Jeff Burton, Bill Elliott, and Kahne all {{exchanged}} the lead, with Kahne regaining the lead after the pit stops. On lap 224, the seventh caution came out again because of debris, this time on the front stretch. Kahne again led the field to the green flag on the restart, but his lead was cut short by Kurt Busch who passed him on lap 230. After 14 laps, Kahne again led until his green flag pit stop on lap 277. After the pit stop, the leader was Kahne until lap 288, when the eighth caution came out because Hamlin blew a tire. Kurt Busch led the field to the green flag; on the same lap, the ninth caution came out as Max Papis and Elliott Sadler collided with the wall. Only a <b>few</b> <b>cars</b> pitted, and Kurt Busch led the field to the green flag on the restart.|$|E
50|$|As a result, Matapédia {{was where}} two Via Rail routes diverged {{en route to}} their eastern termini, whereas they converged when heading westbound. The 6 day/week Halifax-Montreal Ocean and 3 day/week Montreal - Gaspé train {{operated}} as one train between Matapédia and Montreal in the winter time when each separate train has <b>fewer</b> <b>cars.</b>|$|R
50|$|With {{increased}} {{costs and the}} competition of Politoys, Mebetoys, and other mass producers of diecast toys in Europe, Mercury had more and more difficulty keeping up (Force 1992, p. 6). Through the 1970s, <b>fewer</b> and <b>fewer</b> <b>cars</b> were produced. The last model was the Fiat Ritmo and the company closed its doors in 1978.|$|R
50|$|Within {{the city}} and its {{immediate}} surroundings most distances can be covered on foot or with a bicycle. Several streets are off-limits to vehicle traffic and within the city centre road speed regulations prescribe 30 km/h as the maximum speed limit, making it a pedestrian and bicycle-friendly city. There are also a <b>few</b> <b>car</b> parking lots.|$|R
