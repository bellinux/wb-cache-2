50|$|Due {{to their}} {{toxicity}} and low nucleophilicity, organomercury compounds find limited use. The oxymercuration reaction of alkenes to alcohols using mercuric acetate proceeds via organomercury intermediates. A related reaction forming phenols is the Wolfenstein-Boters reaction. The toxicity {{is useful in}} antiseptics such as thiomersal and merbromin, and fungicides such as <b>ethylmercury</b> <b>chloride</b> and phenylmercury acetate.|$|E
5000|$|Ethylmercury (sometimes ethyl mercury) is a cation {{composed}} of an organic CH3CH2- species (an ethyl group) bound to a mercury(II) centre, {{making it a}} type of organometallic cation, and giving it a chemical formula is C2H5Hg+. It {{is one of the}} metabolites of thiomersal (thimerosal or sodium ethyl mercuric thiosalicylate), which is used as a preservative in some vaccines. The term [...] "ethylmercury" [...] is also sometimes used as a generic term to describe organomercury compounds which include the ethylmercury functional group, such as <b>ethylmercury</b> <b>chloride</b> and ethylmercury urea.|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we report a method for direct vapor {{generation}} of mercury species on nano TiO 2 under UV irradiation {{in the presence of}} a formic acid and sodium formate mixture as a hole scavenger. A novelly designed UV/TiO 2 photocatalysis reaction device (UV/TiO 2 PCRD) was used as an effective sample introduction unit and an interface for mercury species determination by atomic fluorescence spectrometry (AFS) and speciation by HPLC-AFS for the first time. The detection limits of 10, 20, 30 and 70 pg mL(- 1) of mercury chloride, methylmercury chloride, <b>ethylmercury</b> <b>chloride</b> and phenylmercury chloride, respectively, were achieved by AFS using flow injection mode. Compared with the traditional KBH 4 /NaOH-HCl system, UV/TiO 2 PCRD is a superior alternative for online vapor generation of Hg species...|$|E
40|$|A capacitively coupled {{low power}} {{atmospheric}} pressure rf He plasma established within a thermostated cylindrical steel block {{serves as a}} source for the generation of molecular and atomic ions for mass spectral analysis. Volatile analytes separated by gas chromatography are admitted to the source through a coaxial rf-powered center electrode. Variation of the forward power, in the range 52 Ì† 013100 W, and the position of the plasma relative to the differentially pumped extraction orifice of the mass spectrometer, permits control over the relative intensities of parent and daughter ion products of the decomposition of organometallic compounds introduced into the source. Spectral features range from simple response from atomic ions to the detection of the parent molecular compounds and combinations of the two between the extremes of operating conditions. Ferrocene, triethyllead chloride and <b>ethylmercury</b> <b>chloride</b> were used to illustrate the application of the technique. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|An {{automatic}} system, {{based on}} the on-line coupling of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation, post column microwave digestion, and cold-vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry (CVAFS) detection, was proposed for the speciation analysis of four mercury compounds. Post column microwave digestion, {{in the presence of}} potassium persulfate (in HCl), was applied in the system to improve the conversion efficiency of three organic mercury compounds into inorganic mercury. Parameters influencing the on-line digestion efficiency and the separation effect were optimized. To avoid water vapor and methanol entering into the atomic fluorescence detector, ice-water mixture bath was used to cool the rnicrowave-digested sample solution. Four mercury species including inorganic mercury chloride (MC), methylmercury chloride (MMC), <b>ethylmercury</b> <b>chloride</b> (EMC) and phenylmercury chloride (PMC) were baseline separated within 13 min by using RP C 18 column with a mobile phase of 50 % (v/v) methanol containing 10 mmol 1 (- 1) tetrabutyl ammonium bromide and 0. 1 mol 1 (- 1) sodium chloride pumped at 1. 2 ml min(- 1). Seafood samples, composed of three gastropod species and two bivalve species from Yantai port, China, have been analyzed by the proposed method. Dogfish muscle (DORM- 2) was analyzed to verify the accuracy of the method and the result was in good agreement with the certified value. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B. V...|$|E
40|$|Inductively coupled plasma-mass {{spectrometry}} (ICP-MS) offers exceptional {{sensitivity and}} multi-element capability for trace metal analysis but {{the formation of}} polyatomic ions (particularly below m/z = 80) can cause, serious interferences. Such species can be introduced via precursor atoms in atmospheric gases, the sample matrix or impurities in the argon support gas. This thesis describes {{the development of a}} portfolio of analytical methods coupled with ICP-MS detection for the determination of trace metals such as manganese, cobalt, copper, nickel, zinc, mercury and lead in complex matrices such as sea water. A literature review of coupled techniques is given in Chapter one. Chapter two discusses the effect of sea water on the analytical performance of ICP-MS. Initial studies were carried out using a single channel flow injection (FI) manifold and included an investigation of the addition of nitrogen to the nebulizer gas flow of the ICPMS for the reduction of the ArNa* polyatomic ion interference at m/z = 63 on the Cu signal. This was followed by a multivariate simplex optimisation for the suppression of the ArNa* polyatomic ion interference at m/z = 63 and non-spectroscopic interferences affecting other masses in sea water, for the determination of Cu, Cr, Mn, Ni, Co, Zn and Pb. In Chapter three an on-line FI-ICP-MS matrix elimination method for the determination of trace metals such as Mn, Co, Cu, Zn and Pb in sea water is discussed. The method involved chelation of the analytes onto Chelex- 100 or MetPac CC- 1 iminodiacetate (IDA). resin, with the simultaneous removal of indirectly interfering matrix species, particularly Na and CI ions. Results showing how the effects of the interferences were overcome, together with validation of the method by the analysis of open ocean, coastal and estuarine certified reference materials are reported. s Chapter four compares FI approaches coupled with AFS, ICP-AES and ICP-MS detectors for the determination of total mercury. Initial studies compared figures of merit for FI (conventional pneumatic nebulization) and Fl-cold vapour generation (CVG) coupled with ICP-AES and ICP-MS. Detection limits for total Hg were improved by developing simple on- and off-line preconcentration procedures using a MetPac CC- 1 micro-column incorporated in a FI manifold vAth conventional pneumatic nebulization. An AFS detector was then used {{in the development of a}} method for the determination of total mercury with an on-line bromide/bromate oxidation step. In chapter five an LC-ICP-MS method for the speciation of Hg in sea water samples is described. The method involved the separation of mercury(II) chloride, methylmercury chloride and <b>ethylmercury</b> <b>chloride</b> on a Cig ODS stationary phase with an ammonium acetate/acetonitriIe/ 2 -mercaptoethanol mobile phase. In order to achieve the necessary detection limits required for the determination of mercury in real sea water samples (< 50 ng r^), an off-line preconcentration method using a dithiocarbamate resin was used.
