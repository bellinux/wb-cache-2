40|$|Effects of mould flux {{contaminant}} on scale-steel adhesion and hydraulic <b>descaling</b> {{of scale}} formed on slabs were investigated. In this investigation, stainless steel type 304 (austenitic with 18 % Cr and 8 % Ni) and specific mould fluxes were used when growing the scale on contaminated samples under simulated industrial reheating conditions, with subsequent {{high pressure water}} hydraulic <b>descaling.</b> The basic hypothesis was that the steel-scale adhesion depends on the microstructure of different phases present in the scale, the segregation of specific elements at the interface and the interfacial morphology of the scale after reheating. It was found that mould flux contaminant decreases scale-steel adhesion and therefore improved the <b>descaling</b> effectiveness significantly compared to non contaminated stainless steel. The <b>descaling</b> effectiveness of contaminated and uncontaminated slab was dependent {{to the presence of}} metal free paths (chromite layers along the austenite grains boundaries) and the presence of unoxidized metal in the scale due to nickel enrichment at the interface. Compared to the uncontaminated samples, the <b>descaling</b> of contaminated samples was efficient which could be {{due to the fact that}} some mechanisms which increase scale– steel adhesion (notably nickel enrichment at the interface) were considerably reduced.

50|$|A {{shower head}} is a {{perforated}} nozzle that distributes water over solid angle {{a focal point}} of use, generally overhead the bather. A shower uses less water than a full immersion in a bath. Some shower heads can be adjusted to spray different patterns of water, such as massage, gentle spray, strong spray, and intermittent pulse or combination modes. Hard water may result in calcium and magnesium deposits clogging the head, reducing the flow and changing the spray pattern. For descaling, various acidic chemicals or brushes can be used or some heads have rubber-like jets that can be manually <b>descaled.</b> A homemade remedy is to immerse it in a solution of water and vinegar for a while, since the vinegar is able to dissolve limescale.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 1997 During May-June, 1995 and 1996, outmigrating chum salmon, Oncorhynchus keta, and chinook salmon, O. tschawytscha, were {{captured}} in the Chena River near the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project. Fish condition was determined through the investigation of physical injury and scale loss. Except for one sample, the proportion of injured fish was never greater than 7 % for chum or chinook salmon. Few injuries were severe. The proportion of chinook salmon with scale loss ranged from 1 - 33 %, {{most of which were}} only partially <b>descaled.</b> When significant length differences existed, injured, <b>descaled,</b> and partially <b>descaled</b> fish were always larger than non-injured and non-descaled fish. Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) diet by weight consisted of chum salmon (2 %), invertebrates (89 %), other fish (3 %), and miscellaneous material (6 %).

40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of {{morphological}} variation and basking posture on thermal characteristics in the speckled wood butter ̄y Pararge aegeria (L.). The process of heating and cooling in relation to wing type (<b>descaled,</b> darkened and original wing colour) and size was examined using dummies (i. e. dried butter ̄ies). Size (measured as wing length) and ambient temperature have a joint in ̄uence on body temperature: large butter ̄ies heat up more slowly than small ones, but with increasing ambient temperature the difference with size became smaller and even changed since large individuals heated up faster under warm ambient conditions. Surprisingly, darkening wings had no overall effect on thermal characteristics, but this may be an artefact of the manipulation as supported {{by the results of}} the absorption measurements. Normal butter ̄ies reached a higher equilibrium thoracic temperature than <b>descaled</b> butter ̄ies probably because wings without scales absorb less radiation. Finally, butter ̄ies with fully spread wings reached higher thoracic temperature and had faster cooling rates compared to butter ̄ies with half-opened wings. Implications of the results for the relation between morphology and behaviour of speckled wood butter ̄ies in their natural habitat are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Some {{surface defects}} on hot rolled steels arise due to poor descaling. Generally reheated slabs are {{efficiently}} <b>descaled</b> but, now and then, residual scale {{remains on the}} slab after primary descaling. Commonly {{it is difficult to}} trace the few poorly <b>descaled</b> slabs since there often is no scale monitoring system. In the work presented here an image based primary scale monitoring- and evaluation system is presented. It is a stand-alone online vision system consisting of a camera connected to a computer. The camera is located directly after the descaling unit and the computer in the control room. The program automatically locates the boundaries of the top surface of a slab and calculates the quantity of residual scale on the top surface. The quantity of residual scale is logged and can afterwards be evaluated together with process parameters and downstream surface defects to identify problem areas. The system has been tested in industrial scale in the Ruukki plate mill. This work is a cooperation between Swerea MEFOS and Ruukki. The result of the test demonstrated the feasibility of using vision system for detection of residual scale. Some problems were identified and suggestions for solving them are reported. If the suggested modifications are carried out, it is believed that the vision system can be an on-line tool for the operator and also be an off-line resource for the ongoing quality work at the hot rolling mill...|$|E

The morphological {{changes in the}} cuticle and surface of the cuticle-removed cortex were observed by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). When human hair was treated with dehydrated 5 % KOH/ 1 -butanol at 50 øC, {{the boundary between the}} exo- and endocuticles in a few outer layers became obscure at first, and the thickness of a layer decreased with the simultaneous dissolution of the outermost layer.

Screen efficiency estimates are 99 % ({+-} 0. 6 %) for Toppenish Creek, 99 % ({+-} 0. 3 %) for Wapato, and 98 % ({+-} 0. 5 %) for Sunnyside. During 1987 at the Wapato Canal, we estimated screen efficiency was 97 % ({+-}l%). We conducted descaling tests at the Toppenish Creek Screens. We estimated that 0. 2 % of steelhead Qncorhynchus mykiss smelts released during tests were <b>descaled.</b> None of the fish released through the fish return pipe were <b>descaled.</b> We measured the time required for fish to move through the screen facilities. The time required for 50 % of the test fish to exit the Toppenish Creek Screen forebay was 4 to 9 h for rainbow trout fry and up to 39 h for steelhead smelts. The time for 50 % of the test fish to exit the Wapato and Sunnyside screen forebays was less than 8 h. As with past studies, exit times varied with canal flow and species. After 39 h at Toppenish Creek, half the steelhead smelts were still in the forebay when canal flows were 20 cfs. At Sunnyside, half the chinook salmon fry exited the forebay in 1 h or less.

40|$|This work is {{focussed}} on hydraulic descaling of hot surfaces. Hydraulic descaling is {{a process}} when layers of oxides are removed from hot steel surfaces during continuous rolling. High pressure water beam is used. Quality of <b>descaled</b> surfaces is important for final quality of rolled product. Insufficient descaling causes drop of final quality, degradation of rolls and lost of yields. High-pressure water beam has two effects on a scale layer. The first effect is mechanical caused by impact pressure. The second one is a relatively intensive thermal shock depending {{on a set of}} parameters (water pressure, nozzle type, distance from the surface, inclination angle, speed of product moving). There are a lot of theories about principles of scales removing. Main task of this work is to make it clear which theory is acceptable and which is just,,theory”. For this purpose mathematical modelling and experimental work were used. In experimental part, three types of experimental measurement were done. First one, measurement of dynamical effect of water beam – impact pressure. Second one, measurement of temperature drop when a product is passing under the nozzle. Measured data (temperatures) from this measurement are evaluated with inverse task and heat transfer coefficient is obtained. And the third experimental measurement is simulation of whole process of descaling. Quality of <b>descaled</b> surfaces is valuated according to amount of remained oxide scales. Data from firs and second experimental measurement are used as boundary conditions for mathematical modelling. For mathematical simulations, FEM (finite element method) system ANSYS was used. Obtained data from experimental measurement were applied on 2 D and 3 D models of basic steel material with layer of scale.

40|$|The {{issue of}} <b>descaling</b> is an {{important}} part of the forging and heat treatment of steel and semi products of steel production. Rising of new information and study of this process can increase efficiency and improve the surface quality after <b>descaling.</b> This thesis is focused on the mechanisms of the high pressure hydraulic <b>descaling</b> qualification and study of the chemical compounds of which the scales grown. To achieve all goals of this work and to get a comprehensive view of <b>descaling</b> process, few experimental measurements and numerical analyses were performed. All experimental measurements were focused on obtaining data about fundamental parameters and effects of the hydraulic <b>descaling.</b> The data obtained from measurements were applied to numerical analyses, which aimed to discover a deeper relation and to confirm the experimental results. This thesis can be divided into two main parts. The first part is devoted to parameters of the water jet study. The main studied characteristics of the high pressure hydraulic water jet were heat transfer coefficient and impact pressure at different modes such as standard or pulsating water jet. Experimentally measured data of these parameters were applied in numerical analyses. The numerical analyses were focused on studying the impact of the water jet parameters on the stresses in the oxide scale layers. A further water jet analysis was focused on the influence of the individual parts of the hydraulic system (such as water chamber or stabilizer) on its characteristics. In this part different types of the water chambers in combination with different types of stabilizers on the impact pressure values were investigated. These measurements were supported by fluid flow analysis through the hydraulic system. The second part of this work was focused on getting mechanical properties of the oxide scales from specimens prepared from standard structural steel and specimens from silicon steel. In this thesis, the influence of various parameters and characteristics was studied on these two types of steel. Mechanical properties of oxide scale structures were carried out by the Small Punch Test method. To obtain the fundamental mechanical properties such as Young´s modulus, yield strength and ultimate strength, material parameters based on the measured data were optimized. The whole work was carried out in order to get valuable and comprehensive results about high pressure hydraulic <b>descaling</b> process and influencing factors as well as about oxide scales themselves...|$|R
