40|$|Fisher linear {{discriminant}} analysis (FLDA) is a classic linear feature extraction and dimensionality reduction approach for face recognition. It is known that geometric <b>distribution</b> <b>weight</b> information of image data {{plays an important role}} in machine learning approaches. However, FLDA does not employ the geometric <b>distribution</b> <b>weight</b> information of facial images in the training stage. Hence, its recognition accuracy will be affected. In order to enhance the classification power of FLDA method, this paper utilizes radial basis function (RBF) with fractional order to model the geometric <b>distribution</b> <b>weight</b> information of the training samples and proposes a novel geometric <b>distribution</b> <b>weight</b> information based Fisher discriminant criterion. Subsequently, a geometric <b>distribution</b> <b>weight</b> information based LDA (GLDA) algorithm is developed and successfully applied to face recognition. Two publicly available face databases, namely, ORL and FERET databases, are selected for evaluation. Compared with some LDA-based algorithms, experimental results exhibit that our GLDA approach gives superior performance...|$|E

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{property of}} codes, the second-order <b>weight</b> <b>distribution,</b> is proposed {{to solve the}} problems such as computing second moments of <b>weight</b> <b>distributions</b> of linear code ensembles. A series of results, parallel to those for <b>weight</b> <b>distributions,</b> is established for second-order <b>weight</b> <b>distributions.</b> In particular, an analogue of MacWilliams identities is proved. The second-order <b>weight</b> <b>distributions</b> of regular LDPC code ensembles are then computed. As easy consequences, the second moments of <b>weight</b> <b>distributions</b> of regular LDPC code ensembles are obtained. Furthermore, the application of second-order <b>weight</b> <b>distributions</b> in random coding approach is discussed. The second-order <b>weight</b> <b>distributions</b> of the ensembles generated by a so-called 2 -good random generator or parity-check matrix are computed, where a 2 -good random matrix is a kind of generalization of the uniformly distributed random matrix over a finite filed and is very useful for solving problems that involve pairwise or triple-wise properties of sequences. It is shown that the 2 -good property is reflected in the second-order <b>weight</b> <b>distribution,</b> which thus plays a fundamental role in some well-known problems in coding theory and combinatorics.

40|$|A social (sexual) {{network is}} modeled by an {{extension}} of the configuration model to the situation where edges have weights, e. g. reflecting the number of sex-contacts between the individuals. An epidemic model is defined on the network such that individuals are heterogeneous in terms of how susceptible and infectious they are. The basic reproduction number R 0 is derived and studied for various examples, but also the size and probability of a major outbreak. The qualitative conclusion is that R 0 gets larger as the community becomes more heterogeneous but that different heterogeneities (degree <b>distribution,</b> <b>weight,</b> susceptibility and infectivity) can sometimes have the cumulative effect of homogenizing the community, thus making R 0 smaller.

This paper presents the behavior of adhesively bonded joints subjected to combined thermal loadings, using the numerical methods.

40|$|Background {{subtraction}} models {{based on}} mixture of Gaussians have been extensively used for detecting objects in motion {{in a wide}} variety of computer vision applications. However, background subtraction modeling is still an open problem particularly in video scenes with drastic illumination changes and dynamic backgrounds (complex backgrounds). The purpose of the present work is focused on increasing the robustness of background subtraction models to complex environments. For this, we proposed the following enhancements: a) redefine the model distribution parameters involved in the detection of moving objects (<b>distribution</b> <b>weight,</b> mean and variance), b) improve pixel classification (background/foreground) and variable update mechanism by a new time-space dependent learning-rate parameter, and c) replace the pixel-based modeling currently used in the literature by a new space-time region-based model that eliminates the noise effect caused by drastic changes in illumination. Our proposed scheme can be implemented on any state of the art background subtraction scheme based on mixture of Gaussians to improve its resilient to complex backgrounds.

The new selective resin comprises of a mixture of two extractants, 4, 40 (50) -bis-t-butylcyclohexano- 18 -crown- 6 and di(2 -ethyl-hexyl) phosphoricacid, sorbed onto Amberchrom CG- 71. Sr uptake is shown to be high (the <b>distribution</b> <b>weight</b> coefficient Dw 4100 mL/g) {{across a range of}} environmentally realistic conditions (pH 2 – 8 and up to 11, 500 mg/L NaCl, 500 mg/L Ca, 400 mg/L K and 1300 mg/L Mg). The Sr capacity of the resin is shown to be 7. 7 +/- 0. 4 mg/g, meaning that the resin has a sufficient capacity to quantitatively remove Sr from most environmental water samples.

40|$|We {{evaluate}} in {{this work}} the hydrodynamic transport coefficients of a granular binary mixture in $d$ dimensions. In order to eliminate the observed disagreement (for strong dissipation) between computer simulations and previously calculated theoretical transport coefficients for a monocomponent gas, we obtain explicit expressions of the seven Navier-Stokes transport coefficients {{with the use of}} a new Sonine approach in the Chapman-Enskog theory. Our new approach consists in replacing, where appropriate in the Chapman-Enskog procedure, the Maxwell-Boltzmann <b>distribution</b> <b>weight</b> function (used in the standard first Sonine approximation) by the homogeneous cooling state distribution for each species. The rationale for doing this lies in the fact that, as it is well known, the non-Maxwellian contributions to the distribution function of the granular mixture become more important in the range of strong dissipation we are interested in. The form of the transport coefficients is quite common in both standard and modified Sonine approximations, the distinction appearing in the explicit form of the different collision frequencies associated with the transport coefficients. Additionally, we numerically solve by means of the direct simulation Monte Carlo method the inelastic Boltzmann equation to get the diffusion and the shear viscosity coefficients for two and three dimensions. As in the case of a monocomponent gas, the modified Sonine approximation improves the estimates of the standard one, showing again the reliability of this method at strong values of dissipation.
