25|$|Some of the {{passengers}} on board San Juan were able to jump onto {{the deck of the}} S.C.T. Dodd before the two ships drifted apart. Not long after the collision occurred, the lights went out on board the San Juan. While heading up to the San Juan's <b>deck,</b> <b>passenger</b> George Houghton, observed a group of distressed passengers by the main stairwell, shouting at each other and praying. Houghton compared the sight to Dante's Inferno. Shortly after the collision, the San Juan began to capsize on its port side and start sinking stern first. Wireless operator Clifford Paulson hurriedly returned to his room and began sending out distress signals. Soon after a single ship had replied, water rushed in through Paulson's door and completely flooded his room. Luckily, Paulson was able to escape.|$|E

60|$|So Rollo {{took the}} ticket {{and carried it}} to the Irishwoman. She {{was a woman who}} was {{returning}} to Ireland as a <b>deck</b> <b>passenger.</b> She was quite poor. When Rollo tendered her the ticket, she was, at first, much surprised. Rollo explained the case fully to her, and concluded by repeating Mr. Chauncy's advice--that she should sell the ticket, if she could get a chance to sell it for as much as two shillings. The woman, having been at sea before, understood something about such lotteries, and seemed to be quite pleased to get a ticket. She asked Rollo to tell such gentlemen as he might meet that she had 99 to sell for two shillings. This, however, Rollo did not like to do; and so he simply returned to the settee and reported to Mr. Chauncy that he had given the woman the ticket and delivered the message.|$|E

50|$|A lowbridge {{double-deck}} bus is a double-decker bus {{which has an}} asymmetric interior layout, enabling the overall height of the vehicle to be reduced {{compared to that of}} a conventional double-decker bus. The upper deck gangway is offset {{to one side of the}} vehicle, normally the offside (or driver's side), and is sunken into the lower <b>deck</b> <b>passenger</b> saloon. Low railway bridges and overpasses were the main reason that a reduced height was desired.|$|E
50|$|Previous to the Queen of the North disaster, crew {{quarters}} on both vessels {{were below}} the waterline, beneath the car <b>deck.</b> <b>Passenger</b> staterooms below the waterline {{had not been}} used {{for a number of}} years, but the crew's bunks and mess continued in use. Immediately after the sinking, however, the passenger cabins on Queen of Prince Ruperts Promenade deck were given over to the crew, greatly reducing the number of staterooms available to travellers, but ensuring the safety of the crew.|$|E
50|$|Although {{no clear}} {{end to the}} war was in sight, Partridge Wilson were already looking to a time when it would be over, and {{circulated}} a questionnaire to most of the larger seaside resorts in 1944, to gauge support for an idea that they were proposing. They suggested that fleets of battery-electric single <b>deck</b> <b>passenger</b> vehicles could be used to offer tourists the chance to go sightseeing or to tour the town in which they were staying. A number of positive responses were received, and it was suggested that the presence of such vehicles would promote the sales of electric goods vehicles.|$|E
50|$|When new, Rohna was {{certified}} to carry 5,064 <b>deck</b> <b>passengers.</b> In 1931 new regulations called the Simla Rules (superseded in 1948 by the SOLAS Convention) reduced this to 3,851, {{but this was}} still {{more than any other}} UK-registered ship.|$|R
50|$|Above two vehicle <b>decks,</b> <b>passenger</b> {{accommodation}} is {{over two}} main decks. To create {{an air of}} luxury, there was large scale use of mahogany and brass. Over the years, many refits and overhauls ensured that the ships remained very comfortable.|$|R

50|$|The same rail {{has been}} tested to 80 t axle {{loadings}} for mainline use, {{and can be used}} in tunnels and other locations where the loading gauge is restricted. Replacing flat bottom girder rails on sleepers and ballast with LR55 in tunnels can increase the head room by a minimum of 300 mm, without the need to excavate the tunnel invert. A method statement to undertake this transformation allows contractors to proceed on an incremental basis without closing the tunnel to rail traffic. Temporary transition rails link flat bottom and LR55 rails, until the conversion is completed. The extra loading gauge can then be used to install overhead electrification, or to move larger rail vehicles. These can include double <b>deck</b> <b>passenger</b> trains and freight trains with high cube (9 ft) maritime containers.|$|E

5000|$|Piloting captains have {{praised the}} {{seaworthiness}} {{of the small}} vessels, although they have also been called [...] "submarines" [...] due to their shape and their tendency to have waves crashing over their <b>decks.</b> <b>Passengers</b> were also said to appreciate the stability and safe travel of the vessels.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1970s, A Goninan & Co in Newcastle {{entered the}} {{passenger}} car construction market building 80 power cars C3001 - 3080 and 70 trailer cars T4101 - 4170. Unlike the Comeng cars, the power cars had a flat front end and Pullman Standard fluting, {{and the upper}} <b>deck</b> <b>passenger</b> windows were set {{significantly lower than the}} earlier Comeng cars reducing passenger sight lines (a source of complaint from passengers). When the Eastern Suburbs Railway was opened in 1979, only stainless-steel Comeng or Goninan double deck cars were meant to operate on this line, but the painted Tulloch double-deck trailers were also used. In 1981, a brand new four-car Goninan set conveyed Queen Elizabeth II from Bankstown (which was declared a City by the Queen) to Martin Place. For this occasion the train was specially fitted out with carpets and other refinements. The set was targeted [...] "R1" [...] for the occasion. These cars continue to operate in 2007 as L, R and S sets. They are the only non-air conditioned passenger trains in service in Sydney.|$|E
5000|$|The art {{direction}} {{team had}} to build all the interiors of the fictional E-474 from scratch, including the cockpit. The interior design and layout is similar to an actual airplane, the Airbus A380. It is noted {{that the amount of}} dead space within the cabin, cargo and avionic areas do not reflect the actual amount of dead space within any aircraft. Of special note in the movie is the avionics computer seen below the cockpit and the clean space between the upper <b>deck</b> <b>passenger</b> areas and the fuselage. To allow for varied camera angles, the set had many tracks for the camera dolly to move, and both the walls and the ceiling were built on hinges so they could easily be swung open for shooting. BE Aerospace provided various objects of the decoration. The design and colors tried to invoke the mood for each scene - for instance, a white room for [...] "eerie, clinical, cold" [...] moments, lower ceilings for claustrophobia, and wide open spaces to give no clues to the audience. Most exterior scenes of the plane involve a model with one tenth of the aircraft's actual size, with the images being subsequently enhanced through computer-generated imagery. The explosion in the nose involved both life sized and scaled pieces of scenery. A one-half scale set of the avionics area was constructed to make the explosion and fireball look bigger.|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s, tenders {{were called}} for {{double-deck}} electric passenger cars. In 1964, {{the first of}} 120 Tulloch trailers were delivered, and integrated into the single-deck sets. The cars were built by Tulloch Limited, and were numbered 4801-4920, by operating across only the City Circle, South, Bankstown, East Hills and Inner West Lines (Sector 2). They consisted of normal floor level over the bogies, with a double <b>deck</b> <b>passenger</b> section between the bogies. The cars were largely riveted aluminium, with steel underframes. They carried green internal livery and were painted Tuscan Red on the outside sides with painted silver roofs to match the single deck carriages. For {{the first time in}} Sydney, fluorescent internal lighting and air suspension bogies were used. The initial 40 cars were used in power door sets, the remainder in non-powered door sets, and they replaced the remaining wooden bodied trailer cars. In 1987, W-set trailers T4834-4838 were converted to manual door M-set cars by having their power-doors disconnected, and rewired from 120- to 32-volt operation. The Tullochs were painted in the colour scheme of the day (blue & white and later deep Indian red). Cars T4839 to 4895 were later painted grey and marshalled into sets containing Comeng & Goninan double-deck cars (see below) as 'R & S sets'. Cars T4834-4838 and 4896-4920 continued to operate with older single-deck motor cars as 'M Sets'. The W set trailers (T4801-4833) and M set trailers (T4834-4838 and 4896-4920) were withdrawn in 1994 with the retirement of all single deck suburban stock, the cars marshalled with Comeng power cars in W sets saw service until February 2004, before the introduction of the Millennium Trains. Cars 4801, 4814, 4840, 4843, 4844, 4849, 4850 4854, 4874, 4881, 4799 have been kept for preservation.|$|E

I would most gladly accept your invitation, but now is the busy mining season, and I have other and pressing duties that prevent, so that I must decline this opportunity of meeting my old friends in Otoe county-the best friends that man ever had.
