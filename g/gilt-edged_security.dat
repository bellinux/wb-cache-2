60|$|Honora {{found the}} {{compliment}} somewhat singular. But she {{was prepared to}} forgive New York a few sins {{in the matter of}} commercial slang: New York, which evidently dressed as it liked, and talked as it liked. But not knowing any more of a <b>gilt-edged</b> <b>security</b> than that it was something to Mr. Spence's taste, a retort was out of the question. Then, as though she were doomed that day to complicity, her eyes chanced to encounter an appealing glance from the Vicomte, who was searching with the courage of despair for an English word, which his hostess awaited in stoical silence. He was trying to give his impressions of Silverdale, in comparison to country places abroad, while Mrs. Robert regarded him enigmatically, and Susan sympathetically. Honora had an almost irresistible desire to laugh.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Gilt-edged</b> <b>securities</b> are bonds {{issued by}} some {{national}} governments. The term is of British origin, and then {{referred to the}} debt securities issued by the Bank of England on behalf of His/Her Majesty’s Treasury, whose paper certificates had a gilt (or gilded) edge. Hence, they are known as <b>gilt-edged</b> <b>securities,</b> or gilts for short. Today the term {{is used in the}} United Kingdom as well as some Commonwealth nations, such as South Africa and India. However, when reference is made to [...] "gilts", what is generally meant is UK gilts, unless otherwise specified.|$|R
50|$|The surplus is loaned to the {{government}} through the Debt Management Office, {{which is part of}} the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt, in Call Notice Deposits (previously invested in <b>gilt-edged</b> <b>securities)</b> and interest on these invested monies is paid to the NIF - £1.3 billion in the 2007/08 year.|$|R
50|$|A {{fiscal deficit}} is often funded by issuing bonds, like {{treasury}} bills or consols and <b>gilt-edged</b> <b>securities.</b> These pay interest, either for a fixed period or indefinitely. If {{the interest and}} capital requirements are too large, a nation may default on its debts, usually to foreign creditors. Public debt or borrowing refers to the government borrowing from the public.|$|R
25|$|Since 1998, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) {{has had the}} {{responsibility}} for setting the official interest rate. However, with the decision to grant the Bank operational independence, responsibility for government debt management was transferred in 1998 to the new Debt Management Office, which also took over government cash management in 2000. Computershare took over as the registrar for UK Government bonds (<b>gilt-edged</b> <b>securities</b> or gilts) from the Bank {{at the end of}} 2004.|$|R
6000|$|SIMONE. But {{what would}} be the use of my giving you swords and horses? You could never use them. Consider, my knight, my noble Sir Paul, in these days the {{contests}} of chivalry have assumed a different form; the weapons and the armour have changed. Your sword must be of gold and paper; your breastplate of hard cash; your charger of <b>gilt-edged</b> <b>securities.</b> I offer you the shining panoply of the modern crusader.

50|$|Typically, {{real rate}} swaps also come under this bracket, such as asset swaps of inflation-indexed bonds (government-issued inflation-indexed bonds, {{such as the}} Treasury Inflation Protected <b>Securities,</b> UK inflation-linked <b>gilt-edged</b> <b>securities</b> (ILGs), French OATeis, Italian BTPeis, German Bundeis and Japanese JGBis are {{prominent}} examples). Inflation swaps are the linear form of these derivatives. They can take a similar form to fixed versus floating interest rate swaps (which are the derivative form for fixed rate bonds), but use a real rate coupon versus floating, but also pay a redemption pickup at maturity (i.e., the derivative form of inflation-indexed bonds).|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} sectoral demand for U. K. <b>gilt-edged</b> <b>securities.</b> The Tobin-Markowitz model of {{portfolio}} choice generates the prediction that asset holdings should be negatively correlated with the own price, and positively correlated with the prices of major substitutes. In contrast, for all the five major groups of U. K. gilt holders, we find evidence consistent with a reverse correlation between the own price and market holdings which we argue arises due to the passive revaluation of existing holdings. We examine the empirical evidence using both cointegration analysis of stock holdings and a dynamic model of net transactions. Copyright 1994 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R
60|$|Hitherto {{there had}} been between these six {{brothers}} no more unfriendly feeling than that caused by the secret and natural doubt that the others might be richer than themselves; a feeling increased to the pitch of curiosity by the approach of death--that end of all handicaps--and the great 'closeness' of their man of business, who, with some sagacity, would profess to Nicholas ignorance of James' income, to James ignorance of old Jolyon's, to Jolyon ignorance of Roger's, to Roger ignorance of Swithin's, while to Swithin he would say most irritatingly that Nicholas must be a rich man. Timothy alone was exempt, being in <b>gilt-edged</b> <b>securities.</b>|$|R
40|$|Using {{retrospective}} data analysis, this paper {{looks at the}} potential effects that the EU financial transaction tax would have on registered Austrian funds. We use original data for 927 investment funds over a 12 -month trading period covering the 2014 calendar year. We analyse its effect on total net assets and on performance. We find {{that the cost of}} FTT on Austrian funds for 2014 would be Euro 89. 5 million. The effect of FTT differs between funds and is influenced by fund category, <b>gilt-edged</b> <b>securities</b> held, risk and investment strategy. Behavioural changes in the market would likely arise in these areas if FTT were to be introduced. (authors' abstract) Series: WU International Taxation Research Paper Serie...|$|R
5|$|M {{is another}} {{character}} {{who is more}} fully realised {{than in the previous}} novels, {{and for the first time}} in the series he is shown outside a work setting at the Blades club. It is never explained how he received or could afford his membership of the club, which had a restricted membership of only 200 gentlemen, all of whom had to show £100,000 in cash or <b>gilt-edged</b> <b>securities.</b> Amis, in his study The James Bond Dossier, considers that on M's salary his membership of the club would have been puzzling; Amis points out that in the 1963 book On Her Majesty's Secret Service it is revealed that M's pay as head of the Secret Service is £6,500 a year.|$|R
60|$|But he knew, also, how {{and when}} to give in. When he saw the wall shaking and {{crumbling}} irretrievably at a particular place, he patched it up with sops of cash from his three cash-earning companies. If the banks went, he went too. It was a case of their having to hold out. If they smashed and all the collateral they held of his was thrown on the chaotic market, it would be the end. And so it was, as the time passed, that on occasion his red motor-car carried, in addition to the daily cash, the most <b>gilt-edged</b> <b>securities</b> he possessed; namely, the Ferry Company, United Water and Consolidated Railways. But he did this reluctantly, fighting inch by inch.|$|R

The first set of [...] "narrow range" [...] investments included Defence Bonds, National Savings Certificates and similar [...] "small" [...] investments, which could be bought at a Post Office and did not require the trustee to seek advice before investing. The second set included debentures in certain British companies and <b>gilt-edged</b> <b>securities,</b> with the trustee expected to seek written advice from a person he believed was qualified to give it before investing. [...] "Wide range" [...] investments included unit trusts and shares in certain British companies, and shares in building societies.|$|R
50|$|Birkbeck Building and Freehold Land Society, {{formed in}} 1851, {{developed}} a large deposit-taking business that developed into banking activity. Cheque books were issued from 1858 and by 1872 {{the business was}} trading under the title of Birkbeck Bank. In 1910, when its balance sheet totalled £12.26 million and it had 112,817 accounts, the bank experienced a run. Continuing rumours about its financial position and a climate of depreciation in <b>gilt-edged</b> <b>securities,</b> led to a suspension of payments. The Bank of England provided support for the immediate payment of 10 shillings in the pound to depositors, but as most of its deposits were held as long-term securities the bank lacked liquidity and went into receivership. In 1911 its goodwill and premises were purchased from the receiver by London County and Westminster Bank.|$|R

Fellow Boston Elk lodge member and actor Nat Goodwin, a writer said around that time, [...] "repeatedly urged Kelly to abandon his diamond affiliations and embrace the fascinations of stage life, Goodwin {{claiming}} that Kelly is a natural born comedian." [...] Goodwin, a native of Boston, had been a founder of its Elks lodge in 1878. George W. Floyd, Goodwin's manager and a native of nearby Quincy, was also a charter member of the lodge {{and one of its}} early directors. Floyd was arguably the first player agent in baseball history. For example, in 1892, Floyd told the Chicago Herald that he had secured Kelly's new contract with Boston. It included a percentage of the club's earnings above $10,000. Floyd also said, [...] "Kelly is taking the best care of himself and is well fixed. The boodle money is in the shape of <b>gilt-edged</b> <b>securities</b> and 'mammy,' as Kel affectionately terms his wife, has charge of it." ...|$|R

40|$|Summary. This paper {{deals with}} pension fund {{investment}} in urban infrastructure projects. It {{is suggested that}} the potential returns (and risks) with such projects are signi ® cantly greater than comparable ® xed-income products though they have long gestation periods like <b>gilt-edged</b> <b>securities.</b> Our argument begins with unique evidence collected from an industry-sponsored research study of Australian infrastructure investment performance. Also analysed in a formal manner are the steps taken in evaluating urban infrastructure projects, ranging from roads and bridges through to hospitals and urban development. It is shown that, notwithstanding the uncertainty endemic to these kinds of project, a commonly desired form of ® nancial intermedia-tion is a formal contract binding the parties to one another {{over the long term}} (as much as 20 years or more). While no doubt valuable for many reasons, matching in effect the formal structure of some types of bond, it is suggested that these institutional structures can be more problematic than often appreciated once the world of short-term discrete contracts is left behind. At issue here is the management of contractual performance given that investment performance is a function of both the level of management resources (relative to capital investment) and the expertise of those who operate such facilities over the long term...|$|R
5000|$|Blades {{was founded}} between 1774 and 1776 and is of a calibre {{equal to or}} greater than that of any other club. In fact, Fleming writes that during Blades’s annual closings, its members have to “pig it” at the prestigious White’s or Boodle’s. [...] It excels in terms of member accommodations, staff, food, and furnishings, and its members include some of the finest card players in the world. The club has only 200 members, and there are only two {{qualifications}} for being elected a member: behaving like a gentleman and being able to “show” ₤100,000 (£ in [...] pounds) in cash or <b>gilt-edged</b> <b>securities.</b> M. is a member of Blades, and James Bond, though not a member, is an occasional guest. M. often lunches at Blades, usually eating a spare meal of grilled Dover sole and [...] "the ripest spoonful he could gouge from the club Stilton," [...] and always pays his bill with a five-pound note in order to receive newly minted notes and coins as change, a club tradition. As a favour to M., Blades also stocks a very bad Algerian red wine, to which he is partial, which he calls [...] "Infuriator", but the club refuses {{to put it on the}} wine list.|$|R

60|$|That chap, indeed, {{played a}} considerable, if invisible, part this summer--for {{he had not}} turned up again. Ever since the Sunday when Fleur had drawn {{attention}} to him prowling on the lawn, Soames had thought of him a good deal, and always in connection with Annette, for no reason, except that she was looking handsomer than for some time past. His possessive instinct, subtle, less formal, more elastic since the War, kept all misgiving underground. As one looks on some American river, quiet and pleasant, knowing that an alligator perhaps is lying in the mud with his snout just raised and indistinguishable from a snag of wood--so Soames looked on the river of his own existence, subconscious of Monsieur Profond, refusing to see more than the suspicion of his snout. He had at this epoch in his life practically all he wanted, and was as nearly happy as his nature would permit. His senses were at rest; his affections found all the vent they needed in his daughter; his collection was well known, his money well invested; his health excellent, save for a touch of liver now and again; {{he had not yet}} begun to worry seriously about what would happen after death, inclining to think that nothing would happen. He resembled one of his own <b>gilt-edged</b> <b>securities,</b> and to knock the gilt off by seeing anything he could avoid seeing would be, he felt instinctively, perverse and retrogressive. Those two crumpled rose-leaves, Fleur's caprice and Monsieur Profond's snout, would level away if he lay on them industriously.|$|R
