We have investigated the feasibility of a probe storage technique based on the interaction of a conductive tip with a phase-change (PC) medium. The electro-thermal writing process was modeled using the element method. The crystalline and the amorphous phases were taken into account as a possible initial state of the phase-change material. The analysis of the corresponding current flow and temperature distributions showed that the choice of the initial state of the PC material greatly influences the shape of the written dots, due to the important difference in the electrical properties of these two states. When introducing the kinetics of the phase-change process in the model, the simuation results indicated indeed, that the crystalline <b>dots</b> <b>spread</b> throught the thickness of the PC layer, whereas the amorphous dots are more localized {{at the top of the}} layer. One can then expect important effects on the readout process (and contrast) and the erasing mechanism, depending on the initial state of the storage medium...|$|R

40|$|The {{reduction}} of dot gain in half-tone printing is desirable {{in order to}} accurately reproduce designs in printed format. An important contribution to dot gain is the spreading of ink on the substrate after image formation but prior to immobilisation by curing or drying. The spreading of a typical screen ink was modelled to determine the thermodynamic processes controlling the rate of drop spreading and the timescales over which they are significant. Suggestions are offered as to the characteristics desirable in polymer substrates in order to minimise <b>dot</b> <b>spreading.</b> This study is original in that it derives from a modification of the approach taken by de Ruijters to the modelling of simple spherical drops. In this case a complex fluid is employed, namely a typical UV-curing ink, on four polymer surfaces. In this work the drops {{are considered to be}} driven towards their equilibrium geometry by a spreading force arising from surface tension effects. The spreading force is dissipated by the effects of viscous resistance to flow within the drop and molecular adhesion at the three-phase line. The model derived describes the rate of spreading in terms of three parameters, and once these parameters have been extracted results in being able to predict the extent of ink spreading and determine the rate of spreading. Although the study was carried out using screen inks it can be applied to most printing systems including ink–jet printing.

50|$|Screen {{frequency}} {{is determined}} by the type of paper the image is printed on. An absorbent paper surface, uncoated recycled paper for instance, lets ink droplets <b>spread</b> (<b>dot</b> gain)—so requires a more open printing screen. Input resolution can therefore be reduced to minimize file size without loss in quality, as long as the quality factor of 2 is maintained. This is easily determined by doubling the line frequency. For example, printing on an uncoated paper stock often limits printing screen frequency to no more than 120 lpi, therefore, a quality factor of 2 is achieved with images of 240 ppi.|$|R

30|$|The {{threshold}} PRE for ESF occurrence {{could be}} related to the occurrence probability of ESF in the following ways. If we {{take a closer look at}} the data in Fig.  2, <b>dots</b> (no <b>spread</b> F), plus signs (weak spread F), and circles (strong spread F) all exist within some small range of the PRE and solar flux (e.g., 10  m/s in the PRE drift and 50  units in the solar flux). In other words, ESF might occur or not occur in this range of the PRE and solar flux. In Fig.  3, especially the top row with more events, there is a trend that the cases with larger ESF occurrence index occur at higher PRE peak drift, implying that the PRE peak drifts (or the threshold drifts) are not exactly the same for the cases at different levels of the ESF occurrence index. The threshold PRE can be explained as that ESF almost certainly occurs if the PRE reaches the threshold. This is, in fact, equivalent to the statement that the occurrence probability of ESF is almost 100 % for this PRE value. The occurrence probability of ESF is nearly 100 % when the PRE peak drift is larger than 60  m/s in Fig.  7 b. These PRE values for near 100 % occurrence probability in Huang and Hairston (2015) are close to the threshold PRE (50 – 60  m/s) for ESF occurrence at high solar flux (Fejer et al. 1999).|$|R

40|$|The present {{knowledge}} society requires statistical literacy-the ability to interpret, critically evaluate, and communicate about statistical information and messages (Gal, 2002). However, {{research shows that}} students generally do not gain satisfactory statistical understanding. The research presented in this thesis is a sequel to design research carried out by Cobb, McClain, and Gravemeijer (2003) and aims at contributing to an empirically grounded instruction theory for early statistics education in which educational computer tools are used. Computer software allows users to dynamically interact with large data sets and to explore different representations {{in ways that are}} impossible by hand. The computer tools used were the Statistical Minitools (Cobb et al., 1997), which have been designed for middle school students. One important end goal of instruction was that students would gain understanding of sampling and learn to use 'shape' to reason about distributions. In line with the theory of Realistic Mathematics Education, a central tenet was that learning mathematics should be a meaningful activity. The research questions were: 1. How can students with little statistical background develop a notion of distribution? 2. How does the process of symbolizing evolve when students learn to reason about distribution? In the latter question, 'symbolizing' refers to the reflexive process of making symbols and mentally constructing the objects which they represent. The design research consisted of five cycles of three phases: a design phase, a teaching experiment, and a retrospective analysis. Prior to these cycles, historical and didactical phenomenological analyses (Freudenthal, 1991) were carried out as well as exploratory interviews. The historical study gave rise to hypotheses that were partially tested in the teaching experiments carried out in grades 7 and 8 (12 to 14 years old). In the design phase, a so-called hypothetical learning trajectory (Simon, 1995) was formulated, which was tested and revised in the subsequent cycles of design research. The recurring activity of discussing growing samples proved useful to support reasoning about distribution and sampling. For the analyses of students' learning, a method was used similar to the constant comparative method (Strauss & Corbin, 1998). It turned out that students conceived distributions as 'bumps' consisting {{of a small group of}} low values, a large group of 'average' values, and a small group of high values. Peirce's semiotics proved useful for analyzing students' process of symbolizing, in particular, his notions of hypostatic abstraction and diagrammatic reasoning. Hypostatic abstraction refers to the transition from a predicate to a new abstract object ("the <b>dots</b> are <b>spread</b> out" to "the spread is large"). Diagrammatic reasoning consists of three steps: making a diagram, experimenting with it, and reflecting on the results. The research shows the importance of letting students make their own diagrams and discussing these. The computer tools seemed most useful during the experimentation phase. Remarkably, the best diagrammatic reasoning occurred only during class discussions without computers around. One recommendation is: only invest in using computer tools if all educational factors such as teaching, end goals, instructional activities, tools, and assessment are tuned to each other...|$|R
