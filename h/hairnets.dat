Hatred between Tibeans and Muslims stems from events during the Muslim warlord Ma Bufang's rule in Qinghai such as Ngolok rebellions (1917–49) and the Sino-Tibetan War, but in 1949 the Communists {{put an end to}} the violence between Tibetans and Muslims, however, new Tibetan-Muslim violence broke out after China engaged in liberalization. Riots broke out between Muslims and Tibetans over incidents such as bones in soups and prices of balloons, and Tibetans accused Muslims of being cannibals who cooked humans in their soup and of contaminating food with urine. Tibetans attacked Muslim restaurants. Fires set by Tibetans which burned the apartments and shops of Muslims resulted in Muslim families being killed and wounded in the 2008 mid-March riots. Due to Tibetan violence against Muslims, the traditional Islamic white caps have not been worn by many Muslims. Scarfs were removed and replaced with <b>hairnets</b> by Muslim women in order to hide. Muslims prayed in secret at home when in August 2008 the Tibetans burned the Mosque. Incidents such as these which make Tibetans look bad on the international stage are covered up by the Tibetan exile community. The repression of Tibetan separatism by the Chinese government is supported by Hui Muslims. In addition, Chinese-speaking Hui have problems with Tibetan Hui (the Tibetan speaking Kache minority of Muslims).|$|E

50|$|<b>Hairnets</b> {{are part}} of normal attire for female horse riders and are worn in most equestrian disciplines, {{including}} dressage, eventing, show jumping, and hunting. Organizations such as the Pony Club encourage their young members to become accustomed to wearing <b>hairnets</b> when around horses, not only to ensure a neat and elegant appearance, but also to eliminate any danger of scalping should the rider fall off and the horse tread on loose hair.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hairnets</b> {{are used}} to prevent loose hair from contaminating food or work areas. A snood is a net or fabric bag pinned or tied on {{at the back of}} a woman's head for holding the hair.

50|$|These <b>hairnets</b> were {{frequently}} made of gold threads, sometimes of silk, or the Elean byssus, and probably of other materials, {{which are not}} mentioned by ancient writers.

50|$|There are a {{range of}} {{possible}} reasons for the objection to hair in food, ranging from cultural taboos to {{the simple fact that}} it is difficult to digest and unpleasant to eat.

5000|$|During {{the course}} of his cycling career, Shermer worked with cycling technologists in {{developing}} better products for the sport. During his association with Bell Helmets, a bicycle-race sponsor, Shermer advised them on design issues regarding their development of expanded-polystyrene for use in cycling helmets, which would absorb impact far better than the old leather [...] "hairnet" [...] helmets used by bicyclists for decades. Shermer advised them that if their helmets looked too much like motorcycle helmets, in which polystyrene was already being used, and not like the old <b>hairnet</b> helmets, no serious cyclists or amateur would use them. This suggestion led to their first model, the V1 Pro, which looked like a black leather <b>hairnet,</b> but functioned on the inside like a motorcycle helmet. In 1982, Shermer worked with Wayman Spence, whose small supply company, Spenco Medical, adapted the gel technology Spence developed for bedridden patients with pressure sores into cycling gloves and saddles to alleviate the carpal tunnel syndrome and saddle sores suffered by cyclists.|$|R

50|$|The Renaissance was {{a turning}} point for people's {{attitude}} regarding clothes and their appearance. People had a desire to wear tighter fitted clothes to emphasize body shape, particularly in men's clothing. Merchants expanded the market for items of clothing, creating accessories such as hats, <b>hairnets,</b> bags, or gloves. The spread of mirrors led to people becoming more interested in their self-image, and people were increasingly trying to look good and care about how they appeared to others.|$|E
50|$|The {{hair was}} often shaved above the oiled forehead. In the Hallstatt period, <b>hairnets</b> have been found; in some {{accounts}} individual emphasised braids (up to three) are mentioned, but most women tied their hair {{back in a}} braid.

Unlike married women, unmarried women usually wore the hair untied and without a headcovering.|$|E

5000|$|On {{the night}} before the wedding, the bride bound up her hair with a yellow <b>hairnet</b> she had woven. The {{confining}} of her hair signifies the harnessing of her sexuality within marriage. Her weaving of the tunica recta and the <b>hairnet</b> demonstrated her skill and her capacity for acting in the traditional matron's role as custos domi, [...] "guardian of the house." [...] On her wedding day, she belted her tunic with the cingulum, made from the wool of a ewe to symbolize fertility and tied with the [...] "knot of Hercules", which was supposed to be hard to untie. The knot symbolized wifely chastity, in that it was to be untied only by her husband, but the cingulum also symbolized that the bridegroom [...] "was belted and bound" [...] to his wife. The bride's hair was ritually styled in [...] "six tresses" [...] (seni crines), and she was veiled until uncovered by her husband {{at the end of the}} ceremony, a ritual of surrendering her virginity to him.|$|R
50|$|In the 21st century, a cholo is stereotypically male, {{depicted}} as wearing loose fitting khaki pants or shorts, with white knee-high socks, creased jeans, so-called wifebeater (white sleeveless athletic shirt), and button-front shirts, commonly plaid and flannel, often {{with just the}} top button buttoned. Cholos in the 1990s and 2000s frequently have their hair buzzed very short, though some continue to have the more traditional slicked-back hair, sometimes {{held in place by}} a <b>hairnet</b> or a bandana.|$|R
