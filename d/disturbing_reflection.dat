50|$|MIL-STD-1553B {{specifies}} {{that the}} longest stub length is 20 ft for transformer coupled stubs, {{but can be}} exceeded. With no stubs attached, the main bus looks like an infinite length transmission line with no <b>disturbing</b> <b>reflections.</b> When a stub is added, the bus is loaded and a mismatch occurs with resulting reflections. The degree of mismatch and signal distortion due to reflections are {{a function of the}} impedance presented by the stub and terminal input impedance. To minimize signal distortion, it is desirable that the stub maintain high impedance. This impedance is reflected back to the bus. At the same time, however, the impedance must be kept low so that adequate signal power will be delivered to the receiving end. Therefore, a tradeoff between these conflicting requirements is necessary to achieve the specified signal-to-noise ratio and system error rate performance (for more information, refer to MIL-HDBK-1553A).|$|R
40|$|In {{small-scale}} measurements, ground-penetrating radar (GPR) often uses {{a higher}} frequency {{to detect a}} small object or structural changes in the ground. GPR becomes {{more sensitive to the}} natural heterogeneity of the soil when a higher frequency is used. Soil heterogeneity scatters electromagnetic waves, and the scattered waves are in part observed as unwanted reflections that are often referred to as clutter. Data containing a great amount of clutter are difficult to analyze and interpret because clutter <b>disturbs</b> <b>reflections</b> from objects of interest. Therefore, modeling GPR clutter is useful to assess the effectiveness of GPR measurements. In this paper, the development of such a technique is discussed. This modeling technique requires the permittivity distribution of soil (or its geostatistical properties) and gives a nominal value of clutter power. The paper demonstrates the technique with the comparison to the data from a GPR time-lapse measurement.

40|$|Antireflection (AR) {{properties}} {{are required for}} optical surfaces to avoid <b>disturbing</b> <b>reflections</b> {{as well as to}} improve the transmission of optical systems. The common method to reduce the reflection on optics is vacuum deposition of interference coatings. However, special efforts are required for each type of plastic to develop polymer-capable vacuum coating processes due to the manifold chemical and physical properties of optical polymers. An alternative procedure for the antireflection of polymers is the generation of surface structures that decrease the index of refraction in a surface region. In this paper, the suitability of the miscellaneous thermoplastic polymers for plasma-ion assisted deposition processes is evaluated. This comprises the study of damage effects caused by the contact with plasma and high-energy radiation as well as the development of special coating designs and of suitable process conditions. Coating properties achieved are discussed for PMMA and poly-cycloolefines. The same ion source arrangement as used for coating has been applied for etching an antireflective sub-wavelength surface structure into PMMA. In summary, the paper shows the practical application fields for both technologies...|$|R

She was half-way down the long slope when a clash and tinkle reached her, and she noticed that a cloud of dust hung about the hollow where there had been another slough, which evidently had dried up weeks before. As men and horses were moving amid the dust she supposed that they were cutting prairie hay, which grows longer in such places than it does upon the levels. She went on another half-mile, and then sat down, for she had walked farther than she had intended to go. She could now see the men more clearly, and, though it was fiercely hot, they were evidently working at high pressure. Their blue duck clothing and bare brown arms appeared among the white and ocher tinting of the grass that seemed charged with brightness, and the sounds of their activity came up to her. She could distinguish the clashing tinkle of the mowers, the crackle of the harsh stems, and the rattle of wagon wheels.|$|R
40|$|Shallow, high {{resolution}} seismic reflection techniques detected the subsurface {{expression of a}} 40 ft wide and 30 ft deep sinkhole above DOE's Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) storage cavities at Weeks Island, Louisiana. The underground cavities that presently hold 73 million barrels of crude oil are two levels of a former room and pillar salt mine. The mine is within a salt dome that at the sinkhole is approximately 180 ft below the ground surface and responsible for the more than 125 ft of topographic uplift that produced Weeks Island. Four nominal 180 shot-point, 24 -fold P-wave CDP lines acquired with 8 ft station spacing possess inter-pretable reflections with an average dominant frequency of approximately 80 Hz and apparent NMO velocities ranging from 1350 to 2100 ft/sec.

40|$|The {{potential}} danger caused by glacier margin lakes {{and the related}} risk of glacier lake outburst floods (GLOF) increases constantly due to glaciers retreating {{in many parts of}} the world. Reasons for this development are on the one hand the new formation and enlargement of glacier margin lakes due to melt water. On the other hand, retreating and thinning glacier tongues lead to a decrease of the back pressure against the dammed glacier lakes. The paper describes the design of a photogrammetric GLOF monitoring system, based on monoscopic image sequence analysis for automatic detection of water level changes. The presented approach for measuring the water line in an image sequence is based on directional edge detection in LoG-filtered image data. After that, the water level is determined by a transformation of image measurements into object space based on orientation parameters of the camera and a geo-referenced lake basin model. The model can for instance be determined by photogrammetric methods after a GLOF; it may also be determined portion-wise by analysing shore lines at various water levels. Camera orientation parameters are determined by a local GPS-supported photogrammetric network. Comparing the determined water level changes with reference data provided by a water gauge, the precision is estimated in the order of one decimetre. A major challenge is the automatic detection of the water line in image sequences under varying light and visibility conditions. The paper will also discuss promising approaches such as multispectral images as well as a statistical analysis of grey value changes over short image sequences to eliminate <b>disturbing</b> <b>reflections</b> on the rough water surface...|$|R

40|$|Malting barley has {{to fulfil}} several quality demands {{to be fully}} accepted, and paid, by the malting industry. The {{cultivar}} has to be selected by the industry, {{the vitality of the}} lot has to be high, the husk has to be uninjured and the grain protein content has to be at the proper level and as even as possible. Flat protein levels are hard to achieve, as the grain protein over malting barley fields often vary 3 % around the field mean. The urge for even protein makes this crop a natural object for precision agriculture research, but surprisingly little has been reported. In the present project, precision agriculture methods have been used to monitor grain yield and grain protein of Swedish malting barley. The goal of the project has been, for spring sown Swedish malting barley, to understand the reasons for and patterns of the variability in grain protein, and design a method for fertilisation with a potential to produce more even protein with the proper mean level. It seems possible to design such a fertiliser system, provided that a restrained amount of compound NPKS fertiliser is combi-drilled at sowing and that the second fertiliser application as calcium nitrate is distributed, at the latest, at the two node stage of the barley. The second application needs the control from a remote sensor using an appropriate vegetation index. The most commonly used vegetation indices did not correlate well with the grain yield, or with the grain protein level at such an early stage, possibly because of <b>disturbing</b> <b>reflections</b> from the soil. However, a set of recently developed indices for maize did correlate with the patterns of both grain yield and grain protein. To get the mean values between years and places right, the regression algorithms also needed a measure of thermal stress during grain filling.

40|$|International audienceGuided {{waves are}} {{the major source of}} {{coherent}} noise, either on terrestrial or on marine seismic data, because the signals they produce are much stronger in amplitude than the reflected ones. In marine contexts, these waves exhibit characteristics that depend on the water depth, on the geometry and on the material properties of the substrata. Guided waves - or ground roll - are dispersive, which constitutes their main property. This means that each frequency component of the wave travels at a different velocity, in the sense that smaller and larger wavelengths are respectively influenced by the seismic properties of the shallower and deeper parts of the media. Due to their linear moveout-versus-offset characteristics, {{it may be possible to}} suppress the guided waves by dip filtering techniques. Unfortunately, this kind of filtering causes serious distortion of the signal when the amplitude of guided waves is much stronger than that of reflection (Liu 1999).

40|$|The {{concept of}} the BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Dis-tribution Function) is applied to analyze, {{characterize}} and understand the reflective properties of LCDs and their components in more detail. BRDFs are measured in the plane of light incidence with a goniometric apparatus ("in-plane BRDF") while the full 2 -dimensional BRDF is meas-ured with a conoscopic device. BRDF-curves of typical reflective LCDs clearly show the individual contributions of the first surface (unwanted reflections) and the compo-nent from the reflector, which is modulated by the LC-cell and is thus carrying the information to be displayed. The effect of anti-glare coatings on the front polarizer surface is analyzed via BRDF measurements.
