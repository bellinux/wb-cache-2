40|$|Abstract. <b>Double</b> <b>suction</b> {{centrifugal}} pumps are widely employed in large water supply projects. In the present study, a <b>double</b> <b>suction</b> centrifugal pump with the staggered arrangement impeller in a domestic water supply {{project has been}} mapping and modeling, and then the symmetrical arrangement impeller of a <b>double</b> <b>suction</b> centrifugal pump has been designed for comparison. The commercial code was used to investigate the pump efficiency and the time variation of pressure at the zone of volute tongue. This unsteady flow feature was investigated by the large eddy simulation (LES) method with the sliding mesh technology. The analysis indicated that the pump efficiency of the <b>double</b> <b>suction</b> centrifugal pump with staggered arrangement impeller is lower than that with the symmetrical one.

40|$|Abstract—An {{analysis}} is performed {{to study the}} influence of nonuniform <b>double</b> slot <b>suction</b> on a steady laminar boundary layer flow over a rotating sphere when fluid properties such as viscosity and Prandtl number are inverse linear functions of temperature. Nonsimilar solutions have been obtained from {{the starting point of}} the streamwise co-ordinate to the exact point of separation. The difficulties arising at the starting point of the streamwise co-ordinate, {{at the edges of the}} slot and at the point of separation have been overcome by applying an implicit finite difference scheme in combination with the quasi-linearization technique and an appropriate selection of the finer step sizes along the stream-wise direction. The present investigation shows that the point of ordinary separation can be delayed by nonuniform <b>double</b> slot <b>suction</b> if the mass transfer rate is increased and also if the slots are positioned further downstream. In addition, the investigation reveals that <b>double</b> slot <b>suction</b> is found to be more effective compared to a single slot suction in delaying ordinary separation.

40|$|Solar-powered {{water pumping}} is an {{inherently}} sensible proposition {{due to the}} pump being able to supply water at times when it is most in demand. In general small solar-thermal water pumps hold some promise for low technology applications in developing countries. The {{aim of this study}} was to model the characteristics of an appropriate technology water pump and build a concept-proving pump. A detailed computer model of the pump and flat plate collector gave the ability to optimise the pump's dimensions and predict the output for any average day in any location. An exergy analysis showed that the major losses in the system were due to wasteful processes within the pump's operating cycle. The pump took the form of a 450 mm diameter <b>double</b> diaphragm <b>suction</b> unit with a predicted operating efficiency of approximately 1 % when operating at 68 °C. The concept-proving pump was set up using compressed air and preliminary runs on pentane gave an efficiency of 0. 3 %.

A financial analysis highlighted the fact that the solar pump has higher capital but lower running costs than some of its competitors, and as such would suit certain niche applications.

To {{review the}} literature {{to establish the}} factors which have traditionally been regarded as most crucial {{to the design of}} effectlve exhaust ventilation systems. 2. To design, construct, install and calibrate a wind tunnel. 3. To develop procedures for air velocity measurement followed by a comprehensive programme of aerodvnamic data collection and data analysis for a variety of conditions. The major research findings were:- a) The literature in the subject is inadequate. There is a particular need for a much greater understanding of the aerodynamics of the suction flow field. b) The discrepancies between the experimentally observed centre-line velocities and those predicted by conventional formulae are unacceptably large. c) There was little agreement between theoretically calculated and observed velocities in the suction zone of captor hoods. d) Improved empirical formulae for the prediction of centre-line velocity applicable to the classical geometrically shaped suction openings and the flanged condition could be (and were) derived. Further analysis of data revealed that: - i) Point velocity is directly proportional to the suction. flow rate and the ratio of the point velocity to the average face velocity is constant. ii) Both shape, and size of the suction opening are significant factors as the coordinates of their points govern the extent of the effect of the suction flow field. iii) The hypothetical ellipsoidal potential function and hyperbolic streamlines were found experimentally to be correct. iv) The effect of guide plates depends on the size, shape and the angle of fitting. The effect was to very approximately <b>double</b> the <b>suction</b> velocity but the exact effect is difficult to predict. v) The axially symmetric openings produce practically symmetric flow fields.

Cavitation normally occurs when liquid at a constant temperature is subjected to vapor pressure either by static or dynamic means. If the local pressure somewhere in the fluid drops to or below vapor pressure and nuclei are present, vapor cavities can be formed. As long as the local pressure stays at vapor pressure and cavity has reached a critical diameter, it will continue to grow rapidly.

The high silt concentration around the impeller ring is the major contributor to silt abrasion of the ring. Back-blade and J-groove configurations are effective in reducing the silt concen-tration around the ring but extra friction loss is also introduced and the pump efficiency is decreased. Optimization of the length, position and number of back-blades, and the shape and number of J-grooves, decreases losses in pump efficiency and effectively protects the impeller ring.

The largest pressure fluctuations on the diffuser vanes and the impeller blades were found to be of the same order of magnitude as the total pressure rise across the pump. On the diffuser vanes, the largest pressure fluctuations were observed on the suction side of the vane near the leading edge, whereas on the impeller blades the largest fluctuations occurred at the blade trailing edge.

Although these pumps met performance specifications {{on the test}} stand, they proved to be noisy when installed. Sound power levels greater than 93 dbA were observed. Pumping applications involving cooling water have been especially difficult to solve over the tears, due {{to the presence of}} dissolved air inherent in a cooling tower sump. Water that contains large amounts of dissolved air changes the apparent required net positive suction head (NPSH). In such applications, traditional correction techniques failed because the entire system was not analyzed, and the source of the noise generation could not be pinpointed. This paper deals with the steps involved with obtaining a solution to this problem. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis was performed on the pump and impeller. Initial investigation revealed that the impeller was not the source of the problem. The casing inlet was then analyzed. The model indicated the presence of separation in the suction nozzle, causing a flow distortion at the impeller eye. A unique guide ring was developed to minimize the flow separation. The CFD analysis was revised to reflect the new geometry, and a significant improvement in the flow was predicted. A prototype guide ring was manufactured and installed in one of the four pumps.

New impeller designs were tested in a full scale model test pump running at reduced speed, which was equipped with an acrylic viewing window for direct observation of the impeller blade cavitation.

Compared with the original design, in which impellers were replaced/repaired after less than one year of operation, the new impeller lifetime was calculated to be improved by at least a factor of eight, on the basis of cavitation bubble length.

A successful hydraulic rerate of these pumps, which required minimal modifications {{to their original}} pump casings and no modifications to the piping, drivers, or baseplates, dramatically improve their reliability and reduced annual repair costs. The first case study describes the rerate of a 4 X 6 X 13, 3560 rpm, 300 hp, single suction overhung pump and its spare, which were averaging between seven and 12 failures per year from 1990 to 1995.

In the light of their experience, the authors conclude that percutaneous aspiration may be a safe option in managing of mediastinal and pulmonary hydatid cyst in agreement with our experience 2. However, in our paper we clarify that surgical intervention is still the main modality for the treatment of hydatid disease especially in presence of giant cyst (> 10 cm) 3. Thus, we present a novel technique that allows the aspiration of a cyst during surgical resection of hydatid cyst {{in order to reduce the}} risk of anaphylaxis and dissemination of disease due to enucleation or simple needle aspiration. This is a homemade <b>double</b> <b>suction</b> device designed to aspirate hydatid cysts by creating a low pressure, wide mouth cylinder which holds the cyst wall against the base of the cylinder. A large thoracentesis needle is inserted across the low pressure chamber into the cyst to aspirate the fluid within. The complete evacuation of the cyst makes surgical treatment easier and facilitates its successive removal. Thus, the home device reported above is designed for surgical treatment of hydatid cyst via thoracotomy, but a homemade device for percutaneous aspiration is not yet born!

40|$|Lecturepg. 13 Following a brief {{description}} of the general suction performance of pumps and starting from an impeller designed for standard requirements, it will be discussed by which modifications and up to which limit the suction performance can be improved. In this context, it will be shown that the well-known measures ? e. g., enlargement of the impeller inlet diameter, reduction of the vane number or installation of an inducer ? may result in some restrictions concerning the possible operational range and may pose a risk of cavitation erosion. These undesirable consequences can, however, be avoided or at least moderated by modifications upstream of the impeller. The suction performance can also be improved by using <b>double</b> <b>suction</b> instead of single suction pumps. It is explained why the resulting improvement may not be as substantial as could be assumed at a first glace. Pumps with inlet velocities exceeding 25 to 30 m/s that are expected to run for 10, 000 hr and more without cavitation damage cannot operate at NPSH values corresponding to a 3. 0 percent head drop, even if a highly cavitation-resistant material is used. It is demonstrated that the design parameters of their impellers differ from those used for ?normal? impellers. If NPSHA is not sufficient, a booster pump has to be provided, or the rotational speed has to be reduced. As the latter is an expensive alternative, the question arises what the minimum booster pump head is. Some information regarding this issue is given. It will also be demonstrated that there is an upper limit of the rotational speed of the main pump beyond which can economical solution is impossible...|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} between impeller blades and diffuser vanes in diffuser pumps was investigated. Steady and unsteady pressure measurements {{were made on}} the diffuser vanes and on the front shroud wall of a vaned and a vaneless diffuser. Two different impellers were used, {{one half of the}} impeller of the <b>double</b> <b>suction</b> pump of the HPOTP (High Pressure Oxygen Turbopump) of the SSME (Space Shuttle Main Engine), and a two-dimensional impeller. The measurements were made for different flow coefficients, shaft speeds, and radial gaps between the impeller blades and the diffuser vanes (1. 5 % and 4. 5 % of the impeller discharge radius for the impeller of the HPOTP, and 5 % and 8 % for the two-dimensional impeller). The vane pressure fluctuations were larger on the vane suction than on the vane pressure side attaining their maximum value, of the same order of magnitude as the total pressure rise across the pump, near the leading edge. The resulting lift on the vane, both steady and unsteady, was computed from the pressure measurements at mid vane height. The magnitude of the fluctuating lift was found to be larger than the steady lift. For the impeller of the HPOTP, pressure measurements on the front shroud of a vaned and a vaneless diffuser showed that the front shroud pressure fluctuations increased with the presence of the diffuser vanes. For the two-dimensional impeller, also unsteady impeller blade pressure measurements were made. The largest blade pressure fluctuations, of the same magnitude as the large pressure fluctuations on the vane suction side, occurred at the blade trailing edge. However, the dependence of those pressure fluctuations on the flow coefficient was found to be different; on the vane suction side, the fluctuations were largest for maximum flow and decreased with decreasing flow coefficient, whereas at the blade trailing edge, the fluctuations were smallest for maximum flow and increased with decreasing flow coefficient. Increasing the vane number resulted in a significant decrease of the blade pressure fluctuations. Lift, vane and blade pressure, and front shroud pressure fluctuations decreased strongly with increasing radial gap...|$|E
40|$|The drag {{developed}} on an object {{as it moves}} through a fluid comprises {{of a number of}} components arising from various and differing fluid phenomena. For aerodynamic bodies such as aircraft, one of the most dominant components of the total drag force is that arising from shear interactions between the surface of the object and the fluid. In steady, cruise conditions this shear-induced skin friction drag can account for almost 50 % of the total drag force on the body and hence this is the reason much interest surrounds the minimisation of this component. Laminar Flow Control (LFC) is the field of aerodynamics focused on minimising skin friction, or viscous drag. The viscosity of a fluid, and the shear interactions between the layers of fluid and the aerodynamic body give rise to a boundary layer, a region of fluid with diminished fluid velocity and momentum. Laminar Flow Control aims to minimise the momentum deficit within the boundary layer by manipulating the flow within and encouraging favourable flow conditions to exist and be maintained. In essence, Laminar Flow Control attempts to maintain laminar flow within the boundary layer, improving the stability of the flow, delaying the onset of turbulence and the formation of a turbulent boundary layer that develops significantly more drag than an equivalent laminar structure. A number of techniques exist for controlling and maintaining laminar flow within a boundary layer. Examples include compliant surfaces, acoustic arrays and suction, and all share the common trait of complexity, which to date has limited the application of such systems in the real world. In the search for simpler Laminar Flow Control technology, attention has been turned towards Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) plasma actuators as a possible alternative. Through the formation of a small volume of plasma, these actuators are capable of producing an electrostatic body force that can couple with the surrounding air and bring about a jetting effect without the addition of mass. This jetting effect, if controlled effectively, can potentially favourably augment a boundary layer flow and lead to a delay in transition. The work discussed in this thesis represents a contribution to the field of DBD-based Laminar Flow Control. The aim was to further investigate the potential of plasma actuators for improving the hydrodynamic stability of a boundary layer and hence contribute to the limited published data pertaining to this field. The research involved the development of a DBD-based LFC system in which plasma actuators were used to augment the most fundamental of boundary layer flows, the flat plate, Blasius-type. By measuring the augmentation to the velocity profile of the boundary layer brought about by the LFC system, the stability of the flow was able to be investigated and hence the feasibility of the technology determined. The plasma actuators utilised in this research were designed such that control could be achieved over the shape of the induced jetting profile. To minimise adverse interactions with boundary layer flows, the plasma actuators were designed so that the magnitude and position of the maximal induced jetting velocity could be controlled. After consultation of the literature, novel actuators utilising orthogonally arranged electrodes were conceived and tested in a parametric study. Through variation of the distance to which the exposed electrode sat proud above the surface of the actuator, in addition to variation of the applied voltage, {{it was found that the}} desired control over the induced jet could be attained, leading to the identification of two mechanisms through which the DBD-based LFC system could be tuned. The details of the design and development of these orthogonal actuators and the effect of the electrode height on the jetting characteristics of the devices can be found in Gibson et al. (2009 a) and Gibson et al. (2009 b). After identifying suitable and novel actuator arrangements, a tuning strategy was conceived to hasten the development of the LFC system. Rather than implementing the actuators and measuring the response of the boundary layer to the plasma first, Linear Stability Theory was instead used to identify desirable boundary layer augmentation objectives for the LFC system. Linear Stability Analyses (LSAs) were performed on a number of idealised boundary layer flows, obtained from curve fitting analytical functions to published DBDaugmented boundary layer data, as well as from boundary layer theory. The LSAs were conducted using an Orr-Sommerfeld Equation solver developed as part of this research, which utilises a finite differencing scheme. The outcome of this comparison process was that the developed DBD-based LFC system was used to attempt to augment the boundary layer such that the flow attained an asymptotic suction velocity profile, which would give the boundary layer a limit of stability almost two orders of magnitude greater than that of the base flow, and hence significant robustness to transition. The conceived DBD-based LFC system was implemented into a Blasiusv type boundary layer which was formed over the Flat Plate Rig (FPR) designed and developed as part of this research. Initially a single actuator was utilised, positioned just upstream of the location of the critical Reynolds Number (limit of stability) of the flow. Due to the design of the FPR and the actuators utilised, it was possible to study the response of the layer to the plasma with and without a mild suction effect, introduced through a 5 mm wide slot that was required for operation of the actuator. This mild suction effect was measured to be approximately 4 Pa, and by itself was found to be insufficiently strong enough to augment the flow such that it attained the characteristics of a boundary layer with uniform wall suction. With the FPR, measurements of the velocity profile of the boundary layer with and without flow control were made around the critical Reynolds Number location of the flow (80000 < Rex < 120000), which allowed the changes to the stability of the flow to be studied. As discussed in Gibson et al. (2012) the initial results of the DBD-based LFC system showed that the plasma was adversely affecting the stability of the flow. Subsequent tuning of the system was therefore performed through variation of the applied voltage of the actuator. From this tuning it was found that an actuator operated with an applied voltage of 19. 0 kVpp (referred to as a low-voltage actuator) in conjunction with the mild suction effect, produced boundary layer characteristics akin to those of a flow exposed to uniform wall suction. In addition, an actuator operated with an applied voltage of 21. 4 kVpp (referred to as a high-voltage actuator) was found to adversely affect the stability, even more so in the absence of the mild suction effect. The single low-voltage actuator was found to be able to maintain uniform wall suction-like characteristics for 50 mm beyond the trailing edge of the encapsulated electrode. This finding pertaining to the use of the low-voltage actuator highlighted the potential of a single DBD device to develop uniform wall suction-like characteristics with only a mild suction effect through a single slot, and hence in a less complex fashion than conventional suction systems. An attempt was made to maintain the favourable benefits of the single, low-voltage actuator by using two such actuators placed in series. However, the effect of this combined double-actuator/suction system differed only slightly from the suction-only system (with two slots instead of one), meaning that in this configuration, the use of the plasma was somewhat superfluous. Hence it could be concluded from the results of the research that a single low-voltage actuator operated in conjunction with a mild suction effect is more effective as a LFC system than a single mild-suction slot, but a combined double-low-voltage actuator/suction system is no better than a simpler and less energy consuming double-mild-suction slot system. It is, however, anticipated that through the undertaking of future works, utilising additional actuators that have undergone further tuning, a LFC even more effective than the <b>double</b> <b>suction</b> slot system tested in this research will ultimately be developed.
