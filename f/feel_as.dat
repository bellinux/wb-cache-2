5|$|The role of stay-at-home dad may be {{difficult}} for men who <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> though they had no option. It is hard for these men to adapt from being a financial provider in the family to being a homemaker. Men who willingly choose to become a stay-at-home dad are much more satisfied with their role in the family.|$|E
5|$|We all <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> {{sensitive}} to satisfaction at times. We can look outside us and {{see nothing but}} destruction, avarice, and boredom. So we look to find that love where we can find it. Some people look to Hollywood, some people look to Blackpool and {{the bright lights of}} Blackpool. That's probably where I would look.|$|E

With a c 2 chosen sufficiently small, Helbing’s observed increase of crowd pressure, could lift M to values that could never be reached by density alone.|$|R
5|$|Guitar Hero Backstage Pass {{was also}} praised for the {{addition}} of role-playing elements and smaller minigames to bring the series in line with other mobile phone games. The mini-games were said to help build up the anticipation of the performance element of the game, making these <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> necessary elements of the player's band's career progression. The game won the 2009 Webby Award for Best Mobile Gaming application.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor and Clara find a {{location}} in the mansion which is noticeably colder {{than the rest of}} the house, and they <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> if they are being watched. Suddenly the house grows cold and Clara feels something holding her hand when there's nothing there. The two race back to where the Professor and Emma are waiting to see Palmer's equipment activating of its own accord. A thin black disc materializes in front of them and Emma senses something crying out for help as the ghost appears in a dark hallway crying for help. The Doctor quickly takes pictures of them before the disc vanishes and the house returns to normal.|$|E
5|$|The {{lighting}} system is programmed to darken the set as the contestant progresses {{further into the}} game. There are also spotlights situated {{at the bottom of}} the set area that zoom down on the contestant when they answer a major question; to increase the visibility of the light beams emitted by such spotlights, oil is vaporized, creating a haze effect. Media scholar Dr. Robert Thompson, a professor at Syracuse University, stated that the show's {{lighting system}} made the contestant <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> though they were outside of prison when an escape was in progress.|$|E

5|$|The {{story of}} Christmas Nights follows Elliot and Claris {{during the holiday}} season {{following}} their adventures with Nights. Though they both enjoy the Christmas season, they <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> if something is missing. Realising that the Christmas Star that usually sits {{at the top of the}} Twin Seeds Christmas tree is absent, the pair travel to Nightopia to find it. There, they reunite with Nights and re-explore Spring Valley, which has now been decorated due to their dreams of the holiday season. The remainder of the story revolves around their attempts of defeating a revived Gillwing and retrieving the Christmas Star from his lair.|$|E
5|$|To {{develop the}} game's overall aesthetic, the main {{aim was to}} create designs that would combine comic book style with realism. The {{environmental}} architecture and characters had to be extravagant enough to represent the Batman universe, but needed realistic texture and detail. The second aim was to recreate the dark, Gothic imagery inherent to the Batman universe, especially Arkham Asylum, so that the structure would <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> insane as those whom it houses. The asylum was considered an ideal location because it can house many of Batman's foes.|$|E
5|$|Cuarón {{wanted to}} do {{tracking}} shots, {{in part because the}} producers wanted to film it like an IMAX-style Discovery Channel documentary. Like his previous films, Emmanuel Lubezki did not use prior footage as the starting point of his work on Gravity. Instead, he carried out a search of images from NASA and Roscosmos. He and his team put together a large collection of photographs and picked what was best for the movie. Lubezki said that they based the visuals on descriptions from astronauts, with some artistic license in depicting how the stars looked during the daytime in space. He wanted to incorporate the stars as much as possible to <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> deep as possible and avoid plain darkness and two dimensional feeling.|$|E

5|$|Filming was set {{to begin}} in October 2003, but it was pushed back. Principal {{photography}} for Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events began on November 10, 2003, using the sound stages and backlot at Paramount Studios in Hollywood. Director Brad Silberling avoided using too many digital or chroma key effects because he wanted the younger actors to <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> if they were working in a realistic environment. Olaf's mansion occupied two sound stages, while the graveyard and {{the ruins of the}} Baudelaire mansion were constructed on the Paramount back lot. After 21 weeks of shooting at Paramount, production then moved to Downey Studios, a former NASA facility in Downey, California, for eight more weeks. Downey housed the circular railroad crossing set complete with forced perspective scenery, as well as a newly constructed water tank complete with over one million gallons of water. The water tank was instrumental in filming scenes set at Briny Beach, Lake Lachrymose, Damocles Dock and Curdled Cave. Filming for A Series of Unfortunate Events ended on May 29, 2004.|$|E
5|$|Fourth-place {{finisher}} Hamilton said it {{had been}} a tough race for him because his car did not <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> good as he hoped. He had also hoped the gap would be closer than it was in qualifying. Webber stated that he enjoyed {{the first part of the}} event and was looking forward to the next race of the season. Kovalainen was issued with an reprimand for his role in the collision with de la Rosa. He admitted that he was at fault for causing the incident because he was allowing another car to pass him and had not seen de la Rosa approaching him. Force India's chief operating officer Otmar Szafnauer said the confusion resulting in the error of fitting the wrong tyres for both their drivers was an example of cause and effect. He wanted to disregard the issue and look forward to the next few races. The team received a warning from the stewards and avoided disqualification because they had recognised their mistake immediately.|$|E
5|$|Gouty {{patients}} are, generally, either old men or men {{who have}} so worn themselves out in youth as to have brought on a premature old age—of such dissolute habits none being more common than the premature and excessive indulgence in venery and the like exhausting passions. The victim goes to bed and sleeps in good health. About {{two o'clock in the}} morning he is awakened by a severe pain in the great toe; more rarely in the heel, ankle or instep. The pain is like that of a dislocation and yet parts <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> if cold water were poured over them. Then follows chills and shivers and a little fever... The night is passed in torture, sleeplessness, turning the part affected and perpetual change of posture; the tossing about of body being as incessant as the pain of the tortured joint and being worse as the fit comes on.|$|E

5|$|Titan Quest was {{envisioned by}} game {{designer}} Brian Sullivan as a role-playing game set in Ancient Greece similar to Age of Empires. Production began in 2004 after a successful pitch to THQ. The script {{was written by}} Randall Wallace, while Sullivan acted as the designer. Despite being in a mythical setting, the team {{wanted to make the}} environments and towns <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> realistic as possible, leading to a large amount of research into ancient cultures. Enemies were inspired by the game's regional mythologies, with designs inspired by the stop-motion work of Ray Harryhausen. The music, composed by Scott Morton and Michael Verrette, was created to avoid the looping tracks of other games.|$|E
5|$|Lindsey later {{reveals that}} she is {{pregnant}} with Joe's baby. Joe admits this but tells Mercedes he still {{wants to be with}} her. Mercedes believes him, however Lindsey makes Mercedes <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> though she is interrupting on a perfect family with her and Joe. Mercedes then breaks up with Joe, and leaves the village. She returns two months later, and is shocked to learn that Lindsey's younger sister, Kim Butterfield (Daisy Wood-Davis), has been imprisoned for killing seven patients at the local hospital. Kim's ex-girlfriend, Esther Bloom (Jazmine Franks) and herself a victim of the killer when they tried to murder her, attempts to convince Mercedes of Kim's innocence. Mercedes and Esther realise that Lindsey is the serial killer after discovering Lindsey's earring is matching to the earring which was dropped when Esther was attacked. Mercedes confronts Lindsey but she denies this. Lindsey writes a fake letter pretending to be Kim admitting to be the serial killer and telling Esther to leave her alone. Mercedes sees the letter which has doodles on it, and when she is alone with Cindy and Lindsey, she realises that the doodles are the same as those in Lindsey's notebook. Her and Cindy realise that Lindsey is the serial killer and confront her. Lindsey confesses to the murders and attempted murders, and then strikes both Mercedes and Cindy with a large book, knocking them unconscious. She then escapes the village. Mercedes is desperate for Lindsey to be caught and for Joe's baby son, JJ, not be abducted, and moves back in with Joe and Freddie. When Silas hears about what Lindsey's murders, he returns to the village and begins working with Lindsey. Silas plans to finally kill Mercedes, however Mercedes convinces Silas to kill Lindsey instead, informing him of her sinful ways. Her plan works and Silas murders Lindsey instead and Mercedes manages to escape.|$|E
25|$|Overall a {{majority}} of military brats report having developed a kind of extra-adaptability and assimilate into new situations quickly and well, as they have done with each {{move to a new}} military base, town or country. Yet paradoxically, long-term feelings of being an outsider in relation to civilian (non-military) culture are common to {{a majority}} of military brats. For example, one major study shows that 32% of military brats <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> if they are only spectators on U.S. life, and another 48% do not <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> if they are central to any group.|$|E
