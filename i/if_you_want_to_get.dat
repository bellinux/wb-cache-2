In 2013, Jaime Dunkle of the Daily Vanguard, Portland State University's student newspaper, included Starky's {{as one of the}} [...] "Top 5 Gay Clubs/Bars in Portland," [...] writing: [...] "For maxing and relaxing: Starky's is the best outdoor gay bar. Word on the street is that they make a killer Bloody Mary and have a yummy brunch menu. They're old school and have been in Portland since 1984. Check it out <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away from the throbbing, meat-market discos." [...] In 2014, GoLocalPDX contributor Byron Beck included Starky's in his list of the [...] "Top 12 Gay Clubs in Portland", writing: [...] "Starky's is for those who remember that brunch is best served on Sunday with a Bloody Mary. This true original is more restaurant than bar but that doesn't stop people from coming here for some of the stiffest drinks in town." [...] In 2015, Willamette Week contributors included Starky's in their list of favorite Portland gay bars.|$|E
500|$|Paul {{built the}} members a cabana style house on his pool deck with air conditioning, a TV, and beds so the members felt {{comfortable}} while recording. Paul produced {{the record and}} Gray felt Paul [...] "facilitated the whole thing". The album was completed in roughly a month, with three recording sessions. The band worked on the record for eight days and returned home for a break. A 14-day session, followed the break and then another 10 days in the studio. Gray asserts the breaks in between recording sessions were to [...] "re charge the batteries", and [...] "get a fresh head". As the line-up was complete, the band started to brainstorm names. When a member thought of a name they would write it {{on a piece of}} paper and put it in an amp box outside the studio. Someone wrote [...] "Hellyeah", and the band thought it was a perfect choice. Paul says it's [...] "very affirmative and full of attitude. When your buddy asks <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a beer tonight, you don't just say 'yes,' you say, [...] "Hell yeah!". Gray attributes the name to [...] "late teens, keggers and chicks and AC/DC and Metallica".|$|E

You can go into the green zone if they let you, but DO NOT go into the red zone.'" [...] He said that they [...] "were {{absolutely}} sure we would never get past the first checkpoint. It was panic stations when we realised", adding that it was a [...] "stupid gag that backfired". Morrow said that the purpose of the stunt was [...] "an attempt to satirise in a silly way the very heavy security and the spin surrounding that security, it was a test of the old adage that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> in somewhere the best way is right through the front door. I didn't want the stunt to happen in a way that resulted in people getting arrested. If we've made a mistake and crossed into the green zone, I'm very regretful about that." [...] He said the only reason they impersonated bin Laden was because they needed a joke to get out of the stunt that they always assumed would never have passed security.|$|E

2500|$|Hayden kept a {{considerably}} lower national profile than conventional wisdom would suggest {{for someone who}} spent {{more than half a}} century in Washington, including 42 years in the Senate. This came in part due to a conversation he had with Maryland Congressman Fred Talbott soon after he arrived in Washington in 1912. Talbott told him, [...] "Son, there are two kinds of Congressmen—show horses and work horses. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> your name in the papers, be a show horse.

[...] In the second stanza he is saying that I am nowhere close to good enough for you, but maybe you {{are not aware of}} it. [...] And in the third stanza he is saying you are too good for me, but maybe you didn't realize that before. [...] In the closing couplet, Shakespeare confesses that no matter what the cause of misjudgment, you're released by the mistake, and [...] "I'm left here to remember our time together" [...] when I felt like nobility.|$|E

[...] Writer Theodore Sturgeon reported that Hubbard made a similar statement at the Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society. Likewise, writer Sam Moskowitz reported in an affidavit that during an Eastern Science Fiction Association meeting on November 11, 1948, Hubbard had said [...] "You don't get rich writing science fiction. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rich, you start a religion." [...] Milton A. Rothman also reported to his son Tony Rothman that he heard Hubbard make exactly that claim at a science fiction convention.
