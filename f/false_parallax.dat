The scheme of the size of the image in pixels can be according to the grey value of the absolute difference and change. If a image block grey value of the absolute difference than the threshold value, the piece may need to be divided into four 4 x 4 sub-block. If less than threshold, is not divided. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is effective, this article puts forward a coding scheme to promote the application of three-dimensional images is of great significance...|$|E

(The true value of this angle is close to 89° 50', and the Sun's distance is actually about 400 times the Moon's.) The implicit <b>false</b> solar <b>parallax</b> of slightly under 3° was used by astronomers {{up to and including}} Tycho Brahe, c. AD 1600. Aristarchus pointed out that the Moon and Sun have nearly equal apparent angular sizes, and therefore their diameters must be in proportion to their distances from Earth; thus, the diameter of the Sun was calculated to be between 18 and 20 times the diameter of the Moon.|$|R
