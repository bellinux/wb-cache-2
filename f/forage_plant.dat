Alfalfa usually has the highest feeding value of all common hay crops. It is used less frequently as pasture. When grown on soils where it is well-adapted, alfalfa is often the highest-yielding <b>forage</b> <b>plant,</b> but its primary benefit is the combination of high yield per hectare and high nutritional quality.|$|E

(2) The combination of large K and low F suggested the canopy leaves showing a horizontal inclination. (3) The small K and high F suggested the canopy leaves showing a vertical inclination. (4) These phenomena depended on the leaf inclination angle with which upper leaves shaded lower leaves, provided that other factors were the same. Therefore, the case (3) might give the canopy structure that was higher in the production of <b>forage</b> <b>plants</b> compared with the case (2).

Twentieth Century changes in range and frequency of these <b>forage</b> <b>plants</b> were assessed using data from the New Atlas of the British and Irish Flora (1930 – 1969 to 1987 – 1999) and the Countryside Surveys of Britain (1978 – 1998). <b>Forage</b> <b>plants</b> declined in both large-scale range and local-scale frequency between the two survey periods.

3000|$|The {{informants}} further narrated {{that the}} level of anthropogenic activities on the Gamoji landscapes such as charcoal burning and logging had increased and affected availability of <b>forage</b> <b>plants.</b> An 80 -year-old informant explained this further [...]...|$|R
50|$|Although fire is {{a natural}} and {{necessary}} occurrence in forest and range ecosystems, it was overused by cattlemen, sheepherders, lumbermen and prospectors in the 1800s. Burning the woods was a practical and efficient way to improve grazing areas. Fires set in autumn left ash and minerals, improving <b>forage</b> (<b>plant</b> growth) in the spring. It also removed obstacles such as fallen logs for the herder and undergrowth that hid the strata for the prospector.|$|E
50|$|Alfalfa {{is widely}} grown {{throughout}} the world as forage for cattle, and is most often harvested as hay, but can also be made into silage, grazed, or fed as greenchop. Alfalfa usually has the highest feeding value of all common hay crops. It is used less frequently as pasture. When grown on soils where it is well-adapted, alfalfa is often the highest-yielding <b>forage</b> <b>plant,</b> but its primary benefit is the combination of high yield per hectare and high nutritional quality.|$|E
50|$|In 1903, Piper began {{a career}} at the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Washington, D.C., which lasted until his death there. He worked on the {{domestication}} and introduction of grasses. On a trip to Africa, he found Sudan grass and introduced it to North America as a <b>forage</b> <b>plant</b> (vegetable matter eaten by livestock). Piper noted that much less study {{had been made of}} forage crops as compared to cotton, cereals, and other crops. He attributed this to the lack of economic incentive in studying forage plants.|$|E
50|$|People {{hunt for}} smaller animals, {{including}} fish. People also begin to <b>forage</b> for <b>plants.</b> The <b>foraging</b> of <b>plants</b> and hunting of small animals {{leads to the}} formation of settlements along the coast of the Pacific Ocean.|$|R
3000|$|The {{informants}} {{observed that}} continuous grazing had affected the vegetation of the Gamoji landscape and important <b>forage</b> <b>plants</b> had hence declined, while invasive plant species are spreading. One informant {{who is a}} herder from his childhood narrates [...]...|$|R
50|$|Sick animals tend to <b>forage</b> <b>plants</b> rich in {{secondary}} metabolites, such as tannins and alkaloids. Since these phytochemicals often have antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal and antihelminthic properties, a plausible {{case can be}} made for self-medication by animals in the wild.|$|R
