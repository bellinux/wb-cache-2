5|$|Deities {{were present}} not only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavens,</b> {{but also in}} the human body itself. They were {{responsible}} for maintaining the body's five viscera, guarding the registers of life, and regulating the souls. There were five internal deities that were particularly important in Lingbao Daoism. The Great Unity lived in the head, along with Lordling and White Prime, who could descend into the liver and lungs. The Director of Destinies lived in the heart and sexual organs, and finally, the Peach Child lived in the lower dantian. Normally these deities resided <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavens,</b> but they could be activated by scriptural recitations to descend into the body.|$|E
5|$|The 19th-century German {{classical}} scholar Erwin Rohde viewed Orion as {{an example}} of the Greeks erasing the line between the gods and mankind. That is, if Orion was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavens,</b> other mortals could hope to be also.|$|E
5|$|In medieval Scandinavia, Snorri Sturluson {{wrote in}} his Prose Edda of ljósálfar and døkkálfar ('light-elves and dark-elves'), the ljósálfar living <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavens</b> and the døkkálfar under the earth. The {{consensus}} of modern scholarship is that Snorri's elves are based on angels and demons of Christian cosmology.|$|E

5|$|The {{scene is}} further embellished around the Guru Rinpoche (Padmashambahava) image {{and also in}} the palace, with gods and goddesses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavens,</b> with gate keepers at the four gates with an army of {{messengers}} and servants; all trying to crush the demons to dust. The supporting staff shown are said to represent the Himalayan tribes of pre-Buddhist periods.|$|E
5|$|In Greek mythology, Corona Borealis {{was linked}} to the legend of Theseus and the minotaur. It was {{generally}} considered to represent a crown given by Dionysus to Ariadne, the daughter of Minos of Crete, after she had been abandoned by the Athenian prince Theseus. When she wore the crown at her marriage to Dionysus, he placed it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavens</b> to commemorate their wedding. An alternate version has the besotted Dionysus give the crown to Ariadne, who in turn gives it to Theseus after he arrives in Crete to kill the minotaur that the Cretans have demanded tribute from Athens to feed. The hero uses the crown's light to escape the labyrinth after disposing of the creature, and Dionysus later sets it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavens.</b> The Latin author Hyginus linked it to a crown or wreath worn by Bacchus (Dionysus) to disguise his appearance when first approaching Mount Olympus and revealing himself to the gods, having been previously hidden as yet another child of Jupiter's trysts with a mortal, in this case Semele. Corona Borealis was one of the 48 constellations mentioned in the Almagest of classical astronomer Ptolemy.|$|E
5|$|The Maya {{viewed the}} cosmos as highly structured; there were {{thirteen}} levels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavens,</b> and nine {{levels in the}} underworld; the mortal world occupied a position between the heavens and the underworld. Each level had four cardinal directions associated with a different colour. Major deities had aspects associated with these directions and colours; north was white, east was red, south was yellow, and west was black.|$|E

5|$|The {{brightest}} star is the 2.8-magnitude Beta Hydri, also the closest reasonably bright star {{to the south}} celestial pole. Pulsating between magnitude 3.26 and 3.33, Gamma Hydri is a variable red giant 60 times the diameter of our Sun. Lying near it is VW Hydri, {{one of the brightest}} dwarf novae <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavens.</b> Four star systems in Hydrus have been found to have exoplanets to date, including HD 10180, which could bear up to nine planetary companions.|$|E
5|$|The {{story is}} preceded by 27 panels showing various preparations, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavens</b> {{and on the}} earth, to welcome the final {{incarnation}} of the Bodhisattva. Before descending from Tushita heaven, the Bodhisattva entrusted his crown to his successor, the future Buddha Maitreya. He descended on earth {{in the shape of}} white elephants with six tusks, penetrated to Queen Maya's right womb. Queen Maya had a dream of this event, which was interpreted that his son would become either a sovereign or a Buddha.|$|E
5|$|Favorinus {{argued that}} it was absurd to imagine that stars and planets would affect human bodies {{in the same way as}} they affect the tides, and equally absurd that small motions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavens</b> cause large changes in people's fates. Sextus Empiricus {{argued that it}} was absurd to link human {{attributes}} with myths about the signs of the zodiac. Carneades argued that belief in fate denies free will and morality; that people born at different times can all die in the same accident or battle; and that contrary to uniform influences from the stars, tribes and cultures are all different.|$|E

5|$|In Greek mythology, Auriga {{is often}} {{identified}} as the mythological Greek hero Erichthonius of Athens, the chthonic son of Hephaestus who was raised by the goddess Athena. Erichthonius was generally credited to be {{the inventor of the}} quadriga, the four-horse chariot, which he used in the battle against the usurper Amphictyon, the event that made Erichthonius the king of Athens. His chariot was created {{in the image of the}} Sun's chariot, the reason Zeus placed him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavens.</b> The Athenian hero then dedicated himself to Athena and, soon after, Zeus raised him into the night sky in honor of his ingenuity and heroic deeds.|$|E
5|$|Itzamna was {{the creator}} god, {{but he also}} {{embodied}} the cosmos, and was simultaneously a sun god; K'inich Ahau, the day sun, {{was one of his}} aspects. Maya kings frequently identified themselves with K'inich Ahau. Itzamna also had a night sun aspect, the Night Jaguar, representing the sun in its journey through the underworld. The four Pawatuns supported the corners of the mortal realm; <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavens,</b> the Bacabs performed the same function. As well as their four main aspects, the Bakabs had dozens of other aspects that are not well understood. The four Chaacs were storm gods, controlling thunder, lightning, and the rains. The nine lords of the night each governed one of the underworld realms. Other important deities included the moon goddess, the maize god, and the Hero Twins.|$|E
5|$|Beads {{made from}} {{meteoric}} iron in 3500BC or earlier {{were found in}} Gerzah, Egypt by G. A. Wainwright. The beads contain 7.5% nickel, which is a signature of meteoric origin since iron found in the Earth's crust generally has only minuscule nickel impurities. Meteoric iron was highly regarded due to its origin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavens</b> and was often used to forge weapons and tools. For example, a dagger made of meteoric iron {{was found in the}} tomb of Tutankhamun, containing similar proportions of iron, cobalt, and nickel to a meteorite discovered in the area, deposited by an ancient meteor shower. Items that were likely made of iron by Egyptians date from 3000 to 2500BC. Meteoritic iron is comparably soft and ductile and easily forged by cold working but may get brittle when heated because of the nickel content.|$|E
50|$|Olorun (Yoruba: Ọlọrun or Ọlọhun) literally, especially, Ọlọrun means The Ruler of (or <b>in)</b> <b>the</b> <b>Heaven</b> i.e. Oni Orún - the Ruler of (or <b>in)</b> <b>the</b> <b>Heaven.</b> <b>In</b> Yoruba Mythology Ọlọrun {{is said to}} be {{the name}} given by the Oracles to one of the three manifestations of <b>the</b> Supreme God <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Yoruba pantheon. Olorun is the owner of <b>the</b> <b>heavens</b> and as {{associated}} with the Sun. The vital energy of Olorun manifests in humans as Ashé, which is the life force that runs through all living things. In Africa, Akamara is believed to be the Source of all Existence. Olodumare carries the responsibility of coordinating the Universe, while Olofi is identified with Olofin Oduduwa (a different entity but born of Akamara) who brings existence to earth on orders from Olodumare.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> <b>The</b> <b>Heaven</b> Sword and Dragon Saber, set <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Yuan dynasty, the Mount Hua Sect is briefly {{mentioned}} {{to be one}} of the six leading orthodox sects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wulin (martial artists' community).

2500|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> Divine Comedy, Dante sees Guiscard's spirit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Heaven</b> of Mars, {{along with}} other [...] "warriors of the faith" [...] who exemplify the {{cardinal}} virtue of fortitude. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Inferno, Dante describes Guiscard's enemies as a field of mutilated shades stretching out to the horizon.|$|R
5|$|Corvus is {{associated}} with the myth of Apollo and his lover Coronis the Lapith. Coronis had been unfaithful to Apollo; when he learned this information from a pure white crow, he turned its feathers black in a fit of rage. Another legend associated with Corvus is that a crow stopped on his way to fetch water for Apollo, to eat figs. Instead of telling the truth to Apollo, he lied and said that a snake, Hydra, kept him from the water, while holding a snake in his talons as proof. Apollo, realizing this was a lie, flung the crow (Corvus), cup (Crater), and snake (Hydra) into the sky. He further punished the wayward bird by ensuring it would forever be thirsty, both in real life and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavens,</b> where the Cup is just out of reach.|$|E
5|$|Less {{than half}} the pages in the atlas are maps. The title page shows King Atlas holding a globe, not {{supporting}} it, then the portrait of Mercator, a dedication to the Dukes of Cleves (father and son), a eulogy on the portrait, two epitaphs, the biography by Ghim, another epitaph by his grandson, two 'testimonial' letters, an ode on King Atlas by a grandson and Mercators own genealogy of Atlas in which he outlines his intended plans {{for the rest of}} the atlas: a description of the creation events, then a description of all that was created <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavens</b> (astronomy and astrology) and finally a description of the Earth, its geography. Of this grandiose plan all that was completed were the first and last objectives. The first part of the atlas, De mundi creatione ac fabrica liber (The creation of the world and the structure of the book), consists of 27 pages of text on the theology of creation, the events of creation, the elements created (such as animals, plants, sun, moon, stars, man), the Fall of Man and finally the salvation of creation through Christ.|$|E
5|$|The first direct {{measurement}} of the distance to a star (61 Cygni at 11.4 light-years) was made in 1838 by Friedrich Bessel using the parallax technique. Parallax measurements demonstrated the vast separation of the stars <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavens.</b> Observation of double stars gained increasing importance during the 19th century. In 1834, Friedrich Bessel observed changes in the proper motion of the star Sirius and inferred a hidden companion. Edward Pickering discovered the first spectroscopic binary in 1899 when he observed the periodic splitting of the spectral lines of the star Mizar in a 104-day period. Detailed observations of many binary star systems were collected by astronomers such as Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve and S. W. Burnham, allowing the masses of stars to be determined from computation of orbital elements. The first {{solution to the problem}} of deriving an orbit of binary stars from telescope observations was made by Felix Savary in 1827.|$|E
