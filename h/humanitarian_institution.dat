40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the {{question}} of food (in) security in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is not necessarily indicative of the country’s actual nutritional conditions but is rather constituted through meaning-making behavior—signifying practices—predominantly on the part of <b>humanitarian</b> aid <b>institutions</b> working there. The argument is not intended to gloss over the food and nutritional situation in North Korea or to suggest that famine, starvation, or malnutrition do not exist. The paper nevertheless argues that <b>humanitarian</b> <b>institutions</b> are not external to or separate from the reality they observe, monitor, and measure, but are rather constitutive of the categories which produce that reality— in this case food (in) security in North Korea. The undertaking of nutrition surveys, food security assessments, and food-aid monitoring as well as the issuing of consensus statements are examples of aid practices that signify North Korea in terms of vulnerability, emergency, and food insecurity. The paper’s central argument is that it is through precisely these observations, assessments, and representations that food (in) security in North Korea comes into being.

5000|$|The International Committee of the Red Cross, {{a private}} <b>humanitarian</b> <b>institution</b> based in Switzerland, {{provided}} {{the first official}} symbol for medical personnel. The first Geneva convention, originally called for [...] "Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field," [...] officially adopted the red cross on a field of white as the identifying emblem. This symbol was meant to signify to enemy combatants that the medic qualifies as a non-combatant, at least while providing medical care. Islamic countries use a Red Crescent instead. During the 1876-1878 war between Russia and Turkey, the Ottoman Empire declared that it would use a red crescent instead of a red cross as its emblem, although it agreed to respect the red cross used by the other side. Although these symbols were officially sponsored by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the Magen David Adom ("MDA"), Israel's emergency relief service, used the Magen David (a red star of David on a white background). Israeli medics still wear the Magen David. To enable MDA to become a fully recognized and participating member of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, Protocol III was adopted. It is {{an amendment to the}} Geneva Conventions relating to the Adoption of an Additional Distinctive Emblem and authorizes the use of a new emblem, known as the third protocol emblem or the Red Crystal. For indicative use on foreign territory, any national society can incorporate its unique symbol into the Red Crystal. Under Protocol III, the MDA will continue to employ the red Magen David for domestic use, and will employ the red crystal on international relief missions.|$|E

40|$|The Chaco War (1932 - 1935) was {{a border}} war fought between Bolivia and Paraguay over the Chaco Boreal, a {{vast expanse of}} land in the centre of South America that was (and still is) {{traditional}} indigenous territory. This thesis analyzes a document published by the League of Nations on the conflict, The Report of the League of Nations Commission on the Chaco Dispute Between Bolivia and Paraguay, from the perspective of critical border studies. The League of Nations considered itself a disinterested third party arbitrator in the dispute. The central argument of this thesis is that the League was not a disinterested party and that its Report on the Chaco War is not a neutral retelling of the events of the Chaco War. Rather, the League’s Report is an expression of dominant Western border-making practices and exemplifies {{the way in which the}} border discourses of the interwar period failed to recognize indigenous sovereignty with respect to land, law and custom. This thesis therefore inquires into the relationship between borders and spatial imaginaries as embedded in three discourses of indigenous dispossession: the doctrine of just war, the legal principle of uti possidetis de jure and the legal concept of terra nullius. The work of Carl Schmitt is used to highlight the links between these border-making discourses and indigenous dispossession. Schmitt’s concept of the nomos is discussed in relation to the spatial order of the League of Nations and its attempts to uphold the Westphalian paradigm of international law while simultaneously claiming to be a <b>humanitarian</b> <b>institution...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} critical perspective on modern practices of humanitarianism by following {{histories of the}} imperial-era Japanese Red Cross Society (JRCS) from its inception in 1877 until the formal dissolution of the Japanese empire in 1945. In the decades after its founding the JRCS became the most prominent <b>humanitarian</b> <b>institution</b> in the Japanese empire and the largest national Red Cross society in the world, drawing its leaders from among {{the most powerful of}} the ruling elites as well as the imperial family. As an state-sanctioned voluntary organization for the relief of human suffering, the JRCS continuously promoted the philosophies and institutions of humanitarianism by applying them across a wide range of political, social, and economic spheres. I argue that the leadership of the JRCS in efforts to rescue the sufferers of war, natural disasters, and disease made it an exemplar of humanitarian imperialism, or the continuous expansion of political domination by state and non-state agencies which operated according to a logic of promoting the life, health and well being of ordinary people. JRCS humanitarian thought and activity formed a key element of the ideology and institutions of imperial rule through five key conceptual categories [...] nation, law, production, hygiene, and gender. Chapter one shows how humanitarianism became an important element of Japanese nationalism by tracing changes in the early historiography of the origins of the JRCS during the Satsuma Civil War of 1877. Chapter two looks at affinities between practices of international humanitarian law and imperialism through the writings of Ariga Nagao [...] JRCS director, battlefield lawyer, and scholar of public administrative law. Chapter three argues that the JRCS relied upon and bolstered capitalistic ideas of wealth production through the representation of capital, land, and labor as sources of profit. Chapter four narrates the entry of the JRCS into the field of hygiene education. Chapter five concludes the work by analyzing the figure of the Red Cross nursing woman in the constitution of imperial gender subjectivitie...|$|E
40|$|In {{this world}} of {{misinformation}} and predatory ideologies, a basic economic connection may {{be the difference between}} the success and failure of American foreign policy in the Middle East. In times of conflict, establishing the commonality of shared financial values can {{be the best way to}} build trust. It is remarkable then that the world’s largest and most advanced economy has failed to develop the simple financial mechanisms—using Islamic finance and Shari’ah boards—to connect with Muslims across the globe. Even if the United States’ central focus remains combating terrorism, it is clear that the more financial information the United States can gather, the better equipped it will be to fight the war on terror. Along with the enhanced information capital made possible through Islamic finance and Shari’ah boards are significant reputational advantages that the United States would not otherwise have. For instance, an Islamic-American <b>humanitarian</b> <b>institution</b> could be certified by multiple clerics in Iraq, thus offering new momentum to the organization’s humanitarian mission by preventing numerous belligerent attacks that terrorists might subject upon a purely American institution that lacks the legitimacy conferred through such Islamic ties. Currently, The United States’ continuing domestic failure to develop a compatible framework for Islamic finance verges on negligence. This failure is strongly contrary to broader American commercial interests. Consider that economists estimate the outflow of Shari’ah capital from Gulf countries to be approximately $ 1 trillion, growing at 20 % per annum. Additionally, Gulf countries are currently set to spend upwards of $ 10 trillion on new infrastructure over the next decade using Shari’ah compliant financing vehicles. The world currently has roughly two billion Muslims, many of which will one day demand, or at least prefer, Shari’ah compliant financial products. If the United States does not develop the administrative and legal framework to serve this market, other foreign financial institutions surely will. In fact, economists currently value the Islamic finance industry in the United Kingdom at $ 12 billion. In stark contrast, in the United States this same market comprises a mere $ 150 million in assets. This article will examine the necessary mechanics of establishing an Islamic-American corporation in Delaware for the purposes of conducting transactions with the Middle East, and analyze in detail the essential Islamic financial governance structure—the Shari’ah board...|$|E
