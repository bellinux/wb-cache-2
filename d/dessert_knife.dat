She was a mentally unstable washerwoman who in 1786 {{had attempted to}} stab King George III with a <b>dessert</b> <b>knife.</b> They also composed a novel together, Lenora, but {{could not find a}} printer who was willing to publish such a subversive work.|$|E

As he received the supposed petition, she made two lunges at his chest with an ivory-handled <b>dessert</b> <b>knife</b> before she was brought under control. George, apparently fearing {{that she would be}} unjustly handled for such a pitiful attack, was reported as saying [...] "The poor creature is mad; do not hurt her, she has not hurt me." ...|$|E
