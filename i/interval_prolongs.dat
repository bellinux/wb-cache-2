40|$|ObjectivesIn {{order to}} more clearly {{understand}} the electrocardiographic manifestations of early transmural ischemia, we studied electrocardiograms (ECGs) in patients undergoing balloon angioplasty. BackgroundDecisions regarding reperfusion strategies {{in patients with}} acute myocardial infarction rely largely {{on the presence of}} ST-segment elevation (STE) in the ECG, consequently with significant limitations. Studies of the “ischemic cascade” show that ST-segment changes occur well after the onset of wall motion abnormalities. MethodsWe prospectively analyzed ECGs obtained at 20 -s intervals in 74 patients undergoing elective balloon angioplasty. The ECGs were analyzed using 3 methodologies. In 74 patients, the ST-segment, the T-wave, and the QT-interval were analyzed using the MUSE (General Electric HC, Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin) automated system (MUSE). Fifty patients were also analyzed using the Interval Editor automated system (IE; General Electric HC). In 20 patients, measurements were made manually. ResultsTransmural ischemia prolonged the QTc interval (using the Bazett’s formula) in 100 % of patients. In all 74 patients analyzed with MUSE, QTc interval prolonged from 423 ± 25 ms to 455 ± 34 ms (p < 0. 001). In the 50 patients analyzed with IE, QTc interval prolonged in 50 of 50 (100 %) patients (from 424 ± 27 ms to 458 ± 33 ms [p < 0. 001]). Mean time to maximal QTc interval prolongation, changes in T-wave polarity, ≥ 1 mm STE, and ST-segment depression (STD) were 22, 24, 29, and 35 s, respectively. Although QTc interval prolonged in 100 % of patients, T-wave changes, STE, and STD (≥ 1 mm) occurred in 7 %, 15 %, and 7 %, respectively.

40|$|More than 70 drugs {{present on}} the Swiss market can cause drug-induced long QT {{syndrome}} (LQTS), which is associated with torsades de pointes (TdP) arrhythmias, potentially leading to sudden cardiac death. Basic and clinical investigations performed {{during the last decade}} have helped {{a better understanding of the}} mechanisms and risk factors of this serious public health problem. In their vast majority, QT <b>interval</b> <b>prolonging</b> drugs block the human ERG (hERG) channel involved in the repolarisation phase of the cardiac action potential, and thus lengthen the QT interval. Beside the well-known QT <b>interval</b> <b>prolonging</b> action of class IA, IC and III anti-arrhythmic drugs, many antibiotics, neurotropic, antifungal, and antimalarial drugs are also able to cause drug-induced LQTS. Reviewing the literature indicates that the risk of QT interval prolongation and TdP is increased in females, in patients with organic heart diseases and hypokalaemia. Furthermore in a few cases, genetic factors have also been reported. However thus far, no genetic test is available to detect at-risk patients, and in consequence, drug prescribers are still relying only on the clinical history and findings to perform an evaluation of the risk. Treatment of drug-induced LQTS and TdP includes identifying and withdrawing the culprit drug(s), infusing magnesium and, in resistant cases acceleration of the heart rate.

40|$|Objective—To assess {{possible}} ECG changes {{caused by}} dobutamine stress and {{their relation to}} wall motion disturbances in patients with coronary artery disease.  Design—Prospective recording and analysis of 12  lead ECG at rest and during each stage of dobutamine stress echocardiography, and correlation with wall motion changes.  Setting—A tertiary referral centre for cardiac disease equipped with non-invasive facilities for pharmacological stress tests.  Subjects— 27 patients, mean (SD) age 60  (8) years, with documented evidence of coronary artery disease in whom dobutamine stress echo was clinically indicated, and 17  controls of similar age.  Results—In controls, all ECG intervals shortened with increasing heart rate but in the patient group only PR and QT intervals shortened while QRS duration broadened and QTc <b>interval</b> <b>prolonged</b> progressively. In the 27  patients, 16  developed chest pain, 15  with reduced left ventricular long axis systolic excursion (p <  0. 001), and all showed reduced peak lengthening rate; ST segment shift appeared in 16,  13  of whom developed chest pain, but did not correlate with reduction of either systolic long axis excursion or peak lengthening rate; QRS duration broadened in 20,  16  with reduction of long axis excursion (p <  0. 02) which was more often seen at the septum (p <  0. 005); QTc <b>interval</b> <b>prolonged</b> in 19, all of whom had associated reduction of peak long axis lengthening rate (p <  0. 02).  Conclusions—QRS duration and QTc interval both normally shorten with dobutamine stress, while in coronary artery disease they both lengthen: changes in QRS duration correlate with systolic and QTc interval with diastolic left ventricular wall motion disturbances.
