6000|$|This is Friedrich's position, Wednesday, June 15th {{and the day}} following; {{somewhat}} nearer his ovens than yesterday. Daun is yet {{parallel to}} him, has his centre behind Swoyschitz, an insignificant Village {{at the foot of}} those Kamhayek Heights, which is, ever since, to be found in Maps. Friday, 17th, Friedrich's bread-wagons and 4,000 having come in, as doubtless the Pandours report in the proper place, Daun does not quite like his strong position any more, but would prefer a stronger. Friday about sunset, [...] "great clouds of dust" [...] rise from Daun: changing his position, the Prussians see, if for Pandours and gathering darkness they can at present see little else. Daun, truly, observing the King to have in that manner edged up, towards Planian, is afraid of his right wing from such a neighbor. So that the reader must take his Map again. Or, if he care not for such things, let him skip, and leave me solitary to my sad function; till we can meet on easier ground, and report the battle which ensued. Daun hustles his right wing back out of that dangerous proximity; wheels his whole right wing and centre ninety degrees round, so as to reach out now towards Kolin, and lie on the north slope of the Kamhayek ridge; places his left wing EN POTENCE (gibbet-wise), hanging round the western end of said Kamhayek, its southern extremity at Swoyschitz, its northern at Hradenin, where (not a mile from Planian) his right wing had formerly been;--with other intricate movements not worth following, under my questionable guidance, on a Map with unpronounceable names. Enough to say that Daun's right wing is now far east at Krzeczhorz, well beyond Chotzemitz, whereabouts his centre now comes to stand (and most of his horse THERE, both the wings being hilly and rough, unfit for horse);--and that, this being nearly the last of Daun's shiftings and hustlings for the present, or indeed <b>in</b> <b>essential</b> <b>respects</b> the very last, readers may as well note the above main points in it.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{political}} scientific {{implications of the}} postulate that political actors behave {{as if they were}} Rational (i. e., Economic) Men. The basic aim of the theoretical discussion is to explain both the existence and substance of norms of social cooperation. Rational Men would cooperate under special circumstances constituting a "coordination problem. " Depending on the details of the situation, they would organize their cooperative efforts through either social processes of mutual adjustment or political-legal processes. The substance of the code of political morality Rational Men would embrace combines an Aggregative Principle that total goods available to society as a whole be maximized and a distributive Works Principle that each individual should prosper according to his own works. The results of this theoretical analysis are subjected to two extended empirical tests. The first is whether the Rational Man code of political morality corresponds <b>in</b> <b>essential</b> <b>respects</b> to the norms of political morality as revealed by linguistic analysis. The second test utilizes both of the theoretical arguments to explain the politics of environmental protection.

40|$|The article revisits the old {{controversy}} {{concerning the}} relation of the mother's brother and sister's son in patrilineal societies in the light both of anthropological criticisms of the very notion of kinship and of evolutionary and epidemiological approaches to culture. It argues that the ritualized patterns of behavior that had been discussed by Radcliffe-Brown, Goody and others are to be explained in terms of the interaction of a variety of factors, some local and historical, others pertaining to general human dispositions. In particular, an evolved disposition to favor relatives can contribute to the development and stabilization of these behaviors, not by directly generating them, but by making them particularly "catchy " and resilient. In this way, it is possible to recognize both that cultural representations and practices are specific to a community at a time in its history (rather than mere tokens of a general type), and that they are, <b>in</b> <b>essential</b> <b>respects,</b> grounded in the common evolved psychology of human beings. One of the most discussed topics in the history of anthropology has been the significance of the relationship between mother's brother and sister's son in patrilineal societies.

40|$|Most social {{institutions}} {{are supposed to}} be relatively benign, so that if they did not exist, rational human beings would find it worthwhile to create them. It is comforting to believe that we have the {{social institutions}} we wish to have, and we wish to have them because they enhance the common good. The article claims that this belief is in some important cases either a self-delusion or a pious lie. The classic example is the state. We are taught that since it is necessary for efficient social coexistence, it should be regarded {{as if it were the}} result of a social contract we have voluntarily entered into. The law-and-economics school generalizes this type of approach in explaining customs and law. Customs and laws evolve in response to needs. They are what they are because they efficiently serve some purpose. Certain primitive customs are rationalized in this way. The article claims that some of these rationalizations are grossly implausible. One primitive custom, reciprocal gift-giving and hospitality, is alleged to be a mutual insurance scheme, an allegation there are strong reasons to doubt. This custom, then, is said to be the ancestor of the modern welfare state. Both the ancient custom and its modern equivalent are efficient because mutual insurance that redistributes risk is itself efficient. The article demonstrates that mutual insurance and the welfare state are different <b>in</b> <b>essential</b> <b>respects,</b> and the legitimising analogy is false...|$|E
40|$|Information on {{lightning}} {{may improve}} rain estimates made from infrared {{images of a}} geostationary satellite. We address this proposition through a case from the Cooperative Huntsville Meteorological Experiment (COHMEX). During the afternoon and evening of 13 July 1986 waves of showers and thunderstorms developed over and near the lower Tennessee River Valley. For the shower and thunderstorm region within 200 km of the National Weather Service radar at Nashville, Tennessee, we measure cold-cloud area in a sequence of GOES infrared images covering all but {{the end of the}} shower and thunderstorm period. From observations of the NASA/Marshall direction-finding network in this small domain, we also count cloud-to-ground lightning flashes and, from scans of the Nashville radar, we calculate volume rain flux. Using {{a modified version of the}} Williams and Houze scheme, over an area within roughly 240 km of the radar (the large domain), we identify and track cold cloud systems. For these systems, over the large domain, we measure area and count flashes; over the small domain, we calculate volume rain flux. For a temperature threshold of 235 K, peak cloud area over the small domain lags both peak rain flux and peak flash count by about four hours. At a threshold of 226 K, the lag is about two hours. Flashes and flux are matched in phase. Over the large domain, nine storm systems occur. These range in size from 300 to 60, 000 km(exp 2); in lifetime, from about 2 1 / 2 h to 6 h or more. Storm system area lags volume rain flux and flash count; nevertheless, it is linked with these variables. <b>In</b> <b>essential</b> <b>respects</b> the associations were the same when clouds were defined by a threshold of 226 K. Tentatively, we conclude that flash counts complement infrared images in providing significant additional information on rain flux...|$|E
40|$|Developing {{tasks and}} {{organizations}} involves risk, and investments in planning, equipment, and training evoke expectations {{that may not}} be fulfilled. Therefore, it would be desirable to use an experimenting approach, and successively try and test new courses of action under realistic conditions. Simulation of task behavior should be one component in such an approach. In this study simulation is based on a model description of real events and preferred new states. Simulation involves design of situations and tasks that mirrors the model <b>in</b> <b>essential</b> <b>respects.</b> Thus, the advocated approach to simulation admits independent manipulation of situations, testing of behavioral consequences, and training for skill mastery. Simulation has commonly been used as an isolated method for training of individual skills or group behavior. In this study the aim was to develop and apply the simulation method for improving complex communication tasks and organizational systems. Two projects were conducted with a starting point in field studies of actual core operations and modeling of new systems objectives. In both cases the model-based simulations involved testing and training of communicative behavior to develop tasks and to fulfill organizational objectives. The first project concerned how labor inspectors handled new demands on a complex inspection task of the employers’ internal control of the working environment. Field studies indicated that negative transfer of old inspection strategies hampered the adjust-ment to the new task demands. However, the inherent weaknesses of field observations made it difficult to separate the effects of natural context from the consequences of inspection strategies. Consequently, simulated inspections were designed for control of possible sources of bias and contextual conditions. The simulations involved roleplays between inspectors and actors in prepared roles in a conference setting. The results confirmed that individual differences could be related to deficient inspection strategies. In a new simulation study think-aloud techniques were used, which improved training and made it possible to examine an inspector’s reasoning. The interpretation was that the inspectors developed a conscious action schema to handle inspections of control systems. Thus, the simulations succeeded in unraveling some important conditions of monitoring inspection behavior. This would make the training results more practically sustainable. In the second project simulation was used in a program for organizational development. The program aimed at implementing a system for quality control in an elderly care organization. Modeling of formal requirements and results from field observations of deficient quality control monitored the simulation design. Two coordinated quality systems were included in the simulation model, one at the individual resident level and one for self- assessment at department level. Essential communication situations were identified, and a simulation design of integrated studio sessions and controlled applications was set up. Initially the focus was on testing and developing leader skills. In the following simulations the focus was on establishing permanent organizational effects through training of individual and group tasks. An evaluation design monitored the development process. Data collection involved observations, judgments, interviews and protocol analysis. The design put emphasis on process evaluation but ended with an independent outcome evaluation. The results showed that simulation activities enhanced transfer of training effects to actual improvements of core operations. In total 43 departments participated in the program. Practical conditions of personnel mobility and shifting work-schedules required a flexible design of sampling participants in order to maintain continuity in the quality development. A crucial methodological conclusion from this study is that a systematic but flexible design of simulations is necessary for the results to be sustainable. Godkänd; 2004; 20061026 (haneit...|$|E
