40|$|Abstract. A <b>group</b> <b>is</b> called linear {{if it has}} a {{faithful}} linear (com-plex) representation.

5|$|After {{playing for}} more than 16 hours per week, the <b>group</b> <b>were</b> {{contacted}} by Allan Williams, who wanted {{them to go to}} Hamburg. Derry and the Seniors were successful there, and Williams wanted an additional group. As Storm and the <b>group</b> <b>were</b> committed to Butlins, they turned Williams' offer down (as did Gerry and the Pacemakers) so Williams sent the Beatles to Hamburg instead. After the summer season ended in early October 1960, Storm and the Hurricanes were free to travel to Hamburg, replacing Derry and the Seniors at the Kaiserkeller. They arrived in Hamburg on 1 October 1960, having negotiated to be paid more than the Seniors or the Beatles. They played five or six 90-minute sets every day alternating with The Beatles. Storm and The Hurricanes were later presented with a special certificate by Bruno Koschmider (the owner of the Kaiserkeller) for their performances.|$|E
