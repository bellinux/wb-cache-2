5|$|In {{the state}} {{legislative}} elections of 1830, the ascendent Whig Party {{gained control of}} both houses of the General Assembly. Rowan's strict adherence to Jeffersonian democracy and leadership of the New Court faction during the court controversy of the 1820s had put him at odds with Whig founder Henry Clay. By this time, however, not even Rowan's <b>fellow</b> <b>Democrats</b> endorsed his re-election. Henry Clay was elected instead.|$|E
5|$|As the 46th Congress {{convened in}} 1879, the Democratic caucus was reduced, {{but they still}} held a {{plurality}} of seats. The new House contained 152 Democrats, 139 Republicans, and 20 independents, {{most of whom were}} affiliated with the Greenback Party. Many of Randall's <b>fellow</b> <b>Democrats</b> differed with him over protectionism and his lack of support for Southern railroad subsidies, and considered choosing Joseph Clay Stiles Blackburn of Kentucky as their nominee for Speaker, instead. Several other Southerners' names were floated, too, as anti-Randall Democrats tried to coalesce around a single candidate; in the end, none could be found and the caucus chose Randall as their nominee with 107 votes out of 152. With some Democrats not yet present, however, the Democrats began to fear that the Republicans and Greenbackers would strike a deal to combine their votes to elect James A. Garfield of Ohio as Speaker. When the time for the vote came, however, Garfield refused to make any compromises with the third-party men, and Randall and the Democrats were able to organize the House once more.|$|E
5|$|Due to ill health, Blackburn {{could not}} take {{an active part in}} the {{campaign}}. He sought relief from his ailments at Crab Orchard Springs, while much of the campaign oratory was delivered on his behalf by <b>fellow</b> <b>Democrats</b> Boyd Winchester, Parker Watkins Hardin, W. C. P. Breckinridge, and others. Republicans, who had nominated Walter Evans, had fewer speakers with which to canvass the state, and were at a decided disadvantage. Democrats attacked the administrations of Republican Presidents Ulysses S. Grant and Rutherford B. Hayes, cited the alleged abuses perpetrated in the South by Carpetbaggers and Scalawags, and leveled charges that Republicans favored capitalists over the state's working class. Republican orators, led by William O'Connell Bradley, charged Democrats with financial extravagance, citing a $3million surplus in the state treasury in 1865 compared with a $1million debt in 1878. Bradley claimed that Democrats had maintained their power in the state through gerrymandering election districts. He cited poor conditions at the state penitentiary and inadequate funding of public education as evidence of Democratic mismanagement of the state.|$|E

50|$|On May 27, 2017, in a turnout of 20.2 {{percent of}} {{registered}} voters in a special election, Price handily defeated his <b>fellow</b> <b>Democrat,</b> Warren Harang, III, 9,224 (63 percent) to 5,507 (37 percent) {{for the right to}} finish the remainder of <b>fellow</b> <b>Democrat</b> Troy E. Brown's term in the state Senate. Carter resigned in an ethical cloud earlier in the year.|$|R
5|$|Jackson quickly built a {{track record}} of never missing a floor vote. Once he nearly missed his great-grandmother's funeral for a roll call, but the {{presiding}} officer was able to slightly delay the closing the roll, thereby keeping his attendance record. <b>Fellow</b> <b>Democrats</b> said he debates and votes with a contentiousness that makes it difficult to view him as a team player. Jackson developed foes not only in the House, but also in Chicago against William Daley, who had a hand in several attempts to block Jackson's seating on the transportation committee he desired because of his support for a third Chicago airport. Jackson has also been a target of conservative media figures. Jackson established a heavily liberal voting record on both social and fiscal issues. During the 1990s, because of his name recognition and liberal track record, Jackson received many public speaking and media requests.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after taking}} office, Cleveland {{was faced with}} the task of filling all the {{government}} jobs for which the president had the power of appointment. These jobs were typically filled under the spoils system, but Cleveland announced that he would not fire any Republican who was doing his job well, and would not appoint anyone {{solely on the basis of}} party service. He also used his appointment powers to reduce the number of federal employees, as many departments had become bloated with political time-servers. Later in his term, as his <b>fellow</b> <b>Democrats</b> chafed at being excluded from the spoils, Cleveland began to replace more of the partisan Republican officeholders with Democrats.; this was especially the case with policy making positions. While some of his decisions were influenced by party concerns, more of Cleveland's appointments were decided by merit alone than was the case in his predecessors' administrations.|$|E
5|$|Mills's and Cleveland's defeat on the tariff {{bill could}} be {{considered}} a victory for Randall, but the vote showed how isolated the former Speaker's protectionist ideas now made him in his party: only four Democrats voted against the tariff reductions. The state party likewise turned against Randall and toward free trade, adopting a pro-tariff revision platform at the 1888 state Democratic convention. At the same time, Randall seemingly reversed his long-standing commitment to fiscal economy by voting with the Republicans to override Cleveland's veto of the Dependent and Disability Pension Act. The Act would have given a pension to every Union veteran (or their widows) who claimed he could no longer perform physical labor, regardless of whether his disability was war-related. Cleveland's veto was in line with his record of small-government cost-cutting, with which Randall would normally have sympathized. Randall, perhaps in an effort to gain favor with veterans in his district, joined the Republicans in an unsuccessful attempt to override Cleveland's veto. Another possibility proposed by biographer House is that Randall saw the federal budget surplus as reason to cut tariffs; by increasing federal spending, he hoped to decrease the surplus and maintain the need for high tariffs. Whatever the reason, the attempt failed and left Randall further alienated from his <b>fellow</b> <b>Democrats.</b>|$|E

He was unopposed in 1996. Caldwell secured a fifth term in 2002, when he defeated <b>fellow</b> <b>Democrat</b> Raymond [...] "Ray" [...] Cannon, 4,987 (56 percent) to 3,931 (44 percent) in another low-turnout election.|$|R

25|$|Several state senators, {{including}} <b>fellow</b> <b>Democrats</b> Neil Breslin, Darrel Aubertine, and David Valesky, {{called for}} Espada {{to step down}} from his leadership positions in the New York State Senate. State Senator Martin Golden of Brooklyn also introduced an amendment to force Espada from his majority leader position.|$|E
25|$|Throughout Zell Miller's {{career as}} a U.S. Senator he showed {{increasing}} support for Republicans and increasing criticism of Democrats, leading some to question whether his <b>fellow</b> <b>Democrats</b> in the Senate {{had given him a}} lukewarm reception. However, given his beginnings as a conservative southern Democrat, it is likely he found his views drastically different from the more liberal ideology of the national party.|$|E
25|$|The State Senate {{had been}} {{controlled}} by Republicans since 1964, but Democrats {{were able to}} win {{a majority in the}} 2008 elections. The change was helped by upstate Republican billionaire Tom Golisano, who had donated $5 million to the Democrats' campaigns. However, dissatisfaction with the job that Majority Leader Malcolm Smith was doing was growing with his <b>fellow</b> <b>Democrats,</b> as well as with Golisano.|$|E

25|$|Robb later {{served as}} Democratic {{member of the}} US Senate from 1989 until 2001. Robb was elected in 1988, {{defeating}} Maurice Dawkins with 71% of the vote. Robb ranked annually {{as one of the}} most ideologically centrist senators and often acted as a bridge between Democratic and Republican members, as he preferred background deal-making to legislative limelight. His <b>fellow</b> <b>Democrats</b> removed him from the Budget Committee for advocating deeper cuts in federal spending.|$|E
25|$|Golisano, {{with the}} aid of his {{political}} adviser Steve Pigeon, set up a series of private meetings between Republican senators Dean Skelos, Tom Libous, and George D. Maziarz, and after Pigeon convinced him, Democratic senator Pedro Espada Jr. The first meeting took place at a club in Albany, followed by one at Golisano's house in Rochester, followed by a series at Espada's house in Albany. Espada said that Senator Monserrate was the only one among his <b>fellow</b> <b>Democrats</b> that knew of the meetings.|$|E
25|$|The {{presidency}} of Franklin Pierce began on March 4, 1853, when Franklin Pierce was inaugurated as President of the United States, and ended on March 4, 1857. Pierce, a Democrat from New Hampshire, took office as the 14th United States president after routing Whig Party nominee Winfield Scott in the 1852 presidential election. Seen by <b>fellow</b> <b>Democrats</b> as pleasant and accommodating {{to all the}} party's factions, Pierce, then a little-known politician, won the presidential nomination on the 49th ballot of the 1852 Democratic National Convention.|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of the Assembly session in 1972, Democratic {{leadership}} had wanted to name S. Howard Woodson of Trenton as Speaker, until Assemblyman David Friedland made a deal as one of four Democrats who voted to give the minority Republicans control of the General Assembly, electing Kean as Assembly Speaker. Woodson would have been the Assembly's first African American Speaker, and charges of racism were leveled by <b>fellow</b> <b>Democrats</b> against Friedland. In the next Assembly, in 1974, the Democrats united behind Woodson for Speaker; Kean then became the minority leader of the Assembly. In 1973, he briefly served as acting New Jersey governor.|$|E
25|$|In the 1952 general election, Republicans won a {{majority}} in both the House and Senate. Among defeated Democrats that year was McFarland, who lost to upstart Barry Goldwater. In January 1953, Johnson was chosen by his <b>fellow</b> <b>Democrats</b> to be the minority leader; he became the most junior Senator ever elected to this position. One of his first actions was to eliminate the seniority system in making appointments to committees, while retaining it for chairmanships. In the 1954 election, Johnson was re-elected to the Senate, and since the Democrats won {{the majority in the}} Senate, Johnson then became majority leader. Former majority leader William Knowland became minority leader. Johnson's duties were to schedule legislation and help pass measures favored by the Democrats. Johnson, Rayburn and President Dwight D. Eisenhower worked well together in passing Eisenhower's domestic and foreign agenda.|$|E
25|$|In early 2012, Delegate Norton {{agreed to}} {{organize}} her <b>fellow</b> <b>Democrats</b> in the House {{in opposition to}} redesignation of the D.C. War Memorial. In the spring, Norton's staff worked out an agreement with Poe and Cleaver in which they agreed to prohibit infringement on the D.C. memorial. In exchange, Norton agreed to support construction of a national World War I memorial on the National Mall. Yet, {{by the summer of}} 2012, D.C. officials, Norton, and their congressional supporters were pushing for a national World War I memorial at Pershing Park. The D.C. Council passed a nonbinding resolution to that effect in June. Norton's shift in attitude came after National Park Service officials convinced her that allowing construction on the Mall would severely weaken the Commemorative Works Act, an amendment to which in 2003 had all but banned new memorials on the Mall. Meanwhile, discussion among members of Congress had turned toward giving the World War I Centennial Commission authority to build the new memorial. The centennial commission, too, concluded that there was no room on the Mall to build a memorial.|$|E
