It is argued that Scaling techniques provide a framework for the interpretation of DEA efficiency scores. A methodology is porposed and illustrated {{by means of}} a case study: the <b>dot</b> <b>com</b> <b>business.</b> This methodology has the advantage of visualising the main characteristics of the situation under investigation, and revealing aspects that would otherwise have remained hidden. It is shown that DEA model selection can greatly benefit from its inclusion in a scaling framework. It is also shown how the mehtodology proposed can highlight various strategic behaviours that firms follow in the path to efficency...|$|E

It then goes on to consider the factors which led to the emergence of the <b>dot</b> <b>coms</b> such as the emergence of the commercial Internet, the lowering of entry barriers which followed from this and the funding available for new businesses through venture capital. The article also {{looks at the}} reasons why it was believed that the <b>dot</b> <b>coms</b> represented a threat to established businesses.

40|$|Principal Topic: Choice of an {{appropriate}} business model {{is essential to}} the nascent entrepreneurial firm. The term 'business model' describes the collective of the strategies and tactics the firm uses to make money and outlines the underlying economic logic that explains how the firm creates value and delivers that value to the customer at a reasonable cost. Despite the widespread use of the term "business model" there is still much confusion over what the term actually represents. The theoretical foundations of the business model are not fully developed (Amit & Zott, 2001) and its application remains unclear (Morris et al., 2006). However, since the emergence of the <b>dot.</b> <b>com</b> <b>businesses,</b> the discussion of business models has gained more attention from business scholars as well as practitioners. Due to the importance of having a clearly articulated business model as early as possible in the new venture creation process (Barringer & Ireland, 2006), the business model concept is now being emphasized in the entrepreneurship literature. Much of the research on business models has focused on defining the term and proposing various typologies. While several of these share similar components, none have become generally accepted. Consequently, there is a significant need to empirically test the various dimensions proposed in the literature in order to clarify the components of the business model and uncover the key dimensions. Methodology/Key Propositions: This study is the first empirical study that we are aware of to investigate the underlying dimensions and components of the firm's business model. In order to identify the various components we first conducted a thorough review of the literature on business models, which uncovered more than a dozen papers dealing with business model definitions and the components of the business model construct. After considering this literature we compiled a comprehensive list of around 50 different components or elements specified as being unique to the firm's business model. From this list a survey questionnaire has been developed with a Likert scale response to the relevant importance of the components to the firm's business model. The survey instrument for the research is completed and the pilot testing using a web based survey instrument and a sample of intending entrepreneurs is currently underway. Once this is completed we will be conducting a similar web base survey on small business owners from a previously identified database. We plan to use exploratory factor analysis to analyse the data to identify the key components comprising the business model. Results and Implications: Prior business model research has been theoretically based, or with only casual empiricism (e. g. Morris et al. 2005), and has resulted {{in a number of different}} definitions and typologies of the business model. This research aims to be the first empirical study to investigate the underlying structure of the key elements of the firm's business model. In doing so we believe this research will make a valuable contribution to the research on business models and a guide for entrepreneurs wishing a craft more effective strategies to create and capture value...|$|R

40|$|The web {{as we know}} it {{has evolved}} rapidly over the last decade. We have gone from a phase of rapid growth as seen with the <b>dot.</b> <b>com</b> boom where <b>business</b> was king to the current web 2. 0 phase where social networking, Wiki’s, Blogs and other related tools flood the {{bandwidth}} of the world wide web. The empowerment of the web user with web 2. 0 technologies has led to the exponential growth of data, information and knowledge on the web. With this rapid change, {{there is a need to}} logically categorise this information and knowledge so it can be fully utilised by all. It can be argued that the power of the knowledge held on the web is not fully exposed under its current structure and to improve this we need to explore the foundations of the web. This dissertation will explore the evolution of the web from its early days to the present day. It will examine the way web content is stored and discuss the new semantic technologies now available to represent this content. The research aims to demonstrate the possibilities of efficient knowledge extraction from a knowledge portal such as a Wiki or SharePoint portal using these semantic technologies. This generation of dynamic knowledge content within a limited domain will attempt to demonstrate the benefits of semantic web to the knowledge age...|$|R
