These tracks include [...] "Intuition", in which Lennon relates how life experience has honed his instincts and how it's good to have <b>gotten</b> <b>through</b> it. While demoing the song on piano in early 1973, with the lyrics still incomplete, he added a few lines from two previously released tracks – [...] "How?", from Imagine (1971), and [...] "God", from John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970).

2500|$|The {{original}} financing plan, {{of using}} the revenues from radio receiver sales to pay station costs, proved to be insufficient {{for a number of}} reasons. Additional expenses included the requirement to pay royalties to musical composers, plus the fact that, unlike the amateur Westinghouse Company staff performers, professional acts started to expect to be paid in something more tangible than publicity. On the revenue side, Westinghouse found that it didn't have the near-monopoly for selling vacuum-tube receivers that it expected it had <b>gotten</b> <b>through</b> the purchase of the commercial rights to the Armstrong regenerative patent. Armstrong had previously sold [...] "amateur and experimental" [...] rights to around 17 small firms, which also began selling receivers to the general public. Westinghouse sued on the grounds that this went beyond their rights, but lost, which resulted in the formation of a series of major competitors, including Crosley and Zenith.|$|E
