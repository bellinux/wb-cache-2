5|$|East Timor and Indonesia {{have sought}} to build {{friendly}} relations since 2002. While movements of people and drug smuggling across their international border has caused tensions, both countries <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> the UN to improve the security situation in the region. The East Timorese and Indonesian governments signed a defence agreement in August 2011 which aims to improve co-operation between their national militaries. The Timor Leste-Indonesia Defense Joint Committee was also established {{at this time to}} monitor the agreement's implementation.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} filmmakers have {{proposed}} films based on Cassidy's life, and <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> {{her family to}} greater or lesser degrees, but to date these projects have not progressed past the early development stages. In late 2007, AIR Productions acquired the rights to produce a film based on Cassidy's life. It is being produced by Amy Redford (daughter of actor/director Robert Redford), Irwin Shapiro and Rick Singer. In an interview a year earlier, Cassidy's parents suggested Kirsten Dunst or Emily Watson as possible actresses who could play their daughter.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{questions}} {{over the new}} ships' nomenclature came uncertainty about their actual role due to their lack of protection. If they were primarily to act as scouts for the battle fleet and hunter-killers of enemy cruisers and commerce raiders, then the seven inches of belt armour with {{which they had been}} equipped would be adequate. If, on the other hand, they were expected to reinforce a battle line of dreadnoughts with their own heavy guns, they were too thin-skinned to be safe from an enemy's heavy guns. The Invincibles were essentially extremely large, heavily armed, fast armoured cruisers. However, the viability of the armoured cruiser was already in doubt. A cruiser that could <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> the Fleet might have been a more viable option for taking over that role.|$|E

30|$|Most specialists (60  %) {{reported}} {{working with}} FCC providers from 1 to 5  years {{and a third}} (33  %) reported working with providers for 6  years or more. Prior work experience was assessed based on specialists’ reports of their two most recent jobs previous to their current <b>work</b> <b>with</b> providers {{and whether or not}} they <b>had</b> ever <b>worked</b> as a FCC provider. Specialists who themselves <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> as FCC providers or center-based teachers were considered as <b>having</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> children. Specialists who <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> as a center director, in an administrative, consulting, or home visiting role were considered as <b>having</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> adults.

5|$|In 2011, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{approved}} a plan first introduced in 1992 by California's state government. The {{plan called for}} major cleanup of the lower river {{in order to protect}} salmon from phosphorus, nitrogen, and carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand. It also expressed concern over high water temperatures, algal blooms, and low oxygen levels, although certain fish have adapted to some of these issues. Environmental groups, more than six government agencies, Native American tribes in the basin, and others <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> the EPA to reduce pollution levels in the Klamath.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written and {{directed}} by series co-creator Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States. The episode was conceived from a joke among Parker and fellow co-creator Matt Stone about a fish dressed as motorcycle daredevil Evel Knievel, which eventually turned into a joke about Kanye West not understanding a joke about why liking fishsticks made him a gay fish. The way Cartman tries to steal credit for the joke was inspired by real people Parker and Stone <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> in the television business.|$|E
5|$|A 1980 US {{indictment}} {{said that}} Francisco Rafael was {{under investigation by}} the DEA for alleged cocaine and heroin distribution in the San Diego area. The DEA had identified him as one of the cocaine suppliers and set up an undercover operation to arrest him and his associates by purchasing multi-ton shipments of cocaine. He admitted to <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> drug distributor Ramón Torresillos-Rendón, and that he used him as a mediator for a drug transaction with an undercover federal agent. In court, Francisco Rafael admitted having sent Torresillos-Rendón and four other individuals to sell nine ounces of cocaine to the agent. He was arrested in California on 7 August 1980 and remained under custody until or around 8 September 1980 after paying a US$150,000 bond and promising to appear at every court session.

5|$|In Tallahassee, Florida, on December 21, 1999, a {{memorial}} service is held for a former FBI agent named Raymond Crouch. His widow is approached by a mysterious man, Mark Johnson (Holmes Osborne), who claims to <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> her husband. After the other mourners have left, Johnson returns to the funeral parlor, dons the corpse's clothes, and places a cell phone in the coffin. One week later, Johnson is monitoring Crouch's grave when his phone rings; he walks towards the grave with a shovel. Subsequently, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are called in to examine Crouch's empty grave. They notice damage done to {{the interior of the}} casket; Scully theorizes that the scene was staged. A briefing is held by Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), who notes that Crouch is one of four former FBI agents whose graves have been exhumed; all four men had committed suicide. Because of the presence of goat's blood encircling the grave, Mulder states that the crime was an act of necromancy. After the briefing, Skinner takes the agents aside and asks them to investigate Crouch's possible ties to the Millennium Group, which is now dissolved.|$|E
5|$|Loggerhead {{sea turtles}} are {{classified}} as endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and are listed under Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, making international trade illegal. In the United States, the Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service classify them as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. Loggerheads are listed as endangered under both Australia's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and Queensland's Nature Conservation Act 1992.

5|$|The group's {{earliest}} incarnation included German drummer En Esch and British vocalist Raymond Watts, {{the latter}} of whom left and rejoined the group several times over its history. The trio recorded the band's earliest albums in Germany before Konietzko and Esch moved to the United States, where they found much greater success with seminal industrial record label Wax Trax!. German guitarist Günter Schulz joined in 1990; both he and Esch continued with the band until KMFDM broke up in 1999.

Later Gorner meets him on a boat and tries to shoot him, but Bond pushes him overboard, where he is torn to pieces by a propeller. With the subsequent elimination of both Chagrin and Gorner, Bond considers his mission a success, and on condition that the agent M has waiting in the wings will not take his place Bond is sent to assess the new agent, designated 004.
