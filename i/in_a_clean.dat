At Survivor Series, DX got their revenge when their team {{defeated}} Edge and Orton's team <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>clean</b> sweep during their five-on-five elimination match. In January 2007, at New Year's Revolution, DX and Rated-RKO fought to a no contest after Triple H suffered a legitimate torn right quadriceps (similar to the one he suffered in 2001 in his other leg) 15 minutes into the match. Surgery was successfully performed on January 9, 2007 by Dr. James Andrews.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{presence}} of any extended foreground correlated regions <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cleaned</b> CMB map. To estimate the cosmological parameters of interest, it is cus-tomary to employ a galactic mask on <b>a</b> <b>cleaned</b> map to omit the galactic region which remain contaminated even after cleaning. This study shows that there are residual foreground correlations present even outside a galactic mask, which could potentially be responsible {{for some of the}} large scale anomalies found in CMB. Here, we defined two correlation statistics, one in pixel space and the other in multipole space. Pixel correlation statistic was used to convey a pictorial impression of the level of resid-ual foregrounds present <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cleaned</b> map, while the multipole correlation statistic was used to identify any polluted multipoles. Using the pixel statistic, we find that there are notable spatially-extended, foreground-correlated features in the estimated CMB map. One interesting feature we found is that, the anomalous CMB cold spot region in the southern galactic hemisphere is highly correlated with synchrotron emis-sion templates. Using the multipole statistic, we find that the CMB quadrupole is contaminated by synchrotron. Key words:...|$|R

She enters the motel room wearing a trench coat, and removes it to reveal the lingerie underneath. She begins to passionately kiss Sam, and they lie on the bed.

The brothers use the root to make tea, and soon find themselves <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>clean</b> version of Bobby's house. Sam goes outside into brightly lit scenery of flowers and singing birds, but becomes locked out of the house. Inside, Dean locates Bobby, who {{does not believe that}} he is dreaming. A woman with stab wounds approaches them, and Bobby reveals that she is his wife. Years prior, she became possessed, and Bobby was forced to stab her because {{he did not know how}} to exorcise the demon from her; her death led him to become a hunter.

5|$|In September, Murray {{played his}} debut singles {{match for the}} Davis Cup in the World Group Play-off against Switzerland in Geneva on clay with Greg Rusedski, Alan Mackin and David Sherwood. Captain Jeremy Bates {{surprised}} everyone by naming Murray as the British No 1 and Alan Mackin as British No 2. Under the Davis Cup rules, this meant that for Friday's singles, Murray played the Swiss No 2, Stan Wawrinka while Mackin played the Swiss No 1, Roger Federer. Both of them lost their rubbers, giving Switzerland a 2–0 lead. Under the rules, for Sunday's reverse singles, Bates {{would have been able}} to substitute Mackin with Greg Rusedski, so that Rusedski would play Wawrinka, while Murray played Federer. However, Bates believed that Federer was virtually unbeatable because he was on a winning streak and hadn’t lost since June, and consequently Britain gambled on beating Wawrinka twice, with Murray playing Wawrinka when he was freshest. In the doubles, Murray/Rusedski played Federer and Yves Allegro, leaving Rusedski to play only once. The British tactics came to nought as Switzerland won the doubles rubber as well, gaining an unassailable 3–0 lead after two days. Alan Mackin and David Sherwood were consequently nominated for the dead singles rubbers losing both of them, resulting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>clean</b> sweep for Switzerland.|$|E

25|$|Bernard Kettlewell was {{the first}} to {{investigate}} the evolutionary mechanism behind peppered moth adaptation, between 1953 and 1956. He found that a light-coloured body was an effective camouflage <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>clean</b> environment, such as in Dorset, while the dark colour was beneficial in a polluted environment like in Birmingham. This selective survival was due to birds which easily caught dark moths on clean trees, and white moths on trees darkened with soot. The story, supported by Kettlewell's experiment, became the canonical example of Darwinian evolution and evidence for natural selection used in standard textbooks.|$|E
25|$|Fully {{independent}} {{double wishbone}} suspension was employed at all four corners. Another significant change {{made from the}} P61 design was to move the suspension shock absorber components outboard at the rear. This switch was initially made to accommodate the extra cam-cover space needed to employ the 32-valve motor, but though that unit was shelved the suspension geometry was retained. At the front, the coil spring and damper units were retained within the monocoque skin, resulting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>clean,</b> aerodynamic profile around the car's nose-cone.

At the event on June 19, Ambrose won the Money in the Bank ladder match and Rollins would go on to regain the title in the main event only to lose the title to Ambrose after he successfully cashed in his Money in the Bank briefcase, thus all of the former Shield members were world champion on the same night. As a result of the 2016 WWE draft on July 19, Ambrose was drafted to SmackDown while Rollins and Reigns were drafted to Raw, thus ending any possibility of a reunion.
