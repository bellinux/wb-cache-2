40|$|Abstract—The {{possibility}} of using an active <b>internal</b> <b>matching</b> element in {{several types of}} metamaterial-inspired, electrically small antennas (ESAs) to overcome their inherent narrow bandwidths is demonstrated. Beginning with the Z antenna, which is frequency tunable through its internal lumped element inductor, a circuit model is developed to determine an <b>internal</b> <b>matching</b> network, i. e., a frequency dependent inductor, {{which leads to the}} desired enhanced bandwidth performance. An analytical relation between the resonant frequency and the inductor value is determined via curve fitting of the associated HFSS simulation results. With this inductance-frequency relation defining the inductor values, a broad bandwidth, electrically small Z antenna is established. This <b>internal</b> <b>matching</b> network paradigm is then confirmed by applying it to the electrically small stub and canopy antennas. An electrically small canopy antenna with = 0 0467 that has over a 10 % bandwidth is finally demonstrated. The potential implementation of the required frequency dependent inductor is also explored with a well-defined active negative impedance converter circuit that reproduces the requisite inductance-frequency relations.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the metaphoric {{use of language}} symbols in analogy to the nonlinguistic pragmatics of using a tool. The basic mechanism of natural language communication is analyzed as an <b>internal</b> <b>matching</b> between the signs ’ literal meaning and the contextual referents, {{based on the principle}} of best match. An important precondition for successful reference is thereby the delimitation of potential referential candidates in the speaker-hearer-internal context of use. This delimitation is based on the STAR-point, i. e. the parameters of the sign’s origin. The pragmatic hierarchy of language uses presented in conclusion is compared with a task of nonlinguistic pragmatics, whereby the different types of use are explained as a way to overcome the inherently limited choice of words for an unlimited variety of referents. 1 Using an organon A theory of nonlinguistic pragmatics must describe the structure of the tools, of the objects to be worked on, and the user’s strategies of applying a tool to an object in order to realize a certain purpose. Analogously, a theory of linguistic pragmatics requires an explicit definition of literal meaning (tool), of the interpretation context (object to be worked on), and of the strategies for relating a literal meaning and a context such that the intended speaker meaning is communicated. Just as a tool is positioned in a specific spot of the object to be worked on and then manipulated in a purposeful way, a suitable literal meaning is positioned relative to a certain internal subcontext in order to represent it linguistically (speaker mode) or to insert it into the subcontext (hearer mode). 2 <b>Internal</b> <b>matching</b> pragmatics In the SLIM theory of language, 1 the utterance meaning (meaning 2) is defined as the use of a literal meaning (meaning 1) relative to a context of use. Reference is modeled as an <b>internal</b> <b>matching</b> procedure between the meaning 1 of language (types) and corresponding contextual referents (I-concepts loc, tokens).
