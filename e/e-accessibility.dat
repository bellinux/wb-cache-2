She is mostly known as representative of the guide dog movement, through [...] "Lara Guide-Dog School Hellas" [...] a non - profit organisation that she co-founded in 2008. She is an activist, promoting human diversity, guide dog access, physical and electronic accessibility and animal rights. She is also a scientist with superior studies in experimental psychology and cognitive science. From 2006 to 2012, {{she worked as a}} researcher in the Human/computer Interaction Laboratory, located at the Foundation of Research and Technology Hellas (F.O.R.T.H.) which {{is considered to be a}} major scientific center worldwide. In 2008, during a visit at F.O.R.T.H the President of the Hellenic Republic, Karolos Papoulias was moved by her presentation and did something extraordinary: he bowed and kissed her hand to show his respect. Ioanna-Maria is one among the very few visually impaired / disabled researchers around the world and the only one, employed in Greece. Additionally, she is considered to be a rare case of a person who is blind since birth to exhibit visual synaesthesia. That is why, she is being asked to contribute to experiments, studies and projects regarding perception and the crossing of the senses. Every year, she is invited and participates in numerous conferences, arising matters varying from psychological research to guide dogs and contemporary issues as youth unemployment., Her knoweledge in psychology is often shared on newspapers and blogs. She was the first person to enter with her guide dog (and a dog in general), into the Hellenic Parliament and the European Parliament. In 2009, she protested through the web because her guide dog was denied in two reustaurants. She wrote a letter which went viral and caused great awareness. Following this incident, one year later a Spanish tourist named Antonia Pons Losada was not permitted into the new Acropolis Museum with her guide dog. As a result of local and international outcry regarding issues of guide dog access in Greece on August 2010, Ioanna contributed to the voting of the first national law, related to guide dogs. As soon as the law was approved by the Hellenic Parliament, she took her guide dog [...] "May" [...] and a Television crew for a visit to the Acropolis Museum. Today on the Museum's website we are informed that [...] "guide and assistance dogs, are welcome". According to the law 3868/2010, guide, assistance and therapy dogs are allowed practically everywhere in Greece. The law was recently reviewed, including guide/assistance/therapy dogs who are still in training and claryfing that they can enter into transportation means, without a muzzle. While transforming Greece into a role model for guide dog access, she joined the board of directors of the European Guide Dog Federation to defend the rights and access of guide dog teams, throughout the European Union. In 2013 at the European Parliament, she and former MEP Jorgo Chatzimarkakis were the main rapporteurs for the voting of an E.U. direction, aiming to promote <b>e-accessibility</b> on governmental websites. The direction was approved in 2014. Ioanna-Maria, was two times a political candidate.

40|$|<b>E-accessibility</b> is a {{cornerstone}} of the Inclusive Information Society for All. The valid and accurate measurement of <b>e-accessibility</b> provides an important basis {{for the development of}} human capital for socially sustainable growth. If so, then {{one of the most important}} questions is; how can eaccessibility be best measured? This question is very important for the issues considered in this conference, including; ageing and information and communication technologies, cultural diversity and information and communication technologies, geographic inclusion and information and communication technologies and inclusive public services. Accessibility is measured in a number of fields in a number of different ways. Those fields include; transport, architecture, employment, disability, web design and <b>e-accessibility.</b> For example, web accessibility is often measured by checklists as that provided by the World Wide Web Consortium (W 3 C), a governing body that sets standards for the technical development for the Web. Conversely, transportation studies employ more complex, quantitative measures. In this paper, a new model of measurement of <b>e-accessibility</b> is presented in which measures of accessibility are categorised as qualitative or quantitative (nominal, ordinal or interval) measures. On this basis, it is concluded that more powerful measures of <b>e-accessibility</b> are needed for both theoretical and practical reasons but that no single measure may be sufficient. The implications are evaluated for design for all for information society technology and e-learning. 1...|$|E

The audit was conducted in 2008 by the Human Computer Interaction Laboratory of the Institute of Computer Science of FORTH, in its capacity as the Greek National Contact Centre of the European Design for All <b>e-Accessibility</b> Network. In an earlier <b>e-Accessibility</b> study in 2004, that evaluated approximately 250 public and commercial Web sites in Greece, 73 % of the sample failed to meet the most basic requirements for web accessibility ([URL] Four years later, {{in the context of a}} re-audit, a similar sample was examined for compliance with the same web accessibility standard (WCAG 1. 0), as set by the Web Accessibility Initiative of the World Wide Web Consortium.

A comparison of the results indicates that although new web development technologies may have been employed, instead of improving the overall status of <b>e-accessibility,</b> this has resulted in a serious deterioration in overall accessibility levels. Such findings— 85 % of sites failed to comply with Level A—suggest that Greek Web sites are likely to present even more significant access barriers to people with disability than in the past. As Web Accessibility is poorly understood and, until today, new platforms have failed to deliver products that conform to WCAG, the need emerges for a concrete legislative framework to set accessibility specifications for all public Web sites in Greece...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} the World Wide Web is {{noticeable}} in organizations, businesses, societies, and individuals. When websites are evaluated, two important website qualities are examined, accessibility and usability. <b>E‐accessibility</b> is “a measure {{of the extent to}} which a product or service can be used by a person with a disability as effectively as it can be used by a person without that disability for purposes of accessing or using ICT related products or services” (Qatar’s <b>e‐Accessibility</b> Policy, 2011). Several studies have explored the accessibility status of websites and studied the effect of accessible websites on users, especially users with special needs. Many tools have been developed to automatically assess accessibility. It remains difficult to convince organizations to make their websites accessible. The author was motivated to explore if accessibility makes websites more usable. If such claim turns out to be true, it will become economically persuasive to convince website owners to invest in accessibility.

40|$|Access to the Internet {{has become}} a sine qua non-of {{everyday}} life. It also offers new routes to economic and social inclusion for disabled people. Research on the digital divide shows that social factors affect Internet access but disability status is often overlooked. This paper assesses {{the extent to which}} disability makes a difference and how it interacts with other social effects to produce distinctive forms of digital exclusion. The analysis uses survey data from 27 European countries to explore and model, statistically, the interactions between Internet access, disability status, age, gender, education, household financial situation and household composition. Multilevel analysis confirms that socio-demographic factors can explain much variance in outcomes but there is a distinctive disability effect. In particular, the adverse effects of financial constraint, aging and living alone are exacerbated among disabled people. New policies to strengthen <b>e-accessibility,</b> arising from the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and from the European Union, are important but cannot ignore those who are still excluded from the online revolution.

A comparison was carried out among 27 websites in three different languages (German, Dutch and Italian) in order to evaluate their accessibility and communicative adequacy, also with regard to the use of non-discriminatory language. The main hypothesis of the study is that different cultures show different awareness and sensitivity levels towards these issues, with such differences being reflected in the language and design of the websites. If this assumption of cultural differences is true, then translators can play an important social role by importing and disseminating the “best communicative practices”, and contrastive analyses of this kind can provide them with the necessary detailed knowledge...|$|E

Captions are placed manually close to the region of interest but it must avoid masking human faces, texts or any moving objects that might be relevant to the story flow. Our goal is to use image processing techniques to reduce the off-line caption production process by automatically placing the captions on the proper consecutive frames. We implemented a computer-assisted captioning software tool which integrates detection of faces, texts and visual motion regions. The near frontal faces are detected using a cascade of weak classifier and tracked through a particle filter. Then, frames are scanned to perform text spotting and build a region map suitable for text recognition. Finally, motion mapping {{is based on the}} Lukas-Kanade optical flow algorithm and provides MPEG- 7 motion descriptors.

In the specific case of people with low vision, efforts to improve <b>e-accessibility</b> are mainly focused on the provision of third-party tools. Assistive technologies like screen magnifiers adapt graphical user interfaces to increase the quality of the perceived information. However, when these technologies deal with the Web, they are not able to meet all specific needs of people with low vision. In this paper, we propose an approach to make Web pages more accessible for users with specific needs. User preferences can concern font size, font family, text color, word and letter spacing, link color and decoration or even more complex features regarding brightness, relative size or contrast. We also take into account and encode the designer’s graphical choices as designer preferences. Solving preferences of the user and of the designer to obtain a new Web page design is an optimization problem that we deal with Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), a polynomial Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm. We conducted detailed tests and evaluated the running time and quality of results of our tool on real Web pages.

Although a European Accessibility Act has yet to be enacted, several countries are rapidly moving towards an inclusive society, not only by eliminating physical obstacles, but also by enhancing the accessibility of information and communication. New technologies as well as comprehensibility of discourse make the difference in the field of eaccessibility. Against this background, we will investigate how communicative adequacy and inclusion are attempted in three European countries, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. Further, we will discuss to what extent multilingual and intercultural experts, translators included, might play a role in this inclusion process. In a previous study (Magris/Ross in press), we have explored web communication for people with disabilities in these three countries focusing on airport, hospital and library websites, with a special focus on <b>e-accessibility</b> and non-discriminatory language.
