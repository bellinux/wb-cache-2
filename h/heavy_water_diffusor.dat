25|$|Although {{many people}} {{associate}} <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> primarily with {{its use in}} nuclear reactors, pure <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> is not radioactive.

25|$|Due to its {{potential}} for use in nuclear weapons programs, the possession or import/export of large industrial quantities of <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> are subject to government control in several countries.

50|$|Recent {{investigation}} of production records at Norsk Hydro {{and analysis of}} an intact barrel that was salvaged in 2004 revealed that although the barrels in this shipment contained water of pH 14—indicative of the alkaline electrolytic refinement process, they did not contain high concentrations of D2O. Despite the apparent size of shipment, the total quantity of pure <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> was limited, with most barrels only containing between 1/2-1% pure <b>heavy</b> <b>water,</b> confirming {{the success of the}} Operation Gunnerside raid in destroying the higher purity <b>heavy</b> <b>water.</b> The Germans would have needed a total of about 5 t of <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> to get a nuclear reactor running; while the manifest indicated that there was only 500 kg of <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> being transported to Germany. Hence the Hydro was carrying too little <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> to supply one reactor, let alone the 10 or more tons of <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> needed to make enough plutonium for a nuclear weapon.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Heavy</b> <b>Water</b> Board (HWB) is a {{constituent}} unit under the Department of Atomic Energy in the Government of India.

500|$|Although a {{scientific}} curiosity from the start, considerable interest in <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> was aroused in 1939 when Hans von Halban and Lew Kowarski suggested that <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> {{could be used}} as a neutron moderator in a nuclear reactor using natural uranium. They carried out experiments on uranium using ordinary water, but had found that the hydrogen atoms absorbed neutrons, thus preventing the desired chain reaction. <b>Heavy</b> <b>water</b> though, was an ideal moderator. The Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) put Hugh S. Taylor, a British physicist at Princeton University in charge of <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> research. Taylor and Urey began looking at means for producing <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> on an industrial scale. For his plutonium project, Arthur H. Compton requested [...] of it.

40|$|The {{heating effect}} of {{terahertz}} pulse with various frequencies and intensities on the <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> solution is investigated using the molecular dynamics simulation.

This resonant phenomenon can be explained perfectly by the collective rotational modes that may release water molecules from hydrogen bonding. The findings not only illustrate the heating mechanism of <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> solution under the terahertz pulse irradiation, but also demonstrate a novel difference between light <b>water</b> and <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> that could have potential applications.

50|$|<b>Heavy</b> <b>water</b> {{differs from}} regular water {{in that the}} two atoms of {{hydrogen}} have been substituted with two atoms of deuterium, which is an isotope of hydrogen.

50|$|Harold Urey {{discovered}} the isotope deuterium in 1931 {{and was later}} able to concentrate it in water.

50|$|The Norwegian <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> {{sabotage}} (Tungtvannsaksjonen, Tungtvassaksjonen) was {{a series}} of actions undertaken by Norwegian saboteurs during World War II to prevent the German nuclear weapon project from acquiring <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> (deuterium oxide), which could have been used by the Germans to produce nuclear weapons. In 1934, at Vemork, Norway, Norsk Hydro built the first commercial plant capable of producing <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> as a byproduct of fertilizer production. It had a capacity of 12 t per year. During World War II, the Allies decided to remove the <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> supply and destroy the <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> plant in order to inhibit the German development of nuclear weapons.
