Following corrections for methodological differences, two samples (matched for age and overall body size) of male aircrew measured in 1971 (n = 220) and 2005 (n = 220) were compared across 13 absolute and proportional body dimensions. Changes in means were expressed as standardised effect sizes and changes in distributional characteristics were expressed as the ratio of coefficients of variation and as changes in skew. Small secular increases (standardised effects sizes > 0. 2) in age-matched aircrew were observed for mass, height, BMI, sitting height, buttock–knee length, waist girth, hip girth and waist:hip ratio, with a small decline observed for <b>head</b> <b>girth.</b> Changes in body dimensions were not independent of changes in overall body size (except for <b>head</b> <b>girth)</b> and were not always uniform across the distribution.

40|$|Human {{physique}} classification by somatotype {{assumes that}} adult humans are geometric similar to each other. However, this assumption {{has yet to}} be adequately tested in athletic and nonexercising human populations. In this study, we assessed this assumption by comparing the mass exponents associated with girth measurements taken at 13 different sites throughout the body in 478 subjects (279 athletic subjects, and 199 nonexercising controls). Corrected girths which account for subcutaneous adipose tissue at the upper arm, thigh, and calf sites, and which simulate muscle circumference, were also calculated. If subjects are geometrically similar to each other, girth exponents should be approximately proportional to M(1 / 3), where M is the subjects' body mass. This study confirms that human adult physiques are not geometrically similar to each other. In both athletic subjects and nonexercising controls, body circumferences/limb girths develop at a greater rate than that anticipated by geometric similarity in fleshy sites containing both muscle and fat (upper arms and legs), and less than anticipated in bony sites (head, wrists, and ankles). Interestingly, <b>head</b> <b>girths</b> appear to remain almost constant, irrespective of subjects' body size/mass. The results also suggest that thigh muscle girths of athletes and controls increase at a greater rate than that predicted by geometric similarity, proportional to body mass (M(0. 439) and M(0. 377), respectively). These systematic deviations from geometric similarity have serious implications for the allometric scaling of variables such as energy expenditure, oxygen uptake, anaerobic power, and thermodynamic or anthropometric studies involving individuals of differing size...|$|R

The traits studied were, days to emergence, days to 50 % flowering, days to maturity, plant height, leaf area, stem <b>girth,</b> <b>head</b> diameter, 1000 - seed weight, seeds head", oil content, seed and oil yield. The GE interaction, heritability estimates on plot and entry mean basis, general combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) effects were significant for all parameters. The SCA effects were of greater magnitude than GCA effects, which showed greater manifestation of non-additive gene effects. The GCA:SCA ratio also revealed predominance of non-additive gene effects. Performance of TS- 18 and TS- 335 among the CMS and TR- 5 and TR- 13 among the restorers was better for most of the traits. CMS lines TS- 4 and TS- 335 and restorer TR- 5 and TR- 6023 were better general combiners for most of the traits at both locations. Not a single cross combination showed consistent promising results for all traits, however, the cross combinations TS- 17 x TR- 3, TS- 335 x TR- 13, TS- 335 x TR- 3 and TS- 18 x TR- 5 showed higher specific combining ability effects for oil yield at Peshawar. At Mansehra TS- 335 x TR- 5, TS- 17 x TR- 6, TS- 4 x TR- 3 and TS- 18 x TR- 5 had higher specific combining ability effects for oil yield. Most of the crosses exhibited positive heterosis for all traits, however, some of the crosses also depicted negative but desirable heterosis for traits like days to emergence, days to flowering, days to maturity and plant height.

40|$|Abstract. — Selection {{curves of}} {{encircling}} (run-around) and drifting (stab) gill nets {{used in the}} winter fishery for Spanish mackerel Scomberomorus maculatus off southern Florida were estimated by use of cumulative probability distributions of retention girth at length. Selection curves cor-responded well with observed size frequencies obtained from each mesh size. Increasing differences between maximum and <b>head</b> <b>girth</b> perimeters as fish grew resulted in selection curves indicating increased selection range and efficiency. Selectivity of Spanish mackerel gill nets will change as {{the condition of the}} fish changes with the onset of the spawning season. Apparently, selectivity also changes with twine size. Spanish mackerel Scomberomorus maculatus are coastal migratory fish that concentrate in southern Florida during the winter (Collette and Russo 1984) and disperse northerly in a spawning mi-gration during spring and summer.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the prediction of scale mass via anthropometric skeletal measurements in a sample from 537 elite Caucasian athletes and controls. Eighteen skeletal dimensions were measured and log transformed, and along with gender, regressed against mass. The prediction was optimised as follows: Ln mass = 0. 6071 (ln <b>head</b> <b>girth)</b> + 0. 65303 (ln femur breadth) + 0. 65062 (ln ankle girth) + 0. 26724 (ln chest breadth) + 0. 17492 (ln A-P chest depth) + 0. 32479 (ln femur length) + 0. 31324 (biacromial breadth) - 5. 4611. Standard error of the estimate = 8. 3 %, R 2 (adjusted) = 84. 5 %, P< 0. 0001. High correlation between skeletal dimensions and body mass showed any of the variables could usefully predict mass, although the standard error of the estimate was higher (11. 7 – 14. 9 %). Variability in prediction accuracy is likely to result from differing muscle mass in this athletic sample, where muscle development is optimised for sports performance. ...|$|E

Twelve pairs of tall and dwarf near-isogenic lines developed in the diverse genetic background of three composites were evaluated for grain yield and yield components for 2 years at two locations in southern India. The d 2 gene or the genes linked to it, on an average, reduced plant height by 42 %, grain yield by 14 %, and <b>head</b> <b>girth</b> by 8 % but increased head length and number of tillers per plant by about 5 – 6 %. Large variations were observed among pairs (genetic background) for the difference between tall and dwarf near-isogenic lines for all of the above yield components resulting in no significant difference in five pairs and 17 – 35 % less yield in dwarfs as compared to their tall counterparts in six pairs. Days to 50 % flowering and seed weight were least affected by the d 2 gene with the average difference between tall and dwarf groups of near-isogenic lines being of the order of 1 – 2 %. These results indicate that the advantageous effects of d 2 dwarfing gene can be effectively exploited by manipulating the genetic background. The difference between the average grain yields of tall and dwarf groups of near-isogenic lines showed considerable variation across environments with the dwarfs yielding as much as tall group in one environment and up to 30 % less than the tall group in the other, thus, indicating that the d 2 gene effect may be substantially modified by the environments...|$|E
40|$|A {{complex and}} {{somewhat}} obscure satire celebrating {{the defeat of}} Dorrite Democrats in the Rhode Island state elections of spring 1843. The canvass was held the year following the successful suppression of the Dorrite Rebellion, an abortive revolt against the Charter government of Rhode Island, led by Thomas Wilson Dorr. (See "Tyrants Prostrate Liberty Triumphant," no. 1844 - 19). Yet the 1843 Democratic slate included many radicals sympathetic to Dorr and {{was seen as a}} challenge to the reigning conservative Law and Order Party. "Trouble in the Spartan Ranks" ridicules the Dorrites on several fronts, from Dorr's enlistment of help in his cause from the Spartan Band, a New York City gang of toughs, to the makeup of their local constituency. "Old Durham" is the newly elected governor, septuagenarian James Fenner (lower right), shown as a stout man with large horns and bull's ears. He tosses the rebel leader on his horns. Dorr has one cloven hoof (a satanic attribute) and is armed with "That Sword," a prop which he employed in a famous May 1842 speech against the Charter government. He says, "Leave my Bones on Accots hill. " (Acote's Hill, in the town of Chepachet, was the site of the Dorrite troop encampment {{at the time of their}} surrender in June 1842.) In the margin below, is an explanatory text phrased in mock-biblical style: Chronicles 11 - 1. And it came to pass anno domini 1843. A special season of humbug and fanaticism. That interlopers from Cape Cod and the Spartan Band of the Pewter Mug of York. And a few demigogues seeking office caricatured in print, the true R. Island nominee as "The Durham Bull" having horns upon his <b>head,</b> <b>girth</b> like unto the ox surly and uncouth. 2 d ver. Prognosticating, Albeit that "old Durham with his horns" and the horns of Millerism would fall in disgrace together in April 1843. [For Millerism see "The Salamander Safe," no. 1843 - 5]. 3 d ver. Mark their error and the sequel... Fenner is solicited by a man in a long coat on the right who says, "Lordy, Gody Govr haint I alrers been your freend. Now do for massey sake and the Corporals save the Sover-in-ity. If the Sover-inity aint in the People where is it? as Slocum says. " Fenner is pointing with his whip to a banner held by a knight in armor (center) bearing the arms of the state. The banner shows Father Time, with his characteristic attributes, an hourglass and a snake grasping its own tail, and reads: "April 1843. It is Written on the Tombstone of Eternity Dorrism shall be no more in Rhode-Island. " The banner hangs from a staff with an eagle and motto, "Law and Order Shall be sustained in R. I. " The knight is preceded by a motley group of men with the banner, "Squad No. 2 Liberty or Oregon Delegation From 3 d, 5 h & 6 h Wards & Burrillville. " The three Providence wards and Burrillville were strongholds of reformist support. The men have their ward numbers and an initial on their hats and are no doubt Dorrite Democrats. One of the shortest and most unkempt of them, with a clay pipe protruding from his vest pocket, is an Irishman, a specimen of the new tradesmen and working-class immigrants who swelled the ranks of the reformist Democrats. Also on their banner is a black man thumbing his nose and saying, "Oregon! dats up Salt River By hokey. " (The reoccupation of Oregon became an important plank in the Democratic platform of 1844.) Attached to the group is a dwarf whose trousers are torn by a dog. He is a member of the Spartan Band, carrying a flag reading, "The Banks & Beauty of Providence Spartan Band, N. York. " He complains, "These Rhode Island Dogs are a pull-back to our designs and quite disorganize our fundamental arrangements. " Ahead of the group is another, bearded dwarf with a drum. He has one peg leg and the other with a cloven hoof. He exhorts the group, "Go it you Algerine cripples," a phrase combining an old Democratic campaign cry with reference to the Algerine Law, an 1842 act outlawing Dorrite activity as treason. At the lower left a tiny seamstress scrutinizes through a glass a ragged, lanky tough holding a spear and clay pipe who says, "Ize one of the Spartan Band. Bee's you one of the Ladies Dorrick Circle?" Behind them is the Providence Armory, which was attacked by the Dorrites during the rebellion. It is well guarded and flies banners saying, "Law and Order the Foundation of Democracy" and " 9 Cheers for Old Durham, horns and all. "C. Maolsehber del. Entered... 1843 by Wm. Andrews...
