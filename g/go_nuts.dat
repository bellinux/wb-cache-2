I'd bring in 'My Generation'. At the end of the song, the drums <b>go</b> <b>nuts.</b> 'My Generation' was a turning point for me because before that it was all the Charlie Watts and Ringo type of thing." ...|$|E
500|$|During the {{creation}} of [...] God of War, the game's director David Jaffe attempted to create a version of Kratos that looked brutal but had a different appearance from what {{is considered to be}} the traditional Greek hero. The character's traditional armor was removed to show the character's individualism, and details such as hair and other [...] "flowing things" [...] were removed. Jaffe said of his final version of the character, that while [...] " [...] may not totally feel at home in Ancient Greece from a costume standpoint, I think he achieves the greater purpose which is to give players a character who they can play who really does just let them <b>go</b> <b>nuts</b> and unleash the nasty fantasies that they have in their head." ...|$|E

500|$|As a child, Mars {{spent time}} impersonating Elvis Presley. This playact {{had a major}} impact on his musical evolution; he later reflected: I watch the best. I'm a big fan of Elvis. I'm a big fan of 1950s Elvis when he would go on stage and scare people because he was a force and girls would <b>go</b> <b>nuts!</b> You can say the same thing for Prince or The Police. It's just guys who know that people are here to see a show, so I watch those guys and I love {{studying}} them because I'm a fan." [...] He also impersonated Michael Jackson and Little Richard, both of whom are major inspirations of his. Mars was raised on his father’s doo-wop collection — “simple four-chord songs that got straight to the point” and on Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis,and Frankie Lymon. The hip-hop productions by The Neptunes and Timbaland, that were played on the radio constantly, also influenced him.|$|E
500|$|Charlie Wen, {{director}} of visual development on God of War and God of War II, {{is responsible for}} designing Kratos. Wen said that his direction for designing Kratos was as much influenced by similarly themed films as it was by pop culture, which led him to sketch a series of images of Kratos on napkins at a restaurant, introducing {{the idea of the}} double-chained blades and eventually Kratos' iconic design. Double-chained blades were chosen as Kratos' signature weapon because they emphasized the character's animal nature while also allowing combat to remain fluid. Jaffe said of the final version of [...] the character, [...] " [...] may not totally feel at home in Ancient Greece from a costume standpoint, I think he achieves the greater purpose which is to give players a character who they can play who really does just let them <b>go</b> <b>nuts</b> and unleash the nasty fantasies that they have in their head." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Pour Me", {{the last}} soft {{song on the}} album, is a dark ballad that has been often {{compared}} to Eminem's [...] "Stan". Johnny3Tears stated that, [...] "We were messing around with chord progressions and that came out like a more major chord style than we were used to it. It's melodic and poppy sounding. We're talking about drinking obviously because all of us sometimes drink too much. It's one of those basic every day things that people go through but they don't know how to voice it or others around them don't know to voice it. It's almost like you're looked down upon, but no one actually talks about it." [...] "Tendencies", which is the closing track for the standard edition of the album, is a high tempo alternative metal song about murder. Johnny3Tears said, [...] "When we wrote Tendencies, I {{wanted to make a}} song that kids would just <b>go</b> <b>nuts</b> to when we played it. Kids start moshpits at our shows. Not every song we have is the best mosh song, so I wanted to make a song kids could go crazy for." ...|$|E

500|$|GameSpot's Mc Shea found Second Sons open world {{beholden to}} a dated formula. He {{described}} Seattle as [...] "a playground {{for you to}} <b>go</b> <b>nuts</b> in" [...] instead of [...] "a living, breathing world", with the Seattleites existing only as fodder for players. CVGs Hussain called Seattle [...] "hauntingly empty", with the sparsely distributed NPCs behaving inanimately. He felt that the open world's lifelessness was the game's biggest detractor, and he drew unfavorable comparison with Grand Theft Auto V, Sleeping Dogs and , which he felt featured better open worlds. Eurogamer's Welsh felt that Second Son did not innovate the open world genre {{as well as it}} could have because it relied too heavily on many of the genre's tropes. Polygon's Kollar felt that there was not enough variation in the missions and activities, as [...] "virtually all culminate in the goal of beating up more soldiers or thugs". Edge found the amount of content in the game thin, finding little merit in additional playthroughs because of the repetitive side-missions. [...] "Approach [...] as an action game that just happens to be set in a nonlinear environment and it makes more sense", they wrote. Destructoid's Carter found the amount of content ample, and enjoyed liberating the city and collecting Blast Shards.|$|E
500|$|The diverse {{sources of}} funding {{meant that the}} {{production}} team had to field opinions from various sources. Millesime was unhappy with {{certain aspects of the}} story, for instance wanting the entire Lyme sequence removed because they considered it [...] "too boring". WGBH gave the BBC detailed notes, which were then integrated into the script. One change concerned the ending. To display the climax when Anne and Wentworth finally approach each other with their feelings, two different scenes were shot, one in which they kiss and one in which they do not. Dear first wrote a scene closely modelled after Austen's ending: Anne reunites with Wentworth on the streets of Bath, and the two exchange words and hold hands. Eaton felt that after hours of waiting, audiences [...] "would <b>go</b> <b>nuts</b> with frustration and irritation" [...] if the two did not kiss. Eaton also thought [...] "a kiss would be an emotional pay-off", and WGBH believed it would give the film a wider appeal. Michell agreed to compromise, opting to shoot one British version and one American version—the latter included the kiss. The American ending is reflected on the international poster, which shows the two protagonists embracing. While the kiss attracted some criticism among fans, actress Amanda Root defended it. [...] "After the great suspense of the story, by the end you're desperate for Anne and Captain Wentworth to get together, desperate! Film is a visual medium, after all. You don't necessarily want to see them in bed together, but you do want to see something like a kiss", she said.|$|E
500|$|Peter Buck's {{style of}} playing guitar has {{been singled out}} {{by many as the}} most {{distinctive}} aspect of R.E.M.'s music. During the 1980s, Buck's [...] "economical, arpeggiated, poetic" [...] style reminded British music journalists of 1960s American folk rock band The Byrds. Buck has stated [...] " [...] Roger McGuinn was a big influence on me as a guitar player", but said it was Byrds-influenced bands, including Big Star and The Soft Boys, that inspired him more. Comparisons were also made with the guitar playing of Johnny Marr of alternative rock contemporaries The Smiths. While Buck professed being a fan of the group, he admitted he initially criticized the band simply because he was tired of fans asking him if he was influenced by Marr, whose band had in fact made their debut after R.E.M. Buck generally eschews guitar solos; he explained in 2002, [...] "I know that when guitarists rip into this hot solo, people <b>go</b> <b>nuts,</b> but I don't write songs that suit that, and I am not interested in that. I can do it if I have to, but I don't like it." [...] Mike Mills' melodic approach to bass playing is inspired by Paul McCartney of The Beatles and Chris Squire of Yes; Mills has said, [...] "I always played a melodic bass, like a piano bass in some ways [...] [...] [...] I never wanted to play the traditional locked into the kick drum, root note bass work." [...] Mills has more musical training than his bandmates, which he has said [...] "made it easier to turn abstract musical ideas into reality." ...|$|E

2500|$|Soul-Crusher {{continued}} {{to develop the}} punk-like noise rock style of its predecessor. The record's sound {{has been described as}} [...] "Beefheart in painfully tight trousers trying to scream his way over Sonic Youth and The Birthday Party playing different songs in the same room." [...] Sean has cited The Cramps, The Birthday Party, Flipper, Butthole Surfers, and Black Flag as primary influences to the band during this time. She said, [...] "I would write bass riffs that were very driving and tribal with Ivan’s drums, very Birthday Party and Butthole Surfers-influenced. Then sometimes we would just tell Tom to <b>go</b> <b>nuts</b> and make some noise!". Guay also created entire tracks of guitar feedback and noise, which didn't relate to any of the songs, that the band would proceed to layer over the album. Rob would usually work out the lyrics and vocal arrangement after the music had already been written, sometimes even waiting until the band was in the studio to finish the song. He felt that the band had finally solidified into a unit and that the record perfectly showcased their sound during that era more so than anything else they had recorded before, although he was very critical of the band's music and the noise rock genre at the time, going as far as to say: ...|$|E
