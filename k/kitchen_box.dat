50|$|Clockworks {{are often}} {{powered by a}} {{clockwork}} motor consisting of a mainspring, a spiral torsion spring of metal ribbon. Energy is stored in the mainspring manually by winding it up, turning a key attached to a ratchet which twists the mainspring tighter. Then {{the force of the}} mainspring turns the clockwork's gears, until the stored energy is used up.

50|$|A {{mainspring}} is {{a spiral}} torsion spring of metal ribbon—commonly spring steel—used {{as a power}} source in mechanical watches, some clocks, and other clockwork mechanisms. Winding the timepiece, by turning a knob or key, stores energy in the mainspring by twisting the spiral tighter. The force of the mainspring then turns the clock's wheels as it unwinds, until the next winding is needed. The adjectives wind-up and spring-powered refer to mechanisms powered by mainsprings, which also include <b>kitchen</b> timers, music <b>boxes,</b> wind-up toys and clockwork radios.|$|R

50|$|The {{house is}} {{estimated}} to have been built c. 1720-26 for {{a member of the}} locally-prominent Abbot family. In its original form it consisted of one room {{on each side of the}} central chimney, with a narrow winding staircase between the entrance vestibule and the chimney. This staircase has retained one of its original newel posts; the railings are modern replacements. Architectural evidence of its early construction date include quirk-beaded main beams and gunstock-shaped posts at the corners on the second floor. The chamber on the west side was likely the kitchen, with a large fireplace that has since been closed off. This space was later subdivided to form a closet, bathroom, and hallway leading to the modern addition to the rear. Both the parlor (to the east of the chimney) and the parlor chamber above it feature high-quality wood paneling, and the framing members (exposed in the <b>kitchen</b> chamber) are <b>boxed.</b>|$|R
