40|$|Accelerated {{ultraviolet}} weathering of unplasticized poly (vinyl chloride) (UPVC) filled composites {{with different}} filler contents of oil palm empty fruit bunch (EFB) was studied. The unfilled and filled composites samples were manufactured by <b>dry-blending</b> PVC, EFB fillers and other additives in a heavy-duty laboratory mixer. The dry-blended compounds were then two-roll milled and hot pressed into samples. The composites samples {{were exposed to}} cyclic ultraviolet fluorescent lamps/condensation for 504 h of accelerated weathering. Each assessment consisted of SEM analysis, impact and flexural testing, visual inspection and FTIR analysis. The experimental results indicated that EFB fillers accelerated photo-oxidative degradation of the UPVC matrix. Although filled composites exhibited greater discolouration than unfilled composites, their impact and flexural properties changed only slightly after accelerated weathering...|$|E
40|$|A {{simple and}} easy {{technique}} is {{proposed for the}} preparation of dry hexamethylenediammonium adipate (HMA salt), using conventional <b>dry-blending</b> equipment. The process includes contacting adipic acid and hexamethylenediamine, {{in the presence of}} a cryogenic medium, which is used to depress the exothermic of the salt formation. The purpose is the formation of free-flowing HMA salt with good homogeneity and balanced end groups, which can be used as a starting intermediate in the polyamide industry. Critical parameters were studied, such as the nature and amount of cryogenic agent and the presence of water traces in the reacting mixture. Application in an industrial scale seems feasible so that all advantages of handling dry HMA salt instead of its components (adipic acid powder and hexamethylenediamine liquid) can be utilized.

40|$|Thermoplastic starch (TPS) /wood {{composites}} {{were prepared}} from starch plasticized with 36 wt% glycerol. The components were homogenized by <b>dry-blending,</b> extruded and injection molded to tensile bars. Tensile properties, structure, deformation, water adsorption and shrinkage were determined {{as a function}} of wood content, which changed between 0 and 40 vol% in 7 steps. The modification of TPS with wood particles improves several properties considerably. Stiffness and strength increases, and the effect is stronger for fibers with larger aspect ratio. Wood fibers reinforce TPS considerably due to poor ma-trix properties and strong interfacial interactions, the latter resulting in the decreased mo-bility of starch molecules and in the fracture of large wood particles during deformation. Strong interfacial adhesion leads to smaller water absorption than predicted from additivity, but water uptake remains relatively large even in the presence of wood particles. The shrinkage of injection molded TPS parts is very large, around 10 %, and dimensional changes occur on a very long timescale of several hundred hours. Shrinkage decreases to a low level already at 15 - 20 vol% wood content rendering the composites good dimensional stability...|$|E

40|$|Silica {{supported}} {{chromium oxide}} catalysts, known as Phillips catalysts, {{are used in}} the production of over 40 % of the world's high-density polyethylene. The original catalyst comprised CrO(_ 3) impregnated onto silica. Due to the carcinogenic nature of chromium(VI), chromium(m) catalyst precursors which are oxidised during calcination are now preferred. Two such precursors have been employed throughout the studies reported in this thesis; one is prepared by the aqueous impregnation of a silica support with basic chromium(in) acetate, whilst the other comprises a <b>dry-blended</b> mixture of chromium(m) acetylacetonate with silica. Calcination of the two precursors has been studied using a combination of temperature-programmed quadrupole mass spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy. The chromium(III) acetylacetonate precursor is postulated to disperse near its melting point and react via an acetate intermediate. Both precursors may therefore be expected to produce the same catalyst following calcination. The study of subsequent CO reduction of these calcined catalysts by quadrupole mass spectrometry supports this observation. The reduction is found to proceed via a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, both precursors demonstrating the same behaviour. Activation energies for the catalyst reduction have been determined from the corresponding Arrhenius plots. Quadrupole mass spectrometry techniques have identified 1 -hexene production during the early stages of polymerization using the CO reduced catalysts. This indicates the formation of a chromacyclopentane intermediate species which may also be involved in the mitiation of polymerization. The continuous fragmentation of the catalyst support and polymer growth have been investigated using contact mode and phase-imaging atomic force microscopy. Non-equilibrium plasma oxidation of the two catalyst precursors has been studied by quadrupole mass spectrometry. An active catalyst is obtained from the chromium(m) acetate catalyst, however the <b>dry-blended</b> chromium(in) acetylacetonate precursor is unable to achieve the dispersion required, and the oxidised species are inactive for ethylene polymerization...|$|R

This work has utility for applications that require a reduction in mechanical wear and/or to confer upon a polymeric deposit a certain functional property by the introduction of value-added powder. Free-standing coatings were produced to test the mechanical properties of the sprayed deposit. The effects of the filler content on the secant modulus, yield stress, and tensile strength are discussed. The differences in deposition efficiencies among the EMAA, Al 2 O 3, and NiCr are highlighted with respect to particle size and density...|$|R
40|$|The {{withdrawal}} {{strength of}} nail and screw fasteners {{has been studied}} in rice straw fibre-thermoplastic composites. Two types of thermoplastic, virgin polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP), were selected as separate composite matrices. Three levels of dry rice straw fibre, 45 %, 60 % and 75 %, based on the composition by weight and passed through a 40 -mesh size screen was mixed with the polymeric matrices without and with 2 % (based on weight) maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MAPP) as Coupling agent. A <b>dry-blending</b> method was used for compounding the materials. The 12 formulations for the polymer composites were used to prepare samples with dimensions 25 cm by 15 cm by I cm. The final composites were made by pressing the prepared mats between the hot plates of a compression press by employing combinations of temperature and pressure in three stages. After keeping the composites {{at room temperature for}} 15 days, the withdrawal strengths of nails and screws were measured according to BS Standard (CEN/TS 15534 - 1 : 2007) for dry composites. Withdrawal strengths were also measured after immersion of the composites for 24 h in distilled water (wet condition). The results showed that the withdrawal strength of screws is more than that of nails. Also, irrespective of the type of polymer, the percentage of rice straw fibre may significantly influence the withdrawal strength of fasteners, especially at the higher fibre to polymer ratios. Furthermore, it was found that in the wet condition the withdrawal strengths of the flail fasteners are reduced more (73. 66 %) than for the screws (28. 9 %) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} {{and testing of}} a new technique for blending of electrolyte-binder (separator) mixes for use in thermal batteries is described. The original method of blending such materials at Sandia involved liquid Freon TF' as a medium. The ban {{on the use of}} halogenated solvents throughout much of the Department of Energy complex required the development of an alternative liquid medium as a replacement. The use of liquid nitrogen (LN) was explored and developed into a viable quality process. For comparison, a limited number of <b>dry-blending</b> tests were also conducted using a Turbula mixer. The characterization of pellets made from LN-blended separators involved deformation properties at 530 C and electrolyte-leakage behavior at 400 or 500 C, as well as performance in single-cells and five-cell batteries under several loads. Stack-relaxation tests were also conducted using 10 -cell batteries. One objective of this work was to observe if correlations could be obtained between the mechanical properties of the separators and the performance in single cells and batteries. Separators made using three different electrolytes were examined in this study. These included the LiCl-KCl eutectic, the all-Li LiCl-LiBr-LiF electrolyte, and the low-melting LiBr-KBr-LiF eutectic. The electrochemical performance of separator pellets made with LN-blended materials was compared to that for those made with Freon T P and, in some cases, those that were dry blended. A satisfactory replacement MgO (Marinco 'OL', now manufactured by Morton) was qualified as a replacement for the standard Maglite 'S' MgO that has been used for years but is no longer commercially available. The separator compositions with the new MgO were optimized and included in the blending and electrochemical characterization tests...|$|E

40|$|Awareness of the {{advantages}} of natural fibres has stimulated interest in their use to reinforce polymers. One type of natural fibre that is of great relevance to Malaysia is oil palm empty fruit bunches (EFB). To produce EFB-filled unplasticized poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) composites, PVC resin and the various additives were first <b>dry-blended</b> using a laboratory blender before being milled into sheets on a two-roll mill. Test specimens were then hot pressed, alter which the mechanical and thermal properties were determined. Four untreated EFB fibre contents were employed, 10, 20, 30 and 40 phr. The increase in EPB fibre content resulted in an improvement in flexural modulus at the expense of impact strength and flexural strength. The incorporation of EFB slightly enhanced the glass transition temperature but it decreased the thermal stability of the composites, evidenced by a decrease in decomposition temperature and a change in the degradation process from two to three stages...|$|R

40|$|Approximately 80 % of {{pharmaceutical}} products and the ingredients required for their manufacture are in powder form. The solid dosage form (tablets and capsules) is manufactured by either <b>dry-blending</b> of fine powder ingredients or combining {{the ingredients in}} a wet granulation step, followed by drying. Arching, ratholing, caking, segregation and flooding {{are some of the}} commonly encountered flow problems in the handling of fine powders. These problems lead to losses worth thousands of dollars at production scale. Poor powder flowability is a consequence of the combined effects of many variables, including improper equipment design, particle size, size distribution, shape, moisture content and surface texture. In the present work, a systematic study has been performed to determine the relationship between the flowability of fine powders and their physical properties of mean size and size distribution, density and shape. Flowability studies were done on six different powders: the NutraSweet® Brand sweetener (aspartame), Respitose ML 001, Alpha-D-Lactose monohydrate, the pharmaceutical binder Methocel (R) F 50 Premium Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose- HPMC, a placebo pharmaceutical granulate, and common pastry flour. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and stereomicroscopy were used for particle shape and size analysis. Particle size distribution was determined using the laser light scattering technique. Powder flowability was measured using shear strength, angle of repose, and tapped-to-bulk density measurements. A novel method of measuring the dynamic angle of repose using electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) was developed. Analysis of the images from microscopy revealed that the particles of aspartame and HPMC powders were elongated, the particles of ML 001, pastry flour and lactose monohydrate powders were irregular, and the particles of placebo granulate were nearly spherical. Particle size was found to be the most reliable indicator of powder flowability, with decreasing particle size corresponding to lower flowability; however other parameters such as particle elongation and irregularity, were also found to have an influence on powder flowability. Although HPMC and pastry flour had similar particle sizes, they exhibited differences in flowability. This {{can be explained by the}} greater irregularity of the flour particles. Particle irregularity may cause mechanical interlocking between the particles, thus reducing powder flowability. ECT was found to be a promising non-intrusive tool for the measurement of the dynamic angle of repose. Unlike other methods for the measurement of dynamic angle of repose, the results obtained from ECT were not influenced by the effect of end caps. The present technique could be used by pharmaceutical industries in process analytical technology (PAT) for the detection and elimination of potential flow problems early in the manufacturing process...|$|E

To produce the composites, the PVC resin, fillers, and other additives were <b>dry-blended</b> in a laboratory mixer before being milled into sheets by using a tworoll mill. Test specimens were prepared by compression molding, after which the thermal properties and processability of the composites were determined. Single and hybrid filler loadings used were fixed at 30 phr (parts per hundred parts of resin). Talc-filled PVC composite showed slightly better thermal stability and rigidity than the composite filled with SM 90, and its thermal stability and rigidity slightly decreased with SM 90 content increasing from 5 to 25 phr in order to replace talc filler in the hybrid composites. The fusion time of talc-filled PVC composite was shorter than that of SM 90 -filled PVC composite; thus, the fusion time of hybrid composites increased with increasing SM 90...|$|R

Our overall objective has been to develop cost-effective flame-retarded and antistatic polyethylene compounds suitable for rotomolding. This communication considers the surface resistivity and mechanical properties of rotationally molded linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) /graphite composites containing natural Zimbabwean graphite, expandable graphite, or expanded graphite. Dry blending and melt compounding were employed to obtain antistatic composites at the lowest graphite contents. Dry blending {{was found to be}} an effective mixing method for rotomolding antistatic LLDPE/graphite composites, thereby eliminating an expensive compounding step. <b>Dry-blended</b> Zimbabwean graphite composites showed the lowest surface resistivity at all graphite contents, with a surface resistivity of 105 Ω/square at 10 wt% loading. Although rotomolded powders obtained following the melt compounding of Zimbabwean graphite exhibited higher resistivity values, the variability was much lower.

Two processing methods were employed: (I) masterbatch (MB) preparation in a TSE (with 10 wt% C 20 A and clay/compatibilizer ratio of 1 : 2), followed by dilution in TSE, SSE, or SSE + EFM, to 2 wt% clay loading; (II) single pass, i. e., directly compounding of <b>dry-blended</b> PP-g-MA/clay in TSE, SSE, or SSE + EFM.

The objectives {{of this study are}} to investigate the effects of extracted EFB on processability, impact, and flexural properties of PVC-U composites. A soxhlet extraction was used to extract the extractives from the EFB fibers. The identification of the related functional groups present in the concentrated extract was analyzed using FTIR.

Cheddar cheese whey was ultrafiltered. The 18 % protein retentate was subjected to protein hydrolysis using Neutrase. The hydrolyzed retentate was further condensed to 35 % total solids and spray-dried at 75 oC outlet air temperature. Different levels of sugar, citric acid and stabilizer were blended for spray-dried hydrolysates. Spray-dried hydrolysate was further inoculated with different levels of probiotics grown in a whey medium and dried in fluidized-bed drier at 40 oC to obtain a ready-to-reconstitute beverage. Hydrolysis was greatest at an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1 : 25 for 3 h. Spray-dried hydrolysate reconstituted to 1 % protein and blended with 15 % sugar, 0. 2 % citric acid and 0. 15 % xantham gum resulted in a superior product with no sedimentation.

Also, the pure unmodified milk fat, {{and the soft}} (SBF 23), medium (SBF 27) and hard (SBF 42) fractions of the same were transformed into powder by spray chilling the molten samples. The effect of chilling with air and nitrogen was investigated. The powders were satisfactorily stable at 5 °C, but were relatively unstable at ambient temperatures. The powders' particle size distributions ranged from 4. 44 to 215. 56 μm. The powder characteristics were influenced {{by the size of}} the nozzle, the atomising gas pressure, the chilling temperature, the feed flow rate, and to a lesser extent, the feed temperature. The shelf life of the unmodified milk fat powders stored at 20 °C, 5 °C and - 10 °C was assessed. The powders chilled with air had excessively oxidised after one month of storage at all the temperatures, whereas powders processed with nitrogen were still usable after the same period of storage. Lower peroxide values were recorded for the powders stored at - 10 °C and 5 °C, while significantly higher values were obtained for the samples stored at 20 °C. The powdered fats <b>dry-blended</b> successfully with skim milk and calcium caseinate powders at the ambient temperature.

40|$|Starch is {{a natural}} polymer {{occurring}} in the seeds, tubers and stems of many plants, including maize. It {{is a mixture of}} two polymers: linear amylose and highly branched amylopectin. The ratio and the molar masses of the two polymers depend on the starch source, giving rise to different starch properties. Thermoplastic starch (TPS) was obtained by gelatinising a <b>dry-blend</b> mixture of maize starch, water, plasticisers and additives in a single-screw laboratory extruder. The TPS formed is a translucent amorphous material that could be shaped into pellets and injection-moulded into a variety of articles, just like conventional plastics [Shogren et al., 1994]. The advantages of TPS are that it is cheap and fully biodegradable. However, because of its hydrophilic nature, its properties and dimensional stability are influenced by moisture (humidity). It is also not easily processed like conventional plastics and the freshly moulded material ages, i. e. its properties change over time. The latter is caused by retrogradational structural changes which include helix formation and the crystallisation that occurs above the glass transition temperature [Myllärinen et al., 2002]. The unacceptable physical and processing properties of TPS were improved by blending with other polymers. The objective of this work was {{to determine the effects of}} water and glycerol content and the starch source or type on the mechanical properties of maize-based TPS. In addition, the effect of gypsum filler and polyamides or polyvinyl butyral (PVB) as modifying agent was also investigated. The PVB was based on material recycled from automotive windscreens. As with the thermoplastic starch, the thermoplastic/polymer blends, e. g. polyvinyl butyral, were also prepared using a single-screw extruder. After pelletisation, the materials were conditioned at 30 °C and a relative humidity of 60 %. Tensile test specimens were prepared by injection moulding. Samples were characterised using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and tensile testing. The effect of environmental conditions (temperature and humidity or water submersion) on the ageing of the samples was investigated using tensile properties as a measure. Initial extrusion and moulding trials revealed that the TPS compounds were very difficult to process. Difficulties were encountered with feeding the dry blends into the compounding extruder. The moulded samples adhered strongly to the mould walls, especially the sprue part. These problems were overcome by adding 2, 5 % precipitated silica to improve the flowability of the dry blends and stearyl alcohol at ca. 1, 5 % as a processing aid. The latter performed as an external lubricant and mould-release agent. Nevertheless, for some compositions it was also necessary to use ‘Spray-and-Cook’ as mould-release agent during injection moulding. The results show that HiMaizeTM, a high-amylose maize starch, provided the best properties in TPS and its blends. Further improvements in properties were obtained by blending with low-molecular-weight hot-melt adhesive-grade polyamides (Euremelt 2138 and 2140), engineering polyamide (EMS Grilon CF 62 BSE) or low amounts of PVB. The properties of all the compounds investigated were affected by moisture content and also by ageing. The TPS-PVB blends showed highly non-linear composition-dependence. SEM and DMA revealed a phase separation for all the TPS-PVB blend compositions investigated. The tensile properties were negatively affected by ageing in a high-humidity environment and they deteriorated rapidly when the samples were soaked in water. Synergistic property enhancement was observed for a compound containing 22 % thermoplastic starch. It featured a higher tensile strength, showed better water resistance and was significantly less affected by ageing. At higher PVB levels, the property dropped to values that were lower than expected from the linear blending rule. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2008.
