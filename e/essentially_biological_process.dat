Most recently, the grant of patents for plants resulting from <b>essentially</b> <b>biological</b> <b>processes,</b> notably tomatoes with reduced fruit water content and broccoli with anti-cancer potential, spurred stormy disputes.

40|$|The {{grant of}} the right of patent to an {{invention}} is vested in the statutory inventor, employer, commissioner of a work, assignee or licensee. For this right of patent to be granted the invention must be patentable. Patentable inventions are inventions in respect of which patent is granted under the law. Patent is regulated in Nigeria by the Patents and Designs Act (PDA) 2004, which protects inventions that fall within patentable subject matter. An invention is deemed patentable if it is new, results from inventive activity and is capable of industrial application; or if it constitutes an improvement upon a patented invention and it is also new, results from an inventive activity and is capable of industrial application. However, not all inventions are patentable, some are non-patentable and they include plant or animal varieties or <b>essentially</b> <b>biological</b> <b>processes</b> (other than microbiological processes) for the production of plants and animals; or inventions that are contrary to public order or morality...|$|R

40|$|This article {{provides}} an in-depth {{critical analysis of}} pressing issues regarding the patentability of plants. There is no public interest overarching principle present in the European Patent Convention or any other convention for that matter which would exclude patent protection for plants. The expansionist behavior of some users of the patent system seeking to obtain patent protection for methods and products which are very akin to traditional breeding methods needs to be halted and patent applications in that context deserve very close scrutiny {{so as to avoid}} that the border is crossed. Patents for hybrid seeds ought not to be protected by patents, as they in effect protect plant varieties as such. If the patent system is not capable of keeping such innovations outside of the patent territory, the call for excluding all plant-related innovations from patentability will become more influential. Products produced by <b>essentially</b> <b>biological</b> <b>processes</b> should not be patentable. However, {{in the absence of a}} statutory basis, the current legal framework does not allow the judiciary to come to such conclusion. The EPC needs to be amended in this respect. Finally, introducing a breeders' exemption in the patent system could jeopardize the internal and external architecture of the patent system and one should be wary of introducing it...|$|R

30|$|Cancer {{occurrence}} {{is widespread}} across multicellular eukaryotes. It {{is common in}} virtually all animals, though less so in plants and fungi. Only a few multicellular organisms {{are known to be}} highly cancer resistant, such as the naked mole rat [17]. Therefore, cancer can be considered as an <b>essentially</b> universal <b>biological</b> <b>process</b> occurring in multicellular eukaryotic organisms. Furthermore, cancer incidence occurs in organisms that remain intrinsically cellular in their respective responses to the environment across evolutionary development as holobionic life forms despite their macroscopic phenotypic appearances. Therefore, it is appropriate to assert that cancer that occurs in holobionic and intrinsically cellular life, as the exclusive macroscopic form on the planet, must represent a derivative cellular process whose evolutionary unfolding should center within similar cellular contexts.|$|R
5|$|In chemistry, {{one central}} issue was the {{distinction}} between organic and inorganic substances, especially {{in the context of}} organic transformations such as fermentation and putrefaction. Since Aristotle these had been considered <b>essentially</b> <b>biological</b> (vital) <b>processes.</b> However, Friedrich Wöhler, Justus Liebig and other pioneers of the rising field of organic chemistry—building on the work of Lavoisier—showed that the organic world could often be analyzed by physical and chemical methods. In 1828 Wöhler showed that the organic substance urea could be created by chemical means that do not involve life, providing a powerful challenge to vitalism. Cell extracts ("ferments") that could effect chemical transformations were discovered, beginning with diastase in 1833. By the end of the 19th century the concept of enzymes was well established, though equations of chemical kinetics would not be applied to enzymatic reactions until the early 20th century.|$|R
40|$|<b>Essentially</b> all <b>biological</b> <b>processes</b> {{depend on}} protein–protein {{interactions}} (PPIs). Timing of such interactions {{is crucial for}} regulatory function. Although circadian (, 24 -hour) clocks constitute fundamental cellular timing mechanisms regulating important physiological processes, PPI dynamics on this timescale are largely unknown. Here, we identified 109 novel PPIs among circadian clock proteins via a yeast-two-hybrid approach. Among them, the interaction of protein phosphatase 1 and CLOCK/BMAL 1 was found to result in BMAL 1 destabilization. We constructed a dynamic circadian PPI network predicting the PPI timing using circadian expression data. Systematic circadian phenotyping (RNAi and overexpression) suggests a crucial role for components involved in dynamic interactions. Systems analysis of a global dynamic network in liver revealed that interacting proteins are expressed at similar times likely to restrict regulatory interactions to specific phases. Moreover, we predict that circadian PPIs dynamically connect many important cellular processes (signa...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{quantitative}} experimental demonstration of solvent-mediated communication between noncontacting biopolymers. We show {{that changes in}} the activity of a solvent component brought about by a conformational change in one biopolymer can result in changes in the physical properties of a second noncontacting biopolymer present in solution. Specifically, we show that the release of protons on denaturation of a donor polymer (in this case, a four-stranded DNA tetraplex, iDNA) modulates the melting temperature of a noncontacting, acceptor polymer [in this case poly(A) ]. In addition to such proton-mediated cross talk, we also demonstrate counterion-mediated cross talk between noncontacting biopolymers. Specifically, we show that counterion association/release on denaturation of native salmon sperm DNA (the donor polymer) can modulate the melting temperature of poly(dA) ⋅poly(dT) (the acceptor polymer). Taken together, these two examples demonstrate how poly(A) and poly(dA) ⋅poly(dT) can serve as molecular probes that report the pH and free salt concentrations in solution, respectively. Further, we demonstrate how such through-solvent dialogue between biopolymers that do not directly interact {{can be used to}} evaluate (in a model-free manner) association/dissociation reactions of solvent components (e. g., protons, sodium cations) with one of the two biopolymers. We propose that such through-solution dialogue is a general property of all biopolymers. As a result, such solvent-mediated cross talk should be considered when assessing reactions of multicomponent systems such as those that exist in <b>essentially</b> all <b>biological</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Protein {{phosphorylation}} {{is involved}} in posttranslational control of <b>essentially</b> all <b>biological</b> <b>processes.</b> Using mass spectrometry, recent analyses of whole phosphoproteomes led to the identification of numerous new phosphorylation sites. However, the function of most of these sites remained unknown. We chose the Drosophila Bicaudal-D protein to estimate the importance of individual phosphorylation events. Being involved in different cellular processes, BicD is required for oocyte determination, for RNA transport during oogenesis and embryogenesis, and for photoreceptor nuclei migration in the developing eye. The numerous roles of BicD and the available evidence for functional importance of BicD phosphorylation led us to identify eight phosphorylation sites of BicD, and we tested a total of 14 identified and suspected phosphoserine residues for their functional importance in vivo in flies. Surprisingly, all these serines {{turned out to be}} dispensable for providing sufficient basal BicD activity for normal growth and development. However, in a genetically sensitized background where the BicD(A 40 V) protein variant provides only partial activity, serine 103 substitutions are not neutral anymore, but show surprising differences. The S 103 D substitution completely inactivates the protein, whereas S 103 A behaves neutral, and the S 103 F substitution, isolated in a genetic screen, restores BicD(A 40 V) function. Our results suggest that many BicD phosphorylation events may either be fortuitous or play a modulating function as shown for Ser(103). Remarkably, amongst the Drosophila serines we found phosphorylated, Ser(103) {{is the only one that}} is fully conserved in mammalian BicD...|$|R
40|$|Filamentous fungi occupy {{critical}} environmental niches {{and have}} numerous beneficial industrial applications but devastating effects as pathogens and agents of food spoilage. As regulators of <b>essentially</b> all <b>biological</b> <b>processes</b> protein kinases have been intensively studied but how they regulate the often unique biology of filamentous fungi {{is not completely}} understood. Significant understanding of filamentous fungal biology {{has come from the}} study of the model organism Aspergillus nidulans using a combination of molecular genetics, biochemistry, cell biology and genomic approaches. Here we describe dual localization-affinity purification (DLAP) tags enabling endogenous N or C-terminal protein tagging for localization and biochemical studies in A. nidulans. To establish DLAP tag utility we endogenously tagged 17 protein kinases for analysis by live cell imaging and affinity purification. Proteomic analysis of purifications by mass spectrometry confirmed association of the CotA and NimXCdk 1 kinases with known binding partners and verified a predicted interaction of the SldABub 1 /R 1 spindle assembly checkpoint kinase with SldBBub 3. We demonstrate that the single TOR kinase of A. nidulans locates to vacuoles and vesicles, suggesting that the function of endomembranes as major TOR cellular hubs is conserved in filamentous fungi. Comparative analysis revealed 7 kinases with mitotic specific locations including An-Cdc 7 which unexpectedly located to mitotic spindle pole bodies (SPBs), the first such localization described for this family of DNA replication kinases.

40|$|Biochar {{has been}} widely {{proposed}} as a soil amendment, with reports of benefits to soil physical, chemical and biological properties. To quantify the changes in soil microbial biomass and to understand the mechanisms involved, two biochars were prepared at 350 °C (BC 350) and 700 °C (BC 700) from Miscanthus giganteus, a C 4 plant, naturally enriched with 13 C. The biochars were added to soils of about pH 4 and 8, which were both sampled from a soil pH gradient of the same soil type. Isotopic (13 C) techniques were used to investigate biochar C availability to the biomass. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used to observe the microbial colonization, and Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) to highlight structural changes at {{the surface of the}} biochars. After 90 days incubation, BC 350 significantly increased the biomass C concentration relative to the controls in both the low (p < 0. 05) and high pH soil (p < 0. 01). It declined between day 90 and 180. The same trend occurred with soil microbial ATP. Overall, biomass C and ATP concentrations were closely correlated over all treatments (R 2 = 0. 87). This indicates that neither the biomass C, nor ATP analyses were affected by the biochars, unless, of course, they were both affected in the same way, which is highly unlikely. About 20 % of microbial biomass 13 C was derived from BC 350 after 90 days of incubation in both low and high pH soils. However, less than 2 % of biomass 13 C was derived from BC 700 in the high pH soil, showing very low biological availability of BC 700. After 90 days of incubation, microbial colonization in the charsphere (defined here as the interface between soil and biochar) was more pronounced with the BC 350 in the low pH soil. This was consistent with the biomass C and ATP results. The microbial colonization following biochar addition in our study was mainly attributed to biochar C availability and its large surface area. There was a close linear relationship between 13 CO 2 evolved and biomass 13 C, suggesting that biochar mineralization is <b>essentially</b> a <b>biological</b> <b>process.</b> The interactions between non-living and living organic C forms, which are vital in terms of soil fertility and the global C cycle, may be favoured in the charsphere, which has unique properties, distinct from both the internal biochar and the bulk soil. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
