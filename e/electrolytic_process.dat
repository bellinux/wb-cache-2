25|$|In 1800, English chemists William Nicholson and Johann Wilhelm Ritter {{succeeded in}} {{separating}} water into {{hydrogen and oxygen}} by electrolysis. Soon thereafter, Ritter discovered the process of electroplating. He also observed {{that the amount of}} metal deposited and the amount of oxygen produced during an <b>electrolytic</b> <b>process</b> depended on the distance between the electrodes. By 1801 Ritter had observed thermoelectric currents, which anticipated the discovery of thermoelectricity by Thomas Johann Seebeck.|$|E

50|$|The term, '{{refining}}' {{can also}} refer to certain <b>electrolytic</b> <b>processes.</b> Accordingly, {{some kinds of}} pyrometallurgical refining {{are referred to as}} 'fire refining'.|$|R
25|$|Electro{{chemicals}} are {{chemicals and}} metals produced by an <b>electrolytic</b> <b>process.</b> Important examples include aluminum {{made by the}} Hall–Héroult process and chlorine and caustic (sodium and potassium compounds). Chlorine and caustic had been produced by chemical processes but producing aluminum this way was prohibitively expensive. A large plant using Hall–Héroult process was opened in Pittsburgh, USA in 1888 and others opened around the world. Falling electricity prices in the early 20th century greatly lowered the cost of making electrochemicals. There was high demand for aluminum for aircraft during World War I and afterward for commercial aviation.|$|E
25|$|Water can be {{converted}} to its component elemental gasses, H2 and O2 through the application of an external voltage. Water doesn't decompose into hydrogen and oxygen spontaneously as the Gibbs free energy for the process at standard conditions is about 474.4 kJ. The decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen can be performed in an electrolytic cell. In it, a pair of inert electrodes usually made of platinum immersed in water act as anode and cathode in the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>process.</b> The electrolysis starts with the application of an external voltage between the electrodes. This process will not occur except at extremely high voltages without an electrolyte such as sodium chloride or sulfuric acid (most used 0.1 M).|$|E
25|$|Invented by Emil Wohlwill in 1874, this {{produces}} the highest purity gold (99.999%). It is an <b>electrolytic</b> <b>process</b> using pure gold for the cathode (or titanium {{as a starter}} cathode) and chloroauric acid (gold chloride-hydrochloric acid) as the electrolyte; this is made by dissolving gold with chlorine gas {{in the presence of}} hydrochloric acid. Gold is dissolved at the anode, and pure gold, traveling through the acid by ion transfer, is plated onto the cathode. Silver forms an insoluble chloride slime and copper and platinum form soluble chlorides that are removed. This procedure is used on a very large industrial scale and has a large set up cost due to the amount of gold that needs to be permanently dissolved in the electrolyte.|$|E

25|$|In 1898, Fritz Haber {{showed that}} {{definite}} reduction products {{can result from}} <b>electrolytic</b> <b>processes</b> if the potential at the cathode is kept constant. In 1898, he explained the reduction of nitrobenzene in stages at the cathode and this became the model for other similar reduction processes.|$|R

2500|$|Charles Martin Hall was a {{graduate}} of Oberlin College in Ohio who had discovered in February 1886 an <b>electrolytic</b> <b>process</b> for aluminum extraction. His patent application in July collided with Paul Héroult's application for the same idea, [...] "electrolysis of alumina in cryolite" [...] and for which Héroult had received the patent in France in April. Hall proved his February date and was awarded the patent in the U.S. Hall made a licensing agreement and worked with the Cowles at the facility in Lockport with the hopes of moving his ideas from the laboratory into production.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{effects of}} applied voltage on the {{magnetic}} and mechanical properties of polyol electrodeposited NiCo films were studied and reported. Both electroless and <b>electrolytic</b> <b>processes</b> competed {{with each other}} during deposition. There existed a clear influence of voltage on the composition and magnetic properties of deposited films. However, a simple, systematic correlation of these properties with the structure, composition and microstructure could not be made. This lack of correlation was attributed to the complex variation of deposition chemistry with deposition time and voltage. It is conceivable that thick films deposited using long reaction time may have through-thickness inhomogeneity, thus obscuring the correlation of properties with the volume-averaged film characteristics...|$|R

40|$|Two {{areas of}} {{corrosion}} occur in pipe lines: corrosion from the medium carried inside the pipes; corrosion attack upon {{the outside of}} the pipes (underground corrosion. <b>Electrolytic</b> <b>processes</b> are also involved in underground corrosion. Here the moisture content of the soil acts as an electrolyte, and the ions required to conduct the current are supplied by water-soluble salts (chlorides, sulfates, etc.) present in the soil. The nature and amount of these soluble materials can vary within a wide range, which is seen from the varying electrical conductivity and pH (varies between 3 and 10). Therefore the characteristics of a soil will be an important factor in under-ground corrosion...|$|R
40|$|AbstractElectrochemical {{techniques}} {{are among the}} most commonly techniques used for the evaluation and study of corrosion in reinforced concrete, including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a powerful technique for characterizing a wide variety of electrochemical systems and for determining the contribution of electrode or <b>electrolytic</b> <b>processes</b> in these systems. The analysis of EIS results on samples of concrete is highly complex due to overlapping arcs from simultaneous phenomena and noise measurement, of course, associated with the heterogeneity of the samples and that complicate the analysis considerably. Thus, this paper proposes a new form of analysis based on the characteristic relaxation angular frequency, w, of each phenomenon and associating the typical capacitances and frequencies...|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two common}} {{processes}} for electrowinning the metal: the low current density process, and the Tainton high current density process. The former uses a 10% sulfuric acid solution as the electrolyte, with current density of 270-325 amperes per square meter. The latter uses 22-28% sulfuric acid solution as the electrolyte with a current density of about 1,000 amperes per square metre. The latter gives better purity and has higher production capacity per volume of electrolyte, {{but has the}} disadvantage of running hotter and being more corrosive to the vessel {{in which it is}} done. In either of the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>processes,</b> each metric ton of zinc production expends about [...] of electric power.|$|R
