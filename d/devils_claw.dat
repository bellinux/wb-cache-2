40|$|An {{important}} {{stage in}} tissue {{culture is the}} acclimatising of the in vitro grown plantlets to conditions outside the culture flask. Many plantlets succumb to fungal attack at this stage resulting in significant financial loss. The use of plant extracts as possible antifungal agents is of great interest in this regard. In a pilot study aqueous extracts of Tulbaghia violacea and Allium sativum (Alliaceae) were used to treat plantlets of Harpagophytum procumbens (<b>devils</b> <b>claw)</b> by pre-soaking plantlets in extract before planting out into pots or by applying extracts as a soil drench after planting plantlets into pots. Results obtained after a two-week period showed that plantlets treated with extracts of T. violacea had a higher percentage survival than did those treated with extracts of A. sativum. Applying T. violacea extract as a soil drench was most effective at increasing plantlet survival. In an in vitro assay for antifungal activity, extracts of T. violacea had greater activity than A. sativum against the fungal pathogens: Botrytis cinerea, Pythium ultimum and Rhizoctonia solani. This activity was lower than that obtained for the commercial fungicide used when compared on a concentration basis. Results suggest that aqueous extracts of T. violacea {{may be used as}} an alternative to synthetic fungicides to increase plantlet survival of H. procumbens during acclimatisation...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} evaluates {{the effect of}} {{isolated}} fractions of Harpagophytum procumbens (devil`s claw) on cyclooxygenase (COX- 1 and COX- 2) activities and NO production using a whole blood assay. The activity of COX- 1 was quantified as platelet thromboxane B(2) production in blood clotting and COX- 2 as prostaglandin E(2) production in LPS-stimulated whole blood. Total NO(2) (-) /NO(3) (-) concentration was determined by Griess reaction in LPS stimulated blood. Assays were performed by incubation of isolated fractions obtained by flash chromatography monitored with HPLC, TLC and identified by (1) HNMR, containing different amounts of harpagoside with blood from healthy donors. Indomethacin and etoricoxib were the positive controls of COX- 1 and COX- 2 Inhibition. Data shows that fraction containing the highest concentration of harpagoside inhibited indistinctively COX- 1 and COX- 2 (37. 2 and 29. 5 % respectively) activity and greatly inhibited NO production (66 %). In contrast the fraction including iridoid pool increased COX- 2 and did not alter NO and COX- 1 activities. The fraction containing cinnamic acid was able to reduce only NO production (67 %). Our results demonstrated that the harpagoside fraction is the main responsible for the effect of <b>devils</b> <b>claw</b> on these enzyme activities. However, other components from devil`s claw crude extract could antagonize or increase the synthesis of inflammatory mediators. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. FAPESP[04 / 02452 - 7...|$|E

40|$|<b>Devil’s</b> <b>Claw</b> (Harpagophytum procumbens) a plant {{native to}} Southern Africa, has {{historically}} been used in traditional medicine to treat {{a wide range of}} diseases and currently is widely employed as antiinflammatory and pain-relieving natural remedy in Europe {{and other parts of the}} world. Aim of the study: Little is known about possible herb-drug interactions arising from effects of <b>Devil’s</b> <b>Claw</b> on the major drug metabolizing enzymes or transporters. This study evaluated in vitro the effects of <b>Devil’s</b> <b>Claw</b> on the multidrug transporter ABCB 1 /P-glycoprotein. Materials and methods: The effects of three commercially available <b>Devil’s</b> <b>Claw</b> preparations and that of pure harpagoside were studied in the human kidney (HK- 2) proximal tubule cell line, constitutively expressing ABCB 1 /P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Pgp activity and expression were tested by the calcein-AM test and by Western blotting, respectively. Results: Commercial preparations inhibited P-gp activity, even if to a different extent, while pure harpagoside was almost ineffective. In cells cultured for three days in the presence of <b>Devil’s</b> <b>Claw</b> preparations or pure harpagoside, a dose-dependent P-gp upregulation was found. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate for the first time that <b>Devil’s</b> <b>Claw</b> may interact with the multidrug transporter ABCB 1 /P-gp, the effect not appearing strictly related to the harpagoside relative content. Modulation of both P-gp activity and P-gp expression by <b>Devil’s</b> <b>Claw</b> raise the possibility of herb-drug interactions, to be further explored in depth...|$|R

40|$|The {{market for}} underutilised crops Patrick Van Damme and Koublan Edmond Koffi Suggested {{introduction}} Take {{a look at}} the international market and you will see that several of the world?s neglected or underutilised crops are making a comeback. Whether for their leaves, fruits, tubers or roots, we are rediscovering niche markets for these long-forgotten plants, and farmers are making money from supplying the demand. Some are sold fresh. Others are processed into nutritious foods while others are used for their medicinal properties, that ease some of the symptoms of the problem diseases of our time. So how can we know what the market wants? Rose Reuben met two marketing specialists from two parts of the world. Professor Patrick Van Damme is based in Belgium and Koublan Edmond Koffi works in Cote d?Ivoire. Rose began by asking them both for examples of new markets for old crops. Track 10 In	?There are a lot of plants ? Out	? will be much more diversified. ? Duration	 4 ? 35 ? Suggested closing announcement: Professor Patrick Van Damme and Koublan Edmond Koffi were discussing the market prospects for some of Africa?s neglected crops with Rose Reuben.

Some of them have also made it into a real crop status because they are grown, but that is only a few. Reuben	What about in Cote D?Ivoire? Koffi	In Cote D?Ivoire let?s say you can divide the crop species into two kinds. We have leafy vegetables that are annual crops and we have also perennial crops that are mainly used for fruits and the leaves. And on this point let?s say that all of the tree crops are most of the time in the landscape, they are not cultivated, they are not domesticated but product obtained from these trees are subject of trade in the country and out of the country in the sub region of West Africa. Reuben	Can you mention a few of the neglected plants or crops in Namibia? Damme	There is one important one, <b>Devil?s</b> <b>claw</b> it is called, for which there is a market in Germany amongst others. Now this is a plant that grows very slowly because {{we are talking about a}} desert kind of environment. It grows very slowly and they want to harvest the roots eventually, so that would kill the plant. So they are harvesting those from the wild. There is this idea that this plant should be grown but when you start growing it, it grows very slowly. So if you start the plantation now you will only reap the benefit in a few years time. So that takes a lot of time and people now, there is a market and they have jumped onto the opportunity and they are harvesting and maybe they are even over-harvesting it. Apart from that there are a few plants here and there that have maybe some medicinal properties and that would have a regional importance. Reuben	So do you think these crops and plants which are neglected, could they be coming back to the fashion? Koffi	Yes obviously there is a public awareness to our population and according to the high register of nutrient in these crops, people are now getting interested to these crop species and namely in leafy vegetables. We have a lot of leafy vegetables that in the past were used by our population and these leafy vegetables are used in many diets. Now the constraint is that the young people have not the habit of this diet and it is critical to introduce these neglected crops in the habit of the young people to maintain the use of these neglected crops. And to talk about the tree crops, the dry leaves also are sold on many markets and the fruits of the shea tree and the butter are also sold for food and for pharmaceutical industries. Reuben	Professor Van Damme, what are the challenges that you are meeting in promoting these neglected crops and plants? Damme	The international agricultural research has always promoted species and varieties therein of just a limited number of crops and so people have grown accustomed to that fact and now what you find on your platter is a very limited number of species that are actually used. There is also private sector interest but sometimes the policy environment is not an enabling one. Koffi	One of the main challenges is public awareness because many scientific results show that these crops are very, very rich in vitamins and minerals and micronutrients and these results are not known by population. So they have to be aware of that. And the second step, most of the time research activities are not reported to the world?s people and they do not know what is going on in research. And the third step is towards politicians. As I said, policy decision makers have to be involved in the process of putting forward this information. Damme	Also you should know that I think the resilience of a system depends on having a number of different crops, a number of different activities. Hopefully by 2020, 2030, the kind of diet we will live on will be much broader, will be much more diversified. End of track. <b>Devil?s</b> <b>Claw</b> is a desert growing plant that is now in demand for the medicinal properties of its roots. Traditionally used by people in Namibia, demand in Europe is leading to over-harvesting, not least because the plant is very slow growing, making the establishment of commercial production very difficult. Meanwhile, the market for leafy vegetables in Cote D?Ivoire ? and other parts of Africa ? is limited, because they have not yet become popular with young people...|$|E

Raman mappings of root samples and tablets reveal {{spatial distribution of}} this valuable iridoid glycoside within samples. Spectral data and reference HPLC values of harpagoside demonstrate a possibility for developing a multivariate calibration based model of useful prediction ability. <b>Devil's</b> <b>claw</b> (Harpagophytum procumbens, Pedaliaceae), also known as "grapple plant " because of its claw-like dried seedpods, is a herb from the Kalahari desert region of south western Africa.

Recent research in Europe has shown that it reduces inflammation and pain in rheumatic conditions and can stimulate appetite. <b>Devil's</b> <b>claw</b> contains iridoid glycosides, such as harpagoside, which are believed to have strong anti- inflammatory effects [3, 4]. Harpagoside is highly concentrated in the secondary roots of the plant. Usually ground <b>devil's</b> <b>claw</b> roots are processed into capsules, tablets, liquid extracts, and topical ointments, but teas (infusions) are also prepared from dried <b>devil's</b> <b>claw</b> root.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is {{a highly}} {{prevalent}} musculoskeletal disorder. Conventional treatment (i. e., the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs-NSAIDs) is associated with well-documented adverse effects. <b>Devil's</b> <b>Claw</b> (Harpagophytum procumbens) a traditional South African herbal remedy used for rheumatic conditions, may be a safer treatment option. To date, 14 clinical trials have assessed its efficacy/ effectiveness in OA. AIM: To address the two main questions of importance to clinicians: (1) Does <b>Devil's</b> <b>Claw</b> work {{for the treatment of}} OA, and (2) Is it safe? METHODS: A review of the literature on <b>Devil's</b> <b>Claw</b> and OA from 1966 to 2006 was performed using multiple search databases, monographs, and citation tracking. Relevant trials in all languages were identified and included. Both internal validity (i. e., adequacy of the dosage and period of treatment for this condition, reporting of randomization, rates of dropout, blinding, and statistical analysis) and external validity (i. e., inclusion/ exclusion criteria, baseline characteristics of the study populations, trial setting, and the appropriateness of the outcome measures of the trials) were assessed. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were identified: eight observational studies; 2 comparator trials (1 open, the other randomized to assess clinical effectiveness); and 4 double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trials to assess efficacy. Many of the published trials lacked certain important methodological quality criteria. However, the data from the higher quality studies suggest that <b>Devil's</b> <b>Claw</b> appeared effective in the reduction of the main clinical symptom of pain. The assessment of safety is limited by the small populations generally evaluated in the clinical studies. From the current data, <b>Devil's</b> <b>Claw</b> appears to be associated with minor risk (relative to NSAIDs), but further long-term assessment is required. CONCLUSIONS: The methodological quality of the existing clinical trials is generally poor, and although they provide some support, there are a considerable number of methodologic caveats that make further clinical investigations warranted. The clinical evidence to date cannot provide a definitive answer to the two questions posed: (1) Does it work? And (2) is it safe? A definitive high-quality trial that addresses the necessary methodologic improvements noted is needed to answer these important clinical questions...|$|R
