Irishman (and therefore British subject) Gerald Griffin, had been given a dictation test in Dutch, which he had failed as he was meant to do.

25|$|In {{what was}} the most financially {{successful}} UFC event up to that point, Liddell fought a rematch with Tito Ortiz at UFC 66, which took place on December 30, 2006. Liddell's takedown defense neutralized Ortiz's wrestling ability forcing Ortiz to stand up with a known striker. Although Ortiz did take Liddell down {{at one point in the}} fight, Liddell went on to defeat Ortiz via TKO in the third round to successfully defend his light heavyweight championship for a fourth time. It was later revealed that Liddell tore his MCL prior to the fight. In addition, during the fight <b>he</b> <b>popped</b> the tendon out on the middle finger on his left hand.|$|E
25|$|At the 2017 World Team Trophy Hanyu came {{in seventh}} {{place in the}} men's short program. <b>He</b> <b>popped</b> his quadruple loop to a single loop and did not receive any points for this jump. He also put his right hand on the ice during the quadruple Salchow {{and was unable to}} {{complete}} the combination, taking another sharp drop in points. In his free skating Hanyu placed first after receiving 200.49 points for a routine that featured four quadruple jumps (with three {{in the second half of}} the program for the first time in history), including a quadruple toe loop-half loop-triple Salchow combination. Overall he added 18 points to the team score, to help Team Japan win gold.|$|E

25|$|The {{second day}} saw India make a heavy string of {{mistakes}} which cost them dearly. Coming in at 329/4, with Ganguly and Laxman both looking good for better scores, India began the day's play {{with much more}} confidence than their opponents. India did begin brightly, after Ganguly unfurled some glorious strokes against Nathan Bracken and Lee. However, in the 95th over bowled by Lee, which lasted 8 balls, courtesy of three no-balls from the bowler, Ganguly's weakness against fast-bowlers resurfaced as <b>he</b> <b>popped</b> a short-of-length ball to gully after knocking Lee for two fours, becoming the fifth wicket to fall, for 350. Thereafter, India completely lost their way. Poor judgment from the lower-order batsmen and Laxman's dismissal for 19 contributed to India's spectacular demise, as the last 6 wickets fell for 16 runs.|$|E
25|$|At the 2017 Four Continents Championships, Hanyu placed {{third in}} the short program with a score of 97.04 points. <b>He</b> <b>popped</b> his quadruple Salchow-triple toe loop {{combination}} to a double Salchow-triple toe loop combination. Despite this, the Olympic champion was only 6 points behind Nathan Chen (in first) and less than 3.5 points behind Shoma Uno (in second). During his free skating, he started strong with a quadruple loop and a quadruple Salchow, followed by a triple flip, but then popped his second quadruple Salchow-triple toe loop combination attempt to a double Salchow. To {{make up for lost}} points, Hanyu, in place of the planned triple Axel-double toe loop combination, performed a triple Axel-triple toe loop combination and also substituted the triple Axel-half loop-triple Salchow combination with a quadruple toe loop-double toe loop combination. The reigning Olympic champion also changed his final jumping pass from a triple Lutz to a triple Axel. In the free skating, he pulled up to first with a score of 206.67, but overall finished second behind Nathan Chen, by less than 4 points, and over bronze medalist Shoma Uno, by more than 15.|$|E
500|$|Tina Charles of TV Guide {{was happy}} to see the [...] "appropriately creepy" [...] Lehne return to the role in [...] "All Hell Breaks Loose". [...] "The second <b>he</b> <b>popped</b> in at ghost town central ... the scare factor went up", she wrote. Likewise, Tom Burns of UGO deemed all of Lehne's scenes [...] "damn near riveting", while Brett Love of TV Squad {{described}} him as [...] "a perfect evil menace". Diana Steenbergen of IGN deemed Lehne's performance [...] "charismatic and quietly sadistic without being overdone". Despite this praise, she {{was happy to}} see the character die because [...] "it frees the show from bogging down by having the Winchesters chasing after the same villain endlessly" [...] and [...] "opens up the opportunity to explore new plots".|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} in 2003, Schachte {{made no mention of}} being on the skimmer with Kerry that night; in addition, he described the action as a [...] "firefight" [...] and said of Kerry, [...] "He got hit." [...] In August 2004, however, Schachte stated that he was the senior officer on Kerry's skimmer that night, with one enlisted man also on board, that <b>he</b> <b>popped</b> a flare after detecting movement, and opened fire. [...] He stated that there was no return fire, and that Kerry was [...] "nicked" [...] by a fragment from an M-79 grenade launcher he fired himself. Moreover, while Schachte has described Kerry as, at the time, a [...] "rookie [...] would never be put in command" [...] of a skimmer mission, Kerry was actually given command of a Swift Boat and crew just three days after the skimmer mission and sent into a combat area.|$|E

[...] Risner's aircraft was at very low altitude flying at approximately 600mph, approaching a site that was likely a decoy luring aircraft into a concentration of AAA. Heavy ground fire struck Risner's F-105 in its air intakes when <b>he</b> <b>popped</b> up over a hill to make his attack. Again he attempted to fly to the Gulf of Tonkin, but ejected when the aircraft, on fire, pitched up out of control.

[...] He saw some people who he thought were insanely brilliant individuals who seemed to have the same mindset and positive attitude towards hacking that he did so he decided to approach a couple of them to see if anyone would be interested in forming a group and working together. [...] There was always a huge emphasis not only on technical competence and variety, but also on strength of character and integrity. [...] The team was a mix of hackers, programmers, phone phreakers, security professionals, and artists. [...] They had experience in multiple programming languages and operating systems. [...] DDP members are not only good programmers and hackers, but more importantly, good people. [...] By 1999 the DDP had its first official members and from this partnership, creativity flowed.|$|E

2500|$|Arriving at the University of Cambridge in January 1828, Darwin found [...] this elite {{theological}} {{training institution}} governed by complex rules much more congenial than his experiences at Edinburgh. No rooms were available at Christ's College, {{so he took}} lodgings above a tobacconists in Sidney Street, across the road. [...] Extramural activities were important, and while Darwin did not take up sports or debating, his interests included music and his main passion was the current national craze for the (competitive) collecting of beetles. Trainee clergymen scoured Cambridgeshire for specimens, referring to An Introduction to Entomology by William Kirby and William Spence. Charles joined his older cousin William Darwin Fox who was already a skilled collector and like him got a small dog. The two and their dogs became inseparable. [...] They explored the countryside as Darwin learnt about natural history from his cousin. Darwin became obsessed with winning the student accolade and collected avidly. Once he stripped bark from a dead tree and caught a ground beetle in each hand, then saw the rare Crucifix Ground Beetle, [...] Panagaeus cruxmajor. With the habits of an egg-collector, <b>he</b> <b>popped</b> one ground beetle in his mouth to free his hand, but it ejected some intensely acrid fluid which burnt his tongue and Darwin was forced to spit it out. He lost all three. The specimens he did not lose had to be mounted and identified, and his knowledge from Edinburgh of Lamarck proved useful. Fox introduced him for advice on identification to the Revd. John Stevens Henslow, professor of botany, and Darwin began attending his soirées, a club for budding naturalists. Here he could meet other professors including the geologist the Revd. Adam Sedgwick and the new mineralogist the Revd. William Whewell.|$|E
