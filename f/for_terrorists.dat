25|$|On 6 April—in {{advent of}} {{the arrival of the}} United States {{delegation}} aboard Air Force One, protected by a military escort—the Italian government issued a no-fly zone within a five-mile radius of Rome.

25|$|In 2005 the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization (ANSTO) {{complained about}} the {{potential}} <b>for</b> <b>terrorists</b> to use the satellite images in planning attacks, with specific reference to the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor; however, the Australian Federal government {{did not support the}} organization's concern.

25|$|On April 27, two teenagers, aged 15 (though {{other sources}} cite their ages as 12 and 13), were arrested at a {{checkpoint}} near Jenin after 11 explosive charges {{were found on}} them. One teenager was recruited by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the other by the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades. The two told interrogators {{that they had been}} acting as couriers <b>for</b> <b>terrorists,</b> but security forces suspect they planned to get close to the soldiers and then detonate the charges.|$|E

25|$|In {{my career}} when I prosecute {{the worst of}} the worst like people who kill children, I believe the only {{appropriate}} punishment is the death penalty. Tom Brinkman is against the death penalty even for those vicious killers who prey on our kids, and he's even against the death penalty <b>for</b> <b>terrorists</b> who kill Americans. Our next congressman must go to Washington and fight to remove these murderers from society. Tom Brinkman will work to stop the death penalty just as he's done in Columbus. Pat DeWine believes these people should go. And that's one more reason I support Pat DeWine for Congress.|$|E
25|$|The USA PATRIOT Act was reauthorized {{by three}} bills. The first, the USA PATRIOT and Terrorism Prevention Reauthorization Act of 2005, {{was passed by}} both houses of Congress in July 2005. This bill reauthorized {{provisions}} of the USA PATRIOT Act and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. It created new provisions relating {{to the death penalty}} <b>for</b> <b>terrorists,</b> enhancing security at seaports, new measures to combat the financing of terrorism, new powers for the Secret Service, anti-methamphetamine initiatives {{and a number of other}} miscellaneous provisions. The second reauthorization act, the USA PATRIOT Act Additional Reauthorizing Amendments Act of 2006, amended the first and was passed in February 2006.|$|E

25|$|The Docklands' {{status as}} a symbol of Margaret Thatcher's Britain has also made it a target <b>for</b> <b>terrorists.</b> After a failed attempt to bomb Canary Wharf in 1992, a large IRA bomb {{exploded}} at South Quay on 9 February 1996. Two people died in the explosion, forty people were injured and an estimated £150 million of damage was caused. This bombing ended an IRA ceasefire. In a 1998 trial James McArdle was imprisoned for 25 years after a trial at Woolwich Crown Court that ended on 24 June. Under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement and royal prerogative of mercy officially signed by Queen Elizabeth II, McArdle was released on 28 June 2000.|$|E
25|$|Significant {{conclusions}} of the report include the main objective, that American foreign policy and homeland security policies must adapt to better {{stem the tide of}} U.S. citizens traveling to and from distant battlefields. The report identifies police officials from the non-federal level who have cited their own personal worries about lack of resources in the form of security clearances in order to help the federal government deal with counterterrorism. The report identifies weak spots along the chain of foreign travel where terrorists are able to slip out of counterterrorism oversight capabilities. The authors of the work describe holes in law enforcement checkpoints both within the United States and more significantly in European countries were it is increasingly not difficult <b>for</b> <b>terrorists</b> to travel {{back and forth to the}} Western world.|$|E
25|$|Thomas G. Plaskett, {{a former}} American Airlines and Continental executive, {{replaced}} Acker as president in January 1988 (joining Pan Am from the latter). While {{a program to}} refurbish Pan Am aircraft and improve the company's on-time performance began showing positive results (in fact, Pan Am's most profitable quarter ever was {{the third quarter of}} 1988), on December 21, 1988, the terrorist bombing of Pan Am flight 103 by Abdelbaset al-Megrahi above Lockerbie, Scotland, resulted in 270 fatalities. Pan Am's iconic image had made it a repeated target <b>for</b> <b>terrorists,</b> resulting in many travelers avoiding the airline as they had begun to associate it with danger. Faced with a $300million lawsuit filed by more than 100 families of the Pan Am flight 103 victims, the airline subpoenaed records of six U.S. government agencies, including the CIA, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the State Department. Though the records suggested that the U.S. government was aware of warnings of a bombing and failed to pass the information to the airline, the families claimed Pan Am was attempting to shift the blame.|$|E

25|$|The Conservatives {{had so far}} {{failed to}} {{represent}} a serious challenge to Labour's rule, with John Major's successor William Hague unable to make any real improvement upon the disastrous 1997 general election result at the next election four years later. He stepped down after the 2001 election to be succeeded by Iain Duncan Smith, who did not even hold the leadership long enough to contest a general election – being ousted by his own MP's in October 2003 and being replaced by Michael Howard, who had served as Home Secretary {{in the government of}} John Major. Howard failed to win the 2005 general election for the Conservatives but he at least had the satisfaction of narrowing the Labour majority, giving his successor (he announced his resignation shortly after the election) a decent platform to build upon. However, the Conservatives began to re-emerge as an electable prospect following the election of David Cameron as Howard's successor in December 2005. Within months of Cameron becoming Conservative leader, opinion polls during 2006 were showing a regular Conservative lead {{for the first time since}} Black Wednesday 14 years earlier. Despite the economy still being strong and unemployment remaining low, Labour's decline in support was largely blamed upon poor control of immigration and allowing Britain to become what was seen by many as an easy target <b>for</b> <b>terrorists.</b>|$|E
500|$|Some {{opposition}} from neighborhood residents originated from concerns with increased congestion. Donald Trump immediately voiced {{opposition to the}} building, stating that the tall structure would be a target <b>for</b> <b>terrorists</b> and did not even {{seem to be a}} viable project. [...] The opposing comment by Trump was made while he himself was developing a supertall tower in Chicago, the Trump International Hotel and Tower. Trump's tower completed construction in January 2009, just a few blocks west of the Chicago Spire site. If the Chicago Spire had been built as planned, it would have replaced the Trump International Hotel and Tower as the tallest residential structure in the United States, and the two towers would have been in direct competition in selling residential units.|$|E
500|$|Running in {{parallel}} to the Marines' criminal trial were legal proceedings relating to the anonymity of the defendants. In the autumn of 2012, Judges Advocate Elsom and Blackett issued anonymity orders for the Marine defendants due to the risk that, once named, the defendants would become targets <b>for</b> <b>terrorists.</b> The move had been opposed by elements of the UK media. A lawyer for the Press Association argued that anonymity orders should not be issued in this case because, firstly, British military award recipients named in the media had not been previously targeted; and, secondly, that {{the names of those}} British service personnel investigated following the death of Baha Mousa had not been similarly protected. The 2012 anonymity orders were upheld {{at the beginning of the}} trial in October 2013.|$|E
