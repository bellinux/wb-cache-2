The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{utilisation}} and application of reflexive ethnography as an interpretative methodology for researching knowledge practices within <b>festival</b> <b>organisations.</b> Design/methodology/approach ??? The ethnographic approach incorporates two methods of data collection in the research design; participant observation and in-depth interviews. Findings ??? The research identified that knowledge management practices and processes are often invisible to festival staff when they are embeddedwithin a cohesive organisational culture. Ethnography enables the researcher to make explicit the tacit and normalised ways of working that contribute to the success (and failure) of <b>festival</b> <b>organisations</b> to manage knowledge. The immersion of the researcher in the ethnographic process provided a rich understanding of the relational dimension of knowledge management that would be difficult to elicit from in-depth interviews alone. Research limitations/implications ??? New fields of study require a range of research methodologies to inform theoretical and practice-based knowledge related to event participation and management. This article contributes to the growing event management literature through a unique focus on ethnography as a research method that offers a deeper understanding of knowledge practices within <b>festival</b> <b>organisations.</b> Originality/value ??? Limited research has applied an ethnographic approach to festival and event management.
