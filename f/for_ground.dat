Overall, I Corps fielded about 134,000 soldiers; 84,000 were regular soldiers and 50,000 belonged to the Regional and Popular Forces. Those forces were equipped with 449 tanks and armored vehicles, 418 artillery pieces, 64 M-42 Duster light air-defense weapons, 373 aircraft of different types, and 165 naval vessels of different sizes.|$|E

Following this exercise, the new C-130 aircrew are posted to No.37 Squadron.
