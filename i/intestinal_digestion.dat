5000|$|Enteropeptidase (also called enterokinase) is {{an enzyme}} {{produced}} by {{cells of the}} duodenum and involved in human and animal digestion. It is secreted from intestinal glands (the crypts of Lieberkühn) following the entry of ingested food passing from the stomach. Enteropeptidase converts trypsinogen (a zymogen) into its active form trypsin, resulting in the subsequent activation of pancreatic digestive enzymes.

5000|$|When {{present in}} foods and {{beverages}} that are ingested by humans, isomaltulose is essentially completely digested and absorbed. [...] Its <b>intestinal</b> <b>digestion</b> involves the enzyme isomaltase, {{which is located}} in the wall of the small intestine. This enzyme is otherwise involved in the digestion of α-1,6 linkages present in starch. The products of isomaltulose digestion are glucose and fructose, which enter blood. Once absorbed, the glucose and fructose follow the same metabolic routes through the body as if they were derived from sucrose. While fructose is converted to glucose in the liver, glucose from the small intestine and liver is distributed via blood to different parts of the body where it serves cellular metabolism as an energy source.|$|E

Duodenally and ileally cannulated steers were used in 5 studies to measure responses in small <b>intestinal</b> starch <b>digestion</b> to amino acids (AA) or casein. Flows of starch to the ileum from the diet were small. Small intestinal starch digestibility was 34. 0 % when raw cornstarch was continuously infused into the duodenum.

In another study, 5 steers were fed a low-starch diet and provided continuous duodenal infusion of raw cornstarch in combination with AA or casein {{in order to measure}} response of small <b>intestinal</b> starch <b>digestion.</b> Duodenal infusion of casein increased (P ≤ 0. 05) small <b>intestinal</b> starch <b>digestion.</b> When a mixture of AA with a profile similar to casein (CASAA) was infused, small <b>intestinal</b> starch <b>digestion</b> was similar (P = 0. 30) to casein infusion. Infusion of only non-essential AA tended to increase (P = 0. 14) small <b>intestinal</b> starch <b>digestion</b> relative to control; however, infusion of essential AA alone did not affect (P = 0. 84) small <b>intestinal</b> starch <b>digestion.</b> Additionally, infusion of casein or essential AA increased ileal flows of ethanol-soluble starch, but non-essential AA alone were not different than the negative control. Duodenal infusion of Glu increased (P ≤ 0. 05) small <b>intestinal</b> starch <b>digestion,</b> whereas a mixture of Phe, Trp, and Met (PTM) did not.

Ileostomy effluents from human volunteers fed meals containing the carrot material were used to study tissue microstructure and carotene release. Raw carrot shreds and intact cells that had survived the pureeing process were identifiable in Heal effluent. The gross tissue structure in the shreds had not changed following digestion. Carotene-containing particles remained encapsulated in intact cells, but were absent from ruptured cells. Microscopy revealed marked changes to the cell walls including swelling and pectin solubilization, which increased in severity with increasing residence time in the upper gut. These observations were entirely consistent with the in vitro observations. It was concluded that a single intact cell wall is sufficient to reduce carotene bioaccessibility from a cell by acting as a physical barrier, which is not broken down during upper gut digestion...|$|R

However, {{there is no consensus}} on their possible effects on infant nutrition, especially on mineral availability. The aim of the present work was to characterize the effect of LBG, cross-linked, hydroxypropylated maize starch (Mhdp) and pre-gelatinized rice starch (gRS) on Ca, Fe and Zn availability during a gastric and intestinal in vitro digestion assay in relation to their physicochemical properties in solution (apparent viscosity, solubility, molar mass (M) and conformational properties) through the simulated digestion process. LEG gave the highest decrease in Ca and Fe gastric (17. 96 % and 17. 6 % respectively) and intestinal (19. 5 % and 13. 5 %) solubility with respect to the reference without thickeners. Ca (11. 1 % +/- 1. 1), Fe (2. 77 % +/- 0. 3) and Zn (7. 78 % +/- 0. 6) dialyzability was also lower than for the reference (23. 4 % +/- 2. 9; 19. 65 % +/- 3. 53 and 27. 74 % +/- 33 respectively). LBG solubility remained stable during gastric digestion, decreasing significantly from a range of 65 - 69 % to 61. 1 % after <b>intestinal</b> <b>digestion.</b> LBG viscosity remained stable during the digestion process, being these findings attributable to its resistance to enzymes. On the other hand, the addition to Mhdp or gRS slightly affected Ca and Fe solubility or Ca dialyzability, decreasing after gastric digestion and then increasing after <b>intestinal</b> <b>digestion</b> with respect to the reference. These results correlated to the changes in their viscosity enhancing properties, which increased during gastric digestion and decreased after <b>intestinal</b> <b>digestion,</b> being attributable to their digestion by pancreatic enzymes. Gastric digestion resulted in an increase in M for the modified starches (more pronounced for gRS). The increase in mineral solubility and dialyzability after <b>intestinal</b> <b>digestion</b> with respect to the gastric stage was explained by the degradation of starches by intestinal enzymes, which resulted in a decrease in apparent shear viscosity (from 1. 2 to 1 Pa s, measured in a shear rate range 0. 00 - 50 s(- 1)) and an increase in solubility (from 3 to 6 % to approximately 70 %) after <b>intestinal</b> <b>digestion.</b> In conclusion, LBG could be more effective than Mhdp and gRS as thickener, providing higher viscosity and resistance to digestive process. However, its negative effect on mineral solubility and dialyzability should be taken into account.

First, an in vitro <b>intestinal</b> <b>digestion</b> model for phospholipids was developed. The impact of digestion in the antioxidant ability of PHT was also assayed. PHT was progressively hydrolyzed to lyso-PHT. However, digestion was {{slower than the}} phospholipid control. Nevertheless, most hydrolysis products were found at the micellar phase fraction, meaning a high bioaccessibility. Either PHT or digested PHT showed lower antioxidant activity than HT. However, PHT improved its antioxidant ability after digestion, likely related to lyso-PHT.

Accurate measurement of small <b>intestinal</b> <b>digestion</b> is crucial in dogs and cats because nutrient digestion and absorption occurs primarily in the small intestine. Measuring small intestinal digestibility requires access to digesta leaving the small intestine and can be obtained by placing a cannula at the terminal ileum. This approach also necessitates the use of markers (e. g. chromic oxide) to monitor flow of digesta. Specifically, this approach has been used for the direct measurement of <b>intestinal</b> <b>digestion</b> of carbohydrates and amino acids.

A comparative study on in vitro <b>intestinal</b> <b>digestion</b> of 2, 3 -dibutyroil- 1 -O-octadecyl glycerol (D-SCAKG) and tributyrin (TB), as potential pro-drugs of butyric acid, was performed. Aliquots were taken at different times of digestion for studying the extent and rate of hydrolysis of both substrates. The micellar phase (MP) and oily phase (OP) formed in the digestion media were separated and their composition in lipid products was analyzed. Initially, it was confirmed that the in vitro model reproduced physiological results by testing against olive oil as a standard lipid. The progress of in vitro <b>intestinal</b> <b>digestion</b> of D-SCAKG was slower than that of TB. TB hydrolyzed completely to butyric acid, whereas D-SCAKG mainly yielded 2 -butyroil- 1 -O-octadecyl glycerol (M-SCAKG), followed by butyric acid and 1 -O-octadecyl glycerol (AKG). The MP from both substrates mainly consisted of butyric acid. Minor levels of M-SCAKG and AKG were also found in the MP after hydrolysis of D-SCAKG, the M-SCAKG being mainly distributed in the OP. Therefore, D-SCAKG produced a stable form of esterified butyric acid as M-SCAKG after in vitro <b>intestinal</b> <b>digestion,</b> unlike TB.

40|$|The high {{contribution}} of postruminal starch digestion (up to 50 %) to total-tract starch digestion on energy-dense, starch-rich diets demands that limitations to small <b>intestinal</b> starch <b>digestion</b> be identified. A mechanistic {{model of the}} small intestine was described and evaluated with regard to its ability to simulate observations from abomasal carbohydrate infusions in the dairy cow. The 7 state variables represent starch, oligosaccharide, glucose, and pancreatic amylase in the intestinal lumen, oligosaccharide and glucose in the unstirred water layer at the intestinal wall, and intracellular glucose of the enterocyte. Enzymatic hydrolysis of starch was modeled as a 2 -stage process involving the activity of pancreatic amylase in the lumen and of oligosaccharidase at the brush border of the enterocyte confined within the unstirred water layer. The Na + -dependent glucose transport into the enterocyte was represented along with a facilitative glucose transporter 2 transport system on the basolateral membrane. The small intestine is subdivided into 3 main sections, representing the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum for parameterization. Further subsections are defined between which continual digesta flow is represented. The model predicted nonstructural carbohydrate disappearance in the small intestine for cattle unadapted to duodenal infusion with a coefficient of determination of 0. 92 and a root mean square prediction error of 25. 4 %. Simulation of glucose disappearance for mature Holstein heifers adapted to various levels of duodenal glucose infusion yielded a coefficient of determination of 0. 81 and a root mean square prediction error of 38. 6 %.

40|$|High-fat diets {{are often}} {{associated}} with greater caloric intake and weight gain. Since satiety during fat intake is induced by fat in the intestine we investigated the efficiency of a lipid compound that retards fat digestion to regulate fat intake. We found this compound to reduce high-fat food intake, body weight and blood lipids in Sprague-Dawley rats, without causing steatorrhea. The absence of steatorrhea is explained by an increased pancreatic lipase/colipase secretion, compensating the impaired lipolysis by the added compound. The animals also had an elevated CCK secretion. The satiety for fat may be the consequence of elevated CCK and procolipase/enterostatin levels. We conclude that compounds can be found that delay <b>intestinal</b> fat <b>digestion</b> and control high-fat food intake through the release of satiety signals, without causing steatorrhea.

We recall that this model aims at {{taking into account the}} three main phenomena of the diges-tion, namely the transit of the bolus, the degradation of feedstuffs and the absorption through the intestinal wall. In order to study the role of dietary fibre on digestion, we model their two principal physiochemical characteristics which interact with the function of the small intestine, i. e. viscosity and water holding capacity. This leads us to consider some features of digestion which have not been taken into account previously, in particular the interrelationship between the evolution of dry matter and water in the bolus. The numerical results are in agreement with the positive effect of insoluble dietary fibre on the velocity of bolus along the small intestine and on its degradation.

Gastric contents have been studied in patients with normal intestinal absorption and with malabsorption syndrome. In secondary steatorrhea there is a significantly increased incidence of gastric contamination by colon organisms, and this is usually associated with absence of free hydrochloric acid. It seems probable that such contamination interferes with <b>intestinal</b> <b>digestion</b> and absorption. The benefit resulting from the oral administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics to a group of patients with secondary steatorrhea supports this concept...|$|E
30|$|IGF- 1 {{is found}} {{as a crucial}} {{regulator}} to command developmental bone growth and energy metabolism (Sheng et al. 2014), and improve small intestine enzymes activity in broilers (Moosavinasab et al. 2015). EGF, as a polypeptide growth factor, has {{a close relationship with}} intestinal growth regarding promoting cell proliferation (Chan et al. 2015) and the restoration of damaged epithelium (Liu et al. 2016 a). Xu et al. (2015) demonstrated that EGF maintains the structural integrity and function of the small intestine in early-weaned piglets. In this data, the levels of IGF- 1 in jejunum and ileum and the level of EGF in jejunum in the SNE-infected chicks were notably lower than that of the negative group, implying the poor intestinal development in SNE chicks. Whereas BS 15 addition significantly enhanced the contents of IGF- 1 and EGF both in the jejunum and ileum {{on the basis of the}} infected chicks, suggesting the recovery from injury of intestinal segments. Besides that, the similar consequence that probiotics improve the <b>intestinal</b> <b>digestion</b> by raising the activities of various intestinal digestive enzymes (Vand et al. 2014; Shori 2015) was also proved in this present study, and showing that the poor growth of SNE broilers were improved by BS 15 through enhancing <b>intestinal</b> <b>digestion</b> ability, which was consistent with the previous result that FCR in BS 15 group was lower than that in SNE group.|$|E

40|$|Oral {{inoculation}} of suckling mice with reovirus serotype 1 (strain Lang) {{results in}} the conversion of intact virions to intermediate subviral particles (ISVPs) in the <b>intestinal</b> lumen. <b>Digestion</b> of virus in vitro with chymotrypsin or trypsin reveals two distinct forms of ISVPs, while the predominant species of ISVPs found in the small intestinal lumen appears to be identical to the chymotrypsin product. The in vivo conversion of virions to ISVPs was blocked by pretreatment of mice with protease inhibitors, resulting in inefficient replication of reovirus in intestinal tissue. The early inhibition of viral replication in suckling mice pretreated with protease inhibitors was not observed when suckling mice were inoculated with ISVPs generated by in vitro digestion with either chymotrypsin or trypsin. However, replication was decreased during secondary rounds of replication in mice receiving repeated doses of protease inhibitors, suggesting that luminal proteolytic digestion is important in rendering progeny virions infectious in the gut...|$|R
40|$|To {{improve the}} ability to predict amino acid flows in ruminants, which will enhance the {{efficiency}} of use of feed nitrogen (N), methods to better predict metabolizable protein (MP) and amino acid supply need to be developed. The objectives {{of this study were}} (1) to evaluate and improve the efficiency of precipitable true protein assay to understand the peptide profile that is chelated to better predict the supply of those components to support the MP supply of the cow; (2) to evaluate Streptomyces griseus assay as indicator for AA profile of MP supply; and (3) evaluate variation with published total digestion assays and make improvements to better estimate <b>intestinal</b> protein <b>digestion</b> of feeds for ruminants. Throughout, methods were evaluated or developed with commercial labs in mind so values could routinely be analyzed for use in the CNCPS. The efficiency of the precipitated true protein (PTP) assay was improved with tungstic acid (TA) or stabilized TA filtered on 1 or 6 [MICRO SIGN]m filters (P < 0. 05) but was time consuming as were ultrafiltration devices. Nonprotein N as assayed contains substantial quantities of amino acids and peptides. The Strep. griseus assay will predict rumen degradation of N but will not predict AA supply or digest carbohydrates and fiber. An in vitro (IV) assay to estimate <b>intestinal</b> protein <b>digestion</b> for ruminants was developed using an enzyme mix of trypsin, chymotrypsin, lipase and amylase at activities found in sheep digesta to replace pancreatin, reduced sample loss by eliminating the use of bags by employing Erlenmeyer flasks, utilized small pore size filter papers to further improve recoveries of undigested feed N and corrects for microbial contamination with corn silage ND. Acid detergent insoluble (ADI) N is digestible; thus, undigested N from the IV intestinal assay more accurately represents the protein C fraction than does ADIN given the more physiological conditions of rumen incubation and enzyme exposure. The IV assay provides a method, adoptable by commercial labs, to evaluate intestinal digestibility of ruminant feeds to better predict the MP and amino acid supply for input into the CNCPS. 2018 - 05 - 2...|$|R
