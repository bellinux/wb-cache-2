Fritz Mierau would later describe her as [...] "the soul and muse of the little circle". Pfemert edited a left-wing political and literary magazine called Die Aktion: Cläre Otto got to know his fellow contributors to Die Aktion, among them the restless anarchist poet Franz Jung whom she would later marry and under whose shadow, according to some evaluations, she would spend much of her life. However, her first marriage was to another Die Aktion contributor, the writer and political activist Richard Oehring: {{the two of them were}} divorced after two years, in 1917. By September 1918 she was living with Franz Jung, although it would be another ten years before the two of them got married.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed at}} Analyzing the Cost-Price Squeeze in Broiler Production Enterprises in Uyo Agricultural Zone of Akwa Ibom State. Specifically, the study aimed at {{comparing}} the trends in feed costs and broiler meat {{prices in the}} study area. The study relied on monthly secondary data from the Akwa Ibom State Agricultural Development Project, complemented with primary data from some long standing <b>feed</b> <b>merchants</b> from January 2000 to December 2011. Agricultural price indices (API) and Ordinary Least Square (OLS) trend estimation procedure were adopted as analytical tools in the study. On the average, cost of broiler feeds increased by 2 %, broiler meat increased by 1. 3 % per quarter. The index of prices received by broiler and index of cost paid out for feeds was consistently below 1 indicating the existence of cost-price squeeze in the broiler production enterprise. The result of the estimated regression parameters indicate a greater increase in broiler feed costs, relative to broiler meat prices. The research shows the existence of cost-price squeeze phenomenon in the broiler enterprise in the study area. The study recommends initiatives that would {{reduce the cost of}} poultry feed and/or boost the price of poultry products...|$|R
50|$|Comparison sites {{can also}} collect data through a data <b>feed</b> file. <b>Merchants</b> provide {{information}} electronically {{in a set}} format. This data is then imported by the comparison website. Some third party businesses are providing consolidation of data feeds so that comparison sites {{do not have to}} import from many different merchants. Affiliate networks such as LinkShare, Commission Junction or TradeDoubler aggregate data <b>feeds</b> from many <b>merchants</b> and provide them to the price comparison sites. Many of the popular shopping websites like Amazon and Flipkart provides direct affiliation to the customer who wants to become affiliate partner. They provides their own API to the affiliate partner to show their products with specifications to the affiliate partner's website. For example, Shoesdekho is one of their affiliate partner where you can find shoes price comparison from Flipkart, Amazon, Jabong, Snapdeal etc. This enables price comparison sites to monetize the products contained in the feeds by earning commissions on click through traffic. Other price comparison sites like PriceGrabber have deals with <b>merchants</b> and aggregate <b>feeds</b> using their own technology.|$|R

40|$|Before a shopper {{converts}} into a buyer {{there are}} a lot of steps to be taken. In each of these steps a portion of shoppers discontinues their purchase and the remaining part finalises the transaction. The conversion ratio is defined as the number of shoppers that finalise their transaction in com- parison to the number of shoppers that start a transaction, expressed as a percentage. Because Adyen handles the payments, it is an important part of the process. Chapter 1 states the main goal of the project as to gather information about the course of the payment sessions of consumers buying at on-line shops and explains why off the shelf solutions like Google Analytics are not feasible. In this chapter three sub-goals are defined. 1. Live data <b>feed</b> for <b>merchants.</b> 2. Data for marketing material. 3. Form a basis for an article. Next technologies that are currently in place are analysed. First the infrastructure of the Hosted Payment Pages (HPP) is discussed in Chapter 2 and how Skins can be used to customise the appearance of the HPP. Finally the difference in the payment flow between the Multi Page Payment (MPP) and One Page Payment (OPP) is explained as well as the information that is currently included in the log files. In Chapter 3 the problem is analysed and the main question for the project is defined as: ”How to measure and present the Conversion Ratio on the Hosted Payment Pages?” To answer this question the process is decomposed in five distinct steps. 1. Log the required data. 2. Make the logs machine readable. 3. Centralise the log information. 4. Store the data. 5. Visualise the data. This decomposition is applicable for a generic logging framework. As such, the individual steps, which are treated in subsequent chapters, start with a generic part and end with a project specific part. In Chapter 4 the flow of events within a payment session is analysed. With this information additional data to be logged, like the IP address of the shopper, is determined to produce rich statistics. Finally the validation of payment sessions through state machines is discussed. Chapter 5 discusses various logging formats ranging from CSV files to directly logging to a database. These formats are compared as how useful they are when read by a machine to detect interesting patterns as well as how readable they are for humans in case of an error. Before a format is chosen, the file based formats are tested on how well they perform when being parsed. An optimal solution is to simultaneously log to a database for pattern recognition and log to CSV in case an error occurs. With the logs available in a suitable format the information has to be gathered on a central system. Chapter 6 considers two possible centralisation strategies that can be used. After the two strategies, file transfer and database replication, have been analysed, they are evaluated with regard to load balance, network capacity and security. Database replication is considered to be the preferred strategy to be used because it spreads the load more evenly over time and the mechanism is built into the database system. Chapter 7 talks about how the data is stored once it is available on a central location. First a generic approach is discussed that can be applied to logging in general where a distinct split is made between the log 4 j part and the application specific part. Then a conversion specific approach is taken which handles data extension, aggregation and validation. Finally an additional aggregation step is discussed for performance enhancement. As the statistical information is now stored the data needs to be visualised in a intuitive way. First several use case are discussed in Chapter 8. To be able to handle with more use cases a template framework is developed which can contain multiple chart types. Next the statistic types are discussed that enable specific calculations to be performed for a specific statistic and hide the data processing from the templates and chart types. After that the user interface and the structure behind it are examined. Finally the extendibility of the system is outlined together with performance enhancements. Chapter 9 covers software quality and testing. Initially unit tests were developed to test an important building block of the system, the state machines. With the unit tests written a code coverage analysis is performed to see how well code is covered by tests. Because of some imper- fections in the logging, not all logged sessions adhered to the state machines while they were in fact valid. For these sessions to be taken into account some shortcuts were added to the state machines. Regression testing enables these sessions to be used while still preserving the quality of the software by explicitly testing for these sneak paths. In Chapter 10 the conclusions of Chapters 4 through 8, regarding the five distinct steps in the process, are consolidated. After that, conclusions are drawn about the three sub-goals as outlined in Chapter 1. Regarding the live data <b>feed</b> for <b>merchants</b> the project has been successful. Merchants that got a glance of the user interface during development were very enthusiastic about the possibilities the system gives them. The goal of providing data for marketing material also has been met. On multiple occasions during the development, sales employees used the statistical data and its graphical representations as a Unique Selling Point to show Adyens expertise in the payment process. During the project a basis has been formed for a newspaper article, as well as a scientific article, thereby fulfilling the third goal. The newspaper article concerns the conversion ratio of PayPal payments. PayPal does not perform as well as other (localised) payment methods in the Netherlands, while introducing higher costs. A scientific article can be written on the basis of the generic logging framework and the preparations that have been made during this project for this framework. During the process, a broad range to topics was touched but not all could be researched within the scope of the project. In Chapter 11 several recommendations are made for topics that should be investigated further. These topics include the creation of a generic logging framework that can be used throughout the platform as well as system that allows merchants to upload multiple Skins and compare the results. Finally more research can be done on pattern recognition to improve the rate of successfully reconstructed sessions as well as the creation of a generic framework to measure performance throughout Adyen’s platform on multiple levels. In order to be feasible, all of these frameworks should be highly scalable to cope with large amounts of data. They should also be generic enough to be applied on multiple levels, ranging from the application level to a platform level.

40|$|Recorremos à noção de Complexo Agroindustrial (CAI) para examinar a fonte do poder político que mantém os programas de subsídios em funcionamento, mesmo diante de toda contestação estadunidense e estrangeira a eles. Concluímos que os subsídios conferem às fazendas a capacidade de continuar funcionando numa lógica que privilegia os negócios de diversos segmentos dos CAI, apesar de elas serem frequentemente deficitárias. Neste contexto, é improvável que as políticas de subsídio sejam resultado apenas do interesse de grupos de produtores agrícolas. O objetivo da tese não é refutar a análise pluralista ¿ a dominante ¿ da concessão de subsídios agrícolas. É oferecer um ângulo alternativo e complementar para a análise deste fenômeno. Nosso estudo sobre a economia política dos CAI demonstra que diversos interesses, incluindo os de Estado, compõem os consensos que ordenam o funcionamento da acumulação capitalista nos referidos Complexos. As fazendas produtoras de {{commodities}} subsidiadas são peças muito importantes para a dinamização de setores intimamente ligados à sofisticada agricultura estadunidense, dos quais destacamos quatro: fornecedores de insumos agrícolas (maquinário, químicos, sementes etc.); processadores (indústria alimentícia e de rações, mercadores); serviços financeiros (crédito, seguros); setor imobiliário (proprietários de terras). O Estado, por sua vez, é ator interessado neste modelo e não apenas uma arena onde grupos societais travam disputas políticas. Conclui-se que a resiliência dos subsídios agrícolas nos EUA decorre de uma fonte de poder político muito maior e mais difusa do que a que emana das cerca de 40 % das fazendas americanas que recebem subsídios. The mainstream {{analysis of}} agricultural protectionism in the U. S. emphasizes {{the relationships between}} interest groups and legislators, {{as well as the}} institutional environments in which agricultural legislation is drafted. Although these relationships are of highest importance, agricultural policy should be examined in a larger and more complex context, since agricultural activity itself, within farms, is {{only a small part of}} the agrifood systems responsible for most of the food and fibers supply. We resort to the notion of Agroindustrial Complex (CAI, in Portuguese) to examine the source of the political power that keeps the subsidy programs in operation, even with all the American and foreign criticism to them. We conclude that subsidies allow farms the ability to continue running in a logic that favors the business of various segments of the CAI, although the farms are often deficient. In this context, it is unlikely that the subsidy policies are the result of farm groups¿ interest only. The aim of the thesis is not to refute the dominant, pluralist analysis of the politics agricultural subsidies. It is to offer an alternative and complementary perspective to analyze this phenomenon. Our study of the political economy of CAI shows that various interests, including the State ones, arrange the consensus that orders the functioning of capitalist accumulation in these Complexes. The farms producing subsidized commodities are very important pieces for the dynamics of sectors closely related to the sophisticated American agriculture, of which four are highlighted: agricultural inputs suppliers (machinery, chemicals, seeds, etc.); processors (food and animal <b>feed</b> industry, <b>merchants),</b> financial services (credit, insurance), real estate (land owners). The State, in turn, is an actor interested in this model and not just an arena where societal groups engage in political disputes. We conclude that the resilience of agricultural subsidies in the U. S. stems from a source of political power far greater and more diffuse than that that emanates from nearly 40 % of all American farms that receive subsidies...|$|R
40|$|The Extension {{program was}} {{supported}} by the Cherry County Farm Bureau for the year ending November 20, 1937. Farm family memberships were the basis for securing funds to finance the educational budget adopted by the directors of the county Farm Bureau. Added financial assistance was given by the Cherry County Commissioners. Business houses at the county seat subscribed funds for the calf show and other special events sponsored {{as a part of the}} year 2 ̆ 7 s program. The total cost of the year 2 ̆ 7 s program amounted to 2272. 52. Eighteen men elected geographically, four women elected from project groups, and the president of the Agricultural Conservation Association, were designated as the directors of the county Farm Bureau. Budget details end maintenance of the organization were handled by means of eight directors meetings. Thirty-two germination tests were secured for farmers having field crop seeds to sell. At least 5000. 00 would be an estimated value of seeds sold through the assistance of the exchange service at the county office. This servlce was made available to approximately six hundred farmers. The spring wheat variety test conducted last year was repeated this year. The purpose of the test was to demonstrate to farmers through field observations the difference in yielding ability, susceptibility to disease, time of maturity, and other agronomic qualities of the different varieties. The varieties tested were Ceres, Thatcher, and Komar. From reports for other tests conducted over the state, Ceres and Komar are recommended for general planting. Thatcher, which is a new rust resistant variety trom Minnesota, deserves further testing. A sorghum variety test result demonstration meeting was conducted. The test is a continuation of the tests conducted by the Valentine substation during the last few years. With corn a near failure the grain sorghums yielded from five to twelve bushels per acre. Only the early maturing varieties show acceptable results. Amber varieties of forage sorghums outyielded corn by a ratio of two tons to one. Forage acreage in 1937 was double that of 1936. Drouth and grasshoppers seriously reduced the carrying capacity of the range and pastures this year. Range management practices were developed as part of the Agricultural Conservation Program. Deterred grazing and pasture rotation was the central theme of this program. The exchange service assisted with the exchange of hay and surplus range valued at a minimum of 17, 000. 00. 45, 500 Clarke-McNary seedlings were distributed to sixty-nine cooperators. Poultry production was reduced to about one-third normal volume this year because of high feed prices. The Nebraska 8 -SG formula was introduced to flock owners. Arrangements made with local <b>feed</b> <b>merchants</b> to supply <b>feed</b> of this formula reduced costs by fifty cents to 1. 25 per cwt. Control of livestock diseases and parasites, including blackleg, Bang 2 ̆ 7 s disease, and anthrax in cattle, and sleeping sickness and botflies in horses. were major issues. An educational program of prevention through sanitation and other measures prescribed by Department of Agriculture specialists was carried to all stockmen. Two hundred seven families were assisted by the Resettlement Administration by means of grants totaling 23, 077. 50. Two hundred twenty-nine cars of feed were shipped into the county at reduced rates, effecting a saving of approximately 17, 000. 00. Thirty-nine new seed loans were made by the Farm Credit administration, totaling 5, 345. 00. Thirty-four standard loans were serviced through the Resettlement Administration. Six hundred twelve cropland farmers made application to participate in the Agricultural Conservation Program. At the close of the year compliance was determined on five hundred thirty-three farms, with 107, 095 acres of cropland. 5, 129 acres of legumes were seeded. 7, 590 acres of cropland were fallowed. 2, 886 acres of cropland were abandoned for restoration to native grass. 11, 511 acres of plow pasture were rested. Estimated benefit payments earned total approximately 75, 000. 00. Two hundred ninety-six ranches covering an area of 1, 472, 382 acres participated in the range program. 286, 176 acres of pasture were approved for deferred grazing benefit payments. Total range payments to come into the county are estimated at 61, 437. 00. At the close of this report year administrative expenses totaled 14, 600 1000. The budget adopted covering costs to March 1, 1938 totals 21, 161. 57. The first annual meeting of the 2 ̆ 2 Farm Bureau 2 ̆ 2 was held December 4, 1936. Winter storms reduced attendance to but a few members. The directors asked for the second annual members 2 ̆ 7 meeting to be held in the summer time. A picnic held at the Valentine Park in August drew an attendance of about one hundred seventy. The program included 4 -H achievement events, games, a picnic dinner, an address by Newton Gaines, and a moving picture program during the evening. One hundred fifty-nine news stories concerning Extension activities were submitted to nine local weekly papers. Ninety-seven circular letters were mailed. Two issues of 2 ̆ 2 Extension Notes 2 ̆ 2 edited by the agent were circularized. Seventeen district conferences were attended by the agent and committees, or office assistants. The agent also attended the annual Extension conference. Twenty-two Home Demonstration Project Clubs, with a total membership of two hundred sixty-eight, were enrolled through the winter ot 1936 - 37. Four of these clubs sent leaders to training meetings at Gordon. Five clubs sent leaders to Mullen, and twelve sent leaders to Ainsworth, gave the leaders training at Valentine and at Mullen. The Home Agent, Miss Helen Rocke, with headquarters at Alliance, gave the leaders training at Gordon. Leaders trained held one hundred twenty-seven local demonstration meetings with a total attendance of 1268 ladies. The seoond annual calf show was held October 20 and 21, 1937. Twenty-five Purebred Herefords were exhibited by six prominent breeders. Thirteen members of four Stocker-Feeder 4 -H Clubs exhibited calves from their projects. Thirty-six ranchers exhibited one thousand head of good, choice and prime feeder calves. Following the Judging some eight hundred twenty feeders were offered at auction to 4 -H Club buyers from corn belt counties in Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, and Ohio, and to other feeder buyers. One hundred twenty-six different boys and girls enrolled for a like number of projects in twelve clubs. The projects included 2 ̆ 2 Stocker-Feeder 2 ̆ 2, carried by four clubs; 2 ̆ 2 Baby Beef 2 ̆ 2 by one club; 2 ̆ 2 Learning to Sew 2 ̆ 2 by two clubs; 2 ̆ 2 Summer Clothes 2 ̆ 2 by one club; 2 ̆ 2 Learning to be a Homemaker 2 ̆ 2 by two clubs; 2 ̆ 2 Learning to Cook 2 ̆ 2 by one club. and 2 ̆ 2 Certified Grains 2 ̆ 2 by one club; In addition, two members of a Brown County club carried 2 ̆ 2 Baby Beef 2 ̆ 2 projects. Of these clubs seven completed achievement clubs. The seven include three stocker-feeder, one learning to sew, one summer clothes, one learning to cook, and one learning to be a homemaker projects. Seventy-eight achievement members completed their work in these clubs. The fourth stocker-feeder club, with twelve members enrolled and five completing their projects, tailed to turn in final reports and leader 2 ̆ 7 s summary. A club of girls carrying the learning to be a homemaker and second course in girls room projects tailed to file complete enrollment and final reports. One study club organized at Wood Lake in 1934 is continuing with this work. All others have changed to project demonstration work. Forty farmers scattered 10, 000 pounds of poison bran on one thousand acres of crops to combat grasshopper infestation. Poisoning has not proved practiceable nor effective in the range land. It is estimated that outworms damaged some thirty percent of the corn planted. Poisoning by means of a homemade distributor was promoted as control.
