5|$|The cost of {{clamping}} down on {{the protests}} was a loss of legitimacy, {{and the emergence of}} Amin al-Hafiz as the first Ba'athist military strongman. The traditional elite, consisting of the upper classes, who had been overthrown from political power by the Ba'athists, <b>felt</b> <b>threatened</b> by the Ba'ath Party's socialist policies. The Muslim Brotherhood in Syria was a historical rival of the Syrian Regional Branch, and it <b>felt</b> <b>threatened</b> by the party's secular nature. Akram al-Hawrani and his supporters and the Syrian Communist Party opposed the one-party system which the Ba'ath Party was establishing.|$|E
5|$|According to the Uherský Brod mayor , 's {{family members}} tried to prevent Kovář from having the license renewed by {{pleading}} with his general practitioner not to grant him the necessary health clearance, since they <b>felt</b> <b>threatened</b> and considered him mentally unstable. Nevertheless, Kovář received clearance from his general practitioner and presented it {{as a part}} of his license renewal application on 19 January 2015.|$|E
5|$|At an {{editorial}} meeting of Jyllands-Posten ("The Jutland Post", Denmark's largest daily newspaper) on 19 September, reporter Stig Olesen mooted {{the idea of}} asking {{the members of the}} newspaper illustrators union if {{they would be willing to}} draw Muhammad. This would be an experiment to see the degree to which professional illustrators <b>felt</b> <b>threatened.</b> Flemming Rose, culture editor, was interested in the idea and wrote to the 42 members of the union asking them to draw their interpretations of Muhammad.|$|E

50|$|The {{number of}} {{engineers}} increased by 2000 {{percent in the}} period between 1880 and 1920 in the United States. The Industrial revolution created a demand for them. Their main competition was Germany. Industries encouraged engineering to change from a craft to a profession. The standardization of practices during this time helped established their professional image as expertise. That being said, many factory and business and factory owners did not particularly like this standardization because they <b>felt</b> <b>threaten</b> that engineers would increase their authority and territory. This was also desired by engineers themselves to end labor troubles. It was believed that it would increase production and predictability.|$|R
50|$|However Jonathan was not idle. He {{continued}} activities {{against the}} Jews {{influenced by the}} Hellenistic civilization. Two years after the departure of Bacchides from Judea, Acra <b>felt</b> sufficiently <b>threatened</b> to contact Demetrius and request the return of Bacchides to their territory.|$|R
5|$|Arana's support {{began to}} be {{solicited}} by the landed elite, who <b>felt</b> <b>threatened</b> by Arévalo's reforms. Arana, who was not initially inclined {{to get involved with}} politics, began to make occasional statements against the government. In the 1948 parliamentary election, he backed a number of opposition candidates, all of whom were defeated. By 1949 the National Renovation Party and the PAR were both openly hostile to Arana, while a small fragment of the Popular Liberation Front split off to support him. The leftist parties decided to back Árbenz instead, as they believed that only a military officer could defeat Arana.|$|E
5|$|Jack Black and Kyle Gass {{initially}} met in Los Angeles in 1985, both {{members of}} the theatre troupe, The Actors' Gang. Black admits the duo did not {{see eye to eye}} due to animosity between the two as Gass was the main musician for the Actor's Gang and <b>felt</b> <b>threatened</b> by Black. The Actor's Gang travelled to Edinburgh, Scotland for Edinburgh Fringe in 1989. They were performing Tim Robbins' and Adam Simon's play Carnage. After arriving home from the trip, the two became close friends and Black would regularly visit Gass's Cochran Avenue studio apartment in the deal that Gass would teach Black guitar in return for food, mainly from fast-food chain Jack in the Box.|$|E
5|$|The jury {{agreed with}} Adams and acquitted {{six of the}} {{soldiers}} after two and one-half hours' deliberation. Two of the soldiers were found guilty of manslaughter because there was overwhelming evidence that they had fired directly into the crowd. The jury's decisions suggest that they believed the soldiers had <b>felt</b> <b>threatened</b> by the crowd, but should have delayed firing. Patrick Carr, the fifth victim, corroborated this with deathbed testimony delivered to his doctor. The convicted soldiers were granted reduced sentences by invoking Benefit of clergy, which reduced their punishment from a death sentence to branding of the thumb in open court.|$|E

50|$|Despite this, {{this type}} of {{perception}} has been challenged more recently by modern historians. The British historian Lawrence James has argued that, during the early 20th century, the British <b>felt</b> increasingly <b>threatened</b> by rival powers such as Germany, Russia, and the United States.|$|R
50|$|According to Col. Charles Beckwith's memoirs, this counter-terrorist {{group was}} formed by U.S. Army Special Forces {{leadership}} who disagreed with or <b>felt</b> politically <b>threatened</b> by Beckwith's Delta Force, which existed outside the Special Forces hierarchy. He stated that the unit was disbanded when Delta Force went operational.|$|R
5|$|From the beginning, the {{alliance}} {{was much more}} valuable to the Commonwealth than to Prussia. Soon after the treaty was signed, the international situation, and changes within the Commonwealth, made the treaty much less valuable to the Prussian side. Meanwhile, the Commonwealth embarked {{on a series of}} major internal reforms, seeing {{the alliance}} as a guarantee that it had the backing of a powerful neighbor in this process – where in fact Prussia felt those reforms were not in its best interest, and <b>felt</b> <b>threatened</b> by them. When Russia invaded the Commonwealth in May 1792, Prussia refused a request to honor the alliance and intervene, arguing that it was not consulted with regard to the 3rd May Constitution, which invalidated the alliance. A few months later, in 1793, Prussia aided Russia in the suppression of the Kościuszko Uprising.|$|E
5|$|Recording {{sessions}} and meetings for No Doubt's third studio album Tragic Kingdom (1995) began in 1993 between members Eric Stefani, Gwen Stefani, Tony Kanal, Tom Dumont, Adrian Young, and musician Gary Angle. The material produced with Angle was hugely rejected by Interscope Records' officials, {{and had the}} members work with producer Matthew Wilder instead. Upset with working with someone outside the band, Eric eventually stopped recording with the band, and encouraged the remaining members to write the group's songs, as he <b>felt</b> <b>threatened</b> when he did so. After Kanal broke off his seven-year relationship with Gwen, both of them wrote several more songs, until there was enough material for an album. The single's inspiration came when Kanal was having a fight with Stefani, his then-girlfriend, through the bathroom door of his parents' house in Yorba Linda, California; Stefani later revamped the lyrics to discuss her breakup with Kanal.|$|E
5|$|Thi oversaw I Corps with a {{great deal}} of autonomy, and the other {{officers}} <b>felt</b> <b>threatened,</b> which was accentuated by Thi's alignment with Buddhist activist movements in his region, traditionally a Buddhist stronghold. The Buddhists were opposed to expansion of the Vietnam War and the American leadership viewed Thi negatively. In early 1966, feeling more confident about his hold on power, Kỳ orchestrated Thi's removal, and announced that Thi would be going to the US for medical treatment, but in reality into exile. Thi refused to go along with Kỳ's false story and wanted to stay in Vietnam, and this led to civil unrest in I Corps, where Thi was popular. The disquiet escalated into open rebellion by pro-Thi military units, allied to Buddhist anti-junta activists who were calling for civilian government and an end to the US-driven war expansion policy. After three months of virtual secession, Kỳ's forces quelled the dissidents, and Thi emigrated to the U.S., where he lived for the rest of his life.|$|E
5000|$|In 2010 cables leaked by Wikileaks {{showed that}} Polish diplomats <b>felt</b> more <b>threatened</b> by Russia than by Iran.

25|$|The Kulturkampf made Catholics more resolute; {{they responded}} not with {{violence}} but with votes, {{and as the}} newly formed Center Party became {{a major force in}} the Imperial Parliament, it gained support from non-Catholic minorities who <b>felt</b> <b>threatened</b> by Bismarck's centralization of power.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} she was ten, Stuart had begun to follow in the {{footsteps}} of her writer grandmother. She had begun a French novel and had also started planning a Roman play. She <b>felt</b> <b>threatened</b> by her brothers, who teased her about her learning.|$|E
25|$|Several {{historians of}} the 1960s and 1970s portrayed the Mugwumps {{as members of}} an {{insecure}} elite, one that <b>felt</b> <b>threatened</b> by changes in American society. These historians often focused on the social background and status of their subjects, and the narratives they have written share a common outlook.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{findings of}} a 1987 - 1988 survey of 966 {{parents of children with}} serious emotional disturbances. The questionnaire addressed issues concerned with seeking and receiving information and services, sources of formal and informal support, and perceptions of the effect of their child's disability on family life. Among specific issues addressed are requirements that parents relinquish legal custody when seeking publicly funded residential treatment (one-quarter of parents had faced this issue) and parents who <b>felt</b> physically <b>threatened</b> by their children (44 percent sometimes <b>felt</b> physically <b>threatened).</b> Other issues addressed included: involvement with professionals (social workers and psychologists were most frequently named); service needs and utilization (financial assistance, support groups, and respite care appeared to be unmet needs); information needs and utilization (information about transition planning and help for siblings were identified as most needed and most difficult t...|$|R
50|$|The {{partition}} of British India created a conflict over the plentiful {{waters of the}} Indus basin. The newly formed states were at odds over how to share and manage what was essentially a cohesive and unitary network of irrigation. Furthermore, the geography of partition was such that the source rivers of the Indus basin were in India. Pakistan <b>felt</b> its livelihood <b>threatened</b> {{by the prospect of}} Indian control over the tributaries that fed water into the Pakistani portion of the basin. Where India certainly had its own ambitions for the profitable development of the basin, Pakistan <b>felt</b> acutely <b>threatened</b> by a conflict over the main source of water for its cultivable land.|$|R

25|$|The Magyar {{national}} reawakening therefore triggered national revivals {{among the}} Slovak, Romanian, Serbian, and Croatian minorities within Hungary and Transylvania, who <b>felt</b> <b>threatened</b> by both German and Magyar cultural hegemony. These national revivals later blossomed into the nationalist {{movements of the}} {{nineteenth and twentieth centuries}} that contributed to the empire's ultimate collapse.|$|E
25|$|One month later, on September 8, Rigdon was excommunicated {{from the}} church by a Common Council of the Church which had been convened by Presiding Bishop Newel K. Whitney.

Rigdon fled Nauvoo, claiming that he <b>felt</b> <b>threatened</b> by Young's supporters.|$|E
25|$|Protests in California were {{marred by}} racial incidents.

25|$|Feelings {{throughout}} the Falls Church region were inflamed by this point, and the polling {{did not take}} place peacefully. Armed men belonging to Virginia's Rappahannock Cavalry and Fairfax Cavalry intimidated pro-Union voters, many of whom <b>felt</b> physically <b>threatened.</b> And with reason: in the days following, many northern-born residents fled Falls Church to the safety of Washington.|$|R
5000|$|It is said Jews did not {{rank among}} the [...] "economic elite of many British cities" [...] in the 19th century. Again, the {{significance}} in this is that British Protestants and non-Jews <b>felt</b> less <b>threatened</b> by Jews {{because they were not}} imposing on their prosperity and were not responsible for the economic achievements of their nation.|$|R
50|$|His uncle Henry I of Werle {{was killed}} in 1291 by his sons Henry II and Nicholas, because he had {{remarried}} and they <b>felt</b> this <b>threatened</b> their inheritance. After a prolonged war, Nicholas II defeated his cousins, who had formed an alliance with Lord Henry II of Mecklenburg and Elector Albert III of Brandenburg. This allowed him to reunite Werle-Parchim and Werle-Güstrow.|$|R
25|$|Under Pius X, the {{traditionally}} difficult situation of Polish Catholics in Russia did not improve. Although Nicholas II of Russia issued a decree 22 February 1903, promising religious {{freedom for the}} Catholic Church, and, in 1905, promulgated a constitution, which included religious freedom, the Russian Orthodox Church <b>felt</b> <b>threatened</b> and insisted on stiff interpretations. Papal decrees were not permitted and contacts with the Vatican remained outlawed.|$|E
25|$|The {{soldiers}} were virtually mutinous {{by the time}} Captain David Collins arrived on 16 February 1804. Fed up with poor rations, forced labour, and surly convicts to guard, the men had all but lost any respect for Lieutenant Bowen. Bowen immediately <b>felt</b> <b>threatened</b> {{by the arrival of}} Collins, and for a time refused to accept his command. Eventually Bowen departed aboard Ocean to seek confirmation from Governor King.|$|E
25|$|There {{was much}} debate about {{possible}} routes that a canal could take. Coal merchants in Liverpool <b>felt</b> <b>threatened</b> about a canal {{that could bring}} coal in from Cheshire. The owners of the River Weaver Navigation were also not happy about the proposals, because the route would almost parallel that of the river. Yet another route was published which, much to the shock of Wedgwood, did not at all include the potteries.|$|E

Thereafter she <b>felt</b> increasingly <b>threatened</b> {{by the success of}} Betty Nansen. Her last role was the Jewish women Gerda Sommer in Henri Nathansen's Daniel Hertz.|$|R
50|$|She {{continued}} writing, finishing {{her last}} realistic novels and collections of short stories. She also entered {{the public debate}} on topical themes: women's emancipation and other ethical and moral issues.

The WCIP {{believes}} that indigenous peoples {{have experienced a}} shared history of intimidation, threat, deprivation, injustice, discrimination and genocide, and have <b>felt</b> themselves <b>threatened</b> by extinction. They seek rights to self-determination and self-government, as the WCIP believes that colonialism has rendered them vulnerable to domination and control by more powerful nations and peoples.|$|R
