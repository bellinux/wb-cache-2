25|$|An {{assessment}} by Health Canada {{found that}} cancer mortality rates are almost identical {{in the two}} countries. Another <b>international</b> <b>comparison</b> by the National Cancer Institute of Canada indicated that incidence rates for most, but not all, cancers {{were higher in the}} U.S. than in Canada during the period studied (1993–1997). Incidence rates for certain types, such as colorectal and stomach cancer, were actually higher in Canada than in the U.S. In 2004, researchers published a study comparing health outcomes in the Anglo countries. Their analysis indicates that Canada has greater survival rates for both colorectal cancer and childhood leukemia, while the United States has greater survival rates for Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as well as breast and cervical cancer.|$|E

25|$|In the <b>international</b> <b>comparison</b> {{of modern}} tort law, common law jurisdictions based upon English tort law have {{foundational}} differences from civil law jurisdiction, {{which may be}} based on the Roman concept of delict. Even among common law countries, however, significant differences exist. For example, in England legal fees of the winner are paid by the loser (the English rule versus the American rule of attorney fees). Common law systems include United States tort law, Australian tort law, Canadian tort law, Irish tort law, and Scots Law of Delict. The Jewish law of rabbinic damages is another example although tort in Israeli law is technically similar to English law as it was enacted by British Mandate of Palestine authorities in 1944 and took effect in 1947. There is more apparent split between the Commonwealth countries (principally England, Canada and Australia) and the United States, although Canada may be more influenced by the United States due to its proximity.|$|E

The price of water will increase to a range of EGP0.45-2.15/m3 ($0.03-$0.12/m3). Tariffs for industrial and commercial customers are much higher than residential tariffs. Businesses thus will pay up to EGP6.95/m3 ($0.39/m3).|$|E

2500|$|In {{terms of}} {{population}} health, life expectancy in 2006 {{was about two}} and a half years longer in Canada, with Canadians living to an average of 79.9 years and Americans 77.5 years. Infant and child mortality rates are also higher in the U.S. Some comparisons suggest that the American system underperforms Canada's system as well as those of other industrialized nations with universal coverage. For example, a ranking by the World Health Organization of health care system performance among 191 member nations, published in 2000, ranked Canada 30th and the U.S. 37th, and the overall health of Canada 35th to the American 72nd. [...] The WHO did not merely consider health care outcomes, but also placed heavy emphasis on the health disparities between rich and poor, funding for the health care needs of the poor, and the extent to which a country was reaching the potential health care outcomes they believed were possible for that nation. In an <b>international</b> <b>comparison</b> of 21 more specific quality indicators conducted by the Commonwealth Fund International Working Group on Quality Indicators, the results were more divided. One of the indicators was a tie, and in 3 others, data was unavailable from one country or the other. Canada performed better on 11 indicators; such as survival rates for colorectal cancer, childhood leukemia, and kidney and liver transplants. The U.S. performed better on 6 indicators, including survival rates for breast and cervical cancer, and avoidance of childhood diseases such as pertussis and measles. [...] It should be noted that the 21 indicators were distilled from a starting list of 1000.
