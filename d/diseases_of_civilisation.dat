50|$|The body’s primary {{response}} {{to an increase in}} dietary carbohydrate is to increase insulin production. Wolfgang Lutz demonstrated that his obese patients often suffered from an overproduction of insulin and identified a see-sawing of compensatory hormonal measures: typically, an increase in insulin, thyroid and adrenal hormones, and a decrease in the growth hormone. Sex hormones were also affected. Lutz was the first to describe how these disturbances in hormonal regulation and their very varied repercussions underlay many of the <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> <b>civilisation.</b>|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the first}} part of this bachelor´s thesis is to explain and {{describe}} the basic terms which were used as <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> <b>civilisation,</b> gen, genome, nutrigenomics, nutrigenetics. The second part of this work focuses on the characterization and description of some of the most often occurring <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> <b>civilisation</b> in this world as obesity, diabetes mellitus or cardiovascular diseases and it has to point at possible causes of their formation and prevention. In the following chapters knowledge and practises of nutrigenomics were used during searching for the reasons of formation and prevention of civilisation diseases. Nutrigenomics is relatively a young discipline of science and only future research and monitoring will show its possible meaning in the future. The main goal of this work was to summarize and clearly demonstrate information about given theme from various information sources...|$|E

40|$|Diverticulosis of {{the colon}} is quite {{frequent}} in developed countries and prevalence rises with age. Although up to two-thirds of people older than age 80 years are affected, most remain asymptomatic. The causes of colonic diverticula include alterations in colonic wall resistance, disordered colonic motility, and dietary deficiencies, especially fibre. Clinical manifestations of this disorder range from non-specific intermittent abdominal pain to potentially life-threatening complications such as diverticulitis or haemorrhage. CT scanning and colonoscopy are important in diagnosis and management. Here, we review epidemiology, causes, clinical presentation, and manage-ment <b>of</b> diverticular <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> the colon. Epidemiology Prevalence of colonic diverticulosis is difficult to measure because most patients are asymptomatic. In early (1920 – 1940) autopsy and barium enema series, rates of 2 – 10 % were reported. 1 Data show a substantial rise in colonic diverticula within the past few decades. Prevalence <b>of</b> diverticular <b>disease</b> increases with age, from less than 10 % in people younger than age 40 years to 50 – 66 % in patients older than age 80 years. 1 – 3 No sex differences seem to exist. Diverticulosis has been labelled a <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> western <b>civilisation</b> because <b>of</b> its striking geographic variability. The disorder is rare in rural Africa and Asia, with the highest prevalence seen in the USA, Europe, and Australia. 1 Within a given country, the incidence of colonic diverticula can vary in ethnic groups—eg, in Chinese inhabitants of Singapore, incidence {{was reported to be}} 0 · 14 cases per million population per year versus 5 · 41 cases in Europeans. 4 Urbanisation within a country over time can also lead to a rise in prevalence of diverticulosis. Follow-up in Singapore has indicated colonic diverticulosis in 19 %, an increas...|$|R

Indians have a higher inci-dence of diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction, duodenal ulcer, acute appendicitis, gallstones, renal stones and eclampsia.

40|$|Summary. John Dudgeon, a Scottish {{physician}} practising {{medicine in}} China {{in the second}} half of the nineteenth century, wrote extensively on the diet, dress, housing and social customs of the Chinese and their implications for health. While Dudgeon’s contemporaries were highly critical of Chinese sanitary conditions and personal hygiene, he argued that China’s lifestyle and urban conditions were superior to those in Europe. Dudgeon’s observations in China, combined with his views on deteriorating economic conditions and heightened social tensions in Scotland, resulted in his critical reflections on British metropolitan culture and lifestyle. His admiration of Chinese hygiene and his conception of the <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> <b>civilisation</b> were closely connected to his nostalgic vision of a paterna-listic society. It is the contention of this paper that Dudgeon’s eccentric medical ideas manifested the interplay between metropolitan medical theories and the overseas experiences of a British physician in China...|$|E
40|$|The {{current state}} Prevention {{is a complex}} care of a patient when {{we are trying to}} prevent from the {{occurrence}} or development of a disease, or when we want to prevent from its consequences and mitigate them. Recommendations for prevention set by a doctor must be on a scientific basis, and they must be a part of all branches of medicine. Their effectiveness depends on the cooperation between patients and medical staff. The basic and most efficient method of prevention is the health promotion and health education, which is closely associated with it. The term health promotion involves a set of activities and precautions for the purpose of making health better and sustaining it. <b>Diseases</b> <b>of</b> <b>civilisation</b> (hereinafter "DoC") are groups of diseases which are distinguished by their association to our lifestyles. Human body is more and more threatened from unfavourable influences of external environment, such as the quality of atmosphere, work environment and environment itself, the lack of physical movement, unhealthy diet, smoking, and alcohol consumption. The list of <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> <b>civilisation</b> varies and changes together with our society and the development of our lifestyles. Among the most common or frequent diseases of current time are cardiovascular diseases, which involve atherosclerosis, hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary artery disease and obesity. Furthermore, between civilization diseases include diabetes mellitus type 2 or cancer, etc. The goal of the thesis There are two goals set for this paper. The first goal was {{to find out what the}} role of a nurse in the prevention of <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> <b>civilisation</b> was. The second goal was to find out what the above mentioned role of a nurse was from the point of view of patients. Methodology For the purpose of the research part of this thesis, qualitative research using semistructured interviews was carried out. Respondents were divided into two groups; the first one consisted of eight nurses working at internal medicine and neurological department of the hospital in České Budějovice and a nurse working in a private office of a general practitioner for adult patients. The second group consisted of eight patients of the above mentioned health facilities. Results According to our findings, nurses and patients have different oppinions on the role of a nurse. Nurses in disease prevention see themselves as an equivalent to a doctor when undertaking this practice and giving guidance. The patient speaks only to the nurse who emphasized what they were told by the doctor and reiterated the main points. They make available to them leaflets and brochures or Internet resources. In contrast, most patients see a nurse as a more important source of information than the doctor. Patients have the feeling that the doctor does not have enough time or does not want to be botherd with questions. Rather the patient turns to his nurse, which they sees as more appropriate and someone to whom they can confide in without bothering. Summary The goal of the thesis was to focus on prevention, DoC, and the role of a nurse in the prevention of such diseases, as well as to study this issue, look at it from the point of view of patients and nurses via the interviews carried out in this paper, and to analyse such information. Based on this analysis are published recommendations for nurses and patients...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades edible fats and oils {{suffered}} a severe loss of image by being considered {{to be one of}} the main causes for the steady rise in overweight and <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> <b>civilisation</b> among the Western population. Numerous recent research studies on characteristics of specific fatty acids (type and composition) call for a paradigm shift reevaluating edible fats by placing greater emphasis on the quality rather than quantity of total fatty intake. This includes for instance, unhealthy LDL-increasing trans-fatty acids &# 8211; formed during the hydrogenation process of vegetable oils &# 8211; and saturated fatty acids from animal products. These ought to be replaced by vegetable oils of which rapeseed and olive oil are regarded to be particularly physiological point of view. Due to their high content of monoand polyunsaturated fatty acids in combination with a most suitable fatty acid pattern, they harbour a strong cardioprotective and anti-atherogenic potential. Other health promoting fatty sources &# 8211; as supported by the example of the Mediterranean Diet &# 8211; are fish rich in omega- 3 -fatty acids...|$|E
40|$|Children in {{developing}} countries pass stools that {{are very different from}} those passed by children in Europe. These stools reflect a diet of unrefined carbohydrate with low-energy density, and which due to the large volume results in an energy deficit in the child. This energy deficit is now considered to be the major cause of the almost universal undernutrition. Much of the improved health in European children during the last century has probably arisen through better nutrition due to more-refined carbohydrates and to more fat in the diet. Over the same period as children have become healthier, <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> <b>civilisation</b> have appeared. One factor in such diseases is clearly that of diet, and these diseases may partly be caused by the high-energy density and the low-dietary fibre content. Changes in diet offer the greatest hope for a rapid improvement in health. In the developing world we need to find a means for making foods with a high-energy density more easily available to overcome the undernutrition in childhood. In industrialised countries older children need to become accustomed to a diet of lower-energy than at present, containing more unrefined carbohydrate and less fat...|$|E
40|$|Bread is a {{universal}} and ancient staple that in Italy {{is regarded as the}} symbol of both food and national unity. Nonetheless, the great variety of breads dating back to Roman times and still available in the country recalls the political fragmentation of pre-Unification Italy. Furthermore, as it is essentially a cultural object, bread is closely intertwined with the social structure of Italian society whose cultural and dietary shifts, however, have adversely affected bread production and consumption. The latter, moreover, is also linked to the so-called <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> <b>civilisation</b> that actually constitute public health problems. The political aspects of bread analysed in this paper mainly pertain to the national and European legislation which establishes the characteristics and names of Italian bread, and to the gradual disappearance of artisan bakery that does not seem to attract the younger generations. The relationship between bread and environment, on the other hand, shows how climate change, pesticides, and fertilisers negatively impact on wheat production. Additionally, bread-making technology and the controversial issue relating to GM crops highlight the unavoidable role of biotechnology in the future nutritional scenario. A scenario that is likely to be dominated by healthy foods such as gluten-free, salt-free and functional breads...|$|E

40|$|Healthy {{lifestyle}} and eating habits acquired in {{childhood and adolescence}} have a great impact in life since they are associated with lower risk of <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> <b>civilisation</b> in adulthood. School meals in Slovenia are well organised {{and at least one}} meal is provided to children and students during school. The aim of our thesis was to analyse eating habits of secondary school students during school, their attitude towards school meals and the impact of abolishment of subsidized meals on students’ eating habits. A descriptive method was used to gather the necessary data. Data were collected from a questionnaire with questions about socio-demographic characteristics of interviewees, their eating habits and their attitude towards eating and school meals. Our study included 289 secondary school students. Our results demonstrate that Slovenian adolescents have poor eating habits even though they should have the correct nutrition of the highest quality. They consume too much sweets and sweet drinks and too little fruits and vegetables. Our results also show that 57, 8 % of interviewed students consume school meals less often compared to last year. Students agree the school meals are too expensive and they wish they were subsidized. Positive influence on students’ eating habits could be achieved by providing an adequate subsidy and by addressing issues regarding provision of suitable school meals...|$|E
40|$|Our genome adapts {{slowly to}} {{changing}} conditions of existence. Many <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> <b>civilisation</b> result from mismatches between our Paleolithic genome and the rapidly changing environment, including our diet. The {{objective of the}} present study was to reconstruct multiple Paleolithic diets to estimate the ranges of nutrient intakes upon which humanity evolved. A database of, predominantly East African, plant and animal foods (meat/fish) was used to model multiple Paleolithic diets, using two pathophysiological constraints (i. e. protein, 35 energy % (en%) and linoleic acid (LA) > 1. 0 en%), at known hunter-gatherer plant/animal food intake ratios (range 70 / 30 - 30 / 70 en%/en%). We investigated selective and non-selective savannah, savannah/aquatic and aquatic hunter-gatherer/scavenger foraging strategies. We found (range of medians in en%) intakes of moderate-to-high protein (25 - 29), moderate-to-high fat (30 - 39) and moderate carbohydrates (39 - 40). The fatty acid composition was SFA (11. 4 - 12. 0), MUFA (5. 6 - 18. 5) and PUFA (8. 6 - 15. 2). The latter was high in a-linolenic acid (ALA) (3. 7 - 4. 7 en%), low in LA (2. 3 - 3. 6 en%), and high in long-chain PUFA (LCP; 4. 75 - 25. 8 g/d), LCP n- 3 (2. 26 - 17. 0 g/d), LCP n- 6 (2. 54 - 8. 84 g/d), ALA/LA ratio (1. 12 - 1. 64 g/g) and LCP n- 3 /LCP n- 6 ratio (0. 84 - 1. 92 g/g). Consistent with the wide range of employed variables, nutrient intakes showed wide ranges. We conclude that compared with Western diets, Paleolithic diets contained consistently higher protein and LCP, and lower LA. These are likely to contribute to the known beneficial effects of Paleolithic-like diets, e. g. through increased satiety/satiation. Disparities between Paleolithic, contemporary and recommended intakes might be important factors underlying the aetiology of common Western diseases. Data on Paleolithic diets and lifestyle, rather than the investigation of single nutrients, might be useful for the rational design of clinical trials...|$|E

40|$|The {{standard}} <b>of</b> <b>civilisation</b> served Western {{states to}} hierarchically organise international politics and reproduce Western pre-eminence. Russia, {{depending on the}} historical period, has been interpreted as either an ardent follower or a major challenger to Western projects, {{but it has been}} markedly absent from debates regarding the standard. This article proposes to engage Russia in the standard <b>of</b> <b>civilisation</b> discussion with reference to the standard?s two most considered expositions: the colonial-era ?original? and what the literature interprets as the standard?s contemporary revival. In order to do so, I trace Russia?s nineteenth-century colonial practices and analyse Russia?s selected policies towards post-Soviet states in the post?Cold War period. On the basis of these explorations, I argue that Russia?s application of the standard <b>of</b> <b>civilisation</b> goes beyond the mere reproduction of hierarchical arrangements between an imagined centre and peripheries. The practices of the standard <b>of</b> <b>civilisation</b> have been employed to improve Russia?s desired, and imagined, status in international politics ? that of a great power equal to the West. From that it follows that the concept of the standard <b>of</b> <b>civilisation</b> should be recognised as ordering relations not only of the strong and the weak but also of those in position of power in international politics. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
