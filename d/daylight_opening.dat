50|$|Launched in July 1993 {{and sold}} until April 1995, the VR series came with an updated, sleeker and more modern design, {{as well as}} safety {{enhancements}} such as anti-lock brakes (ABS). From the side, the biggest change was the revised <b>daylight</b> <b>opening</b> around the C-pillar {{and the use of}} a round rear wheelarch, instead of a squared-off shape used on the previous VN and VP model Commodores. The VR Acclaim and Calais included a driver's side Supplemental Restraint System (SRS) air bag as standard, which was a first for an Australian car. They also had standard ABS brakes and independent rear suspension (IRS). The airbag, ABS brakes and IRS were also available across the range for both automatic transmission and manual transmission models. The rear-end treatment saw raised tail lamps, which were recessed high up on the boot lid for safety reasons. A new electronic version of the Turbo-Hydramatic 700R4 (TH700) automatic transmission was introduced, known as the GM 4L60-E. The VR Commodore was Wheels Car of the Year for 1993.|$|E

Syftet med studien är att bidra till kunskapen om hur dagsljusinsläppet påverkar upplevelsen av ett rum. Målet är att klargöra hur dagsljusinsläppets proportioner och placering påverkar hur det infallande ljuset uppträder i rummet och hur det inverkar på hur rummet upplevs. Studien är tänkt att kunna användas av planerare för att i trivsamhetssyfte skapa ett så bra dagsljusinsläpp som möjligt. Följande frågeställningar formulerades: Hur påverkar placeringen av dagsljusinsläppen upplevelsen av ett rum? Hur påverkar proportionerna av dagsljusinsläppen upplevelsen av ett rum? Hur mycket ljus kommer in i rummet med hänsyn till proportioner och placering av dagsljusinsläppen? Undersökningen inleddes med ett förexperiment där fönsterutformningar observerades i en modell för att sedan testas i ett fullskaleexperiment. Under experimentet gjordes enkätundersökningar på en urvalsgrupp om 20 personer som fick svara på frågor om rumsupplevelse, och därefter gjordes ljusmätningar i samtliga fyra experimentrum. Resultatet visar att stora dagsljusinsläpp ger en hög ljusnivå men bidrar till låg rumslighet, försämrade kontrastförhållanden och ökad risk för bländning. Mindre, lågt placerade horisontella dagsljusinsläpp ger i princip samma ljusnivå men skapar en bättre rumslighet och minskar risken för bländning. Med högt placerade horisontella dagsljusinsläpp visar resultatet en försämring av rumsupplevelsen då rummet upplevs slutet och instängt. Det har visat sig att fönsterytans area påverkar, men inte varit avgörande för hur dagsljusinsläppet påverkar upplevelsen av rummet, det ser ut som att placeringen istället haft mycket större påverkan på rumsupplevelsen. Det visar också att de mörkare rummen har högre rumslighet än de ljusare. Studien visar att testpersonerna trivdes bäst i rummet med lågt horisontellt placerade dagsljusinsläpp.  The {{background to}} this report is based on how architectural art through times been treating daylight with greatest precision {{to take advantage of}} its good quality, and how the technical revolution with artificial lighting affects our way of working with daylighting today. The purpose of the study is to contribute to the knowledge how the <b>daylight</b> <b>opening</b> affects the perception of a room. The aim is to clarify how proportions and placement affects how the incident light occurs in the room and how that affects on how the room is perceived. The study is meant to be used by lighting planners, and in terms of pleasantness, be able to create the best possible daylight environment. The following questions were formulated: How do the positions of daylight openings affect the perception of a room? How do the proportions of daylight openings affect the perception of a room? How much light enters the room as a result of proportions and placements of daylight openings? The investigation began with a pre-experiment where window configurations were observed in a scale model and then tested in a full-scale experiment. During the experiment surveys were made in a sample group of twenty people who had to answer questions about spatial experience, followed by lighting calculations that were made in all four experimental settings. The result shows that large daylight openings provide a high level of light but contribute to low spatiality, deterioration of contrasts and increased risk of glare. Smaller, low-set horizontal daylight openings tend to give the same levels of light but create a better sense of space and reduce glare. With high positioned horizontal daylight openings the result shows a deterioration of spatial experience and the room is perceived closed and stuffy. A vertical <b>daylight</b> <b>opening</b> is shown to make the room feel small and high, and the level of light is low, the contrast ratio and the completeness experienced worsening. The result shows that the window surface area affects the experience but is not essential how the daylight openings affect the perception of the room, it looks like the matter of placement have greatest impact on the room experience. It also shows that the darker rooms have higher spatiality than the lighter ones. The study shows that the test group liked the room with low-set horizontal daylight openings better. ...|$|E

40|$|Windows are {{important}} for a comfortable and healthy indoor environment, because they give access to daylight and an outside view. To be able to improve the visual quality of indoor spaces, one needs to have insight in how daylight and view affect people’s perception of indoor spaces. This is investigated {{by means of a}} literature and a questionnaire research in eight office buildings. The literature shows that many different variables affect the perception of daylight and view quality. The results of the questionnaire study give new insight in how these variables are related. Based on the research results a method is developed for the analysis of the daylight and view quality of windows, the D&V analysis method. The method combines different existing methods for the analysis of daylight with a new method for the assessment of view quality. Designers can use the analysis method to optimize the design of <b>daylight</b> <b>openings</b> during different phases of a building design.

40|$|The main {{topic of}} this thesis is {{daylight}} in buildings. More specifically, the thesis presents {{studies on the}} performance characteristics of venetian blinds used on the interior side of vertical windows. A particular emphasis is put on the daylighting properties of different blind types, {{and the performance of}} daylight redirecting blinds is compared to the performance of traditional white blinds. Three factors are highly important for daylight in buildings: the daylight source, the optical properties of the fenestration or daylighting system, and the characteristics of the architectural space that receives the daylight. Earlier works on daylighting systems in buildings have often documented the daylight levels and the daylight distribution within the space. With that approach {{it can be hard to}} pinpoint exactly why one daylighting system performs differently from another. For the work presented here it has been a goal to focus on the properties of the fenestration system itself, while operating under various daylight conditions that are relevant for high latitudes. Some assumptions have been made regarding the architectural space (sidelighted with an elevated <b>daylight</b> <b>opening),</b> but apart from this it has been sought to describe the system performance more or less independently from the architectural space. This approach can be compared to the approach that has been used in the field of electric lighting. There, luminaries are typically specified by performance characteristics that are not depending on the space in which they are to be applied. For electric luminaries, photometric properties such as luminous flux, light distribution and light output ratio are commonly used to describe the performance of the luminaire, and these values are independent of the space where the luminaire is to be used. In other words, in this thesis, the venetian blind system is treated more or less as a “daylight luminaire”. The main tool applied to analyse the photometric properties of the “daylight luminaire” is Monte Carlo forward ray tracing. The software TracePro is used extensively for this purpose. This software tool is tailor-made for analysing optical systems (including luminaries). Unfortunately, daylight sources are not available in TracePro. For this reason, a substantial effort was made in order to generate TracePro light sources that represent the light from ground, sky and sun. However, once these sources were established and validated, many positive features of the program could be utilised with good effect in order to quantify a variety of different photometric characteristics (e. g. transmittance, light distribution and luminance) of venetian blind systems. In order to analyse these characteristics in a systematic manner the fundamental geometrical properties of venetian blinds need to be understood and these properties have therefore been derived and described. A new evaluation method for daylight redirection systems is presented in this thesis. This method is based on quantification of performance metrics already applied for such systems combined with new performance indicators suggested on the basis of literature findings as well as own studies of venetian blind performance. The main goal of the new method is to provide a tool that can be used to indicate performance of a particular system with respect to 8 different important criteria that are determined by the properties of the daylighting system: (1) supply of daylight, (2) room darkening, (3) light distribution, (4) glare protection, (5) outward view, (6) privacy protection, (7) solar heat supply, and (8) overheating protection. Star diagrams are used to provide a graphical illustration of the performance of the systems, where each of the 8 star points represents one of the 8 performance criteria used to evaluate the system. The new evaluation method has been applied in order to compare the performance of traditional white blinds with that of daylight redirecting blinds. The results show that, when both blinds are operated in the semi-closed position, the performance is roughly the same for all of the performance criteria considered. However, when both blind types are operated in the open blind position, the daylight redirecting blind can perform better with respect to daylight supply and light distribution. The results presented in this thesis also show that these benefits can be obtained without worsening the performance with respect to the other criteria. The performance of blinds has been studied for daylight conditions that are representative for high latitudes. It has sometimes been argued that, due to the typical low sun conditions, especially during the winter months, daylight redirecting blinds are less suitable at high latitudes. However, results presented in this thesis show that daylight redirecting blinds can function very well under most sun conditions that are typical for high latitudes, provided that the spacing to width ratio is carefully selected.

40|$|Daylight and the {{availability}} of windows in close proximity to the workspace have always been thought to be more beneficial to the productivity of the worker than artificial lighting. A small number of manufacturers claim that the positive effects of daylight remain in situations with daylight transport systems, even though a view to the outside is nonexistent. If this is accurate, and the emotional effects of having a view are not relevant for the performance of office workers, {{it should be possible to}} reach the same positive effect on performance with artificial lighting, imitating daylight. This research focuses on the relation between the non-visual effect and the emotional effects that can be found when looking at <b>daylight</b> <b>openings.</b> Three test scenario’s have been set up and tested. In one of these scenarios the view to the outside was obstructed in order to remove one of the emotional parameters. In another scenario artificial lighting was used to emulate the daylight conditions. The results of this small scale preliminary study were unexpected. The performance of the test subjects increased when the view was removed. Next to this, the performance of the test subjects also increased when the daylight was replaced by an artificial light source. The question remains whether or not these effects can be linked to the view outside, or to other influences. Additional research is required...|$|R

40|$|A new {{decision-making}} {{tool that}} will assist designers {{in the selection}} of appropriate daylighting solutions for buildings in tropical locations has been previously proposed by the authors. Through an evaluation matrix that prioritizes the parameters that best respond to the needs of tropical climates (e. g. reducing solar gain and protection from glare) the tool determines the most appropriate devices for specific climate and building inputs. The tool is effective in demonstrating the broad benefits and limitations of the different daylight strategies for buildings in the tropics. However for thorough analysis and calibration of the tool, validation is necessary. This paper presents a first step in the validation process. RADIANCE simulations were conducted to compare simulation performance with the performance predicted by the tool. To this end, an office building case study in subtropical Brisbane, Australia, and five different <b>daylighting</b> devices including <b>openings,</b> light guiding systems and light transport systems were simulated. Illuminance, light uniformity, daylight penetration and glare analysis were assessed for each device. The results indicate the tool can appropriately rank and recommend daylighting strategies based on specific building inputs for tropical and subtropical regions, making it a useful resource for designers. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis article {{presents}} {{a case of}} heuristic optimization of cooling loads and daylighting levels in deep halls of Egyptian Universities, using DesignBuilder software, with EnergyPlus and Radiance engines, {{in order to show}} the vital role of simulation tools in architects’ hands. Generally speaking, campus buildings in Egypt reflect real problems of energy efficiency and indoor environmental quality of the overcrowded educational spaces. The case, studied in the article, is for three drawing halls of different specifications, located in the main building of the Faculty of Engineering at Mansoura University. The simulation work is processed along a road map of three consequent phases: simulating the existing situation of thermal and visual comfort inside the three halls; optimizing cooling loads by testing various alternatives of design parameters; and including daylighting levels in the optimization process. The study found that optimizing windows shading of overhangs and louvers, low-transmittance characteristics of glazing, and ventilation system would provide from 26 % to 31 % reduction of cooling loads compared to base case, without taking into account <b>daylighting</b> requirements. While, <b>opening</b> skylight strips, perpendicular to the external facade, with 8 % window–roof-ratio, would provide required daylighting levels with minimum increase of cooling loads. The principle objective, attained through this article, is to underline the significance of using building performance simulation (BPS) tools in the architectural educational and research work...|$|R
