500|$|Frank was not {{originally}} envisioned with a beard, however at {{the time}} of his casting, Fahey himself had one. Lindelof and Cuse felt that the beard worked with Lapidus' character, and allowed Fahey to keep it for the role, with the requirement he shave it back to a more manageable length. The character remained bearded until his return in fifth season episode [...] "316", set three years on from his original introduction. Fahey praised the way the character was developed to suit him, explaining that upon meeting with Lindelof and Cuse, rather than discussing the show with him, they were more interested in him personally and his experiences, going on to incorporate elements of himself into Lapidus. He expanded: [...] "The beauty of this is they'll <b>feed</b> <b>you</b> a concept based on an idea of who you are. The actor and the characters are not suits off the rack, they tailor-make them to you. What's very exciting is it is a very positive give and take. It's a nice dance, as it were." [...] Fahey was not given an overarching overview of his character, nor were any of the other new freighter folk, which he found exciting, creating a level of intrigue amongst the cast and crew as well as fans. [...] Prior to arrival on the island, Lapidus was described by Naomi as a drunk. Entertainment Weeklys Kristin Dos Santos deemed Lapidus the most laid back of the four new characters, though Fahey commented that [...] "It might be because he's just rolled around a few more places a little longer than the others", agreeing with Dos Santos' assessment that Lapidus was [...] "a little nomadic". Lindelof and Cuse have said that Frank [...] "never takes anything at face value [...] a true conspiracy nut [...] has probably seen every episode of The X-Files, [...] pay off for him".|$|E
