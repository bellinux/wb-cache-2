25|$|An <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> or evoked {{response}} is an electrical potential recorded from {{the nervous system}} of a human or other animal following presentation of a stimulus, as distinct from spontaneous potentials as detected by electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), or other electrophysiologic recording method. Such potentials are useful for electrodiagnosis and monitoring.|$|E
25|$|The sweep {{technique}} is a hybrid frequency domain/time domain technique. A plot of, for example, response amplitude versus the check {{size of a}} stimulus checkerboard pattern plot can be obtained in 10 seconds, far faster than when time-domain averaging is used to record an <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> for each of several check sizes.|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{neurophysiology}} {{is concerned}} with testing the physiology or function of the central and peripheral aspects of the nervous system. These kinds of tests {{can be divided into}} recordings of: (1) spontaneous or continuously running electrical activity, or (2) stimulus evoked responses. Subspecialties include electroencephalography, electromyography, <b>evoked</b> <b>potential,</b> nerve conduction study and polysomnography. Sometimes these tests are performed by techs without a medical degree, but the interpretation of these tests is done by a medical professional.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} kinds of <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> in {{widespread}} clinical use: auditory <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials,</b> usually recorded from the scalp but originating at brainstem level; visual <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials,</b> and somatosensory <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials,</b> which are elicited by electrical stimulation of peripheral nerve. See below.|$|R

40|$|The electroencephalogram, and {{somatosensory}} {{and auditory}} <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> were recorded from a patient, who, at necropsy, showed a restricted unilateral thalmic infarct involving predominantly the anterior and lateral thalamus. The electroencephalogram showed distinct monomorphic delta activity and a {{suppression of the}} alpha rhythm {{over the side of}} the lesion.

25|$|<b>Evoked</b> <b>potential</b> amplitudes {{tend to be}} low, {{ranging from}} less than a {{microvolt}} to several microvolts, compared to tens of microvolts for EEG, millivolts for EMG, and often close to a volt for ECG. To resolve these low-amplitude potentials {{against the background of}} ongoing EEG, ECG, EMG, and other biological signals and ambient noise, signal averaging is usually required. The signal is time-locked to the stimulus and most of the noise occurs randomly, allowing the noise to be averaged out with averaging of repeated responses.|$|E
25|$|Domestic horses often cope {{well with}} deafness, and deaf horses may go undiagnosed. Some deaf horses are more skittish than normal, {{while others are}} {{distinctly}} calmer. Deafness in horses can be diagnosed by brainstem auditory <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> (BAEP), which is minimally invasive and requires no sedation and minimal restraint. While blue eyes and a white face are often associated with deafness in other species, apron-faced, non-splash horses are not known to be deaf. Nor {{is the presence of}} one blue, one normal eye indicative of unilateral deafness. The case horse in Hardland's 2006 case study had one blue eye, while the other was parti-colored, but the horse was bilaterally deaf.|$|E
25|$|In 1934, Adrian and Matthew noticed {{potential}} {{changes of}} the occipital EEG can be observed under stimulation of light. Ciganek developed the first nomenclature for occipital EEG components in 1961. During that same year, Hirsch and colleagues recorded a visual <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> (VEP) on the occipital lobe (externally and internally), and they discovered amplitudes recorded along the calcarine fissure were the largest. In 1965, Spehlmann used a checkerboard stimulation to describe human VEPs. An attempt to localize structures in the primary visual pathway was completed by Szikla and colleagues. Halliday and colleagues completed the first clinical investigations using VEP by recording delayed VEPs in a patient with retrobulbar neuritis in 1972. A wide variety of extensive research to improve procedures and theories has been conducted from the 1970s to today and the method has also been described in animals.|$|E
40|$|Multimodality <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> {{and pattern}} electroretinograms (PERGs) were {{performed}} in seventeen patients with histologically defined mitochondrial myopathy (MM).

40|$|A {{method for}} single trial {{estimation}} of <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> is proposed. The method {{is based on}} the subspace regularization approach in which the second order statistics of the set of measurements is used to form the prior information model for <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials.</b> The method was originally developed for the regularization of ill-posed inverse problems and it is especially tolerant to small misspecifications in the assumptions. It is shown in this paper that the approach is well suited to the estimation of <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials.</b> The method has close relationship to Bayesian estimation. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using realistic simulations and the method is then applied to real measurements of <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials.</b> 1 Introduction In the analysis of <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> the fundamental problem is to extract information about the potential from measurements that contain also on-going background EEG.

25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of neurosarcoidosis often is difficult. Definitive diagnosis {{can only be}} made by biopsy (surgically removing a tissue sample). Because of {{the risks associated with}} brain biopsies, they are avoided as much as possible. Other investigations that may be performed in any of the symptoms mentioned above are computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, lumbar puncture, electroencephalography (EEG) and <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> (EP) studies. If the {{diagnosis of}} sarcoidosis is suspected, typical X-ray or CT appearances of the chest may make the diagnosis more likely; elevations in angiotensin-converting enzyme and calcium in the blood, too, make sarcoidosis more likely. In the past, the Kveim test was used to diagnose sarcoidosis. This now obsolete test had a high (85%) sensitivity, but required spleen tissue of a known sarcoidosis patient, an extract of which was injected into the skin of a suspected case.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{report the}} results of a study to record {{vestibular}} <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> (VsEPs) of cortical origin produced by impulsive acceleration (IA). In a sample of 12 healthy participants, <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> recorded by 70 channel electroencephalography were obtained by IA stimulation at the nasion and compared with <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> from the same stimulus applied to the forefingers. The nasion stimulation gave rise to a series of positive and negative deflections in the latency range of 26 – 72 ms, which were dependent on the polarity of the applied IA. In contrast, <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> from the fingers were characterised by a single N 50 /P 50 deflection at about 50 ms and were polarity invariant. Source analysis confirmed that the finger <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> were somatosensory in origin, i. e. were somatosensory <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials,</b> and suggested that the nasion <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> plausibly included vestibular midline and frontal sources, as well as contributions from the eyes, and thus were likely VsEPs. These results show considerable promise as a new method for assessment of the central vestibular system by means of VsEPs produced by IA applied to the head...|$|R

2500|$|An <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> is the {{electrical}} {{response of the}} brain to a sensory stimulus. Regan constructed an analogue Fourier series analyzer to record harmonics of the <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> to flickering (sinusoidally modulated) light. Rather than integrating the sine and cosine products, Regan fed the signals to a two-pen recorder via lowpass filters. [...] This allowed him {{to demonstrate that the}} brain attained a steady-state regime in which the amplitude and phase of the harmonics (frequency components) of the response were approximately constant over time. By analogy with the steady-state response of a resonant circuit that follows the initial transient response he defined an idealized steady-state <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> (SSEP) as a form of response to repetitive sensory stimulation in which the constituent frequency components of the response remain constant with time in both amplitude and phase. [...] Although this definition implies a series of identical temporal waveforms, it is more helpful to define the SSEP in terms of the frequency components that are an alternative description of the time-domain waveform, because different frequency components can have quite different properties. [...] For example, the properties of the high-frequency flicker SSEP (whose peak amplitude is near 40–50Hz) correspond to the properties of the subsequently discovered magnocellular neurons in the retina of the macaque monkey, while the properties of the medium-frequency flicker SSEP ( [...] whose amplitude peak is near 15–20Hz) correspond to the properties of parvocellular neurons. Since a SSEP can be completely described in terms of the amplitude and phase of each frequency component it can be quantified more unequivocally than an averaged transient <b>evoked</b> <b>potential.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Because {{of the low}} {{amplitude}} of the signal once it reaches the patient's scalp and the relatively high amount of electrical noise caused by background EEG, scalp muscle EMG or electrical devices in the room, the signal must be averaged. [...] The use of averaging improves the signal-to-noise ratio. [...] Typically, in the operating room, over 100 and up to 1,000 averages must be used to adequately resolve the <b>evoked</b> <b>potential.</b>|$|E
