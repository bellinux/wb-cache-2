5|$|As the Bonneville <b>Floods</b> rushed {{down the}} Snake River, the Missoula <b>Floods</b> {{occurred}} in the same period, but farther north. The Missoula <b>Floods,</b> which took place more than 40 times in the time span from 15,000 to 13,000 years ago, were caused by Glacial Lake Missoula on the Clark Fork repeatedly being impounded by ice dams then breaking through, with the lake's water rushing over much of eastern Washington in massive surges far larger than the Lake Bonneville Flood. These <b>floods</b> pooled behind the Cascade Range into enormous lakes and spilled over the northern drainage divide of the Snake River watershed, carving deep canyons through the Palouse Hills.

Since the interests on the urban <b>flood</b> mitigation is increased, many structural <b>flood</b> measures has been constructed. If a city has many structural <b>flood</b> measures, the city is considered as the <b>flood</b> safe city. In this study, inherent <b>flood</b> vulnerability is pro-posed using <b>Flood</b> Protection Capacity and Damage(PCD) matrix with the <b>flood</b> damage cost and constructed structural <b>flood</b> mit-igation measures.

40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{expected}} to result in more frequent occurrences of extreme <b>flood</b> events, such as flash <b>flooding</b> and large scale river <b>flooding.</b> Therefore, {{there is a need}} for accurate <b>flood</b> risk assessment schemes in areas prone to extreme <b>flooding.</b> This research study investigates what <b>flood</b> risk assessment tools and procedures should be used for <b>flood</b> risk assessment in areas where the emergence of extreme <b>flood</b> events is possible. The first objective was to determine what type of <b>flood</b> inundation models should be used for predicting the <b>flood</b> elevations, velocities and inundation extent for extreme <b>flood</b> events. Therefore, there different <b>flood</b> inundation model structures were used to model a well-documented extreme <b>flood</b> event. The obtained results suggest that it is necessary to incorporate shock-capturing algorithms in the solution procedure when modelling extreme <b>flood</b> events, since these algorithms prevent the formation of spurious oscillations and provide a more realistic simulation of the <b>flood</b> levels. The second objective was to investigate the appropriateness of the “simplification strategy” (i. e. improving simulation results by increasing roughness parameter) when used as a <b>flood</b> risk assessment modelling tool for areas susceptible to extreme <b>flooding.</b> The obtained results suggest that applying such strategies can lead to significantly erroneous predictions of the peak water levels and the inundation extent, and thus to inadequate <b>flood</b> protection design.
