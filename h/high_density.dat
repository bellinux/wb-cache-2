40|$|Australian {{cities are}} facing a number of challenges, {{including}} a significant growth in population, a growing housing affordability crisis, a greater concern for environmental issues (such as climate change), and shortfalls in transport and other urban infrastructure. In response to these challenges the promotion of a <b>higher</b> <b>density</b> built form has come to represent an urban planning orthodoxy promoted via metropolitan strategies across the country. Despite {{the dominance of the}} <b>higher</b> <b>density</b> ideal within policy rhetoric, its virtues remain the subject of significant debate. To date this debate has been played out in academic and policy circles, with limited recognition of the knowledge and perceptions of such policies held by the general public. Debate around public perceptions of <b>higher</b> <b>density</b> housing has been constrained within the not-in-my-backyard (NIMBY) discourse which works to position public opposition to <b>higher</b> <b>density</b> housing as either an illegitimate and selfish form of localised protest or a valid example of urban citizenship and democracy. This paper takes a step back from these localised debates around the value of <b>higher</b> <b>density</b> housing to explore public opinions of <b>higher</b> <b>density</b> housing at the metropolitan and suburb scales. Drawing on a survey administered across the Sydney metropolitan area this paper explores {{the extent to which the}} public is aware of policies at state and local levels which promote <b>higher</b> <b>density</b> development, the extent to which the public supports some of the underlying principles of <b>higher</b> <b>density</b> housing (such as sustainability, affordability and reduced urban sprawl) and the impact of <b>higher</b> <b>density</b> developments on their suburb. In doing so, the paper develops a typology of support/resistance for <b>higher</b> <b>density</b> housing and associated planning objectives/tools. 12 page(s...|$|R

5|$|Various {{morphological}} {{features of}} galaxies can affect {{their potential for}} habitability. Spiral arms, for example, are the location of star formation, but they contain numerous giant molecular clouds and a <b>high</b> <b>density</b> of stars that can perturb a star's Oort cloud, sending avalanches of comets and asteroids toward any planets further in. In addition, the <b>high</b> <b>density</b> of stars and rate of massive star formation can expose any stars orbiting within the spiral arms for too long to supernova explosions, reducing their prospects for the survival and development of life. Considering these factors, the Sun is advantageously placed within the galaxy because, {{in addition to being}} outside a spiral arm, it orbits near the corotation radius, maximizing the interval between spiral-arm crossings.|$|E

5|$|Depleted uranium is {{also used}} as a {{shielding}} material in some containers used to store and transport radioactive materials. While the metal itself is radioactive, its <b>high</b> <b>density</b> makes it more effective than lead in halting radiation from strong sources such as radium. Other uses of depleted uranium include counterweights for aircraft control surfaces, as ballast for missile re-entry vehicles and as a shielding material. Due to its <b>high</b> <b>density,</b> this material is found in inertial guidance systems and in gyroscopic compasses. Depleted uranium is preferred over similarly dense metals due to its ability to be easily machined and cast {{as well as its}} relatively low cost. The main risk of exposure to depleted uranium is chemical poisoning by uranium oxide rather than radioactivity (uranium being only a weak alpha emitter).|$|E
5|$|Estimates put {{the average}} energy {{density of the}} Universe at the {{equivalent}} of 5.9 protons per cubic meter, including dark energy, dark matter, and baryonic matter (ordinary matter composed of atoms). The atoms account for only 4.6% of the total energy density, or a density of one proton per four cubic meters. The density of the Universe, however, is clearly not uniform; it ranges from relatively <b>high</b> <b>density</b> in galaxies—including very <b>high</b> <b>density</b> in structures within galaxies, such as planets, stars, and black holes—to conditions in vast voids that have much lower density, {{at least in terms}} of visible matter. Unlike the matter and dark matter, the dark energy seems not to be concentrated in galaxies: although dark energy may account for a majority of the mass-energy in the Universe, dark energy's influence is 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the influence of gravity from matter and dark matter within the Milky Way.|$|E

Although {{environmental and economic}} advantages of densification have been empirically supported, the relation between <b>higher</b> <b>density</b> environments and social sustainability has been more contentious. Concerns have been raised regarding the social outcomes of high-density urban contexts; however, these connections have neither been well explored nor understood. Using the city of Amsterdam, considered a case of high-quality compact city form, our study looks at how specific neighbourhood built form relates to key measures of sustainability of community. Despite previous concerns regarding the effects of density, the study reveals that <b>higher</b> <b>densities</b> have no significant impact on local social capital, sense of community or resident satisfaction. Rather, other built-form measures such as scale, existence of local stores, degree of automobile dominance and construction period were of greater importance. The study of high-quality urban environments in Amsterdam challenges notions that <b>higher</b> <b>densities</b> are detrimental to social and community experience and proposes that the specific urban form of <b>higher</b> <b>density</b> neighbourhoods is of greater importance than absolute density...|$|R

5|$|The {{flowers of}} B.sessilis {{have a number}} of adaptations that serve to {{encourage}} outcrossing. Firstly, they are protandrous: a flower's pollen is released around 72 hours before it becomes itself receptive to pollen, by which time around half of its pollen has lost its viability. Secondly, the period of maximum nectar production closely matches the period during which the flower is sexually active, so honeyeaters are enticed to visit at the most opportune time for pollination. This has proven an effective strategy: almost all pollen is removed within two to three hours of presentation. In addition, honeyeaters tend to move between inflorescences on different plants, rather than between inflorescences on the same plant, at least in <b>high</b> <b>density</b> sites. These factors combine to make it fairly unusual for a flower to be fertilised by its own pollen. When self-fertilisation does occur, whether autogamous or geitonogamous, the resulting seed is almost always aborted, and the species ultimately achieves an outcrossing rate of nearly 100%, at least in <b>high</b> <b>density</b> sites. Limited data for low-density sites, where honeyeaters move from plant to plant less frequently, suggest more of a mixed-mating system.|$|E
