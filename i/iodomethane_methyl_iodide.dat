40|$|<b>Methyl</b> <b>iodide</b> is an {{atmospheric}} {{trace gas}} {{and a major}} source of of atmospheric iodine. The ocaens are the main source of <b>methyl</b> <b>iodide</b> to the atmosphere, but the production pathways of <b>methyl</b> <b>iodide</b> in the ocean are poorly understood. In this thesis the surface seawater concentration of <b>methyl</b> <b>iodide</b> was measured together with air concentrations and the sea-air flux calculated from these measurements. The resulting net flux to the atmosphere was 22 nmol per square meter per day, giving a global oceanic source of 2. 9 Gmol <b>methyl</b> <b>iodide</b> per year. Incubation experiments were done in the tropical Atlantic to get more information about the production pathway of <b>methyl</b> <b>iodide</b> in the ocean. The observed production rates were not influenced by filtering or poisoning of the seawater prior to the incubation, but strongly dependent on light. This points to a photochemical production parthway of <b>methyl</b> <b>iodide.</b> Simple model calculations show that the observed photochemical production may be the dominant source of <b>methyl</b> <b>iodide</b> in the ocean...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} that manganese oxides can initiate {{the formation of}} <b>methyl</b> <b>iodide,</b> a volatile compound that participates to the input of iodine into the atmosphere. The formation of <b>methyl</b> <b>iodide</b> was investigated using a natural manganese oxide in batch experiments for different conditions and concentrations of iodide, natural organic matter(NOM) and manganese oxide. <b>Methyl</b> <b>iodide</b> was formed at concentrations ≤ 1 μg L- 1 for initial iodide concentrations ranging from 0. 8 to 38. 0 mg L- 1. The production of <b>methyl</b> <b>iodide</b> increased with increasing initial concentrations of iodide ion and Mn sand and when pH decreased from 7 to 5. The hydrophilic NOM isolate exhibited the lowest yield of <b>methyl</b> <b>iodide</b> whereas hydrophobic NOM isolates such as Suwannee River HPOA fraction produced the highest concentration of <b>methyl</b> <b>iodide.</b> The formation of <b>methyl</b> <b>iodide</b> could take place through the oxidation of NOM on manganese dioxide {{in the presence of}} iodide. However, the implication of elemental iodine cannot be excluded at acidic pH. Manganese oxides can then participate with ferric oxides to the formation of <b>methyl</b> <b>iodide</b> in soils and sediments.

40|$|An {{experimental}} and modeling study {{was carried out}} to assess the impacts of <b>methyl</b> <b>iodide</b> on ground-level ozone formation compared to other chemicals that are emitted into the atmosphere. The experiments consisted of environmental chamber irradiations of <b>methyl</b> <b>iodide</b> and NOx with and without added CO, <b>methyl</b> <b>iodide</b> and O 3 with CO, and incremental reactivity environmental chamber experiments {{to determine the effect}} of adding <b>methyl</b> <b>iodide</b> to irradiations of reactive organic gas (ROG) surrogate - NOx mixtures representing ambient conditions. The results were modeled using the SAPRC- 07 mechanism with the reactions of <b>methyl</b> <b>iodide</b> and iodine species added.

This mechanism was then used to calculate the atmospheric impact of <b>methyl</b> <b>iodide</b> in the box model scenarios to derive the Maximum Incremental Reactivity (MIR) and other reactivity scales. <b>Methyl</b> <b>iodide</b> was calculated to inhibit ozone under all conditions except those with very high NOx levels, where its impact is comparable to that for ethane.

40|$|Abstract: Production and {{importation}} of methyl bromide {{is scheduled to}} be banned by 2001. <b>Methyl</b> <b>iodide</b> was evaluated as a possible replacement soil fumigant. The e†ects of soil moisture, temperature, soil texture and fumigation time on the efficacy of <b>methyl</b> <b>iodide</b> for the control of two common weeds, Abutilon theophrasti and L olium multiÑorum, were characterized and compared with those of methyl bromide. The optimal soil moisture for <b>methyl</b> <b>iodide</b> to kill both weed species in sandy soils was 14 % water content (w/w). Greater efficacy was obtained when the temperature during fumigation was above 20 ¡C. Com-pared to methyl bromide, the efficacy of <b>methyl</b> <b>iodide</b> was more consistent in di†erent soils. Time to 100 % mortality of weeds was 24 h for <b>methyl</b> <b>iodide</b> fumigation and 36 h for methyl bromide when 200 kM of fumigant was used. On a molar basis <b>methyl</b> <b>iodide</b> was consistently more e†ective than methyl bromide across the range of environmental factors tested.

For puff releases of <b>methyl</b> <b>iodide,</b> gas phase removal half-times varied from seven minutes to 125 minutes, depending on the temperature, spray flow rate, and hydrazine concentration.

40|$|<b>Methyl</b> <b>iodide</b> is a {{well-known}} volatile halogenated organic compound {{that contributes to the}} iodine content in the troposphere, potentially resulting in damage to the ozone layer. Most <b>methyl</b> <b>iodide</b> sources derive from biological activity in oceans and soils with very few abiotic mechanisms proposed in the literature. In this study we report that synthetic manganese oxide (birnessite δ-MnO 2) can catalyze the formation of <b>methyl</b> <b>iodide</b> in the presence of natural organic matter (NOM) and <b>iodide.</b> <b>Methyl</b> <b>iodide</b> formation was only observed at acidic pH (4 – 5) where iodide is oxidized to iodine and NOM is adsorbed on δ-MnO 2. The effect of δ-MnO 2, iodide and NOM concentrations, nature of NOM and ionic strength was investigated. High concentrations of <b>methyl</b> <b>iodide</b> were formed in experiments conducted with the model compound pyruvate.

40|$|The use of <b>methyl</b> <b>iodide</b> as a histochemical {{alkylating agent}} is described. <b>Methyl</b> <b>iodide</b> {{selectively}} esterifles carbohydrate and other carboxyl groups. Sulfate half esters are not af-fected. Phosphate esters are esterffied by <b>methyl</b> <b>iodide,</b> although the latter reaction is more variable; in several tissues nuclear basophiia {{could not be}} abolished. Saponification with barium hydroxide reverses the <b>methyl</b> <b>iodide</b> blockade of basophilia. Sulfhydryl and phenol reactions are prevented by methylation with methyl iodide; amines are alkylated and the usual blockade of acidophilia by acylation or deamination is prevented. Saponification does not reverse the blockade of these latter groups. The periodic acid-Schiff and Sakaguchi reactions are not affected. Marked increases in acidophilia were noted after methylation with <b>methyl</b> <b>iodide.</b> The hypothesis {{that a large number}} of tissue acids and amines are ordinarily prevented from binding basic and acid dyes respectively by intra- or intermolecular salt linkages is set forth.

Most inshore samples had low and variable <b>methyl</b> <b>iodide</b> concentrations in seawater (14. 8 – 57. 7 pM) and in air immediately above the sea (2. 1 – 3. 8 parts per trillion by volume), with a partial tidal influence. A period of elevated <b>methyl</b> <b>iodide</b> {{concentration in}} the water (144. 5 pM) and in air above the sea surface (5. 5 pptv) was immediately followed by a measurement of new particles at the Cape Grim BAPS.

Elevated levels of atmospheric <b>methyl</b> <b>iodide</b> were not detected at the station (adjacent to the site but on top of a 94 -m cliff) at the same time, which suggests the effect was localised above the sea surface.

Both campaigns were periodically impacted by dust, advected from Africa in trade winds. Unexpectedly, during these dust events, <b>methyl</b> <b>iodide</b> mixing ratios were observed to be high relative to other times. Backward calculations with the particle dispersion model FLEXPART show the origin of the dust storms as Mauritania and southern Algeria for the ground and ship based campaigns, respectively. The dust laden air travelled from its source above the marine boundary layer to the measurement region. Based on the field data correlations and the simulations, we suggest that dust stimulated emission of <b>methyl</b> <b>iodide</b> has occurred. To test this hypothesis, dust samples were collected from the identified source regions and added to filtered Atlantic seawater. This rapidly produced <b>methyl</b> <b>iodide.</b> Further tests established that the addition of iodide increased the yield and iodide with H 2 O 2 was greater still. This was found for both sterilised and non-sterilised samples. We conclude that there is an abiotic <b>methyl</b> <b>iodide</b> production mechanism that can occur via substitution, analogous to those in soil, rather than radical recombination.
