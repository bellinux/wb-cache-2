5|$|The broad-billed parrot's {{head was}} large in {{proportion}} to its body, {{and there was a}} distinct crest of feathers {{on the front of the}} head. The bird had a very large beak, comparable in size to that of the <b>hyacinth</b> <b>macaw,</b> which would have enabled it to crack hard seeds. Subfossil bones indicate that the species exhibited greater sexual dimorphism in overall size and head size than any living parrot. The exact colouration is unknown, but a contemporary description indicates that it had multiple colours, including a blue head, and perhaps a red body and beak. It is believed to have been a weak flier, but not flightless.|$|E
5|$|Species {{that are}} morphologically {{similar to the}} broad-billed parrot, such as the <b>hyacinth</b> <b>macaw</b> and the palm cockatoo, may provide insight into its ecology. Anodorhynchus macaws, which are {{habitual}} ground dwellers, eat very hard palm nuts. Carlos Yamashita has suggested that these macaws once depended on now-extinct South American megafauna to eat fruits and excrete the seeds, and that they later relied on domesticated cattle to do this. Similarly, in Australasia the palm cockatoo feeds on undigested seeds from cassowary droppings. Yamashita suggested that the abundant Cylindraspis tortoises and dodos performed the same function on Mauritius, and that the broad-billed parrot, with its macaw-like beak, depended on them to obtain cleaned seeds. Many types of palms and palm-like plants on Mauritius produce hard seeds that the broad-billed parrot may have eaten, including Latania loddigesii, Mimusops maxima, Sideroxylon grandiflorum, Diospyros egrettorium, and Pandanus utilis.|$|E
25|$|Hyacinth macaws (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus) {{have been}} {{repeatedly}} observed to use tools when breaking open nuts, for example, {{pieces of wood}} {{being used as a}} wedge. Several birds have wrapped a piece of leaf around a nut to hold it in place. This behaviour is also shown by palm cockatoos (Probosciger aterrimus). It seems that the <b>hyacinth</b> <b>macaw</b> has an innate tendency to use tools during manipulation of nuts, as naïve juveniles tried out a variety of objects in combination with nuts.|$|E

25|$|The Pantanal covers {{at least}} 140,000 square {{kilometers}} of land, over {{four times the}} size of the Florida Everglades in North America. There are an estimated 700 species of birds, including spoonbills, and 26 species of parrots, including the endangered <b>hyacinth</b> <b>macaw.</b> The Pantanal is also home to the capybara, the world's largest rodent. Fish thrive in this wetland environment (over 260 species have been noted). Illegal poaching, deforestation, overfishing, pollution from human sewage, agricultural pesticides, and metal pollutants are taking an increasing environmental toll on the area.|$|E
500|$|The kakapo is a large, rotund parrot; {{the adult}} can measure from [...] in length, and weight {{can vary from}} [...] at maturity. Males are larger than females. Twenty-eight males were found to average [...] in one study, and 39 males were found to average [...] in another. In the same studies, 28 females were found to average [...] and 18 females were found to average respectively. Kakapos are the {{heaviest}} living species of parrot and on average weigh about [...] more than the largest flying parrot, the <b>hyacinth</b> <b>macaw.</b> The kakapo cannot fly, having relatively short wings for its size and lacking the keel on the sternum (breastbone), where the flight muscles of other birds attach. It uses its wings for balance and to break its fall when leaping from trees. Unlike many other land birds, the kakapo can accumulate large amounts of body fat.|$|E
500|$|On {{the basis}} of radiographs, D. T. Holyoak claimed that the {{mandible}} of the broad-billed parrot was weakly constructed and suggested {{that it would have}} fed on soft fruits rather than hard seeds. As evidence, he pointed out that the internal trabeculae were widely spaced, that the upper bill was broad whereas the palatines were narrow, and the fact that no preserved upper rostrum had been discovered, which he attributed to its delicateness. G. A. Smith, however, pointed out that the four genera Holyoak used as examples of [...] "strong jawed" [...] parrots based on radiographs, Cyanorhamphus, Melopsittacus, Neophema and Psephotus, actually have weak jaws in life, and that the morphologies cited by Holyoak do not indicate strength. Hume has since pointed out that the mandible morphology of the broad-billed parrot is comparable to that of the largest living parrot, the <b>hyacinth</b> <b>macaw,</b> which cracks open palm nuts with ease. It is therefore probable that the broad-billed parrot fed in the same manner.|$|E

As well as performing for Children in Need, the band launched, on 25 September 2000, a new television series called S Club 7 Go Wild!, which saw each band member support an endangered species. Teaming up with the World Wildlife Fund, each member travelled to different destinations worldwide with a hope to raise awareness about the seven endangered creatures, including the Siberian tiger and the <b>hyacinth</b> <b>macaw.</b> In October 2000, they launched the annual Poppy Appeal Campaign with Dame Thora Hird and supported Woolworth's Kids First Campaign throughout 1999 and 2000. The group also recorded vocals for [...] "It's Only Rock 'N' Roll", which raised money for Children's Promise, an alliance of seven children's charities: Barnardo's, Children in Need, ChildLine, The Children's Society, Comic Relief, NCH and the NSPCC. A cover of The Rolling Stones song, the group contributed to the vocals alongside many popular artists, including Mary J. Blige, Natalie Imbruglia and the Spice Girls; it entered the UK charts at number-nineteen. Also, during that time they filmed two speciales: [...] "Artistic Differences" [...] and their [...] "Christmas Special".|$|E
500|$|In 1905, the British {{banker and}} {{zoologist}} Walter Rothschild named Anodorhynchus purpurascens, {{based on an}} old description of a deep violet parrot seen on Guadeloupe, found in an 1838 publication by a [...] "Don de Navaret". He interpreted it as an extinct Anodorhynchus macaw due to its entirely blue colouration, and stated that the native Caribs called it [...] "onécouli". Greenway suggested this [...] "mythical macaw" [...] may {{have been based on}} a careless description of the Guadeloupe amazon, or possibly an imported Lear's macaw (Anodorhynchus leari) from South America. He was unable to check the reference given by Rothschild, but suggested {{it may have been a}} publication by the Spanish historian Martín Fernández de Navarrete. In 2000, the English writer Errol Fuller suggested the bird may have been an imported <b>hyacinth</b> <b>macaw</b> (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus). In 2001, Williams and Steadman were also unable to find the reference listed by Rothschild, and concluded that the supposed species required further corroboration. James W. Wiley and Guy M. Kirwan were also unable to find the reference to the violet macaw in 2013, but pointed out an account by the Italian writer Peter Martyr d'Anghiera that described how the Spanish took parrots that were mainly purple from Guadeloupe during the second voyage of Christopher Columbus.|$|E

2500|$|In 1638 Georg Marcgrave was {{the first}} European naturalist to observe and {{describe}} the species; however, it is named for Johann Baptist von Spix, who collected the type specimen in April 1819 in Brazil, but gave it the misnomer Arara hyacinthinus not realizing till later that the name collided with Psittacus hyacinthinus, the name assigned to the <b>hyacinth</b> <b>macaw</b> described by John Lathan in 1790. Spix's mistake was noticed in 1832 by German Professor of Zoology Johann Wagler, who realized that the 1819 specimen was smaller and a different color than the <b>hyacinth</b> <b>macaw</b> and he designated the new species as [...] "Sittace spixii". It wasn't until 1854 that naturalist Prince Charles Bonaparte properly placed it in its own genus, designating the bird Cyanopsitta spixi, based on important morphological differences {{between it and the}} other blue macaws. It was listed as Cyanopsittacus spixi by Italian zoologist Tommaso Salvadori in his 1891 Catalog of the Birds in the British Museum.|$|E

Examples of tool use that have been observed usually involve a chewed leaf or pieces of wood. Macaws often incorporate these items when feeding on harder nuts. Their use allows the nuts the macaws eat to remain in position (prevent slipping) while they gnaw into it. It is not known whether this is learned social behavior or an innate trait, but observation on captive macaws shows that hand-raised macaws exhibit this behavior, as well. Comparisons show that older macaws were able to open seeds more efficiently.|$|R
