40|$|Abstract. Modern {{national}} <b>income</b> <b>accounting</b> {{was designed}} in the early 20 th century {{for the purpose of}} providing improved indicators about the performance of the economy so that government policy makers could better control the economy. The way that performance is measured affects the types of policies used to try to accomplish policy goals. Two attributes of national <b>income</b> <b>accounting</b> are analyzed for their effects on economic policy. First, government production is included in the national <b>income</b> <b>accounts</b> at cost, rather than at market value as private sector output is measured. This biases policy toward a larger public sector. Second, output is measured as a homogeneous dollar amount. This biases policy toward focusing on increasing quantities of inputs and outputs in the production process, rather than on innovation and entrepreneurship, which are the true engines of economic progress. Economic policy could be improved by focusing less on national income as an indicator of policy, and more on the underlying processes that foster economic progress. Key Words: national <b>income</b> <b>accounting,</b> macroeconomic policy, public finance JEL classification: E 6. The unprecedented worldwide economic progress in the nineteenth century was led by the United States, which began the century as an agrarian economy and ended it as the world’s industrial leader. Nineteenth century economic progress was not without its setbacks, how...|$|R
