On {{the basis of the}} <b>hexyl</b> <b>laurate</b> could be successfully synthesized by lipase within a batch system in our previous report. This study aimed to develop an optimal continuous procedure of lipase-catalyzed <b>hexyl</b> <b>laurate</b> synthesis in a packed-bed bioreactor to investigate the possibility of large-scale production further. The ability of lipase from Rhizomucor miehei (Lipozyme IM- 77) to catalyze the direct-esterification of 1 -hexanol and lauric acid in n-hexane was investigated. Response surface methodology (RSM) and 3 -level- 3 -factor fractional factorial design were employed to evaluate the effects of synthesis parameters, such as reaction temperature (35 - 55 degrees C), mixture flow rate (1. 5 - 4. 5 mL/min) and substrate molar ratio 1 -hexanol to lauric acid (1 : 1 - 1 : 3) on production rate (mu mol/min) of <b>hexyl</b> <b>laurate</b> by direct-esterification. Based on the analysis of ridge max, the optimum synthesis conditions for <b>hexyl</b> <b>laurate</b> were as follows: 45 degrees C of reaction temperature, substrate molar ratio 1 : 2 and reaction flow rate 4. 5 mL/min. The optimum predicted production rate was 435. 6 +/- 0. 9 mu mol/min and the actual value was 437. 6 +/- 0. 4 mu mol/min. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

To conform to the "natural" interests of consumers, the ability of immobilized lipase from Rhizomucor miehei (Lipozyme IM- 77) to catalyze the direct esterification of hexanol and lauric acid by using a solvent-free system was investigated in this study. Response surface methodology (RSM) and four-factor-five-level central composite rotatable design (CCRD) were employed to evaluate the effects of synthesis parameters, such as reaction time (10 - 50 min), temperature (45 - 85 degrees C), lipase amount (10 - 30 mg/volume; 0. 077 - 0. 231 batch acidolysis units of Novo (BAUN), and pH memory (5 - 9), on percentage molar conversion of <b>hexyl</b> <b>laurate</b> by lipase-catalyzed direct esterification. Reaction time, temperature, and enzyme amount had significant effects on percent molar conversion. On the basis of ridge maximum analysis, the optimum synthesis conditions for <b>hexyl</b> <b>laurate</b> were a reaction time of 40. 6 min, a temperature of 58. 2 degrees C, an enzyme amount of 25. 4 mg/volume (0. 196 BAUN), and a pH memory of 5. 9.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Hexyl</b> <b>laurate</b> {{has been}} applied widely in {{cosmetic}} industries and is synthesized by chemical methods with problems of cost, environmental pollution, and by-products. In this study, Lipozyme (R) IM 77 (from Rhizomucor miehei) was used to catalyze the direct-esterification of hexanol and lauric acid in a solvent-free system by utilizing a continuous packed-bed reactor, wherein the aforementioned difficulties could be overcome. Response surface methodology (RSM) and three-level-three-factor Box-Behnken design were employed to evaluate the effects of synthesis parameters, such as reaction temperature (45 - 65 degrees C), mixture flow rate (0. 25 - 0. 75 mL min(- 1)) and concentration of lauric acid (1100 - 300 mmol L(- 1)) on the production rate (mu mol min(- 1)) of <b>hexyl</b> <b>laurate</b> by direct esterification. RESULTS: The production rate was affected significantly by the mixture flow rate and lauric acid concentration. On the basis of ridge-max analysis, the optimum synthesis conditions for <b>hexyl</b> <b>laurate</b> were as follows: 81. 58 +/- 1. 76 mu mol min(- 1) at 55 degrees C, 0. 5 mL min(- 1) flow rate and 0. 3 mol L(- 1) lauric acid. CONCLUSION: The lipase-catalyzed synthesis of <b>hexyl</b> <b>laurate</b> by Lipozyme (R) IM- 77 in a continuous packed-bed bioreactor and solvent-free system was successfully developed; optimization of the reaction parameters was obtained by Box-Behnken design and RSM.
