500|$|Batman subdues the Joker {{and tells}} him that Gordon survived the Joker's torments, and {{suggests}} that the Joker is alone in his madness. He attempts {{to reach out to}} the Joker and offers to help him recover in order to end their everlasting war, which Batman fears may one day result in a fight to the death. The Joker declines, saying it is too late..."far too late". He then says that this situation reminds him of a joke about two inmates in a lunatic asylum who try to escape. One inmate jumps across a narrow gap between the asylum and the adjoining building, but the other is afraid he will fall. The first inmate offers to shine his flashlight across the gap so the other can walk across it, but the second inmate replies, [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am, crazy? You'd turn it off when I was halfway across!" [...] Batman chuckles at the punch line, and the two old foes laugh as the police arrive.|$|E
500|$|On May 1, 18 {{days after}} the episode's {{original}} airdate, a failed car bomb attempt was discovered by the New York City Police Department near the eastern corner of 1 Astor Plaza in New York City, on West 45 Street, on a side street near {{the location of the}} world headquarters of Viacom, Comedy Central's parent company. Some news outlets reported that police are looking into a possible link between the attempted bombing and the warnings of violence against Trey Parker and Matt Stone, although no such link has yet been established. Such speculation was also fueled by statements from U.S. Congressman Peter T. King, who described as one possible motive [...] "the whole issue with 'South Park,' which Islamic terrorists were threatening to have retribution for." [...] However, King stressed the theory was [...] "one possibility out of a hundred". Revolution Muslim has denied any involvement with the incident. Younus Abdullah Muhammed, who runs the group's website, was in Times Square at the time speaking out against President Barack Obama with a loudspeaker. But he said of the failed car bomb, [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> <b>I</b> commanded somebody to blow up a building in the middle of Times Square? [...] It {{had nothing to do with}} the 'South Park' controversy. It was not an attack targeting Viacom." [...] NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly said of the theory, [...] "We certainly wouldn't rule that out." [...] However, media reports indicated Faisal Shahzad, the suspect arrested in connection with the attempted bombing, had trained for months prior to the first broadcast of [...] "200." ...|$|E

2500|$|When police {{displayed}} this warrant to Rose on 24 February, {{she turned}} pale, before becoming hysterical and shouting {{over her shoulder}} to her eldest son, Stephen, [...] "Get Fred!" [...] Rose became contradictory in her informal questioning as to the circumstances surrounding Heather's disappearance. When reminded of these contradictions, she became uptight and abusive, shouting at the officers: [...] "I can't fucking remember! It's a bloody long time ago! What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am? A bloody computer?" ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of the Sylvania 300 at New Hampshire Motor Speedway, Busch's team was delayed in rolling their car to pit road until after the National anthem. During pre-race car {{inspections}} NASCAR had an issue with the rear-end housing being outside of its allowable tolerances. Jamie Little, walking with Busch, asked if he was okay with her asking a question. Busch responded, [...] "Why the fuck <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> would be okay, I gotta go get in my car. NASCAR told me I gotta get in my car".|$|E
2500|$|On the {{broadcast}} of January 8, 1950, journalist Drew Pearson {{was the subject}} of a joke gone wrong. Announcer Don Wilson was supposed to say he heard that Jack bought a new suit on Drew Pearson, but said the name wrong; Don said [...] "Drear Pewson". Later in the show, comedic actor Frank Nelson was asked by Benny if he was the doorman. Changing his original response at the suggestion of the writers, Nelson said, [...] "Well, who <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am, Drear Pewson?" [...] The audience laughed for almost 30 seconds.|$|E

2500|$|La Païva reigned {{for years}} as a popular hostess known for her lavish open houses, teas, and dinners and salon frequented largely by {{well-known}} male writers, such as Gustave Flaubert, Émile Zola, Paul de Saint-Victor, Arsène Houssaye, and others, including the painter Eugène Delacroix. The bill of fare was so lavish that she overheard two guests discussing how much she could possibly be worth. One posited 10 million francs a year, at which comment La Païva scoffed, [...] "You must be mad. Ten millions? Why that would barely yield an income of 500,000 francs. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> could give you peaches and ripe grapes in January on 500,000 francs a year? Why my table alone costs me more than that!" ...|$|E
2500|$|On 2 November 2011, Terry {{was placed}} under police {{investigation}} following an allegation of racist abuse made at Anton Ferdinand during a match versus Queens Park Rangers.

[...] In response to the video footage, Terry claimed {{that he was actually}} asking Ferdinand, [...] "Oi, Anton, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> called you a black cunt?" [...] On 25 November 2011, Terry was interviewed under caution by the police. On 21 December 2011, he was charged with using racist language by the Crown Prosecution Service. On 3 February 2012, The Football Association stripped Terry of his England captaincy for the second time, stating that Terry would not captain the national team until the racial abuse allegations against him were resolved.|$|E
2500|$|Although Nietzsche has famously been {{misrepresented}} as a predecessor to Nazism, {{he criticized}} anti-Semitism, pan-Germanism and, {{to a lesser}} extent, nationalism. Thus, he broke with his editor in 1886 because of his opposition to his editor's anti-Semitic stances, and his rupture with Richard Wagner, expressed in The Case of Wagner and Nietzsche Contra Wagner, both of which he wrote in 1888, {{had much to do}} with Wagner's endorsement of pan-Germanism and anti-Semitism [...] and also of his rallying to Christianity. In a March 29, 1887 letter to Theodor Fritsch, Nietzsche mocked anti-Semites, Fritsch, Eugen Dühring, Wagner, Ebrard, Wahrmund, and the leading advocate of pan-Germanism, Paul de Lagarde, who would become, along with Wagner and Houston Chamberlain, the main official influences of Nazism. This 1887 letter to Fritsch ended by: [...] "-- And finally, how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> feel when the name Zarathustra is mouthed by anti-Semites? ..." ...|$|E

2500|$|Later, after Zhong Hui {{secretly}} accused Deng Ai {{of plotting}} a rebellion, Sima Zhao wanted {{to lead his}} forces to station at Chang'an. Shao Ti told Sima Zhao {{that there was no}} need for him to go to Chang'an because Zhong Hui was capable of arresting Deng Ai on his own since he had five to six times more troops than Deng Ai. Sima Zhao replied, [...] "Have you forgotten what you said previously? Why are you asking me not to go (to Chang'an) now? Please keep secret what we spoke about. I treat people with trust and respect. As long as they remain loyal to me, I will not doubt them. Jia Chong recently asked me, 'Are you suspicious of Zhong Hui?' I replied, 'If I send you on a mission today, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> doubt you?' He could not respond to my reply. Everything will be settled when I arrive in Chang'an." [...] By the time Sima Zhao reached Chang'an, Zhong Hui had already been killed in the mutiny, just as Sima Zhao foresaw.|$|E
2500|$|The former cabinet-maker did not {{restrict}} {{himself to}} the income from the Lord Mayor of London. In fact, his famous words: [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> bought my place for, but {{to make the most}} of it?" [...] used to justify his crimes, describe the readiness with which he embraced his [...] "duties". Not being the first to use the position as a form of legal theft, he regularised the practice. He had probably acted as a middleman or receiver between thieves and victims several years before taking the post, otherwise it would be difficult to explain his familiarity with London's underworld. He made full use of his authority as a leverage to build or extend his thief-taking business and stayed as a middleman in it. Hitchen managed to regulate about 2000 thieves and organise for them to steal and fence the stolen merchandise through him, a practice pickpockets would find more profitable or less dangerous than going to a pawnbroker, since most desperate victims of the theft were ready to pay a fee negotiated by the [...] "finder" [...] (Hitchen) for the return of their stolen items.|$|E
2500|$|Lynn's next album, Fist City, was {{released}} in 1968. The title track became Lynn's second No.1 hit, as a single earlier that year, and the other single from the album, [...] "What Kind of a Girl (<b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Think</b> <b>I</b> Am)", peaked within the Top 10. In 1968, her next studio album, Your Squaw Is on the Warpath, spawned two Top 5 Country hits: the title track and [...] "You've Just Stepped In (From Stepping Out on Me)". In 1969, her next single, [...] "Woman of the World (Leave My World Alone)", was Lynn's third chart-topper, followed by a subsequent Top 10, [...] "To Make a Man (Feel Like a Man)". She was reportedly once inspired to write a song about a real woman she suspected was flirting with her husband. The song, [...] "You Ain't Woman Enough (To Take My Man)", was an instant hit {{and became one of}} Lynn's all-time most popular. Her career continued to be successful into the 1970s, especially following the success of her hit [...] "Coal Miner's Daughter", which peaked at No.1 on the Billboard Country Chart in 1970, and the album has sold over 5 million copies worldwide. [...] "Coal Miner's Daughter" [...] tells the story of Lynn's life growing up in rural Butcher Hollow, Kentucky. The song became her first single to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at No. 83. She had a series of singles that charted low on the Hot 100 between 1970 and 1975. The song [...] "Coal Miner's Daughter" [...] later served as the impetus for the best-selling autobiography (1976) and the Oscar-winning biopic, both of which share the song's title.|$|E
