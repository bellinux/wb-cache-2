[...] In one episode, as she delivers her closing arguments to a jury, she says [...] "There's a very old expression in China," [...] and then begins to speak in Chinese. In the subtitles we see her saying, [...] "It really doesn't matter what I say here, because none of you speak Chinese. But you can see from my sad face I'm sympathetic. You hear from my tone it's appropriate to <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> As I drop to a faint whisper (which she does), you'll feel the sorrow yourself. I'm going to finish now, pretend to cry", which she does as she walks off.|$|E
500|$|Mac {{is portrayed}} as near death at the {{beginning}} of the film, having woken up in a drunken stupor in a boundless, empty flatland with nothing in his possession, a shot that scholar Roy M. Anker said [...] "pointedly reflects the condition of his own soul". The dialogue in other scenes suggests the threat of mortality, including a moment when Mac has trouble singing due to his bad voice and says, [...] "Don't <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> Rosa Lee, I'm not dead yet." [...] In several lasting shots, the vast sky dwarfs Mac, Rosa Lee and Sonny, starkly symbolizing their isolation, as well as the fragility of human existence. The fact that Mac sustains his newfound life with Rosa Lee and Sonny after his daughter's death, rather than reverting to his old pattern of alcoholism and abuse, is consistent with a recurring theme in Foote's works of characters overcoming tragedy and finding in it an opportunity for growth and maturation.|$|E
2500|$|Lawyers {{convinced}} LAPD {{to allow}} Simpson to turn himself in at 11a.m. on June 17, 1994, although the double murder charge meant that no bail {{would be set}} and a first-degree murder conviction {{could result in a}} death penalty. More than 1,000 reporters waited for Simpson at the police station, but he did not arrive. At 2p.m., LAPD issued an all-points bulletin. At 5p.m., Robert Kardashian, a friend of Simpson's and one of his defense lawyers, read a letter by Simpson to the media. In the letter Simpson sent greetings to 24 friends and wrote, [...] "First everyone understand I {{had nothing to do with}} Nicole's murder ... Don't <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> I've had a great life." [...] Some interpreted this as a suicide note; Simpson's mother Eunice collapsed after hearing it, and reporters joined the search for Simpson. Simpson's lawyer Robert Shapiro was present at Kardashian's press conference and said that Simpson's psychiatrists agreed with the suicide note interpretation. Over the television, Shapiro appealed to Simpson to surrender.|$|E

When first encountered she is a sixteen-year-old girl with silver hair and silver eyes who, it transpires, has been sixteen for thirty-five Discworld 'years' (no time passes in Death's Domain). During her encounter with Rincewind (see below), her behaviour is sufficiently flamboyant as to cause him to believe she is [...] "bonkers". When Mort first encountered Ysabell, he was given the impression of [...] "too many chocolates". She also has a fixation for the colour pink.|$|E

50|$|In 1934 Pyotr Astafyev {{returned}} from labour camp and married again. He took Viktor {{to his new}} place, a small forest village Sosnovka, then in 1935 moved the family to Igarka where they settled as spetspereselentsy. Ignored by both his stepmother Taisiya Tcherkasova (who’s by now given birth to her own son, Nikolai) and father, the boy rioted and soon found himself on the street, homeless. In 1937 he was taken in an orphanage and joined the 5th form of its special school which years later he remembered with great affection. Two of the teachers, Rozhdestvensky and Sokolov, noticed artistic and literary abilities in the boy who by this time started to write poetry, and did a lot to encourage him. Years later he remembered: Critics for some reason tend to <b>feel</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> and for the difficult childhood that I had. This vexes me a lot. More than that... Given such a chance, I’d have chosen the very same life, full of things, happiness, victories and defeats. The latter only help {{to see the world}} better, to feel kindness deeper. There would have been just one thing I'd have changed - asked fate to keep mother with me. pause Orphanage, wandering, the boarding school - all this I had to live through in Igarka. But there were other things - books and songs, skiing trips, childhood happiness, first tears of epiphany... It was there {{that for the first time}} I've heard the radio, the gramophone, the brass orchestra... And it was in Igarka that I wrote my first ever short story which my teacher Rozhdestvensky published in our school's self-edited journal. And the newspaper Bolshevik Zapolyarya published my 4-line verse. On 1 May 1941, Astafyev graduated from the school and joined a brickyard as a transport worker. As the Great Patriotic War broke out, he was working in the Kureika station, a manual worker at local village Soviet. In August he left Igarka and joined the newly formed Railway school in Krasnoyarsk which he graduated in June 1942.|$|E
