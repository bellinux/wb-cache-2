5|$|As {{a natural}} force, {{the wind was}} often personified as one or more wind gods or as an {{expression}} of the supernatural in many cultures. Vayu is the Hindu God of Wind. The Greek wind gods include Boreas, Notus, Eurus, and Zephyrus. Aeolus, in varying interpretations the ruler or keeper of the four winds, has also been described as Astraeus, the god of dusk who fathered the four winds with Eos, goddess of dawn. The Ancient Greeks also observed the seasonal change of the winds, as evidenced by the Tower of the Winds in Athens. Venti are the Roman gods of the winds. Fūjin is the Japanese wind god {{and is one of the}} eldest Shinto gods. According to legend, he was present at the creation of the world and <b>first</b> <b>let</b> the winds out of his bag to clear the world of mist. In Norse mythology, Njörðr is the god of the wind. There are also four dvärgar (Norse dwarves), named Norðri, Suðri, Austri and Vestri, and probably the four stags of Yggdrasil, personify the four winds, and parallel the four Greek wind gods. Stribog is the name of the Slavic god of winds, sky and air. He is said to be the ancestor (grandfather) of the winds of the eight directions.|$|E

2500|$|The {{demand for}} houses {{declined}} {{briefly in the}} 1750s and began to increase again in 1759. Additional streets were laid out between Colmore Row and the Great Charles Street Queensway area in the 1760s. The plots in the Great Charles Street area were <b>first</b> <b>let</b> in 1760.

Construction of houses continued up into the area now known as the Jewellery Quarter and it became a wealthy residential area consisting of upmarket Georgian houses.

2500|$|No road {{passed by}} Tower Rock until 1932. The {{route of the}} old Mullan Road served as the only {{automobile}} link between Cascade and Helena. In 1921, the state of Montana and the counties of Cascade and Lewis and Clark jointly proposed building a road on the east bank of the Missouri River between the towns of Hardy and Craig. [...] The route would have avoided Tower Rock. But this project was never acted on. Beginning in 1928, businessmen in Great Falls, Cascade, and Helena began petitioning the state of Montana to build a state highway from Cascade to Wolf Creek through the Missouri River. This project, whose route was {{on the west bank}} of the Missouri and largely paralleled the railroad tracks, was approved. The area was still sparsely settled, and little blasting or digging had to be done as the route went around Tower Rock to the west rather than east. Contracts for the project were <b>first</b> <b>let</b> in 1929, although most construction occurred in 1930 and 1931. The road through the Missouri River canyon was completed in 1932, and all of Highway 91 in Montana opened by 1935. (The Hardy Bridge, located [...] south of Tower Rock, was constructed as part of this project.) The segment from Cascade to Wolf Creek provided some of the most spectacular views of any highway in the state.|$|E
2500|$|As of July 2011, the San Diego Zoo {{is one of}} four zoos in the U.S. {{which have}} giant pandas on display, and is the most {{successful}} in terms of panda reproduction. [...] The first two giant panda cubs in U.S. history to have been born in the U.S. and survive into adulthood, Hua Mei (female, born to Bai Yun and Shi Shi) and Mei Sheng (male, born to Bai Yun and Gao Gao), were born at the San Diego Zoo, in 1999 and 2003, respectively. [...] Since then, four more giant panda cubs, Su Lin and Zhen Zhen (both females), Yun Zi (male), Xiao Liwu (male), have been born to the resident giant panda parents Bai Yun and Gao Gao. All these American-born cubs except Xiao Liwu have been sent back to China to participate in the breeding program there. These giant pandas are viewable from a web based exhibit called the San Diego Zoo panda cam. A sixth cub, Xiao Liwu (meaning [...] "little gift"), was born on July 29, 2012 and was <b>first</b> <b>let</b> outside for visitors to see on January 9, 2013. [...] In addition to being able to view this rare animal species, the nearby Giant Panda Discovery Center has interactive exhibits that let the visitor experience first hand what the animals smell and sound like. [...] Since the opening of Panda Trek there are now Sichuan takins, a red panda, Snow leopards, Amur leopards, north chinese leopards, Mangshan pitvipers, and an exhibit comparing several types of bamboo. The exhibit is currently under renovations, and the pandas have been moved into Sun Bear Forest. As the renovations are nearing completion, the red pandas and takins have been moved back to their exhibits. The panda's exhibit is nearing compleation and the pandas are scheduled to return.|$|E
