500|$|One former islander, James Simpson, {{recalls that}} [...] "we had {{about two hundred}} and fifty <b>folks</b> <b>here</b> when I was a boy. It never seemed a lonely place. There were always people {{going in and out of}} each other's houses, there were forty {{children}} at the school and there were two teachers. We had concerts; three concerts in the winter when you had to sing loud to get above the sound of the wind. The young people would meet at the shop in the long, long evenings in summer." [...] The island had some distinctively eccentric characters: Donald Banks, the island's coffin-maker, was known for quarrelling with his neighbours (telling one family, [...] "I'll no bury any more o' ye!") and combining poetry with coffin-making, as in the order he placed with a mainland supplier: ...|$|E
2500|$|The L.A. Times {{announced}} {{the winners of}} its in-house editorial awards May 2011. The paper's Pulitzer Prize-winning Bell coverage won in the [...] "investigations" [...] category {{as well as the}} Publisher's Prize. The Times publisher Eddie Hartenstein said of his paper's Bell coverage: [...] "Robert Rizzo and his cronies, I think, savored their windfall and knew all too well what they were doing and knew they had to keep it secret. And if anyone was bold enough to uncover it, it was some of our <b>folks</b> <b>here.</b> They went to ask the city clerks at Bell, Calif., and the response they got repeatedly was 'Those records aren't available; come back in two weeks.' But they wouldn't accept that ... hen [...] finally came off the Bell salary scandal, it was not because of a grand jury or a conscience-stricken official or anything like that. It was because of two intrepid L.A. Times reporters." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're {{just the}} same as when you went away," [...] he said. [...] "They haven't made a fine lady of you. <b>Folks</b> <b>here</b> thought you'd be {{something}} wonderful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, but I had {{a narrow}} escape. My honest fellows {{took me to}} my uncle at Wearmouth, and he shipped me off with the good <b>folk</b> <b>here,</b> and cares for my maintenance. How didst thou 'scape?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{hope you}} are not tired after your journey, Sir Agravaine? My little girl did not bore you, I trust? We are very quiet <b>folk</b> <b>here.</b> Country mice. But we must try to make your visit interesting.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} only {{show me where}} my opinion can be of any use I shall be most happy," [...] said Robert. [...] "My people come from Birmingham, but I know most of the <b>folk</b> <b>here</b> and their position." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Going to {{be plenty}} of <b>folks</b> <b>here</b> to see the circus," [...] was Snap's comment, and his words proved true, folks {{flocking}} in from every quarter of the surrounding districts.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am glad we saw Jed," [...] said Shep as they trudged along. [...] "That {{will save}} us {{the trip to}} town. I hope he gets the circus <b>folks</b> <b>here</b> soon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{a lot of}} <b>folks</b> <b>here</b> this summer, mother says," [...] he {{appealed from}} the check he had got to Jackson. [...] "Every room taken for the whole month, she says." ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>folk</b> <b>here</b> are civil, and, {{like the}} barbarians unto the holy apostle, have shown me much kindness; {{and there are}} a sort of chosen people in the land, for they have some kirks without organs that are like ours, and are called meeting-houses, where the {{minister}} preaches without a gown.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{what makes}} it worse with me {{is that you are}} not my real mother, and you needn't have had me unless you liked. I oughtn't to have come to 'ee--that's the real truth! I troubled 'em in Australia, and I trouble <b>folk</b> <b>here.</b> I wish I hadn't been born!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is bad," [...] {{the other}} agreed, {{and his face}} fell. But remembering what Garnache had said, he was quick to {{brighten}} again. [...] "Is it to these <b>folk</b> <b>here</b> at Condillac?" [...] he asked. Garnache nodded. [...] "And they would pay--these people that seek our service would pay you fifty pistoles?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It seems {{hard work}} to find out {{anything}} about this Valdi," [...] he said. [...] "Either the <b>folks</b> <b>here</b> do not know him, or they won't acknowledge his acquaintance. We may as well follow suit, and avoid him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Tot, slowly, [...] "he {{said the}} <b>folks</b> <b>here</b> were good to eat; an'--an'--he {{held his hand}} behind his back--right {{in front of my}} mouth; an'--so I took one of little bite off his fingers, an'--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hard cases!" [...] said Harry presently. [...] "If I was sheriff I'd clean {{this hole}} right out. There are decent <b>folks</b> <b>here,</b> but {{the curious thing}} {{is that when you}} let two or three toughs into a place they seem to get on top." ...|$|E
50|$|According {{to local}} legend, Frans Hals painted his fisher <b>folk</b> <b>here</b> and his {{portrait}} of Yonker Ramp and his sweetheart was painted inside in 1623. The painting, {{now in the}} collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, was on loan to the Frans Hals Museum for their jubileum exhibition on Frans Hals in 1937.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good <b>folk,</b> <b>here</b> is {{a little}} trifle for you"--handing the miller-guns {{as if it were}} a matter of no consequence, though each of them {{contained}} fifteen cents in solid cash; and while the poor creatures went to pieces with astonishment and gratitude, I turned to the others and said as calmly as one would ask the time of day: ...|$|R
6000|$|Meanwhile Nehushta had no {{time for}} grief, since the babe must be fed, and within twelve hours. Yet, as she could not bury her, and would not throw her to the sharks, she was minded to give her {{mistress}} a royal funeral after the custom of her own Libyan <b>folk.</b> <b>Here</b> was flame, and what pyre could be grander than this great ship? ...|$|R
6000|$|The elder {{shook his}} head; grinned solemnly; and peace was concluded. [...] "We'm old-fashioned <b>folks</b> <b>here,</b> you see, sir; and don't like no new-fangled meddlecomes. You'll excuse us; you'm very welcome {{to do what}} you like, and glad to see you here." [...] And the old fellow made a stately bow, and moved away.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs Durbeyfield {{was welcomed}} with glances and nods by the {{remainder}} of the conclave, and turned to where her husband sat. He was humming absently to himself, in a low tone: [...] "I be as good as some <b>folks</b> <b>here</b> and there! I've got a great family vault at Kingsbere-sub-Greenhill, and finer skillentons than any man in Wessex!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All the <b>folks</b> <b>here</b> must be asleep," [...] said Snap. But as {{he spoke}} a man came {{from one of the}} tents and stared at them. It was Andrew Felps, the rich lumber {{merchant}} who owned much of the land around the lake and who had treated them so meanly the summer and the winter previous.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] went on Cicely, [...] "we {{have worked}} no sorcery, and my crime is that I will not name my child a bastard and sign away my lands and goods to yonder Abbot, the murderer {{of my father}} and perhaps of my husband. Oh! listen, listen, you and all <b>folk</b> <b>here,</b> and briefly as I may I will tell my tale. Have I your leave to speak?" ...|$|R
6000|$|In our country, {{children}} play [...] "keep house;" [...] {{and in the}} same high-sounding but miniature way the grown <b>folk</b> <b>here,</b> with the poor little material of slender territory and meagre population, play [...] "empire." [...] There is his royal Majesty the King, with a New York detective's income of thirty or thirty-five thousand dollars a year from the [...] "royal civil list" [...] and the [...] "royal domain." [...] He lives in a two-story frame [...] "palace." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'With all modesty, I want {{to stand}} up here as a {{representative}} business man and gently whisper, [...] "Here's our kind of <b>folks!</b> <b>Here's</b> the specifications of the Standardized American Citizen! Here's {{the new generation of}} Americans: fellows with hair on their chests and smiles in their eyes and adding-machines in their offices. We're not doing any boasting, but we like ourselves first-rate, and if you don't like us, look out--better get under cover before the cyclone hits town!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, that's how {{you look}} at it, Davenport," [...] said another of the men. [...] "You must remember, Lorimer Spell had a good many friends in this neighborhood. Of course he was a queer Dick and all that sort of thing, but in spite of that <b>folks</b> <b>here</b> would want to have Spell's wishes in this matter upheld." ...|$|E
6000|$|Ormsgill {{smiled and}} shook his head. [...] "You and other well meaning persons {{occasionally}} go {{the wrong way to}} work, padre," [...] he said. [...] "Would you pile up the Hamburg gin merchants' profits, or encourage the <b>folks</b> <b>here</b> to build new sugar factories? You can't stop the trade in question while the soil is fruitful and the African is what he is." ...|$|E
6000|$|Sam Cotting, the store-keeper, gazed {{after the}} livery {{team with a}} sour countenance, he resented the fact that five big-boxes of {{groceries}} had been forwarded from {{the city to the}} Wegg farm. [...] "What'n thunder's the use havin' city <b>folks</b> <b>here,</b> ef they don't buy nothin'?" [...] he asked the boys; and they agreed it was no use at all.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; {{of course}} not. I shouldn't care {{to hear you}} say you did. He's a likely lad, and he's a Christian, which is more than these <b>folk</b> <b>here,</b> in spite o' all their praying and preaching. There's a party {{starting}} for Nevada to-morrow, and I'll manage to send him a message letting him know the hole we are in. If I know anything o' that young man, he'll be back here with a speed that would whip electro-telegraphs." ...|$|R
50|$|In this {{featurette}} the Quintet song team presents original songs, works {{derived from}} classical material, and <b>folk</b> songs. <b>Here</b> {{are some of}} them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ever {{since last}} spring, when the Princess Royal died, and thus {{extinguished}} the last spark of forbearance in the King's breast, I have been here, there, and everywhere--Romney Marsh, Drury Lane, Paris, besides {{this place and}} Pilpignon, where I have a snug harbour for the yacht, Ma Belle Annik, as the Breton sailors call her. The crew are chiefly Breton; it saves gossip; but I have a boat's crew of our own English <b>folk</b> <b>here,</b> stout fellows, ready for anything by land or sea." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{can throw}} himself into any pursuit,' said James, as he {{paused at the}} door with Miss Conway; but {{suddenly}} becoming aware of the slimy entanglement round his hat, he exclaimed, 'Absurd fellow!' and pulled it off rather petulantly, adding, with a little constraint, 'Recovery does put people into mad spirits! I fancy the honest <b>folks</b> <b>here</b> look on in amaze.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} you want, you poor little thing; but how am I goin' to get it for you to-night? Why won't {{you try to make}} the best of it till mornin', an' then we'll be sure to find your <b>folks?</b> <b>Here,</b> eat some of these peanuts; they must be awful good, 'cordin' to the way Plums pitched into 'em last night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wanted to}} sometimes, but the <b>folks</b> <b>here</b> were so dreadful {{good to me}} I couldn't," [...] confessed Ben, {{secretly}} {{surprised to find that}} the prospect of going off with Daddy even cost him a pang of regret, for the boy had taken root in the friendly soil, and was no longer a wandering thistle-down, tossed about by every wind that blew.|$|E
6000|$|... "How do you know? The <b>folks</b> 'round <b>here</b> {{have seen}} what I can do, an' they'll soon find out that there's {{a good deal of}} fight left." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I daresay you're right," [...] said Hemmingway cheerfully, [...] "but I don't {{clearly see}} what the <b>folks</b> about <b>here</b> {{have to do with}} our {{situation}} just now." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{how pretty}} she is! she thought. Won't the <b>folks</b> around <b>here</b> stare at her! They always do at our boarders, but we've {{never had one}} like her.|$|R
