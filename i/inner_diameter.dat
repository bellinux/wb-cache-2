40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to achieve three {{objective}}s. The first {{objective was to}} investigate the effects of straw phonation on vocal attack time (VAT). The second objective was to find out whether VAT values vary with straws of different <b>inner</b> <b>diameters.</b> The third objective was to determine if VAT varies as a function of different tones during straw phonations. Ten males and 10 females participated in the study. VAT values were obtained from their phonation during an open-mouth condition and during phonation into straws of different <b>inner</b> <b>diameters.</b> Results revealed that straw phonations yielded significantly longer VAT than open-mouth phonations. However, the VAT values obtained from straw phonation of different <b>inner</b> <b>diameters</b> were similar. Tone-by-gender interactive effects also existed. Contour tones yielded significantly longer VAT than level tones in female but similar tone effect did not exist in male.

The project to build the new line, including the Swan View Tunnel, was managed by the Engineer-in-Chief of the Western Australian Government Railways, C Y O'Connor. Work began in 1894, with the two bores meeting on 18 April 1895. The tunnel opened on 22 February 1896. The unstable nature of the jointed granite, along with clay seams, caused difficulties during construction of the tunnel.

25|$|Collagen is {{the major}} {{component}} of the extracellular matrix and has been widely used in nerve regeneration and repair. Due to its smooth microgeometry and permeability, collagen gels are able to allow diffusion of molecules through them. Collagen resorption rates are able {{to be controlled by}} crosslinking collagen with polypoxy compounds. Additionally, collagen type I/III scaffolds have demonstrated good biocompatibility and are able to promote Schwann cell proliferation. However, collagen conduits filled with Schwann cells used to bridge nerve gaps in rats have shown surprisingly unsuccessful nerve regeneration compared to nerve autografts. This is because biocompatibility is not the only factor necessary for successful nerve regeneration; other parameters such as <b>inner</b> <b>diameter,</b> inner microtopography, porosity, wall thickness, and Schwann cell seeding density will need to be examined in future studies in order to improve the results obtained by these collagen I/III gels.|$|E
25|$|A molding {{technique}} {{was created by}} Wang et al. for forming a nerve guidance conduit with a multi-channel inner matrix and an outer tube wall from chitosan. In their 2006 study, Wang et al. threaded acupuncture needles through a hollow chitosan tube, where they are {{held in place by}} fixing, on either end, patches created using CAD. A chitosan solution is then injected into the tube and solidified, after which the needles are removed, creating longitudinally oriented channels. A representative scaffold was then created for characterization with 21 channels using acupuncture needles of 400µm in diameter. Upon investigation under a microscope, the channels were found to be approximately circular with slight irregularities; all channels were aligned with the <b>inner</b> <b>diameter</b> of the outer tube wall. It was confirmed by micro-CT imaging that the channels went through {{the entire length of the}} scaffold. Under water absorption, the inner and outer diameters of the scaffold became larger, but the channel diameters did not vary significantly, which is necessary for maintaining the scaffold shape that guides neurite extension. The inner structure provides an increase in compressive strength compared to a hollow tube alone, which can prevent collapse of the scaffold onto growing neurites. Neuro-2a cells were able to growth on the inner matrix of the scaffold, and they oriented along the channels. Although this method has only been tested on chitosan, it can be tailored to other materials.|$|E
25|$|Baffle Design: baffles {{are used}} in shell and tube heat {{exchangers}} to direct fluid across the tube bundle. They run perpendicularly to the shell and hold the bundle, preventing the tubes from sagging over a long length. They can also prevent the tubes from vibrating. The {{most common type of}} baffle is the segmental baffle. The semicircular segmental baffles are oriented at 180 degrees to the adjacent baffles forcing the fluid to flow upward and downwards between the tube bundle. Baffle spacing is of large thermodynamic concern when designing shell and tube heat exchangers. Baffles must be spaced with consideration for the conversion of pressure drop and heat transfer. For thermo economic optimization it is suggested that the baffles be spaced no closer than 20% of the shell’s <b>inner</b> <b>diameter.</b> Having baffles spaced too closely causes a greater pressure drop because of flow redirection. Consequently, having the baffles spaced too far apart means that there may be cooler spots in the corners between baffles. It is also important to ensure the baffles are spaced close enough that the tubes do not sag. The other main type of baffle is the disc and doughnut baffle, which consists of two concentric baffles. An outer, wider baffle looks like a doughnut, whilst the inner baffle is shaped like a disk. This type of baffle forces the fluid to pass around each side of the disk then through the doughnut baffle generating a different type of fluid flow.|$|E
