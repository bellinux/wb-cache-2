An examination of anosognosia for hemiplegia—the inability to recognise that one is paralysed down one side <b>of</b> one’s body—suggests <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> ‘online’ and ‘offline’ representations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> Online representations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> are representations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> as it is currently, are newly constructed moment by moment and are directly “plugged into” current perception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> In contrast, offline representations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> are representations <b>of</b> what <b>the</b> <b>body</b> is usually like, are relatively stable and are constructed from online representations.

Initially it seems that <b>the</b> sense <b>of</b> embodiment may arise from either {{of these types of}} representation; however, an integrated representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> seems to be required.

40|$|<b>The</b> term evocative <b>body</b> {{refers to}} a concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> introducing, {{defining}} and explaining <b>the</b> ‘evocative’ nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> in performance. It is a condition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> capable <b>of</b> evoking emotions, imagination and imageries in and between bodies. It is purely a performative organization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> in a performance, oriented towards poetic reasons. It is magical and trance-formational. The paper will address some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> key issues in <b>the</b> conceptualization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> in recent theories <b>of</b> performance relocating <b>the</b> ‘evocative’ nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> performer’s <b>body</b> within <b>the</b> wider debates <b>of</b> technique as knowledge.

5000|$|Skin {{wettedness}} {{is defined}} as [...] "the proportion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total skin surface area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> covered with sweat."The wetness of skin in different areas also affects perceived thermal comfort. Humidity can increase wetness on different areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> leading to a perception of discomfort. This is usually localized in different parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> and local thermal comfort limits for skin wettedness differ by locations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> [...] <b>The</b> extremities are much more sensitive to thermal discomfort from wetness than <b>the</b> trunk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> Although local thermal discomfort can be caused from wetness, <b>the</b> thermal comfort <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole <b>body</b> will not be affected by <b>the</b> wetness <b>of</b> certain parts.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{emerged from}} a rejection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corporeal <b>body</b> as a clean, sterile entity that can be neatly contained by <b>the</b> boundaries <b>of</b> skin. Informed by Lacan’s (1977, 1979) notions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> and desire and Kristeva’s (1982) perspectives on the abject, I have developed a concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unfixed status <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> as an in-between condition. This investigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> in-between condition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> critically explores notions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corporeal <b>body</b> as constructed physically, psychically and symbolically through my creative arts praxis concerning <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> garment, object and performance. This exegesis unveils {{the potential for a}} reflexive and critical investigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> in-between condition through a blurring <b>of</b> garment and <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> This blurring reveals <b>the</b> undefined margins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> that simultaneously manifest desire and repulsion for the viewer and wearer (viewed). This critical inquiry, carried out through <b>the</b> merging <b>of</b> theory and practice in my creative arts praxis, forms the reflexive methodology that demonstrates <b>the</b> <b>body</b> is {{in a constant state of}} change and is an unstable concept. The in-between condition demonstrates <b>the</b> <b>body</b> as penetrable, fluid and ambiguous. <b>The</b> unfixed parameters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> are both disturbing and enticing and have been explored through the accumulative exhibitions undertaken throughout my candidature; Fashion[ing] forms (2014), Becomings (2014), Progress (2013), The in-between: An inquiry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> <b>The</b> final exhibition <b>of</b> my candidature, Peel, Fondle, Ogle in February 2015 explored the potential for <b>the</b> gaze <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> viewer and the viewed (Lacan, 1979) to physically and emotionally generate a response to <b>the</b> in-between condition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> Experimentation <b>of</b> gaze within this research extends <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body’s</b> uncontainable status due its in-between condition.
