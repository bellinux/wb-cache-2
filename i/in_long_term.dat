This is 4% less than the 2001 figure of 71,900, and the highest percentage population loss in the country between 2001 and 2011. The Office for National Statistics states Barrow's population as being <b>in</b> <b>long</b> <b>term</b> decline with a projected population of around 65,000 by 2037. This is largely a result of negative net migration.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} both the forms of sleep are found in mammals and birds, but not in {{reptiles}} (which {{are considered to be}} an intermediate stage) indicates that sleep might have evolved separately in both. Substantiating this might be followed by further research on whether the EEG correlates of sleep are involved in its functions or if they are merely a feature. This might further help in understanding the role of sleep <b>in</b> <b>long</b> <b>term</b> plasticity.|$|E
25|$|Two {{modalities}} of dialysis {{can be used}} in {{the treatment}} of ADPKD patients: peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis. Epidemiological data shows that ADPKD affects 5-13.4% of patients undergoing hemodialysis in Europe and in the United States, and about 3% in Japan. Peritoneal dialysis has usually been contra-indicated in ADPKD patients with large kidney and liver volumes, due to expected physical difficulties in the procedure and possible complications; however, recent studies suggest there is no difference <b>in</b> <b>long</b> <b>term</b> morbidity between hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis in ADPKD.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the revolt}} failed {{to fulfill the}} Ibadi goal of {{ultimately}} supplanting the Umayyads, it nevertheless marked the attempt of the Ibadis {{to create their own}} independent imamate. Over the following decades the Ibadis continued their revolutionary activities and established a number of additional movements throughout the Muslim world. Several of these eventually turned ended <b>in</b> <b>long</b> <b>term</b> gains for the sect, notably in Oman, where two Ibadi imamates (750–752 and 793–893) were formed, and in the Maghreb, where the Rustamid dynasty lasted for over a century.|$|E
25|$|Reprocessing can {{potentially}} recover up to 95% {{of the remaining}} uranium and plutonium in spent nuclear fuel, putting it into new mixed oxide fuel. This produces a reduction <b>in</b> <b>long</b> <b>term</b> radioactivity within the remaining waste, since this is largely short-lived fission products, and reduces its volume by over 90%. Reprocessing of civilian fuel from power reactors is currently done in Europe, Russia, Japan, and India. The full potential of reprocessing has not been achieved because it requires breeder reactors, which are not commercially available.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two ways}} to {{approach}} these symptoms using drugs: rate control and rhythm control. Rate control seeks to reduce the heart rate to one that is closer to normal, usually 60 to 100bpm, without trying to convert to a regular rhythm. Rhythm control seeks to restore with cardioversion the regular heart rhythm and maintain it with drugs. Studies suggest that rhythm control is mainly a concern in newly diagnosed AF, while rate control is more important in the chronic phase. Rate control with anticoagulation is as effective a treatment as rhythm control <b>in</b> <b>long</b> <b>term</b> mortality studies, the AFFIRM Trial.|$|E

25|$|Ahmed Shah Abdali– a Pashtun– {{embarked}} on a conquest in South Asia starting in 1747. In the short space of just {{over a quarter of}} a century, he forged one of the largest Muslim empires of the 18th century. The high point of his conquests was his victory over the powerful Marathas in the third Battle of Panipat 1761. In South Asia his empire stretched from the Indus at Attock {{all the way to the}} outskirts of Delhi. Uninterested <b>in</b> <b>long</b> <b>term</b> of conquest or in replacing the Mughal Empire, he became increasingly pre occupied with revolts by the Sikhs. His empire started to unravel not long after his death.|$|E
25|$|Diarrhea {{can cause}} {{electrolyte}} imbalances, renal impairment, dehydration, and defective immune system responses. When oral drugs are administered, {{the efficiency of}} the drug is to produce a therapeutic effect and the lack of this effect {{may be due to the}} medication travelling too quickly through the digestive system, limiting the time that it can be absorbed. Clinicians try to treat the diarrheas by reducing the dosage of medication, changing the dosing schedule, discontinuation of the drug, and rehydration. The interventions to control the diarrhea are not often effective. Diarrhea can have a profound effect on the quality of life because fecal incontinence is one of the leading factors for placing older adults <b>in</b> <b>long</b> <b>term</b> care facilities (nursing homes).|$|E

25|$|Therefore, {{the enemy}} is forced to attack the {{defensive}} trenches with conventional infantry assault (as during World War I) {{at the cost of}} terrible losses, without assistance of armored forces or line-of-sight firing guns. Because of the possibility of redeployment, significantly less manpower is required than the Maginot-like defenses. The semi-mobile engagement also psychologically preferable than the claustrophobic feeling of Maginot-like bunkers <b>in</b> <b>long</b> <b>term.</b> This type of defensive line required 5-10 times less manpower and concrete per kilometer than the Maginot or Siegfried line with equal (or more) effectiveness, but far more imagination is required from the builders because every part of the line were inevitably unique design adapted to local conditions.|$|E
25|$|In Tekken 3, {{after being}} placed in {{suspended}} animation during the second tournament, Nina was awoken 19 years later by {{the influence of the}} recently excavated Ogre, who compelled her to assassinate Jin Kazama. As per her request, Anna was awoken {{at the same time as}} her sister, though she was unaffected by Ogre's influence. Nina also began to suffer ill effects from the 'cold-sleep', resulting <b>in</b> <b>long</b> <b>term</b> memory loss. In an act of compassion, Anna set out to stop Nina from once again becoming an assassin, and to help her recover her memory loss. However, she failed at the end of the tournament when Nina recovered her memory about her rivalry with Anna, which resulted in Nina leaving and cutting all contact with Anna.|$|E
25|$|The hippocampal neocortical dialog {{refers to}} the very {{structured}} interactions during SWS between groups of neurons called ensembles in the hippocampus and neocortex. Sharp wave patterns (SPW) dominate the hippocampus during SWS and neuron populations in the hippocampus participate in organized bursts during this phase. This is done in synchrony with state changes in the cortex (DOWN/UP state) and coordinated by the slow oscillations in cortex. These observations, coupled {{with the knowledge that}} the hippocampus plays a role in short to medium term memory whereas the cortex plays a role <b>in</b> <b>long</b> <b>term</b> memory, have led to the hypothesis that the hippocampal neocortical dialog might be a mechanism through which the hippocampus transfers information to the cortex. Thus, the hippocampal neocortical dialog is said {{to play a role in}} memory consolidation.|$|E
