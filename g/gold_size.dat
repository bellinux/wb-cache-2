It has been established that the performance of the supported gold catalysts is largely dependent on the <b>gold</b> particle <b>size.</b> It is therefore of paramount importance to control the <b>gold</b> particle <b>size.</b> In the present work, we demonstrated that by alloying gold with copper, the <b>gold</b> particle <b>size</b> could be well controlled within a range of 2 ~ 3 nm on the SBA- 15 support, and thus the catalytic activity for CO oxidation was enhanced significantly. In-situ XRD and TEM techniques were employed to trace the alloy formation process during the reduction, the particle growth and the phase segregation occurring during the reaction. The results showed that the Au-Cu alloy phase was formed when the reduction was performed in H 2 at a temperature higher than 350 oC. However, under the CO oxidation atmosphere, the alloy phase gradually separated with increasing the reaction temperature, into a monometallic gold phase and a copper oxide phase. Possibly attributed to the presence of a thin layer of copper oxides on the gold surface, the <b>gold</b> particle <b>size</b> remained unchanged even at a higher reaction temperature, which was remarkably superior to the monometallic gold catalysts. 第十四届国际催化会议组委...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: With new {{applications}} {{in the area of}} diagnostics, drug discovery and genetics, the need for Biological Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (BioMEMS) has increased tremendously in the last decade. Especially, surface stress-based BioMEMS has been investigated extensively in the recently years. In this paper, a new BioMEMS is proposed, which can be used to detect cells. It consists of microfluidics, square membrane and a fiber optic interferometer. The square membrane as the crucial and sensitive part includes three layers, self-assembled monolayer (SAM), gold and substrate material. Based on the BioMEMS, some fundamental study has been done, especially for the membrane due to its crucial role in the whole system. The finite element (FE) method has been used to study the membrane with different substrates. By the fundamental study, some important conclusions have been acquired: (1) The square membrane will reach maximal deflection at different ratio values (P: membrane size) to different substrates; (2) To a certain substrate, such as PDMS, the ratio making the membrane reach maximal deflection is different to dissimilar PDMS layer thickness; (3) If young’s modulus (E) of the substrate is too small, separation may happen between the gold layer and substrate layer when the <b>gold</b> <b>size</b> becomes smaller...|$|E

Thus, {{the development of an}} effective antifilarial strategy has become a global research thrust mandated by the World Health Organization. Nanoparticles of silver endowed with antibacterial potency are known to induce apoptosis in eukaryotic cells. The present study was designed to investigate the possible microfilaricidal efficacy of silver nanoparticles and to establish the validity of apoptotic rationale in antifilarial drug designing. Methods: This report analyzed the effect of nanoparticles of silver as well as <b>gold</b> (<b>size</b> range: 10 &ndash; 15 nm) on the microfilariae of Brugia malayi obtained from the lavage of peritoneal cavities of infected jirds (Meriones unguiculatus). The study included a microfilarial motility assay, a trypan blue exclusion test, a poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase activity study, ethidium bromide/acridine orange differential staining, and transmission, as well as scanning electron microscopic evaluation of ultrastructural changes in microfilariae. Results: The study demonstrates that nanoparticles of silver, but not of gold, elicited significant loss in microfilarial motility. Differential staining of parasites with ethidium bromide and acridine orange, poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase activity in microfilarial lysate, and electron microscopic findings underscored apoptotic death of parasites attributable to nanosilver. In a trypan blue exclusion test, the 50 % lethal dose of nanosilver was measured to be 101. 2 &micro;M, which was higher than the recorded complete inhibitory concentration value (50. 6 &micro;M), thus supporting nanosilver as a potential drug candidate against lymphatic filariasis. Conclusion: The present report provides the first ever conclusive proof in support of apoptosis as a novel stratagem in antifilarial drug designing and nanoscale silver as a valid lead in research on antifilarial therapeutics. The main embargo about the current drug diethylcarbamazine citrate is its empirical use without rationale. Effective microfilaricidal activity of nanosilver at relatively low concentrations as reported in this study, with evidence of the induction of apoptosis in microfilariae, projects nanosilver as a potential drug adjuvant against lymphatic filariasis. The much higher 50 % lethal dose value of nanosilver compared to the complete inhibitory concentration value reported in this study argues in favor of a safe therapeutic window of this agent in its antifilarial efficacy.
