40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 87 - 88) In {{the opening}} chapter of Slaughterhouse-Five, Kurt Vonnegut says, ???When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> the Second World War???, I {{thought it would}} be easy for me to write about the destruction of Dresden, since all I would have to do would be to report what I had seen??? (p. 2). In fact, however, he could not write about his experiences in the war [...] the firebombing of Dresden in particular [...] for twenty-three years, after writing five novels. As numerous critics have noted and Vonnegut himself has alluded, the destruction of Dresden was the destruction of Kurt Vonnegut. He went to war with a world view founded on order, stability, and justice, but encountered a world filled with insanity, absurdity, and irrationality. Before he could write about the war, he needed to rebuild himself emotionally and psychologically, a struggle that underlies his work up to and in Slaughterhouse-Five. What he learned during those twenty-three years is what he communicates in his first six novels, primarily through the protagonist of each. For what Vonnegut tries to do, above all, in these novels is to create a character who can live with dignity in an insane world. The character who can find dignity {{in the midst of an}} incomprehensible horror such as Dresden is a Vonnegut hero. This paper focuses on the protagonists in Vonnegut's first six novels to see how they advance his search for a hero. Trying to come to terms with his devastating experiences in the war, Vonnegut creates real and metaphoric Dresdens and then explores ways in which his protagonists can derive a sense of dignity and purpose from their deranged worlds. He varies his tactics from one novel to the next and often employs farfetched science fiction gimmicks like Tralfamadore, ice- 9, and time travel. Yet his overriding concern remains constant, until he is finally able to tell his "war story. " With the writing of Slaughterhouse-Five, he exorcises the demon that Dresden had created and brings to a close a long, painful period in his life...|$|E

Every time I {{hear from you}} I just can’t believe I’m so lucky. You’re so wonderful—I’m so glad that you didn’t {{go to the movies}} on Sunday, honey, and wrote instead. It was so nice to get such a real long letter from you—I hope you write again {{tomorrow}} night (That’s last night) —Very complicated, huh? I miss you, too, honey. Golly, every week it gets worse 2 ̆ 6 worse or maybe better 2 ̆ 6 better. It all depends on how you look at it. Yes, it did see[m] rather funny to have you put me on a train for a change. I like it anyway. I hate trains now, though. They’re always separating us. Well, I still don’t know about my job. They haven’t said anything but that’s not good or bad. Don’t know what they’ll do now. I sure do hope they wait until after March, because I do want to get their dresses for when we’re married. I didn’t want to say anything about it this weekend. Oh, well, what will be, will be. (Freddy Slack is playing “A Woman always Pays. ”) The words are so right, too. Oh, honey, my hair doesn’t look well up 2 ̆ 6 I don’t feel comfortable with it up either. The only time I could be happy with it up is in the summer. Honestly, honey, I’d be unhappy with it up 2 ̆ 6 cold besides. Lord, if you think I look nice in the morning when I wake up, then I’m afraid you’re in for a big disappointment. Oh, the without makeup part isn’t so bad. I have natural color, thank heavens 2 ̆ 6 I never have had to wear any make up but lipstick but oh—well, you’ll have to wait til March to be disillusioned anyway. When I wake up I won’t have just brushed my hair 2 ̆ 6 that will make a big difference—believe me, you won’t like it. Tell me some more things to do {{to get you out of}} bad moods. I don’t think that any of the things you mentioned would be sufficient to do it. I was in a pretty sad mood, too but we both got out of them o. k. Yes, hon, we do have the same moods together. Pretty much the same anyway. I just hope we both never get real mad at the same time. That I wouldn’t like to see. Yes, hon, for a change we did a lot of talking or rather you did a lot of talking. No, you didn’t say too much. I’m glad that you told me about your little shall we say adventures or what would you like to refer to them as? You know I believe in telling the truth and that I’d much rather have you tell me about things you’ve done than hear about them from someone else. Even if I never did hear about them from anyone else, I’m glad you told me. I hope you’ll always be frank (oh, how can you be when you [are] Judson) —but seriously, honey, I am glad you told me. I hope there aren’t any more but I hope if there are you’ll tell me. Golly, honey, this war seems to be going on 2 ̆ 6 on 2 ̆ 6 on. I don’t think it will ever end. It would be wonderful if it ended before March. I know how you feel about going over and getting a crack at the Japs but I hate to think of all the kids that are going to be killed before it ends. I’m afraid a lot of the fellows that I write to aren’t going to be interested in getting any mail from me now that we’re engaged. It will probably change their outlook on the situation a little—Gee, I love you, honey. Well, my little weather bureau for once you were almost right. It did snow, of course, not when you expected it, at least not here anyway. It was very exciting 2 ̆ 6 I hope we have a white Christmas. That reminds me I have to get a pair of shoes with ties in them so that if it does snow my toes won’t get wet. I have the simplest mind. Honestly—the way I ramble on 2 ̆ 6 on. How do you ever read my letters more than once. I never read them over. Writing them is confusing enough. They weren’t meant to be read more than once over lightly. Gee, darling, I love you so. You’re the most wonderful man in the world. I love you so. Honey, how many hours do you have left out of the thirty you were supposed to have finished at the end of this training? Very many? Betty Grable is on the Dick Haymes show now—stop drooling!! Gee, Harry James sure did all right for himself. Remember that night at the Meadowbrook? How could you forget. Look what happened. You’re practically a married man! Got a letter from Bob last night. It was a riot as usual. He said he’s going to come 2 ̆ 6 see me this Christmas 2 ̆ 6 watch me blush. Fine. He didn’t mention what he was going to say but that’s beside the point. He really is a good guy. I’m glad you like ‘always’ now. Yes, I like “Always” 2 ̆ 6 think that would be a pretty good song—I’m afraid there are a couple of songs, popular now, that remind me of you much more, though. One is “I Didn’t Know About You” and another is “There Goes That Song Again. ” (Helen Forest is singing “Don’t Ever Change. ” That’s nice too.) Paper Moon 2 ̆ 6 “Her Tears Flowed Like Wine” also remind me of you very much. Honey, do you think Steve is serious about Woody? Is he going to be your best man? You asked him, didn’t you or didn’t you? Gee, I love you so, honey. You have all my love so I can’t send you any more. Oh, this morning I rode down with Woody. She was talking away and I was dreaming about you 2 ̆ 6 she’d be asking me something over five times before I’d notice it. We (she came over to where I work) went to look at raincoats 2 ̆ 6 went home together. She got her report marks or something 2 ̆ 6 they were all good. Did quite a bit of Christmas shopping this noon time—I was dropping packages all the way home. Woody just called 2 ̆ 6 I sprayed that spray 2 ̆ 6 am sitting here sniffing. Reminds me of last Saturday night. My father was murdering me to get me off the phone. Well, now I can write you more. Gee, I love you so, my darling. You’re so wonderful. It’s so nice to be in love with you. Honey, what do you wish usually? Tell me, please. Darling, I love you so. Gee, I can imagine you waking me up in the morning—I hate to get up. Jackie was telling me how Greg [?] calls until he’s almost hoarse to get her up but she just rolls over. I detest waking up. Maybe if you’re doing the waking I won’t mind it so much. Well, sweetheart, I’d better get some of the millions of things I should be doing done—what a sentence! Anyhow, since <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> work I’ve just eaten 2 ̆ 6 written you. I love you, honey. All my love,Dottie the Morse Code Iunderstood—ditto— P. S. I love you, my darling. I hope this week doesn’t take too long. [Transcription ends...|$|E
40|$|Translation begins] Wednesday My Darling, When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> work tonight {{found two}} valentines {{and a letter}} from you. You’re so sweet, honey- Happy Valentine’s day, darling. This letter {{certainly}} isn’t progressing very rapidly. Interruptions- always interruptions. Let’s see, where was I. Oh, yes, happy- oh I said that already {{as you can tell}} I’m a little confused. Have you told Sweetie what time we’re getting married? What a nice sound that has. Will he be able to get there in time? How far away are you from him? It’s freezing in here- I’m curled up under a blanket. Wish you were here honey. Boy will I be glad to get down there where it’s nice and warm. Probably the temperature will hit an all time low march 9 th. Golly, darling, why does time go so darned slowly when we’re apart and so fast the minute we’re together. Trying to locate my calendar now to count the days until March 11 th. About five times a day I count and always get the same answer. Found it. Only 25 more days, darling. Will you be able to see us at all. I hope that we can be together for a while before we’re married. Everyone keeps telling me that’s the happiest time- fine thing, that’s very encouraging. But it certainly has been wonderful even though we weren’t together very much. In 12 more days I won’t be working. That will be so nice. Lying in bed all morning, what a lovely dream. Golly, I won’t be able to lie in bed in the morning until after we’re married- I’ll have to much to do. Remember that street car conductor that I told you about. He married 12 women + said he must have been crazy. He looked like such a wonderful nice old man. That just goes to prove- you never can tell about men! Oh, honey, I finally found a Valentine that was half way what I wanted. You probably won’t get it until after Valentine’s day. Anyway, the thought was there. What a day. We got out early today again. Thank goodness. I’m sorry that I didn’t write last night or at least I don’t think I did. At this point I’m not sure about anything. Honestly, what a fog I’m in. Anyhow to get back to last night. Went to see “The Very Thought of You”. Gee, it was cute- Have you seen it? It reminded me so much of you + I + Woody + Steve. Almost any picture lately reminds me of you though. You wrote in your letter last Friday that you missed me that night more than usual. It’s the strangest thing but I missed you more that night and loved you more than usual. Isn’t that strange. That Jack Carson show is on again. He’s in a plane sitting in a bomb bay, or on it or whatever you do in a bomb bay door. Anyway, Jack wanted {{to know what to do}} if the bomb bay doors opened. Teacher said pick out a nice German factory and don’t forget to go “bang” when you hit it. Gee, darling, I love you so much. I wish we were together tonight and every night. Gee, honey, I hope you get that night flying over with soon. You’ll be so tired if you don’t try to get as much rest as you can before we come down. When do you start on your night cross countries? How many do you have? On those x countries, honey, do you fly more than four hours? I love the way you tell me that you’re going to try to call me and then you never call when you plan to + besides I always get the letters days after you’ve called. I’m so glad that you’re going to get the rings, honey. I wasn’t looking forward to picking them out at all. Oh, don’t forget I wear 3 ½. I had the engagement ring 3 34 / 4 but it’s too big and slides all around – 3 ½ was what he wanted me to have but I never take advice. Have to find out for myself. We don’t have wedding invitations, honey, but we will have announcements. So if you’ll be a good little angel and sit down and make out a list of all your friends that you’d like to tell you’re married, it will help no end. That’s a pretty big order, I know but about how many people would you like to send them to? Give me a rough idea. Not too rough but a good guess. Overestimate rather than underestimate- they’ll probably be millions because I can think of millions off hand. Gee, darling, I wish you were still at Stewart Field- that stationary brings back memories- wasn’t it wonderful when you were getting home every weekend? We were so lucky, hon, to have so much time together. You cost me no end of money lately with all this writing- Because at this point I’m all out of envelopes again. Don’t have any idea of how I’ll mail tis. Yes, honey, that’s the way I figured it out. Texas just should have horses- It sounds very logical. Remember the Rodeo? I hope that we can find some horses because I love riding so. We still haven’t gone together. Every weekend it gets colder + colder or snows or something and I don’t go maybe next weekend. Gee, darling, I wish I could get a sunburn before the wedding. It would look so nice with a white dress. How many hours do you have now, honey? Charlotte’s definitely coming down as you probably know by now. I’m so glad because I wanted someone I knew to be there. What did you do about the rooms honey? Did you change the reservations? What did you get? They’re going to get mighty tired of your changing our reservations all the times. We’d all like to be together if possible. If they have a double bed + a single in one room that would be all right. Charlotte and I could sleep on a windowsill. Honestly, honey, you and weather- It’s really pitiful. I do wish you’d carry a thermometer around with you for a few hours and find out the temperature is. Do you think the nights will stay real cool? My fur coat, haven’t worn it since you left. Gee, how exciting, a June bride by temperature. Honestly, what a wedding! Golly, nothing normal or usual ever happens to us. If you go over from the West Coast, darling, can I be with you in California until you go over? Then maybe I could study in California for a while and work in a B- 29 factory and do something to help you. I wouldn’t mind doing anything if it would help bring you home sooner. Honey, there isn’t much change of your going to Europe honey, is there? I wish they’d send you to England. At least you get home once in a while there. Well, honey 24 weeks will be over in about the end of August of the beginning of September. And you were the one who gave me the idea that you’d be in combat before October, honey. That’s one thing, honey, don’t try to keep anything from one for fear that I’ll worry or anything like that. Maybe I will to a certain extent but I’d be too busy being happy in the time that we had to worry about when you were going over. But, as you said, that’s a long way off, honey and we’ll think about that later. Gee, honey, in the movies they always think of so many ways to tell each other how much they love each other but I never can- Aught to change my writers- get new ideas. But I do love you so, darling. Someday, maybe, you’ll know how much. Every once in a while I just can’t believe that it’s happening to us. You’re so wonderful, honey and it just seems too wonderful to believe. Golly, March 11 th will certainly be some day for you. Getting your wings and married in the same day- within a few hours, too. I have to keep writing because I don’t have any envelope, I didn’t think so this will go on indefinitely, on second thought I’d better not- Have a few real tiny envelopes. Golly, darling, imagine us getting married. I still can’t believe it. It’s marvelous to be in love with you. You’re so wonderful and sweet. Did you get the rings yet honey? Don’t forget to tell me when you do. Oh, honey, please tell me about the scotch. I’ve got to know soon, honey or it will be too late to get any. May go to the movies with Daddy tomorrow night but I’ll write no matter how short it is. I love you more than anything in the world. I’ll love you with all my heart. Always, Dottie [Translation ends...|$|E
