5000|$|Blondel's theorem, {{named after}} its discoverer, French {{electrical}} engineer André Blondel, {{is the result}} of his attempt to simplify both the measurement of electrical energy and the validation of such measurements. The result is a simple rule that specifies the minimum number of <b>watt-hour</b> <b>meters</b> required to measure the consumption of energy in any system of electrical conductors. The theorem states that the power provided to a system of N conductors is equal to the algebraic sum of the power measured by N watt-meters. The N watt-meters are separately connected such that each one measures the current level in one of the N conductors and the potential level between that conductor and a common point. In a further simplification, if that common point is located on one of the conductors, that conductor's meter can be removed and only N-1 meters are required. An electrical energy meter is a watt-meter whose measurements are integrated over time, thus the theorem applies to <b>watt-hour</b> <b>meters</b> as well. [...] Blondel wrote a paper on his results that was delivered to the International Electric Congress held in Chicago in 1893.

The major advantage of using this technology is that not much additional works are required to install the PLC system, which means no extra installation of communication circuits.

Upton had just finished a year of graduate studies with Helmholtz in Germany after obtaining his M.S. from Princeton. Helmholtz had recommended Upton to Edison as a man with good theoretical skills who might be just the type of assistant Edison was seeking. Edison was largely self-educated. He was brimming over with ideas but needed someone with advanced mathematical skills who could do calculations and research the scientific literature to help solve intractable problems. Despite his inveterate suspicion of academic scientists, Edison found Upton highly engaging and quite useful. They worked together on many key inventions such as the incandescent lamp, the <b>watt-hour</b> <b>meter,</b> the parallel circuit distribution grid and the new constant voltage dynamo. Upton was of crucial importance to Edison in the design of Edison's power plant and distribution system put into service at the Pearl Street generating station in Lower Manhattan on September 4, 1882. Upton published articles in Scribner's Monthly and Scientific American. Since 1958, the Princeton University has had the Francis Upton Graduate Fellowships. In 1890, Upton patented the first electric fire alarm and detector along with a Mr. Fernando J.

Procedures for testing energy usage and usage profiles of copiers are needed to make valid comparisons between machines and to determine overall energy use and potential energy savings. In this paper, the authors present a method to analyze the energy use and usage profiles of copiers. This method is determined through long-term measurements from a <b>Watt-hour</b> <b>meter</b> connected to the copier and by measuring light flashes from the copier. Energy use from the copier can also be estimated by using a test procedure developed by Dandridge. Results from using the long term monitoring methods will be presented for several different sized copiers, and compared to the estimated energy use derived from the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) method. After summarizing these results, the authors determine criteria for a program to recognize energy-efficient copiers.
