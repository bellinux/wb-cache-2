30|$|The major {{challenge}} {{in this context}} is of course the necessity to adjust the resources of the jobcentres to accommodate to the larger inflow of unemployed that follows from fall in employment. There are indications that the jobcentres have faced severe difficulties in meeting the deadlines. Thus in January 2010 only 58 percent of the <b>insured</b> <b>unemployed</b> started activation in time. For young unemployed aged less than 30 years this was the case for only 42 percent (Arbejderbevægelsens Erhvervsråd, 2010 b).|$|E
30|$|When {{the reform}} was decided in May 2010, the {{expectation}} among policy-makers was that unemployment would gradually decline towards 2012. However this hope was not fulfilled. As a response the new Government postponed {{the implementation of}} the reform by extending the duration of unemployment benefits for <b>insured</b> <b>unemployed</b> by half a year for all unemployed, who would have exhausted their unemployment benefits {{in the second half of}} 2012. However, this moratorium only delayed the date, when large groups lose their right to unemployment insurance to the beginning of 2013.|$|E

50|$|Public sector {{employment}} (full-time and part-time) {{has been}} relatively steady at more than 800,000 a year this first decade, making up around 38% of total full-time (28% of full-time and part-time) employment, whereas private sector employment has risen by over 300,000 since the 1990s to slightly over 2 million in 2007 (full-time and part-time). With the information based partly on payments to the Arbejdsmarkedets Tillægspension pension fund of all employees and <b>insured</b> but <b>unemployed</b> members of an unemployment fund in Denmark, full-time employment is calculated at over 2.3 million persons {{in the third quarter}} of 2007. The increase in the fourth quarter of 2007 from a year ago in the number of employed persons was 1.0% and the amount of hours worked was 2.9% higher.|$|R
30|$|Since 2009 the {{municipalities}} {{have been}} responsible for governing the labour market policy towards all types of unemployed and sick-listed. This indicated a change from a system where the <b>insured</b> <b>unemployed</b> were governed by the state. The new system implies that all unemployed are handled by one authority – the so-called one-stop shops. This system has the apparent advantage of being simple and it benefits from economies of scale, but it also implies that unemployed eligible for unemployment insurance are handled by the same authority that provides assistance to unemployed on social assistance.|$|E
40|$|We {{develop and}} {{estimate}} a non-stationary job search model {{to evaluate a}} scheme that monitors job search effort and sanctions <b>insured</b> <b>unemployed</b> whose effort is deemed insuffcient. The model reveals that such schemes provide incentives to the unemployed to front-load search effort prior to monitoring. This causes the job finding rate to increase above the post sanction level. After validating the model both internally and externally, we conclude that the scheme is effective in raising the job finding rate with minor wage losses. A basic cost-benefit analysis demonstrates that welfare losses for the unemployed are compensated by net efficiency gains for public authorities and society.

40|$|This paper {{measures}} {{the impact of}} labor market policies (LMPs) on regular employment. Contrary to previous empirical studies, we conduct an econometric analysis based on sound theoretical foundations. The specification {{is based on an}} equilibrium job search model where LMPs affect tightness on the labor market. The impacts of a comprehensive set of LMPs on the regular employment rate and on wages are jointly estimated. Taking care of the endogeneity of LMPs, our results for Belgium indicate that unemployment benefits have a positive, yet small, impact on wages and a negative one on the employment rate. The rate of sanctions has a small negative effect on wages. Their impact on the employment rate is however negative. This can be understood if the efficiency of the sanctioned in the matching process is sufficiently lower than the one of the <b>insured</b> <b>unemployed.</b> Training programmes have a small negative effect on wages and a small positive one on employment. Our analysis also shows that the results can be sensitive to the choice made about the exogeneity of LMPs...|$|E
50|$|Maryport {{became a}} ghost town. The {{government}} declared West Cumberland a ‘Special Area' but, by 1933, 57.3% of the town's <b>insured</b> workforce was <b>unemployed.</b> 1,684 men {{were out of}} work. Maryport was “for the most part, living on public funds” In 1936 twenty unemployed men marched from Maryport to join the Jarrow Crusade to London. Known as the Maryport Marchers, {{they were joined by}} two marchers from Cleator Moor and two marchers from Frizington. The Maryport Marchers Council organised this.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the great}} {{achievements}} of the National Health Insurance Law in 1995 was that practically all the Israeli population was insured and thus entitled to the services included in the 'health basket'. Nevertheless, as of 2016, there are roughly 250,000 non-tourists that stay in Israel for long periods that are not entitled to {{the benefits of the}} National Health Insurance Law. About 100,000 of them are foreign workers who entered Israel legally and have a mandatory private health insurance that is paid by their employer. Another 100,000 are people entered Israel legally (as tourists or as foreign workers) but became illegal residents after overstaying their visas. The remaining 50,000 are work immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees, mainly from Eritrea and Sudan, who entered Israel illegally through the Egyptian border. For those illegal residents that are working full-time, there is a mandatory health insurance by the employer. This insurance is limited as it is dependent on the continued work and payments subtracted from salary, thus becoming ineffective and practically expires as the <b>insured</b> becomes <b>unemployed</b> from health reasons.|$|R
40|$|In June 1995, the Swedish {{parliament}} {{decided to}} cut the replacement rate in unemployment insurance from 80 percent to 75 percent, a change that took effect on January 1, 1996. This paper examines how this change affected job finding rates among <b>unemployed</b> <b>insured</b> individuals. To identify {{the effect of the}} policy we exploit a qasiexperimental feature of the benefit cut: {{only a fraction of the}} unemployed was affected by the reduction in replacement rates. We compare the evolution of job finding rates before and after the reform among those affected and those not affected. Our estimates suggest that the reform caused an increase in the transition rate of roughly 10 percent. There is also evidence of anticipatory behavior among the unemployed; the effects of the reform seem to operate several months before its actual implementation in January 1996.

40|$|This paper explores whether {{reemployment}} bonuses [...] cash {{payments made}} to <b>insured</b> <b>unemployed</b> workers who find reemployment quickly [...] have the unintended consequence of displacing {{workers who are}} not covered by the bonus program. We develop two partial equilibrium matching models of the labor market, patterned after the work of Diamond (1982), Mortensen (1982), and Pissarides (1984). In the first model, wages are assumed exogenous, in the second endogenous. In both, we find that the direct substitution of covered for uncovered workers (which constitutes displacement) is countered by two offsetting effects: a gross job creation effect, which results from thee increased search effort of covered workers; and a relatively small rivalry effect, in which uncovered workers search harder because of the increased difficulty they face in finding jobs. Both models suggest that, on net, the displacement effect is small to nonexistent.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the National Confederation of Employers' Organisations (N. C. E. O.), and its {{attitude towards the}} unemployment problem between the Wars. Chapter 1 deals with the origins {{and the development of}} the Confederation. Founded in 1919, the N. C. E. O. specialised in employers' labour and social interests, and on both subjects, it emerged as a recognised political force. For the Confederation, however, unemployment provided a meeting place for the politics of work and the politics of social welfare. Chapter 2 {{examines the}} N. C. E. O. 's attitude towards the prevention and reduction of unemployment between the Wars. Although it was prepared initially to collaborate with the Government and the trade unions in backing direct measures to tackle unemployment, the N. C. E. O. eventually lost interest. From 1925 until the mid 1930 's it argued that unemployment was mainly a function of a rigid wage structure and high standards of State social welfare. In particular, it directed criticism against Government spending on the maintenance of the unemployed. Chapters 3 and 4 deal with the N. C. E. O. 's attitude towards the unemployment insurance scheme during the 1920 's. The Confederation wanted a low-benefit, low-cost scheme, which would preserve the distinctions between wage-earners and the unemployed and minimise the financial responsibilities of employers. This objective was pursued in politics, but with limited success. Chapter 5 examines the N. C. E. O. 's attitude towards the Poor Law and public assistance during the same period. The Confederation wanted to separate the <b>insured</b> <b>unemployed</b> and transfer the long-term workless to the public assistance authorities, and it argued that this should be done in conjunction with a general reorganisation of poor law relief. Chapter 6 deals with the N. C. E. O. 's role in the debate on the unemployed after 1929. It played a prominent part in the controversy over the unemployment insurance scheme in 1931, and it was actively involved in the political debate which preceded the introduction of the Unemployment Act in 1934. During these years political opinion favoured the N. C. E. O. 's views on the unemployed, and to some extent, these views were recognised by the 1934 Act. The thesis concludes that the N. C. E. O. was an important employers' organisation. Although it exercised little direct influence over Government unemployment policy, it helped to translate ideas about unemployment and the unemployed and shape the political context in which certain policies were devised and implemented...|$|E
40|$|Active {{labor market}} {{policies}} {{have a long}} tradition in Norway, and since early the 1990 s, conditional activation policies have increasingly become a core component {{in the provision of}} social assistance. The primary aim of such policies is to (re) integrate social assistance recipients into the ordinary labor market, and the strategies argued to be best suited for doing so have shifted since the formal enactment in the 1991 Act of Social Assistance. The 6 th principle in ILO recommendation 202 urges member states to respect rights and dignity of minimum income recipients. While drawing on this principle, the purpose of this thesis is to address experiences of dignity among social assistance recipients required to participate in non-standardized activation measures. The research is located in a context where the activation policy over the last decade has undergone both discursive and practical developments. These changes have facilitated new, standardized, policies based in a social investment perspective, which differs from the 1990 s ‘work-for-benefit’ focused policies. By applying qualitative methods this study aims to explore how those who have their social assistance benefit conditioned upon participation in ‘work-for-benefit’ activation experience dignity. The role of new policies, which my focus group is excluded from, is explored as a dimension affecting these experiences. A subsidiary aim is to discuss how the arrival of new standardized activation policies may have impacted the social divisions of activation. The main findings of the study, derived from a thematic analysis of interviews with six participants in two different ‘work-for-benefit’ measures, suggests that strict conditionality, lack of user-involvement and agency, low and unpredictable economical compensation, and content in work assignments, are the most significant factors affecting their experiences of dignity. In addition does the existence of other offerings, accessed by only a few, {{play an important role in}} perceived dignity. Findings from interviews combined with a review of the activation policy points, furthermore, towards blurred distinctions in the old divisions between <b>insured</b> and uninsured <b>unemployed,</b> thus, challenging the traditional hierarchies within public welfare while facilitating new ones...|$|R
