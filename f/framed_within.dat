5|$|Representative {{of the new}} {{historical}} perspective is the 2003 biography by Pauline Croft. Reviewer John Cramsie summarises her findings:Croft's overall assessment of James is appropriately mixed. She recognises his good intentions in matters like Anglo-Scottish union, his openness to different points of view, and his agenda of a peaceful foreign policy within his kingdoms' financial means. His actions moderated frictions between his diverse peoples. Yet he also created new ones, particularly by supporting colonisation that polarised the crown's interest groups in Ireland, obtaining insufficient political benefit with his open-handed patronage, an unfortunate {{lack of attention to}} the image of monarchy (particularly after the image-obsessed regime of Elizabeth), pursuing a pro-Spanish foreign policy that fired religious prejudice and opened the door for Arminians within the English church, and enforcing unpalatable religious changes on the Scottish Kirk. Many of these criticisms are <b>framed</b> <b>within</b> a longer view of James' reigns, including the legacy – now understood to be more troubled – which he left Charles I.|$|E

25|$|The central Roman Catholic Church is the Church of Our Lady Mother of Divine Grace, of the Catholic Parish of Raheny. The building, {{completed}} in 1962, {{was designed by}} Peppard and Duffy architects, {{at the behest of}} John Charles McQuaid to accommodate the burgeoning flock. The Church opened Sunday, July 22, 1962. The main entrance is <b>framed</b> <b>within</b> a large triangle inset with numerous smaller triangles, recalling traditional motifs from Romanesque Irish churches. The facade and the bell-tower are built with green limestone.|$|E
25|$|What {{is common}} {{throughout}} all the {{editions of the}} Nights is the initial frame story of the ruler Shahryār and his wife Scheherazade and the framing device incorporated throughout the tales themselves. The stories proceed from this original tale; some are <b>framed</b> <b>within</b> other tales, while others begin and end of their own accord. Some editions contain {{only a few hundred}} nights, while others include 1,001 or more. The bulk of the text is in prose, although verse is occasionally used for songs and riddles and to express heightened emotion. Most of the poems are single couplets or quatrains, although some are longer.|$|E
25|$|Overall, {{this view}} {{on the need for}} more {{stakeholder}} involvement can be <b>framed</b> <b>within</b> the movement in environmental governance calling for a shift from traditional ways of government to governance. The Climate & Development Knowledge Network is funding a research project that aims to help the GCF Board, by analysing how best to allocate resources among countries. The project will research and present four case studies of how federal or central government money is presently distributed to sub-national entities. Chosen for the diversity in their underlying political systems, these are: China, India, Switzerland, and the USA.|$|E

25|$|The genetic {{difference}} between domestic and wild populations can be <b>framed</b> <b>within</b> two considerations. The first distinguishes between domestication traits that are presumed {{to have been}} essential at {{the early stages of}} domestication, and improvement traits that have appeared since the split between wild and domestic populations. Domestication traits are generally fixed within all domesticates and were selected during the initial episode of domestication, whereas improvement traits are present only in a proportion of domesticates, though they may be fixed in individual breeds or regional populations. A second issue is whether traits associated with the domestication syndrome resulted from a relaxation of selection as animals exited the wild environment or from positive selection resulting from intentional and unintentional human preference. Some recent genomic studies on the genetic basis of traits associated with the domestication syndrome have shed light on both of these issues.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, {{with the}} 1960s Army and Carabinieri reorganization, the XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade was {{established}} {{directly under the}} General Command, in order {{to cope with the}} internal territorial defence needs. The establishment of the new Brigade was in order to adjust the organization of the Battalions and of cavalry units both for strictly military tasks, and those related to the protection of public order. The aim was to ensure Carabinieri Battalions the availability of all elements necessary {{to be in a position}} to act in isolation and overcome considerable resistance without having to rely on the competition of other Army Corps or other Armed Forces, to ensure Battalions speed of movement and concentration in large sectors of foreseeable use and a constant high training level. The establishment of the XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade was decided also due to the wider Italian Army needs to have only one point of contact to deal with equipment, training and readiness of Carabinier Battalions, <b>framed</b> <b>within</b> military defence system.|$|E

In early 1981, Flowers signed to Chrysalis Records for European, Japanese, UK and U.S. releases; they had to change their name due to legal restrictions and to prevent confusion with a Scottish group The Flowers.

500|$|Within the novel, the Law forbids {{violence}} between {{the inhabitants of}} the Place. Despite its seemingly unyielding nature, it is in fact broken several times, though always with [...] "good reason". In the story [...] "His Mate", Lad meets and later must win the heart of his mate, Lady. Lad is clearly [...] "enthralled" [...] by the adult Lady's sexual appeal. As Terhune seems reluctant to note the facts of canine mating, Lady is never stated to actually go into heat. Instead the relationship is <b>framed</b> <b>within</b> the context of a [...] "human courtly love triangle" [...] when the [...] "showy" [...] Knave comes to the Place and Lady forgets Lad and fawns on the new arrival. When Lady is believed to have destroyed a beloved mounted bald eagle, the master breaks the rules against violence and intends to beat her. Lad, in turn, breaks the rules of perfect obedience and growls, becoming the object of punishment and taking the beating in her stead. At the end of the story, when the master realizes he was mistaken, he apologizes to Lad for beating the wrong dog. Despite the novel's overall theme of nonviolence, the master's [...] "unreasonable attachment to the bird" [...] becomes the motivation for his [...] "cruelty toward the helpless dogs", yet Lad perceives the Master's actions as [...] "reasonable and functional". Though the numerous tenets of the Law forbid violence in various forms, if the dogs harm something of sentimental value it is deemed justifiable to treat them with [...] "any amount of violence." [...] This change is seen as reflecting a lack of maturity in the Master, and his having a [...] "childish fixation on having his own way", showing a desire to have control and order over that which can never be perfectly ordered: everyday life. Throughout many of the stories, a consistent theme is the Master's imposition of will, behind which is the [...] "blind rage of a child who cannot get exactly what he wants." ...|$|E

MEF is defined as a capability based defence and force level that can guarantee the attainment of immediate strategic defence interests, where the procurement priority is given to the improvement of minimum defence strength and/or the replacement of outdated main weapon systems/equipments. To achieve this aim, MEF had been restructured into a series of 3 strategic programmes with timeframes from 2010 to 2014, 2015 to 2019 and 2020 to 2024 as well as spending of up the 1.5 - 2% of the GDP.|$|E
