5000|$|Production of Roquefort cheese entails [...] "4,500 {{people who}} herd special ewes on 2,100 farms {{producing}} milk ... in a carefully defined oval grazing area across the Larzac Plain {{and up and}} down nearby hills and valleys." [...] Total production in 2008 of about 19,000 tons was reported. The proportion of Roquefort exported to the United States remained small, only 450 tons out of 3,700 in total exports. Spain, with purchases of 1,000 tons, was by far the largest foreign customer. In early 2009, Susan Schwab, the then-outgoing US Trade Representative, announced a 300% tariff on the cheese, apparently the highest level by far of any in the package of tariffs placed on dozens of European luxury goods in response to a European ban on <b>hormone-treated</b> US <b>beef.</b> The tariff was suspended several months later as the US and EU settled the dispute.|$|R
50|$|Impact of Consumer Pressure on {{adherence}} to the SPS Agreement. Some commentators pose that the WTO’s assumption that trade liberalisation enhances consumer welfare, {{has resulted in the}} SPS Agreement being ill-equipped to deal with trade restrictions put in place by governments responding to protectionist pressure from consumers. This was most noticeable in the Beef Hormones Dispute where, although the science pointed to the relative safety of the growth hormones in question, European consumers pressured governments to ban the import of <b>hormone-treated</b> <b>beef.</b>|$|E

[...] Considered by his supporters to be non-violent, Bové designed this protest against new US restrictions on importing Roquefort cheese and other products, which were harming the farmers who live from these products, and to raise awareness about McDonald's' use of <b>hormone-treated</b> <b>beef.</b> Bové was sentenced to three months' imprisonment for his role; he was imprisoned for 44 days and released early on 1 August 2002.|$|E
50|$|In November 2004, the EU {{requested}} WTO consultations, {{claiming that}} the United States should remove its retaliatory measures since the EU has removed the measures found to be WTO-inconsistent in the original case. In 2005, the EU initiated new WTO dispute settlement proceedings against the United States and Canada, and a March 2008 panel report cited fault with all three parties (EU, United States, and Canada) on various substantive and procedural aspects of the dispute. In October 2008, the WTO Appellate Body issued a mixed ruling that allows for continued imposition of trade sanctions on the EU by the United States and Canada, but also allows the EU to continue its ban on imports of <b>hormone-treated</b> <b>beef.</b>|$|E
50|$|Another {{prominent}} SPS {{case is the}} <b>hormone-treated</b> <b>beef</b> case. In 1996, the United States and Canada challenged {{before the}} WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) a number of EU directives prohibiting the importation and sale of meat and meat products treated with certain growth hormones. The complainants alleged that the EU directives violated, among other things, several provisions of the SPS Agreement. The EU contended {{that the presence of}} the banned hormones in food may present a risk to consumers' health and that, as a consequence, the directives were justified under several WTO provisions authorizing the adoption of trade-restrictive measures that are necessary to protect human health. In 1997 and 1998, the WTO adjudicating bodies admitted USA and Canada claims and invited the EU to bring the directives into conformity with WTO law before end of May 1999. EU did not comply and the DSB authorized the USA and Canada to take countermeasures against the EU. The countermeasures took the form of increased custom duties applied by the USA and Canada on certain EU products, including the notorious Roquefort cheese. In 2004, while the ban on hormone-treated meat was still in place, the EU initiated before the DSB new proceedings seeking the lifting of the countermeasures applied by the USA and Canada. EU alleged that it had collected new scientific data evidencing that the banned hormones may cause harm to consumers. According to the EU, the new scientific data provides sufficient ground for the ban on hormones, which may no more be sanctioned by the countermeasures imposed by the USA and Canada. As of January 2007, the proceedings initiated by the EU were still pending.|$|E

40|$|AN ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF FOOD SAFETY ISSUES FOLLOWING THE SPS AGREEMENT: LESSONS FROM THE HORMONES DISPUTE Sallie James The long-running feud {{between the}} US and the EU over trade in <b>hormone-treated</b> <b>beef</b> {{was the first}} case under the Uruguay Round's SPS Agreement to be disputed {{formally}} at the WTO. It provides {{a classic example of}} how cultural differences with respect to food attributes have the potential to hamper trade and to challenge WTO agreements designed to limit trade disruptions, especially when scientific evidence is limited or spurious. After outlining the legal arguments used by the parties to the Hormones dispute, simple economic models are used to represent the EU beef market and examine the effects of the <b>hormone-treated</b> <b>beef</b> ban and its removal. The implications for the practical implementation of the SPS Agreement are then explored.

40|$|International audienceThe first {{commercial}} dispute settled by the WTO under the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement concerned the disagreement between the European Communities and the United States over the European import ban on meat and meat products derived from cattle to which hormones have been administered for growth promotion purposes. The {{purpose of this}} paper is twofold: First, we analyse the WTO's approach to the notion of risk in the use of hormones and the role this played in reaching its decision to declare the EC ban on <b>hormone-treated</b> <b>beef</b> imports inconsistent with its obligations under the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement. Second, we discuss the way in which the precautionary principle has been dealt with in the settlement of this conflict. We then show how this dispute has paved the way to a debate on the concept of protectionism to be applied in this kind of dispute.

40|$|Precaution” is {{increasingly}} {{accepted as a}} basis for governmental policy in the areas of public health and environment on both the domestic and international levels. A precautionary perspective counsels action to avert danger or threats in situations of scientific uncertainty or incomplete information. Precautionary approaches find expression in internationally harmonized formulations as non-binding exhortations, binding treaties, and meta-level principles. Precaution is a particular challenge to free trade agreements, whose purpose is to eliminate unjustified barriers to trade. In that context, precaution as a justification for a challenged governmental measure may appear to be nothing more than a pretext for protectionism. This article traces the treatment of precaution in the jurisprudence of the World Trade Organization, and particularly under the Uruguay Round Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Standards. From this perspective, the piece analyzes a number of controversial disputes, including those over <b>hormone-treated</b> <b>beef</b> and genetically modified food and crops, and makes recommendations for an alternative treatment of this important question by the WTO’s Appellate Body...|$|E
40|$|The transatlantic {{complaints}} over <b>hormone-treated</b> <b>beef</b> and {{genetically modified}} organisms before the World Trade Organisation (WTO) seem to confirm two separate but related conventional wisdoms about the transatlantic economic relationship: that it is highly conflictual and {{that many of the}} conflicts are rooted in profoundly different approaches to regulation. This article argues that neither of the two conventional wisdoms is accurate. Rather, it contends that they are products of two, compounding analytical shortcomings: one methodological, one empirical. The methodological shortcoming takes the form of an implicit selection bias. While WTO complaints are high profile they are rare and extreme examples; it is, therefore, unsound to generalise from them to the regulatory relationship as a whole. The empirical shortcoming has to do with neither the beef hormones nor the GMO dispute demonstrating what it is purported to. The article thus serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of relying on obvious cases and the need to question whether evidence really does support a prevailing popular narrative...|$|E
40|$|There {{have been}} a number of high profile food safety {{disputes}} in trade over the past decade. These include the widely publicized case at the World Trade Organization between the US and EU over <b>hormone-treated</b> <b>beef.</b> In particular, consumers in some industrialized countries have expressed concern over the health implications of consuming beef produced with antibiotics and other artificial supplements. Developing countries are affected in a significant way in how these concerns are addressed, as well as the balance between risk and safety reflected in how standards are set. This paper examines the impact of drug residue standards on trade in beef and the trade effect of setting harmonized international standards. We find that if international standards set by Codex were followed in antibiotics, global trade in beef would rise by over $ 3. 2 billion. Among other developing countries, South African exports would rise by $ 160 million, Brazil's by $ 200 million, and Argentina's by over $ 300 million.

40|$|Growing {{concern over}} health risks {{associated}} with food products {{is at the forefront}} of trade policy debate. At the heart of this debate is the"precautionary principle,"which holds that precautions should be taken against health, safety, and environmental risks even whenscience has not established direct cause-and-effect relationships [...] as with, for example, the EUropean ban on <b>hormone-treated</b> <b>beef.</b> The authors quantify the impact on food exports from African countries of new EUropean Union standards for aflatoxins, structurally related toxic compounds that contaminate certain foods and lead to the production of acute liver carcinogens in the human body. The authors estimate the impact of changes in differing levels of such protection based on the EU standards (and suggested by international standards) for 15 EUropean countries and 9 African countries between 1989 and 1998. The results suggest that implementation of the EU's new aflatoxin standards will significantly hurt African exports to EUrope of nuts, cereals, and dried fruits, which are highly sensitive to the aflatoxin standards. The EU standards would reduce health risks by only about 1. 4 deaths per billion a year but would cut African exports by 64 percent, or $ 670 million, compared with their level under international standards.

40|$|International audienceIn 2009, the United States {{imposed a}} 300 % tariff on Roquefort cheese during EU-US trade {{negotiations}} regarding European imports of <b>hormone-treated</b> <b>beef.</b> This {{decision by the}} American administration reaffirmed the international renown of this product, one of the symbols of French gastronomy. Ever since the 17 th century, this cheese has borne {{the name of a}} little village in the southern region of the Aveyron department. Its location along the edges of the Causse du Larzac, some 800 km from Paris and 200 km from Montpellier, was a major constraint if not a downright obstacle to international recognition. Paradoxically, {{in the latter half of}} the 19 th century, Roquefort was the first cheese to enter the industrial era through the establishment of a national and international market. These three aspects had a tremendous influence on the creation of a most unique case in the food and dairy industry. With Roquefort's commercial success in the middle of the 19 th century came several questions: How to meet demand when the manufacturing process was dependent on significant constraints and reliant on agriculture-based production? How to carry weight in the market? How to set Roquefort apart from other cheeses and succeed in winning over probable consumers with a pungent cheese whose characteristic smell pervades the entire village devoted to its affinage? These questions were an expression of the constant back-and-forth interaction between commerce, industry and agriculture, agriculture and commerce, and effectively bound consumers to farmers. The affinage business lay at this junction between the global and local levels, and had the ability to provide solutions. Paradoxically, it was not a company but the village itself that came onto the international scene, representing the entire Roquefort trade. This retreat of the companies behind a product and a village name was no chance event, but the result of a collective effort made under the pressure of local, commercial and global forces. In this paper, we propose to explain why and when the companies succeeded in reaching a mutual agreement, as well as the terms and extent of this agreement. The definition of Roquefort cheese according to its rootedness in a particular territory has proven successful in resolving some of the tensions. Today, Roquefort, which has been distinguished by an AOC label for cheese since 1925, is ripened in a single village, with the supply of ewe's milk being confined to a certain "radius". This model is accepted internationally...|$|E
