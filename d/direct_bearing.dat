It is further assumed that the sensing graph is inherently directed and a common reference frame is not known {{to all of the}} agents.

A greenhouse experiment was conducted {{with the objective of}} developing a screening technique to evaluate lowland rice genotypes for zinc use efficiency. Ten lowland (Oryza sativa L.) genotypes were tested at low (0 mg Zn kg- 1) and high (10 mg Zn kg- 1) zinc levels applied to an Inceptisol. Genotypes differed significantly in grain yield and its components. Based on the grain yield efficiency index, genotypes were classified as efficient and inefficient. The most Zn efficient genotypes were: Metica 1, Epagri 108, CNA 7550, and CNA 8619. The most inefficient genotype was CNA 8319. The moderately efficient genotypes were: Javae, Rio Formoso, CNA 7556, and CNA 7857. The screening method used for Zn use efficiency is simple and does not require plant analysis.

These two bands were chosen because of their universal availability to amateur radio licensees in all countries. Each band requires different radio equipment for transmission and reception, and {{requires the use of}} different radio direction finding skills. Radio direction finding equipment for eighty meters, an HF band, is relatively easy to design and inexpensive to build. Bearings taken on eighty meters can be very accurate. Competitors on an eighty-meter course must use bearings to determine the locations of the transmitters and choose the fastest route through the terrain to visit them. Two meters, a VHF band, requires equipment that is relatively more complicated to design and more expensive to build. Radio signals on two meters are more affected by features of the terrain. Competitors on a two-meter course must learn to differentiate between accurate, <b>direct</b> <b>bearings</b> to the source of the radio signal and false bearings resulting from reflections of the signal off hillsides, ravines, buildings, or fences.

40|$|The lexical causative is a {{prominent}} phenomenon in Archaic Chinese, which relates to {{many aspects of}} the language, including its morphology, syntax (particularly the subcategorization of verbs), semantics, and the interface between semantics and syntax. Moreover, its diachronic change is generally believed to have <b>direct</b> <b>bearings</b> on emergence of the V(erb) R(esultative) Construction - a widely discussed issue in Chinese historical grammar. Though there is now a substantial body of literature on this topic, previous research has been predominantly descriptive and taxonomic in nature, and limited to one aspect or another of the phenomenon. The present dissertation differs from earlier studies in that it provides a comprehensive treatment of the issue based on data from the Zuozhuan, and, drawing insights from Construction Grammar and recent research in lexical semantics and typology, prompts a new line of inquiry into Archaic Chinese syntax. It is argued that the lexical causative should be understood as the result of 'fusion' between verbs and two distinct constructions - Direct Causative Construction and Change Construction. Success of the fusion is determined by semantic properties of the constructions and verbs. A new markedness pattern based on the Typological Markedness Theory (Greenberg 1966; Croft 1990, 2001) is proposed to explain the relationships between relevant verbs and constructions. This markedness pattern not only provides a satisfactory account of the Zuozhuan data, but also appears to have cross-linguistic validity...|$|R
