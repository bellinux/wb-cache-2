50|$|After {{a lengthy}} period of {{restricted}} intermittent or no water exchange between the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean basin, approximately 5.33 million years ago, the Atlantic-Mediterranean connection was completely reestablished through the Strait of Gibraltar by the Zanclean flood, and has remained open ever since.

The strait is expected to close again as the African Plate moves northward relative to the Eurasian Plate, but on geological rather than human timescales.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate spatial and temporal patterns of limnological characteristics of the Rio das Pedras Reservoir (Billings Complex, São Bernardo do Campo, São Paulo – Brazil). Profile samples were taken at three stations during two periods (March and October, 2004). The variables analyzed were: temperature, electrical conductivity, pH, with multiparameter probe; concentration of ammonium, nitrite, nitrate, phosphate, orthosilicate, total phosphorus, chlorophyll-a and phaeophytin, by spectrophotometric method; dissolved oxygen by titrimetric method; beyond concentrations of total solids and suspended material. PCA (Principal Components Analyses) was applied for the statistical analyses. The temporal heterogeneity observed was a consequence of differences in temperature observed in the month of March, which generated thermal, chemical and biological stratification. The vertical spatial differences also resulted from the thermal stratification. The largest discrepancies in the limnological characteristics, in relation to the pattern of horizontal spatial distribution, were obtained in station 1, and are directly related to the influence of the <b>incoming</b> <b>waters</b> of the Billings reservoir. According to CONAMA 357 / 05, for the month of October, 2004, the waters of the reservoir were in accordance with Class 3. In March, the values for station 3 were below the standards established, indicating non-conformity with Class 3...|$|E

40|$|Pharmaceuticals {{that are}} found in marine {{ecosystems}} are a threatening environmental concern, which is known to harm both animal and plant life. One {{of the reasons for}} this problem is that the waste water treatment techniques are not optimized to clear waste water from its pharmaceuticals contain. In this master thesis four Swedish treatment wetlands were studied, and their ability to reduce numerous pharmaceuticals in waste water. The four treatment wetlands that were studied were those in Oxelösund, Trosa, Nynäshamn and Eskilstuna. Two ecotoxicological tests and chemical analysis were used. The ecotoxicological tests were performed on the copepod Nitocra spinipes and macro algae Ceramium tenuicorne, but the results were ambiguous and could not be related to the chemical analysis. The result from the chemical analysis showed that 50 - 70 % of the substances were reduced to some degree, and of which 15 % were almost completely reduced. In Nynäshamn’s wetland and Oxelösund’s wetland the pharmaceutical treatment were more efficient than in Trosa’s wetland and Eskilstuna’s wetland. This was probably due to the, at the time, more efficient biological activity. The pharmaceuticals that dominated the <b>incoming</b> <b>waters</b> to all the wetlands were more or less the same. On the contrary, substances were reduced to different degrees in the four wetlands. However, the reduction patterns for both Nynäshamn and Oxelösund were similar, which suggest that the same processes dominated in both wetlands. As the study was performed in cold winter conditions with bad oxygen supply it is likely that greater reduction would be obtained in warmer conditions...|$|E
40|$|During {{an annual}} cycle, flux rates of oxygen, nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, {{phosphate}} and silicate were measured in {{light and dark}} bell jars at three sites in Ria Formosa (Algarve, Portugal) enclosing either a natural macrophytic community (macroalgae on sand or mud, a seagrass bed of Zostera noltii) or bare sediments. The results are compared with a preceeding study in which the same bell jar technique has been applied in the Sylt-Rømø Bay of the northern Wadden Sea. Nitrate flux was mainly directed from the water column to the benthic communities in Ria Formosa, {{as well as in}} the Sylt-Rømø Bay. However, nitrate uptake was higher in the northern, more eutrophic study area. In Ria Formosa, nutrient concentrations were lower than in the Sylt-Rømø Bay possibly due to strong water exchange with Atlantic waters. High temperatures and strong insolation had a greater impact on nitrate fluxes in Ria Formosa than in the Sylt-Rømø Bay. Bioturbating macrofauna increased ammonium efflux in the Sylt- Rømø Bay while this effect was not as pronounced in the Ria Formosa study sites. Benthic phosphate uptake dominated in the Ria Formosa and was correlated to initial phosphate concentrations in <b>incoming</b> <b>waters.</b> At both study sites, oxygen and nutrient fluxes were correlated with temperature. Additionally, flux rates were strongly influenced by biotic components and levels of eutrophication. A literature survey showed that mainly in temperate regions, material fluxes increase with temperature, whereas in warmer areas, ammonium and phosphate fluxes between sediment and water were generally lower...|$|E
40|$|Total {{dissolved}} Zn and Zn speciation {{were investigated}} by cathodic stripping voltammetry (CSV) {{in the northeastern}} Indian Ocean and the Andaman Sea. Vertical distributions of total dissolved Zn concentration (CZn) in the northeastern Indian Ocean and the Andaman Sea reflect that the deep water from the Andaman Sea was rapidly replaced by <b>incoming</b> <b>waters</b> from the northeastern Indian Ocean across the sills and was homogenized by vertical mixing. In the Andaman Sea, CZn at the near surface, < 50 m in depth, ranged from 0. 33 nM to 1. 14 nM at the southernmost station, which is {{an order of magnitude}} higher than those at the northernmost station, 0. 03 – 0. 22 nM, where is in close proximity to the estuaries of the Irrawaddy and Salween rivers. However, the Si concentration in the near surface water, 16. 3 μM, was highest at the northernmost station of the Andaman Sea. In the northeastern Indian Ocean, only one sample was applied to estimate total ligand concentrations (CL) and conditional stability constants (〖K^'〗_(ZnL,Zn^(2 +))) for organic complexation of Zn. The CL and 〖K^'〗_(ZnL,Zn^(2 +)) in the northeastern Indian Ocean were 0. 5 nM and 10. 0, whereas those of the Andaman Sea were 0. 4 nM– 0. 9 nM and 9. 6 – 11. 4, respectively. We observed no clear relationship between chlorophyll a (Chl a) and CL in the Andaman Sea. Various sources of Zn complexing ligands might be derived in the Andaman Sea, not only from bacteria and phytoplankton, but also from the Irrawaddy–Salween rivers...|$|E

40|$|Lake {{stratification}} {{controls the}} cycling of dissolved matter within the water body. This {{is of particular}} interest in the case of meromictic lakes, where permanent density stratification of the deep water limits vertical transport, and a chemically different (reducing) milieu can be established. As a consequence, the geochemical setting and the mixing regime of a lake can stabilize each other mutually. We attempt a quantitative approach to the contribution of chemical reactions sustaining the density stratification. As an example, we chose the prominent case of iron meromixis in Waldsee near Doebern, a small lake that originated from near-surface underground mining of lignite. From a data set covering 4 years of monthly measured electrical conductivity profiles, we calculated summed conductivity as a quantitative variable reflecting the amount of electro-active substances in the entire lake. Seasonal variations followed the changing of the chemocline height. Coinciding changes of electrical conductivities in the monimolimnion indicated that a considerable share of substances, precipitated by the advancing oxygenated epilimnion, re-dissolved in the remaining anoxic deep waters and contributed considerably to the density stratification. In addition, we designed a lab experiment, in which we removed iron compounds and organic material from monimolimnetic waters by introducing air bubbles. Precipitates could be identified by visual inspection. Eventually, the remaining solutes in the aerated water layer looked similar to mixolimnetic Waldsee water. Due to its reduced concentration of solutes, this water became less dense and remained floating on nearly unchanged monimolimnetic water. In conclusion, iron meromixis as seen in Waldsee did not require two different sources of <b>incoming</b> <b>waters,</b> but the inflow of iron-rich deep groundwater and the aeration through the lake surface were fully sufficient for the formation of iron meromixis...|$|E
40|$|Lakes, {{both natural}} and {{artificial}} (reservoirs) are vital and strategic resources for life on our planet. At the same time, they are also highly vulnerable to human activities, {{especially if they are}} not properly preserved and used in a sustainable manner. These natural resources and their ecosystems have defined borders, {{while at the same time}} also strongly influenced by where they are located. Although there is a geographic limit between a lake ecosystem and neighbouring ecosystems, lakes are heavily influenced by the substances entering them in their <b>incoming</b> <b>waters.</b> Moreover, lakes are very complex systems influenced by many different factors, major ones being the materials dissolved in their waters, the climate of the region, energy exchanges with the atmosphere, the soil and the variety of organisms inhabit them, all of which are influenced by, and also influence, the lake system itself. This complexity means that when a lake is studied on the basis of a single discipline, it can often lead to misleading conclusions, or even incorrect results. Thus, the continuing scope of this World Lake Conference is to again bring together experts in the field of lake environments and habitats, with the underlying goal of establishing a basis for developing multidisciplinary solutions to multidisciplinary issues. Further, although multidisciplinary is a keyword in regard to this conference, different approaches and point of views also must be taken into account to address complex lake issues. Therefore, we are inviting not only scientists, but also resource managers, politicians, and lake basin stakeholders and users to the conference. The interactions among this diverse audience will result in a wider discussion, with the goal of connect a top-down approach to a bottom-up perspective to solving complex lake basin issues. Moreover, this event also would likely have a strong influence on young generations of researchers, managers and lake users, launching different didactic experiences for children and graduate students, and teach them how to focus on world lake issues and how to connect with others in a worldwide study network...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge {{that can}} be applied towards the {{diagnosis}} and prevention of Flounder Infectious Necrotizing Enteritis in summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus), caused by the bacterial pathogen Vibrio harveyi, are presented in this research. Biochemical profiles are insufficient to differentiate V. harveyi from other closely related species. Biochemical profiles can, however, be used in conjunction with 16 S ribosomal DNA sequencing to provide a reliable method for identifying V. harveyi. A monitoring program for V. harveyi and other potential bacterial pathogens in cultured juvenile summer flounder found that V. harveyi was the most abundant and commonly found bacterial species in juvenile summer flounder at a commercial hatchery during the summer months. Presence of V. harveyi in summer flounder was not necessarily associated with large-scale mortalities, which only occurred after transport of juvenile fish. Temperatures of 25 °C and transport stress resulted in highest mortalities in experimental infections of summer flounder with V. harveyi. The susceptibility to experimental infection by V. harveyi strain DN 01, originally isolated from diseased summer flounder, was assessed for several economically or environmentally important fish species in the Northeast US including tautog, black sea bass, Atlantic salmon, rainbow trout, and mummichog. Vibrio harveyi strain DN 01 was significantly more virulent to summer flounder than to the other species tested. A mutant strain of V. harveyi (SGM 1) was created that was partially impaired in its ability to grow on a variety of media, including media with flounder intestinal mucus as a sole carbon source. The mutant also showed lower proteolytic activity in culture supernatants than the wild type. In experimental infections, the mutant was shown to be attenuated, however, it was not shown to be protective against subsequent exposure of summer flounder to wild type V. harveyi DN 01. In summary, V. harveyi is a major bacterial pathogen of juvenile summer flounder, capable of causing mortalities in situations of stress. Management options include maintaining fish at temperatures at or near 18 °C, reducing stress during transport, and timing production runs or transport {{in order to avoid the}} peak abundance of V. harveyi in <b>incoming</b> <b>waters.</b> ...|$|E
