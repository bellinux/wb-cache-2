5|$|Almost all of Ukraine {{had been}} {{occupied}} by the Germans, and Khrushchev returned to his domain in late 1943 to find devastation. Ukraine's industry had been destroyed, and agriculture faced critical shortages. Even though millions of Ukrainians had been taken to Germany as workers or prisoners of war, there was insufficient housing for those who remained. One out of <b>every</b> <b>six</b> Ukrainians was killed in World War II.|$|E

5|$|Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) is {{a measure}} of the {{activity}} of a hurricane season. It is calculated by squaring the windspeed of a cyclone with at least tropical storm-force winds <b>every</b> <b>six</b> hours, summing the results, and dividing that total by 104. As a tropical cyclone does not have gale-force winds until it becomes a tropical storm, tropical depressions are not included in these tables. For all storms, ACE is given to three significant figures. The ACE in the east Pacific proper (140°W to North America) is given; the ACE in the central Pacific (the International Date Line to 140°W) is given in parentheses.|$|E
5|$|ArtWalk {{takes place}} {{approximately}} <b>every</b> <b>six</b> weeks on Saturday evenings throughout the year.

5|$|The April 15 eclipse was {{the first}} eclipse in a tetrad; that is, four {{consecutive}} total eclipses with no partial eclipses in between. There will be another eclipse <b>every</b> <b>six</b> lunar cycles during the tetrad – on October 8, 2014, April 4, 2015, and September 28, 2015. The lunar year series repeats after 12 cycles, or 354 days, causing a date shift {{when compared to the}} solar calendar. This shift means the Earth's shadow will move about 11 degrees west in each subsequent eclipse.|$|E

At the end of six years, each boat comes in for her 'full cycle docking', which involves completely refurbishing the submarine. During these dockings, the submarines are fitted with any enhancements or new technologies as part of the Collins Continuous Improvement Program (part of Defence procurement project SEA 1439).|$|E
5|$|The Court of Auditors {{was set up}} in 1975.

The Foreign Affairs Council (national foreign ministers) is however chaired by the Union's High Representative.|$|E

5|$|When a {{tropical}} depression intensifies into {{a tropical}} storm {{to the north of}} the Equator between the coastline of the Americas and 140°W, it will be named by the NHC. There are six lists of names which rotate <b>every</b> <b>six</b> years and begin with the letters A—Z used, skipping Q and U, with each name alternating between a male or a female name. The names of significant tropical cyclones are retired from the lists, with a replacement name selected at the next World Meteorological Organization's Hurricane Committee. If all of the names on a list are used, storms are named using the letters of the Greek alphabet.|$|E
5|$|ABA Games' sole developer, Kenta Cho, {{began writing}} {{games as a}} child during the 1980s using the NEC PC-6001 microcomputer, as there were few commercially {{available}} games. After leaving university, Cho contemplated professional games development but ultimately instead joined Toshiba to work in multimedia research and development. He continues to work full-time for Toshiba while running ABA Games as a hobby, working mainly on weekends. Cho is the sole contributor to ABA Games. Lacking musical training, he creates the soundtracks to his games using commercially available, pre-made samples. ABA Games releases a game approximately <b>every</b> <b>six</b> months, with {{the first three months}} spent creating prototypes and the latter three spent refining a finished version.|$|E
5|$|According to the Bermuda Weather Service, {{the islands}} of Bermuda {{experience}} a damaging tropical cyclone once <b>every</b> <b>six</b> to seven years, on average. Due to the small area of the island chain, landfalls and direct hits are rare. Strictly speaking, only nine landfalls have occurred during years included in the official Atlantic hurricane database, starting in 1851. When hurricanes Fay and Gonzalo struck Bermuda just days apart in October 2014, that season became the first to produce two landfalls. Two damaging storms impacted Bermuda in September 1899, but {{the center of the}} first storm narrowly missed the islands. Tropical cyclones, and their antecedent or remnant weather systems, have affected the territory in all seasons, most frequently in the late summer months. A study of recorded storms from 1609 to 1996 found that direct hits from hurricanes were most common in early September and late October, with an intervening relative lull creating two distinct 'seasons'.|$|E
