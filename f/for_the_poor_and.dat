40|$|The paper explores {{whether one}} of the largest {{programs}} in <b>the</b> world <b>for</b> women's empowerment and rural livelihoods, the Indira Kranti Patham in Andhra Pradesh, India, has {{had an impact on the}} economic and social wellbeing of households that participate in the program. The analysis usespanel data for 4, 250 households from two rounds of a survey conducted in 2004 and 2008 in five districts. Propensity score matching was used to construct control groups and outcomes are compared with differences-in-differences. There are two major impacts. First, the Indira Kranti Patham program increased participants' access to loans, which allowed them to accumulate some assets (livestock <b>and</b> durables <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> <b>and</b> nonfarm assets <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor),</b> invest in education, and increase total expenditures (<b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> <b>and</b> <b>poor).</b> Women who participated in the program had more freedom to go places and were less afraid to disagree with their husbands; the women participated more in village meetings and their children were slightly more likely to attend school. Consistent with the emphasis of the program on <b>the</b> <b>poor,</b> <b>the</b> impacts were stronger across <b>the</b> board <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> <b>and</b> <b>poor</b> participants <b>and</b> were more pronounced for long-term Scheduled Tribe participants. No significant differences are found between participants and nonparticipants in some maternal and child health indicators. Second, program participants were significantly more likely to benefit from various targeted government programs, most important the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, but also midday meals in schools, hostels, and housing programs. This was an important way in which the program contributed to the improved wellbeing of program participants. The effects captured by the analysis accrue to program participants over and above those that may accrue to all households in program villages...|$|R
