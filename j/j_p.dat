40|$|The {{effects of}} prejunctional β-adrenoceptor {{activation}} on electrically evoked noradrenaline (NA) and adenosine 5 ′-triphosphate (ATP) were studied {{by use of}} continuous amperometry and conventional intracellular recording techniques. Excitatory junction potentials (e. <b>j.</b> <b>ps)</b> were used {{as a measure of}} ATP release, and NA-induced slow depolarizations and oxidation currents as measures of NA release, from postganglionic sympathetic nerves innervating the rat tail artery in vitro. Isoprenaline (0. 1 [*]μM) increased the amplitude of e. <b>j.</b> <b>ps,</b> slow depolarizations and oxidation currents evoked by short trains of stimuli at 1 to 4 [*]Hz. The facilitatory effect of isoprenaline on e. <b>j.</b> <b>ps</b> and oxidation currents was most pronounced on responses evoked by the first stimulus in a train. Isoprenaline (0. 1 [*]μM) did not detectably alter the amplitude-frequency distribution of spontaneous e. <b>j.</b> <b>ps.</b> The facilitatory effect of isoprenaline on e. <b>j.</b> <b>ps,</b> slow depolarizations and oxidation currents was abolished by the β-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol (0. 1 [*]μM). Propranolol alone had no effect on e. <b>j.</b> <b>ps,</b> slow depolarizations or oxidation currents. Thus, activation of prejunctional β-adrenoceptors increases the release of both NA and ATP from postganglionic sympathetic nerves. The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that NA and ATP are released from the same population of nerve terminals and presumably from the same vesicles...|$|R

40|$|Non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) {{inhibitory}} transmission {{in chicken}} gizzard was studied {{by use of}} intracellular microelectrode techniques. Changes in membrane potential in response to NANC nerve stimulation were recorded in the gizzard smooth muscle pretreated with atropine (1 [*]μM) and guanethidine (1 [*]μM). Field stimulation of the intramural nerves (FS) evoked inhibitory junction potentials (i. <b>j.</b> <b>ps)</b> which were abolished by tetrodotoxin (1 [*]μM), but not inhibited at all by K+ channel blockers including apamin (0. 5 [*]μM), tetraethylammonium (TEA, 10 [*]mM), charybdotoxin (0. 2 [*]μM) and glibenclamide (10 [*]μM). NG-nitro-L-arginine (300 [*]μM), an inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) synthase, inhibited i. <b>j.</b> <b>ps.</b> The effect was reversed by L-arginine (3 [*]mM), but not by D-arginine (3 [*]mM). 8 -Bromo cyclic GMP (100 [*]μM), a membrane permeable analogue of cyclic GMP, produced a membrane hyperpolarization which was blocked by TEA (10 [*]mM) or glibenclamide (10 [*]μM). NO at concentrations of up to 400 [*]μM affected neither i. <b>j.</b> <b>ps</b> nor resting membrane potential. On the other hand, NO (80 [*]μM) caused the membrane to hyperpolarize in the smooth muscle of guinea-pig ileum.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the contribution of}} nitric oxide (NO) to inhibitory neuromuscular transmission in murine proximal colon {{and the possibility that}} citrulline is recycled to arginine to maintain the supply of substrate for NO synthesis. Intracellular microelectrode recordings were made from circular smooth muscle cells in the presence of nifedipine and atropine (both 1 [*]μM). Electrical field stimulation (EFS, 0. 3 – 20 [*]Hz) produced inhibitory junction potentials (i. <b>j.</b> <b>ps)</b> composed of an initial transient hyperpolarization (fast component) followed by a slow recovery to resting potential (slow component). L-Nitro-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME, 100 [*]μM) selectively abolished the slow component of i. <b>j.</b> <b>ps.</b> The effects of L-NAME were reversed by L-arginine (0. 2 – 2 [*]mM) but not by D-arginine (2 [*]mM). Sodium nitroprusside (an NO donor, 1 [*]μM) reversibly hyperpolarized muscle cells. This suggests that NO mediates the slow component of i. <b>j.</b> <b>ps.</b> L-Citrulline (0. 2 [*]mM) also reversed the effects of L-NAME, and this action was maintained during sustained exposures to L-citrulline (0. 2 [*]mM). This may reflect intraneuronal recycling of L-citrulline to L-arginine. Higher concentrations of L-citrulline (e. g. 2 [*]mM) had time-dependent effects. Brief exposure (15 [*]min) reversed the effects of L-NAME, but during longer exposures (30 [*]min) the effects of L-NAME gradually returned. In the continued presence of L-citrulline, L-arginine (2 [*]mM) readily restored nitrergic transmission, suggesting that during long exposures to high concentrations of L-citrulline, the ability to generate arginine from citrulline was reduced. Aspartate (2 [*]mM) had no effect on i. <b>j.</b> <b>ps,</b> the effects of L-NAME, or the actions of L-citrulline in the presence of L-NAME. L-Citrulline (0. 2 – 2 [*]mM) alone had no effect on i. <b>j.</b> <b>ps</b> under control conditions. S-methyl-L-thiocitrulline (10 [*]μM), a novel NOS inhibitor, blocked the slow component of i. <b>j.</b> <b>ps.</b> The effects of this inhibitor were reversed by L-arginine (2 [*]mM), but not by L-citrulline (2 [*]mM). These results suggest that i. <b>j.</b> <b>ps</b> in the murine colon result from release of multiple inhibitory neurotransmitters. NO mediates a slow component of enteric inhibitory neurotransmission. Recycling of L-citrulline to L-arginine may sustain substrate concentrations in support of NO synthesis and this pathway may be inhibited when concentrations of L-citrulline are elevated...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} Ca 2 + {{concentration}} and Ca 2 + channel blockers on noradrenaline (NA) and adenosine 5 ′-triphosphate (ATP) release from postganglionic sympathetic nerves {{have been investigated}} in rat tail arteries in vitro. Intracellularly recorded excitatory junction potentials (e. <b>j.</b> <b>ps)</b> were used {{as a measure of}} ATP release and continuous amperometry was used to measure NA release. Varying the extracellular Ca 2 + concentration similarly affected the amplitudes of e. <b>j.</b> <b>ps</b> and NA-induced oxidation currents evoked by trains of ten stimuli at 1 [*]Hz. The N-type Ca 2 + blocker, ω-conotoxin GVIA (ω-CTX GVIA, 0. 1 [*]μM) reduced the amplitudes of both e. <b>j.</b> <b>ps</b> (evoked by trains of ten stimuli at 1 [*]Hz) and NA-induced oxidation currents (evoked by trains of ten stimuli at 1 [*]Hz and 50 stimuli at 10 [*]Hz) by about 90 %.

Nifedipine (10 [*]μM) had no inhibitory effect on ω-CTX GVIA resistant e. <b>j.</b> <b>ps</b> and NA-induced oxidation currents. Thus both varying Ca 2 + concentration and applying Ca 2 + channel blockers results in similar effects on NA and ATP release from postganglionic sympathetic nerves.

40|$|Effects of TI- 233 (4 -isopropyl- 1 -[N 2 -(5, 6 -dimethyl-aminonaphthalene- 1 -sulphonyl) -L-arginyl]- piperidine) on glutamate-induced {{responses}} and nerve-evoked synaptic responses were compared at the crayfish neuromuscular junction. Intracellularly recorded excitatory junctional potentials (e. <b>j.</b> <b>ps)</b> were markedly augmented by TI- 233 {{when they were}} evoked at long intervals, whereas the unit size of extracellular e. <b>j.</b> <b>ps</b> was hardly affected by TI- 233 and, at that stage, the glutamate-induced current was markedly reduced by TI- 233. The decay rate of extracellular e. <b>j.</b> <b>ps</b> was slightly increased 3 min after the addition of TI- 233 at concentrations higher than 0. 05 mM. Repetitive stimulation of the excitatory axon at a high frequency caused a gradual decrease in the amplitudes of extracellular e. <b>j.</b> <b>ps</b> {{in the presence of}} TI- 233. After prolonged application of TI- 233 with repetitive nerve stimulation, the glutamate-induced response became significantly smaller than the control. TI- 233 increased the input resistance of the crayfish muscle fibre and facilitated transmitter release at the excitatory neuromuscular junction. These two effects would entirely explain the augmentation of intracellular e. <b>j.</b> <b>ps</b> by TI- 233. TI- 233 (greater than 3 microM) reduced the amplitude of current responses to trains of glutamate pulses in a dose-dependent manner, but this reduction by TI- 233 was time- and activity-dependent. The effect of TI- 233 on glutamate-induced responses was voltage-dependent and hyperpolarization increased this effect. Pretreatment of the muscle fibre with concanavalin A did not affect the gradual decline, caused by TI- 233, of the successive currents evoked by a train of glutamate pulses. The apparent differences between the glutamate-induced current and nerve-evoked synaptic response revealed by TI- 233 can be explained by open-channel block of the glutamate-activated ion-channel, and do not confute the hypothesis that glutamate is the natural transmitter substance at this junction...|$|R
