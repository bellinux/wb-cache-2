40|$|The {{decision}} to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> {{is a dangerous}} one for the student. The purpose of this quantitative {{study was to examine}} the relationship between student mathematics achievement as measured by the New York State Education Department (NYSED) Grade 4 Mathematics Test (G 4 MT), Grade 8 Mathematics Test (G 8 MT), and Integrated Algebra Mathematics Test (IAMT) and <b>dropping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>high</b> school in a medium-size school district in the Lower Hudson Region of New York. Furthermore, the study examined to what extent the New York State mathematics tests served as predictors <b>of</b> students <b>dropping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>high</b> school. The 680 research participants were students who first entered Grade 9 in the 2006 - 2007 school year. There was no statistically significant relationship between students’ mathematics achievement and <b>dropping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>high</b> school. However, there was a statistically significant relationship between student taking the NYSED G 4 MT, G 8 MT, and IAMT and <b>dropping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>high</b> school. Taking the NYSED G 8 MT and IAMT contributed significantly to the prediction <b>of</b> students <b>dropping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>high</b> school. Students taking the NYSED G 4 MT and G 8 MT were almost 3 times more likely not to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>high</b> school. Moreover, students taking the NYSED G 4 MT, G 8 MT, and IAMT were 10 times more likely not to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>high</b> school. Knowing these early warning signals could help inform district planning for interventions to address some of the reasons behind a dropout outcome...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this study, the {{researchers}} {{concentrate on the}} gap in the educational and counseling litera-ture documenting the extent to which certain psychosocial variables may contribute to the prediction of students who are at risk <b>of</b> <b>dropping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>high</b> school. Specifically, wellness, perceived stress, mattering, and at-risk status for <b>dropping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>high</b> school were assessed across 175 students attending a medium-sized high school located in the southeastern part of the United States. Participants completed a demo-graphic questionnaire, the Five Factor Wellness Inventory-Teenage Version, the Student At-Risk Identifica-tion Scale-Student Questionnaire, the General Mattering Scale, and the Perceived Stress Scale. Using a regression analysis, {{the researchers}} found that the complete model, including all seven predictor variables, significantly predicted at-risk status for <b>dropping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>high</b> school, F(7, 167) = 12. 89, p <. 05. This model accounted for 35. 1 % of the variance in at-risk status for <b>dropping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>high</b> school. Based on these findings, counselors should utilize skills and interventions that help students stay intellectually, spiritually, and emotionally engaged in the learning process...|$|R

5|$|Before Korn was formed, {{three of}} the {{original}} members of the band {{were associated with the}} band L.A.P.D. – James Shaffer, Reginald Arvizu, and David Silveria. Originally consisting of Richard Morrill, James Shaffer, and Reginald Arvizu, David Silveria joined when he was 16. When the band moved from Bakersfield, California to Los Angeles, Silveria <b>dropped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>school</b> and Shaffer stayed in Bakersfield. When Shaffer reunited with the band, they found a manager and released an EP entitled Love and Peace Dude in 1989 through Triple X Records. L.A.P.D. released their first full-length studio album on May 3, 1991 which consisted of eleven tracks. The album was entitled Who's Laughing Now. After releasing two albums, L.A.P.D. broke up. They were also briefly known as Creep, recording a demo with a singer named Corey until Shaffer, Arvizu, and Silveria enlisted Brian Welch and Jonathan Davis to form the band that went on to become Korn.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} he reached his teens, Gygax had a {{voracious}} appetite for pulp fiction authors such as Robert Howard, Jack Vance, Fritz Leiber, H. P. Lovecraft, and Edgar Burroughs. Gygax was a mediocre student, and in 1956, a few months after his father died, he <b>dropped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>school</b> in his junior year. He briefly joined the Marines, but after being diagnosed with walking pneumonia, he was given a medical discharge and moved back home with his mother. From there, he commuted to a job as shipping clerk with Kemper Insurance Co. in Chicago. Shortly after his return, a friend introduced him to Avalon Hill's new wargame Gettysburg, and Gygax was soon obsessed with the game, often playing marathon sessions once a week or more. It was also from Avalon Hill that he ordered the first blank hexagon mapping sheets that were available, which he then employed to design his own games.|$|E

40|$|People who <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>high</b> school fare {{worse in}} {{many aspects of}} life. We analyze the {{relationship}} between <b>dropping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>high</b> school and the probability of contracting a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Previous studies {{on the relationship between}} dropout status and sexual outcomes have not empirically addressed unobserved heterogeneity at the individual level. Using fixed effects estimators, we find evidence supporting a positive relationship between <b>dropping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>high</b> school and the risk of contracting an STI for females. Furthermore, we present evidence that illustrates differences between the romantic partners of dropouts versus enrolled students. These differences suggest that female dropouts may be more susceptible to contracting STIs because they partner with significantly different types of people than non-dropouts. Our results point to a previously undocumented benefit of encouraging those at risk <b>of</b> <b>dropping</b> <b>out</b> to stay in school longer...|$|R
