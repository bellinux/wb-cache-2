40|$|ABSTRACT A new {{fixation}} {{method has}} been developed for immunofluorescent microscopy using the photosensitive compound 1, 3, 5 -triazido- 2, 4, 6 -trinitrobenzene (TTB). Our results show that TTB-fixed cells are well preserved morphologically and that the cellular antigens are better preserved than conventionally <b>fixed</b> <b>cells.</b> By altering one condition {{at a time in}} the TTB fixation procedure and analyzing resulting fluorescent antitubulin staining patterns in mammalian tissue culture cells, an optimal procedure was developed. <b>Cells</b> <b>fixed</b> with TTB and stained with antitubulin, antiprekeratin, anti-intermediate filament, anti-~-actinin, antimyosin, antiactin, or anticlathrin were compared with <b>cells</b> <b>fixed</b> by conventional methods and stained with the same antibody. The quality of immunofluorescence images of TTB <b>fixed</b> <b>cells</b> was the same as or better than that of conventionally <b>fixed</b> <b>cells.</b> The most dramatic improvement in image quality was seen when using antiprekeratin or antitubulin. In dividing cells, particularly in metaphase, fluorescent staining with antiactin and anti-a-actinin was relatively excluded from the spindle. Antimyosin, on the other hand, stained the spindle and surrounding area more heavily than the subcortical region. We suggest that after TTB fixation, the immunofluorescent patterns of these contractile proteins more closely reflect their relativ...|$|R

The readings of nano drop and agarose gel electrophoresis indicate good quality DNA isolated with a rapid and simple protocol routinely using in our laboratory.

40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} of single cells are of increasing interest both from a fundamental cell biological perspective {{and in the}} context of disease diagnostics. In this respect, atomic force microscopy (AFM) has become a powerful tool for imaging and assessing mechanical {{properties of}} biological samples. However, while these tests are typically carried out on chemically <b>fixed</b> <b>cells,</b> the most important data is that on living cells. The present study applies AFM technique to assess the Young’s modulus of two cells lines: mouse embryonic fibroblasts (NIH/ 3 T 3) and human epithelial cancer cells (SW- 13).

40|$|Fluorescence {{lifetime}} imaging microscopy {{can be used}} {{to study}} protein-protein interactions by Forster Resonance Energy Transfer or to perform lifetime-based multiplexing. Fixation of samples with cells producing fluorescent fusion proteins is commonly used for preservation of samples and for staining with membrane impermeable reagents such as antibodies. However, the effect of fixation methods and mounting media on fluorescence lifetime is poorly documented so far. Here, we demonstrate that fixation by formaldehyde or methanol itself does not affect the lifetime of fluorescent proteins produced in cells but that several widely used mounting media decrease the fluorescence lifetime by up to 20 %. It is shown that <b>fixed</b> <b>cells</b> producing Aequorea victoria derived fluorescent proteins mounted in Tris buffer have fluorescence lifetimes indistinguishable from values measured in living cells. Tris buffer also allows accurate Forster Resonance Energy Transfer quantification in <b>fixed</b> <b>cells,</b> as shown with an mTurquoise 2 -SYFP 2 fusion protein. Moreover, identical lifetime contrasts are measured in living and <b>fixed</b> <b>cells</b> mounted in Tris buffer after introducing a single plasmid expressing two lifetime variants of cyan fluorescent proteins, each targeted to different locations in the cell.

30|$|Among various {{fixation}} {{agents for}} cross-linking cell membrane and cytoplasmic protein, paraformaldehyde (PFA) {{is one of}} the most widely used chemical agents for cell and tissue samples [4 – 6]. PFA causes covalent cross-links between molecules, effectively gluing them together into an insoluble meshwork that alters the mechanical properties of the cell surface. Previous studies report that the cell surface hardens after fixative treatment [7 – 10]. Compared to an unfixed cell, the mechanical properties of a <b>fixed</b> <b>cell</b> are more uniform across the entire cell surface [11]. However, there is no systematic assessment of correlation between changes in mechanical properties of live and <b>fixed</b> <b>cells.</b> Indeed, little is known about how the mechanical properties of cells depend on the PFA concentration. Furthermore, it has been revealed that subtle adjustment in fixation conditions with, e.g., PFA condition, can have dramatic effects on the immobilization of molecules within cellular membranes [12].

In dividing cells, particularly in metaphase, fluorescent staining with antiactin and anti-alpha-actinin was relatively excluded from the spindle. Antimyosin, on the other hand, stained the spindle and surrounding area more heavily than the subcortical region. We suggest that after TTB fixation, the immunofluorescent patterns of these contractile proteins more closely reflect their relative concentrations in living cells. The exact mechanism for fixation by TTB is not yet known. However, our studies indicated that TTB fixation was not caused by the typical fast photoinduced nitrene diradical mechanism, but rather by some slower, temperature-dependent reaction of a photoactivation product of TTB with the cell...|$|R

If fibrocytes are stimulated by damage to the surrounding tissue, the fibrocyte is altered into a fibroblast. The fibroblasts contain organelles that are necessary for the synthesis and excretion of proteins needed to repair the tissue damage. Fibrocytes usually do not leave the connective tissue. Reticular cells are usually larger than fibrocytes. Reticular cells are the fibrocytes of reticular connective tissue and form a network of reticular fibers. Adipocytes are fat <b>cells</b> that are <b>fixed</b> <b>cells</b> in loose connective tissue. Their main function is the storage of lipid. Macrophages arise from monocytes. Monocytes originate in the bone marrow upon which they are released into the blood stream. They are mobile and leave the blood stream to enter connective tissues where they differentiate into marcophages.The fibroblasts are the most important in the connective tissue. Fibroblasts manufacture and maintain the extracellular material. They migrate throughout the extracellular matrix to wherever they are needed. Adipocytes are cells that are very efficient at storing energy in the form of triglycerides.|$|R

We used double label immunofluorescence to compare the staining patterns of these antibodies with the total microtubule complex in the same cells that were stained with a polyclonal rabbit antitubulin reagent. Two of the monoclonal antitubulin antibodies bound to all of the cytoplasmic microtubules but Ab 1 - 6. 1 bound only a subset of cytoplasmic microtubules within individual <b>fixed</b> <b>cells.</b> Differential staining patterns were observed under various fixation conditions and staining protocols, in detergent-extracted cytoskeletons as well as in whole <b>fixed</b> <b>cells.</b> At least one physiologically defined subset of cytoplasmic microtubules, those remaining in cells pretreated for 1 h with 5 AM colcemid, appeared to consist entirely of Ab 1 - 6. 1 positive microtubules.

These results are supported by immunoblots on cells permeabilized with detergent. All the endogenous gelsolin is extracted, and the half-time for the extraction is approximately 5 s, which is about the rate predicted for diffusion. Therefore, gelsolin is not tightly bound to actin filaments in cells. The most likely interpretation of the difference between living and <b>fixed</b> <b>cells</b> is that fixation traps a fraction of gelsolin that is associated with actin filaments in short-lived complexes...|$|R
