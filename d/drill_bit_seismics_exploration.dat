40|$|Cross {{sections}} {{across the}} San Andreas Fault (SAF) have gradually evolved from depicting the fault {{as a simple}} vertical strike-slip fault into an elaborate network of faults. We present new data bearing on this issue from the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD) project. We have integrated borehole geology and geophysics with earlier surface mapping to reveal an imbricate fault zone with complex lithologic and structural interactions. Our data in-clude vertical seismic profiles (VSP) from the <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> <b>seismic</b> (DBS) method and sample analy-ses along the SAFOD borehole. The DBS method yields a seismic profile which complements surface seismic data as the <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> penetrated the rock. The SAFOD Pilot Hole (PH) array of seismometers was used to record waves from steeply dipping reflectors {{in and around the}} fault zone. The DBS images resolve the subvertical structure below 2 km depth – previously hidden in surface seismic data. These data can be combined with P-wave velocity tomography and fault-guided wave data to reveal features not seen on surface data, but that are important elements of the fault zone structure. We find that the fault consists of an 83 ° SW-dipping active plane to a depth of 5 km. At thi...|$|R
40|$|The MOONBIT {{experiment}} {{investigated the}} capability to obtain structural and stratigraphic information of planetary subsoil using Seismic While Drilling (SWD) - a geophysical technique used for Earth subsoil exploration. The basic concept of SWD uses the <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> as a <b>seismic</b> in-depth source of seismic waves, recorded by geophones as surface receivers gathering digital seismograms at different depths: signal processing provides seismic images known as Reverse Vertical Seismic Profiling (RVSP). MOONBIT’s target medium is the regolith layer on the Moon surface, covering basaltic bedrock. As innovatively RVSP SWD method, a passive Downhole Hammering Mechanism (DHM) actuates the <b>drill</b> <b>bit,</b> which becomes the borehole source of seismic waves. Two main tests were conducted in regolith simulant with buried geophones: the first test characterized the propagation velocity of seismic waves; the second test used a 1. 5 m drill over a container. Drill control strategies and robustness towards signal transmission problems of future unmanned Moon drills of missions, Earth remote controlled, were also assessed and simulated with an error generator and a remote supervisor prototype. Test results with consistent seismic signals of good quality and resolution and comparative analysis showed that the DHM <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> is an adequate source of SWD signals for RVSP planetary purposes and may support steering, drilling planning and scientific investigations...|$|R
40|$|Geophysical {{exploration}} {{is indispensable}} for planning deep drilling. Usually 2 D- or 3 D-seismics investigations are applied and, {{depending on the}} resulting geologic model for the underground, the drill site and drilling path are determined. In recent years the focus of exploration has shifted towards small-scale geological structures such as local layers and faults. Depending on the source frequencies and the target depth, 2 D- or 3 D-seismics from surface cannot always resolve such structures in particular at larger depths. In general, signal frequencies of about 30 – 70 Hz are typical for surface seismic methods. The deeper and smaller the sought-after structures are, the worse will be the resolution. Therefore, borehole seismic measurements like Vertical Seismic Profile (VSP) or Seismic While Drilling (SWD) have been developed (Fig. 1). For the VSP method geophones are normally integrated in the borehole, while the seismicsource generates seismic waves at the surface. The SWD method uses the <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> as the <b>seismic</b> source. Hence, {{the quality of the}} seismic signals is highly dependent on the drilled rock and the type of <b>drill</b> <b>bit,</b> but even well-suited rock conditions and adequate drilling may not provide sufficient data quality...|$|R
40|$|A {{breakthrough}} {{has been}} discovered for controlling seismic sources to generate selectable low frequencies. Conventional seismic sources, including sparkers, rotary mechanical, hydraulic, air guns, and explosives, {{by their very nature}} produce high-frequencies. This is counter to the need for long signal transmission through rock. The patent pending SeismicPULSER{trademark} methodology has been developed for controlling otherwise high-frequency seismic sources to generate selectable low-frequency peak spectra applicable to many seismic applications. Specifically, we have demonstrated the application of a low-frequency sparker source which can be incorporated into a <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> for <b>Drill</b> <b>Bit</b> <b>Seismic</b> While <b>Drilling</b> (SWD). To create the methodology of a controllable low-frequency sparker seismic source, it was necessary to learn how to maximize sparker efficiencies to couple to, and transmit through, rock with the study of sparker designs and mechanisms for (a) coupling the sparker-generated gas bubble expansion and contraction to the rock, (b) the effects of fluid properties and dynamics, (c) linear and non-linear acoustics, and (d) imparted force directionality. After extensive seismic modeling, the design of high-efficiency sparkers, laboratory high frequency sparker testing, and field tests were performed at the University of Texas Devine seismic test site. The conclusion of the field test was that extremely high power levels would be required to have the range required for deep, 15, 000 + ft, high-temperature, high-pressure (HTHP) wells. Thereafter, more modeling and laboratory testing led to the discovery of a method to control a sparker that could generate low frequencies required for deep wells. The low frequency sparker was successfully tested at the Department of Energy Rocky Mountain Oilfield Test Center (DOE RMOTC) field test site in Casper, Wyoming. An 8 -in diameter by 26 -ft long SeismicPULSER{trademark} drill string tool was designed and manufactured by TII. An APS Turbine Alternator powered the SeismicPULSER{trademark} to produce two Hz frequency peak signals repeated every 20 seconds. Since the ION Geophysical, Inc. (ION) seismic survey surface recording system was designed to detect a minimum downhole signal of three Hz, successful performance was confirmed with a 5. 3 Hz recording with the pumps running. The two Hz signal generated by the sparker was modulated with the 3. 3 Hz signal produced by the mud pumps to create an intense 5. 3 Hz peak frequency signal. The low frequency sparker source is ultimately capable of generating selectable peak frequencies of 1 to 40 Hz with high-frequency spectra content to 10 kHz. The lower frequencies and, perhaps, low-frequency sweeps, are needed to achieve sufficient range and resolution for realtime imaging in deep (15, 000 ft+), high-temperature (150 C) wells for (a) geosteering, (b) accurate seismic hole depth, (c) accurate pore pressure determinations ahead of the bit, (d) near wellbore diagnostics with a downhole receiver and wired drill pipe, and (e) reservoir model verification. Furthermore, the pressure of the sparker bubble will disintegrate rock resulting in an increased overall rates of penetration. Other applications for the SeismicPULSER{trademark} technology are to deploy a low-frequency source for greater range on a wireline for Reverse Vertical Seismic Profiling (RVSP) and Cross-Well Tomography. Commercialization of the technology is being undertaken by first contacting stakeholders to define the value proposition for rig site services utilizing SeismicPULSER{trademark} technologies. Stakeholders include national oil companies, independent oil companies, independents, service companies, and commercial investors. Service companies will introduce a new <b>Drill</b> <b>Bit</b> SWD service for deep HTHP wells. Collaboration will be encouraged between stakeholders in the form of joint industry projects to develop prototype tools and initial field trials. No barriers have been identified for developing, utilizing, and exploiting the low-frequency SeismicPULSER{trademark} source in a variety of applications. Risks will be minimized since <b>Drill</b> <b>Bit</b> SWD will not interfere with the drilling operation, and can be performed in a relatively quiet environment when the pumps are turned off. The new source must be integrated with other Measurement While Drilling (MWD) tools. To date, each of the oil companies and service companies contacted have shown interest in participating in the commercialization of the low-frequency SeismicPULSER{trademark} source.

Materials and Methods: In this study two models of mandible and maxilla was created and teeth 2, 5 and 8 from maxilla and teeth 25, 28 and 31 from mandible were removed. The drilling operation was performed under different conditions on jawbone models using finite element analysis and the maximum temperatures were measured in adjacent of holes. Results: <b>Drill</b> <b>bit</b> head angle of 70 degrees was created the lowest maximum temperature during drilling operation. The lowest maximum temperatures were observed in the <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> rotational speed, <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> feed rate and the force exerted on the <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> equal to 200 rpm, 120 mm/min and 60 N, respectively.
