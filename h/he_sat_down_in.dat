5|$|Although Phra Candasaro {{had studied}} with many masters, and had {{mastered}} many important Pali texts, {{he was not}} satisfied. He withdrew himself in the more peaceful area of his hometown twice. Some sources state he also withdrew himself in the jungles to meditate more, but Newell doubts this. In the eleventh rains retreat (vassa) after his ordination, in 1916, he stayed at Wat Botbon at Bangkuvieng, Nonthaburi Province. Wat Botbon was the temple {{where he used to}} receive education as a child, a temple known for its peacefulness. As seen from Luang Pu Sodh's autobiographical notes, he reflected to himself that he had been practicing meditation for many years and had still not understood the essential knowledge which the Buddha had taught. Thus, on the full-moon day in the tenth lunar month of 1916, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the main shrine hall of Wat Botbon, resolving not to waver in his practice of sitting meditation, whatever might disturb his single-mindedness. That same night he experienced in meditation {{what became known as the}} attainment of the Dhammakaya, which marked the start of Dhammakaya meditation as a tradition.|$|E
5|$|Indonesian {{artillery}} fire continued to rain {{down on the}} camp, wounding several men and sending the defenders into disarray. Sergeant-Major Williams rushed to the headquarters to order the artillery officer to bombard the taken positions before attempting to organise a counterattack himself. Whilst under heavy Indonesian fire, Williams gathered a section of defenders who had taken refuge in a slit trench and led them towards the captured outer positions. A shell landed among the group and wounded half of them, but Williams and the remainder engaged at least thirty Indonesian infantry who had been firing into the base from the trench in vicious hand-to-hand combat and managed to push them from it with minor casualties. Williams them looked to secure the perimeter, but seeing that the Indonesians were massing for a second attack, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> a vacated machine gun nest and sprayed {{the new wave of}} attackers, who attempted to seize the command bunker, with fire. This was not without cost, and Williams was fortunate to have escaped with a single head wound, which nevertheless blinded him in one eye, though he did not notice this in the heat of battle. Williams then began to receive supporting rifle fire from other British troops in nearby trenches, as well bombardment from the single remaining mortar and some 105mm artillery emplacements from a nearby camp.|$|E
25|$|In the Bhagavata Purana, it is {{described}} that after Balarama {{took part in}} the battle causing the destruction of the remainder of the Yadu dynasty and witnessing the disappearance of Krishna, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> a meditative state and departed from this world.|$|E

25|$|Moscati {{died in the}} {{afternoon}} of 12 April 1927. He had attended Mass that morning, receiving Communion as he always did, and spent {{the remainder of the}} morning at the hospital. Upon returning home he busied himself with patients until around three, after which, feeling tired, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> an armchair in his office; soon after this, he died.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{transaction}} was completed, Fiala began acting like he already owned the club. He started remodeling it and hired his own bouncers. The final provocation was when Fiala moved into Gravano's private office and began breaking through an office wall. Gravano, enraged, stormed {{into the office}} followed by Garafola. Fiala was standing behind Gravano's desk. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> Gravano's chair, smirking at the two men.|$|E
500|$|When he said Jesus again I couldn't take it, and for {{the only}} time in my life I was discourteous, which I regret to this day. I said, [...] "Mr. Mauriac," [...] we called him Maître, [...] "ten years or so ago, I have seen children, {{hundreds}} of Jewish children, who suffered more than Jesus did on his cross and we do not speak about it." [...] I felt all of a sudden so embarrassed. I closed my notebook and went to the elevator. He ran after me. He pulled me back; <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> his chair, and I in mine, and he began weeping.... And then, at the end, without saying anything, he simply said, [...] "You know, maybe you should talk about it." ...|$|E
60|$|He did not {{immediately}} answer her. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> again <b>in</b> the chair by her side, {{and pointed to the}} letter.|$|R

500|$|Zeng Liansong, {{a citizen}} from Wenzhou, Zhejiang, {{was working in}} Shanghai {{at the time the}} {{announcement}} came out; he wanted to create a flag design to express his patriotic enthusiasm for the new country. In the middle of July, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> his attic for multiple nights to come up with designs. His inspiration for the current design comes from the stars shining in the night sky. He thought of a Chinese proverb [...] "longing for the stars, longing for the moon", ( [...] , pàn xīngxīng pàn yuèliàng) which shows yearning. He viewed the CPC as the great saviour ( [...] , dà jiùxīng [...] "great saving star") of the Chinese people, being represented by a larger star. The idea for four small stars came from On the People's Democratic Dictatorship a speech by Mao Zedong, which defined the Chinese people as consisting of four social classes, also referred to in Asian cultures as the four occupations (...) shi, nong, gong, shang ("the working class, the peasantry, the urban petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie"). [...] Yellow also implies that China belongs to the Chinese people, a [...] "yellow race". After working out the details of the placement of the stars and their sizes (he had tried to put all of the stars in the center, but believed it would be too heavy and dull), he sent his [...] "Five Stars on a Field of Red" [...] ( [...] , hóng dì wǔxīng qí) design to the committee in the middle of August.|$|E
2500|$|Sassoon's {{periods of}} duty on the Western Front {{were marked by}} {{exceptionally}} brave actions, including the single-handed capture of a German trench in the Hindenburg Line. Armed with grenades, he scattered sixty German soldiers:He went over with bombs in daylight, under covering fire {{from a couple of}} rifles, and scared away the occupants. A pointless feat, since instead of signalling for reinforcements, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the German trench and began reading a book of poems which he had brought with him. When he went back he did not even report. Colonel Stockwell, then in command, raged at him. The attack on Mametz Wood had been delayed for two hours because British patrols were still reported to be out. [...] "British patrols" [...] were Siegfried and his book of poems. [...] "I'd have got you a D.S.O., if you'd only shown more sense," [...] stormed Stockwell.Sassoon's bravery was inspiring to the extent that soldiers of his company said that they felt confident only when they were accompanied by him. He often went out on night-raids and bombing patrols and demonstrated ruthless efficiency as a company commander. Deepening depression at the horror and misery the soldiers were forced to endure produced in Sassoon a paradoxically manic courage, and he was nicknamed [...] "Mad Jack" [...] by his men for his near-suicidal exploits. On 27 July 1916 he was awarded the Military Cross; the citation read: ...|$|E
2500|$|On August 12, 2006 Timothy James Truett of Montgomery Village {{allegedly}} made a [...] "call to Ali's {{office in}} which he asked if Ali was a Muslim and made derogatory remarks about Islam to Ali's campaign manager." [...] Afterward, Truett drove to [...] "the cul-de-sac outside Ali's Gaithersburg home, which doubles as his campaign office." [...] There, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> a lawn chair near the home [...] "with a hand-lettered sign bearing a crude denunciation of Islam" [...] Truett [...] "wore a T-shirt reading 'This mind is an Allah-free zone'." [...] Ali went out {{to look at the}} man and take pictures but did not speak to him, explaining [...] "I knew he was there to bait me." [...] Ali later recalled [...] "I felt like he was intimidating and trying to menace me and my family, similar to when people burned crosses in someone's front yard. I think it was the exact same message." [...] Ali's wife stepped outside and took pictures of Truett. [...] An older man approached Truett and offered him some water. Ali then spoke to the older man and the older man went back inside. Ali placed one of his campaign yard signs next to Truett and took a picture. [...] Truett then got up and left. Ali followed him and got pictures of his license plate. Truett then phoned Ali's office again but was hung up on. [...] Ali later posted pictures of Truett, Truett's birth date and address on his campaign web site.|$|E
