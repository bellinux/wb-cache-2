40|$|In recent times, the MATLAB {{language}} {{has emerged as}} a popular alternative for program-ming in diverse application domains such as sig-nal processing and meteorology. The {{language has}} a powerful array syntax with a large set of pre-defined operators and functions that operate on arrays or array sections, making it an ideal candidate for applications involving substantial array-based processing. Yet, for all the programming convenience that the language offers, designing a parser and scan-ner capable of mimicking the language’s syn-tax has proven to be an acutely difficult task. The language has many context-sensitive con-structions, and though numerous front-end im-plementations of MATLAB and MATLAB-like languages exist, not much has been discussed re-garding the efficient compile-time parsing of such languages or how its syntax impacts the parsing process. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a compiler front-end for the MATLAB language. We discuss in detail both the indigenously designed grammar responsible for syntax analysis as well as the lexical speci-fication that complements the grammar. In the course of our attempts to emulate MATLAB’s syntax, we were able to unravel certain key is-sues relating to its syntax, such as the complica-tions arising in parsing command-form function invocations within a compile-time environment, the context-sensitive interpretation of the sin-gle quote character, and the translation of white space within matrices into <b>element</b> <b>separators.</b> The front-end effects a conversion of the original source to an intermediate form in which state-∗This research was supported by DARPA under Contract F 30602 – 98 – 2 – 0144. ments are represented as abstract syntax trees and the flow of control between statements by a control-flow graph.

A SUS 310 S austenitic stainless steel was used as the separator material. Corrosion proceeded via three steps; a formation step of corrosion product in which rapid corrosion take places until a stable corrosion product is formed after the beginning of corrosion; secondly, a protection step against corrosion until breakaway occurs after the formation step of the stable corrosion product; finally, an advance step of corrosion after breakaway.

The working condition of the oil separator will greatly influence the normal running of many plants. The lube oil separator used in our laboratory is Mitsubishi SJ 700. In the processing of purifying, oil leakage from the water outlet is found. In order to find failure point, the basic structure and the working principle of the separator is introduced. The separator is dismantled according to the procedure. After cleaning some parts found dirty and replacing some sealing <b>elements,</b> the <b>separator</b> is reassembled. When starting the separating process again, the failure remains. Through further analyzing the structure and working principle of the separator, the trouble spot is found out.

The ash samples of the gasifier ash, separator ash and wet scrubber ash were collected in a 1 MW circulating fluidized bed (CFB) wood gasification power generation plant. Particle size distribution of ashes was determined by gravimetric measurement and super probe analyzer. The concentrations of trace elements and major ash-forming elements, such as As, Al, Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, K, Mg, Na, Ni, Ph, Ti in different ashes {{as a function of}} particle size were determined by Inductive Coupled Plasma Spectrometer. The concentrations and distribution coefficient and enrichment factors of the inorganic elements in ashes were studied. X-ray fluorescence spectrometer and X-ray powder diffraction were used to provide information on the characteristics of the ashes. The results showed that most of the trace elements had an enrichment tendency in the finer size particles. A considerable amount of the ashes was residual carbon. Most of the volatile e. g. halogen elements and alkali elements existed mainly in wet scrubber ash and enriched in fly ash. Most of the Si, Ni, Pb, Zn, Cr, Cd were found in separator ash, indicating an enrichment of heavy metal <b>elements</b> in <b>separator</b> ash. K, S, Mn, Cu mainly existed in gasifier ash.

The only data required by the simulation models are the number of separation banks, number of species, feed rates, composition of feed and the separation factors of the different species. A knowledge-base which permits the intelligent choice of bounds, is used to generate the bounds on the separation factors. The knowledge-base may be updated by the user or the simulation model itself. In this paper, a gravity concentration plant is described by two linear models, one being the subset of the other. The computer program formulates and solves these linear models sequentially by using any suitable linear programming (LP) package. The first model optimizes the flow rates and {{the path of the}} valuable <b>elements</b> between the <b>separator</b> banks. This model produces the optimal flow rates of the valuable elements between the banks, as well as the circuit configuration. The second model simulates the flow rates of all elements {{in such a way that}} the concentrate grade is maximized. An optical grade for the valuable elements in the concentrate is given by the second model. The circuit configurations, grades and recoveries produced by the simulation model are similiar to those encountered in industry. This model may also be used to suggest an alternative circuit structure and operating conditions in the case of drastic changes in the operating environment of the plant.

40|$|Extracting Natural Gas {{from the}} {{reservoirs}} and transporting it to shore requires the gas to be pure from liquids and contaminants. These contaminants can be {{extracted from the}} gas by separators. A new separation technology, the Lynx separator, has been developed at NTNU, where a rotating <b>element</b> inside the <b>separator</b> is to capture liquid particles and introduce a centrifugal force for increasing the separation efficiency. The knowledge on how this element influences the flow and performs is limited, {{and there are no}} known experiments performed on this system per today. Using CFD tools to construct a suitable model can contribute to increase the knowledge on how this capturing element impacts the flow. The work presented in this thesis has been looking into the structure of metal foams used as the separation mechanism in Lynx separator. A model of a single cell representing a microstructure of the real life foam geometry has been constructed in ANSYS Mechanical APDL and further included in ANSYS FLUENT, where three cells were united as one element with a capturing cylinder around to represent a simple small scale model of the separator. By turbulent k-omega modeling in combination with the Discrete Phase Model, simulations on gas-liquid flow represented by air with inert water particles of different diameters has been calculated upon, where the focus has been set on the interaction between the particles and the metal foam cells. Different cases have been investigated where the capturing element has been set into different angular velocities to quantify the impact on the gas flow and particle behavior. The presented model shows the influence of the different rotating velocities on both gas and particle flow. The capture of particles with a stationary metal foam is mainly limited to larger particles with a diameter of 100 &# 181;m and 500 &# 181;m. Introducing a centrifugal force results in swirling flow for both gas and larger particles, reducing the interaction of larger particles with the metal foam cells as these particles swirl out towards the walls. The flow of 10 &# 181;m particles result in a radial displacement as a result of colliding with the metal foam, separating them from the gas, while capture of 1 &# 181;m has showed to be very limited. Introducing a very high rotational velocity has shown to reduce the reliability of the proposed model, and it cannot be verified that this model is reliable as the rotational velocity exceeds 2000 rotations per minute. </p...|$|R
