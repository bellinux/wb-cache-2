Treatment of diabetes and its related diseases can be achieved by <b>inhibiting</b> <b>key</b> digestives enzymes-related to starch digestion secreted by pancreas. Methods The formulation omega- 3 with fenugreek terpenenes was administrated to surviving diabetic rats.

Results the findings revealed that administration of formulation omega- 3 with fenugreek terpenenes (Om 3 /terp) considerably <b>inhibited</b> <b>key</b> enzymes-related to diabetes such as α-amylase activity by 46 and 52 % and maltase activity by 37 and 35 % respectively in pancreas and plasma. Moreover, the findings revealed that this supplement helped protect the β-Cells of the rats from death and damage. Interestingly, the formulation Om 3 /terp modulated key enzyme related to hypertension such as ACE by 37 % in plasma and kidney. Moreover administration of fenugreek essential oil to surviving diabetic rats improved starch and glucose oral tolerance additively. Furthermore, the Om 3 /terp also decreased significantly the glucose, triglyceride (TG) and total-cholesterol (TC) and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) rates in the plasma and liver of diabetic rats and increased the HDL-Cholesterol (HDL-Ch) level, which helped maintain the homeostasis of blood lipid.

40|$|SummaryThe {{concept of}} “metabolic inflexibility” was first {{introduced}} to describe the failure of insulin-resistant human subjects to appropriately adjust mitochondrial fuel selection in response to nutritional cues. This phenomenon has since gained increasing recognition as a core component of the metabolic syndrome, but the underlying mechanisms have remained elusive. Here, we identify an essential role for the mitochondrial matrix enzyme, carnitine acetyltransferase (CrAT), in regulating substrate switching and glucose tolerance. By converting acetyl-CoA to its membrane permeant acetylcarnitine ester, CrAT regulates mitochondrial and intracellular carbon trafficking. Studies in muscle-specific Crat knockout mice, primary human skeletal myocytes, and human subjects undergoing L-carnitine supplementation support a model wherein CrAT combats nutrient stress, promotes metabolic flexibility, and enhances insulin action by permitting mitochondrial efflux of excess acetyl moieties that otherwise <b>inhibit</b> <b>key</b> regulatory enzymes such as pyruvate dehydrogenase.

Furthermore, mood-stabilising drugs have been shown to <b>inhibit</b> <b>key</b> enzymes that regulate PIns production and alter neuronal growth cone morphology in an inositol-reversible manner. Here, we describe analyses of expression and function of the recently identified H + / myo -inositol transporter (HMIT) investigated as a potential regulator of PIns signalling. Results We show that HMIT is primarily a neuronal transporter widely expressed in the rat and human brain, with particularly high levels in the hippocampus and cortex, as shown by immunohistochemistry. The transporter is localised at the Golgi apparatus in primary cultured neurones. No HMIT-mediated electrophysiological responses were detected in rat brain neurones or slices; in addition, inositol transport and homeostasis were unaffected in HMIT targeted null-mutant mice. Conclusion Together, these data do not support a role for HMIT as a neuronal plasma membrane inositol transporter, as previously proposed. However, we observed that HMIT can transport inositol triphosphate, indicating unanticipated intracellular functions for this transporter that may be relevant to mood control. </p...|$|E

HSP 27 and aB-crystallin accumulated in both soluble and, more prominently, insoluble fractions after exposure to MG- 132, a proteasome inhibitor. Enhanced expression of mRNAs for HSP 27 and aB-crystallin was observed, suggesting transcriptional activation. Phosphorylation of HSP 27 and aB-crystallin in cells treated with MG- 132 was enhanced concomitantly with activation of p 38 and p 44 / 42 MAP kinase pathways. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that exposure to proteasome inhibitors induced the formation of aggresomes in U 373 MG cells, to which HSP 27 and aB-crystallin were recruited.
