5|$|Although Casablanca was an A-list {{film with}} {{established}} stars and first-rate writers, no one involved with its production <b>expected</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be {{anything out of}} the ordinary. It was just one of hundreds of pictures produced by Hollywood every year. Casablanca was rushed into release {{to take advantage of the}} publicity from the Allied invasion of North Africa a few weeks earlier. It had its world premiere on November 26, 1942, in New York City and was released nationally in the United States on January 23, 1943. The film was a solid if unspectacular success in its initial run.|$|E
5|$|On May31, Tropical Depression One {{developed}} in the western Caribbean Sea, a day {{before the start of}} the Atlantic hurricane season. The depression moved northeastward, passing just northwest of Isla de la Juventud before striking the Cuban mainland south of Havana. As it crossed the country, its strongest rainfall was east of the center, and the depression failed to intensify beyond winds of 30mph (45km/h). The National Hurricane Center never <b>expected</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> strengthen further, due to unfavorable wind shear. After a hurricane hunters flight could not detect a circulation, The depression degenerated into an open trough east of Florida on June2.|$|E

It was widely believed during this lead-up to the review, the first Arrow MkII, RL-206, would be prepared for an attempt at both world speed and altitude records.|$|E

5|$|A year {{prior to}} Kameo release, GamesRadar wrote {{that while they}} highly {{anticipated}} the title and <b>expected</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be of high quality, they thought the game's continual delays would likely hurt the final product. Closer to release, Tom Bramwell (Eurogamer) added that he had expected the game {{to be the best}} among the Xbox 360 launch titles. Kameo core gameplay concept brought his anticipation to par with that customary for The Legend of Zelda titles, and he thought the game would reap the benefits of its long development through refined audiovisuals. Xbox executive Peter Moore announced Kameo as his favorite launch title in anticipation of the Xbox 360's launch.|$|E
5|$|By early August14, the shear had {{substantially}} {{disrupted the}} storm, leaving the low-level center of circulation exposed {{from the area}} of convection, which was also deteriorating. After meandering, the storm began to move westward. Forecasters <b>expected</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> resume a northwestward track as high pressure {{to the south of}} Bermuda was forecast to weaken and another high was predicted to form southwest of the Azores. By 1800UTC on August14, the strong shear had further weakened the storm, and it no longer met the criteria for a tropical cyclone. It degenerated into a remnant low, and the National Hurricane Center issued their final advisory on the cyclone. Moving westward, it occasionally produced bursts of convective activity, before dissipating on August18.|$|E
5|$|Design {{work on the}} Type 34-class destroyers {{began in}} 1932, around the time that Weimar Germany renounced the {{armament}} limitations of the Versailles Treaty that had ended World War I. Initial designs were for large ships {{more powerful than the}} French and Polish destroyers then in service, but the design grew as the Kriegsmarine now <b>expected</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> serve as a small cruiser. The design work appears to have been rushed and not well-thought out as the short forecastle and lack of flare at the bow compromised the ships' seakeeping ability and their stability was inadequate. The only real innovative part of the design, the high-pressure boilers, were an over-complicated design that received almost no shipboard testing before being installed in the Type 34s and frequently broke down throughout the life of the ships.|$|E

5|$|In 2015, it was {{reported}} that Broadway producer Kevin McCollum had signed a deal two years earlier with Fox to develop some of the movies from its back catalog into musicals for the stage. Two he expressed particular interest in were Mrs. Doubtfire and The Devil Wears Prada. Early in 2017, McCollum announced that in partnership with Fox Stage Productions, he was developing a musical version of The Devil Wears Prada (based on both the movie and the book). Sir Elton John will be composing the score for the project with playwright Paul Rudnick, who had written some early scenes for the screenplay, mostly with Miranda, writing the book and lyrics. McCollum did not say when he <b>expected</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> premiere but hoped it would eventually play on Broadway.|$|E
5|$|Whistler {{submitted}} {{the painting to}} the Academy, but according to Heffernan, he <b>expected</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be rejected at this point. The previous year, in 1861, another painting had caused a minor scandal. Edwin Henry Landseer's The Shrew Tamed showed a horse with a woman resting on the ground nearby. The model was named as Ann Gilbert, a noted equestrienne of the period: however it was soon rumoured that it was actually Catherine Walters, the notorious London courtesan. Whistler's painting was reminiscent enough of Landseer's that the judges were wary of admitting it. White Girl was submitted to the Academy along with three etchings, all three of which were accepted, while the painting was not.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Kursk, Model had {{anticipated}} {{the possibility of}} a Soviet attack into the Orel Salient, and had (without OKH's knowledge) constructed extensive defensive works to meet such an attack. Following the stalling of his advance, the Soviet counter-offensive, Operation Kutuzov, duly opened on 12 July. It involved not just Rokossovsky's Central Front, but also the Bryansk and Western Fronts, a greater concentration of forces than Model had assaulted in Operation Citadel. For the battle, Kluge placed him in command of Second Panzer Army in addition to Ninth Army—again, a larger total force than he had commanded in Citadel. The Soviet preponderance of strength was such that Stavka <b>expected</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> take only 48 hours to reach Orel, splitting the German forces into three parts; instead, the battle ended three weeks later with Model's orderly withdrawal from the salient. An idea of the scale of the fighting compared to Citadel can be gained from the combined casualty lists for Second Panzer and Ninth Armies: from 1 to 10 July, the Germans took 21,000 casualties, and from 11 to 31 July, 62,000. Despite these losses he had inflicted similarly heavy casualties on the three Red Army Fronts, shortened the line, and avoided annihilation. His standing with Hitler thus survived the failure of Citadel.|$|E

5|$|Warlugulong {{was first}} {{exhibited}} at {{a show in}} Alice Springs, where it attracted crowds of interested viewers, but failed to sell. Realities Gallery in Melbourne then included the work in a major exhibition of Papunya Tula artworks. It was purchased for A$1,200 by the Commonwealth Bank, which hung it in a bank training centre cafeteria on the Mornington Peninsula. The bank sold it by auction in 1996. The auction house trading the work <b>expected</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> fetch around $5,000 and {{did not make a}} feature of it in the catalogue, but dealers including Hank Ebes, the successful bidder, recognised the painting's significance and it sold for $36,000 plus commission. After hanging in Ebes's living room for eleven years, it was auctioned in Melbourne by Sotheby's on 24 July 2007. It sold for $2.4million, thoroughly eclipsing the previous record for an Indigenous Australian painting, set when Emily Kngwarreye's Earth's Creation was bought in May of the same year for just over $1million. Warlugulongs buyer was the National Gallery of Australia, which purchased the work as part of its 25th Anniversary Gifts Program. The Gallery considers the painting to be possibly the most important in its collection of Indigenous Australian art. As of 2016, the work is on display in the National Gallery.|$|E

25|$|Gott, the XIII Corps commander, {{appointed}} Major-General Klopper of the 2nd South African Division {{commander of}} the Tobruk garrison. In addition to the two South African brigades, he had the 201st Guards (Motorised) Brigade, 11th Indian Infantry Brigade, 32nd Army Tank Brigade and the 4th Anti-Aircraft Brigade. Tobruk had withstood a siege of nine months, before being relieved by Operation Crusader in December 1941. Allied leaders <b>expected</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> {{be able to hold}} out for two months with the supplies in the fortress. Auchinleck viewed the defence of Tobruk as non-essential and had already told Neil Ritchie that he did not intend to hold it at all costs.|$|E
25|$|Fitzgerald {{considered}} the novel {{to be his}} masterwork and <b>expected</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> eclipse the popularity and acclaim of his earlier novels, particularly The Great Gatsby. However, it was instead met with mixed reviews and lukewarm sales. This greatly distressed Fitzgerald and continued to puzzle him throughout his life. In its {{first three months of}} release, Tender Is the Night sold 12,000 copies compared to This Side of Paradise, which sold over 50,000 during a similar frame. While it received a handful of extremely positive reviews, the prevailing consensus was that its quintessentially 1920s style and subject matter was no longer modern or of sufficient interest to readers.|$|E

His new mother-in-law, also called Ann Thornton, had inherited a fortune of £8,000 after Colonel Brookes committed suicide in 1834. She died on 18 January 1849, two weeks after coming to stay with Palmer; she was known to have lent him money. An elderly Dr Bamford recorded a verdict of apoplexy.

25|$|On 18 December, German {{infantry}} and armor resumed their {{attack on the}} twin villages. They were supported by the German 560th Heavy Antitank Battalion equipped with the state-of-the-art Jagdpanther tank destroyer. The Jagdpanther was armed with the 88mm cannon and the German leadership <b>expected</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be the decisive element of the battle. The battle opened {{on the morning of}} the 18th with both sides targeting the village area with repeated artillery strikes, and German armored vehicles advanced into the twin villages. All that day and night, the battle raged, with SS tank and assault guns hitting the villages from the east, supported by a barrage of Nebelwerfer rockets. These forces were met in turn by a hailstorm of U.S. heavy artillery shells with proximity fuses and about 20 Sherman tanks belonging to the U.S. 741st Tank Battalion, and several M10 tank destroyers.|$|E
25|$|Pre-release {{audience}} pollings {{predicted the}} film to take in $20million its opening weekend. However, Paramount <b>expected</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be closer to $15million.

The 20th highest grossing locations on Friday were in Salt Lake City, Oklahoma City, Knoxville, Kansas City, and San Antonio. The opening was lower than other recent dance films like, Save the Last Dance (2001, $23.4million), Step Up (2006, $20.7million), but it performed around the same as Step Up 3D (2010, $15.8million) and You Got Served (2004, $16.1million). The 1984 Footloose opened to $20million when adjusted for ticket price inflation. In its second weekend the film held well, with a drop of 34percent.
