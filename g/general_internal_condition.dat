40|$|ABSTRACT Backgroud: The World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule II (WHODAS II) is a {{new measure}} of {{functioning}} and disability that is conceptually compatible with the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF). In contrast to other measures of health status, the WHODAS II {{is based on an}} international classification system, it is designed to be applicable across different cultures, and it treats all disorders at parity when determining the level of functioning. Objective: The general objective {{of this study is to}} investigate whether the WHODAS II – German version – is a useful instrument for measuring functioning and disability in patients with musculoskeletal <b>conditions,</b> cardiovascular and <b>general</b> <b>internal</b> <b>conditions,</b> stroke, breast cancer and depressive disorder. Specific objectives are to assess its psychometric properties reliability (internal consistency, Cronbach's Alpha), validity (factor analysis of dimensionality, convergent validity, discriminant validity), and sensitivity to change (effect size and standardized response mean), to determine to what extent the WHODAS II correlates with a traditional generic instrument for measuring Health Related Quality of Life, the SF- 36, and to define its sensitivity to change after a rehabilitative intervention in relation to that other instrument. Methods: Patients with musculoskeletal <b>conditions,</b> cardiovascular and <b>general</b> <b>internal</b> <b>conditions,</b> stroke, breast cancer and depressive disorder participated. The patients completed the questionnaires WHODAS II and SF- 36. After a rehabilitation treatment the same patients completed these questionnaires again in order to assess sensitivity to change. Analyses of measurement properties were conducted. Sensitivity to change was calculated by the effect size (ES) and standardized response mean (SRM). Results: Mean score on the WHODAS II is 21. 98 (SD 14. 32) for musculoskeletal conditions, 18. 47 (SD 15. 32) for <b>internal</b> <b>conditions,</b> 38. 72 (SD 24. 79) for stroke, 23. 84 (SD 16. 61) for breast cancer, and 44. 56 (SD 18. 95) for depressive disorder. High reliability is obtained. For the most part, the results of the scale replication confirm the determined six domains of the questionnaire. For the domain Activities, a clear distinction between work und household activities is apparent in both musculoskeletal and <b>internal</b> <b>conditions.</b> The correlations found in comparison to the SF- 36 indicated that the WHODAS II (German version) measured indeed the expected constructs. The effect sizes of the WHODAS II Total Score range from 0. 163 to 0. 687 depending on the subgroup; effect sizes of the SF- 36 summary scores from 0. 025 to 1. 395, respectively. In terms of patients reporting an improvement of general health status, effect sizes are accordingly higher (0. 220 to 0. 915 for the WHODAS II; 0. 083 to 2. 023 for the SF- 36). Conclusion: The WHODAS II (German version) is a useful instrument for measuring functioning and disability in patients with musculoskeletal diseases, internal diseases, stroke, breast cancer and depressive disorder. It is reliable and valid and shows similar sensitivity to change scores as the SF- 36 in the accordingly subscales...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} new semi-analytical method for solving {{multilayer}} diffusion problems with time-varying external boundary <b>conditions</b> and <b>general</b> <b>internal</b> boundary <b>conditions</b> at the interfaces between adjacent layers. The convergence rate of the semi-analytical method, relative {{to the number of}} eigenvalues, is investigated and the effect of varying the interface conditions on the solution behaviour is explored. Numerical experiments demonstrate that solutions can be computed using the new semi-analytical method that are more accurate and more efficient than the unified transform method of Sheils [Appl. Math. Model., 40 : 450 - 464, 2017]. Furthermore, unlike classical analytical solutions and the unified transform method, only the new semi-analytical method is able to correctly treat problems with both time-varying external boundary conditions and a large number of layers. The paper is concluded by replicating solutions to several important industrial, environmental and biological applications previously reported in the literature, demonstrating the wide applicability of the work.

40|$|The Society of <b>General</b> <b>Internal</b> Medicine asked a {{task force}} to redefine the domain of <b>general</b> <b>internal</b> medicine. The task force {{believes}} that the chaos and dysfunction that characterize today's medical care, and the challenges facing <b>general</b> <b>internal</b> medicine, should spur innovation. These are our recommendations: while remaining true to its core values and competencies, <b>general</b> <b>internal</b> medicine should stay both broad and deep—ranging from uncomplicated primary care to continuous care of patients with multiple, complex, chronic diseases. Postgraduate and continuing education should develop mastery. Wherever they practice, general internists should be able to lead teams and be responsible for the care their teams give, embrace changes in information systems, and aim to provide most of the care their patients require. Current financing of physician services, especially fee-for-service, must be changed to recognize the value of services performed outside the traditional face-to-face visit and give practitioners incentives to improve quality and efficiency, and provide comprehensive, ongoing care. <b>General</b> <b>internal</b> medicine residency training should be reformed to provide both broad and deep medical knowledge, as well as mastery of informatics, management, and team leadership. <b>General</b> <b>internal</b> medicine residents should have options to tailor their final 1 to 2  years to fit their practice goals, often earning a certificate of added qualification (CAQ) in special generalist fields. Research will expand to include practice and operations management, developing more effective shared decision making and transparent medical records, and promoting the close personal connection that both doctors and patients want.

In this solution approach, regardless of boundary conditions, the displacement and rotation components of the sector plate are written {{in the form of}} the trigonometric series expansion in which several auxiliary terms are added to ensure and accelerate the convergence of the series. Each of the unknown coefficients is taken as the generalized coordinate and determined using the Raleigh- Ritz method. The accuracy and reliability of the present solution are validated by the comparison with the results found in the literature, and numerous new results for composite laminated annular sector plates considering various kinds of boundary conditions are presented. Comprehensive studies on the effects of elastic restraint parameters, layout schemes and locations of line/arc supports are also made. New results are obtained for laminated annular sector plates subjected to elastic boundary restraints and arbitrary internal radial line and circumferential arc supports in both directions, and they may serve as benchmark solutions for future researches...|$|R
