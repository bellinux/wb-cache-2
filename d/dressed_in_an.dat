5|$|On 24 June 1944, a Belgian-Polish Jew, Mala Zimetbaum, {{escaped with}} her Polish boyfriend, Edek Galiński, {{dressed in a}} stolen prisoner-guard uniform. They were later recaptured, tortured, and {{executed}} by the SS. On 21 July 1944, inmate Jerzy Bielecki, <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> SS uniform and using a faked pass, managed to cross the camp's gate together with his Jewish girlfriend, Cyla. Both survived the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{first and}} most {{significant}} difference is in Napoleon, in his clothing, and in his general stature. David's version depicts Napoleon, <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> immaculate, multi-coloured uniform with a billowing cape. Delaroche's version, however, sees Napoleon in a fairly ordinary, gray coat with {{the sole purpose of}} keeping the cold away, rather than showing him as the symbol he may have represented - that of a gallant and powerful war leader, which is the impression given in David's version.|$|E
5|$|Growing up {{primarily}} at Langley Field, Virginia, Olds virtually made daily {{contact with the}} small group of officers who would lead the US Army Air Forces in World War II (one neighbor was Major Carl Spaatz, destined to become the first Chief of Staff of the USAF), and as a result was imbued with an unusually strong dedication to the air service, and conversely, with a low tolerance for officers who did not exhibit the same. On November 10, 1925, his father appeared as a witness on behalf of Billy Mitchell during Mitchell's court-martial in Washington, D.C.. He brought three-year-old Robin with him to court, <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> Air Service uniform, and posed with him for newspaper photographers before testifying.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} Corgan reading {{a comic book}} <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> ice cream man uniform. A clip of the intro to the song is played and stopped {{repeatedly}} before the song begins. Groups {{of two or more}} people are kissing each other around Corgan as he drives in an ice cream van through a desert. Corgan picks up a dress-wearing Iha and the two drive for a while before stopping at a gas station, where Chamberlin and Wretzky appear as gas attendants. After Iha changes into a yellow and white cowboy outfit, the band paints the van in a multitude of colors. More people are shown kissing in the hills as the band drives away from the gas station in the van. However, Corgan is ultimately kicked out of the van, and the video ends with Corgan walking off the road wearing a cowboy hat as the van drives away. The video was filmed on August 29, 1993.|$|E

25|$|The {{competition}} {{to win the}} part of Mammy in Gone with the Wind was almost as fierce as that for Scarlett O'Hara. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt wrote to film producer David O. Selznick to ask that her own maid, Elizabeth McDuffie, be given the part. McDaniel did not think she would be chosen because she had earned her reputation as a comic actress. One source claimed that Clark Gable recommended that the role be given to McDaniel; in any case, {{she went to her}} audition <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> authentic maid's uniform and won the part.|$|E

25|$|Cavendish was a shy man who {{was uncomfortable}} in society and avoided it when he could. He conversed little, always <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> old-fashioned suit, and {{developed}} no known deep personal attachments outside his family. Cavendish was taciturn and solitary and regarded by many as eccentric. He only communicated with his female servants by notes. By one account, Cavendish had a back staircase added to his house {{in order to avoid}} encountering his housekeeper because he was especially shy of women. The contemporary accounts of his personality have led some modern commentators, such as Oliver Sacks, to speculate that he had Asperger syndrome, though he may merely have been anthropophobic.|$|E
25|$|The {{painting}} {{has only}} two figures, the painter and his subject, a woman with downcast eyes. The painter {{was thought to be}} a self-portrait of the artist; Jean-Louis Vaudoyer suggested the young woman could be his daughter. The painter sits in front of the painting on the easel, where you can see the sketch of the crown. He is <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> elegant black garment with cuts on the sleeves and on the back that offers a glimpse of the shirt underneath. He has short puffy breeches and orange stockings, an expensive and fashionable garment that is also found in other works of the time, as in a well-known self-portrait by Rubens.|$|E
25|$|The Alien {{is portrayed}} by both Woodruff, Jr. {{in a suit}} and a rod puppet filmed against bluescreen and {{optically}} composited into the live-action footage, with the rods removed by rotoscoping. A mechanical alien head was also used for close-ups. The suit adapted the design used in Aliens so Woodruff could walk on all fours. Woodruff's head was contained in the neck of the suit, because the head was filled with animatronics to move the mouth of the Alien. Fincher suggested that a Whippet be <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> alien costume for on-set coverage of the quadrupedal alien, but the visual effects team was dissatisfied with the comical result and the idea was dropped in favor of the puppet.|$|E

25|$|Schaefer served four {{terms as}} mayor, being re-elected in 1975, 1979 and 1983, each time {{receiving}} 85% {{or more of}} the vote. He was known for his attention to detail, taking notes of strewn garbage and other violations as he rode around, and ordering them fixed immediately. A famous photograph shows him <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> old-fashioned 19th century blue striped bathing suit, with a straw boat hat, carrying a rubber duck into the outside seal pool at the then-new National Aquarium in Baltimore at the Inner Harbor, attracting wide national media attention, to settle a wager {{that it would not be}} opened in time in August 1981. In 1984, in a move to give the majority African-American population more power in the city of Baltimore, Schaefer named Bishop L. Robinson as the Baltimore City Police Department's first African-American police commissioner, a position previously dominated by Irish American and Italian American members of the city police department.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before the}} end of Robespierre, a new royalist social movement, called the Muscadins had appeared. These were largely upper middle class young men, {{numbering}} between and two and three thousand, who <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> extravagant fashion, spoke with an exaggerated accent, carried canes as weapons, and, particularly in 1794 and 1795, they patrolled the streets in groups and attacked sans culottes and symbols of the revolution. They tried to be and act like the nobility of the Ancien Regime, and mostly tried to live in the abandoned Marais area. One of the most extreme of the revolutionaries, Marat, the editor of the radical newspaper L'Ami du people ("Friend of the people") had been assassinated on 13 July 1793, and on 22 September 1794, his ashes had been placed with great ceremony in the Pantheon, alongside those of Voltaire and Rousseau. After the downfall of Robespierre, the Convention issued a decree that no one should be entered in the Pantheon who had not been dead for ten years. The Muscadins went even further, invading the Pantheon, destroying Marat's monument and removing his ashes.|$|E
500|$|... "The Railway Guard" [...] {{featured}} Leno in a mad characterisation of {{a railway}} station guard <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> ill-fitting uniform, with an unkempt beard and a whistle. The character {{was created by}} exaggerating the behaviour that Leno saw in a real employee at Brixton station who concerned himself in other people's business while, at the same time, not doing any work. [...] "The Shopwalker" [...] was full of comic one-liners and was heavily influenced by pantomime. Leno played {{the part of a}} shop assistant, again of manic demeanour, enticing imaginary clientele into the shop before launching into a frantic selling technique sung in verse. Leno's depiction of [...] "The Waiter", <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> oversized dinner jacket and loose-fitting white dickey, which would flap up and hit his face, was of a man consumed in self-pity and indignation. Overworked, overwrought and overwhelmed by the number of his customers, the waiter gave out excuses for the bad service faster than the customers could complain: ...|$|E

50|$|Generally, drag queens <b>dress</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> female role, often exaggerating certain {{characteristics}} for comic, dramatic or satirical effect.

500|$|Elvis Is Back! {{represented}} a new sound for Presley; it moved him further toward pop music, a direction {{he continued to}} take {{over much of the}} decade. [...] The album features a mixture of genres, including rock, rhythm and blues and pop ballads. Critics generally agreed that Presley had acquired a [...] "deeper, harder voice quality", and said his interpretations were [...] "increasingly sophisticated". The album includes a variety of material; Presley and the session musicians, known as [...] "The Nashville A-Team", had the benefit of recording equipment that was state-of-the-art for its time. Elvis Is Back! was the first Presley album to be released in stereo. The album's front cover shows Presley {{standing in front of a}} blue stage curtain, <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> Army trench coat and smiling as he glances to his left. The back cover features an image of Presley grinning; he is <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> Army regulation fatigue jacket and cap. The inside of the gatefold cover features fifteen photographs of Presley taken at various times during his Army service.|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, Greeley's {{effectiveness}} as {{a reformer}} was undermined by his idiosyncrasies: according to Williams, he [...] "must {{have looked like}} an apparition, a man of eccentric habits <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> old linen coat {{that made him look}} like a farmer who came into town for supplies". [...] Van Deusen wrote, [...] "Greeley's effectiveness as a crusader was limited by some of his traits and characteristics. [...] Culturally deficient, he was to the end ignorant of his own limitations, and this ignorance was a great handicap." ...|$|E

Fassbender's David is dressed similarly to other crew members, but his outfit was given finer lines to produce a more linear appearance. To create a casual, relaxed appearance, Marshall-Green's Holloway was dressed in hoodies, fisherman pants, and flip-flops, while Elba wore a canvas-greased jacket to represent his long career {{at the helm of}} a ship.|$|E
