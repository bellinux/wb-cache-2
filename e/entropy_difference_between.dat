40|$|A long-standing {{limitation}} of first-principles calculations of substitutional alloy phase diagrams is {{the difficulty in}} accounting for lattice vibrations. A survey of the theoretical and experimental literature seeking to quantify the effect of lattice vibrations on phase stability indicates {{that they can be}} significant. Typical vibrational <b>entropy</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> phases are of the order of 0. 1 to 0. 2 kB/atom, which is comparable to the typical values of configurational <b>entropy</b> <b>differences</b> in binary alloys (at most 0. 693 kB/atom). This article presents the basic formalism underlying ab initio phase diagram calculations, along with the generalization required to account for lattice vibrations. The authors review the various techniques allowing the theoretical calculation and the experimental determination of phonon dispersion curves and related thermodynamic quantities, such as vibrational entropy or free energy. A clear picture of the origin of vibrational <b>entropy</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> phases in an alloy system is presented that goes beyond the traditional bond counting and volume change arguments. Vibrational entropy change {{can be attributed to the}} changes in chemical bond stiffness associated with the changes in bond length that take place during a phase transformation. This so-called “bond stiffness vs bond length” interpretation both summarizes the key phenomenon driving vibrational entropy changes and provides a practical tool to model them...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} novel, conceptually simple {{approach}} {{to calculate the}} configurational <b>entropy</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> two conformational ensembles of a molecular system. The method estimates the full-dimensional probability density function of the system by a Gaussian mixture, using an efficient greedy learning algorithm with a cross-validation-based stopping criterion. An evaluation of the method on conformational ensembles corresponding to substates of five small peptide systems shows that excellent agreement is found with the exact entropy differences obtained from a full enumeration of conformations. Compared with the quasiharmonic method and two other, more recently developed methods, the Gaussian mixture method yields more accurate results at smaller sample sizes.

Immunoglobulins and complements, {{the main components}} of the deposits, can be detected by immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy. Previous researches characterized the immune deposits only individually, but not the interactions between them. To study these relationships we analyzed an IF profile of IgG subclasses and complements (IgG 1, IgG 2, IgG 3, IgG 4, C 3, C 1 q, and C 4) in 53 and 95 cases of biopsy-confirmed MLNs and IMNs, respectively, mainly using information theory and Bayesian networks. We identified significant <b>entropy</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> MLN and IMN for all markers except C 3 and IgG 1, but mutual information (a measure of mutual dependence) were not significantly different for all the pairs of markers. The <b>entropy</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> MLN and IMN, therefore, were not attributable to the mutual information. These findings suggest that disease type directly and/or indirectly influences the glomerular deposits of most of IgG subclasses and complements, and that the interactions between any pair of the markers were similar between the two diseases. A Markov chain of IgG subclasses was derived from the mutual information about each pair of IgG subclass. Finally we developed an integrated disease model, consistent with the previous findings, describing the glomerular immune deposits of the IgG subclasses and complements based on a Bayesian network using the Markov chain of IgG subclasses as seed. The relationships between the markers were effectively explored by information theory and Bayesian network. Although deposits of IgG subclasses and complements depended on both disease type and the other markers, the interaction between the markers appears conserved, independent from the disease type. The disease model provided an integrated and intuitive representation of the relationships of the IgG subclasses and complements in MLN and IMN...|$|R

40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} (MD) {{simulations of}} 5 ns on protein-DNA complexes of catabolite-activator protein (CAP), λ-repressor, and their corresponding uncomplexed protein and DNA, are reported. These cases represent two extremes of DNA bending, with CAP DNA bent severely and the λ-operator nearly straight when complexed with protein. The calculations were performed using the AMBER suite {{of programs and}} the parm 94 force field, validated for these studies by good agreement with experimental nuclear magnetic resonance data on DNA. An explicit computational model of structural adaptation and computation of the quasiharmonic entropy of association {{were obtained from the}} MD. The results indicate that, with respect to canonical B-form DNA, the extreme bending of the DNA in the complex with CAP is ∼ 60 % protein-induced and 40 % intrinsic to the sequence-dependent structure of the free oligomer. The DNA in the complex is an energetically strained form, and the MD results are consistent with a conformational-capture mechanism. The calculated quasiharmonic entropy change accounts for the <b>entropy</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the two cases. The calculated entropy was decomposed into contributions from protein adaptation, DNA adaptation, and protein-DNA structural correlations. The origin of the <b>entropy</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> CAP and λ-repressor complexation arises more from the additional protein adaptation in the case of λ, than to DNA bending and entropy contribution from DNA bending.

This is particularly evident in the elastic moduli, which at room temperature can become as much as four times softer. In order to get more insight into the mechanisms involved in such elastic aging and full recovering with mild annealing at 600 - 800 K, the effect of La doping on PZT with 4. 6 % Ti is studied with anelastic measurements.

40|$|Quantifying {{complexity}} {{from heart}} rate variability (HRV) series is a challenging task, and multiscale entropy (MSE), along with its variants, has been demonstrated {{to be one of}} the most robust approaches to achieve this goal. Although physical training is known to be beneficial, there is little information about the long-term complexity changes induced by the physical conditioning. The present study aimed to quantify the changes in physiological complexity elicited by physical training through multiscale entropy-based complexity measurements. Rats were subject to a protocol of medium intensity training (n = 13) or a sedentary protocol (n = 12). One-hour HRV series were obtained from all conscious rats five days after the experimental protocol. We estimated MSE, multiscale dispersion entropy (MDE) and multiscale SDiff q from HRV series. Multiscale SDiff q is a recent approach that accounts for <b>entropy</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> a given time series and its shuffled dynamics. From SDiff q, three attributes (q-attributes) were derived, namely SDiff q m a x, q m a x and q z e r o.
