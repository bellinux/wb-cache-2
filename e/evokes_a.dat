5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} (cave hyena subspecies) is {{depicted}} in {{a few examples of}} Upper Palaeolithic rock art in France. A painting from the Chauvet Cave depicts a hyena outlined and represented in profile, with two legs, with its head and front part with well distinguishable spotted coloration pattern. Because of the specimen's steeped profile, it is thought that the painting was originally meant to represent a cave bear, but was modified as a hyena. In Lascaux, a red and black rock painting of a hyena is present in the part of the cave known as the Diverticule axial, and {{is depicted in}} profile, with four limbs, showing an animal with a steep back. The body and the long neck have spots, including the flanks. An image on a cave in Ariège shows an incompletely outlined and deeply engraved figure, representing a part of an elongated neck, smoothly passing into part of the animal’s forelimb on the proximal side. Its head is in profile, with a possibly re-engraved muzzle. The ear is typical of the spotted hyena, as it is rounded. An image in the Le Gabillou Cave in Dordogne shows a deeply engraved zoomorphic figure with a head in frontal view and an elongated neck with part of the forelimb in profile. It has large round eyes and short, rounded ears which are set far from each other. It has a broad, line-like mouth that <b>evokes</b> <b>a</b> smile. Though originally thought to represent a composite or zoomorphic hybrid, it is probable it is a spotted hyena based on its broad muzzle and long neck.|$|E

25|$|Salivary glands are innervated, either {{directly}} or indirectly, by the parasympathetic and sympathetic arms of the autonomic nervous system. Parasympathetic stimulation <b>evokes</b> <b>a</b> copious flow of saliva. In contrast, sympathetic stimulation produces either a small flow, which is rich in protein, or no flow at all.|$|E
50|$|In van Gogh’s {{first year}} in Paris he painted rural areas around Montmartre, such as the butte and its windmills.

The internal and external elements of St Paul's combine to create a cohesive and finely detailed whole.|$|E

Aphrodite <b>evokes</b> <b>a</b> majestic {{image of the}} sea, and Tam O'Shanter (based on the tale by Robert Burns) {{is a work of}} musical story-telling of similar caliber as some of Richard Strauss's pieces, such as the latter's Don Quixote.|$|E
25|$|The {{composer}} deliberately {{made the}} titles vague, {{so that they}} are not associated with specific tales or voyages of Sinbad. However, in the epigraph to the finale, he does make reference to the adventure of Prince Ajib. In a later edition, he did away with titles altogether, desiring instead that the listener should hear his work only as an Oriental-themed symphonic music that <b>evokes</b> <b>a</b> sense of the fairy-tale adventure.|$|E

25|$|According to Stephen Hill, {{co-founder of}} a radio show called Hearts of Space, the term is used to {{describe}} music that <b>evokes</b> <b>a</b> feeling of contemplative spaciousness. Hill states that space music can range in character, the sonic texture of the music can be simple or complex, it can be instrumental or electronic, it may lack conventional melodic, harmonic, or rhythmic features, and may be less concerned with the formal compositional schemes associated with other styles of music. Hill proposes that space music can be found within {{a wide range of}} genres. Some claim that music from the western classical, world, Celtic, traditional, experimental and other idioms also falls within the definition of space music.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{architectural}} detailing along Main Street has survived the years. Main Street between North Avenue and Huguenot Street <b>evokes</b> <b>a</b> {{strong sense of}} the 1920s and 30s with numerous structures built in the Art Deco architectural style. New Rochelle's downtown area has the most contiguous group of commercial buildings of this period. Significant buildings include the Bank of New Rochelle Building, the Lambden Building, Talner Jewelers, two historic former theater buildings (RKO and Lowe's), the first suburban branch department store location of both Bloomingdales and Arnold Constable, & Co., and several major Art Deco commercial buildings such as the Kaufman Building, home of the nations first cartoon studio Terrytoons, and a building associated {{with one of the}} nations first motion picture houses, Thanhouser Company.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, various {{governments have}} spearheaded {{the concept of}} {{developing}} architectural projects, sometimes ostentatious ones, designed by renowned architects–for example, the remodeling of the Plaza de España in Santa Cruz de Tenerife by the Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron. Other examples include the Playa de Las Teresitas project by the Frenchman Dominique Perrault; the center known as Magma Arte & Congresos; the Torres de Santa Cruz; and the Auditorio de Tenerife ("Auditorium of Tenerife"). The latter, by the Spaniard Santiago Calatrava, lies {{to the east of}} the Parque Marítimo ("Maritime Park"), in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, and is characterized by its sail-like structure, which <b>evokes</b> <b>a</b> boat, and has become a symbol for the city and island, which makes Santa Cruz de Tenerife one of the Spanish cities with the most futuristic buildings.|$|E

40|$|In two experiments, {{the authors}} {{investigated}} the interpersonal effects {{of anger and}} disappointment in negotiations. Whereas previous research focused on the informational inferences that bargainers make based on others' emotions, this article {{emphasizes the importance of}} affective reactions. The findings of this study show that anger <b>evoked</b> <b>a</b> complementary emotion (fear) in targets when reported by a high-power bargainer but <b>evoked</b> <b>a</b> reciprocal emotion (anger) when reported by a low-power bargainer. This reciprocal anger led participants to offer less to low-power counterparts who reported anger. Disappointed bargainers, however, <b>evoked</b> <b>a</b> complementary emotion (guilt) in participants and increased offers, regardless of the bargainer's power position...|$|R

25|$|While the {{possibility}} that certain individuals may be born with musical deficits {{is not a new}} notion, the first documented case of congenital amusia was published relatively recently. The study was conducted with a female volunteer, referred to as Monica, who declared herself to be musically impaired in response to an advertisement in the newspaper. Monica had no psychiatric or neurological history, nor did she have any hearing loss. MRI scans showed no abnormalities. Monica also scored above average on a standard intelligence test, and her working memory was evaluated and found to be normal. However, Monica suffers from a lifelong inability to recognize or perceive music, which has persisted even after involvement with music through church choir and band during her childhood and teenage years. Monica even admits that she does not enjoy listening to music because, to her, it sounds like noise and <b>evokes</b> <b>a</b> stressful response.|$|E

The walkway to the Head of Household room <b>evokes</b> <b>a</b> giant library. The Head of Household room is an exotic island oasis. The headboard is made from a surfboard, there are Hula girl table lamps, rattan carpet and Polynesian knickknacks. The boat bedroom features shelves and chests designed to resemble small rowboats with rowboat shaped beds. Two large beds made of actual unfinished tree branches with pink bedspreads fill another room. The living room features a giant green semi-circular sofa, and a stone wall fireplace. A red colored room connected directly to the living room by a short hallway, with no doors, has a pair of pullout couches rather than actual beds. New this season is a Spa room complete with a massage table, two-person sauna and lounge. The spa room would be featured in numerous subsequent seasons. Outside, there is a hot tub and pool, a billiards table and lounge area. The lounge area features a fire pit and heated lamps. Along with work-out equipment, there are lawn chairs to lay out in the sun. The outside also includes the washing machine and clothes dryer, both of which are covered overhead.|$|E

40|$|This {{study used}} {{kinematics}} {{to investigate the}} integration between vision and olfaction during grasping movements. Participants were requested to smell an odorant and then grasp an object presented in central vision. The results indicate that if the target was small (e. g., a strawberry), the time and amplitude of maximum hand aperture were later and greater, respectively, when the odor <b>evoked</b> <b>a</b> larger object (e. g., an orange) than when the odor <b>evoked</b> <b>an</b> object of a similar size as the target or no odor was presented. Conversely, the time and amplitude of maximum hand aperture were earlier and reduced, respectively, when the target was large (e. g., a peach) and the odor <b>evoked</b> <b>a</b> smaller sized object (e. g., an almond) than when the odor <b>evoked</b> <b>an</b> object of a similar size as the target or no odor was presented. Taken together, these results support the evidence of cross-modal links between olfaction and vision and extend this notion to goal-directed actions...|$|R

25|$|Liszt's own {{point of}} view {{regarding}} programme music can for the time of his youth be taken from the preface of the Album d'un voyageur (1837). According to this, <b>a</b> landscape could <b>evoke</b> <b>a</b> certain kind of mood. Since a piece of music could also <b>evoke</b> <b>a</b> mood, a mysterious resemblance with the landscape could be imagined. In this sense the music would not paint the landscape, but it would match the landscape in a third category, the mood.|$|R
