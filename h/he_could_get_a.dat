5|$|In court Denning {{preferred}} to let counsel talk on {{for as long}} as they wanted to so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> grasp of the situation without wading through irrelevant court papers; to prevent them going on too long he sat quietly and allowed them to wind down at their own pace.|$|E
5|$|A {{crowd of}} several {{thousand}} gathered outside the courthouse while Lockett's trial was underway. A cameraman asked {{a large group of}} those gathered to shake their fists and yell so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> picture. The rest of the crowd mistakenly believed they were storming the courthouse and rushed forward. In the ensuing skirmish, one policeman was injured so badly that his arm later had to be amputated. The National Guard opened fire, killing six people and wounding approximately fifty. Some members of the mob looted nearby stores in search of weapons to retaliate, but reinforcements arrived from a nearby army post by mid-afternoon. Martial law was declared, and no further violence was perpetrated. A month later, Lockett was executed at the Kentucky State Penitentiary in Eddyville.|$|E
5|$|Bryant and Milam {{were indicted}} for murder. The grand jury's prosecuting attorney, Hamilton Caldwell, was not {{confident}} that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> conviction {{in a case}} of white violence against a black male accused of insulting a white woman. A local black paper was surprised at the indictment and praised the decision, as did the New York Times. The high-profile comments published in Northern newspapers and by the NAACP were of concern to the prosecuting attorney, Gerald Chatham; he worried that his office {{would not be able to}} secure a guilty verdict, despite the compelling evidence. Having limited funds, Bryant and Milam initially had difficulty finding attorneys to represent them, but five attorneys at a Sumner law firm offered their services pro bono. Their supporters placed collection jars in stores and other public places in the Delta, eventually gathering $10,000 for the defense.|$|E

60|$|Filled with nameless dread, Kurt rushed out. He {{saw nothing}} unusual, heard nothing. Rapidly {{he walked out}} through the yard, and {{suddenly}} he saw a glow in the sky above the barns. Then he ran, so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> unobstructed view of the valley.|$|R

The deal with Baltai was worth zero LTL (he played there for free). In his first game back after his injury, against Kalev/Cramo, he scored 16 points, grabbed 2 rebounds, and led Baltai to a victory.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, Davis was {{starring}} in Golden Boy {{at night and}} shooting his own New York-based afternoon talk show during the day. When <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> day off from the theater, he recorded songs in the studio, performed at charity events in Chicago, Miami, or Las Vegas, or appeared on television variety specials in Los Angeles. Davis felt he was cheating his family of his company, {{but he said he}} was incapable of standing still.|$|E
25|$|In September 1941, {{he asked}} John Ryle, {{the brother of}} the philosopher Gilbert Ryle, if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> manual job at Guy's Hospital in London. John Ryle was {{professor}} of medicine at Cambridge and had been involved in helping Guy's prepare for the Blitz. Wittgenstein told Ryle he would die slowly if left at Cambridge, and he would rather die quickly. He started working at Guy's shortly afterwards as a dispensary porter, meaning that he delivered drugs from the pharmacy to the wards—where he apparently advised the patients not to take them.|$|E

25|$|On June 7, 2012, 16-year-old Yasser Lopez made {{national}} news when he successfully underwent a delicate 3-hour neurosurgical operation {{to remove a}} spear that a speargun had fired into his skull when it was accidentally discharged during a fishing trip; 3 feet of the spear protruded from the wound above his eye socket, and that part had to be specially cut off so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> brain CT scan. Miraculously, no major blood vessels were harmed and the only impairments thus far are amnesia for the period during and around the event, which is somewhat normal, and some sluggishness in a hand.|$|E
25|$|Vijaya had {{no other}} {{children}} after Kuveni's departure. When he grew old, he became concerned that he would die heirless. So, he decided to bring his twin brother Sumitta from India, to govern his kingdom. He {{sent a letter to}} Sumitta, but by the time <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> reply, he died. His ministers from Upatissagama then governed the kingdom for a year, while awaiting a reply. Meanwhile, in Sinhapura, Sumitta had become the king, and had three sons. His queen was a daughter of the king of Madda (possibly Madra). When Vijaya's messengers arrived, he was himself very old. So, he requested one of his sons to depart for Lanka. His youngest son, Panduvasdeva, volunteered to go. Panduvasdeva and 32 sons of Sumitta's ministers reached Lanka, where Panduvasdeva became the new ruler.|$|E
25|$|During the {{communist}} era, travelling to the West {{was a long}} process for Hungarian citizens. The {{first step was to}} obtain an invitation, preferably from a relative in the country to be visited, and a promise of full financial support. With such an invitation, and assuming <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> passport, a Hungarian could travel westwards once a year. However, in the absence of such an invitation, he could travel to the West only once every three years. The Communist-era visa restrictions restricted Hungarian artists and musicians since it hindered their ability to travel abroad. As a result, many chose to leave Hungary and settle in the West, such as famed cellist János Starker, who emigrated to the United States in 1948 because it was impossible for him to tour abroad with a Hungarian passport.|$|E

50|$|Mozart had no {{affiliation}} with the Emperor's Italian opera company and had to work for some time before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> opera commission. A failed early effort was the fragment Lo sposo deluso (1783), for which he wrote five numbers before abandoning the project. The marginal notes in the score indicate that Mozart was writing with specific singers in mind, including Benucci.|$|R
25|$|After {{asking a}} flight {{attendant}} for permission to move to seat 26K, saying <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> better view from that seat, Yousef moved to that seat and tucked the assembled bomb into the life vest pocket under that seat. He exited the aircraft in Cebu. Philippine domestic Flight Attendant Maria De La Cruz noticed that Yousef had switched seats {{during the course of}} the Manila to Cebu flight and got off the plane in Cebu with the domestic cabin crew, but did not pass the information along to the international flight crew that boarded at Cebu for the trip to Tokyo. 25 other passengers also got off the plane at Cebu, where 256 more passengers and a new cabin crew boarded the plane for the final leg of the flight to Tokyo.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{with the}} October 24, 1937 radio show, where Jack proudly {{announced}} {{the purchase of}} his car, a running joke was that Benny drove an old Maxwell automobile, a brand that {{went out of business}} in 1925. Although some details such as the car's body style and its exact model year would vary over the years, what remained constant was that Benny's old car was so worn out that it would barely run, but the miserly Benny insisted <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> few more miles out of it. Many of the sound effects for the car’s clattering engine came from an actual old motor which the sound effects shop had salvaged from a Los Angeles junkyard. When a sound effects man missed a cue for the automobile engine, Mel Blanc quickly improvised a vocal imitation of a sputtering car engine starting up noisily that was so funny it became a regular feature of the show.|$|E

50|$|He {{lived for}} the {{remainder}} of his life, writing poems, and playing wherever <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> engagement in the vicinity. His earnings were scanty, but his wants were few, and his amiable, simple character, and poetic talent, made him many friends. One of the best and truest was Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Slack. Slack was a bookseller, and publisher of the Newcastle Chronicle. Cunningham supplemented his income by writing articles for publication.|$|R
500|$|With {{a script}} in hand, Mani Ratnam {{had an idea}} to either get a {{producer}} for his film or to narrate the script to a [...] "celebrated" [...] film-maker, so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> chance to work along with them {{and get to know}} about the various aspects involved in film-making. He chose three directors—Balachander, Bharathiraja, and Mahendran. As the attempts to meet and convince all the three proved to be unsuccessful, he decided to look out for a producer. In the process, he along with P. C. Sreeram—who would collaborate with him in most of his future projects—met around 20 people; however, all the efforts turned out to be unsuccessful.|$|E
500|$|Furthermore, Chamberlain damaged his {{reputation}} in an April 1965 article with Sports Illustrated. In an interview entitled [...] "My Life in a Bush League", he criticized his fellow players, coaches, and NBA administrators. Chamberlain later commented {{that he could}} see in hindsight how the interview could have been instrumental in hurting his public image. However, contemporary colleagues were often terrified to play against Chamberlain. Bill Russell regularly feared being embarrassed by Chamberlain, Walt Frazier called his dominance on the court [...] "comical", and when 6ft 11in 250-pound (in his early years) Hall-of-Fame center Bob Lanier was asked about the most memorable moment of his career, Lanier answered: [...] "When Wilt Chamberlain lifted me up and moved me like a coffee cup so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> favorable position." ...|$|E
500|$|While the Haywood {{defendants}} awaited trial, Borah {{and others}} were indicted in federal court for land fraud, {{having to do with}} the acquisition by the Barber Lumber Company (for which Borah had been counsel) of title to timber land claims. [...] Individuals had filed for the claims, and then sold them to the Barber Company although they had sworn that the claims were for their own use. As the United States Attorney for Idaho, Norman M. Ruick, had expanded the grand jury from 12 members to 22 before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> majority vote [...] to indict Borah (by a 12—10 margin), the accusation was immediately deemed political, with Ruick acting on behalf of Idaho Republicans who had lost state party leadership to the new senator. Roosevelt took a wait-and-see attitude, upsetting Borah, who considered resigning his Senate seat even if exonerated.|$|E

500|$|On July 27, the Japanese {{government}} considered how {{to respond}} to the Declaration. The four military members of the Big Six wanted to reject it, but Tōgō persuaded the cabinet not to do so until <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> reaction from the Soviets. In a telegram, Shun'ichi Kase, Japan's ambassador to Switzerland, observed that [...] "unconditional surrender" [...] applied only to the military and not to the government or the people, and he pleaded that it should be understood that the careful language of Potsdam appeared [...] "to have occasioned a great deal of thought" [...] {{on the part of the}} signatory governments—"they seem to have taken pains to save face for us on various points." [...] The next day, Japanese newspapers reported that the Declaration, the text of which had been broadcast and dropped by leaflet into Japan, had been rejected.

The press speculated that she would soon have to make a decision between acting and singing. Shortly after, Minogue chose to concentrate on her burgeoning music career and decided to leave Neighbours after two and a half years. She filmed her final scenes in June 1988. Charlene's exit storyline saw her move to Brisbane, after her grandfather, Dan (Syd Conabere), bought her and Scott a house there. Scott was initially unable to go with his wife, so she said goodbye to him, on the understanding that he would join her as soon as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> job transfer. All of the cast gathered in the street, while Charlene said goodbye to her brother, mother and friends. She then got into her green Mini and drove out of Ramsay Street.|$|E
500|$|Ross also {{excelled in}} baseball, football, {{lacrosse}} and motorcycle racing. Before {{he became a}} hockey executive, he had {{a career as a}} bank clerk and ran a sporting-goods store in Montreal. Ross had moved to Brandon, Manitoba, in 1905 at the advice of his parents so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> job with a bank, with a salary of $600 per year. He gave that career up when he began playing hockey professionally. He was married to Muriel, a native of Montreal, and had two sons, Art and John. During the Second World War, both sons served in the Royal Canadian Air Force. After the war Ross made his son Art the business manager for the Bruins. Ross was named coach and manager of the Boston Bruins in 1924 and moved his family to Brookline, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston, after being hired. In 1928, he served as the traveling secretary of the Boston Braves baseball team, which was owned by Bruins owner Charles Adams. [...] He became a naturalized American citizen on April 22, 1938. On August 5, 1964, Ross died at a nursing home in Medford, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston, at the age of 79. A sister, both his sons, and three grandchildren survived him.|$|E
