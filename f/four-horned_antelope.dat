5|$|The <b>four-horned</b> <b>antelope</b> differs {{greatly from}} the nilgai in colour, {{is much smaller}} and has an extra pair of horns. The nilgai is nearly nine times heavier and two times taller than the <b>four-horned</b> <b>antelope.</b> Two deer species, the Indian muntjac and the hog deer, can be {{confused}} with this antelope. The <b>four-horned</b> <b>antelope,</b> however, lacks their antlers. The chinkara, a gazelle, can be told apart by its light brown coat and larger, ringed horns.|$|E
5|$|The <b>four-horned</b> <b>antelope</b> is diurnal (active mainly {{during the}} day), though it mainly rests or ruminates in dense {{undergrowth}} at noon. Though solitary by nature, the <b>four-horned</b> <b>antelope</b> may form loose {{groups of three}} to five. Groups consist {{of one or more}} adults, sometimes accompanied by juveniles. Males and females hardly interact, except in the mating season.|$|E
5|$|The <b>four-horned</b> <b>antelope</b> is {{the sole}} member of the genus Tetracerus, and is placed under the family Bovidae. The species was first {{described}} by French zoologist Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville in 1816. The <b>four-horned</b> <b>antelope</b> has only one other relative in the tribe Boselaphini, the nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus). The Boselaphini have the horns with a keel {{on the front and}} lack rings as found in other antelope groups.|$|E
50|$|Bandipur {{supports}} a good population of endangered and vulnerable species like Indian elephants, gaurs, tigers, sloth bears, muggers, Indian rock pythons, <b>four-horned</b> <b>antelopes,</b> jackals and dholes.|$|R
50|$|The park {{also has}} {{a good number of}} golden jackals (Canis aureus), grey {{mongoose}} (Herpestes edwardsi), sloth bears (Melursus ursinus), striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena), spotted deer or chital (Axis axis), sambar (Cervus unicolor), barking deer (Munitacus muntjak), <b>four-horned</b> <b>antelopes</b> (Tetracercus quadricornis) and wild boar (Sus scrofa).|$|R
50|$|Apart from {{numerous}} wild boars also sambar deer, red muntjac, hog deer and herds of chital inhabit the park. <b>Four-horned</b> <b>antelopes</b> reside predominantly in the hills. Rhesus monkeys, hanuman langurs, Indian pangolins, Indian porcupines, {{several species of}} flying squirrels, black-naped hares and endangered hispid hares are also present.|$|R
5|$|The <b>four-horned</b> <b>antelope</b> is {{threatened}} {{by the loss of}} its natural habitat due to agricultural expansion. Moreover, the unusual four-horned skull and the horns have been a popular target for trophy hunters. In India, the species is protected under Schedule I the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 and the Nepalese population is listed in CITES Appendix III. The <b>four-horned</b> <b>antelope</b> is classified as Vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|Four-horned antelopes tend {{to inhabit}} areas with {{significant}} grass cover or heavy undergrowth, and avoid human settlements. Earlier common throughout deciduous forests in India, the antelope now occurs in widely disjunct, small populations. Most of the populations are in India, and lower numbers {{can be found}} in adjoining Nepal.

5|$|Evidence {{of early}} humans hunting <b>four-horned</b> <b>antelope</b> during the Mesolithic period (5,000 to 8,000 years ago) {{have been found}} in the Kurnool caves of {{southern}} India and similar evidence has been found from the Chalcolithic period (3,000 years ago) in Orissa, eastern India.|$|E
50|$|The {{forest is}} home to several {{carnivorous}} animals like, leopards, wild dogs {{and a few others}} like, jackals, wolves, civet cats as well. The herbivorous animals in the forest include, wild boars, sambar deer, chital, barking deer, rhesus monkey and <b>four-horned</b> <b>antelopes.</b> Birds such as peacocks and jungle fowl are also found in the forests.|$|R
5|$|Major {{protected}} areas across India where <b>four-horned</b> <b>antelopes</b> occur include: Gir National Park (Gujarat); Bandhavgarh National Park, Bori Wildlife Sanctuary, Kanha National Park, Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve, Panna Tiger Reserve, Pench Tiger Reserve, Sanjay National Park, Satpura National Park (Madhya Pradesh); Tadoba Andhari Reserve (Maharashtra); Kumbhalgarh Wildlife Sanctuary, Ranthambore National Park, Rangayyanadurga wildlife sanctuary (Karnataka), and Sariska Tiger Reserve (Rajasthan).|$|R
5|$|The {{antelope}} is shy and elusive. When alarmed, {{it stands}} motionless and may nervously leap {{away from the}} danger or even sprint. It often conceals itself in tall grasses to escape predators. The use of alarm calls to alert others is not common because the antelope tries to avoid the attention of predators. However, in extreme cases, these calls {{may be used to}} warn predators that they have been identified. Adults mark vegetation in their territories with a colourless secretion of preorbital glands, that soon condenses to form a white film. They maintain multiple latrine sites where piles of their pellet droppings are formed by regular use. Latrine sites can be confused with those of the barking deer but the pellets are longer and larger in <b>four-horned</b> <b>antelopes.</b> Submissive display consists of shrinking the body, lowering the head and pulling the ears back. Predators of <b>four-horned</b> <b>antelopes</b> include tigers, leopards, and dholes.|$|R
5|$|The <b>four-horned</b> <b>{{antelope}}</b> {{feeds on}} grasses, herbs, shrubs, foliage, flowers and fruits. A study in Mudumalai National Park (Tamil Nadu, India) {{showed that the}} antelope prefers grass species of the family Cyperaceae; genera Axonopus, Cynodon, Digitaria, Echinochloa, Panicum, Sehima and Sporobolus; and the species Imperata cylindrica, Ottochloa nodosa, Pseudanthistria umbellata and Themeda cymbaria. The shrub Grewia hirsuta is frequently eaten. Preferred herbs include Helichrysum, Indigofera and Tinospora species and Leucas aspera. The <b>four-horned</b> <b>antelope</b> feeds on the leaves of trees such as Cordia wallichii, Emblica officinalis, Randia dumetorum and Zizyphus xylopyrus. Grasses comprise nearly 29 percent of the diet, followed by foliage from trees (nearly nine percent). Grass and browse were consumed in nearly equal proportions. A study in the Panna National Park (Madhya Pradesh, India) showed preference for Zizyphus mauritiana, Acacia nilotica, A. leucophloea and A. catechu. Babool flowers were frequently eaten. The antelope often associates with langurs under fruiting trees, just as chital frequently do. Interaction with chital, a sympatric species, was infrequent. The antelope is wary when feeding, often raising its head and looking about its vicinity. The <b>four-horned</b> <b>antelope</b> needs to drink water frequently; as such it stays in places near water sources.|$|E
5|$|The <b>four-horned</b> <b>antelope</b> inhabits {{areas with}} {{significant}} cover from grasses or heavy undergrowth, {{and close to}} water bodies. It generally keeps away from human-inhabited areas. Though they are habitat generalists, four-horned antelopes mostly occur in open, dry, deciduous forests in hilly terrain.|$|E
5|$|The <b>four-horned</b> <b>antelope</b> is diurnal (active mainly {{during the}} day). Though solitary by nature, four-horned antelopes may form loose {{groups of three}} to five â€“with one or more adults, {{sometimes}} accompanied by juveniles. This elusive antelope feeds on grasses, herbs, shrubs, foliage, flowers and fruits. It needs to drink water frequently; as such it stays in places near water sources. The breeding behaviour of the <b>four-horned</b> <b>antelope</b> has not been well studied. The age at which they reach sexual maturity and the season when mating occurs have not been understood well. Gestation lasts about eight months, following which one or two calves are born. They are kept concealed {{for the first few}} weeks of their birth. The young remain with the mother for about a year.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 {{wildlife}} {{survey conducted}} by Government of Tamil Nadu enumerated 10 Bengal tigers, 866 Indian elephants, 672 gaurs, and 27 leopards. The survey party observed four additional species of horned antelope including 2,348 spotted deer, 1,068 blackbucks, 304 sambar deer, 77 barking deer and <b>four-horned</b> <b>antelopes,</b> 843 wild boars, 43 sloth bears and 15 striped hyenas. Herds of the famous feral buffaloes can also be spotted in places near the Moyar river.|$|R
40|$|<b>Four-horned</b> <b>Antelopes,</b> {{commonly}} known as Chowsingha, are unique mammals. Unfortunately the reports on its distribution patter and habitat preferences are still scanty from south Rajasthan. The present study {{is an attempt to}} fill up such gaps of this animal in Kumbhalgarh Wildlife Sanctuary. Results revealed that Chowsingha is present in only four forests blocks out of Thirty four. The relation between the observed distribution pattern, preferred habitats and ecological boundaries of the sanctuary have been tried to correlate...|$|R
50|$|Permanent {{residents}} include as predators sloth bear, panther, and wolf. Jackal and hyena {{are common}} scavengers. Large herds of gaur and chital are commonly seen. Large families of langurs are an ever present attraction, as are rhesus monkeys.Other animals {{to be found}} in the NP are mouse deer, sambhar, <b>four-horned</b> <b>antelopes,</b> nilgai, kakar, small Indian civets, ant eating pangolin, porcupine and mongoose.At last decades white tigers were found rarely. To save such rare species they were transported to other zoo(s).|$|R
5|$|Slender {{with thin}} legs {{and a short}} tail, the <b>four-horned</b> <b>antelope</b> has a {{yellowish}} brown to reddish coat. The underparts and the insides of the legs are white. Facial features include black markings on the muzzle and behind the ears. A black stripe marks the outer surface of each leg. Females have four teats far back on the abdomen. The hair feels coarse, more {{like that of a}} deer than the glossy hair typical of antelopes. The fetlocks are marked with white patches.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} nilgai is Boselaphus tragocamelus. The nilgai is the sole member of the genus Boselaphus {{and placed in the}} family Bovidae. The species was described and given its binomial name by the German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas in 1766. He based his description on a 1745 account of a male nilgai by British physician James Parsons in the 43rd volume of Philosophical Transactions (now known as the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society). The nilgai has one other relative in the tribe Boselaphini, the <b>four-horned</b> <b>antelope</b> (the sole member of Tetracerus).|$|E
5|$|Earlier common {{throughout}} deciduous {{forests in}} India, four-horned antelopes are now found in low numbers. Their numbers were estimated at slightly above 10,000 in 2001, and are feared to be decreasing. In Mudumalai National Park, the populations are low and scattered. Their numbers in Gir National Park were estimated at 256 individuals in 1974; later estimates at waterholes {{in the same}} location put them a little above 1000. Densities of above 0.7 individuals per km2 have been considered as being healthy. Presently the <b>four-horned</b> <b>antelope</b> is confined to the Indian subcontinent, occurring widely in disjunct and small populations. The range in India covers a vast expanse, from {{the foothills of the}} Himalayas in the north to the Deccan Plateau in the south. Most of the existing populations are in India, and lower numbers in adjoining Nepal.|$|E
50|$|The Sathyamangalam forests {{link the}} Eastern Ghats and Western Ghats {{allowing}} gene flow between diverse fauna {{populations of the}} two eco-regions.

5|$|Excepting some domesticated forms, {{all male}} bovids have horns, {{and in many}} species, females, too, possess horns. The {{size and shape of}} the horns vary greatly, but the basic {{structure}} is a pair of simple bony protrusions without branches, often having a spiral, twisted, or fluted form, each covered in a permanent sheath of keratin. Although horns occur in a single pair on almost all bovid species, there are exceptions such as the <b>four-horned</b> <b>antelope</b> and the Jacob sheep. The unique horn structure is the only unambiguous morphological feature of bovids that distinguishes them from other pecorans. A high correlation exists between horn morphology and fighting behaviour of the individual. For instance, long horns are intended for wrestling and fencing, whereas curved horns are used in ramming. Males with horns directed inwards are monogamous and solitary, while those with horns directed outwards tend to be polygynous. These results were independent of body size.|$|E
25|$|The main herbivores of Gir are chital, nilgai, sambar, <b>four-horned</b> <b>antelope,</b> {{chinkara}} {{and wild}} boar. Blackbucks {{from the surrounding}} area are sometimes seen in the sanctuary.|$|E
25|$|The {{large areas}} of {{remaining}} forest on the plateau are still home {{to a variety of}} grazing animals from the <b>four-horned</b> <b>antelope</b> (Tetracerus quadricornis), chinkara (Gazella bennettii), and blackbuck (Antilope cervicapra) to the large gaur and wild water buffalo (Bubalus arena).|$|E
50|$|The {{biological}} subfamily Bovinae {{includes a}} diverse group of 10 genera of medium to large-sized ungulates, including domestic cattle, bison, African buffalo, the water buffalo, the yak, and the <b>four-horned</b> and spiral-horned <b>antelopes.</b> The evolutionary relationship between the members of the group is still debated, and their classification into loose tribes rather than formal subgroups reflects this uncertainty. General characteristics include cloven hoofs and usually {{at least one of the}} sexes of a species having true horns. The largest extant bovine is the gaur.|$|R
25|$|The main animals {{found at}} Bhimbandh Wildlife Sanctuary are tigers, panthers, wild boars, sloth bear, sambar deer, chitals, <b>four-horned</b> <b>antelope</b> and nilgais. However, the {{sanctuary}} is more {{famous for its}} bird life rather than the land animals. It is {{home to more than}} 100 species of resident birds, which stay here all year around. The number increases in the winter migratory season when there is an influx of birds from the Central Asia region.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} animals {{are found in}} the state are tigers, black panthers, leopards, gaur, sloth bears, sambar, <b>four-horned</b> <b>antelope,</b> blue bull, chital, barking deer, mouse deer, civet cats, jackals, jungle cats, striped hyena, and hare. Other animals in the state include {{reptiles}} such as lizards, cobras and kraits.

25|$|Human development, mostly agriculture, has {{replaced}} {{nearly all of}} the original natural vegetation of the Ganges basin. More than 95% of the upper Gangetic Plain has been degraded or converted to agriculture or urban areas. Only one large block of relatively intact habitat remains, running along the Himalayan foothills and including Rajaji National Park, Jim Corbett National Park, and Dudhwa National Park. As recently as the 16th and 17th centuries the upper Gangetic Plain harboured impressive populations of wild Asian elephants (Elephas maximus), Bengal tigers (Panthera t. tigris), Indian rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis), gaurs (Bos gaurus), barasinghas (Rucervus duvaucelii), sloth bears (Melursus ursinus) and Indian lions (Panthera leo persica). In the 21st century there are few large wild animals, mostly deer, wild boars, wildcats, and small numbers of Indian wolves, golden jackals, and red and Bengal foxes. Bengal tigers survive only in the Sundarbans area of the Ganges Delta. The Sundarbands freshwater swamp ecoregion, however, is nearly extinct. Threatened mammals in the upper Gangetic Plain include the tiger, elephant, sloth bear, and <b>four-horned</b> <b>antelope</b> (Tetracerus quadricornis).|$|E
500|$|The <b>four-horned</b> <b>antelope</b> {{is one of}} the {{smallest}} Asian bovids.

500|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} <b>four-horned</b> <b>antelope</b> is Tetracerus quadricornis. The generic name Tetracerus is the combination of two Greek words: tetra ("four") and [...] ceros ("horned"). The specific name quadricornis is derived from two Latin words: quadri ("four") and cornu ("horned"). The <b>four-horned</b> <b>antelope</b> is known by several vernacular names: chausingha, chowsingha, chousingha (Hindi for [...] "four horns"), doda, ghutri (mainly in central India) (Hindi); kondu kuri (Kannada); chauka (Nepalese); nari komboo marn (Tamil).|$|E

500|$|Though Boselaphini has no African {{representation}} today, fossil {{evidence supports}} {{its presence in}} the continent during {{as early as the}} late Miocene â€“ the two living antelopes of this tribe, in fact, have been found to have a closer relationship with the earliest bovids (like Eotragus species) than do the other bovids. This tribe originated at least 8.9 Mya, in much the same area where the <b>four-horned</b> <b>antelope</b> occurs today, and may represent the most [...] "primitive" [...] of all living bovids, having changed the least since the origins of the family. The extant and extinct boselaphine forms show similar development of the horn cores (the central bony part of the horn). It is thought that ancestral bovids had a diploid chromosome number of 58 which has reduced in Tetracerus to 38 through a process of concatenation of some chromosomes.|$|E
