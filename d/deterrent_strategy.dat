40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether there is a relationship between state policies on Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), declines in both TANF and Medicaid caseloads, and the {{rise in the number of}} uninsured. METHODS: Extant data sources of state TANF policies, TANF and Medicaid participation, and uninsurance rates were analyzed, with the state as the unit of analysis. The independent variables included state TANF policies that directly address receipt of benefits or relate to health; dependent variables included changes in state TANF enrollment, Medicaid enrollment, and health insurance status since the enactment of the law. RESULTS: In the bivariate analysis, declines in Medicaid were associated with sanction for work noncompliance, lack of a child care guarantee, and strategies to deter TANF enrollment; this last factor was also associated with increased uninsurance. In the multivariate analysis, lack of a child care guarantee and <b>deterrent</b> <b>strategies</b> predicted TANF declines; <b>deterrent</b> <b>strategies</b> predicted Medicaid decline and uninsurance increases. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that policies deterring TANF enrollment may contribute to declines in Medicaid and increased uninsurance. To maintain health insurance for the poor, policymakers should consider revising policies that deter TANF enrollment...|$|R

40|$|In its {{relations}} with Taiwan and China, Washington has begun to implement separate dual strategies in order to simultaneously deter unilateral action while balancing out the rival political and military forces of each side. A simple standard strategy just {{is not sufficient to}} maintain the status quo. The way to maintain peace is for Washington to keep its role as a moderator between the two sides while preventing both from taking unilateral steps toward goals that would naturally provoke the other. US policy has to mirror the duality of the cross-strait arena by implementing dual balancing and <b>deterrent</b> <b>strategies.</b> It is also imperative that policymakers realize the complexity of the situation so as not to unwittingly provoke either side. This paper is an analysis of the emerging US strategy of deterring both sides of the Taiwan Strait from taking unilateral action while maintaining a balance of military and political forces, and gives some suggestions as to the further development of this strategy. ...|$|R

We show that if the costs of war are not overly high or low, then all equilibria must involve dove, hawk, and <b>deterrent</b> <b>strategies</b> and the probability of war is positive (but less than one) in any given period. Wars are between countries with differing armament levels and the frequency of wars is tempered by the presence of armament levels that are expressly chosen for their deterrent properties. As the probability of winning a war becomes more reactive to increased armament, the frequency of wars decreases. As it becomes increasingly possible to negotiate a credible settlement, the probability of peace increases, but the variance of armament levels increases and war becomes increasingly likely when negotiations break down.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe events of September 11, 2001, and the reactions that followed sparked {{a surge in}} international terrorist organizations, resulting in increased threat to U. S. national security. Although military operations have had some short-term successes against violent, extremist organizations (VEOs), they are an insufficient long-term counter-extremism strategy. It is apparent that a new approach and new way of analysis are necessary. We examine the problem by focusing on Al-Shabaab, a VEO in Somalia, with attention to its stages of development. Using unclassified sources, we apply three theoretical frameworks to determine whether deterrence might be effective as a countervailing strategy at each stage. For Phase One, beginning before the organization’s establishment, we look at historical and cultural context. Phase Two analyzes formation and growth {{from the perspective of}} social-movement theory, and Phase Three employs a structural perspective, using organizational-design theory, to the VEO in its mature form. Conclusions are drawn, based on deterrence theory, for each stage in the VEO’s evolution. This research provides a foundation by which policy and strategy makers may gain insight into the seams, gaps, strengths, and weakness of VEOs as they change over time, and where <b>deterrent</b> <b>strategies</b> may be applied to advantage.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the factors {{believed}} to affect   compliance behavior with regard to the zoning regulation of 284 Peninsular Malaysian fishermen. Frequent violation of regulations will have an impact on the demand for protection, and therefore lead to greater expenditure on law enforcement. The theoretical models of compliance behavior tested include the basic deterrent model, which focuses on the certainty and severity of penalty as a key determinant   of compliance, and models which integrate economic theory with theories of social psychology to account for legitimacy, deterrence and other motivations expected to influence an individuals’ decisions on whether to comply. Policy makers who want to improve compliance face two choices: the first choice is whether to focus only on building staff capacity to detect and correct non-compliance; and the second choice is a combination of the strategies in building staff capacity and at the same time building commitment among fishermen so that they will comply with the regulations.   The results of the empirical analysis provide evidence of the relationship between co-management strategies on the one hand, and types of fishermen on the other.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedDuring the Cold War, the United States constructed a nuclear triad, {{which consists of}} three components: strategic bombers, intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), and submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). The triad's mission was {{to ensure that the}} U. S. nuclear force would not be crippled or destroyed should an enemy attempt a first strike attack against the United States. This in turn offered a credible threat of a U.

Although some in the Air Force, along with various government personnel and those outside of the National Capital Region, have questioned the continued reliance on the bomber, there has been insufficient debate about either the bomber's deterrence value or second-strike launch capability in the event that nuclear deterrence collapses. This research examines the historic and contemporary reasons for maintaining bombers as part of the Triad. This thesis concludes that the strategic bomber should be removed from the Triad and the financial savings be redistributed to the remaining legs of the newly formed nuclear dyad.

Despite global diplomatic efforts and sanctions, it took South Africa 21 years to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). During this period, global opposition to its apartheid policies resulted in embargoes and sanctions, which served as catalysts for the country becoming a recognised nuclear proliferator and sanctions buster. Driven by domestic and regional threat perceptions, South Africa produced six nuclear devices as a <b>deterrent</b> <b>strategy.</b> It was only by 1987 that South Africa for the first time indicated its intention to accede to the NPT. Therefore, this contribution describes South Africa's position on and involvement in the multilateral negotiations leading to the NPT's agreed text, and South Africa's perspective on the nascent non-proliferation agreement. In order to achieve this, the contribution is chronologically limited to the period 1959 until 1991.

40|$|The Consequence Delivery System (CDS) is a {{suite of}} border and {{immigration}} enforcement programs designed to increase the penalties associated with unauthorized migration in order to convince people not to return (Rosenblum 2013). Despite its inauguration in 2011, {{many aspects of the}} CDS are not new. CDS does however, mark a shift from the <b>deterrent</b> <b>strategy</b> that, in the 1990 s that relied heavily on the dangers of the natural terrain to dissuade unauthorized border crossers, to one that actively punishes, incarcerates, and criminalizes them. This article presents findings from the Migrant Border Crossing Study, a random sample survey of 1, 100 recently deported migrants in six cities in Mexico conducted between 2009 and 2012. It examines the demographics and family ties of deportees, their experiences with immigration enforcement practices and programs under the CDS, and how these programs have reshaped contemporary migration and deportation along the US-Mexico border. The article covers programs such as criminal prosecutions of illegal entries under Operation Streamline, and the Alien Transfer and Exit Program (ATEP) or lateral repatriation program which returns immigrants to different locations from where they illegally entered. In relationship to these programs, it considers issues of due process and treatment of deportees in US custody. It also examines interior enforcement under Secure Communities, which, during the study period, comprised part of the overarching border security plan, and screened virtually everybody arrested in the United States against immigration databases. The article concludes that these programs do not have a strong deterrent effect. Instead, immigration enforcement has led to a “caging effect” {{over the past two decades}} which has disrupted seasonal migration flows, increased familial and social ties to the United States, and decreased the probability of returning to Mexico once in the United States. The development of strong family and other ties to the United States contributes to a greater resolve to return post-deportation.  </p...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – Barriers {{to entry}} and entry <b>deterrent</b> <b>strategies</b> are widely {{discussed}} {{elements of the}} strategic literature and help define the attractiveness of an industry. The channel structure of the pharmaceutical industry, {{in part because of}} the level of regulation applicable to it, has the potential for idiosyncratic strategic behaviour. The purpose of this paper is to explore the applicability of traditional approaches to entry barriers and entry deterrence in the Australian retail pharmacy industry facing the threat of a major entry by examining the perceptions of incumbent retail pharmacists regarding the strength of potential barriers to entry into the industry, and their likely response to entry. Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses both qualitative and quantitative methodology to categorise potential barriers to entry in terms of their perception by incumbent players. More than 20 in-depth interviews are conducted with a range of stakeholders and 132 retail pharmacists completed questionnaires. Findings – The paper suggests that this industry is relying on barriers which, while arguably effective, are outside the industry's control, and do not justify the apparent complacency among retail pharmacists. Practical implications – This research is of significant managerial relevance since it demonstrates that the incumbents are unprepared for potentially devastating impacts if supermarkets or other new competitors were to enter the market. Originality/value – The authors propose and utilise a novel framework for entry barrier analysis which includes the perceived locus of control for each entry barrier. The contribution of the paper is therefore in its treatment of the traditional arena of entry barriers and deterrence. 15 page(s...|$|R

Compliance with simpler specification standards, however, can be attained just as well with easier to administer <b>deterrent</b> enforcement <b>strategies</b> based on frequent inspections and adequate sanctions. ...|$|R
30|$|The project “War Consequences and War Prevention” of the Max Planck Institute {{attained}} {{particular political}} significance. It {{had already been}} begun {{under the aegis of}} von Weizsäcker in the research department of the “Association of German Academics (Vereinigung Deutscher Wissenschaftler)”, supported by the Volkswagen Foundation. This project examined in various scenarios the effects of a nuclear war on West German territory [2 Afheldt]. A task force designed a computer-assisted simulation model that divided the territory of West Germany into zones and forecast in war scenarios potential human losses, health casualties and housing and industrial costs. Furthermore, the group dealt with the <b>deterrent</b> <b>strategy</b> and developed scenarios for ranges of variations of strike likelihoods of new weapons, such as anti-ballistic missiles. The simulations showed that in none of the scenarios did the Federal Republic possess a real defensive potential, i.e. the capacity to prevent an opponent from carrying out his threat by use of military means. Ultimately, the group drew up three global qualitative scenarios: a duopoly as the most obvious option would suffer from the difficulty of maintaining the balance between the two powers. A monopoly as the second scenario was barely conceivable without a large-scale war. The third option was a global political system consolidated by international organisations that would initiate disarmament [103 von Weizsäcker; 3 Afheldt]. This option had already been designed by von Weizsäcker in 1963 entitled “Weltinnenpolitik” [100 von Weizsäcker, p 131]. Thus, the project confirmed von Weizsäcker’s thesis, that technical developments made a permanent stabilisation of the deterrent system almost impossible. From an epistemological point of view, the project had admittedly been designed {{in such a way that}} a confirmation of von Weizsäcker’s theses was not very surprising. Fundamentally, however, the project successfully connected peace research and futures research, and it had both a normative and an action-orientated reference point. As it questioned the deterrent system and called for promoting détente, the study backed the architects of the new eastern policy (Neue Ostpolitik), the new Chancellor Willy Brandt and State Secretary Egon Bahr, with whom von Weizsäcker stood in contact. 13 However, this project led von Weizsäcker and the Max Planck Institute further into the realm of peace (and not futures) research [see 46 Hutchinson & Inayatullah].|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of HistoryMark P. ParilloThe Distant Early Warning (DEW) Line, a key program under President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s “New Look” policy, {{prepared}} the United States defense posture for “the long haul” in the Cold War. Eisenhower wanted {{to prevent the}} escalation of military costs while still providing an adequate defense. Eisenhower emphasized a retaliatory capability and improved continental defenses, the so-called “sword and shield,” which are key features of the New Look. The DEW Line {{would prove to be}} a vital component of both. Whereas the initial emphasis of the DEW Line was to warn against attack providing for both active and passive defense measures, soon there was a definite “counter-offensive” role for the DEW Line as well—the protection of the primary retaliatory capability of the United States: the Strategic Air Command (SAC). The place of the DEW Line {{in the history of the}} Cold War has been an under appreciated topic. With the exception of the scholarship from the 1950 s and early 1960 s, only recently have continental defense and particularly the DEW Line been removed from the shadows of other Cold War events, strategies, and military programs. This doctoral thesis is an account of the DEW Line’s conception, implementation, and position in Eisenhower’s New Look and <b>deterrent</b> <b>strategy.</b> The DEW Line proved to be a cardinal feature of Eisenhower’s New Look strategy: it strengthened overall U. S. defenses and defense posture as the one element of U. S. defense policy (“New Look”) that improved and connected both the active and passive measures of continental defense by providing early warning against manned bombers flying over the polar region; it bolstered the deterrent value of SAC; and it was instrumental in developing closer peacetime military cooperation between the United States and Canada. In fact, U. S. - Canadian diplomacy during the 1950 s offers an important case study in “superpowermiddle power” interaction. However, despite the asymmetry in their relationship, U. S. - Canadian defense policies proved to be analogous. All of these objectives could not have been accomplished without the technological and logistical abilities necessary to construct successfully the DEW Line...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMyelin is {{critical}} in maintaining electrical impulse conduction in the central nervous system. The oligodendrocyte is the cell type responsible for myelin production within this compartment. The mutual supply of trophic support between oligodendrocytes and the underlying axons may indicate why demyelinated axons undergo degeneration more readily; the latter contributes to the neural decline in multiple sclerosis (MS). Myelin repair, termed remyelination, occurs in acute inflammatory lesions in MS and is associated with functional recovery and clinical remittances. Animal models have demonstrated that remyelination is mediated by oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) which have responded to chemotactic cues, migrated into the lesion, proliferated, differentiated into mature oligodendrocytes, and ensheathed demyelinated axons. The limited remyelination observed in more chronic MS lesions may reflect intrinsic properties of neural cells or extrinsic <b>deterrents.</b> Therapeutic <b>strategies</b> currently under development include transplantation of exogenous OPCs and promoting remyelination by endogenous OPCs.

40|$|Social norms {{regarding}} the copying, distribution, {{and use of}} expressive works (copynorms) are essential to understanding how copyright law affects society. By mitigating how stringently copyright owners and users actually enforce and observe copyright law, copynorms - whether those of librarians or file sharers - moderate, extend, and undermine the effect of copyright law. Yet, scholarship and public policy debates all too often overlook this phenomenon. This paper addresses this gap in the literature. After reviewing the legal scholarship and social science literature on how social norms interact with law, the paper examines several examples of copynorms that significantly alter the effect of copyright law. First, the norms of some communities consciously seek to mitigate or combat the effects of copyright law: the norm entrepreneurship of Creative Commons; writer's norms in favor of limited quotation with attribution; the norms of the open source and free software community; the norms of librarians; the norms of hackers; and the norms of warez traders. Next, there are copynorms that arise from collective behavior more than conscious design: the acceptance of search engine indexing and archiving; e-mail replying and forwarding norms; blogger norms; and consumer home recording. Last, the paper examines the role of social norms in the greatest of copyright's current social dilemmas - file sharing - and concludes that copynorms are essential to understanding and resolving this challenge. Based on analysis of research {{regarding the}} relative effectiveness of normative <b>strategies</b> and <b>deterrent</b> <b>strategies</b> for securing compliance with law, the paper concludes with suggestions for how copynorms might be influenced to foster greater support for copyright law. For example, the entertainment industry needs to support highly visible, legal alternatives to file sharing, while aggressively portraying compliance as the norm rather than the exception. Allowing {{people to believe that}} file sharing is the norm is disastrous to efforts to foster pro-compliance norms. Consumers' perceptions of fairness of business practices are also important, because norms are influenced by reciprocity. Finally, copyright owners may need to rely increasingly on core communities of avid fans, encouraging them to assist with the distribution and marketing of their work, enforcement of rights, and promotion of pro-compliance norms...|$|R
40|$|Birds {{are a major}} pest in {{vineyards}} both in New Zealand and overseas. There is a {{need for}} new behavioural research on birds' foraging habits and feeding preferences in vineyards, as much of the literature to date is anecdotal. Research on cues to birds' feeding will provide a basis on which new <b>deterrent</b> and control <b>strategies</b> can be devised. Spatial-and temporal bird damage in a small vineyard block was mapped to find if damage was correlated with grape maturity and environmental factors. Vineyard and field observations of bird behaviour using video technology combined with preference experiments aimed to establish the relative roles of grape sugar concentration and colour in avian selection. Proximity of vineyards to bird roosts affects damage levels, regardless of differing maturity between locations. The rate of damage tends to increase exponentially once grape maturity has passed a threshold of 13 °Brix. Bunches positioned closest to the ground receive more damage if blackbirds or song thrushes are the predominant pests. Both sugar concentration and grape colour were found to affect birds' feeding preference, but the importance of the two factors varied between years. Black and green grape varieties were differentially preferred by blackbirds (Turdus merula) and song thrushes (Turdus philomelos) while silvereyes (Zosterops lateralis) appeared to have no strong colour preference. It was apparent that there were other, not assessed, grape factors that also affect selection. In small unprotected vineyards that are adjacent to bird roosts the entire grape crop can be taken by bird pests. Besides removing the roosts, which can be beneficial shelterbelts in regions exposed to high winds, growers currently may have no alternative other than to use exclusion netting to keep crops intact. The differential preferences between bird species for variety characteristics suggest that any new <b>deterrents</b> and other <b>strategies</b> to deflect birds from grape crops may need to be species-specific...|$|R
