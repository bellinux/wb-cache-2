5|$|Avoidance therapy {{consists}} of minimizing or eliminating triggers. For example, <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> {{are sensitive to}} light, using a small television, avoiding video games, or wearing dark glasses may be useful. Operant-based biofeedback based on the EEG waves has some support <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> {{do not respond to}} medications. Psychological methods should not, however, be used to replace medications. Some dogs, commonly referred to as seizure dogs, may help during or after a seizure. It is not clear if dogs have the ability to predict seizures before they occur.|$|E

40|$|Few {{researchers}} have devoted {{attention to the}} role of self-directedness in maintaining employability. This study examines the relationship between self-directedness in learning and in career and employability of low-qualified employees, We report the results of a one year follow-up study of 284 low-qualified employees. The results show that the highest chance for a vertical job change is found <b>in</b> <b>those</b> employees <b>who</b> show higher levels of self-directedness in learning and <b>in</b> <b>those</b> employees <b>who</b> show higher levels of self-directedness in their career. The chance of having no turnover intention and no future turnover behavior is found <b>in</b> <b>those</b> employees <b>who</b> show higher levels of self-directedness in their learning and <b>in</b> <b>those</b> employees <b>who</b> show lower levels of self-directedness in their career. No relationship was found between self-directedness and job tenure...|$|R
5|$|Contraceptive sponges {{combine a}} barrier with a spermicide. Like diaphragms, they are {{inserted}} vaginally before intercourse {{and must be}} placed over the cervix to be effective. Typical failure rates {{during the first year}} depend on whether or not a woman has previously given birth, being 24% <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> have and 12% <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> have not. The sponge can be inserted up to 24hours before intercourse and must be left in place for at least six hours afterward. Allergic reactions and more severe adverse effects such as toxic shock syndrome have been reported.|$|E
5|$|In larger case series, the {{mortality}} was 1.6% overall. In {{the group of}} patients who were unwell enough to require surgery, {{the mortality}} was 1.9%, with no deaths <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> could be treated conservatively.|$|E
5|$|Programs {{encouraging}} sexual abstinence do {{not appear}} to affect subsequent HIV risk. Evidence of any benefit from peer education is equally poor. Comprehensive sexual education provided at school may decrease high risk behavior. A substantial minority of young people continues to engage in high-risk practices despite knowing about HIV/AIDS, underestimating their own risk of becoming infected with HIV. Voluntary counseling and testing people for HIV does not affect risky behavior <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> test negative but does increase condom use <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> test positive. It is not known whether treating other sexually transmitted infections is effective in preventing HIV.|$|E

5|$|After {{the initial}} episode, 2% may {{experience}} a further episode {{within the first}} month. After this, there is a 1% annual risk of recurrence. Those {{with high blood pressure}} and dissections in multiple arteries may have a higher risk of recurrence.

5|$|If {{pneumothorax}} {{occurs in}} a smoker, this is considered an opportunity to emphasize the markedly increased risk of recurrence <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> continue to smoke, and the many benefits of smoking cessation. It may be advisable for someone to remain off work {{for up to a}} week after a spontaneous pneumothorax. If the person normally performs heavy manual labor, several weeks may be required.

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> {{have had}} stones, {{prevention}} is by drinking fluids such {{that more than}} two liters of urine are produced per day. If this is not effective enough, thiazide diuretic, citrate, or allopurinol may be taken. It is recommended that soft drinks containing phosphoric acid (typically colas) be avoided.|$|E

5|$|Most {{cases of}} COPD can be {{prevented}} by reducing exposure to risk factors. This includes decreasing rates of smoking and improving indoor and outdoor air quality. While treatment can slow worsening, there is no cure. COPD treatments include stopping smoking, vaccinations, respiratory rehabilitation, and often inhaled bronchodilators and steroids. Some people may benefit from long-term oxygen therapy or lung transplantation. <b>In</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> have periods of acute worsening, increased use of medications and hospitalization may be needed.|$|E
5|$|Myxedema coma {{is a rare}} but {{life-threatening}} {{state of}} extreme hypothyroidism. It may occur <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> {{are known to have}} hypothyroidism when they develop another illness, but it can be the first presentation of hypothyroidism. The illness is characterized by very low body temperature without shivering, confusion, a slow heart rate and reduced breathing effort. There may be physical signs suggestive of hypothyroidism, such as skin changes or enlargement of the tongue.|$|E
5|$|Optic nerve sheath {{fenestration}} is {{an operation}} that involves the making of an incision in the connective tissue lining of the optic nerve in its portion behind the eye. It is not entirely clear how it protects the eye from the raised pressure, {{but it may be}} the result of either diversion of the CSF into the orbit or the creation of an area of scar tissue that lowers the pressure. The effects on the intracranial pressure itself are more modest. Moreover, the procedure may lead to significant complications, including blindness in 1‚Äì2%. The procedure is therefore recommended mainly <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> have limited headache symptoms but significant papilledema or threatened vision, or <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> have undergone unsuccessful treatment with a shunt or have a contraindication for shunt surgery.|$|E
