According to Berdella, {{although}} Sheldon was responsible in paying rent, he considered him [...] "an inconvenience" [...] and, although he was not physically attracted to this victim, chose to drug and hold him captive on April 12 {{when he returned home}} from work to find Sheldon intoxicated in his home. Berdella was adamant he held no firm malice toward Sheldon, but saw him as an individual upon whom he could [...] "express some of the anger and frustration that I had toward other people on". Sheldon was drugged with sedatives and held captive in the second floor bedroom for three days, enduring forms of torture such as the swabbing of drain cleaner in his left eye, the insertion of needles beneath his fingertips, the binding of his wrists with piano wire with the intention of permanently damaging the nerves in his hands, and filling his ears with caulking to reduce his <b>hearing</b> <b>capacity.</b>|$|E

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{highlighted}} {{the diversity of}} fish inner ear morphology. However, {{the function of the}} shape, size and orientation of the different structures remains poorly understood. The saccule (otolithic endorgan) is considered to be the principal hearing organ in fishes and it has been hypothesized that sagitta (saccular otolith) shape and size affect hearing capacities: large sagittae are thought to increase sensitivity. The sagittae of many ophidiids and carapids occupy a large volume inside the neurocranium. Hence they are a good structure with which to test the size hypothesis. The main aim {{of this study was to}} investigate <b>hearing</b> <b>capacities</b> and inner ear morphology in two ophidiiform species: Ophidion rochei and Carapus acus. We used a multidisciplinary approach that combines dissections, µCT-scan examinations and auditory evoked potential techniques. Carapus acus and O. rochei sagittae have similar maximal diameters; both species have larger otoliths than many non-ophidiiform species, especially compared with the intra-neurocranium volume. Both species are sensitive to sounds up to 2100 Hz. Relative to the skull, O. rochei has smaller sagittae than the carapid, but better <b>hearing</b> <b>capacities</b> from 300 to 900 Hz and similar sensitivities at 150 Hz and from 1200 to 2100 Hz. Results show that <b>hearing</b> <b>capacities</b> of a fish species cannot be predicted only based on sagitta size. Larger otoliths (in size relative to the skull) may have evolved mainly for performing vestibular functions in fishes, especially those species that need to execute precise and complex movements...|$|R

40|$|Reptiles {{form the}} most diverse clade of living land vertebrates. They include lizards, snakes, crocodiles, birds, and turtles, {{as well as many}} fossil groups. In this chapter we revise the otic anatomy of early reptilians, {{including}} some aquatic groups and turtles. Basal members possessed a stout stapes that still retained its ancestral bracing function, and they lacked a tympanic membrane. The acquisition of tympanic hearing did not happen until later {{in the evolution of the}} clade and occurred independently in both parareptiles and diapsids. Parareptiles also show additional otic modifications that are convergent with much later reptilians, which are potentially related to the evolution of more terrestrial habits. In contrast, in aquatic reptiles, such as ichthyosaurs, thalattosaurs, and sauropterygians, the otic anatomy and <b>hearing</b> <b>capacities</b> are adapted to an aquatic medium, resulting in many convergences in their otic anatomy. In turtles, however, there are differences in the configuration and morphology among Triassic and modern taxa...|$|R

50|$|At {{least seven}} {{locations}} {{have been proposed}} for the sonic mechanism of Hamadryas butterflies. Non-destructive experimental methods and scanning electron microscopy suggest that both sexes emit sound and the sound apparatus, located in the forewing, is percussive, not stridulatory. At {{the end of the}} upward wing stroke, the wings are clapped and modified r-veins meet at a speed of approximately 1420 mm/s, producing the characteristic clicks. Wing beat frequency of free-flying individuals is 20-29 Hz. Clicks last a mean of 1.38 ms with mean intervals of 43.74 ms and the component frequencies concentrate around 2.4 kHz, matching Hamadryas <b>hearing</b> <b>capacity</b> and being appropriate for the acoustic conditions of habitat.|$|E
50|$|The {{technique}} {{is widely used}} in many modern classical works on bowing instruments. The extended technique involves bowing the instrument on the afterlength, the short length of string behind the bridge. The tone is very high and squeaky. By playing the instrument at a string part behind the bridge, the opposed part starts to resonate. The tone is louder at harmonic relations of the bridge string length. On violins the tone can be very high, even above our <b>hearing</b> <b>capacity.</b> Depending on the instrument, the pitch of the tones {{may or may not}} be perceived (cellos and double basses are more likely to produce recognizable pitches because of their longer strings). This {{technique is}} used extensively in Krzysztof Penderecki's Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima. Another example is found in Ferde Grofé’s Grand Canyon Suite where bowing behind the bridge in a violin cadenza represents a donkey’s braying.|$|E
40|$|Photothermal {{techniques}} offer a nice {{tool for}} the determination of changes in thermal parameters {{of different types of}} samples. Using a very thin pyroelectric transducer, a very simple and versatile ac calorimeter can be built. The described inverse pyroelectric technique allows high-resolution ac-calorimetric measurements of the temperature dependence of the specific heat capacity. Since measuring frequencies up to a few hertz can be used, which sire higher than in most alternative ac-calorimetric setups, noise can be reduced and measuring times shortened. With a small modification of the measurement cell, the determination of absolute specific <b>hear.</b> <b>capacity</b> and thermal conductivity values of liquid samples was achieved. Comparison of the frequency response of the system with and without a solid thermal load in the neighborhood of the sample yields data with an accuracy of about 5 % and 10 % for specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity, respectively. If necessary, absolute values of specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity can also be obtained by making contact between a (solid) thermal load and the liquid. A pure ac-calorimetric operation is then no longer possible, thus restricting this mode of operation to homogeneous or to properly aligned anisotropic liquids. (C) 1998 American Institute of Physics.

40|$|Like all otophysan fishes, serrasalmids (piranhas and relatives) {{possess a}} Weberian {{apparatus}} that improves their <b>hearing</b> <b>capacities.</b> We compared the hearing abilities among eight species of serrasalmids having different life-history traits: herbivorous vs. carnivorous and vocal vs. mute species. We also made 3 D reconstructions of the auditory system to detect potential morphological variations associated with hearing ability. The hearing structures {{were similar in}} overall shape and position. All the species hear in the same frequency range and only slight {{differences were found in}} hearing thresholds. The eight species have their range of best hearing in the lower frequencies (50 – 900 Hz). In vocal serrasalmids, the range of best hearing covers the frequency spectrum of their sounds. However, the broad overlap in hearing thresholds among species having different life-history traits (herbivorous vs. carnivorous and vocal vs. non-vocal species) suggests that hearing ability is likely not related to the capacity to emit acoustic signals or to the diet, i. e. the ability to detect sounds is not associated with a given kind of food. The inner ear appears to be highly conservative in this group suggesting that it is shaped by phylogenetic history or by other kinds of constraints such as predator avoidance. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHearing {{sensitivity}} is {{a fundamental}} determinant of a species’ vulnerability to anthropogenic noise, however {{little is known about}} the <b>hearing</b> <b>capacities</b> of most conservation dependent species. When audiometric data are integrated with other aspects of species’ acoustic ecology, life history, and characteristic habitat topography and soundscape, predictions can be made regarding probable vulnerability to the negative impacts of different types of anthropogenic noise. Here we used an adaptive psychoacoustic technique to measure hearing thresholds in the endangered giant panda; a species that uses acoustic communication to coordinate reproduction. Our results suggest that giant pandas have functional hearing into the ultrasonic range, with good sensitivity between 10. 0 and 16. 0 kHz, and best sensitivity measured at 12. 5 – 14. 0 kHz. We estimated the lower and upper limits of functional hearing as 0. 10 and 70. 0 kHz respectively. While these results suggest that panda hearing is similar to that of some other terrestrial carnivores, panda hearing thresholds above 14. 0 kHz were significantly lower (i. e., more sensitive) than those of the polar bear, the only other bear species for which data are available. We discuss the implications of this divergence, as well as the relationship between hearing sensitivity and the spectral parameters of panda vocalizations. We suggest that these data, placed in context, can be used towards the development of a sensory-based model of noise disturbance for the species...|$|R

40|$|In {{terms of}} {{disability}} and handicap, problems in auditory function involve {{much more than}} a reduced sensitivity to soft sounds, the most commonly used measure of hearing impairment. In daily life, many hearing-impaired (HI) listeners suffer more from impaired processing of audible sounds, than from missing inaudible sounds. For example, people can have difficulties understanding speech in noisy situations or localizing sounds. The degree of these types of disabilities does not only depend on hearing thresholds, but also on other aspects of the auditory system such as loudness recruitment and spectral and temporal resolutions as well as non-auditory factors, such as cognition. All these aspects in hearing are widely investigated in research settings using many different, often time-consuming tests, but there are very few applications in clinical audiology. In clinical audiology, pure-tone audiometry is traditionally used and sometimes supplemented with speech audiometry for functional diagnostics, hearing aid fitting and counselling. As a result, many hearing aid fittings are based on audiogram data only, although modern hearing aids have a large number of fitting parameters that should ideally be set based on individual <b>hearing</b> <b>capacities.</b> The present thesis focuses on clinically applicable tests that could complement the pure-tone audiogram for functional diagnostics. The clinical usability and relevance of these tests for speech perception or broader auditory function is investigated.

In Nd 2 Ni 3 Si 5, Gd 2 Ni 3 Si 5, and Dy 2 Ni 3 Si 5, magnetization studies indicated only one magnetic transition, whereas, hear-capacity data show two transitions. T-N of the heavier rare-earth member, Tb 2 Ni 3 Si 5, showing significant deviation from de Gennes scaling is notable. Magnetic entropy, Delta S, estimated from heat-capacity {{data suggest that}} the magnetic ground state is a doublet in R 2 Ni 3 Si 5 (R = Pr, Nd, Sm, Dy, Ho) and a quartet in Tb 2 Ni 3 Si 5.

40|$|International audienceThe {{remarkable}} <b>hearing</b> <b>capacities</b> {{of mammals}} arise from various evolutionary innovations. These include the cochlear outer hair cells and their singular feature, somatic electromotility, i. e., {{the ability of}} their cylindrical cell body to shorten and elongate upon cell depolarization and hyperpolarization, respectively. To {{shed light on the}} processes underlying the emergence of electromotility, we focused on the βV giant spectrin, a major component of the outer hair cells' cortical cytoskeleton. We identified strong signatures of adaptive evolution at multiple sites along the spectrin-βV amino acid sequence in the lineage leading to mammals, together with substantial differences in the subcellular location of this protein between the frog and the mouse inner ear hair cells. In frog hair cells, spectrin βV was invariably detected near the apical junctional complex and above the cuticular plate, a dense F-actin meshwork located underneath the apical plasma membrane. In the mouse, the protein had a broad punctate cytoplasmic distribution in the vestibular hair cells, whereas it was detected in the entire lateral wall of cochlear outer hair cells and had an intermediary distribution (both cytoplasmic and cortical, but restricted to the cell apical region) in cochlear inner hair cells. Our results support a scenario where the singular organization of the outer hair cells' cortical cytoskeleton may have emerged from molecular networks initially involved in membrane trafficking, which were present near the apical junctional complex in the hair cells of mammalian ancestors and would have subsequently expanded to the entire lateral wall in outer hair cells...|$|R
40|$|The study {{focussed}} on {{the effects}} of triclosan (TCS) exposure on mobility and <b>hearing</b> <b>capacities</b> of Cyprinodon variegatus larvae. TCS is an omnipresent antimicrobial and contaminant of aquatic ecosystems, which can act as endocrine disruptor, mainly by modifying thyroid functioning. Larval stages are particularly vulnerable to deleterious effects of endocrine disrupters because of potential impairment of fish development and behaviour. Exposure to TCS was conducted at fertilization of eggs at concentrations likely {{to be found in the}} environment: 20, 50 and 100 μg. l- 1. The analysis of growth parameters of C. variegatus showed no effect of TCS on the fertility of eggs, survival and larval weight. Subsequently, THs concentrations were measured on 15 days post hatching larvae. THs are initially produced as T 4 (thyroxine) cells and then converted in the bioactive form of T 3 (triiodothyronine) cells. The observed increase of T 4 and T 3 cells in larvae exposed to 50 and 100 μg. l- 1 suggests an increase in THs synthesis as a consequence of TCS exposure. Auditory thresholds of larvae were determined using ABR (Auditory Brainstem Response) technique, and finally larval mobility was measured. For both parameters no significant differences were observed among the three different treatments. Audiograms showed that the auditory system is not yet completely established at 30 days post hatching. However, these results allowed us to consider C. variegatus as an “hearing generalist” because this species have a hearing sensitivity lower than 2000 Hz. Regarding locomotion, our result summarized short time experiences targeting only swimming speed, distance and degree of mobility. It would be interesting to expand the behavioural aspects on other parameters of locomotion and integrate Cyprinodon reaction to different stress (light or touch). In conclusion, our results require an extensive long-term study on the full life cycle of C. variegatus, in order to evaluate the impact of triclosan on neural function and behaviour through several generations.

40|$|Exacerbation of {{cerebrospinal}} fluid (CSF) inflammation {{in response to}} bacteriolysis by beta-lactam antibiotics contributes to brain damage and neurological sequelae in bacterial meningitis. Daptomycin, a nonlytic antibiotic acting on Gram-positive bacteria, lessens inflammation and brain injury compared to ceftriaxone. With a view to a clinical application for pediatric bacterial meningitis, we investigated the effect of combining daptomycin or rifampin with ceftriaxone in an infant rat pneumococcal meningitis model. Eleven-day-old Wistar rats with pneumococcal meningitis were randomized to treatment starting at 18 h after infection with (i) ceftriaxone (100 mg/kg of body weight, subcutaneously [s. c. ], twice a day [b. i. d. ]), (ii) daptomycin (10 mg/kg, s. c., daily) followed 15 min later by ceftriaxone, or (iii) rifampin (20 mg/kg, intraperitoneally [i. p. ], b. i. d.) followed 15 min later by ceftriaxone. CSF was sampled at 6 and 22 h after the initiation of therapy and was assessed for concentrations of defined chemokines and cytokines. Brain damage was quantified by histomorphometry at 40 h after infection and hearing loss was assessed at 3 weeks after infection. Daptomycin plus ceftriaxone versus ceftriaxone significantly (P < 0. 04) lowered CSF concentrations of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP- 1), MIP- 1 α, and interleukin 6 (IL- 6) at 6 h and MIP- 1 α, IL- 6, and IL- 10 at 22 h after initiation of therapy, led to significantly (P < 0. 01) less apoptosis, and significantly (P < 0. 01) improved <b>hearing</b> <b>capacity.</b> While rifampin plus ceftriaxone versus ceftriaxone also led to lower CSF inflammation (P < 0. 02 for IL- 6 at 6 h), it had no significant effect on apoptosis and <b>hearing</b> <b>capacity.</b> Adjuvant daptomycin could therefore offer added benefits {{for the treatment of}} pediatric pneumococcal meningitis...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: In this study, {{procedures}} for measuring sound localization, sound lateralization, and binaural masking level differences (BMLDs) {{in young children}} were developed. Sensitivity for these tasks was assessed in large groups of children between 4 and 9 yr of age to investigate potential developmental trends. Design: Sound localization was measured in the sound field, with a broadband bell-ring presented from one of nine loudspeakers positioned in the frontal horizontal field. A group of 33 children between 4 and 6 yr of age and 5 adults took part in this experiment. Sound lateralization based on interaural time differences was measured with headphones in 49 children between 4 and 9 yr of age and 10 adults. A low-frequency stimulus containing harmonics 2 to 5 from a click train with a rate of 160 Hz was used. In the 8 MLD test, the same filtered click train was presented diotically or dichotically (phase reversed or time delayed) in a broadband (200 to 1000 Hz) frozen noise to 23 children between 4 and 6 yr of age and 10 adults. For comparison with literature, additional measurements with a 500 -Hz sinusoid were administered to adults. All tasks were adapted to the interest and attention span of young children. Results: Children of 5 yr of age did not perform significantly different from adults on the sound localization task, but mean absolute errors were larger for the 4 -yr-olds. Also on the BMLD task, 5 -yr-old children performed at the adult level, whereas the 4 -yr-old children obtained significantly less binaural unmasking compared with the adults. Concerning sound lateralization, a small but significant difference between adults and children existed, but no age effects were apparent in the 4 -to 9 -yr-old group.

Participants were divided into 4 groups, non smokers and Smokers in noisy area between 70 - 90 d B & nonsmokers and smokers Living in quiet area, 45 - 55 dB,Smoking was associated with hearing loss at 8 ooo Hz., in both bivariate and multivariate analysis. An additive interaction at high frequencies mostly at 8000 Hz between smoking and noise appeared after age 40 years. At age 21 - 39 years old,neither smoking nor environmental noise had a significant adverse effect on <b>hearing</b> <b>capacity</b> at low frequencie...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} in analysis {{and design of}} shell type foundations {{have led to the}} understanding that there are more advantages of shell type foundations compared to their conventional flat counterparts. The hearing capacities of conical and pyramidal shell foundations on dry sand were determined in the present paper by conducting laboratory model tests. The results were compared with those of circular and square flat foundations, respectively. Four foundation models on dry sand were tested in which influence of the shell configuration on the <b>hearing</b> <b>capacity</b> and settlement were investigated. The present experimental study indicated admirable performance of shell type foundations with respect to ultimate and settlement characteristics. Also characteristic of deformations or the failure mechanism of both shell and its flat counterparts were simultaneously investigated by using coloured and non-coloured sand layer by layer in dry sand model...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to assess the effect of Eicosapentaenoic-Docosahexaenoic Acids (EPA/DHA) and Choline Bitartrate-Inositol (CHO/INO) supplementation on ADHD-children by {{evaluating}} their MRS profiles. Basal Ganglia’s MRS was performed {{at the beginning of}} the study and after 6 -month EPA/DHA and CHO/INO treatment using a 1. 5 Tesla Magnetic Resonance System. The results show a significant increase in the signal intensities of Choline-containing compounds and a significant raise in Choline/Creatine ratio after 6 -month-therapy on ADHD-children, which correlate with the improvement of their capacities and abilities. The link between MRS-based EPA/DHA and CHO/INO monitoring and the improvement of the numerical, verbal, visual, <b>hearing</b> and concentration <b>capacities</b> may also provide a fertile ground for developing an EPA/DHA plus CHO/INO based supplementation therapy and predicting its efficacy to upgrade ADHD-children’s cognitive abilities...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: {{estimation}} of functional loss incidence and identification {{of risk factors}} associated with new disability onset in people aged 75 and older without severe dependence in a rural primary care setting. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Prospective cohort study of {{a representative sample of}} people aged 75 years or older without severe dependence (Barthel Index> 20 and Lawton Index> 1) at a primary care center, with a 12 -month follow-up. The baseline geriatric assessment recorded activities of daily living (ADL), sociodemographic information, numbers of drugs prescribed, previous hospital admissions and falls, cognitive function, <b>hearing</b> and visual <b>capacity,</b> body mass index, blood pressure, and the Short Physical Performance Battery to evaluate lower limb function. ADL was re-assessed after 12 months, defining functional loss as a fall of ≥ 10 points on the Barthel Index and/or ≥ 2 instrumental activities of the Lawton Index. Bivariate and multivariate analyses using logistic regression models were conducted to identify factors independently associated with functional loss. RESULTS: Mean age was 81. 7 years, 58. 7 % of patients were men, and 23. 4 % presented functional loss at the 12 -month follow-up. Variables identified as independent predictors of functional loss were hospital admissions (aOR 3. 92; 95 %CI: 1. 35 - 11. 39), cognitive impairment (aOR 2. 60; 95 %CI: 1. 39 - 4. 92) and lower limbs functional limitation (aOR 2. 01; 95 %CI: 1. 02 - 3. 97). CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the use of performance batteries in primary care for identifying elderly persons at risk of functional decline; and they also highlight the relevance of appropriate management of hospital admissions and planned discharges in order to preserve patients' functional status.

40|$|Sound waves pervade {{the entire}} {{universe}} and as humans our <b>hearing</b> <b>capacity</b> permits us to detect only a limited set of waves. Machines, however don’t have this limitation. Imagine a machine that can sense {{a knock on the}} door, someone breaking into your home, detect accidents by itself and take decisions by sensing different sounds in the environ- ment! Our project, Never Ending Learning of Sound aims to make the machine continuously learn sounds that exist, by crawling the entire web. This will help the machine to under- stand, sense, categorize and model the relationships between different sounds. It is an effort to build one of the largest struc- tured sound database. This is a difficult problem due to three aspects. 1. Amount of Data needed to be processed for sound 2. Interference of Sounds 3.
