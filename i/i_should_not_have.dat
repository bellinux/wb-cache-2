But to {{wish you}} a good morning, in the pretty blue and white room where I had the {{pleasure}} to sit and read with you The Hermit, a poem which is such a favourite with me that I have read it twice this summer. Oh! What a blessing to keep good company! Very likely <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been acquainted with either poet or poem was it not for you.|$|E

During the winter of 1883, whilst her husband was in Ceylon, she worked on a series of memoirs of her childhood home, with a view to publishing them under the title An Emigrant's Notebook, but this plan was abandoned. She wrote a series of pamphlets in 1887 called Over the River, in which she appealed for funds for the parish of St. Stephens in Southwark, south London. She also wrote a number of short stories in the years 1890 and 1891, although these also never appeared in print. A number of unpublished poems from this period have also survived. When Sir William Gregory died in March 1892, Lady Gregory went into mourning and returned to Coole Park; there she edited her husband's autobiography, which she published in 1894. She was to write later, [...] "If I had not married <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> learned the quick enrichment of sentences that one gets in conversation; had I not been widowed <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> found the detachment of mind, the leisure for observation necessary to give insight into character, to express and interpret it. Loneliness made me rich—'full', as Bacon says." ...|$|E
500|$|McGee fought Nick Ring in {{a rematch}} at [...] McGee lost via a close {{unanimous}} decision. For {{the second time}} in a bout against Ring, the loss was regarded as controversial by many media sources. Stats after the fight showed that McGee outstruck Ring 32-25 in the second round and 53-16 in the final round. After the fight, McGee said [...] "I felt like I had cage control, was more aggressive, out-struck him and attempted a submission in the third round. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> left it {{in the hands of the}} judges and finished the fight." ...|$|E

500|$|Vulović {{told reporters}} {{that she did not}} think of her fall every day, but {{admitted}} to struggling with survivor's guilt. [...] "Whenever I think of the accident, I have a prevailing, grave feeling of guilt for surviving it and I cry... Then I think maybe <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> survived at all." [...] Vulović declined therapy to help her cope with her experiences and instead turned to religion, becoming a devout Orthodox Christian. She stated that her ordeal had turned her into an optimist. [...] "If you can survive what I survived," [...] she said, [...] "you can survive anything." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{a thanksgiving}} service for a {{victory at the}} Battle of Oudenarde, Anne did not wear the jewels that Sarah had {{selected}} for her. At the door of St Paul's Cathedral, they had an argument that culminated in Sarah offending the Queen by telling her to be quiet. Anne was dismayed. When Sarah forwarded an unrelated letter from her husband to Anne, with a covering note continuing the argument, Anne wrote back pointedly, [...] "After the commands you gave me on the thanksgiving day of not answering you, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> troubled you with these lines, but to return the Duke of Marlborough's letter safe into your hands, and {{for the same reason}} do not say anything to that, nor to yours which enclosed it." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 1890, {{during the}} run of The Gondoliers, however, Gilbert {{challenged}} Carte over the expenses of the production. Among other items to which Gilbert objected, Carte had charged {{the cost of a}} new carpet for the Savoy Theatre lobby to the partnership. Gilbert believed that this was a maintenance expense that should be charged to Carte alone. Gilbert confronted Carte, who refused to reconsider the accounts. Gilbert stormed out and wrote to Sullivan that [...] "I left him with the remark that {{it was a mistake to}} kick down the ladder by which he had risen". Helen Carte wrote that Gilbert had addressed Carte [...] "in a way that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> thought you would have used to an offending menial."

500|$|On 22 April 1890, {{during the}} run of The Gondoliers, Gilbert {{discovered}} that maintenance expenses for the theatre, including a new £500 carpet for the front lobby of the theatre, were being charged to the partnership instead of borne by Carte.

[...] Gilbert {{wrote in a letter to}} Sullivan that [...] "I left him with the remark that it was a mistake to kick down the ladder by which he had risen". [...] Helen Carte wrote that Gilbert had addressed Carte [...] "in a way that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> thought you would have used to an offending menial."

500|$|Territorial {{representative}} David Levy {{proposed a}} resolution that was passed in Congress in 1842: [...] "that the Secretary of War be directed to place before this House such information as can be obtained {{in relation to the}} practicability and probable expense of draining the everglades of Florida." [...] From this directive Secretary of the Treasury Robert J. Walker requested Thomas Buckingham Smith from St. Augustine to consult those with experience in the Everglades on the feasibility of draining them, saying that he had been told two or three canals to the Gulf of Mexico would be sufficient. Smith asked officers who had served in the Seminole Wars to respond, and many favored the idea, promoting the land as a future agricultural asset to the South. A few disagreed, such as Captain John Sprague, who wrote he [...] "never supposed the country would excite an inquiry, other than as a hiding place for Indians, and had {{it occurred to me that}} so great an undertaking, one so utterly impracticable, as draining the Ever Glades was to be discussed, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> destroyed the scratch of pen upon a subject so fruitful, and which cannot be understood but by those who have waded the water belly deep and examined carefully the western coast by land and by water." ...|$|E

2500|$|The CPUSA was {{singled out}} for special {{criticism}} at the 11th Enlarged Plenum of ECCI in March 1931, with Osip Piatnitsky mocking the slogans used by the American Party, declaring of the slogan [...] "Work or Wages" [...] that [...] "if I were unemployed and in America, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> understood this slogan." [...] It similarly expressed disdain for the slogan [...] "Don't Starve — Fight!" [...] as ineffective.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the same}} way he refused to use his {{surgical}} skill or food manufacturing business for personal financial gain, Dr. Kellogg did not make concerted efforts to profit from his medical inventions. Kellogg's statement in 1916 about his food company sheds light on his general motivations: [...] "I desire to make clear … that the food business I have been carrying on is a part of my general scheme to propagate the ideas of health and biological living. Otherwise, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> engaged in it as a commercial enterprise, but I have carried it on {{as a part of the}} general philanthropic work in which I was engaged." ...|$|E

Both Citigroup and ACC Capital Holdings have substantial holdings in Massachusetts. Patrick attempted to deflect criticism, claiming he was calling not as governor but as a private citizen.

2500|$|During {{the years}} as CIGS, Brooke had a stormy {{relationship}} with Winston Churchill. Brooke was often frustrated with the Prime Minister's habits and working methods, his abuse of generals and constant meddling in strategic matters. At the same time Brooke greatly admired Churchill {{for the way he}} inspired the Allied cause and for the way he bore the heavy burden of war leadership. In one typical passage in Brooke's war diaries Churchill is described as a [...] "genius mixed with an astonishing lack of vision – he is quite the most difficult man to work with that I have ever struck but <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> missed the chance of working with him for anything on earth!" ...|$|E

[...] These claims were later disproven by the University and the players in question, including Patrick Patterson, who graduated in three years, and John Wall, who finished the semester in question with a 3.5 GPA.

2500|$|Furtwängler, {{although}} {{he had decided to}} remain in Germany, was certainly no Nazi [...] He had a private telephone line to me which was not connected via the exchange [...] Before going to bed, he used to chat with me over telephone. Sometimes I told him amusing stories to cheer him up, sometimes we talked about politics. One of the main threats the Nazis used against Furtwängler and myself later on was the assertion that they had recorded all these conversations. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> thought that it was possible! Was there enough shellac? If the Nazis really did this, their ears must certainly have burnt, and it was not surprising that Furtwängler was eventually put on their black list, let alone myself.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1995, Boehner {{distributed}} {{campaign contributions}} from tobacco industry lobbyists on the House floor as House members were weighing how to vote on tobacco subsidies. In a 1996 documentary by PBS called The People and the Power Game, Boehner said [...] "They asked me to give out a half dozen checks quickly before {{we got to the}} end of the month and I complied. And I did it on the House floor, which I regret. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> done.

A special constable said: [...] "It was not difficult to understand the strikers' attitude toward us. After a few days I found my sympathy with them rather than with the employers. For one thing, I had never realized the appalling poverty which existed. If I had been aware of all the facts, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> joined up as a special constable". It was decided that Fascists {{would not be allowed to}} enlist in the OMS without first giving up their political beliefs, as {{the government}} feared a right-wing backlash so the fascists formed the so-called [...] "Q Division" [...] under Rotha Lintorn-Orman to combat the strikers.|$|E
