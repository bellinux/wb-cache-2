40|$|The {{thermoluminescence}} (TL) glow {{curves of}} UVirradiated PAAm-PVA polyblend have been studied. The experimental glow curves show {{the presence of}} two peaks with glow peak temperatures at 373 K and 479 K. The values of activation energy and frequency factors are determined by employing computer simulation. Most of the TL glow curves obey non first order kinetics. The results obtained by using TL experimental technique are correlated with the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results. The increase in crystalline component with increase in PVA component in the blend has been confirmed by noting the formation of spherulites around an <b>indenter</b> <b>mark</b> on the blend, employing Optical microscopy...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties and deformation behaviors of copper with different grain sizes {{have been investigated}} in this study by instrumented nanoindentation. Following the Hall-Petch relation, the hardness of copper specimens increased as the grain size decreased. Dislocations were clearly observed in deformed regions around <b>indent</b> <b>marks,</b> indicating plastic deformation by dislocation formation and sliding. However, the hardness of electroless copper films with an ultrafine grain size of only 10 nm dropped. Voiding at grain boundaries and triple grain junctions was observed {{as a consequence of}} grain-boundary sliding and grain rotation, which was expected as the dominant deformation mechanism resulting in the reduced hardness. The critical shear stresses for the initiation of plastic deformation in the copper specimens with large grain sizes were close to the theoretical value and comparatively much lower for electroless copper films with an ultrafine grain size.

40|$|A quenchable superhard {{high-pressure}} carbon {{phase was}} synthesized by cold compression of carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes {{were placed in}} a diamond anvil cell, and x-ray diffraction measurements were conducted to pressures of ≈ 100 GPa. A hexagonal carbon phase was formed at ≈ 75 GPa and preserved at room conditions. X-ray and transmission electron microscopy electron diffraction, as well as Raman spectroscopy at ambient conditions, explicitly indicate that this phase is a sp 3 -rich hexagonal carbon polymorph, rather than hexagonal diamond. The cell parameters were refined to a 0 = 2. 496 (4) Å, c 0 = 4. 123 (8) Å, and V 0 = 22. 24 (7) Å 3. There is a significant ratio of defects in this nonhomogeneous sample that contains regions with different stacking faults. In addition to the possibly existing amorphous carbon, an average density {{was estimated to be}} 3. 6 ± 0. 2 g/cm 3, which is at least compatible to that of diamond (3. 52 g/cm 3). The bulk modulus was determined to be 447 GPa at fixed K′≡ 4, slightly greater than the reported value for diamond of ≈ 440 – 442 GPa. An <b>indented</b> <b>mark,</b> along with radial cracks on the diamond anvils, demonstrates that this hexagonal carbon is a superhard material, at least comparable in hardness to cubic diamond...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose was}} to {{evaluate}} the effect of various Opalescence tooth-whitening products on enamel. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Enamel blocks were exposed to Opalescence PF 10 % Carbamide Peroxide (n = 10), Opalescence PF 20 % Carbamide Peroxide (n = 10), Opalescence Trèswhite Supreme 10 % Hydrogen Peroxide (n = 10) and Opalescence Quick PF 45 % Carbamide Peroxide (n = 10) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The control group was enamel blocks (n = 10) kept in artificial saliva. The values were obtained before exposure and after the 14 -days treatment period. Enamel blocks were kept in saliva between treatments. <b>Indent</b> <b>marks</b> on enamel blocks were examined using the scanning electron microscope for treatment effects. RESULTS: All four different Opalescence products damaged enamel. The most damage was done when treated {{for a long period}} (112 hours). SEM images also showed damage to enamel by all 4 products. Opalescence with 10 % and with 20 % Carbamide Peroxide showed the highest damage, which also differed significantly (p < 0. 05) from the saliva control group (p < 0. 05; Tukey-Kramer Multiple comparison test). CONCLUSION: All 4 Opalescence products damaged enamel. Higher damage was done by the 10 % carbamide peroxide and 20 % carbamide peroxide products because of the much longer exposure period (112 hours in comparison to 7 hours).

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose was}} to {{evaluate}} the effect of various tooth-whitening products on the South African market, containing carbamide peroxide (CP) or hydrogen peroxide (HP), on enamel microhardness. Methods: Enamel blocks were exposed to: Nite White® ACP 10 % CP (group 2, n= 10); Yotuel® Patient 10 % CP (group 3, n= 10); Opalescence® PF 10 % CP (group 4, n= 10); Opalescence® PF 20 % CP (group 5, n= 10); Opalescence® Treswhite Supreme 10 % HP (group 6, n= 10); Yotuel® 10 Minutes 30 % CP (group 7, n= 10); Opalescence® Quick 45 % CP (group 8, n= 10), Yotuel® Special 35 % HP (group 9, n= 10), Opalescence® Boost 38 % HP (group 10, n= 10) according to the instructions of the manufacturers. The control group (1) was enamel blocks (n= 10) kept in artificial saliva at 37 ˚C without any treatment. The microhardness values were obtained before exposure and after a 14 -day treatment period. Specimens were kept in artificial saliva at 37 ˚C between treatments. Data were analysed using Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer Multiple Comparison Test. <b>Indent</b> <b>marks</b> on the enamel blocks were also examined under the scanning electron microscope. Results: All whitening products decreased enamel microhardness except group 10. Only Groups 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 showed significant decrease in enamel microhardness {{as compared to the}} control group (p< 0. 05). Groups 2, 3 and 7 differed significantly from all the other groups (p< 0. 05). The highest damage was recorded for group 2 (Nite White® ACP 10 % CP), which differed significantly from groups 3 and 7. SEM images also showed damage to enamel. Conclusions: All products damaged enamel except Opalescence® Boost 38 % HP. In general, the products containing carbamide peroxide were more damaging while longer treatment periods influenced the microhardness values negatively. Nite White® ACP without fluoride showed relatively more damage than all the other products containing fluoride. Department of HE and Training approved lis...|$|R
30|$|Figure  5 (a 1 to a 4, and b 1 to b 4) shows {{a typical}} {{material}} deformation process of pristine single-crystal copper during nanoindentation {{with a series}} of structure evolutions for nucleation of initial defect beneath the indenter. In the undeformed state, none of defects are distributed or generated beneath the indenter. With small deformation, a few vacancies generate just beneath the <b>indenter,</b> which <b>marks</b> the beginning of nucleation of dislocations. As the single-crystal copper atoms experience the displacive structure transition, the well-known dislocation embryos are gradually developed from the sites of homogeneous nucleation as shown in the prospective close-up view of Figure  5 (b 4). In addition, the atomic glides on the surface are also clearly marked with black arrows, which are parallel with the slip vectors associated with the FCC (111) surface. The motivation of these glides indicates the displacive plastic deformation around the indenter as shown in Figure  5 (b 4).|$|R

40|$|Cut mark {{analysis}} {{to date has}} been intermittently and superficially researched {{across a range of}} disciplines, despite its potential to significantly contribute to criminal investigation. The current study aims to elucidate cut mark analysis by proposing a novel classification system for the identification of knife cuts (kerfs) in bone. The system was devised, to record accurate and reliable information about cut marks and the criteria were tested for association with the knives that created them. Optical Microscopy was used to examine knife cuts on fleshed porcine bone. Incised cuts were made by a range of serrated, scalloped and fine-edged blades (n= 9), by the author, and participants (n= 23) were recruited to make marks on bone under the same force-measured conditions, using the Kistler force plate and a bespoke frame to control the level of height to which the knife can be raised above the bone prior to impact. Resultant kerfs were created by a single operator (n= 86) and created by a range of individuals (n= 186). The data suggests that consistent force was not achieved and the resultant marks on the bones made by the same knife had wide variation in their appearance and depth. The classification criteria tested did not provide discrete identification of knife blades from the assessment of kerf features; however, trends were identified from criteria including margin regularity, margin definition, floor width and wall gradient, which may form the basis for further investigation. Marks made by a single operator showed more significant associations (p< 0. 05) than group operators, and although kerfs from each share some trends, several significant relationships observed in marks made by a single operator are not shared by the participant group. Limitations of using optical microscopy included the inability to view all aspects of each mark, particularly when combined with variation in depth and angle produced by human operators. From the present results, it is suggested that the use of digital microscopy with a superior ability to build three dimensional images of <b>indented</b> <b>marks</b> would provide the necessary step forward to improve discrimination between knife classifications, based on the areas highlighted by the current research. This reinforces the need for further understanding of the mechanics of cut mark application in human individuals and their potential effects on kerf features...|$|R

40|$|My work is {{the product}} of two chief motivations: a desire to touch and a {{compulsion}} to create. Beyond any external inspiration lie these two gut-level responses. The obsessive character of these drives is reflected through an extravagant covering of surface with minute, repetitive markings. The result is intensely focused, highly articulated work that combines passion, beauty, and diverse content. The very nature of the surfaces [...] pushed, poked, scored, <b>marked,</b> <b>indented,</b> smoothed, carved, wiped, and sanded [...] are taken to extremes. As the maker, I am both captivated and at ease; it is just me and the clay. The act of texturing becomes a fetish. This attention to surface remains a constant. The overall effect, significantly, is not one of chaos. Through arranging, layering, and division of space, I create an intense order that includes a variety of visual and tactile sensations. Reduced scale, meticulous finish, and a sense of time create feelings of intimacy and preciousness; touching becomes sensuous and personal. Smooth, raised areas contrast with excessively marked spaces to provide additional imagery, increase tactile stimulation, and, formally, to provide rest for the eye. Silent areas become eloquent in such a context. Finally, layered planes of texture are built up to imply an evolution within the piece [...] a history. More than formal aspects, my work explores a variety of ideas. The 2 ̆ 2 beautification 2 ̆ 2 of common household appliances promotes dialog concerning the art vs. craft debate; can a decorated, functional object serve as art, or vice versa? Other, less representational objects, often refer to an enigmatic ritual or ceremony through their intriguing nature and apparent lack of presentation qualities (no top, no bottom, etc.). Through the use of ornamental handles and certain twists in form, I give figurative objects character. This, in turn, suggests narrative and invites humor and playfulness. Also, issues of scale, quantity, and presentation are investigated using piles or reliquaries as display options. One thing that keeps all of my art cohesive as a body is the notion of fantasy. The forms, surfaces, and imagery I use come almost entirely from my imagination and/or subconscious. Herein lies a link with Surrealism. Though the work may resemble forms found in nature, I am more interested in using my intuition to create fiction. In the end, each piece is to be as engaging and seductive to the viewer as the process is to me...|$|R
