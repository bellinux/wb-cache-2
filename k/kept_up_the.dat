5|$|After 1978, {{a number}} of astronomers <b>kept</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> search for Lowell's PlanetX, {{convinced}} that, because Pluto {{was no longer a}} viable candidate, an unseen tenth planet must have been perturbing the outer planets.|$|E
5|$|The ensuing {{confusion}} allowed Belvidera to fire her stern chasers, killing {{six more}} men aboard President. Rodgers <b>kept</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> pursuit, using his bow chasers to severely damage Belvideras rigging, but his two broadsides had little effect. The crew of Belvidera quickly made repairs to the rigging. They cut loose her anchors and boats and pumped drinking water overboard to lighten her load, thereby increasing her speed. Belvidera soon gained enough speed to distance herself from President, and Rodgers abandoned the pursuit. Belvidera sailed to Halifax {{to deliver the}} news that war had been declared.|$|E

5|$|After {{the hostage}} {{exchange}} is agreed, Troilus suggests elopement, but Cressida argues {{that he should}} not abandon Troy and that she should protect her honour. Instead, she promises to meet him within ten days. Troilus spends much of the intervening time on the city walls, sighing in the direction where Cressida has gone. No horses or sleeves, as used by Guido or Benoît, are involved in Troilus' learning of Cressida's change of heart. Instead a dream hints at what has happened, and then the truth is confirmed when a brooch – previously a gift from Troilus to Cressida – is found on Diomedes' looted clothing. In the mean time, Cressida has <b>kept</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> pretence in their correspondence that she still loves Troilus. After Cressida's betrayal is confirmed, Troilus becomes ever fiercer in battle.|$|E
5|$|Al-Muktafi also <b>kept</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{perennial}} {{conflict with}} the Byzantine Empire, with varying success. In May 902, al-Qasim ibn Sima al-Farghani was appointed {{in command of the}} frontier districts of the Jazira. In 902 or 903, a naval raid reached the island of Lemnos, dangerously close to the Byzantine capital, Constantinople; the island was plundered and its inhabitants carried off into slavery. Nevertheless, in May 903, the newly appointed governor of Tarsus, Abu'l-Asha'ir Ahmad ibn Nasr, was dispatched to the frontier districts with gifts for the Byzantine ruler, Leo VI the Wise (r. 886–912), and in return, Byzantine envoys arrived in Baghdad for negotiations on a prisoner exchange. The exchange eventually took place in September–October 905, at the river Lamus in Cilicia, but was interrupted because the Byzantines reneged on the agreed terms. After further negotiations, the exchange was completed in August 908.|$|E
5|$|Beresford was {{alerted to}} the French advance by reports {{received}} on 12 May from Spanish patriots in Seville, who had sent word of Soult's departure. Beresford <b>kept</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> pretence of besieging Badajoz by sending an unsuccessful demand for {{surrender to the}} French commander {{on the afternoon of}} that same day, but he realized he would now not have time to finish the job, so he ordered the withdrawal of his siege guns and supplies. On 13 May, the Spanish cavalry attached to Colborne's brigade came into contact with the French force and, in accordance with orders given by Wellington in April, they fell back while sending word of Soult's new position to Beresford. Later that day Long's British cavalry also encountered the advancing French and hastily pulled back—although Long, too, was following Wellington's orders not to engage, Beresford considered his withdrawal somewhat premature and thought Long could have delayed the French by forcing them to deploy.|$|E

5|$|Following {{this the}} unit became {{involved}} in largely defensive operations as the 1st Special Service Brigade dug in. Nevertheless they <b>kept</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> pressure on the Germans by carrying out offensive patrols, small scale raids and sniping. In mid-July a breakout from the beachhead was attempted and the 1st Special Service Brigade moved through the Le Bois de Bavent, a large wooded area, as the Germans began to withdraw. No. 3 Commando {{was involved in this}} advance, moving to Varaville where they caught up with the German rearguard and proceeded to clear the village. The advance continued into the following month and on 19 August they were ordered to seize the high ground to the north of Dozule. Attacking at night, the brigade advanced with No. 3 Commando leading the main body behind the vanguard and was able to infiltrate the German positions before the lead sections ran into the German headquarters units.|$|E
5|$|He {{also sought}} to build ties with {{continental}} churches. Cenwald was a royal priest before his appointment as Bishop of Worcester, and in 929 he accompanied two of Æthelstan's half-sisters to the Saxon court so that the future Holy Roman Emperor, Otto, could choose one of them as his wife. Cenwald went on to make a tour of German monasteries, giving lavish gifts on Æthelstan's behalf and receiving in return promises that the monks would pray for the king and others close to him in perpetuity. England and Saxony became closer after the marriage alliance, and German names start to appear in English documents, while Cenwald <b>kept</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> contacts he had made by subsequent correspondence, helping the transmission of continental ideas about reformed monasticism to England.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United drew {{their first}} and only home blank of the season against Newcastle United, but made amends with a 3–2 victory over bottom team Blackburn Rovers. Defensive frailties, most notably from Schmeichel, were on show away to Sheffield Wednesday as the team missed {{the chance to go}} top of the table. A brace from winger Jens Niclas Alexandersson and a debut goal scored by Wim Jonk {{consigned}} Ferguson to his second defeat in the league and extended a barren run at Hillsborough; United had won only a single game in their last eight visits. On 29 November, Manchester United hosted Leeds United and a valiant performance by the visitors looked to have gained them a draw, after going two goals down in the first half. A moment of brilliance from Butt however secured the three points for the Red Devils and <b>kept</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> pressure on the challengers.|$|E

5|$|By 17 June, Allied planes began {{operating}} from Labuan airfield and the 2/43rd Battalion was transferred across Brunei Bay to the mainland, landing at Menumbok and Mempakul, after an amphibious reconnaissance, {{along with the}} 2/11th Commando Squadron. Two companies and the battalion headquarters landed at Mempakul on 19 June, and the 2/43rd subsequently advanced up the Klias River, using barges and landing craft, while the 2/32nd Battalion advanced along the Padas River. By late June, the two battalions converged on Beaufort, linking up {{to the west of}} Kandu, and between 26 and 29 June 1945, the town was the scene of heavy fighting during which the 2/43rd lost 13 men killed and 30 wounded. The 2/43rd was tasked with taking the high ground {{to the north of the}} town around the Woodford Estate and Mount Lawley, and carrying out a flanking attack to the east. For his actions in destroying four Japanese machine-gun positions, Private Tom Starcevich was awarded the Victoria Cross. After the capture of Beaufort, the fighting continued in the area as the 2/28th Battalion <b>kept</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> pressure on the withdrawing Japanese; for the 2/43rd, though, Beaufort proved to be the last significant action of the war, as hostilities ended in mid-August, following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The battalion's final campaign of the war cost it 56 casualties, including those killed or wounded on Labuan.|$|E
5|$|Having {{successfully}} {{prevented the}} US 1st Marine Division from reinforcing the Imjin River front, the Chinese 40th Army turned its attention towards the 27th Brigade on 23 April. The battle started {{during the night}} of 23/24 April, and continued until late the following day as an entire Chinese division—the 118th Division, totalling perhaps 10,000 men {{under the command of}} Deng Yue—engaged the two forward battalions of 27th Brigade. The initial Chinese attack at Kapyong engaged 3 RAR on Hill 504, while {{in the early part of}} the battle the Middlesex and New Zealand gunners were all but cut off. However, the resistance of the Australians ultimately allowed them to safely withdraw and the Middlesex then moved into a reserve position astride the western bank of the river in order to provide depth to the brigade defence. The two battalions of the Chinese 354th Regiment launched repeated attacks on the two forward Australian companies on the northwest spur of Hill 504. Assault after assault of massed Chinese troops <b>kept</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> attack throughout the night, but the strong defence of the Australians on the brigade's right flank held them back, before they turned their attention to the Canadians the following day.|$|E
5|$|In May the {{battalion}} was {{withdrawn from the}} front line for re-organisation and training. It did not return until the Third Battle of Ypres in September and October 1917, when they were committed to the fighting first at Menin Road. The 7th Battalion had 57 men killed in this phase, and then later at Broodseinde another 98 were killed. Following these battles, the 7th Battalion was withdrawn from the front line once more in December. In March 1918, however, following {{the start of the}} German Spring Offensive, {{the battalion}} was called back to help stem the tide of the German advance. As the German offensive ran out of momentum, the battalion <b>kept</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> pressure on the German line through a series of peaceful penetrations, before subsequently taking part in the Allied Hundred Days Offensive, which was launched near Amiens on 8 August 1918. As a part of this offensive, the battalion fought major actions at Lihons on 9–11 August where they captured a number of German mortars and Herleville Woods on 23 August. They continued operations until late September 1918 when they were withdrawn with a strength of just 410 men and it was out of the line when the armistice came into effect in November. Shortly afterwards the demobilisation process began and as the battalion's numbers fell as men were repatriated back to Australia, it was amalgamated with 6th Battalion. This battalion was amalgamated with another, formed from the 5th and 8th Battalions, to form the 2nd Brigade Battalion.|$|E
