In the past few years the state of Texas, under the direction of <b>Governor</b> George W. <b>Bush,</b> has seriously considered the idea of cutting property taxes. Since schools are financed mainly through property taxes in Texas, this is an extremely important and volatile issue. I chose to conduct my research on this particular topic. In my project, I looked at the history and fairness of the property tax in Texas, and alternative solutions to this state's impending school finance crisis. To accomplish these tasks, I sent out questionnaires to 500 Texas residents, researched other states, and came up with two possible solutions. This thesis will show that <b>Governor</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>was</b> right to pursue property tax relief, however, his methods for achieving an equitable and beneficial solution for Texas residents were flawed. Instead, the state of Texas should either implement a state income tax or use educational vouchers in place of the current property tax system...|$|R
