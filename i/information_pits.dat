40|$|We propose {{theoretical}} {{consideration and}} computer modeling of information pit recording and etching processes in chalcogenide vitreous semiconductors. We demonstrate how to record and develop <b>information</b> <b>pits</b> {{with the necessary}} shape and sizes in chalcogenide photoresists using gaussian laser beam and selective etching. It {{has been shown that}} phototransformed region cross-section could be almost trapezoidal or parabolic depending on the photoresist material optical absorption, recording beam power, exposure, etchant selectivity and etching time. After illumination, the spatial distribution of photo-transformed material fraction was calculated using the Kolmogorov-Awrami equation. Analyzing obtained results, we derived a rather simple approximate analytical expression for the dependence of the photo-transformed region width and depth on the recording gaussian beam power, radius and exposure time. Then the selective etching process was simulated numerically. The obtained results quantitatively describes the characteristics of pits recorded by the gaussian laser beam in thin layers of As 40 S 60 chalcogenide semiconductor.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} the redistributive effects of the personal income tax (<b>PIT).</b> <b>Information</b> on the <b>PIT</b> reported in the household survey substantially understates the real tax liability borne by households. The redistributive effects of the personal income tax would be undervalued if the information was used. In order to correct the underestimation of the PIT by non-reporting in our dataset, we apply the tax schedule and impute the tax liability for the individuals in our sample according to the components of their earned income. This imputed tax liability is used to calculate the MT index, the most commonly used measure of the redistributive effects of taxes and governmental subsidies, and to decompose the MT index into the effects of horizontal equity and vertical equity. The MT index and its decomposition show that the personal income tax does reduce inequality, but the effect is small and negligible. The low average personal income tax rate is the main reason why it fails to contribute more to improving inequality. グローバルCOEプログラム = Global COE Progra...|$|R

40|$|The {{electrical}} properties of several tens of metres of lateritic weathering mantle were investigated by using electrical resistivity tomography "ERT" in two basement areas of eastern Senegal. The field {{survey was conducted}} along two profiles providing continuous coverage. Colour-modulated pseudosections of apparent resistivity vs. pseudo-depth were plotted for all survey lines, giving an approximate image of the subsurface structure. In the area underlain by granitic basement, the pseudosection suggests a very inhomogeneous weathered layer in which the apparent resistivity changes more rapidly than thickness. In the second area, underlain by schists, the lateral changes in {{electrical properties}} are less pronounced {{than those of the}} granitic area. Interpretation of 2 D Wenner resistivity data yielded considerable detail about the regolith, even without <b>pit</b> <b>information.</b> In both areas, the near-surface topsoil comprising undersaturated lateritic material is highly resistive.

40|$|Abstract. Tooth pitting in gears {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{critical}} fault modes in gearboxes, and monitoring the increase of tooth pitting damage can avoid great risk to gearboxes. The optimal selection of monitoring parameters in gearboxes can reduce the monitoring cost and improve the reliability on the basis of meeting monitoring requirements. To better track the increase of pitting damage, monitoring parameters should include abundant <b>information</b> of <b>pitting</b> growth in its evolution process. Hence, this paper proposes a novel approach to select optimal monitoring parameters based on fault trend analysis of pitting growth. With the analytical formulations of tooth pitting, the dependencies between damage levels of tooth pitting and the reduction of mesh stiffness can be obtained, then the damage dynamics of the gearbox system due to tooth pitting can be built. Afterwards, the dynamic responses of generalized parameters in the models of pitting levels can be simulated, and their condition indicators can be obtained by using effective signal processing methods. Then, the sensitivities of each generalized parameter to tooth damage can be calculated, and the optimal monitoring parameters can be determined according to the size of sensitivities. The simulation results show that monitoring the acceleration of gear and calculating its kurtosis can effectively track tooth pitting growth...|$|R

40|$|Ductile iron pipes {{have been}} used in North America since the late 1950 s. This paper {{describes}} research that endeavored to gain a thorough understanding of the geometry of external corrosion pits and the factors (e. g., soil properties, appurtenances, and service connections) that influence this geometry. This understanding is subsequently used in the companion paper to devise a sampling scheme and to infer the condition of ductile iron buried water mains. Soil corrosivity is not a directly measurable parameter, and pipe external corrosion is primarily a random phenomenon. The literature is replete with methods and systems that attempt to use soil properties (e. g., resistivity, pH, and redox potential) to quantify soil corrosivity and subsequently predict pipe corrosion. In this research, varying lengths of ductile iron pipes were exhumed by several North American water utilities. The exhumed pipes were cut into short sections, sandblasted, and tagged. Soil samples were also obtained at discrete locations along the exhumed pipe. Pipe sections were scanned for external corrosion using a specially developed laser scanner. Scanned corrosion data were processed using specially developed software to obtain <b>information</b> on <b>pit</b> depth, pit area, and pit volume. Statistical analyses were subsequently performed on these three geometrical attributes. Various soil characteristics were investigated to determine their impact on the geometric properties of the corrosion pits. Subsequently, a method is proposed to assess the condition of a ductile iron pipe, based on the geometry of corrosion pits of several samples extracted along the pipe. This paper describes the pipe exhumation, data preparation, and statistical analysis of corrosion pits.
