50|$|After {{graduating from}} college, Smith {{and his two}} friends, Jim Kammerud and Marty Fuller, started an {{animation}} studio called Character Builders Inc. Their first paid job was producing a 60-second animated opening for the TV series Super Safari with Jack Hanna. Other jobs followed for clients such as White Castle, sequences in films that the studio was given when other studios fell behind, and a claymation project that they were given following the rise in popularity of The California Raisins. Initial budgets were restrictive for the studio, which required the animators to be resourceful {{in order to meet}} their deadlines. Smith sometimes did the voice work as well as the animation on certain projects, and the animators sometimes had family members come in on some evenings to paint animation cells. Though Smith found the projects exciting, he realized that it was not the type of cartooning he wanted to do, which was complicated by periods in which the studio had no work. It was during one of these slow periods that Smith reconsidered his career.

40|$|The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ku complex, while {{important}} for nonhomologous DNA end joining, {{is also necessary}} for maintaining wild-type telomere length and a normal chromosomal DNA <b>end</b> <b>structure.</b> Yeast cells lacking Ku can grow at 23 °C but are {{unable to do so}} at elevated temperatures due to an activation of DNA damage checkpoints. To gain insights into the mechanisms affected by temperature in such strains, we isolated and characterized a new allele of the YKU 70 gene, yku 70 - 30 ts. By several criteria, the Yku 70 - 30 p protein is functional at 23 °C and nonfunctional at 37 °C. The analyses of telomeric repeat maintenance as well as the terminal DNA <b>end</b> <b>structure</b> in strains harboring this allele alone or in strains with a combination of other mutations affecting telomere maintenance show that the altered DNA <b>end</b> <b>structure</b> in yeast cells lacking Ku is not generated in a telomerase-dependent fashion. Moreover, the single-stranded G-rich DNA on such telomeres is not detected by DNA damage checkpoints to arrest cell growth, provided that there are sufficient double-stranded telomeric repeats present. The results also demonstrate that mutations in genes negatively affecting G-strand synthesis (e. g., RIF 1) or C-strand synthesis (e. g., the DNA polymerase α gene) allow for the maintenance of longer telomeric repeat tracts in cells lacking Ku. Finally, extending telomeric repeat tracts in such cells at least temporarily suppresses checkpoint activation and growth defects at higher temperatures. Thus, we hypothesize that an aspect of the coordinated synthesis of double-stranded telomeric repeats is sensitive to elevated temperatures...|$|E

40|$|Fibroblast {{growth factor}} 2 (FGF 2) -initiated FGF {{receptor}} (FGFR) -signaling requires {{the assistance of}} heparin/heparan sulfate. Here, we evaluated the effects of different heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) -expressing cell lines and HSPGs derived from these cells on FGF 2 -induced FGFR 1 -phosphorylation in heparan sulfate-negative BaF 3 cells. HSPGs supplied in membrane-associated form, by presenting cells, were all effective promotors of FGF 2 -initiated FGFR 1 phosphorylation, independently of their nature (syndecan/glypican) or cellular origin (human lung fibroblasts, transfected Namalwa cells, or transfected K 562 cells). A treatment with heparitinase initially stimulated, but finally completely inhibited, the activity of these presenting cells. In comparison, equivalent amounts of soluble HSPGs, obtained by trypsinization of these cells or by immunopurification from cell extracts, did not promote FGF 2 -induced FGFR 1 -phosphorylation, yet removal of the less anionic species or a further treatment with heparitinase converted these soluble fractions into potent activators of FGF 2 /FGFR 1 signaling. Extrapolating from current structural models, we suggest that FGFR dimerization and autophosphorylation is supported by cooperative "heparin-like end structures," and that cell surface association and concentration compensate for the relative scarcity of such <b>end</b> <b>structures</b> in native HSPGs. In this model, "proteolytic" shedding of heparan sulfate would act as a diluting, down-regulatory mechanism, while "heparanolytic" shedding might act as an up-regulatory mechanism, by increasing the concentration of these <b>end</b> <b>structures.</b> status: publishe...|$|R
