Some of the key events, such as the induction of erythroid 2, 3 -bisphosphoglycerate (2, 3 -BPG), carbonic anhydrase (CAII), and pyrimidine 5 '-nucleotidase (P 5 N) synthesis are oxygen dependent (Baumann R, Haller EA, Schöning U, and Weber M, Dev Biol 116 : 548 - 551, 1986; <b>Dragon</b> <b>S</b> and Baumann R, Am J Physiol Regulatory Integrative Comp Physiol 280 : R 870 -R 878, 2001; <b>Dragon</b> <b>S,</b> Carey C, Martin K, and Baumann R, J Exp Biol 202 : 2787 - 2795, 1999; <b>Dragon</b> <b>S,</b> Glombitza S, Götz R, and Baumann R, Am J Physiol Regulatory Integrative Comp Physiol 271 : R 982 -R 989, 1996; <b>Dragon</b> <b>S,</b> Hille R, Götz R, and Baumann R, Blood 91 : 3052 - 3058, 1998; Million D, Zillner P, and Baumann R, Am J Physiol Regulatory Integrative Comp Physiol 261 : R 1188 -R 1196, 1991) in an indirect way: hypoxia stimulates the release of norepinephrine (NE) /adenosine into the circulation (Dragon et al., J Exp Biol 202 : 2787 - 2795, 1999; Dragon et al., Am J Physiol Regulatory Integrative Comp Physiol 271 : R 982 -R 989, 1996). This leads via erythroid beta-adrenergic/adenosine A(2) receptor activation to a cAMP signal inducing several proteins in a transcription-dependent manner (Dragon et al., Am J Physiol Regulatory Integrative Comp Physiol 271 : R 982 -R 989, 1996; Dragon et al., Blood 91 : 3052 - 3058, 1998; Glombitza <b>S,</b> <b>Dragon</b> <b>S,</b> Berghammer M, Pannermayr M, and Baumann R, Am J Physiol Regulatory Integrative Comp Physiol 271 : R 973 -R 981, 1996). To understand how the cAMP-dependent processes are initiated, we screened an erythroid cDNA library for cAMP-regulated genes. We detected three genes that were strongly upregulated (> 5 -fold) by cAMP in definitive and primitive red blood cells. They are homologous to the mammalian Tob, Ifr 1, and Fos proteins. In addition, the genes are induced in the intact embryo during short-term hypoxia. Because the genes are regulators of proliferation and differentiation in other cell types, we suggest that cAMP might promote general differentiating processes in erythroid cells, thereby allowing adaptive modulation of the latest steps of erythroid differentiation during developmental hypoxia...|$|R

40|$|A better {{understanding}} of the factors influencing tooth eruption is important given the association between altered eruption patterns and crowded or decayed teeth. Hence, the aims of this study were to quantify the extent of asymmetry in tooth eruption and to determine whether eruption asymmetry was significantly influenced by sex, tooth position or timing of emergence. Additionally, directionality of asymmetry and variation between ethnic groups were also explored. Data collection was based on the examination of serial dental casts from a sample of 90 Aborigines (50 male, 40 female) aged 6 to 18 years from the Yuendumu settlement in the Northern Territory of Australia. These casts were obtained at yearly intervals from the 1950 s to the early 1970 <b>s.</b> <b>Tooth</b> antimeres on each cast were compared using a 4 -grade eruption score.

Grant number 2002 - 33 of the Ohio University Research Council (GSS); De Beers Africa ExplorationPotholes carved into streambeds can be important components of channel incision, {{but they have}} received little quantitative attention. Here empirical evidence is presented from three sites along the Orange River, Republic of South Africa that demonstrates that the pothole dimensions of radius and depth are strongly correlated using a simple power law. Where radius is the dependent variable, the exponent of the power law describes {{the rate of increase}} in radius with increasing depth. Erosion within potholes is complexly related to erosion on the adjacent bed. Erosion efficiencies within small, hemispherical potholes must be high if the potholes are to survive in the face of bed translation (incision). As potholes deepen, however, the necessary efficiencies decline rapidly. Increasing concavity associated with growth imposes stricter constraints; comparatively deep potholes must erode orders of magnitude larger volumes of substrate than shallower potholes in the face of bed retreat. Hemispherical potholes are eventually converted to cylindrical potholes, the geometries of which favor enlargement while they are small. Geometric models constructed using the power law show unambiguously that more substrate is eroded by volume from cylindrical pothole walls during growth than from cylindrical pothole floors. Grinders thus play a secondary role to suspended sediment entrained within the vortices that occur in potholes. Continued growth leads to coalescence with other potholes or destruction through block detachment depending on local geology. The combination of geology and erosion mechanisms may determine whether a strath or inner channel develops {{as a consequence of the}} process. Peer reviewe...|$|R

The majority {{of children in the}} U. S. experience dental caries in their primary teeth by age eight. This problem could be addressed by primary care providers applying fluoride varnish (FV) to children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>teeth</b> starting at the age of primary tooth eruption. The causes of dental caries in children’s primary teeth are multifactorial and therefore require multiple interventions.

40|$|In this work, we have {{investigated}} three different research problems. In the first chapter, we introduce an imaging colorimeter for measuring tooth color {{that is based}} on two exposures with a digital camera using two different filters. We describe new procedures for alignment and calibration of the system. We also consider three different sources of illumination. We propose two approaches to estimating tooth color information from the acquired camera data, both of which employ linear regression. In the first approach, we estimate CIE XYZ coordinates of the tooth under a pre-selected illuminant. In the second approach, we estimate the spectral reflectance of the tooth, thus enabling us to predict tristimulus values under any illuminant. Finally, we present results from in vivo measurement of subject 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>teeth.</b> ^ In the second chapter, a subspace matching method is developed to design color filters for a multi-spectral imaging system to capture the spectral reflectance of surfaces accurately with minimal number of measurements.

The reach {{can be divided into}} three geomorphological zones: Zone 1 (0 ? 11 km), a muddy proximal part with a single meandering channel (w/d < 10) and near-permanent standing water in oxbows and backswamps; Zone 2 (11 ? 17. 5 km), a transitional mud-to-sand part with one main channel (w/d not, vert, similar 20 ? 30), a number of sinuous palaeochannels and oxbows, and only limited standing water; and Zone 3 (17. 5 ? 28 km), a sandy distal part with a single meandering channel (w/d not, vert, similar 15 ? 30), scroll bars and oxbows, and little standing water. Each zone also has a distinctive sedimentology: Zone 1 is characterised by an not, vert, similar 3 ? 4 m thick succession of basal sand and minor granules overlain by dominantly muddy sediment deposited primarily by oblique accretion in meander bends; Zone 2 is characterised by < 4 m of interbedded sand and mud deposited primarily by lateral point-bar accretion, although a history of avulsions also attests to the importance of abandoned-channel accretion; and Zone 3 is characterised by < 3 m of dominantly sand deposited primarily by lateral point-bar accretion. This unusual downstream sediment coarsening trend, and the associated changes in channel and floodplain character, are independent of sediment inputs from tributaries, and result from a downstream increase in bankfull unit stream power from < 3. 5 W m? 2 (Zone 1) to not, vert, similar 4 ? 10 W m? 2 (Zone 3). Mud is deposited primarily in low-energy Zone 1 but is conveyed in suspension more effectively through higher energy Zones 2 and 3, only forming drapes over sandy lateral accretion deposits during waning flood stages. The downstream increase in unit stream power is controlled in part by a slight downstream increase in floodplain gradient that may be related to a subtle variation in the erosional resistance of the bedrock underlying the channel bed. These findings add to previous work on meandering rivers by demonstrating that mud-dominated meanders can occur in long-term erosional settings where the channel bed is grounded on bedrock, and that downstream fining trends may be reversed locally.

50|$|Suminia getmanovi was an anomodont, {{a species}} of synapsid (stem mammal), that lived 260 million {{years ago in the}} late Permian ("zone II"). This anomodont was {{discovered}} in Kotelnich on the Vyatka River Russia. It is found in sandstone sediment, so most likely represents a delta-dwelling species, but this is not conclusive, as the specimen may have been washed down river, away from its habitat. <b>S.</b> getmanovi has <b>teeth</b> that are heavily abraded, suggesting plant material of high silica content. More recently found fossils indicate that it led an arboreal lifestyle.|$|R
