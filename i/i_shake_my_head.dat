[...] He has also claimed that [...] "We said that we wouldn't place a camera anywhere {{it would be impossible to}} get one. We would say [...] "Imagine it was a news story, or a sports event, cameramen would put cameras where they could in a hurry, and get any shot they could." [...] This is what we wanted [...] to feel like, as if people were filming glimpses at any chance they could." [...] He also found himself [...] "Doing things [...] think are cliche; panning up just as a roar happens, or getting the perfect shot, things <b>I</b> <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> at when watching other people's films. Especially when [...] is first seen, we wanted a build up, and then pan up, we see him, and then we don't see him. I love that." ...|$|E

But now you will {{understand}} why <b>I</b> <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> when you talk of my coming to your house. Your ways and my ways must be different." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gentlemen {{have often}} asked me that," [...] said Moodie slowly; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> and say little or nothing, and creep {{out of the}} way as well as I can. I am a man of few words; and if gentlemen were to be told one thing, they would be very apt, I suppose, to ask me another. But it happens just now, Mr. Coverdale, that you can tell me more about the maker of those little purses than I can tell you." ...|$|E
60|$|Again <b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> whereat {{he looked}} more {{disappointed}} than before.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> feebly, for <b>I</b> was {{longing to}} accept his offer.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> though <b>I</b> guessed {{well enough}} what night he meant.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{people here}} speak Dutch, and they cannot {{understand}} me, and I cannot understand them. And {{that is not}} the worst of it; they can't understand that I can't understand them. Sometimes the woman that comes to make my bed tells me something in Dutch, and I tell her that I can't understand. I know the Dutch for 'I can't understand.' Then she says, 'O!' and goes on to tell me over again, only now she tries to speak plainer--as if it could make any difference to me whether she speaks plain or not. <b>I</b> <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> and tell her I can't understand any thing. I tell her in French, and in English, and in Dutch. But it does not do any good, for she immediately begins again, and tells me the whole story all over again, trying to speak plainer than ever. I suppose she thinks that any body can understand Dutch, if she only speaks it plain enough to them.|$|E

5000|$|Todd was taunted {{by other}} {{students}} {{at her school}} for her low grades, a consequence of a language-based learning disability, and for the time she spent in hospital to treat her severe depression. [...] "It didn't really help that after {{she got out of}} the hospital recently some kids started calling her 'psycho' and saying she had been in the crazy hospital," [...] her mother said. [...] "She went to the hospital, she had therapy, she had counselling, she was on a good track. On the day she gets out, that happens. <b>I</b> <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> and I think, 'Are kids really that nasty, do they really not think, what if it was them?'" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> blankly, for <b>I</b> {{had never}} heard {{anything}} of the sort.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> in sorrow, a {{thrust of}} jealousy cutting me the while.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> {{with all}} <b>my</b> flush of joy changed to foolish resentment.|$|R

60|$|For {{an instant}} its great black hole yawned close, but <b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> and {{dismissed}} him. After {{a very brief}} toilet I hastened downstairs.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> {{and felt}} myself {{swelling}} with the inarticulate hate that possessed me.|$|R
60|$|Again <b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> and for {{the life}} of me I could say nothing.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> blankly, whereat they murmured {{together}} and made {{as though they}} would go.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> emphatically, {{guessing}} that I {{was to be}} seat {{on another}} proud mission.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> {{and looked}} at him. His head had dropped down on his chest again.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> Some {{instinct}} told me {{that they}} were professors. But I didn't say so.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked up}} at me as though asking for {{confirmation}} of her views. <b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> and <b>I</b> smiled {{down upon}} her {{a smile that}} was very full of confidence.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> Mr. Dick <b>shook</b> his, and sighed. 'Tell {{him about}} the Memorial,' said Mr. Dick.|$|R
60|$|I {{had heard}} {{something}} of Moissan, but I knew his artificial diamonds were very small. <b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> {{and paused}} {{in the act of}} dislodging the {{shavings}} which had drifted down my neck.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> silently, but {{pressed her}} hand, which, while she went on, still {{remained}} resting in mine.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> {{and said}} that I could not, and next moment was sorry, for she {{proceeded}} to explain.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> in {{token of}} my ignorance, and Ebbits looked {{compassion}} at me, while Zilla snorted her customary contempt.|$|R

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> It was {{not likely}} that I should know what Good might be talking about. He talks about so many things.|$|R
6000|$|... "Papa {{is getting}} quite sentimental," [...] whispered Jenny, {{loud enough for}} me to hear. <b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> at her impressively, and went on undaunted.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> impatiently, and {{collecting}} myself, I said, very slowly and somewhat unsteadily, [...] "Do you suspect {{me of being}} instrumental in taking it?" ...|$|R
