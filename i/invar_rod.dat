40|$|We {{expect that}} digital level will produce height reading quickly and reliably. But is the reading correct? That {{we must find}} out by {{calibrating}} rod scale or even better the rod and the level together. In this paper we have done both. For some years we have been comparing modern levelling systems ie. digital levels and bar code <b>invar</b> <b>rods</b> using the vertical comparator of the Finnish Geodetic Institute. Our customers come from Baltic and Nordic countries where the precise levelling work {{is still going on}} busily. In our laboratory it is possible to vary both sight length and temperature for simulating outdoor circumstances. In this study we included six digital levels and nine <b>invar</b> <b>rods,</b> which were calibrated in 2006 - 2008. Digital levels were made by Leica and Trimble. We used three meters long <b>invar</b> <b>rods</b> with aluminium frame. The aim of our research was to compare the results of system and rod calibrations to find out their characteristics. Our results showed that scale corrections of levelling systems are compatible with those of rods. We estimate that the accuracy of system calibration can be of order ± 3 µm/m with short sighting distance. According to our tests there is no clear dependence of sight length. But the thermal expansion factor of the whole levelling system can exceed remarkably the value attained purely from rod scale. For this ground we think that full calibration of digital levelling system is very important...|$|R
40|$|The {{vibrational}} {{aspects of}} recent disturbances {{at the low}} beta focusing quadrupoles, which caused proton beam loss at the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF), are discussed. Two low beta focusing quadrupoles are supported by a girder, which is extended over the CDF collision hall pit on each side. The low beta girder has a ledge mount support at an alcove's face and two <b>Invar</b> <b>rods</b> near the opposite end. Forced response measurements were taken on the low beta girder, where the power spectral density (PSD) function was used to obtain RMS displacement. The effects of local excitation due to operating equipment and near-field excitation due to ambient ground motion caused by local traffic are examined. The discussion explores dynamic response characteristics of the low beta quadrupoles and supporting girder using beam loss as the vibrational stability criteria. This paper also presents practical problem-solving approaches for similar accelerator components...|$|R
30|$|We also {{considered}} the scale error, {{which is considered}} to be the main factor involved in systematic errors from leveling surveys. A significant cause of such errors is the shift in scale due to thermal expansion of the leveling rod. However, in our survey, we used spear <b>invar</b> <b>rods</b> to minimize thermal expansion. In addition, we made a correction for thermal expansion using the linear expansion coefficient of spear invar. We also took temperature measurements {{at the time of the}} leveling surveys in order to estimate the correction value. We additionally checked the influence using a case where the linear expansion coefficient had an uncertainty of 5.0 [*]×[*] 10 − 7 /°C, where the temperature difference was 10  °C and where the maximum relative height from benchmark BM 34 was approximately 350  m. A scale error of only 1.75  mm was estimated, and this value was considered sufficiently small as to not significantly affect the results. Therefore, we concluded that the results were accurate enough to detect a deformation of greater than a few millimeters.|$|R
40|$|In {{academic}} {{studies and}} engineering works, it {{is required to}} determine height differences between points or the height of points itself in those applications such as measurements of national or local networks, vertical applications of bridge, dam and infrastructures, maintenance and control measurements, determination of vertical crustal movements, motorway, railway, sewerage and pipe line measurements. Height determination can be classified as geometric levelling, trigonometric levelling and GPS/Levelling depending on used instruments or the methods applied. They have advantages and disadvantages. The {{purpose of this study}} is to analyze the trigonometric levelling with using total station, which are capable of high accuracy observing vertical angles and distances, geometric levelling with using digital level and GPS/Levelling with using GPS observations. To fulfill this aim, a levelling line with 11 points was established in Alaeddin Keykubat Campus area of Selçuk University.

40|$|The {{levelling}} network installed and {{managed by the}} Osservatorio Vesuviano for monitoringvertical ground movements on Volcano island is currently made up of 100 benchmarks(bm) and extends about 24 km as a whole. The reference benchmark for calculating height variations is benchmark 1 A located at Volcano Piano, which is a relatively stable area {{as compared with the}} northern part of the island. The presently operating network has been enlarged and thickened several times since June 1976, when the first levelling line was installed and surveyed. Twentyseven surveys has been conducted between June 1976 and October 2003. Actually, the configuration of the network presents a greater density of benchmarks in the center-northern sector of the island. The measurement tecnique used is precise levelling. The surveys are performed with autolevelling instruments (Wild NA 2) equipped with optical micrometers and <b>invar</b> <b>rods.</b> The last levelling survey has been carried out in the first two weeks of October 2003. The comparison of September 1999 (previous levelling) with October 2003 data indicates a significant subsidence of the center-northern area of the island...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study {{of a new kind}} of Fabry-Perot long-baseline optical {{resonator}} proposed for gravitational waves interferometric detectors: the Mesa beam profile Fabry-Perot cavity. A detailed experimental work has been performed on a prototype built in the LIGO laboratories of the California Institute of Technology. The aim of this experiment is to explore all of the main properties of such an optical cavity including: the reliability of its control; beam distortions due to surface imperfections and misalignments; the efficiency of the coupling to a gaussian input beam. The advantage to use a non-spherical optics resonator consists in the possibility to significantly reduce test masses thermal noise which {{is expected to be the}} fundamental limit for advanced gravitational waves interferometric detectors, such as Advanced LIGO. It is possible to generate a flat-top, wider laser beam probe of such a detector just reshaping the profile of its mirrors. The characteristic ``Mexican hat' mirror profile has been designed to support a flat-top beam, the so-called Mesa beam. Three test mirrors have been manufactured by the LMA laboratory (Lyon, France) in order to study the behavior of this new family of laser beams in our Fabry Perot prototype. A brief introduction about the problem of estimating mirror thermal noises, their physical sources and how to treat them formally, using, for example, Levin's direct approach is presented. After that, this thesis deals with all the physical characteristic of finite size optical resonators and the related experimental issues like the lock acquisition techniques. A overview of the Mesa beam design and related theoretical issues is included. The second part of this thesis treats all the experimental issues of our experiment: a Fabry-Perot, folded, suspended optical resonator 7 meters long conceived to store Nd:YAG laser light with optics sizes scaled down from the Advanced LIGO baseline parameters. It is placed inside a vacuum pipe and the spacing between the mirrors is determined by three <b>INVAR</b> <b>rods.</b> A cavity finesse of about 100 is achieved by tuning the reflectivity of the input (flat) mirror. The other two mirrors, the folding mirror, and the end mirror, which can be either a spherical or a Mexican hat mirror, have high reflectivity coatings. During this year of operations, the cavity was always operated in air. The stability of the mechanics has been tested with a spherical mirror, 8 meters radius of curvature. The input and output optics layout has been developed to match and study this preliminary cavity configuration. The control electronics, necessary to keep the cavity locked on a resonance, has been made and assembled so that it is possible to use either a side-lock feedback on the laser frequency or the cavity length dithering technique. A high voltage driver circuit has been designed and assembled to drive the mirror piezo actuators. A preliminary study of the cavity beam profile was performed for the spherical optics configuration: several beam profile samples of the fundamental mode and higher order modes were compared to the theoretical predictions. The last part of this work was the characterization of the cavity behavior with the first Mexican hat mirror. Since spherical symmetry is lost for such a resonator, the resonant beam depends on the particular mirrors and input beam alignment. Beam profiles recorded were compared with realistic simulations based on the Fast Fourier Transform implementation of the beam propagation and using the actual Mexican hat mirror map. Finally, the first Mesa beam fundamental mode was acquired and analyzed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A high {{precision}} digital levelling system uses <b>invar</b> bar code <b>rods</b> and a linear CCD camera technique. The {{scale of the}} bar code {{is a function of}} temperature. The scale and a constant are determined by the rod calibration. When carrying out digital levelling, the scale of the whole system, in fact the scale given by the instrument, is expected to be equal with the scale of the rod. However, with time, the scale of an instrument and also a rod can change. To check the behavior of the whole system, i. e. rod and instrument together, we have to use the “system calibration ” procedure, where the height readings are taken from different sectors on the bar code rod and compared with their true values obtained by a laser interferometer. In the Finnish Geodetic Institute (FGI) automated rod calibrations have been carried out since 1996 using the FGI vertical laser rod comparator and system calibrations since 2002.
