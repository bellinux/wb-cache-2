The backup LSP {{does not necessarily}} {{need to have the}} same constrain in terms of bandwidth as the primary; it is possible to reserve less bandwidth on the backup LSP and not incur in packet loss when in use. This is because the bandwidth of the link is shared among the different LSPs and the reason why the previous explained protection scheme is not preferred. It is also true that the Backup LSP does not necessarily carry traffic unless the primary LSP fails. When this occurs, a <b>fault</b> <b>indication</b> signal (FIS) is sent back to the head-end LSR that will immediately switch the traffic to the backup LSP.

30|$|Energy-aware testing {{strategies}} {{are presented in}} [7, 24], and [25]. In [7], Chessa and Santi proposed an energy-efficient fault diagnosis protocol for wireless sensor networks. This protocol, called WSNDiag, is capable of diagnosing crash faults. Crash faults are permanent and the faulty sensors can not do any kind of communication. The diagnosis process begins after a fault-free sensor, or an external unit, asks for the diagnosis. Thus, the diagnosis works on demand, resulting in an economy of energy for the whole system. The protocol is capable of correct diagnosis in a system with up to t faulty units, where t<k(G) and k(G) stands for the connectivity of the system. In [24], an energy-efficient distributed approach improves network lifetime by detecting data faults locally in cluster heads. The type of data faults is identified by using trust and reputation concepts. The sensors that {{belong to the same}} cluster share and compare their readings. From these comparisons, each sensor generates a set of possible faulty neighbor sensors. The cluster head verifies which sensors present more <b>fault</b> <b>indications</b> to find the set of possible faulty sensors in the cluster.

More in detail, the work under discussion is focused on the Fault Detection, Isolation and Accommodation (FDIA) of redundant sensors when applied to Inertial Navigation Systems (INS). Cheol-Kwan Yang and Duk-Sun Shim have suggested the Averaged Parity Vector (APV) technique in order to improve the probability of correct isolation, as well as to reduce the rates of false alarms and wrong isolation. The proposed scheme exploits an accommodation threshold based on the error covariance of an estimated variable, which is related to the navigation accuracy of the INS. Moreover, as this accommodation threshold is used also for the fault detection, the APV algorithm is able only to detect non-tolerable faults. Thus, if the conditional probability of correct isolation is given, the minimum number of measurement data samples is determined with respect to the considered fault size. On the other hand, the fault accommodation provided by the APV method is based on the computation of averaged <b>fault</b> <b>indication</b> functions. Hence, if the maximum averaged <b>fault</b> <b>indication</b> function is greater than the accommodation threshold, the corresponding sensor will be excluded. In order to obtain better navigation accuracy, the use of the accommodation threshold is suggested, rather than the common thresholds determined from a given false alarm rate. Finally, computer simulations and experimental results using real data are proposed and compared with traditional FDI schemes for assessing the validity of the proposed APV technique...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Today, in electric power systems, a large amount of data is made readily available at the occurrence of a fault due to the use of advanced communication systems, digital relays and fault recorders. Such systems are intended to obtain data from contacts of the relays and circuit breakers under operation. In addition, corresponding voltages and currents are recorded during prefault, fault and postfault periods. Restoration of power Systems after a fault occurred requires quick judgment. Hence, fault analysis, as the first step of restoration is very important. However, since faults in power systems are various and relaying systems may be complex, fault analysis is difficult to automate. Common practice in power utility companies, today, is to perform fault analysis by expert operators using their knowledge about the power systems and experience with past faults. Because of the time required to deal with complex fault situations, detailed fault analysis can not be performed by human operators in a short time. Therefore, on-line automated fault analysis system is strongly desired. Traditional approaches to the problem of analysis is to construct a heuristic, rule-based system which embodies a portion of the compiled experience of a human expert. These systems perform fault analysis by mapping <b>fault</b> <b>indications</b> to <b>fault</b> hypotheses. 'These hypotheses are used as inputs for next level of rules.

40|$|The rapid {{progress}} made in integrating enormous numbers of transistors {{on a single}} chip is {{making it possible for}} hardware designers to implement more complex hardware architectures in their designs. Nowadays digital telecommunication systems are implementing several forms of SOC (System-On-Chip) structures. These SOCs usually contain a microprocessor, several DSP cores (Digital-Signal-Processors), other hardware blocks, on-chip memories and peripherals. As new IC process technologies are deployed, with decreasing geometrical dimensions, the probabilities of hardware faults to occur during operation are increasing. Testing SOCs is becoming a very complex issue due to the increasing complexity of the design and the increasing need of a test mechanism that is able to achieve acceptable fault coverage in a short test application time with low power consumption without the use of external logic testers. As a part of the overall test strategy for a SOC, functional self-testing of a DSP core is considered in this project to be applied in the field. This test is used to verify whether <b>fault</b> <b>indications</b> in systems are caused by permanent hardware faults in the DSP. If so, the DSP where the fault is located needs to be taken out of operation, and the board it sits on will be later replaced. If not, the operational state can be restored, and the system will become fully functional again. The main purpose of this project is to develop a functional self-test of a DSP core, and to evaluate the characteristics of the test. This project also involves proposing a scheme on how to apply a functional test on a DSP core in an embedded environment, and how to retrieve results from the test. The test program shall run at system speed. To develop and measure the quality of the test program, two different coverage metrics were used. The first is the code coverage metric achieved by simulating the test program on the RTL representation of the DSP. The second metric used was the fault coverage achieved. The fault coverage of the test was calculated using a commercial Fault Simulator working on a gate-level representation of the DSP. The results achieved in this report show that this proposed approach can achieve acceptable levels of fault coverage in short execution time without the need for external testers which makes it possible to perform the self-test in the field. This approach has the unique property of not requiring any hardware modifications in the DSP design, and the ability of testing several DSPs in parallel...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{research}} is to enhance the current procedures of designing decision support systems (DSSs) used by decision-makers to comprehend the current situation better in cases where the available amount of information required to make an informed decision is limited. It has been suggested that the highest level of situation awareness can be achieved by a thorough grasp of particular key elements that, if put together, will synthesize the current status of an environment. However, there are many cases where a decision-maker needs to make a decision when no information is available, the source of information is questionable, or the information has yet to arrive. On the other hand, in timely critical decision-making, the availability of information might become a curse rather than a blessing, as the more information is available the more time is required to process it. In time critical situations, time is an expensive commodity not always affordable. For instance, consider a surgeon performing cardiac surgery. With all the new advances in monitoring equipment and medical laboratory tests, there would be too much information to account for before the surgeon could decide on his next “cut”. A DSS could help reduce the amount of information by converting it into the bigger picture through summarizing. The research resulted in a new innovated theory that combines the philosophical comparative approach to probability, the frequency interpretation of probability, dynamic Bayesian networks and the expected utility theory. It enables engineers to write self-learning algorithms that use example of behaviours to model situations, evaluate and make decisions, diagnose problems, and/or find the most probable consequences in real-time. The new theory was particularly applied to the problems of validating equipment readings in an aircraft, flight data analysis, prediction of passengers behaviours, and real-time monitoring and prediction of patients’ states in intensive care units (ICU). The algorithm was able to pinpoint the faulty equipment from between a group of equipment giving false <b>fault</b> <b>indications,</b> an important improvement over the current fault detection procedures. In addition, the network was able to give to the aircraft pilot recommendations about the optimal speed and altitude that will result in reducing fuel consumptions and thereby saving costs and extending equipment lives.

In addition, the network can guide nurses to best practices, and to summarize patients’ current state in terms of an overall index. Furthermore, it can use data collected by hospitals to improve its accuracy and to diagnose patients in real-time and predict their state well-ahead to the future...|$|R
