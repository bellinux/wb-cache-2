5|$|Tension {{pneumothorax}} {{occurs when}} the opening that allows air to enter the pleural space functions as a one-way valve, allowing more air to enter with <b>every</b> <b>breath</b> but none to escape. The body compensates by increasing the respiratory rate and tidal volume (size of each breath), worsening the problem. Unless corrected, hypoxia (decreased oxygen levels) and respiratory arrest eventually follow.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of '4 Minutes', Tim had a vision from the {{beginning}} of how things should go, especially sonically... When I opened up the session of '4 Minutes', there was so much going on that I knew right away that the hard part would be {{to make sure that the}} vocals would cut through and were right in the pocket. Beginning with working on the vocals was the only way to achieve this. After that I formed all the other parts around the vocals. The other challenge was to make sure that everything in the track sounded clear and that you could hear every instrument, every syllable, <b>every</b> <b>breath.</b> Also, I do almost always work linear in time on a track. It's easier, because when you're done, you're done. So I keep working on section after section, until I get to the end of the track and then I know the whole mix is pretty close.|$|E
25|$|Pressure {{support is}} a {{spontaneous}} mode of ventilation also named Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV).

500|$|As part of Charles' Grammy Award for Album of the Year-winning Genius Loves Company, {{the song}} {{proved to be}} the most popular and {{critically}} acclaimed on the album. Although the song had its early detractors, it received mostly favorable reviews. Several reviewers noted the complementarity of Jones and Charles. The Daily Vault Jason Warburg described the song as a [...] "jazzy, slinky pas de deux" [...] in which Charles matches Jones note for note." [...] JazzTimes Christopher Loudon said Charles [...] "blends seamlessly with Jones on a velvet-and-buckram" [...] performance. The song was described by the Orlando Sentinel Jim Abbott as a recreation of one of the gems from Charles' country music phase of the 1960s that produced the perfect [...] "combination of voices and instruments" [...] with Preston's accompanying role on Hammond B3. As opposed to other tracks on the album, when Charles' voice was understated, this song was said to represent his [...] "indomitable spirit", while Jones performed as [...] "an empathetic foil, [...] her warm, lazy vocals meshing convivially with his over a spare but funky arrangement". Author Mike Evans wrote that [...] "there's a mutual warmth of purpose in <b>every</b> <b>breath</b> [...] take" [...] on the song. Music Week staff noted the timeliness of the release with the biographical film Ray in theaters and described the song as soulful, that finely combines Charles' [...] "deep, honeyed growl with Jones's lighter timber", while noting Preston for his [...] "sweeping" [...] organ work.|$|E
500|$|In 1957, Sinatra {{released}} Close to You, A Swingin' Affair! and Where Are You?—his {{first album}} in stereo, with Gordon Jenkins. Granata considers [...] "Close to You" [...] {{to have been}} thematically his closest concept album to perfection during the [...] "golden" [...] era, and Nelson Riddle's finest work, which was [...] "extremely progressive" [...] by the stands of the day. It is structured like a three-act play, each commencing with the songs [...] "With <b>Every</b> <b>Breath</b> I Take", [...] "Blame It On My Youth" [...] and [...] "It Could Happen to You". For Granata, Sinatra's A Swingin' Affair! and swing music predecessor Songs for Swingin' Lovers! solidified [...] "Sinatra's image as a 'swinger', from both a musical and visual standpoint". Buddy Collette considered the swing albums to have been heavily influenced by Sammy Davis, Jr., and noted that when he worked with Sinatra in the mid-1960s he approached a song much differently than he had done in the early 1950s. On June 9, 1957, he performed in a 62-minute concert conducted by Riddle at the Seattle Civic Auditorium, his first appearance in Seattle since 1945. The recording was first released as a bootleg, but in 1999 Artanis Entertainment Group officially released it as the Sinatra '57 in Concert live album, after Sinatra's death. In 1958 Sinatra released the album Come Fly with Me with Billy May. It reached the top spot on the Billboard album chart in its second week, remaining at the top for five weeks, and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year at the inaugural Grammy Awards. The title song, [...] "Come Fly With Me", written especially for him, {{would become one of}} his best known standards. On May 29 he recorded seven songs in a single session, more than double the usual yield of a recording session, and an eighth was planned, [...] "Lush Life", but Sinatra found it too technically demanding. In September, Sinatra released Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely, a stark collection of introspective saloon songs and blues-tinged ballads which proved a huge commercial success, spending 120 weeks on Billboards album chart and peaking at No.1. Cuts from this LP, such as [...] "Angel Eyes" [...] and [...] "One for My Baby (and One More for the Road)", would remain staples of the [...] "saloon song" [...] segments of Sinatra's concerts.|$|E

2500|$|There are 5 basic {{ventilatory}} patterns: VC-CMV, VC-IMV, PC-CMV, PC-IMV, and PC-CSV.

The group reemerged with a dramatically changed look and sound on the 1977 release of the GMA Dove Award nominated, Fresh Surrender. The album, their best selling to that date, produced seven back-to-back hits, including, Masters' title track and [...] "I Need You" [...] and Short's, [...] "I'm Gonna Rise", [...] "Make Me An Instrument", and [...] "With <b>Every</b> <b>Breath</b> I Take".

2500|$|By Saturday, the {{infection}} had died down, and she flew to Kona. On Sunday Wellington published a blog post {{in which she}} referred to Sun Tzu's book The Art of War and elaborated on how war strategy {{could be applied to}} triathlon, saying that she hadn't lost her fight because of her injuries and quoting Bella Bayliss's dictum that [...] "It's not a race, it's war." [...] The flight had caused her leg to swell up again, but she was still able to do some bike and run training. On Monday she tried a four-kilometre swim, her first hard swim since the crash; this produced pain in her pectoral muscle, which worsened over subsequent training sessions. On Tuesday she tried another swim session: after 1km she had to stop, and again had to be lifted out of the pool by Lowe. She later wote, [...] "I was 'crying into my goggles', and described the pain as 'unbearable'", adding, [...] "I was convinced I'd broken my rib. <b>Every</b> <b>breath</b> hurt and I couldn't move my arm properly." [...] The previous day Mike Leahy had begun treating Wellington using his Active Release Therapy (ART); he instructed her {{to go to the hospital}} for tests, not wanting to continue ART treatment if the problem was a fracture. The hospital's first concern, from the swollen state of her leg, was that she might have a pulmonary embolism. Six hours of tests showed that she had no fractures, nor any embolism, but that she did have damaged pectoral and intercostal muscles; the badly infected state of her leg was obvious from the appalling smell when the bandages were removed.|$|E

30|$|Mechanical {{ventilation}} {{with high}} volumes/pressures induces ventilatory induced lung injury (VILI).

50|$|The lack of {{literacy}} and numeracy skills among Traditional Birth Attendants (TBAs) made diagnosis unreliable, since innumerate TBAs {{were unable to}} use watches or counting methods to assess breathing rates in infants.
