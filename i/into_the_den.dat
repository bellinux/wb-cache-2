25|$|Nick recuperates in a {{military}} hospital in Saigon with no knowledge of his friends. After being released, he goes AWOL and aimlessly stumbles through the red-light district at night. He encounters Julien Grinda, a Frenchman, outside a gambling den where men play Russian roulette for money. Grinda entices the reluctant Nick to participate and leads him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>den.</b> Mike {{is present in the}} den, watching the game, but the two friends do not notice each other at first. When Mike does see Nick, he is unable to get his attention. When Nick is introduced into the game, he grabs the gun, fires it at the current contestant, and then again at his own temple, causing the audience to riot in protest. Grinda hustles Nick outside to his car to escape the angry mob. Mike cannot catch up with them as they speed away.|$|E
500|$|In May 2002, {{hundreds}} of hooligans attaching themselves to Millwall {{were involved in}} disorder around the ground, after the team lost a play-off game to Birmingham City. It was described by the BBC {{as one of the}} worst cases of civil disorder seen in Britain in recent times. A police spokeswoman said that 47 police officers and 24 police horses were injured, and the Metropolitan Police considered suing the club after the events. The then chairman Theo Paphitis responded that Millwall could not be blamed for the actions of a mindless minority who attach themselves to the club. [...] "The problem of mob violence is not solely a Millwall problem, it is not a football problem, it is a problem which plagues the whole of our society", he said. Paphitis later introduced a membership scheme whereby only fans who would be prepared to join and carry membership cards would be allowed <b>into</b> <b>The</b> <b>Den.</b> Scotland Yard withdrew its threat to sue, stating: [...] "In light of the efforts made and a donation to a charity helping injured police officers, the Metropolitan Police Service has decided not to pursue legal action against Millwall F.C. in relation to the disorder". Some legal experts said it would have been difficult to hold a football club responsible for something that occurred away from its ground and involved people who did not attend the match. The scheme introduced by Paphitis now only applies to perceived high-risk away games. Many fans blame the scheme for diminishing Millwall's away support, such as at Leeds United where fans are issued with vouchers which are then exchanged for tickets at a designated point of West Yorkshire Police's choosing {{on the day of the}} game. Also, early kick-off times arranged by the police often result in only a few hundred fans making the trip.|$|E

50|$|Dens evaginatus is a {{condition}} found in teeth where the outer surface appears to form an extra bump or cusp. Premolars {{are more likely to}} be affected than any other tooth. This may be seen more frequently in Asians, but almost exclusively in Down Syndrome. The pulp of the tooth may extend <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>dens</b> evaginatus. There is a risk of <b>the</b> <b>dens</b> evaginatus chipping off in normal function. Hence this condition requires monitoring as the tooth can lose its blood and nerve supply as a result and may need root canal treatment.|$|R

Bears were darted in anthill, soil, or uprooted tree dens on eleven occasions, but two bears in rock dens fled and were darted outside <b>the</b> <b>den.</b> We used medetomidine at 0. 02 – 0. 06 mg/kg and zolazepam-tiletamine at 0. 9 – 2. 8 mg/kg for anesthesia.

Once anesthetized, bears were removed from <b>the</b> <b>dens.</b> In nine bears, arterial blood samples were analyzed immediately with a portable blood gas analyzer.
