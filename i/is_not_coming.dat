25|$|Just after Didi and Gogo {{have been}} {{particularly}} selfish and callous, the boy comes to say that Godot <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>coming.</b> The boy (or pair of boys) may be seen to represent meekness and hope before compassion is consciously excluded by an evolving personality and character, and in which case may be the youthful Pozzo and Lucky. Thus Godot is compassion and fails to arrive every day, as he says he will. No-one is concerned that a boy is beaten. In this interpretation, there is the irony that only by changing their hearts to be compassionate can the characters fixed to the tree move on and cease {{to have to wait}} for Godot.|$|E

Wenger believed the result showed that Arsenal were [...] "ready for the season", albeit admitting that the defence had trouble coping with Yorke. He thought it was [...] "...psychologically important to beat United, especially after the great run they have had". Wenger confirmed afterwards that Anelka would sign for Real Madrid: [...] "I hope everything will be finalised {{in the next couple of}} days. In any case, he <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>coming</b> back here, and although the contract is not signed yet, I hope it will be after his medical and that is the end of it."

500|$|In 2009, {{following}} {{the announcement that}} As the World Turns would be cancelled in 2010, rumors that Howarth would return to OLTL regained momentum. The rumors were further fueled by an August 2010 episode of OLTL, in which Howarth's picture was shown and a delirious T√©a stated that the current Todd (St. John) was not Todd Manning. This resulted in what Dan Kroll of the website Soap Opera Central.com described as fans [...] "rac to their computers {{to figure out the}} meaning of the scene". Kroll speculated that the scene was [...] "crafted merely to get fans talking, or was it a hint to viewers something big was coming down the pike?" [...] Soap Opera Network, citing unnamed sources and pointing to the 2010 episode, reported on their website that they had [...] "learned exclusively Howarth [...] indeed be returning" [...] to the series in the near future. Soap Opera Digest columnist Carolyn Hinsey dismissed the report, stating on her Facebook page, [...] "Seriously, stop with the Howarth misinformation here please. [...] He <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>coming</b> back to OLTL. Case closed." [...] Some fans were convinced that St. John's character was an impostor, while others were not; although Howarth eventually returned as Todd in 2011, his return was initially accompanied with fan debate regarding what role he would play, Todd Manning or a new character.|$|E

2500|$|As the Arctic {{continues}} receiving {{energy from}} the sun during this time, the land, which is mostly free of snow by now, can warm up on clear days when the wind <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>coming</b> from the cold ocean. [...] Over the Arctic Ocean the snow cover on the sea ice disappears and ponds of melt water start to form on the sea ice, further {{reducing the amount of}} sunlight the ice reflects and helping more ice melt. [...] Around the edges of the Arctic Ocean the ice will melt and break up, exposing the ocean water, which absorbs almost all of the solar radiation that reaches it, storing the energy in the water column. [...] By July and August, most of the land is bare and absorbs more than 80% of the sun's energy that reaches the surface. [...] Where sea ice remains, in the central Arctic Basin and the straits between the islands in the Canadian Archipelago, the many melt ponds and lack of snow cause about half of the sun's energy to be absorbed (Serreze and Barry, 2005), but this mostly goes toward melting ice since the ice surface cannot warm above freezing.|$|E

2500|$|Lynsey {{decides to}} {{temporarily}} leave the village. Hassan revealed Cheryl's brother, Brendan Brady (Emmett J.

The actress said that this leaves Lynsey to fight her own battles, teasing that the situation gets [...] "even worse before it gets better". Lynsey discovers Texas has been speaking to a girl online. Hassan explained that when Texas is telling Lynsey about the girl she realise that the correspondent is actually Silas who is planning to hurt Texas.

Brendan arrives at the woods and discovers the body of Rae Wilson (Alice Barlow) in his car before the police arrive and arrest Brendan. Lynsey soon after returns home.|$|E
