5|$|As General Manager, Isiah Thomas quickly staffed the {{management}} positions {{with his own}} personnel, naming long-time Detroit Pistons assistant Brendan Malone as the Raptors' head coach. The team's roster was then filled {{as a result of}} an expansion draft in 1995. Following a coin flip, Toronto was given first choice and selected Chicago Bulls point guard and three-point specialist B. J. Armstrong. Armstrong refused to report for training, and Thomas promptly traded him to the Golden State Warriors for power forwards Carlos Rogers and Victor Alexander. Thomas then selected a wide range of players in the expansion draft, including veterans Jerome <b>Kersey,</b> Willie Anderson and his former Pistons teammate John Salley.|$|E
5|$|Local weavers {{specialised}} in {{the production}} of <b>kersey,</b> a hardwearing and inexpensive woollen fabric that was often used for military uniforms; by the 16thcentury Halifax and the surrounding Calder Valley was the largest producer of the material in England. In the final part of the manufacturing process the cloth was hung outdoors on large structures known as tenterframes and left to dry, after having been conditioned by a fulling mill. Daniel Defoe wrote a detailed account of what he had been told of the gibbet's history during his visit to Halifax in Volume 3 of his A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain, published in 1727.|$|E
5|$|Dunster {{had become}} a centre for woollen and {{clothing}} production by the 13th century, with the market dating back to at least 1222, and {{a particular kind of}} <b>kersey</b> or broadcloth became known as 'Dunsters'. The prosperity of Dunster was based on the wool trade, with profits helping to pay for the construction of the tower of the Priory Church of St George and provide other amenities. By the 15th century the importance of the town was declining particularly due to the silting up of the harbour. The Luttrell's wanted to maintain the importance as a market and in 1609 George Luttrell, of the Luttrell family constructed the market to shelter traders and their wares from the rain and provide more security for their wares. The exact date of construction is debated and a variety of dates are given in different sources, however 1609 is considered the most likely.|$|E
50|$|Death Wish {{received}} mixed to extremely negative reviews {{upon its}} release, {{due to its}} support of vigilantism, but it affected U.S. audiences and began widespread debate over {{how to deal with}} rampant crime. The film's graphic violence, particularly the brutal rape scene of <b>Kersey's</b> daughter, as well as the explicit portrayal of <b>Kersey's</b> premeditated slayings, was considered exploitative, but realistic {{in the context of an}} urban U.S. atmosphere of rising crime rates.|$|R

5|$|The Union Greenbackers {{held their}} {{convention}} first, meeting in St. Louis in March 1880. Although {{much of the}} young party's leadership remained with the Eastern faction, the March gathering included Solon Chase and <b>Kersey</b> Graves, among other third-party notables. They nominated Stephen D. Dillaye, a New Jersey lawyer and journalist, for President and Barzillai J. Chambers, a Texas merchant and surveyor, for Vice President. Because Dillaye had previously declared he {{was not interested in}} the nomination, many delegates protested, seeing Dillaye as a placeholder for eventual re-unification with the National Greenbackers. Dillaye himself supported reunification, and Pomeroy also urged the delegates to send representatives to the Easterners' convention, which was set for June 1880 in Chicago. The majority agreed with the sentiment, and Union Greenbackers gathered in Chicago along with National Greenbackers as their convention began a few months later.|$|E

50|$|An Universal Etymological English Dictionary was a {{dictionary}} compiled by Nathan Bailey (or Nathaniel Bailey) and {{first published in}} London in 1721. It {{was the most popular}} English dictionary of the eighteenth century. As an indicator of its popularity it reached its 20th edition in 1763 and its 27th edition in 1794. Its last edition (30th) was in 1802. It was a little over 900 pages long. In compiling his dictionary, Bailey borrowed greatly from John <b>Kersey's</b> Dictionarium Anglo-Britannicum (1706), which in turn drew from the later editions of Edward Phillips's The New World of English Words. Like <b>Kersey's</b> dictionary, Bailey's dictionary {{was one of the first}} monolingual English dictionaries to focus on defining words in common usage, rather than just difficult words.|$|R

With Stewart often unavailable to Surrey due to England duties, Batty was able to enjoy regular first team action, often opening the batting when Mark Butcher was also playing for England. Batty was a regular player in Surrey's sustained success, winning three county championships {{around the turn of the}} century.|$|E

50|$|The wool {{trade was}} {{established}} by 1249, and the manufacture and trading of woollen cloth, especially serge, peaked in the 16th century when the town reached the height of its prosperity.

50|$|He {{was mainly}} {{occupied}} with lexicography. The sixth edition of Phillipss New World of Words, {{which was published}} in 1706, was edited by him (Pref to Dict. Anglo-Britannicum, 1 708). He greatly added to the number of words, and published a seventh edition in 1720. Another dictionary, the New English Dictionary, of which the first edition is said to have appeared in 1702 (2nd 1713, 3rd 1731, &c.), was also assigned on the title-page to J. K., but <b>Kerseys</b> responsibility for the work has been questioned. In 1708 was printed his Dictionarium Anglo-Britannicum, comprehending a brief explication of all sorts of difficult words; a new edition in 1715 contained words and phrases made use of in our ancient statutes, old records, charters; the third edition appeared in 1721. The date of his death is uncertain. From <b>Kerseys</b> Dictionarium Thomas Chatterton borrowed part of his archaic vocabulary.|$|R
25|$|The Phoenix Block is a {{collection}} of buildings at 106–108 West Washington St. Today, only two of the original four buildings that made up the Phoenix Block remain. The Phoenix Block was so dubbed by the Daily Pantagraph as a remark on how quickly the buildings rose from the ashes after a fire in 1855. Originally, the buildings' upper floor served as offices for lawyers who tried cases in the original wood frame courthouse. The <b>Kersey</b> H. Fell Building of 1856 is one of downtown Bloomington's oldest structures. The Fell Building housed the office of local attorney <b>Kersey</b> Fell. His second floor office is the place where it is claimed that Jesse Fell first suggested to Abraham Lincoln he should run for president. Aside from the law offices the third floor once housed the Illinois Natural History Museum, in 1857, {{which was one of the}} first museums in Illinois. The storefronts have been home to numerous merchants over the years. From 1905 to 1922 Homuth Jewelry had a location along the block and Sorg's Jewelers had a location on the Phoenix Block from 1946 until 1988. In addition five other jewelers have had businesses along this block at some point in its past.|$|E
25|$|The two {{remaining}} original {{buildings on the}} Phoenix Block, {{one of which is}} the <b>Kersey</b> H. Fell building, are done in the Greek Revival style of architecture. They share a common wall and use simple stone lentils and sills in the windows. The storefronts are accented by columns. The common wall helped to increase the speed which the Phoenix Block was constructed at. So eager were merchants to occupy the storefronts that several stores opened for business while workers were still constructing the second and third floors of the buildings.|$|E
25|$|By the 15th century, Colne {{had become}} the main market town in the area with markets (latterly held on Tuesdays) and a major centre for the woollen trade, in {{particular}} {{for the production of}} lightweight <b>kersey.</b> With the Industrial Revolution, cotton manufacturing became the main industry in the town, fuelled by the completion of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal in 1816, and by the arrival of the railway in 1848. By 1891 there were 30 cotton mills listed in Colne with more in the surrounding areas of Trawden and Laneshaw Bridge. The largest had 2,400 looms and the smallest 56.|$|E

It has been rumored that Denzel Washington made his screen debut as an uncredited alley mugger, because, in a long shot, he appears to resemble him, but according to Washington himself, that is not true. Actress Helen Martin, who had a minor role, subsequently appeared in the television sitcoms Good Times and 227. Sonia Manzano (Maria from Sesame Street), has an uncredited role as a supermarket checkout clerk.
