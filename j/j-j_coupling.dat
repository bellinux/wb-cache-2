5000|$|The {{types of}} state-to-state {{transitions}} available to electrons during an Auger event {{are dependent on}} several factors, ranging from initial excitation energy to relative interaction rates, yet are often dominated by a few characteristic transitions. Because {{of the interaction between}} an electrons spin and orbital angular momentum (spin-orbit coupling) and the concomitant energy level splitting for various shells in an atom, {{there are a variety of}} transition pathways for filling a core hole. Energy levels are labeled using a number of different schemes such as the <b>j-j</b> <b>coupling</b> method for heavy elements (Z ≥ 75), the Russell-Saunders L-S method for lighter elements (Z < 20), and a combination of both for intermediate elements. The <b>j-j</b> <b>coupling</b> method, which is historically linked to X-ray notation, is almost always used to denote Auger transitions. Thus for a [...] transition, K represents the core level hole, [...] the relaxing electrons initial state, and [...] the emitted electrons initial energy state. Figure 1(b) illustrates this transition with the corresponding spectroscopic notation. The energy level of the core hole will often determine which transition types will be favored. For single energy levels, i.e. K, transitions can occur from the L levels, giving rise to strong KLL type peaks in an Auger spectrum. Higher level transitions can also occur, but are less probable. For multi-level shells, transitions are available from higher energy orbitals (different n, ℓ quantum numbers) or energy levels within the same shell (same n, different ℓ number). The result are transitions of the type LMM and KLL along with faster Coster-Kronig transitions such as LLM. While Coster-Kronig transitions are faster, they are also less energetic and thus harder to locate on an Auger spectrum. As the atomic number Z increases, so too does the number of potential Auger transitions. Fortunately, the strongest electron-electron interactions are between levels that are close together, giving rise to characteristic peaks in an Auger spectrum. KLL and LMM peaks are some of the most commonly identified transitions during surface analysis. Finally, valence band electrons can also fill core holes or be emitted during KVV-type transitions.|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} part of this paper, we review the {{assumption}} of the L-S coupling scheme, with which we derive the electronic states arising from a given atomic configuration. Then, with the aid of the spectral data of Group 15 elements, it becomes clear that the assumption of the L-S coupling scheme is no longer valid as we go farther and farther down the Periodic Table. In the second part, we introduce the <b>j-j</b> <b>coupling</b> scheme, which is seldom covered in standard inorganic chemistry texts, and contrast the assumptions of the two schemes. Next, we use two worked examples to demonstrate the derivation of electronic states with the <b>j-j</b> <b>coupling</b> scheme.

40|$|Irradiation {{of atomic}} {{europium}} {{isolated in the}} solid rare gases, with low intensity laser excitation of the y 8 P ← a 8 S resonance transition at ca. 465 nm, is found to produce singly charged europium cations (Eu+) in large amounts in xenon and in smaller amounts in argon. Confirmation {{of the formation of}} matrix-isolated Eu+ is obtained from characteristic absorption bands in the UV and in the visible spectral regions. The luminescence produced with excitation of the cation bands is presented in greatest detail for Eu/Xe and assigned. Excitation of the 4 f 7 (8 S 7 / 2) 6 p 3 / 2 absorption bands of Eu+ between 390 and 410 nm produces emission which is quite distinct from that resulting from excitation of the 4 f 7 (8 S 7 / 2) 6 p 1 / 2 absorption (430 to 450 nm) features. The latter consists of narrow, resolved emission bands with Stokes shifts ten times smaller than the former. The observed spectral differences are discussed in relation to the different spatial symmetries of the p 3 / 2 and p 1 / 2 orbitals in these <b>j-j</b> <b>coupled</b> (7 / 2, 3 / 2) J and the (7 / 2, 1 / 2) J levels. Møller-Plesset calculations are conducted to obtain the molecular parameters of the neutral Eu-RG and cationic Eu+-RG diatomics (RG = Ar, Kr, Xe). From the short bond lengths and the strong binding energies obtained for the Eu+-RG species, these values suggest the isolation of the ion in small, possibly interstitial sites especially in xenon. In contrast, but consistent with previous work [O. Byrne and J. G. McCaffrey, J. Chem. Phys. 134, 124501 (2011) ], the interaction potentials calculated herein for the Eu-RG diatomics suggest that the neutral Eu atom occupies tetra-vacancy (tv) and hexa-vacancy (hv) sites in the solid rare gas hosts. Possible reasons for the facile production of Eu+ in the solid rare gases are discussed. The mechanism proposed is that atomic europium is also acting as an electron acceptor, providing a temporary trap for the ionised electron in the matrices...|$|R
40|$|Paramagnetic {{resonance}} (p. r.) at {{low temperatures}} {{has been investigated}} {{in a number of}} substances in the solid state. Paramagnetic ions in the solid state are subjected to strong crystalline electric fields which profoundly modify the magnetic properties of the free ion. The orbital momentum of the free ion is completely or partially "quenched", leaving the spin momentum unaffected, except to a small extent due to spin-orbit coupling. The ground state consists of a number of levels, generally singlets or doublets. The separations of these levels may be varied by the application of an external magnetic field. If two levels have energies W 1 and W 2 and an external r. f. magnetic field, of frequency v such that h v = W 1 - W 2, is applied, transitions can be excited between the levels, within the limitations of certain selection rules. As the population of the two levels depends upon the Boltzman distribution there is a nett absorption of energy from the r. f. field when transitions occur. If this energy is lost to the crystal lattice quickly enough it is not reradiated. In practice a fixed frequency is chosen and the separation of the energy levels is adjusted by applying an external magnetic field so that the above condition is satisfied. By studying the fields at which the absorption occurs the position of the energy levels in zero field can be inferred. The energies of the levels may be expressed concisely {{in the form of a}} "spin hamiltonlan" which involves a number of parameters which have to be found experimentally. The general spin hamiltonian for an ion in a field of rhombic symmetry is: H = β(g x H x S x + g y H y S y + g z H z S z) + D [S 2 z - 1 ⁄ 3 S(S + 1) ] + E(S 2 x - S 2 y) + A x S x I x + A y S y I y + A z S z I z S is the effective spin chosen so that the multiplicity of the ground state is 2 S + l, β is the Bohr magneton, the g's are spectroscopic splitting factors along the axes of the crystal field. D represents the effect of the axial component of the field along the z axis and E represents the rhombic component of the crystal field. The transitions between the levels defined by these parameters give rise to the so-called fine structure lines. I is the nuclear spin and the terms in A, S and I represent the interaction between the magnetic moments of the electron and of the nucleus. This interaction splits each fine structure line into 2 I + l equally Intense, equally spaced hyperfine lines. Thus the number of hyperfine lines defines the nuclear spin unambiguously. Also the separatlon between the lines proportional to tbe nuclear magnetic moment so that in certain cases this can be estimated. The specimens used have usually consisted of single crystals of a diamagnetic salt containing about 1 % of an isomorphous paramagnetic salt. This dilution separates the paramagnetic ions and reduces tbe line width caused by their mutual interaction. Tbe experimental arrangement is of the standard type used in Oxford. Some refinements of technique have been used for particular experiments which needed them. Experiments have been performed at wavelengths between 10 em and 0. 8 mm. A klystron oscillator, run from a stabilised power pack, feeds power to a half wave resonant cavity which contains tbe sample placed in a position where the r. f. magnetic field is strong. This cavity can be placed in a dewar vessel of refrigerant and between tbe poles of an electromagnet. A wavemeter measures the wavelength and a crystal detector rectifies tbe power coupled out of the resonant cavity. The external field has a small 50 c/s modulation superimposed on it so that an absorption signal is swept through 100 times a second. The signal from the detector may then be amplified in a video-amplifier. If the amplified signal is fed to the Y-plates of an oscilloscope, which has a correctly phased 50 c/s time base, the trace displays a graph of absorption agalnst magnetic field within the region covered by the field modulation. This technique enables a spectrum to be analysed very rapidly. Complex Cyanides The p. r. spectra of two complex cyanides of divalent ions, K 4 V(CN) 6 3 H 2 O and K 4 Mn(CN) 6 3 H 2 O, have been studied. The orbital momentum of the vanadous ion is completely quenched so that it is in an S = 3 / 2 state and its behaviour resembles that of the same ion in ionic crystals. The g-value, 1. 992, is closer to the free spin value and the crystal field parameters, D = - 0. 0264 ± 0. 0004 em - 1 and E = - 0. 0072 ± 0. 0004 cm - 1, are smaller showing that the effect of higher levels is less than in the ionic salts. The hyperfine structure constant A = - 0. 00555 ± 0. 00003 cm - 1 is only 36 % smaller than in the ionic salts, showing that the configurational interaction which produces the hyperfine structure is not greatly modified by the covalent bonding. In the manganous ion the cubic field does not completely lift the orbital degeneracy of the ground state. The lowest triplet is split into a singlet and a higher doublet by the rhombic component of the crystal field so that the g-values differ widely from the free spin value. The ion behaves with effective spin S = 1 / 2 and has g-valuee g x = 2. 624 Â± 0. 008, g y = 2. 182 ± 0. 008 and g z = 0. 72 ± 0. 05. The hyperfine structure is also anisotropic and the hyperfine structure constants are A x = 0. 00845 Â± 0. 00005 cm - 1, A y = 0. 00465 Â± 0. 00005 cm - 1 and A z = 0. 0083 ± 0. 0013 cm - 1. The manganous ion in this type of compound resembles the titanic ion in ionic compounds and an attempt has been made to fit the parameters with the titanium theory of Abragam and Pryce (1951). This gives reasonable values for the configurational interaction constant and the mean value of the radius of the electron orbit. Nuclear spins The nuclear spin and magnetic moment of vanadium 50 has been measured in a crystal of K 4 Fe(CN) 6 3 H 2 O containing a few milligrams of vanadium enhanced to contain ~ 20 % 50 V. The spin was found to be six and the ratio of the nuclear gyromagnetic ratios of 50 V/ 51 V, 0. 380, agrees well with the value measured by nuclear resonance of 0. 3792. The spin and nuclear gyromagnetic ratio fit well with the values calculated by Hitchcock (1952) using a <b>j-j</b> spin-orbit <b>coupling</b> model of the nucleus and assuming &delta-function potential. The nuclear spin and magnetic moment of radioactive cobalt 57 have been measured in a crystal of K 2 Zn(SO 4) 2 6 H 2 O containing > 0. 5 μgrams of 57 Co. The crystal also contains some stable 59 Co up to 2. 4 μgrams total cobalt content. Only one set of hyperfine structure lines is resolved so tnat the spin and magnetic moment of 57 Co are tht same as 59 Co; i. e. the spin is 7 / 2 and the magnetic moment is 4. 6 ± 0. 2 nuclear magnetons. Chromic methylamine alum Paramagnetic resonance measurements on crystals of Cr(CH 3 NH 3 (SO 4) 12 H 2 2 O show that the crystals undergo a change in strucure at 157 ± 3 °K. Above this temperature the crystal symmetry is cubic and the Cr +++ ions are in a crystal field which has a small component. Below this temperature there is an additional rhombic componant in the crystal field and the crystal symmetry is lower, probably tetragonal. At both 90 °k and 20 °K the parameters in the spin hamiltonian are g = 1. 975 ± 0. 010, D = 0. 0871 ± 0. 0007 cm - 1 and K = 0. 0092 ± 0. 0008 cm - 1. These values give a stark splitting in zero field of 0. 177 ± 0. 002 cm - 1 which disagrees with the value of 0. 188 ± 0. 007 cm - 1 calculated by Kurti and Gardner (1954) from adiabatic demagnetisation measurements. Measurements at frequencies near the Stark splitting give results which lie between the two values so that it is not possible to say whether this descrepency is real. Measurements of nearest neighbour lines and of line widths indicate that there is extremely little exchange interaction between neighbouring Cr +++ ions. The transition is possibly due to a freezing out of a random rotary motion of the methylamine radical as the substance is cooled through the transition temperature. This temperature is the same as that found by Griffiths and Powell (1952) at which there is a discontinuity in the value of the dielectric constant. Interactions between neighbouring ions The p. r. spectrum of two adjacent consists of a series of lines, corresponding to the various orientations of the spins with respect to one another, which occur as satellites to the iines by isolated ions, the number of acid separation these satellites depends upon the size and nature of the interaction between them. The magnetic interaction may be calculated if the distance between the ions is known, so that if allowance is made for this, the size and nature of exchange interaction may be inferred from the positions of the satellite lines. Investigations of this sort have been done in crystals containing about 10 % paramagnetic salt in an isomorphous diamagnetic one, so that there is considerable chance of having two ions adjacent. A study of lanthanum ethyl sulphate containing up to 30 % neodymium shows that there is a small anisotropic exchange interaction with the two nearest neighbours and undetectable exchange interaction with the six next nearest. There is however no exchange with the next nearest neighbours in concentrated neodymium ethyl sulphate. This discrepancy is not explained. A study of nearest neigbbour satellites was made in KCr(SeO 4) 2 12 H 2 O. the problem is complicated by there being four ions in the unit cell all of which have different crystal field axes. It has not been possible to make an unambiguous interpretation of the results and the best interpretation does not agree with the results of adiabatic demagnetisation experiments of Kurti and Gardner (unpublished). The results of this type of investigation are rather discouraging and seem to indicate that one can hope to obtain satisfactory results only in particular substances. Rare earth ethyl sulphates Paramagnetic resonance has been observed in terbium etbyl sulphate using the yttrium salt as a dilutant. The spectrum may be explained using the hamiltonian postulated for the praseodymium salt (Bleaney and Seovil, 1952) : H = g // βH z S z + AS z I z + AS x where g // = 17. 72 ± 0. 02, S = 1 / 2, I = 3 / 2, A = 0. 209 ± 0. 002 cm - 1 and Δ = 0. 387 ± 0. 001 cm - 1. The lowest level is a doublet J z = ± 6 which is admixed with J x = 0 by the crystal field. This admixes the + 6 and - 6 levels and ΔM = 0 transitions are obtained if the r. f. magnetic field is placed parallel to tbe external field. The nuclear spin of terbium 159 is estimated to be 1. 5 ± 0. 4 nuclear magnetons. The work of Bleaney and Seovil (1952) on praseodymium ethyl sulphate has been extended using yttrium ethyl sulphate as a dilutant. The assymmetrical line shape is explained as being tbe result of the splitting Δ in the above hatmiltonian not having a single value but a Gaussian distribution of values, the nuclear magnetic moment of praseodymium 141 is estimated to be 4. 5 ± 1. 1 nuclear magnetons. </p...|$|R

The effective model is systematically constructed by including the effect of a crystalline electric field (CEF) potential in the perturbation expansion in terms of 1 /λ. In this paper, we collect all the terms up to the first order of 1 /λ. Solving the effective model, we show the results of the CEF states for each case of n= 2 ∼ 5 with O_ h symmetry in comparison with those of the Stevens Hamiltonian for the weak CEF.

I revisit this idea with large-basis, no-core shell model (NCSM) calculations using modern ab initio two-body interactions, and dissect the resulting wavefunctions into their component L- and S-components. Remarkably, there is broad agreement with calculations using the phenomenological Cohen-Kurath forces, despite a gap of nearly fifty years and six orders of magnitude in basis dimensions. I suggest L-S may be {{a useful tool for}} analyzing ab initio wavefunctions of light nuclei, for example in the case of rotational bands. Comment: 14 pages, 14 figure...|$|E
40|$|We discuss Kondo {{phenomena}} in a seven-orbital impurity Anderson model hybridized with Γ_ 8 conduction electrons by employing a numerical renormalization group method. In particular, {{we focus on}} the case with three local f electrons, corresponding to a Nd^ 3 + ion. For realistic values of Coulomb interactions, spin-orbit coupling, cubic crystalline electric field potentials, and hybridization, we find a residual entropy of 0. 5 2, a characteristic of two-channel Kondo phenomena, for the wide range of parameters of the local Γ_ 6 ground state. This is considered to be the magnetic two-channel Kondo effect, consistent with the result from an extended s-d model constructed {{on the basis of the}} <b>j-j</b> <b>coupling</b> scheme. Finally, we briefly discuss candidates of Nd compounds to observe the two-channel Kondo effect. Comment: 4 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{understand}} a crucial role of orbital degree of freedom in the magnetic structure of recently synthesized neptunium compounds NpTGa 5 (T=Fe, Co, and Ni), we propose to discuss the magnetic phase of an effective two-orbital model, which has been constructed based on a <b>j-j</b> <b>coupling</b> scheme to explain the magnetic structure of uranium compounds UTGa 5. By analyzing the model {{with the use of}} numerical technique such as exact diagonalization, we obtain the phase diagram including several kinds of magnetic states. An orbital-based scenario is discussed to understand the change in the magnetic structure among C-, A-, and G-type antiferromagnetic phases, experimentally observed in NpFeGa 5, NpCoGa 5, and NpNiGa 5.

40|$|We {{clarify the}} two-channel Kondo {{effect in the}} seven-orbital Anderson model hybridized with Γ_ 8 {{conduction}} electrons by employing a numerical renormalization group method. From the numerical analysis for the case with two local f electrons, corresponding to Pr^ 3 + or U^ 4 + ion, we confirm that a residual entropy of 0. 5 2, a characteristic of two-channel Kondo phenomena,appears for the local Γ_ 3 non-Kramers doublet state. For further understanding on the Γ_ 3 state, the effective model is constructed {{on the basis of}} a <b>j-j</b> <b>coupling</b> scheme. Then, we rediscover the two-channel s-d model concerning quadrupole degrees of freedom.

40|$|The authors {{study the}} charge and {{magnetic}} form factors appearing in elastic electron scattering by 1 p shell nuclei. The {{question that the}} form factors may be obtained from simple nuclear models by simply introducing a scaling factor has been examined using the <b>j-j</b> <b>coupling,</b> the L-S coupling and the intermediate coupling of Cohen-Kurath (CK) resulting from effective interactions. Results for /sup 6 /Li, /sup 7 /Li, /sup 9 /Be and /sup 13 /C are given and the q/sup 2 / dependences of their form factors are compared in the three models and with experiment. The CK scheme gives similar results to the L-S coupling for /sup 6 /Li and /sup 7 /Li in agreement with experiment, whereas it is intermediate between j-j and L-S couplings in /sup 9 /Be and /sup 13 /C.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{effects of}} multipole moments in f-electron systems both from phenomenological and microscopic viewpoints. First, we discuss significant effects of octupole {{moment on the}} magnetic susceptibility in a paramagnetic phase. It is found that even within mean-field approximation, the magnetic susceptibility deviates from the Curie-Weiss law due to interactions between dipole and octupole moments. Next, we proceed to a microscopic theory for multipole ordering {{on the basis of}} a <b>j-j</b> <b>coupling</b> scheme. After brief explanation of a method to derive multipole interactions from the $f$-electron model, we discuss several multipole ordered phases depending on lattice structure. Finally, we show our new development of the microscopic approach to the evaluation of multipole response functions. We apply fluctuation exchange approximation to the f-electron model, and evaluate multipole response functions. Comment: 7 pages, 4 figures, Proceedings of ASR-WYP- 200...|$|E
40|$|Key role of orbital {{degree of}} freedom to {{understand}} the magnetic structure of uranium compounds is discussed from a microscopic viewpoint by focusing on typical examples such as UMGa_ 5 (M=Ni and Pt) and the mother compound UGa_ 3. By analyzing an orbital degenerate Hubbard model constructed from the <b>j-j</b> <b>coupling</b> scheme in the cubic system, we obtain the phase diagram including several kinds of magnetic states. Especially, in the parameter region corresponding to actual uranium compounds, the phase diagram suggests successive transitions among paramagnetic, magnetic metallic, and insulating Néel states, consistent with the experimental results for AuCu_ 3 -type uranium compounds. Furthermore, taking account of tetragonal effects such as level splitting and reduction of hopping amplitude along the z-axis, an orbital-based scenario is proposed to understand {{the change in the}} magnetic structure from G- to A-type antiferromagnetic phases, experimentally observed in UNiGa_ 5 and UPtGa_ 5.

40|$|To clarify a {{key role}} of f orbitals in the {{emergence}} of antiferro-quadrupole structure in PrPb_ 3, we investigate the ground-state property of an orbital-degenerate Kondo lattice model by numerical diagonalization techniques. In PrPb_ 3, Pr^ 3 + has a 4 f^ 2 configuration and the crystalline-electric-field ground state is a non-Kramers doublet Γ_ 3. In a <b>j-j</b> <b>coupling</b> scheme, the Γ_ 3 state is described by two local singlets, each of which consists of two f electrons with one in Γ_ 7 and another in Γ_ 8 orbitals. Since in a cubic structure, Γ_ 7 has localized nature, while Γ_ 8 orbitals are rather itinerant, we propose the orbital-degenerate Kondo lattice model for an effective Hamiltonian of PrPb_ 3. We show that an antiferro-orbital state is favored by the so-called double-exchange mechanism which is characteristic of multi-orbital systems.

40|$|We {{investigate}} microscopic {{aspects of}} multipole ordering in f-electron systems {{with emphasis on}} the effect of lattice structure. For the purpose, first we construct f-electron models on three kinds of lattices, simple cubic (sc), bcc, and fcc, by including f-electron hopping through (ffσ) bonding in a tight-binding approximation {{on the basis of a}} <b>j-j</b> <b>coupling</b> scheme. Then, an effective model is derived in the strong-coupling limit for each lattice structure with the use of second-order perturbation theory with respect to (ffσ). By applying mean-field theory to such effective models, we find different types of multipole ordered state depending on the lattice structure. For the sc lattice, a Γ_ 3 g antiferro-quadrupole transition occurs at a finite temperature and as further lowering temperature, we find another transition to a ferromagnetic state. For the bcc lattice, a Γ_ 2 u antiferro-octupole ordering occurs first, and then, a ferromagnetic phase transition follows it. Finally, for the fcc lattice, we find a single phase transition to the longitudinal triple-q Γ_ 5 u octupole ordering. Comment: 13 pages, 10 figure...|$|E
40|$|By using a density matrix {{renormalization}} group method, {{we investigate}} the ground-state properties of a one-dimensional three-orbital Hubbard model {{on the basis}} of a <b>j-j</b> <b>coupling</b> scheme. For B_ 4 ^ 0 0, where B_ 4 ^ 0 is a parameter to control cubic crystalline electric field effect, one orbital is itinerant, while other two are localized. Due to the competition between itinerant and localized natures, we obtain orbital ordering pattern which is sensitive to B_ 4 ^ 0, leading to a characteristic change of Γ_ 3 g quadrupole state into an incommensurate structure. At B_ 4 ^ 0 = 0, all the three orbitals are degenerate, but we observe a peak at q = 0 in Γ_ 3 g quadrupole correlation, indicating a ferro-orbital state, and the peak at q = π in Γ_ 4 u dipole correlation, suggesting an antiferromagnetic state. We also discuss the effect of Γ_ 4 u octupole on magnetic anisotropy. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figures, Proceedings of ASR-WYP- 2005 (September 27 - 29, 2005, Tokai...|$|E

The operators in the present representation, which is most naturally {{expressed in terms of}} spherical notation and angular momentum eigenfunctions are explicitly related to those which appeared in the older notation as cartesian tensor components. The results for both one- and two-nucleon configurations are expressed in terms of reduced matrix elements which, in turn, can be written in terms of Racah coefficients and other coefficients derived from them. All these coefficients, and thereby the reduced matrix elements, can be written in terms of comparatively simple algebraic formulas which cover all cases of interest.
