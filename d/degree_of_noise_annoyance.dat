40|$|Abstract: This {{cross-sectional}} study investigated noise annoyance, awareness and practice among {{the workers in}} two steel factories in UAE. The study involving 468 steel workers randomly selected. Noise exposure was estimated using the integrated sound level meter. A structured interview questionnaire {{was used to assess}} the noise annoyance, awareness and practice of workers towards the noise. The results showed that about 89 % of the workers exposed to a daily Leq above the permissible level which is 85 dB (A) and 45 % of them had never used any hearing protection devices. About 58 % of the workers experienced a moderate or high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance.</b> Only 4. 1 % and 1. 9 % of the workers aware about the health effects of noise and the methods of prevention respectively and awareness was positively associated with noise exposure. Few workers (13. 2 %) used the hearing protection devices during the working time. Thus workers within both factories are at high risk of developing noise annoyance, and other related ailments due to excessive occupational expo-sure to noise, and non-use of hearing protection devices. There was an association between noise annoyance and noise level and any one of them could influence the workers to use the hearing protection devices. There is a need to have a hearing conservation program in both factories one of its main components is education to raise the awareness of workers about noise hazards and methods of prevention. Finally, the factor noise annoyance should be incorporated into all future studies on the use of hearing protection devices...|$|E
40|$|Context: Noise of {{machines}} in various agro-based industries {{was found to}} be the major occupational hazard for the workers of industries. The predominant noise sources need to be identified and the causes of high noise need to be studied to undertake the appropriate measures to reduce the noise level in one of the major agro-based industries, oil mills. Aims: To identify the predominant noise sources in the workrooms of oil mills. To study the causes of noise in oil mills. To measure the extent of noise exposure of oil mill workers. To examine the response of workers towards noise, so that appropriate measures can be undertaken to minimize the noise exposure. Settings and Design: A noise survey was conducted in the three renowned oil mills of north-eastern region of India. Materials and Methods: Information like output capacity, size of power source, maintenance condition of the machines and workroom configurations of the oil mills was collected by personal observations and enquiry with the owner of the mill. Using a Sound Level Meter (SLM) (Model- 824, Larson and Davis, USA), equivalent SPL was measured at operator&#x 2032;s ear level in the working zone of the workers near each machine of the mills. In order to study the variation of SPL in the workrooms of the oil mill throughout its operation, equivalent SPL was measured at two appropriate locations of working zone of the workers in each mill. For conducting the noise survey, the guidelines of Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety (CCOHS) were followed. Grid points were marked {{on the floor of the}} workroom of the oil mill at a spacing of 1 m x 1 m. SPL at grid points were measured at about 1. 5 m above the floor. The direction of the SLM was towards the nearby noisy source. To increase accuracy, two replications were taken at each grid point. All the data were recorded for 30 sec. At the end of the experiment, data were downloaded to a personal computer. With the help of utility software of Larson and Davis, USA, equivalent SPL and noise spectrum at each reading was obtained. Noise survey map of equivalent SPL was drawn for each oil mill by drawing contour lines on the sketch of the oil mill between the points of equal SPL. The floor area in the oil mill where SPL exceeded 85 dBA was identified from the noise survey map of each oil mill to determine the causes of high level of noise. Subjective assessment was done during the rest period of workers and it was assessed with personal interview with each worker separately. Demographic information, nature of work, working hours, rest period, experience of working in the mill, <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance,</b> activity interference, and psychological and physiological effects of machine noise on the worker were asked during the interview. These details were noted in a structured form. Statistical Analysis Used: Nil. Results: The noise survey conducted in three renowned oil mills of north-eastern region of India revealed that about 26 &#x 0025; of the total workers were exposed to noise level of more than 85 dBA. Further, 10 &#x 0025; to 30 &#x 0025; floor areas of workrooms, where oil expellers are provided have the SPL of more than 85 dBA. The noise in the oil mills was dominated by low frequency noise. The predominant noise sources in the oil mills were seed cleaner and power transmission system to oil expellers. Poor maintenance {{of machines}} and use of bamboo stick to prevent the fall of belt from misaligned pulleys were the main reason of high noise. Noise emitted by the electric motor, table ghani and oil expellers in all the oil mills was well within 85 dBA. Subjective response indicated that about 63 &#x 0025; of the total workers felt that noise interfered with their conversation. About 16 &#x 0025; each were of the opinion that noise interfered in their work and harmed their hearing. About 5 &#x 0025; of workers stated that the workroom noise gave them headaches. Conclusions: The workers engaged in the workrooms of the oil mills are exposed to high noise, which will have detrimental effect on their health. The poor maintenance of drive system {{was found to be}} the main reason for high noise level...|$|E

Depression and anxiety increased with the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> overall <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance.</b> Compared to no annoyance, prevalence ratios for depression, respectively anxiety increased from moderate (PR depression 1. 20; 95 %CI 1. 00 to 1. 45; PR anxiety 1. 42; 95 % CI 1. 15 to 1. 74) to extreme annoyance (PR depression 1. 97; 95 %CI 1. 62 to 2. 39; PR anxiety 2. 14; 95 % CI 1. 71 to 2. 67). Compared to other sources, aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> was prominent affecting almost 60 % of the population.

40|$|Unfairness {{increases}} <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> <b>Noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> increases due to unfair sound management. Fair sound management reduces annoyance, however {{only when}} the sound pressure level is high, concludes Eveline Maris based on two laboratory experiments. Being exposed to man-made sound is more than mere exposure: it is a social experience, too: You expose Me. This social hypothesis <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> has been confirmed in two laboratory experiments. Participants were exposed to aircraft noise (sound pressure level (SPL) : 50 or 70 dB A) and treated either in a neutral, fair, or unfair manner. The results show that besides SPL, also {{the fairness of the}} procedure determines the level <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance.</b> The first experiment shows an interaction effect of procedural fairness and SPL: annoyance ratings are significantly lower in the fair than in the neutral condition, but the effect is found only when SPL is 70 dB. The second experiment shows a main effect of procedural unfairness on <b>noise</b> annoyance: <b>annoyance</b> ratings are significantly higher in the unfair than in the neutral conditions, regardless of SPL.

After an introduction to different concepts and definitions <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> different scales <b>of</b> how <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> can be measured are shown. The question is discussed whether disturbance effects <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> at different times of day are given.

40|$|Aims The aims of {{this thesis}} were to {{describe}} and {{gain an understanding of}} how {{people who live in the}} vicinity of wind turbines are affected by wind turbine noise, and how individual, situational and visual factors, as well as sound properties, moderate the response. Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out in a flat, mainly rural area in Sweden, with the objective to estimate the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> and to examine the dose-response relationship between A-weighted sound pressure levels (SPLs) and perception of and annoyance with wind turbine noise. Subjective responses were obtained through a questionnaire (n = 513; response rate: 68 %) and outdoor, A-weighted SPLs were calculated for each respondent. To gain a deeper understanding <b>of</b> the observed <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance,</b> 15 people living in an area were interviewed using open-ended questions. The interviews were analysed using the comparative method of Grounded Theory (GT). An additional cross-sectional study, mainly exploring the influence of individual and situational factors, was carried out in seven areas in Sweden that differed with regard to terrain (flat or complex) and <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> urbanization (n = 765; response rate: 58 %). To further explore the impact of visual factors, data from the two cross-sectional studies were tested with structural equation modelling. A proposed model of the influence of visual attitude on <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance,</b> also comprising the influence <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> level and general attitude, was tested among respondents who could see wind turbines versus respondents who could not see wind turbines from their dwelling, and respondents living in flat versus complex terrain. Results Dose-response relationships were found both for perception <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> and for <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> in relation to A-weighted SPLs. The risk of annoyance was enhanced among respondents who could see at least one turbine from their dwelling and among those living in a rural in comparison with a suburban area. Noise from wind turbines was appraised as an intrusion of privacy among people who expected quiet and peace in their living environment. Negative experiences that led to feelings of inferiority added to the distress. Sound characteristics describing the amplitude modulated aerodynamic sound were appraised as the most annoying (swishing, whistling and pulsating/throbbing). Wind turbines were judged as environmentally friendly, efficient and necessary, but also as ugly and unnatural. Being negative towards the visual impact of the wind turbines on the landscape scenery, rather than towards wind turbines as such, was strongly associated with annoyance. Self-reported health impairment was not correlated to SPL, while decreased well-being was associated with <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance.</b> Indications <b>of</b> possible hindrance to psycho-physiological restoration were observed. Conclusions Wind turbine noise is easily perceived and is annoying even at low A-weighted SPLs. This could be due to perceived incongruence between the characteristics <b>of</b> wind turbine <b>noise</b> and the background sound. Wind turbines are furthermore prominent objects whose rotational movement attracts the eye. Multimodal sensory effects or negative aesthetic response could enhance the risk <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance.</b> Adverse reactions could possibly lead to stress-related symptoms due to prolonged physiological arousal and hindrance to psychophysiological restoration. The observed differences in prevalence <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> between living environments make it necessary to assess separate dose-response relationships for different types of landscapes...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} clarify the {{community}} response to road traffic noise in living environments. Social surveys were carried out for the inhabitants along trunk roads in the Kanagawa prefecture, Japan. After the collection <b>of</b> the questionnaires, <b>noise</b> and vibration exposures were estimated. In this paper, the authors focused on individual differences caused by that inhabitants giving weight to different factors in living environments. Respondents were classified into four groups based on individual differences. Through the comparison of dose-response relationships and path analysis, it was verified that the structure <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> was different among these groups...|$|R
40|$|Construction {{activities}} generate {{construction noise}} may cause <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> {{among the public}} residents. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> level due to the sound pressure levels and the distances from the construction sites. Three public resident areas around Johor which located near to the construction sites have been selected. Two important indicators such as sound pressure levels and distances between the receiver and the noise sources were measured. 42 questionnaires were randomly distributed to the public residents who live near to the construction sites. The results showed that all respondent have different annoyance levels due to the construction noise. The sound pressure levels received by the public residents are increasing with the decreasing of the distance between the receiver and the noise sources. Thus, the relationship <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> levels is directly proportional to the sound pressure levels produced from construction sites. Meanwhile, the <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> levels are decreasing with the increasing of the distances. As a conclusion, the public residents who live nearer to the construction sites suffered from a high <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> level as expected...|$|R
40|$|Exposure to road-traffic <b>noise</b> {{commonly}} engenders <b>annoyance,</b> {{the extent}} of which is determined by factors not fully understood. Our aim was to estimate the prevalence and determinants <b>of</b> road-traffic <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> and <b>noise</b> sensitivity in the Finnish adult population, while comparing the perceptions <b>of</b> road-traffic <b>noise</b> to exhausts as environmental health problems. Using a questionnaire that yielded responses from 1112 randomly selected adult Finnish respondents, we estimated road-traffic noise- and exhausts-related perceived exposures, health-risk perceptions, and self-reported annoyance on five-point scales, while noise sensitivity estimates were based on four questions. Determinants <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> and sensitivity were investigated using multivariate binary logistic regression and linear regression models, respectively. High or extreme <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> was reported by 17 % <b>of</b> respondents. <b>Noise</b> sensitivity scores approximated a Gaussian distribution. Road-traffic noise and exhausts were, respectively, considered high or extreme population-health risks by 22 % and 27 % of respondents. Knowledge of health risks from traffic noise, OR: 2. 04 (1. 09 – 3. 82) and noise sensitivity, OR: 1. 07 (1. 00 – 1. 14) were positively associated with annoyance. Knowledge of health risks (p < 0. 045) and positive environmental attitudes (p < 000) were associated with higher noise sensitivity. Age and sex were associated with annoyance and sensitivity only in bivariate models. A considerable proportion of Finnish adults are highly annoyed by road-traffic noise, and perceive {{it to be a}} significant health risk, almost comparable to traffic exhausts. There is no distinct noise-sensitive population subgroup. Knowledge of health risks <b>of</b> road-traffic <b>noise,</b> and attitudinal variables are associated with <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> and sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{methodology}} {{is presented}} for the simultaneous measurement <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> and personal <b>annoyance</b> {{at the exact}} times that the affected person is annoyed. The system is described and applied to a test case, a farmhouse close to a wind farm where the resident claims to be annoyed by noise. The system was successfully able to characterise the level and spectral content <b>of</b> the <b>noise</b> in the house when the resident was annoyed, {{and there was some}} correlation with personally recorded annoyance level. As the system cannot identify noise sources, no conclusions can be made about noise source; however, the methodology is shown to be a useful aid for diagnosing the type and severity <b>of</b> an indoor <b>noise</b> problem. To help interpret the results from this type of testing, a discussion concerning the subjective nature <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> is presented before some suggestions are made for further improvements in the measurement system.

40|$|This {{presents}} social surveys {{on community}} responses to road traffic noise that {{were carried out}} by telephone in Sapporo and Kumamoto, which have different climates. The dose-response relationships for general annoyance and interference with activities showed no systematic differences between the cities. Applying path analysis to the response and noise data revealed similar annoyance profiles. However, the effect of disturbed TV/radio listening on annoyance was stronger in Kumamoto, which is probably {{a result of the}} custom there of spending {{a great deal of time}} in well air-conditioned rooms in this hot area. A scheme for the abatement <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> <b>annoyance</b> is also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Firstly, {{criteria}} for designing response scales and selecting verbal scale point labels for annoyance scales are discussed.

Virtually all studies, whether lab experiments or population surveys, employ scales to measure this construct. Two main types of annoyance scales are: direct scaling, i. e., the respondent expresses her/his <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> annoyance (or disturbance, apprehension, irritation etc) on an accordingly anchored and labeled scale; and scaling via statements, i. e., the respondent assesses to which extent s/he experiences particular described noise effects (usually as intensity or frequency).
