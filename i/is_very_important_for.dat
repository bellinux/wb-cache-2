5|$|A base such as spermine {{has a few}} {{different}} {{sites where}} protonation can occur. In this example the first proton can go on the terminal –NH2 group, or either of the internal –NH– groups. The pKa values for dissociation of spermine protonated at one or other of the sites are examples of micro-constants. They cannot be determined directly by means of pH, absorbance, fluorescence or NMR measurements. Nevertheless, the site of protonation <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> biological function, so mathematical methods {{have been developed for}} the determination of micro-constants.C NMR Data Processed by the New Computer Program HypNMR2000.

25|$|A {{standard}} tandem cell {{consists of}} one n-DSC and one p-DSC {{in a simple}} sandwich configuration with an intermediate electrolyte layer. n-DSC and p-DSC are connected in series, which implies that the resulting photocurrent will be controlled by the weakest photoelectrode, whereas photovoltages are additive. Thus, photocurrent matching <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> the construction of highly efficient tandem pn-DSCs. However, unlike n-DSCs, fast charge recombination following dye-sensitized hole injection usually resulted in low photocurrents in p-DSC and thus hampered {{the efficiency of the}} overall device.|$|E
25|$|The {{languages}} of this class have great practical importance {{in computer science}} {{as they can be}} parsed much more efficiently than nondeterministic context-free languages. The complexity of the program and execution time of a deterministic pushdown automaton is vastly less than that of a nondeterministic one. In the naive implementation, the latter must make copies of the stack every time a nondeterministic step occurs. The best known algorithm to test membership in any context-free language is Valiant's algorithm, taking O(n2.378) time, where n is the length of the string. On the other hand, deterministic context-free languages can be accepted in O(n) time by an LR(k) parser. This <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> computer language translation because many computer languages belong to this class of languages.|$|E
