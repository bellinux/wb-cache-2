25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the British Railways Board made the {{decision}} to replace its main-line express <b>diesel</b> <b>traction.</b> Financial limitations were tight, so mass electrification was not possible. As a result, a new generation of high-speed diesel trains had to be developed.|$|E

50|$|Class 270 (later {{reclassified}} as Class 70) locomotives {{were the}} first diesel shunters used by NMBS/SNCB. Three were initially ordered as prototypes of <b>Diesel</b> Electric <b>traction.</b> Three Diesel-Hydraulic Class 271 locomotives were also ordered for comparison.|$|R
25|$|East Anglia {{was one of}} {{the first}} areas in the UK where British Railways wanted to phase out steam {{operation}} in favour of <b>diesel</b> <b>traction.</b> From 1959 diesels started to take over operation of services with Cambridge engine shed closing to steam in 1962. Diesel shunters and DMUs were allocated to another shed on the opposite side of the line known as Coldham Lane.|$|E
25|$|The {{engine is}} an 8-{{cylinder}}, 145 litre Mirrlees Blackstone 8MB275T <b>diesel</b> <b>traction</b> engine (275mm cylinder diameter); the Mirrlees engine {{was one of}} the most fuel efficient available at the time (189g of fuel per kWhr), but relatively heavy. The engine was also successfully installed in marine applications such as small ships and passenger ferries. The low cylinder count for the rated power was expected to result in lower maintenance costs.|$|E
25|$|In many railway {{stations}} and industrial compounds, steam shunters {{had to be}} kept hot during lots of breaks between scattered short tasks. Therefore, <b>diesel</b> <b>traction</b> became economical for shunting before it became economical for hauling trains. The construction of diesel shunters began in 1920 in France, in 1925 in Denmark, in 1926 in the Netherlands, and in 1927 in Germany. After few years of testing, hundreds of units were produced within a decade.|$|E
5000|$|Hermann Lemp born: Heinrich Joseph Hermann Lemp (August 8, 1862 [...] - [...] March 31, 1954) was a Swiss-American {{electrical}} engineer; he {{is credited}} as {{the inventor of}} the modern system of <b>diesel</b> electric <b>traction</b> co-ordination and control.|$|R
25|$|By the 21st century, for <b>diesel</b> {{locomotive}} <b>traction</b> worldwide {{the majority}} of countries used diesel–electric designs, with diesel hydraulic designs not found in use outside Germany and Japan, and some neighbouring states, where it is used in designs for freight work.|$|R
50|$|Cardiff Canton TMD is a <b>diesel</b> {{locomotive}} <b>Traction</b> Maintenance Depot in Cardiff, Wales. Its depot code is CF. It {{is operated}} by Arriva Trains Wales. The depot {{is used by}} Arriva Trains Wales fleet and some Cross Country class 170s.|$|R
25|$|Simultaneously {{with the}} ICE 3, Siemens {{developed}} trains with tilting technology, using {{much of the}} ICE 3 technical design. The class 411 (seven cars) and 415 (five cars) ICE T EMUs and class 605 ICE TD DMUs (four cars) were built with a similar interior and exterior design. They were specially designed for older railway lines not suitable for high speeds, for example the twisting lines in Thuringia. ICE-TD has <b>diesel</b> <b>traction.</b> ICE-T and ICE-TD can be operated jointly, {{but this is not}} done routinely.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the December 2013 {{timetable}} change, a two-hourly service operated to {{and from}} Edinburgh Waverley/Glasgow Central (alternating), but these Scottish services on this route now run via Wigan North Western and the newly electrified line over Chat Moss. A small number of Scottish peak services still operated via Bolton/Wigan North Western and Bolton/Chorley using <b>diesel</b> <b>traction</b> until December 2014. There was also a single service {{to and from}} Glasgow operated by Virgin Trains in the 2007–08 timetable, but this ended in December 2008.|$|E
25|$|After the {{decision}} to switch to <b>diesel</b> <b>traction,</b> the site was completely rebuilt in 1962 to accommodate diesels, including the Warship Class that were used on the Exeter to Waterloo services. The Factory was reformed to provide four roads with servicing pits and cab level platforms, providing facilities to repair eight locomotives at the same time. Access was via the existing traversing table. A daily servicing and fuelling point was built beside the old steam shed {{and it was this}} which provided the main facility after the factory closed in 1970.|$|E

50|$|Longsight Diesel TMD is {{a railway}} <b>diesel</b> {{locomotive}} <b>traction</b> maintenance depot (TMD) situated in Longsight, Manchester, England. The depot code is LO. The depot is located 1+1/2 mi south of Manchester Piccadilly {{on the eastern}} side of the line to Stockport. There are various roads in which individual train sets can be overhauled.|$|R
2500|$|As the VR {{focussed}} {{its attention}} on <b>diesel</b> electric <b>traction,</b> steam locomotive depots were gradually closed {{down and the}} remaining steam fleet became a much lower maintenance priority. [...] A particular problem {{was the lack of}} feedwater treatment, which saw many R class locomotive boilers condemned for severe corrosion well before the end of their design life.|$|R
25|$|Part of the Contract with BRCW stipulated that, {{in view of}} its 42 {{years of}} {{experience}} in loco design, Sulzer were to accept full responsibility for the design and performance of the completed loco (6). The CR had knowledge of Sulzer since the appointment of Deane as its Engineer in Chief of Construction of the Trans-Australian line. Deane had proposed {{in the early days of}} the TAR that dieselisation was the way to go, and had considered early Sulzer designs then. (Some have suggested that the CR worked with the South Australian Railways to trial <b>diesel</b> <b>traction).,</b> However, the technology was not developed enough to be reliable. Deane was a generation ahead of his time.|$|E
25|$|As the Røros Line lacks electrification, all trains {{operating}} on the line use <b>diesel</b> <b>traction.</b> This means that both express passenger and freight trains between Oslo and Trondheim use the Dovre Line. The main use of the Røros Line are regional passenger trains, operated using Class 92 and Class 93 diesel multiple units operated by the Norwegian State Railways. As of 2015 there are two through trains which run from Trondheim to Hamar, with a travel time of 6 hours. There is one additional train which runs once between Trondheim and Røros, taking 2 hours and 30 minutes, and four trains which run between Røros and Hamar, taking 3 hours and 20 minutes. Large parts of the day there are therefore a two-hour headway between Hamar and Røros.|$|E
25|$|As with {{a number}} of other {{prominent}} independent schools in the South of England, a locomotive of the Southern Railway V Class was named after Winchester College. The second locomotive of the class, No. 901 Winchester was, like the other 39 V Class engines, constructed by the Southern at Eastleigh Works, not far away from the city of Winchester itself, and entered service in 1930. Winchester was one of those examples of the class selected by the railway's new chief mechanical engineer Oliver Bulleid for rebuilding with a Lemaître multiple-jet blastpipe and wide-diameter chimney from 1939 onwards. Upon passing into British Railways ownership due to the nationalisation of the railways in 1948, as an ex-SR machine Winchester was accordingly renumbered 30901. Like many members of the class, during 1962 No. 30901 was viewed as surplus to requirements, largely due to both increasing use of <b>diesel</b> <b>traction</b> and an expansion of the third-rail electrified network across former Southern Railway territory, and withdrawn from service.|$|E
50|$|Engineering {{works on}} other routes between Glasgow and Edinburgh {{may result in}} other <b>diesel</b> hauled {{passenger}} <b>traction</b> being seen, but these almost never call at this station.|$|R
25|$|The Victorian Railways L {{class was}} {{a class of}} {{mainline}} electric locomotive that ran on Australia's Victorian Railways and its successor V/Line from 1953 until 1987. Introduced {{in conjunction with the}} electrification of the Gippsland line, these locomotives hauled both passenger and freight services between Traralgon and Melbourne until the overhead electrification was decommissioned in favour of <b>diesel</b> electric <b>traction.</b>|$|R
50|$|Railways in the Republic were {{converted}} to <b>diesel</b> locomotive <b>traction</b> early, and swiftly, due to the run down nature {{of many of the}} steam engines, lack of coal, and a desire for modernisation. In 1951 CIÉ's first diesel railcars arrived, followed in 1953 by an order for 100 diesel locomotives. A full list of CIÉ diesel locomotives can be found here.|$|R
25|$|Objections {{were made}} against the closure, notably from the Kent County Council and Strood Rural District Council which {{challenged}} BR's method of calculating passenger numbers and losses. They {{argued that the}} figures (i) failed to consider cheaper methods of running the line such as using <b>diesel</b> <b>traction</b> units, closing minor halts, eliminating unnecessary journeys, the operation of direct summer excursions from London to Allhallows and the combination of passenger and goods services, (ii) took into account costs incurred for the line between Gravesend and Grain which would remain open for freight, (iii) included a figure of £5,000 which would be paid to Maidstone & District Motor Services for replacement bus services, (iv) failed {{to take into account}} holiday traffic - 2,812 passengers having used Allhallows on the Whitsun holiday of 3/6 June 1960, and (v) failed to record the 25% increase in passenger numbers or take into account the ongoing residential development in the area.|$|E
500|$|In 1952 a {{new plan}} was {{launched}} by parliament to electrify [...] of railway, with the line from Voss to Hønefoss prioritized fourth. The following year NSB launched the [...] "away with the steam"-campaign, that would replace all steam locomotives with electric or <b>diesel</b> <b>traction.</b> Since electrification was not imminent, NSB introduced <b>diesel</b> <b>traction</b> on the Bergen Line in 1958, predominantly using Di 3 stock. Travel time between the two termini was reduced by about one hour. During summer the Class 66 diesel multiple units were put into service, {{but they were not}} heavy enough to cope with winter and thus only served during the summer months. The line was electrified in four stages, from Roa to Hønefoss on 1 February 1961, from Hønefoss to Ål on 1 December 1962, from Ål to Ustaoset on 15 December 1963 and finally from Ustaoset to Voss on 7 December 1964. As the point of electrification moved across the mountain, so did the point NSB changed locomotive on the train. The new locomotive El 13 was put into service on the electric parts. The electrification cost NOK 143 million.|$|E
500|$|The 1955 Modernisation Plan, known {{formally}} as the [...] "Modernisation and Re-Equipment of the British Railways", {{was published}} in December 1954. With the aim of increasing speed and reliability steam trains were replaced with electric and <b>diesel</b> <b>traction.</b> From 1954 Diesel Multiple Units took over passenger services in the north east except those on the ECML, and {{were introduced to the}} line over Stainmore in February 1958. The passenger service was withdrawn between Barnard Castle and Penrith on 20 January 1962, and between Bishop Auckland and Barnard Castle on 12 June 1962.|$|E
50|$|Slugs {{can be built}} new or {{converted}} from existing locomotives. Conversion has enjoyed popularity {{as a way to}} reuse otherwise obsolete locomotives, especially those with worn-out <b>diesels</b> and good <b>traction</b> motors.|$|R
50|$|The class {{represents}} the final major {{revision of the}} DB V 160 family of locomotives; having the preferred features of the antecedent locomotives, including a hydrodynamic brake, and a single engine providing electrical train heating via a generator as well as tractive power. The class were also the most numerous of the family, providing {{the backbone of the}} Deutsche Bundesbahn's main-line <b>diesel</b> locomotive <b>traction</b> from the 1970s up to the reunification of Germany.|$|R
50|$|Besides {{the dead}} man's switch, the {{electrification}} and dieselisation of railways also helped reduce the required {{staff in the}} locomotive to a sole driver - as <b>diesel</b> and electric <b>traction</b> {{does not require a}} fireman to shovel coal into a boiler.|$|R
500|$|The Class 47 history {{begins in}} the early 1960s with the stated aim of the British Transport Commission (BTC) to {{completely}} remove steam locomotives from British Rail by a target date of 1968. They therefore required a large build of lightweight Type 4 locomotives to achieve this aim. [...] This required locomotives producing at least [...] but with an axle load {{of no more than}} [...] [...] However, the BTC were not convinced that the future of <b>diesel</b> <b>traction</b> lay down the hydraulic transmission path of the Western Region, and began looking at various diesel-electric designs.|$|E
500|$|The 1955 Modernisation Plan, known {{formally}} as the [...] "Modernisation and Re-Equipment of the British Railways", {{was published}} in December 1954, and {{with the aim of}} increasing speed and reliability the steam trains were replaced with electric and <b>diesel</b> <b>traction.</b> In 1958 a battery-electric railcar was introduced on the Deeside Line and a diesel railbus on the Speyside Section. Diesel Multiple Units (DMU) took over services to Peterhead and Fraserburgh in 1959 and from 1960 cross-country types were used on an accelerated Aberdeen to Inverness service that allowed [...] hours for four stops. By 1961 the only service still using steam locomotives was the branch from Tillynaught to Banff.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the {{publishing}} of the Modernisation Plan advocating the change-over to <b>diesel</b> <b>traction,</b> {{there was a}} proposal to construct a second batch of the Clan Class, which was accepted as Crewe Works Order Lot 242. This authorised {{the construction of a}} further batch of fifteen Clans that included modifications to the original design. [...] Originally scheduled for 1952 with frames constructed for 72010 Hengist, acute steel shortages meant that the order was continually rescheduled until the publication of the British Railways Modernisation Plan finally halted the project. The initial name allocations for the new batch would seem to suggest several operating the Kent coast trains, hauling the Golden Arrow and other expresses, so that some of this batch would have been allocated to the Southern Region.|$|E
50|$|The NSW TrainLink {{fleet of}} trains serves the areas outside Sydney, Australia, mainly {{interurban}} and interstate lines. The NSW TrainLink fleet consists of both <b>diesel</b> and electric <b>traction,</b> with {{the oldest of}} the fleet being the V sets and the youngest being the H sets.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} period of British Railways, steam {{locomotion}} {{had continued to}} be of prime importance. Apart from a growing selection of diesel shunters, there had been almost no development of mainline <b>diesel</b> or electric <b>traction</b> beyond the few locomotives ordered by the 'Big Four' companies.|$|R
