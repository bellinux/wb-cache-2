5|$|Bloody Fun Days {{theme was}} {{inspired}} by the short story Everything Can Be Beaten by Jhonen Vasquez. The story centres on a monster called It, who spends his life <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>confines</b> <b>of</b> a single room, waiting in front of a chute that kittens slide down. He crushes the kittens with a hammer. One day It decides to leave the room, and encounters a world full of 'cute' animals. It responds by crushing the creatures, the only thing he is capable of doing.|$|E

In Balabushka's case, his entire workshop consisted of a single lathe and other woodworking equipment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>confines</b> <b>of</b> his modest garage, and building his own full-splice butts would have been prohibitively difficult and expensive for him.|$|E
5|$|Discovery {{departed}} London on 31 July 1901, {{arriving at}} the Antarctic coast, via Cape Town and New Zealand, on 8 January 1902. After landing, Shackleton took part in an experimental balloon flight on 4 February. He also participated, with the scientists Edward Wilson and Hartley Ferrar, in the first sledging trip from the expedition's winter quarters in McMurdo Sound, a journey which established a safe route on to the Great Ice Barrier. During the Antarctic winter of 1902, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>confines</b> <b>of</b> the iced-in Discovery, Shackleton edited the expedition's magazine The South Polar Times.|$|E
60|$|But {{the truth}} of this Proposition will farther appear by observing, that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Superficies interceding two {{transparent}} Mediums, (such as are Air, Water, Oil, common Glass, Crystal, metalline Glasses, Island Glasses, white transparent Arsenick, Diamonds, &c.) the Reflexion is stronger or weaker accordingly, as the Superficies hath a greater or less refracting Power. For <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Confine</b> <b>of</b> Air and Sal-gem 'tis stronger than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Confine</b> <b>of</b> Air and Water, and still stronger <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Confine</b> <b>of</b> Air and common Glass or Crystal, and stronger <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Confine</b> <b>of</b> Air and a Diamond. If any of these, and such like transparent Solids, be immerged in Water, its Reflexion becomes, much weaker than before; and still weaker if they be immerged <b>in</b> <b>the</b> more strongly refracting Liquors of well rectified Oil of Vitriol or Spirit of Turpentine. If Water be distinguish'd into two parts by any imaginary Surface, <b>the</b> Reflexion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Confine</b> <b>of</b> those two parts is none at all. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Confine</b> <b>of</b> Water and Ice 'tis very little; in that of Water and Oil 'tis something greater; in that of Water and Sal-gem still greater; and in that of Water and Glass, or Crystal or other denser Substances still greater, accordingly as those Mediums differ more or less in their refracting Powers. Hence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Confine</b> <b>of</b> common Glass and Crystal, {{there ought to be a}} weak Reflexion, and a stronger Reflexion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Confine</b> <b>of</b> common and metalline Glass; though I have not yet tried this. But <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Confine</b> <b>of</b> two Glasses of equal density, there is not any sensible Reflexion; as was shewn <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first Observation. And the same may be understood of the Superficies interceding two Crystals, or two Liquors, or any other Substances in which no Refraction is caused. So then the reason why uniform pellucid Mediums (such as Water, Glass, or Crystal,) have no sensible Reflexion but in their external Superficies, where they are adjacent to other Mediums of a different density, is because all their contiguous parts have one and the same degree of density.|$|R

5|$|In {{his role}} as Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, Cunningham had to {{negotiate}} with the French Admiral Rene-Emile Godfroy for the demilitarisation and internment of a French squadron at Alexandria, in June 1940, following the Fall of France. Churchill had ordered Cunningham to prevent the French warships from leaving port, and to ensure that French warships did not pass into enemy hands. Stationed at the time at Alexandria, Cunningham entered into delicate negotiations with Godfroy to ensure his fleet, which consisted of the battleship Lorraine, four cruisers, three destroyers and a submarine, posed no threat. The Admiralty ordered Cunningham to complete the negotiations on 3 July. Just as an agreement seemed imminent Godfroy heard of the British action against the French at Mers el Kebir and, for a while, Cunningham feared a battle between French and British warships <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>confines</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria harbour. The deadline was overrun but negotiations ended well, after Cunningham put them on a more personal level and had the British ships appeal to their French opposite numbers. Cunningham's negotiations succeeded and the French emptied their fuel bunkers and removed the firing mechanisms from their guns. Cunningham in turn promised to repatriate the ships' crews.|$|E

Complaints from local residents started immediately after the service commenced and were such that the Board of Trade imposed a speed limit until modifications could be made. This was achieved by only using series mode on the controller, but by 1901, three of the locomotives had been rebuilt with new bogies and nose-suspended GE55 motors, reducing the unsprung weight to 11 tons.|$|E

25|$|The first {{specialized}} anti-tank weaponry {{consisted of}} anti-tank rifles. These {{emerged from the}} mixed results of deploying field artillery against tanks during World War I, {{and the need to}} produce a more economical weapon to destroy them. Most anti-tank rifles were over 1.3m in length, however, and difficult for infantrymen to operate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>confines</b> <b>of</b> their trenches. They could penetrate a tank's armor at long range, but without explosive firepower, often failed to cause catastrophic damage, kill or even seriously injure the crew, or disable the tank. A number of infantry support guns designed to defeat hard targets such as fortified machine gun emplacements were used as makeshift anti-tank weapons, including the French Canon d'Infanterie de 37 modèle 1916 TRP; however, the first true anti-tank gun did not appear until 1928. This was the 3.7 cm Pak 36. Weighing some 160kg, the Pak 36 could inflict a catastrophic kill on a tank rather than merely penetrating its armor plate. Towed guns similar to the Pak 36 were the only anti-tank weapon issued to European armies during the 1930s, and a number of influential designs proliferated, such as the Böhler gun. By the late 1930s, anti-tank guns had been manufactured by companies in Germany, Austria, France, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Great Britain, Denmark and Sweden. A few countries such as the Soviet Union also manufactured foreign designs under license.|$|E
500|$|Prabhu {{states that}} the charge that the Christians {{constituted}} a united front cannot be sustained. Apart from divergent viewpoints among the Christian community at the time, he argues that difficulties in communication for a minority Christian population spread over a [...] forested coastline broken by numerous streams and rivers, would have made united action practically impossible. He further {{states that the}} majority of Mangalorean Catholics were agriculturists farming land capable of growing three crops a year. The idea of neglecting their fields in the cause of a small band of British isolated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>confines</b> <b>of</b> a fort besieged by a large Mysorean army would have sounded insane. Even if the British had made promises, they would have had little effect on the militarily inexperienced Christians, who would then have had to fight a large and well-trained army in support of a beleaguered army which was not even successful.|$|E
