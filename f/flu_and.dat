He and former PayPal colleague, Russel Simmons, who was also working at MRL Ventures, began brainstorming on how to create an online community where users could share recommendations for local services. Stoppelman and Simmons pitched the idea to Levchin who provided $1 million in initial funding. Under Stoppelman's leadership, Yelp grew to a market capitalization of $4 billion and hosted 138 million user reviews.|$|E
5|$|In the FA Cup third round, Arsenal {{had been}} drawn against Walsall of the Third Division North. Arsenal, as the {{previous}} season's losing finalists and league leaders, were clear favourites to win the match. On the day, five of the Arsenal first team were out with injury or <b>flu</b> <b>and</b> had their places taken by reserves. Arsenal lost 2–0 {{in one of the}} greatest FA Cup upsets. Chapman was enraged by the result, and showed his ruthlessness by selling one player, Tommy Black, who had conceded a penalty in the game, to Plymouth Argyle within a week of the result; another, striker Charlie Walsh, was sold to Brentford a week later.|$|E
5|$|In the off-season, Cloutier was re-signed to a one-year, $2.5 million {{contract}} on July 15, 2003. Nearly two {{months into the}} subsequent season, Cloutier recorded his 100th career NHL win, making 31 saves in a 3–1 victory over the Ottawa Senators on November 27, 2003. As the season progressed, Cloutier suffered several more injuries, {{the first of which}} was a groin injury in December 2003 that sidelined him for three games. He missed three more games before the season ended with cases of the <b>flu</b> <b>and</b> a lower-body injury. On February 14, 2004, he was fined $1,000 by the league for hitting opposing forward Ronald Petrovický in the face with his blocker during a game against the Atlanta Thrashers.|$|E

40|$|NSFC [20777062, 40821063]; SRFDP [200803840015]A fiber-optic Ruorimetry for in situ {{simultaneous}} {{determination of}} fluorine (<b>Flu),</b> phenanthrene (Phe) <b>and</b> fluoranthene (Fla) adsorbed on the leaf surfaces of Kandelia candel (Kc) seedlings was developed. Experimental {{results showed that}} the linear ranges for determination of <b>Flu.</b> Phe <b>and</b> Fla adsorbed on Kc leaves were 35 - 700, 5 - 900 and 2 - 450 ng/spot, respectively. The detection limits for <b>Flu,</b> Phe <b>and</b> Fla were 9. 11, 1. 65 and 0. 90 ng/spot and with the relative standard deviations less than 10. 32 %, 7. 56 % and 4. 29 % (n = 9), respectively. The recovery results for <b>Flu,</b> Phe <b>and</b> Fla adsorbed on Kc leaves were 83. 0 - 91. 2, 78. 5 - 88. 5 and 91. 5 - 107. 3 %, respectively. Under the laboratory experimental conditions, the photolysis processes of <b>Flu,</b> Phe <b>and</b> Fla individual and in mixtures adsorbed on the leaf surfaces of living Kc seedlings were studied. Results showed that the photolysis of <b>Flu.</b> Phe <b>and</b> Fla individual and in mixtures adsorbed on the leaf surfaces of Kc seedlings followed first-order kinetics with photolysis rates in the order of Flu > Fla > Phe on the Kc leaves. An antagonistic effect was found when the three polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were co-adsorbed on living Kc seedlings. The experimental results also indicated that photolysis was the main transformation pathway for <b>Flu,</b> Phe <b>and</b> Fla both individual and in mixtures adsorbed on Kc leaves, whereas disappearance of the adsorbed <b>Flu.</b> Phe <b>and</b> Fla as a result of volatilization and leaf absorption could be negligible during the experimental period.

5|$|During {{the regular}} season, the Hokies {{averaged}} 29.3 {{points per game}} and scored at least 21 points in 22 consecutive games—a streak dating to the 1995 season. Virginia Tech's offense was led on the field by quarterback Al Clark, who passed for 1,476 yards and 10 touchdowns. He also ran for 344 yards during the regular season. At the beginning of December, however, Clark underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left knee in order to repair damaged cartilage in the joint. Due to the long recovery time involved with the surgery, it was questioned if he would play in the Gator Bowl or {{if he would be}} able to play at full strength. Four days prior to the game, Clark's presence at the game was put even more in doubt when he caught the <b>flu</b> <b>and</b> developed a 102-degree fever. Clark's backup, redshirt freshman quarterback Nick Sorensen, completed 11 of his 21 pass attempts during the season for 140 yards and two touchdowns.|$|E

Clearline detected Flu A, <b>Flu</b> B, <b>and</b> A(H 1 N 1) 2009 viruses with a detection limit of 4. 6 × 103 to 7. 5 × 104 pfu/assay. The {{sensitivity and specificity}} of detection of influenza virus by Clearline, using RT-PCR as reference standard, were determined for A(H 1 N 1) 2009, <b>Flu</b> A, <b>and</b> <b>Flu</b> B, in nasopharyngeal aspirate, nasopharyngeal swab, and self-blown nasal discharge specimens. Sensitivity for nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens was: A(H 1 N 1) 2009 = 97. 3 %, Flu A= 94. 5 %, <b>and</b> <b>Flu</b> B= 96. 8 %, <b>and</b> specificity was <b>Flu</b> A= 99. 1 % <b>and</b> <b>Flu</b> B= 100 %. Sensitivity for nasopharyngeal swab specimens was: A(H 1 N 1) 2009 = 91. 9 %, Flu A= 92. 8 %, <b>and</b> <b>Flu</b> B= 100 %, <b>and</b> specificity was <b>Flu</b> A= 98. 2 % <b>and</b> <b>Flu</b> B= 100 %. Sensitivity for self-blown nasal discharge specimens was: A(H 1 N 1) 2009 = 75. 7 %, Flu A= 86. 5 %, <b>and</b> <b>Flu</b> B= 76. 2 %, <b>and</b> specificity was <b>Flu</b> A= 98. 4 % <b>and</b> <b>Flu</b> B= 100 %. Sensitivity and specificity of Clearline were sufficient for nasopharyngeal aspirate and swab specimens. For self-blown nasal discharge specimens, sensitivity was lower than for nasopharyngeal aspirates and nasopharyngeal swabs. The sensitivity of Clearline for A(H 1 N 1) 2009 was good even 6  h after the onset of symptoms. These findings suggest that Clearline may be useful for early clinical diagnosis of influenza...|$|R

That year, SNSK built five new barracks, {{including one that}} {{was made into a}} hospital. SNSK introduced its own money with approval from Norges Bank, consisting entirely of banknotes at par with Norwegian krone. The American community buried their dead at Hotellneset. In 1918, eleven people were killed by the Spanish <b>flu</b> <b>and</b> a graveyard was established in Longyear City. Two years later, 26 men were killed in a coal dust explosion in Mine 1. This resulted in the mine being closed and electric operation being taken into use in Mine 2. The same year, the first truck was delivered for use in the mining operations.|$|E

The necessary arrangements had initially {{been made by}} Brundage's protégé, Spanish IOC member Juan Antonio Samaranch, who would become IOC president in 1980. At the last moment, Brundage cancelled the plans, choosing to have the surgery in Munich, near the home he had purchased in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, site of the 1936Winter Olympics. After {{a month and a}} half, Brundage was discharged from the hospital, though whether the surgery had improved his vision was disputed, with Mariann Brundage stating that it did and Ruegsegger stating the contrary. Now frail, at age 87 he went with his wife on a final tour of the Far East. Despite the efforts of Olympic officials on his behalf, he was not given an invitation to mainland China, source of much of the art he loved. In April 1975, Brundage entered the hospital at Garmisch-Partenkirchen with <b>flu</b> <b>and</b> a severe cough. He died there on May 8, 1975, of heart failure.|$|E

5|$|After {{damaging}} {{the instrument panel}} with a medical ointment and decapitating the scientist, who {{turns out to be}} an android, Jim escapes from the laboratory through the sewer. While searching for Sara, Jim trips next to the wheelchair-bound man, suspects and attacks him. After realizing that he caused a scene and doubts the man's involvement, he returns to the room of the woman, where he discovers she has captured Sara, now wearing a Snow White costume. The woman rambles about her time as a character princess and tells him how bad things happen everywhere, including the decapitation at the park. She again hypnotizes Jim with the necklace, but Sara pulls it off and smashes it, freeing Jim from her spell. He returns to his hotel room and puts his family to bed. Jim suffers with digestive distress, vomits up a large amount of blood and hairballs, which he recognizes as symptoms of the cat <b>flu</b> <b>and</b> realizes that Sophie infected him. He begins to panic and bleed uncontrollably in the bathroom. Elliot enters and Jim begs him for help, but he closes the door on him.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{bounced back}} the {{following}} season, winning their second League title. Arsenal {{had started the}} season weakly, but then went on a long winning run to catch up and then overtake fellow title challengers Aston Villa, whom they beat 5–0 at Highbury in April to clinch the title. By this time Chapman's first set of signings had started to show their age so {{with an eye to}} the future Chapman promoted George Male to the first team to replace Tom Parker, and signed Ray Bowden to take over from David Jack. The only blot on the club's record was an infamous loss to Walsall of the Third Division North in the FA Cup; five of the first team were out with injury or <b>flu</b> <b>and</b> had their place taken by reserves, and without them Arsenal lost 2–0 in one of the greatest FA Cup upsets of all time. One of the stand-ins, Tommy Black, was particularly to blame (conceding a penalty for Walsall's second), and was sold by an enraged Chapman to Plymouth Argyle within a week of the result; another, striker Charlie Walsh, was transferred to Brentford a week later.|$|E

40|$|This {{up-to-date}} overview {{will look}} at the rationale for the recommendation of combination prod-ucts for multi-symptom relief of common cold <b>and</b> <b>flu.</b> Common cold <b>and</b> <b>flu</b> are defined by their multi-symptom nature with data showing a variety of symptoms reported simultaneously each day over the first six days of illness. Multi-ingredient combination products for multi-symptom re-lief are formulated to safely, simply, and simultaneously treat multiple symptoms when used as directed. The rationale for the formulation combination products for common cold <b>and</b> <b>flu</b> is therefore practical, logical and reasonable. No evidence has been found that multi-symptom relief medicines are inherently less safe than single-active ingredient medicines. Multi-symptom relief combination products containing several active ingredients provide a safe, effective, cost-effective, and convenient way of treating the multiple symptoms of common cold <b>and</b> <b>flu,</b> when used as di-rected.
