25|$|Do {{you know}} how offhand that comment was and how many times I’ve had to face it since? I did say that. It was kind of true, {{but it was also}} a bit tongue-in-cheek. We were kind of told that might be the reason. It’s a six-minute song, which {{requires}} maturity for listening. What they specifically said, apparently, was that the voice was too mature. I don’t know if that means <b>I</b> <b>sound</b> old or <b>I</b> <b>sound</b> intelligent. I’m going to hope that it’s the latter.|$|E

500|$|Another person {{planned to}} voice a {{character}} in the film was Janeane Garofalo, who was set to star alongside Farley as Princess Fiona. However, she was fired from the project with little explanation. Years later, Garofalo stated [...] "I was never told why [...] I assume because <b>I</b> <b>sound</b> like a man sometimes? I don't know why. Nobody told me... But, you know, the movie didn't do anything, so who cares?" ...|$|E
500|$|Some syllables (written Chinese characters) {{have special}} pronunciations in Peking opera. This {{is due to}} the {{collaboration}} with regional forms and kunqu that occurred during the development of Peking opera. For example, 你, meaning [...] "you", may be pronounced li, {{as it is in the}} Anhui dialect, rather than the Standard Chinese ni. 我, meaning [...] "I" [...] and pronounced wo in Standard Chinese, becomes ngo, as it is pronounced in the dialect of Suzhou. In addition to pronunciation differences that are due to the influence of regional forms, the readings of some characters have been changed to promote ease of performance or vocal variety. For example, zhi, chi, shi, and ri sounds do not carry well and are difficult to sustain, because they are produced far back in the mouth. Therefore, they are performed with an additional <b>i</b> <b>sound,</b> as in zhii.|$|E

[...] On [...] "Palace", ASAP Rocky demonstrates alliterative lyricism and [...] cadence and flow. His flow patterns have been compared by writers to those of Cleveland-based hip hop group Bone Thugs-N-Harmony. August Brown of the Los Angeles Times writes that [...] "his reserved, steely delivery owes equal debts to Houston's syrup daze and Dipset's uptown intensity". He addresses his rapping style on [...] "Purple Swag": [...] "I'm Texas trill, Texas trill, but in NY we spit it slow". On [...] "Leaf", he addresses hip-hoppers' criticism of his style: [...] "They say <b>I</b> <b>sound</b> like André / mixed with Kanye / {{a little bit of}} Max / a little bit of Wiz / {{a little bit of that}} / a little bit of this / get off my dick".|$|E
500|$|McCain was {{publicly}} {{skeptical about}} the Republican strategy that precipitated the U.S. federal government shutdown of 2013 and U.S. debt-ceiling crisis of 2013 in order to defund or delay the Affordable Care Act; in October 2013 he {{voted in favor of}} the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014, which resolved them and said, [...] "Republicans have to understand we have lost this battle, as I predicted weeks ago, that we {{would not be able to}} win because we were demanding something that was not achievable." [...] Similarly, he was one of nine Republican senators who voted for the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 at the end of the year. [...] By early 2014, McCain's apostasies were enough that the Arizona Republican Party formally censured him for having what they saw as a liberal record that had been [...] "disastrous and harmful". [...] McCain remained stridently opposed to many aspects of Obama's foreign policy, however, and in June 2014, following major gains by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant in the 2014 Northern Iraq offensive, decried what he saw as a U.S. failure to protect its past gains in Iraq and called on the president's entire national security team to resign. [...] McCain said, [...] "Could all this have been avoided? ... The answer is absolutely yes. If <b>I</b> <b>sound</b> angry it's because I am angry." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Massive Dynamic founder William Bell was originally {{meant to be}} revealed earlier in the first season, but the writers changed their minds as the show progressed. In early April 2009, Entertainment Weekly announced that Star Trek actor Leonard Nimoy had been cast as Bell. He and Fringe co-creator J.J. Abrams already had a relationship after working together on the 2009 film Star Trek; Abrams stated {{in an interview that}} he called Nimoy and begged him to join Fringe, explaining the show and the character. Nimoy sounded interested but wanted to become more familiar with the show, so Abrams and the other producers sent him as much information as they could about Fringe, until Nimoy agreed. This exchange of phone calls, in which Nimoy responded with interest when pitched the idea, was also how Abrams was able to cast him in his Star Trek reboot. Nimoy later explained [...] "When they contacted me about working on Fringe -- the same people, the same attitude, the same creativity, the same creative team – it was very enticing". According to Abrams, [...] "The idea that he will play the mysterious, much-referenced William Bell is a thrill. I know <b>I</b> <b>sound</b> like a goofy fan boy, but I can’t help it: Leonard is an icon of the genre and such a wonderful actor. To have him come on board Fringe is a mind-blowing honor".|$|E

Cho {{embarked}} on her [...] "Mother" [...] tour {{in the fall of}} 2013 and slated it for engagements in Europe in 2014. The title of the tour refers not to Cho's impressions of her own mother, but to Cho herself. It is her nickname for the figure she has played to her many gay friends over the years. In 2014, she participated in Do <b>I</b> <b>Sound</b> Gay?, a documentary film directed and produced by David Thorpe. [...] The film is about stereotypes of gay men's speech patterns.|$|E

You can hear it in my voice, <b>I</b> <b>sound</b> all gritty. It’s because I was vaping for a week." [...] "Warm Blood" [...] was produced by Rostam Batmanglij and co-written with Tino Zolfo and Joe Cruz. It initially held the hook [...] "warm love feels good" [...] to which Batmanglij misheard as [...] "warm blood", sticking as its main motif as he was drawn to its physical rather than abstract connotations.|$|E

Translates as [...] "it" [...] & implies that whatever is about to follow it is considered a permanent condition of the item), [...] "Hih" [...] (verb. to spill) & [...] "Gihedenyo" [...] (noun. creek, stream). That being said, the most sensible translation ought to be [...] "Continuously-spilling Creek," [...] or [...] "Continuously-giving creek." [...] The word for creek is used instead of river, since it still flows into a larger river, the Mississippi.|$|E
2500|$|Raising of {{the start}} of the long <b>i</b> <b>sound</b> before voiceless consonants: The long i vowel (...) , as in pine or pie—pronounced [...] in North America—has a {{starting}} sound (an [...] "on-glide") in which the tongue is raised towards [...] or [...] whenever it appears before a voiceless consonant (such as , for instance, in pike or python). Because of this sound change, the words rider and writer [...] are distinguished by their vowel sounds, even though the letters d and t are both pronounced as an alveolar flap [...] It also applies across word boundaries, though the position of a word or phrase's stress may prevent the raising from taking place.

5000|$|In October, {{just over}} a month after its {{original}} release date, Nothing <b>Is</b> <b>Sound</b> was certified gold by the RIAA for selling 500,000 copies. The incredible pacing tapered off significantly, following the revelation of Sony's rootkit on the disks.

[...] Clarkson remarked that [...] "It was a lot of soulful stuff. You know what I'm saying? Like, Radiohead is alternative, but they're very soulful. And Sheryl Crow, very soulful singer-songwriter. So it's all very soulful, rhythmic pop rock." [...] Shortly after the final track listing was revealed, MTV observed that the word [...] "you" [...] featured prominently in the songs' titles. Clarkson asserted [...] "They're all different 'you's'. There's no common, like, it wasn't like one, I didn't have a bad breakup or anything, it wasn't like that.

Nothing <b>Is</b> <b>Sound,</b> was released on September 13, 2005, and with Shirley's inclusion saw Switchfoot's sound become even more densely layered and guitar-heavy, resulting in an album that was edgier and darker than any of their previous work.
