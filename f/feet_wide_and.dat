5|$|Bald eagle nests {{are often}} very large {{in order to}} {{compensate}} for size of the birds. The largest recorded nest was found in Florida in 1963, and was measured at nearly 10 <b>feet</b> <b>wide</b> <b>and</b> 20 feet deep.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{destruction}} from the war, the new ports of Fulton and Rockport were developed in the later 1860s. At first, Rockport was intended as a deep-water port, but after a series of mishaps, Aransas Pass was selected when deepening was approved in 1879. By 1912, a 100 <b>feet</b> <b>wide</b> <b>and</b> 8½ feet deep channel was operational. After hurricanes ransacked the port in 1916 and 1919, the United States Army Corps of Engineers chose Corpus Christi as the preferred deepwater port for the lower Gulf coast.|$|E
5|$|The ground floor, {{accessed}} {{directly from}} the outside courtyard, led into a portcullis-protected, vaulted passage, eleven <b>feet</b> <b>wide</b> <b>and</b> extending {{the depth of the}} building. On either side of the passage were two vaulted rooms. The room nearest the entrance on the right was a guardroom or the porter's room, which housed a well; the back-right room, with a garderobe located in the south west turret (accessed via a passage running along the south wall), was for an official. The other two rooms to the left were used to house staff or storage.|$|E
60|$|They {{proceeded}} with the measuring-board, to mark off, {{and cut out}} by it, solid blocks of snow about four feet long, one <b>foot</b> <b>wide,</b> <b>and</b> one thick.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{need only}} make a hole a <b>foot</b> <b>wide,</b> <b>and</b> {{it need not}} {{be more than a}} foot high," [...] Lucette, the elder, said. [...] "That will be {{sufficient}} for us to squeeze through." ...|$|R
50|$|The board-foot is a {{specialized}} {{unit of measure}} for the volume of lumber in the United States and Canada. It is the volume of a one-foot length of a board one <b>foot</b> <b>wide</b> <b>and</b> one inch thick.|$|R
5|$|In January 1944, workers {{laid the}} {{foundations}} for the first chemical separation building, T Plant located in 200-West. Both the T Plant and its sister facility in 200-West, the U Plant, were completed by October. (U Plant was used only for training during the Manhattan Project.) The separation building in 200-East, B Plant, was completed in February 1945. The second facility planned for 200-East was canceled. Nicknamed Queen Marys by the workers who built them, the separation buildings were awesome canyon-like structures 800 feet long, 65 <b>feet</b> <b>wide,</b> <b>and</b> 80 feet high containing forty process pools. The interior had an eerie quality as operators behind seven feet of concrete shielding manipulated remote control equipment by looking through television monitors and periscopes from an upper gallery. Even with massive concrete lids on the process pools, precautions against radiation exposure were necessary and influenced all aspects of plant design.|$|E
5|$|Several earlier {{settlements}} {{were built}} near modern Southampton featuring protective town walls. Following the Roman conquest of Britain in AD 43 the fortress settlement of Clausentum was established. It {{was an important}} trading port and a defensive outpost for the town of Winchester, located {{on the site of}} Bitterne Manor, today a suburb of modern Southampton. Clausentum was defended on its eastern, landwards side by a flint stone wall and two ditches. After the fall of the Roman Empire, in the 7th and 8th centuries the Anglo-Saxons built a planned settlement called Hamwic, close to the current location of Southampton, approximately on the location of the later St Mary's church. At least some parts of this burh town had a ditch dug around it, 3 m (10 <b>feet)</b> <b>wide</b> <b>and</b> 1.5 m (5 feet) deep, and possibly was defended by a bank of earth. In the 10th century, Viking raids prompted the settlement of Southampton to move to its current location.|$|E
25|$|The {{dimensions}} of the canal vary quite a bit. Below Lock 5, the width is 80 <b>feet</b> <b>wide</b> <b>and</b> 6 feet deep Above Lock 5 to Harper's Ferry it is 60 <b>feet</b> <b>wide</b> <b>and</b> 6 feet deep, and above Harper's Ferry, 50 feet wide.|$|E
50|$|The {{internal}} {{length of}} the church at the abbey was 256 ft by 6 ft making it 70 ft longer than the nearby church of St. James Church at Louth, and the nave, was 61 <b>feet</b> <b>wide,</b> only 11 <b>feet</b> less than Lincoln Cathedral. Its walls were 7 <b>foot</b> <b>wide</b> <b>and</b> constructed from Lincoln stone, sandstone and chalk.|$|R

60|$|At last {{he found}} some boxes under a corn-barn, {{one of which}} he thought would do very well. It was about two feet long, when laid down upon its side, <b>and</b> one <b>foot</b> <b>wide</b> <b>and</b> high. The open part was to be closed by a wire front which was yet to be made.|$|R
50|$|The top of {{the hill}} is bastioned as well and is {{surrounded}} by a parapet. It has a large rainwater cistern with three mouths, each one <b>foot</b> <b>wide,</b> <b>and</b> the ruins of the magazine and a church.

We could see saw-logs go by in the {{daylight}} sometimes, but we let them go; we didn't show ourselves in daylight.|$|R
60|$|He {{assisted}} {{her through}} the marginal underwood {{and down to the}} stones. They walked on together to a tiny cascade about a <b>foot</b> <b>wide</b> <b>and</b> high, and sat down beside it on the flags that for nine months in the year were submerged beneath a gushing bourne. From their feet trickled the attenuated thread of water which alone remained to tell the intent and reason of this leaf-covered aisle, and journeyed on in a zigzag line till lost in the shade.|$|R
25|$|In 2008, the Discovery Channel {{covered the}} work of David Keith, of University of Calgary, who built a tower, 4 <b>feet</b> <b>wide</b> <b>and</b> 20 feet tall (1.2×6.1 meters), with a fan at the bottom that sucks air in, which comes out again at the top. In the process, about half the CO2 {{is removed from the}} air.|$|E
