5000|$|The <b>screw</b> <b>mechanism</b> for {{changing}} hair tension is first mentioned in a French shop inventory of 1747. It was not universally accepted {{for over a}} decade as players were perfectly happy with [...] "clip-in" [...] models: a removable frog held in place by hair tension in a mortise carved into the stick, its tension adjusted by shims between hair and frog surface. However, baroque-style bows produced today almost universally adopt the <b>screw</b> <b>mechanism.</b>|$|R

This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} all-electric injection molding machines, {{as well as the}} application of clamping ball screw, and elaborates the significance of researching lubrication of ball <b>screw</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The formula for calculating the minimum film thickness of ball screw is induced according to Hamrock-Dowson formula and contact parameters of ball <b>screw</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Using the parameters for a specific ball screw model calculates the minimum film thickness at the screw and ball contact.

40|$|The {{reduction}} of the vibratory activity of the roller <b>screw</b> <b>mechanism</b> (RSM) for converting a rotational movement into a translational movement is discussed. A mathematical model of vibratory activity roller <b>screw</b> <b>mechanisms</b> {{on the basis of}} elastic compliances was developed. The resulting equation for calculating the natural frequencies of the basic RSM elements – screw, rollers and nut was obtained. It is proved that the RSM has a low vibroactivity that allows you to create mechatronic actuators, the maximum level of vibration does not exceed 60 to 62 dB, which is 11 - 16 dB below the level of vibratory activity gear mechanisms...|$|R

5000|$|A {{discussion}} of equatorial instruments published in 1793 said that Sisson was {{the inventor of}} the modern version of that instrument, which had been incorrectly attributed to Mr Short. Sisson made his first equatorial instrument of this design for Archibald, Lord Ilay, and it was now held by the college at Aberdeen. The instrument was [...] "very elegantly constructed", with an azimuth circle about 2 ft across. Mr Short ordered Sisson's son Jeremiah to add reflecting telescopes to the instruments and to use <b>endless</b> <b>screws</b> to move the circles,but this design proved inferior to Jonathon Sisson's original.|$|R
50|$|The {{slewing drive}} is a modernized {{take on the}} worm drive {{mechanism}} that dates back many centuries and was widely used during the Renaissance Era. Pappus of Alexandria (3rd century AD), a Greek mathematician is credited for {{an early version of}} the <b>endless</b> <b>screw,</b> which would later evolve into the worm drive. This mechanism was also used by Leonardo da Vinci as a component in many of his designs for machines. It can also be found in the notebooks of Francesco di Giorgio of Siena. Many slewing drive concepts found prominence with the emergence of larger scale construction and engineering in the height of the Greek and Roman Empires.|$|R

A single patent slip was used to launch the boats into Haslar Creek, and to haul them out again on a cradle which ran on railway tracks; a locomotive-driven traverser then delivered the boat (still in its cradle) to {{its place in the}} row of cast iron boat sheds (ten of which still stand, parallel to the creek - at one time there were fifty in total). A small stationary steam engine mounted on the traverser platform drove an <b>endless</b> <b>screw,</b> which was then used to slide the boat back into its shed.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{method of}} {{determining}} the connection force between crop roots and soil was developed. A TG- 1 tensile testing device was designed which consisted of an activities tripod platform, a <b>screw</b> <b>mechanism,</b> a special clamp and sensor-signal processing system. The force transferred to the <b>screw</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{with the help of}} a hand wheel was only 1 / 97 of the maximum connection force between crop roots and soil. The clamp used self-locking structure, and it could clamp most of the crop stalks with different diameters. Take the maximum connection force as the measurand for the connection force between crop roots and soil. Using the TG- 1 tensile testing device, experiments were carried out on oilseed rape. The results showed connection force between oilseed rape roots and soil ranged from 36 N to 237 N. The proportion of the force between 100 and 150 N was the most, taking up 45. 5 %...|$|R

The hair (on the Cramer bow) is wider than the Corelli model but still narrower than a Tourte, the <b>screw</b> <b>mechanism</b> becomes standard, and more sticks are made from pernambuco, rather than the earlier snakewood, ironwood, and china wood, which were often fluted for a portion of the length of the stick.|$|R
50|$|A vernier {{throttle}} is a throttle {{often used}} in aircraft. It uses a cable and a <b>screw</b> <b>mechanism</b> to provide the operator precise control over an engine's operation. The concept is similar in use to vernier calipers which have a primary scale for gross measurements, and a secondary scale for fine measurements.

50|$|A {{differential}} <b>screw</b> is a <b>mechanism</b> {{used for}} making small, precise {{adjustments to the}} spacing between two objects (such as in focusing a microscope, moving the anvils of a micrometer, or positioning optics). A differential screw uses a spindle with two screw threads of differing leads (aka thread pitch), and possibly opposite handedness, on which two nuts move. As the spindle rotates, {{the space between the}} nuts changes based on the difference between the threads. These mechanisms allow extremely small adjustments using commonly available screws. A differential <b>screw</b> <b>mechanism</b> using two nuts incurs higher friction and therefore requires more torque to turn than a simple, single lead screw with an equivalent pitch.|$|R

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of hybrid and fully electric vehicles, electromagnetic suspensions have shown {{great potential for}} capturing energy while offering high-level ride comfort. The objective {{of this research was}} to develop an electromagnetic-based vehicle suspension system that allows for regeneration of road-induced vibration energy and supplies better dynamics control. A small-scale proof-of-concept system consisting of a mass-spring-damper system, ball <b>screw</b> <b>mechanism,</b> and direct current (DC) machine was designed. The vibration energy in the mass-spring-damper system caused vertical motion of sprung mass and the ball <b>screw</b> <b>mechanism</b> to convert the translational motion into rotary motion, which resulted in the generation of back electromotive force of the DC machine. Systematic optimization methodologies were utilized to provide for selective adaption of suspension parameters, such as spring constant (rate) and damping coefficient, according to different road surface conditions, including harmonic and stochastic waveforms. By maximizing the average of power generation or minimizing the root-mean-square of the sprung mass’s absolute acceleration by selecting optimal parameters, the suspension allowed operation in either energy-oriented mode or control-oriented mode. Furthermore, a bandwidth enhancement technique utilizing cubic nonlinearities was demonstrated to improve the energy harvesting capability of the suspension system. A self-powered regenerative Skyhook control strategy was proposed to overcome the trade-off between passive control (insufficient control) and active control (external energy demand) for the suspension system...|$|R

The frog is screwed down {{to the inside of the}} sole through two {{parallel}} slots and on many planes is only adjustable with a screwdriver when the plane iron is removed. Some planes, such as the Stanley Bedrock line and the bench planes made by Lie-Nielsen and WoodRiver/Woodcraft have a <b>screw</b> <b>mechanism</b> that allows the frog to be adjusted without removing the blade.|$|R
50|$|A typical filar {{micrometer}} {{consists of a}} micrometer and a reticle that has two fine parallel wires or threads that can be moved by the observer using a micrometer <b>screw</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The wires are placed in the focal image plane of the eyepiece so they remain sharply superimposed over the object under observation, while the micrometer motion moves the wires across the focal plane. Other designs employ a fixed reticle, against which one wire or a second reticle moves. By rotating the eyepiece assembly in the eyetube, the measurement axis can be aligned to match {{the orientation of the}} two points of observation.|$|R
