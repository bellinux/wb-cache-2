50|$|Electron {{ionization}} (EI, {{formerly known}} as <b>electron</b> <b>impact</b> <b>ionization</b> and electron bombardment ionization) is an ionization method in which energetic electrons interact with solid or gas phase atoms or molecules to produce ions. EI {{was one of the}} first ionization techniques developed for mass spectrometry. However, this method is still a popular ionization technique. This technique is considered a hard (high fragmentation) ionization method, since it uses high energetic electrons to produce ions. This leads to extensive fragmentation, which can be helpful for structure determination of unknown compounds. EI is the most useful for organic compounds which have a molecular weight below 600. Also, several other thermally stable and volatile compounds in solid, liquid and gas states can be detected with the use of this technique when coupled with various separation methods.|$|E
50|$|In solar science, heliospheric pickup ions {{are created}} when neutral {{particles}} inside the heliosphere are ionized by either solar ultraviolet radiation, charge exchange with solar wind protons or <b>electron</b> <b>impact</b> <b>ionization.</b> Pickup ions are generally characterized by their single charge state, a typical velocity that ranges between 0 km/s and twice {{the solar wind}} velocity (~800 km/s), a composition that reflects their neutral seed population and their spatial distribution in the heliosphere. The neutral seed population of these ions can either be of interstellar origin or of lunar-, cometary, or inner-source origin. Just after the ionization, the singly charged ions are {{picked up by the}} magnetized solar wind plasma and develop strong anisotropic and toroidal velocity distribution functions, which gradually transform into a more isotropic state. After their creation, pickup ions move with the solar wind radially outwards from the Sun.|$|E
5000|$|Mass {{resolution}} can {{be improved}} in axial MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer where ion production takes place in vacuum by allowing the initial burst of ions and neutrals produced by the laser pulse to equilibrate and to let the ions travel some distance perpendicularly to the sample plate before the ions can be accelerated into the flight tube. The ion equilibration in plasma plume produced during the desorption/ionization takes place approximately 100 ns or less, after that most of ions irrespectively of their mass start moving from the surface with some average velocity. To compensate for the spread of this average velocity and to improve mass resolution, it was proposed to delay the extraction of ions from the ion source toward the flight tube by a few hundred nanoseconds to a few microseconds {{with respect to the}} start of short (typically, a few nanosecond) laser pulse. This technique is referred to as [...] "time-lag focusing" [...] for ionization of atoms or molecules by resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization or by <b>electron</b> <b>impact</b> <b>ionization</b> in a rarefied gas and [...] "delayed extraction" [...] for ions produced generally by laser desorption/ionization of molecules adsorbed on flat surfaces or microcrystals placed on conductive flat surface.|$|E

We focus on data in the postshock, dayside plasma flow, especially the Magnetic Pileup Boundary (MPB). First, we present the data to characterize {{the features of the}} MPB. Next, we argue the evidence that the MPB is formed through a series of processes, beginning with <b>electron</b> <b>impact</b> <b>ionization</b> of planetary neutrals in the exosphere of Mars. These new ions form an unstable population of energetic ions in the post-shock flow. Ion cyclotron waves are established to scatter the ion distribution into one more stable.

In order to maintain a constant total pressure in the flow, the magnetic field intensifies, transferring the lost ion thermal pressure into magnetic energy. Also, we develop a model of the <b>electron</b> <b>impact</b> <b>ionization</b> process in the martian exosphere.

40|$|Multiple {{electron}} processes occur {{widely in}} atoms, molecules, clusters, and condensed matters {{when they are}} interacting with energetic particles or intense laser fields. In this work, a unified and accurate theoretical formalism is proposed on the direct multielectron processes of atoms including the multiple Auger decay and multiple <b>ionization</b> by an <b>impact</b> of an energetic electron or a photon based on the atomic collision theory described by a correlated many-body Green's function. Such a practical treatment is made possible due to different coherence features of the particles (matter waves) in the initial and final states. We first explain how the coherence characteristics of the ejected continuum electrons is largely destructed, by taking the <b>electron</b> <b>impact</b> direct double <b>ionization</b> process as an example. This process is completely different from the single ionization where the complete interference can be maintained. The detailed expressions are obtained for the energy correlations among the continuum electrons and energy resolved differential and integral cross sections according to the separation of knock-out and shake-off mechanisms for the <b>electron</b> <b>impact</b> direct double <b>ionization,</b> direct double and triple Auger decay, and double and triple photoionization processes.
