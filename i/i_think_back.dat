5|$|You know, I {{think the}} Triton kind of, I think was a spur for that routine as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>back.</b> Because I then {{imagined}} what a trip {{like that would}} have been like with a totally incompetent commander, and the cruise of USS Codfish was the final result.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>back</b> to Poirot’s {{last words}} in the scene before he dies. That second ‘Cher ami’ was for someone other than Hastings. It was for my dear, dear friend Poirot. I was saying goodbye to him as well — and I felt it with all my heart.|$|E
500|$|Ketevan Melua, {{known as}} Ketino to her family, {{was born to}} Amiran and Tamara Melua in Kutaisi, Georgia, which was then part of the Soviet Union. She spent her first years with her {{grandparents}} in Tbilisi before moving {{with her parents and}} brother to the town of Batumi, Ajaria, where her father worked as a heart specialist. During this time, Melua sometimes had to carry buckets of water up five flights of stairs to her family's flat and according to her, [...] "Now, when I'm staying in luxurious hotels, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>back</b> to those days".|$|E

3000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>back</b> home my {{political}} views {{were viewed as}} very liberal (…). But moving here with the same views (…) I’m actually viewed as very conservative. (Interview with A., Oxford, 15 March 2014) [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{almost killed}} {{me to give}} it up. I don't s'pose I'd {{know any of the}} {{scholars}} you know. Even the teachers are not the same. Oh, yes--Sarah Shaw; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> she's <b>back</b> for the normal course." ...|$|R
500|$|Milan manager Carlo Ancelotti {{was delighted}} {{with his team}} after their success. Ancelotti's job had been under threat after a run of poor results in December, {{therefore}} the victory had extra significance for Ancelotti: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>back</b> to December, we had to overcome so many hurdles so {{that makes it a}} very special victory." [...] Milan midfielder Clarence Seedorf, who had his fourth victory in the competition following Milan's triumph was equally proud in the team's achievement: [...] "I am so proud {{to be part of this}} team. We worked hard this year, a very difficult year." ...|$|E
500|$|Coburn {{generated}} controversy {{after the}} race, {{when he said}} the current Triple Crown system allowed [...] "the coward's way out" [...] because fresh horses who had not run in the Kentucky Derby or Preakness Stakes could challenge horses who contested all three legs. [...] Sherman downplayed the outburst, saying, [...] " [...] was at {{the heat of the moment}} ... Sometimes the emotions get in front of you." [...] Two days later, Coburn apologized, saying he wanted to congratulate the owners of Tonalist and adding, [...] "I wanted so much for [...] to win the Triple Crown for the people of America." [...] Steve Haskin of Blood-Horse magazine summarized the race stating, [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>back...</b> the one image that will last forever will be of an exhausted colt walking back through the tunnel with a bloodstained foot, his head down and breathing hard, and every vein protruding from his sweat-soaked body. He had given every ounce of himself, and with it all, still was beaten only [...] lengths." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Lundgren {{has never}} competed as a {{professional}} bodybuilder, he has been closely associated with bodybuilding and fitness since his role as Drago in the mid-1980s. Bodybuilding.com said, [...] "Looking like {{a man in his}} 30s rather than his 50s, Lundgren is the poster boy of precise nutrition, supplementation and exercise application that he has practiced for over 35 years." [...] In an interview with them, he claimed to often train up to six days a week, usually one-hour sessions completed in the morning, saying that [...] "it's just one hour a day, and then you can enjoy the other 23 hours". Although he had begun lifting weights as a teenager, he cites co-star Sylvester Stallone as the man who got him into serious bodybuilding for a period in the 1980s after he arrived in the U.S. Stallone had a lasting influence on his fitness regime and diet, ensuring that he ate a much higher percentage of protein and split his food intake between five or six smaller meals a day. Lundgren has professed never to have been [...] "super strong", saying that, [...] "I'm too tall and my arms are long. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>back</b> then [...] I was working with around 300 pounds on the bench and squat." ...|$|E
5000|$|Holmes was {{inspired}} by MacLean during {{the development of the}} album: [...] "He MacLean may not have been writing or doing those backing vocals, but when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of <b>backing</b> vocals, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of him. Close my eyes, think what would he do? I try to do it." ...|$|R

"Mattie, {{sometimes}} when I'm asleep <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am <b>back</b> there ag'in--and you girls are there--an' we're pullin' off {{the leaves of}} the wild sunflower--'rich man, poor man, beggar man'--and I hear you all laugh when I pull off the last leaf; an' when I come to myself--and I'm an old, dried-up woman, dyin' unsatisfied!" ...|$|R
5000|$|You know, I said it once before, a {{few days}} ago, that Kirk Gibson was not the Most Valuable Player; that the Most Valuable Player for the Dodgers was Tinkerbell. But, tonight, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> Tinkerbell <b>backed</b> off for Kirk Gibson. And, look at Eckersley - shocked to his toes! ...|$|R
2500|$|In My Game Your Game David Campese is {{reported}} saying that, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>back</b> over my Test career, it seems {{most of my}} best performances have been outside Australia, such as the World Cup of 1991 in Britain, the Wallaby Tour of the UK in 1988, and the Grand Slam trip of 1984. There have been some good moments at home, such as the third Test against South Africa at the Sydney Football Stadium in 1993..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Campese {{recovered}} from his disappointing 1988 Bledisloe Cup Series to enjoy {{one of his}} finest ever tours on the 1988 Australia rugby union tour of England, Scotland and Italy, {{as a member of}} the Ninth Wallabies to tour the United Kingdom. In My Game Your Game Campese wrote that, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>back</b> over my Test career, it seems most of my best performances have been outside Australia, such as the World Cup of 1991 in Britain, the Wallaby tour of the UK in 1988, and the Grand Slam trip in 1984. Campese scored 15 tries on tour and achieved a personal total of 72 points.|$|E
2500|$|... "When <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>back</b> to it, it {{was such}} a crucial point to so many people, we didn't even realise back then but it showed us what we would be doing for the next year of our lives. We were never nervous about Anette, or the album being good, but we just couldn't tell how people would take it. Would they like Anette? Would they like the music? That was in the back of our minds all the time. And there was such a huge amount of money involved, over 800.000 euros, that we needed to sell at least a few albums to get going," [...] Tuomas Holopainen was recalling in 2008.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, old fellow," [...] said Hare, [...] "only go slow. From {{the look}} of that foot <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you've turned <b>back</b> on a long trail." ...|$|R
5000|$|He was {{diagnosed}} with stomach cancer in January 2009 and this took time away from his Sky Sports career. In an interview in February 2013, Chamberlin said: [...] "There isn't a day go by when <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>back</b> to my illness and remind myself just how fortunate I am." ...|$|R

2500|$|With Pawsey's help, £630,000 {{was raised}} from the Ford Foundation {{to build the}} Culgoora radio-{{heliograph}}. Years later he was to admit [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>back</b> I wonder how I {{had the nerve to}} do it." [...] The heliograph stayed in operation for 17 years from 1967, providing a huge amount of data and insight into the way the solar corona works and the relationship between solar and terrestrial phenomena. Wild published more than 70 papers in this field. The heliograph also played a leading supporting role in both the Skylab missions of 1973–74 and the solar maximum mission of 1980–81, providing real-time observations of coronal activity. It was de-commissioned in 1984 {{to make way for the}} Australia Telescope and transferred to the Ionospheric Prediction Service, where it is still used today for space weather monitoring of solar activity. Now there are at least 20 ground-based radio-spectrographs operating around the world.|$|E
2500|$|... {{noted that}} Rowling admires Roddy Doyle and Jane Austen, saying [...] "both of whom write about class distinctions," [...] {{and asked if}} the reason Rowling wrote about class was a {{conscious}} decision. Rowling replied, [...] "kids are acutely aware of money—before they're aware of class. A kid isn't really going to notice how another kid holds his knife and fork. But a kid will be acutely aware that he doesn't have pocket money. Or that he doesn't have as much pocket money. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>back</b> to myself at 11. Kids can be mean, very mean. So it was there in Ron not having the proper length robes, you know? And {{not being able to}} buy stuff on the trolley. He's got to have sandwiches his mum made for him, even though he doesn't like the sandwiches. Having enough money to fit in is an important facet of life—and what is more conformist than a school?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, Ed Droste {{described}} Shields as Grizzly Bear's [...] "most verbose album" [...] yet, noting, [...] "It's funny, because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>back</b> to a song like [...] "Colorado", where I {{was basically}} singing ten words {{over and over}} again for five minutes straight – and that's it. There's nothing on this album like that. There's a lot more there, verbally, and it's definitely emotionally charged." [...] Bassist and producer, Chris Taylor stated, [...] "For this record, it was really important to us to try and make sure that lyrics had a weight to them and at least some sense of a narrative, even if it was loose. There were lyrics in previous albums that seemed to have no meaning whatsoever. And that always really annoyed me. We agreed it'd be really important and awesome if we could just try and make all the lyrics tell something. [...] I was definitely able to use lyrics as a frame to how I would let the arrangements build and then fall away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There," [...] he exclaimed, as a {{sound of}} firing was heard in the rear, [...] "they have {{come down on the}} convoy from behind. We had better, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> fall <b>back</b> a bit; and take post near the mouth of the defile. We must defend ourselves, as best we can, till morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{if you go}} <b>back,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I'll go <b>back</b> myself," [...] said Tom. [...] "Anyway, {{this tour}} seems to {{have come to a}} standstill, with so much rain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"It's--it's--very curious, Sir," [...] {{replied the}} sexton, half dead with fright; [...] "very curious, and very pretty, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I'll go <b>back</b> and finish my work, Sir, if you please." ...|$|R
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>back</b> to this {{transaction}} I am {{bitten by}} a kind of remorseful shame. It was such a shabby little lodging for my artist bride, and yet, at the moment, it seemed all that we could safely afford, and she cheerfully made the best of it. Never by word or sign did she hint that its tiny hall and its dingy and unfashionable furnishings were unworthy of us both, on the contrary she went ahead with shining face.|$|E
60|$|The first {{detachment}} {{is therefore}} gone; I hope that we, the rest, will follow in about sixteen or eighteen days. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>back</b> over these twelve years. On the whole, how smoothly and easily they have passed with me! Less of sorrow and anxiety than was crowded into one short year of Bishop Mackenzie's life. I {{have been reading}} Mr. Rowley's book on the University Mission to Central Africa, and am glad to have read it. They were indeed fine gallant fellows, full of faith and courage and endurance.|$|E
6000|$|... [She {{is wearing}} these jewels yet {{and she says}} she loves them--but as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>back</b> to that brown cloak I am not so sure that her {{approval}} was without misgiving. It may be that she secretly hated that coat for it was an unusual color, and while its lines were graceful in my eyes it may have been [...] "all out of style."--What became of it, finally, I am unable to say. No matter, it expressed for me a noble sentiment and it shall have a place on this page with the Oriental brooch and the amethyst necklace.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've got {{a little}} headache, that's all. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I'll go <b>back</b> to the {{bungalow}} and rest," [...] returned Jessie; and went on ahead, soon disappearing within one of the buildings.|$|R
6000|$|... "More than likely. For {{all we know}} he {{may be one of}} the firm!" [...] went on Dick suddenly. [...] "Wait, I've got an idea. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I'll go <b>back</b> {{to those}} offices." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You trust me, mate," [...] the man replied. [...] "My {{wife is a}} good soul, but {{her tongue}} runs {{nineteen}} to the dozen, and {{you might as well}} shout a thing out at Paul's Cross as drop it into her ear. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> my <b>back</b> will be well enough for me to come to work again to-morrow," [...] he added, with a laugh.|$|R
60|$|I {{did not go}} so far as {{to think}} of a life without labor (I {{expected}} to work in the North till February, then rest and ride horse-back for three months in the South), but I did hope to relieve Zulime of some of her drudgery. Now that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>back</b> to it, I am not at all sure that my wife rejoiced over my plan to go to Weatherford to purchase another farm. It is probable that I overcame her objections by telling her that I wanted more material for my book of Indian tales; anyhow I left her in Chicago almost as soon as we arrived there, and went again to Darlington and Colony to see Major Stouch and John Seger, and to make certain observations for President Roosevelt.|$|E
60|$|I {{know all}} about how I {{happened}} to be wrecked and be there alone of all my ship's company--it was a great drowning and a great wind; but I do not moon over the catastrophe. When <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>back</b> at all, rather do I think far back to my childhood at the skirts of my milk-skinned, flaxen-haired, buxom English mother. It is a tiny village of a dozen straw-thatched cottages in which I lived. I hear again blackbirds and thrushes in the hedges, and see again bluebells spilling out from the oak woods and over the velvet turf like a creaming of blue water. And most of all I remember a great, hairy-fetlocked stallion, often led dancing, sidling, and nickering down the narrow street. I was frightened of the huge beast and always fled screaming to my mother, clutching her skirts and hiding in them wherever I might find her.|$|E
60|$|Quick, vivid, and sharp, {{the little}} Giuseppino was always central. But he seemed almost invisible. When <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>back,</b> I can {{scarcely}} see him, I {{can only see}} the others, the lamplight on their faces and on their full gesticulating limbs. I can see--the Maddelena, rather coarse and hard and repellent, declaiming her words in a loud, half-cynical voice, falling on the breast of the Alfredo, who was soft and sensuous, more like a female, flushing, with his mouth getting wet, his eyes moist, as he was roused. I can see the Alberto, slow, laboured, yet {{with a kind of}} pristine simplicity in all his movements, that touched his fat commonplaceness with beauty. Then there were the two other men, shy, inflammable, unintelligent, with their sudden Italian rushes of hot feeling. All their faces are distinct in the lamplight, all their bodies ate palpable and dramatic.|$|E
6000|$|... "Something the matter! No, there's not; nothing worth talking of. Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I'll go <b>back</b> to Devonshire {{and live}} there. I could stay with Blanche for a time, {{and then get}} a lodging in Exeter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's dreadful, isn't it? But you've got a hope to go back. I haven't." [...] She {{ended with}} a sigh, a far-off {{expression}} in her eyes. [...] "It almost killed me to give it up. I don't s'pose I'd {{know any of the}} scholars you know. Even the teachers are not the same. Oh, yes--Sarah Shaw; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> she's <b>back</b> for the normal course." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> should <b>back</b> {{my little}} friend," [...] said Lord John, caressing his Express. [...] "But the beast would {{certainly}} have a good sporting chance." ...|$|R
