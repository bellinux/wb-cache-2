5|$|In {{his second}} term, Patton {{initiated}} an oil recycling program {{and established a}} work program <b>for</b> <b>welfare</b> mothers in day care centers. He oversaw {{construction of a new}} jail and a $5million renovation to the county courthouse. He brought the county its first manufacturing company and stopped the practice of giving away gravel, drains, and bridge lumber from district warehouses to private citizens. Among his other priorities as judge/executive were the construction of rural roads and recreation facilities.|$|E
5|$|Under communism, {{everyone}} was guaranteed employment. However, women suffered the double burden of paid and unpaid work, leading to lower birth rates. The commitment to social equality {{and the issue}} of declining birth rates allowed women to have some rights, such as child care and child allowances. For example, in the Soviet Union, maternity leave was extended to three years and part-time work was introduced. With the collapse of communism, many of these rights have been revoked due to the new largely male oriented democracy that has been put in place. Although there has been an increase in female workers, their need <b>for</b> <b>welfare</b> support such as child care has not been met, and has been ignored.|$|E
5|$|After lambs {{are several}} weeks old, lamb marking (ear tagging, docking, and castrating) is carried out. Vaccinations are usually {{carried out at}} this point as well. Ear tags with numbers are attached, or ear marks are applied, for ease of later {{identification}} of sheep. Castration is performed on ram lambs not intended for breeding, although some shepherds choose to omit this for ethical, economic or practical reasons. However, many would disagree with regard to timing. Docking and castration are commonly done after 24 hours (to avoid interference with maternal bonding and consumption of colostrum) and are often done not later than one week after birth, to minimize pain, stress, recovery time and complications. The first course of vaccinations (commonly anti-clostridial) is commonly given at an age of about 10 to 12 weeks; i.e. when the concentration of maternal antibodies passively acquired via colostrum {{is expected to have}} fallen low enough to permit development of active immunity. Ewes are often revaccinated annually about 3 weeks before lambing, to provide high antibody concentrations in colostrum during the first several hours after lambing. Ram lambs that will either be slaughtered or separated from ewes before sexual maturity are not usually castrated. Tail docking is commonly done <b>for</b> <b>welfare,</b> having been shown to reduce risk of flystrike. Objections to all these procedures have been raised by animal rights groups, but farmers defend them by saying they solve many practical and veterinary problems, and inflict only temporary pain.|$|E

25|$|David Ricardo {{supported}} {{the abolition of}} the Poor Law in his book 'Principles of Political Economy and Taxation' published in 1817.

He also argued that it rewarded laziness, discouraged people from saving for old age or illness, and encouraged irresponsibly large families.|$|E
40|$|To {{rationalize}} federal {{cutbacks in}} spending <b>for</b> public <b>welfare,</b> President Reagan charged that public welfare programs {{are responsible for}} leading to a "national tragedy involving family breakdown, teen-age illegitimacy and worsening poverty. " Yet analysis of 1980 and 1982 census data for the 50 states suggests that if this is so, {{it is because of}} low, not high, spending <b>for</b> public <b>welfare.</b> While low state spending <b>for</b> public <b>welfare</b> is predictive of high teen illegitimacy rates and directly linked to high state poverty and divorce rates, higher state spending <b>for</b> public <b>welfare</b> is predictive of lower teen birth rates, and linked to lower rates of family breakup and poverty. Despite limitations inherent in the analysis, the findings challenge the contention that spending <b>for</b> public <b>welfare</b> contributes to family breakup, teen illegitimacy and poverty.

40|$|The public’s concern <b>for</b> animal <b>welfare</b> is {{evolving}} {{and it is}} important to consider factors that are related to concern for animals and their use by humans. An online survey of 825 U. S. residents was conducted. Relationships between approval of animal uses and stated concern <b>for</b> animal <b>welfare</b> were examined. More than 90 % of respondents reported that using animals for egg production, service or therapy, pets, and milk production was acceptable to them. Respondents who were younger or reported being female less frequently found most uses acceptable than older or male respondents. Half of respondents reported concern <b>for</b> the <b>welfare</b> of bison while 40 % or more stated concern <b>for</b> the <b>welfare</b> of elk, beef cattle, and dairy cattle. Respondents who stated they were concerned <b>for</b> the <b>welfare</b> of dairy cattle less frequently reported accepting using animals for meat production, livestock shows, and hunting. Thus, self-reported concern for animal species and acceptance of the use of animals were related in some instances. A better understanding of the factors related to acceptance of animal uses and concern <b>for</b> animal <b>welfare</b> will help animal-related industries and wildlife agencies develop practices that are consistent with public attitudes...|$|R

40|$|Now the {{assignment}} of B-public <b>welfare</b> residents <b>for</b> persons with disabilities to the juridical person <b>for</b> social <b>welfare</b> has been planning in A-city. The aim {{of this article is}} to examine this planning and the background of it and to show C-juridical person's attitude toward this planning from the following points. First of all I simply argue why a drastic reduction of social security and a basic-structural reformation (a changing for the worse) of social welfare such a plan mentioned above is occurred. Next I demonstrate that {{the assignment}} to the juridical person <b>for</b> social <b>welfare</b> is considerably different from running for profit and I show the essence of the juridical person <b>for</b> social <b>welfare</b> and it's public character and what a placement policy is. And I examine the policy about making use of social welfare under commercial contract and the relation between this policy and free markets. Lastly I think about running for profit (privatization) in social welfare and the importance of each juridical person <b>for</b> social <b>welfare</b> against such privatization. From the points as mentioned above I conclude that C-juridical person <b>for</b> social <b>welfare</b> will be able to accept B-public <b>welfare</b> residents <b>for</b> persons with disabilities better than other juridical persons <b>for</b> social <b>welfare</b> in A-city...|$|R
