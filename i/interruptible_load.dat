50|$|Firm services, {{also called}} {{uninterruptible}} services, are services, such as electricity {{and natural gas}} supplies, that are intended to be available at all times during a period covered by an agreement. Also, the service {{is not subject to}} a prior claim from another customer and receives the same priority as any other firm service. Conditional firm service is similar to firm service in that it is reserved and has priority over interruptible service. However, it can have restrictions, such as times when it would be curtailed before firm service but after interruptible service. The cost per unit with this service is called a firm rate or uninterruptible rate. The opposite of firm service is non-firm service, also called interruptible service or as-available service. The cost per unit for this service is called a non-firm rate or interruptible rate. The <b>interruptible</b> <b>load</b> is the portion of a utility's load that comes from customers with interruptible service.|$|E
50|$|According {{to several}} {{articles}} and news sites, the Philippines faced {{a power supply}} shortage leading to rolling blackouts across the country during the years 2014-2015. In late 2014, President Aquino requested the Congress to pass a resolution giving him emergency power to allow the government to provide additional supply and prevent a power shortage in 2015. However, {{the passing of the}} resolution was delayed and Aquino admitted that his original plan was no longer feasible. His proposal was tweaked and the <b>Interruptible</b> <b>Load</b> Program (ILP) was recommended for use in the Luzon power grid instead. The ILP essentially enrolls large establishments, including government owned and controlled corporations, with their own generators to voluntarily disconnect from the main grid and switch to their generators instead when a power outage was predicted. Their rationale was that a power outage would cause these establishments to run on generators anyway so it is more beneficial for them to run their generators in an organized fashion.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- <b>Interruptible</b> <b>loads</b> are {{consumers}} who {{agree to be}} interrupted, or whose consumption may be reduced by the utility, {{in order to maintain}} system security or to reduce market prices. Incorporating <b>interruptible</b> <b>loads</b> in day-ahead markets could maximize their potential in providing ancillary services because it enables them to plan their operations, and for them to offer reliable curtailment capacities and competitive bids. This paper investigates the use of binary particle swarm optimization to schedule a set of <b>interruptible</b> <b>loads</b> over a 16 -hour period. The scheduling objective is to minimize the total payments to the <b>interruptible</b> <b>loads</b> and the frequency of interruptions, and to satisfy the required hourly curtailments and operational constraints imposed by the <b>interruptible</b> <b>loads.</b> The constraints in this multi-objective optimization problem were handled using four constraint-handling methods: using static and adaptive penalty functions, tracking only feasible solutions, and using repair algorithms.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new long-run network pricing model that {{can account for}} network users' {{preference}} for security of supply when assessing their impact on network development costs. The new model firstly classifies load at each node into interruptible and uninterruptible parts according to their different security preference. It then seeks to examine {{the impact on the}} network development costs from a marginal increment of the two types of loads at each node. It assumes that <b>interruptible</b> <b>loads</b> can be interrupted under contingencies, whereas both loads should be satisfied under normal conditions. Use-of-system (UoS) charges are then calculated by translating the impact on network development costs into locational long-run network charges. Compared with the existing approach which assumes that consumers at the same locations are subject to the same security levels, the proposed approach acknowledges users' different security preference, respects the reduced requirement on the network development costs from <b>interruptible</b> <b>loads,</b> and prices users' UoS charges accordingly. The paper demonstrates that network charges for <b>interruptible</b> <b>loads</b> are cheaper than those for the uninterruptible loads at the same node. The degree of the difference depends on the percentage of <b>interruptible</b> <b>loads</b> in the system and at the node. The pricing signals could incentivize prospective users to switch their behaviors in favor of lowering the overall network security requirements, and thus lowering network reinforcement costs. This will ultimately bring down users' UoS charges. The effectiveness of the proposed approach over the basic security-based long-run pricing model is illustrated on two networks in terms of charges for the two loads and the impact of load composition on the charges...|$|R

30|$|Many recent nodal {{analysis}} {{studies have}} been assessing reliability issues using DR programs to boost system performance on all nodes. The studies, however, do not consider, or are limited by, the following factors: 1) unknown type {{of participants in the}} DR programs; 2) assuming or considering an ideal amount of <b>interruptible</b> <b>loads</b> without previous knowledge of nodal reliability and/or interruption capacity by node; and 3) considering only one period of time (generally, peak period), or three clusters (one around a demand peak; another off-peak and one in a valley). To address the limitations above, this paper develops a mechanism for obtaining high reliability nodal prices and compensating for nodal interruption, using incentive based programs (IBP) based on DR. The nodal identification of <b>interruptible</b> <b>loads</b> is based on the expected nodal energy not supplied (ENENS) and a structural decomposition of the system reserves in order to improve the loss of load probability (LOLP) reliability index. The method sets both a tariff for high nodal reliability performance and a “money back” payment incentive for <b>interruptible</b> <b>loads.</b> Thus, it offers users on DR programs a transparent, simple way to calculate their expected amount of reimbursements based on their level of service interruptions. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section  2 describes the mathematical modelling. Section  3 describes methodology of the estimation of a representative annual demand curve. Section  4 describes the experimental section with an IEEE_RTS 24 -node system. Section  5 discusses the results of applying the methodology, and offers suggestions for future research.|$|R

The integration of renewable energy generation schemes into interruptible contracts is studied in [15]. In [16], a scheme for incentive DR programs that enables the DR provider to compute individual demand curtailments and DR rewards while preserving customers’ privacy. An energy efficient optimization model which offers incentives to end users curtailing their energy use during times of peak demand is reported in [17]. To benefit a customer by minimizing electricity cost, the proposed model optimally schedules the electricity consumption of different household appliances in a dynamic pricing environment. An implementation of DR to improve network reliability proposed in [18] uses a non-linear mathematical model of the incentive DR programs to identify the most reliable and conservative responsive model.

40|$|Reliability {{optimization}} can {{be applied}} in both conventional and non-conventional generating system planning. This thesis is concerned with generation adequacy optimization, with emphases on applications to wind energy penetration planning and <b>interruptible</b> <b>load</b> utilization. New models, indices and techniques for generation adequacy optimization including wind turbines and <b>interruptible</b> <b>load</b> utilization have been developed in this research work. A sequential Monte Carlo simulation technique for wind power modeling and reliability assessment of a generating system {{was developed in the}} research associated with optimum wind energy penetration planning. An auto-regressive and moving average (ARMA) time series model is used to simulate the hourly wind speeds. Two new risk-based capacity benefit indicators designated as the Load Carrying Capability Benefit Ratio (LCCBR) and the Equivalent Capacity Ratio (ECR) are introduced. These two indices are used to indicate capacity benefit and credit associated with a windenergy conversion system. A bisection technique to assess them was further developed. The problem of determining the optimum site-matching windturbine parameters was studied with the LCCBR and ECR as the optimization objective functions. Sensitivity studies were conducted to show the effect of wind energy penetration level on generation capacity benefit. A procedure for optimum penetration planning was formed, which extends the methods developed for conventional generation adequacy optimization. A basic framework and techniques to conduct <b>interruptible</b> <b>load</b> analysis using sequential Monte Carlo simulation were created in the research associated with <b>interruptible</b> <b>load</b> utilization. A new index designated as the Avoidable Additional Generating Capacity (AAGC) is introduced.

40|$|Power {{companies}} world-wide {{have been}} restructuring their electric power systems from a vertically integrated entity to a deregulated, open-market environment. Previously, electric utilities usually sought {{to maximize the}} social welfare of the system with distributional equity as its main operational criterion. The operating paradigm was based on achieving the least-cost system solution while meeting reliability and security margins. This often resulted in investments in generating capacity operating at very low capacity factors. Decommissioning {{of this type of}} generating capacity was a natural outcome when the vertically integrated utilities moved over to deregulated market operations. The erstwhile objective of maximizing social welfare with distributional equity was then replaced by a profit-maximizing objective with efficiency as the main criterion for the generating companies. As a consequence, power producers are no longer responsible for the system reliability margins in deregulated markets. Additionally, new investments in generating capacity are not easily forthcoming since private investors look for a high rate of return of capital employed, which becomes increasingly difficult to ensure in a competitive environment. These factors, being a consequence of deregulation, have triggered a need for the research and implementation of <b>interruptible</b> <b>load</b> management - ILM. In an ILM program, the customer enters into a contract with the independent system operator (ISO) to reduce its demand as and when requested. The ISO benefits in having additional reserve for its security management services, while the customer benefits from reduction in energy costs and from incentives provided by the contract. Though this concept is not new, it has attained a new significance because of the deregulation. This thesis proposes a model for a competitive market for <b>interruptible</b> <b>load</b> customers where they can offer to reduce (a part of) their demand, as an ancillary service provision to be procured by the ISO. The operational objective of the proposed market would be minimizing the total ILM procurement costs while satisfying the system operational constraints. It is shown that an <b>interruptible</b> <b>load</b> market can help the ISO to maintain the operating reserves during peak load periods. Econometric analysis reveals that a close relationship exits between the reserve level and the amount of <b>interruptible</b> <b>load</b> service invoked. It was also found that at certain buses, market power could exist which may lead to unwanted inefficiencies in the market. Investing in generation capacity at such buses can mitigate this. The thesis also examines the role of <b>interruptible</b> <b>load</b> during contingencies and peak demand in the power system. In particular the ability of the <b>interruptible</b> <b>load</b> market in providing transmission congestion relief is analysed. In the proposed congestion management scheme, interruptible loads can specifically identify those load buses where corrective measures are needed for relieving congestion in a particular transmission corridor. While examining the role of <b>interruptible</b> <b>load</b> in providing for congestion management, it is necessary to arrive at a long-term solution for persistent congestions, i. e., bottlenecks in the system. An answer to this, is investment in reserve generation at strategic locations in order to provide for efficient congestion relief. Long-term investment needs for fast start-up generators that can alleviate transmission bottlenecks and provide additional operating reserves were investigated by a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis and a least-cost optimization scheme...|$|E
