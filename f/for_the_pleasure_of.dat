5|$|Buffy's former nemesis is Spike (James Marsters), a vampire. In {{the fourth}} season The Initiative, a secret {{military}} organization whose {{mission is to}} evaluate and eliminate demonic beings, rendered Spike harmless by implanting a microchip in his head that causes him intense pain when he attacks humans. However, the chip does not affect him when he harms demons and he now often fights on Buffy's side, after at first fighting just <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>of</b> brawling. His motivations changed when, in the fifth season, Spike realized he {{had fallen in love}} with Buffy. She initially rejected him, but after and just before her death they had begun to form a friendship of sorts. She has been confiding in him; prior to this episode, he is the only one to whom Buffy has revealed that she was in heaven.|$|E

Participation is a key precept for {{the community}} – selfless giving of one's unique talents for the enjoyment of all is encouraged and actively reinforced. Some of these generous outpourings of creativity can include experimental and interactive sculpture, building, performance, and art cars among other media, often inspired by the yearly theme, chosen by organizers.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the 18th century, the {{composer}} was normally {{an employee of}} an aristocrat, and the chamber music he or she composed was <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>of</b> aristocratic players and listeners. Haydn, for example, was an employee of Nikolaus I, Prince Esterházy, a music lover and amateur baryton player, for whom Haydn wrote many of his string trios. Mozart wrote three string quartets for the King of Prussia, Frederick William II, a cellist. Many of Beethoven's quartets were first performed with patron Count Andrey Razumovsky on second violin. Boccherini composed for the king of Spain.|$|E

25|$|Havelock Ellis, in Studies in the Psychology of Sex, {{argued that}} there is no clear {{distinction}} between the aspects of sadism and masochism, and that they may be regarded as complementary emotional states. He also made the important point that sadomasochism is concerned only with pain in regard to sexual pleasure, and not in regard to cruelty, as Freud had suggested. In other words, the sadomasochist generally desires that the pain be inflicted or received in love, not in abuse, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>of</b> either one or both participants. This mutual pleasure may even be essential for the satisfaction of those involved.|$|E
25|$|The {{players are}} cast as slaves who {{are forced to}} fight in a fantasy gladiator arena, which is reason for the game title. The slaves are from a village where people are bred solely to be gladiators and fight <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>of</b> demon types to win their freedom. The players have the help of Balfus, a Spirit Mentor, and need to {{overcome}} the challenges and defeat the guardians of each arena. Spirit Mentors guide gladiators through the arena and Balfus is revealed to have done so for previous dead gladiators before the player. Balfus remains the source of drama since the protagonists are silent throughout {{the game and the}} antagonists do not go beyond taunting them.|$|E

He later published the Plateau Mont-Royal Chronicles, a cycle of six novels including The Fat Woman Next Door is Pregnant (La grosse femme d'à côté est enceinte, 1978) and The Duchess and the Commoner (La duchesse et le roturier, 1982). The second novel of this series, Therese and Pierrette and the Little Hanging Angel (Thérèse et Pierrette à l'école des Saints-Anges, 1980), {{was one of the}} novels chosen for inclusion in the French version of Canada Reads, Le combat des livres, broadcast on Radio-Canada in 2005, where it was championed by union activist Monique Simard.|$|E

The temple’s benefactor preferred this site in the city centre to those that she owned in the outskirts: the site of the circus or the site where the Temple of Celeste was later built. Gabinia’s family, one of the richest in Dougga, was well placed within Carthage’s notables and maintained its power at Dougga, even during the reduction of the local aristocracy in the 3rd century. The terms of Gabinia’s will provide evidence of her concern that the family should endure - the annual banquet would keep alive the memory of the family’s generosity and emphasise its sociability, while the circus would provide <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>of</b> the most humble of the city’s inhabitants.|$|E
25|$|Tensely, {{people watch}} for the {{hurricane}}'s arrival. The men sing a hymn-like admonition not to be afraid. Jim meditatively compares Nature's savagery to the far greater destructiveness of Man. Why do we build, he asks, if not <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>of</b> destroying? Since Man can outdo any hurricane, fear makes no sense. For the sake of human satisfaction, nothing should be forbidden: If you want another man's money, his house or his wife, knock him down and take it; do what you please. As Begbick and the men ponder Jimmy's philosophy, Fatty and Moses rush in with news: The hurricane has unexpectedly struck Pensacola, destroying Begbick’s enemies, the federal agents. Begbick and her cohorts {{take it as a}} sign that Jimmy is right; they join him, Jenny, and his three friends in singing a new, defiant song: If someone walks on, then it's me, and if someone gets walked on, then it's you. In the background, the men continue to chant their hymn as the hurricane draws nearer.|$|E
500|$|Smith {{wrote that}} male {{heterosexual}} improvisers typically dismissed women in audiences as not important, seeing them as [...] "either wives, girlfriends, or groupies". She said FIG seized {{this opportunity to}} change the relationship between improvisers and female audiences. Using their [...] "skills of social and technical virtuosity", FIG improvised around issues important to women, and thereby [...] "drew women into their music who might not otherwise be concerned {{with the concept of}} free improvisation." [...] Smith explained that even women not familiar with the technicalities of free improvisation still related to a group of women on stage [...] "foreground their bodies and their sounds <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>of</b> other woman".|$|E

50|$|One factor {{hidden in}} the decline of students’ {{recreational}} reading is that it coincides with {{a decline in the}} amount of time adults read to them.

500|$|Dyer {{has stated}} that Monroe's star image was created mainly for the male gaze and that she usually played [...] "the girl", who is defined solely by her gender, in her films. Her roles were almost always chorus girls, secretaries, or models; occupations where [...] "the woman is on show, there <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>of</b> men." [...] Film scholar Thomas Harris, who {{analyzed}} Monroe's public image in 1957, wrote that her working class roots and lack of family made her appear more sexually available, [...] "the ideal playmate", in contrast to her contemporary, Grace Kelly, who was also marketed as an attractive blonde, but due to her upper-class background {{came to be seen}} as a sophisticated actress, unattainable for the majority of male viewers.|$|E
500|$|A Vindication of the Rights of Woman {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} works of feminist philosophy. In it, Wollstonecraft argues that women ought to have an education [...] with their position in society and then proceeds to redefine that position, claiming that women are essential to the nation because they educate its children and because they could be [...] "companions" [...] to their husbands rather than mere wives. Instead of viewing women as ornaments to society or property to be traded in marriage, Wollstonecraft maintains that they are human beings deserving of the same fundamental rights as men. Large sections of the Rights of Woman respond vitriolically to conduct book writers such as James Fordyce and John Gregory and educational philosophers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who wanted to deny women an education. (Rousseau famously argues in [...] (1762) that women should be educated <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>of</b> men.) ...|$|E
500|$|One of the {{earliest}} accounts of an ascent of Helvellyn <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>of</b> doing so is contained in James Clarke's guidebook of 1787. He quotes the account of an unnamed gentleman from Penrith who wanted to eat his dinner on Midsummer Day while sitting in a snowdrift on top of Helvellyn. The man left home {{at two in the}} morning, rode to Glencoyne and left his horse at a house in the valley there. He started to walk up the mountain at between four and five in the morning and after five hours hot and hard work he reached the snow and the summit. The snow was covered with dust so he had to dig for clean snow to eat with his dinner. He returned by a different route, reaching Glencoyne ten hours after leaving it. This story seems to reflect the colder climatic conditions of the eighteenth century, during the so-called [...] "Little Ice Age".|$|E

500|$|The plot of Full Sequence {{involves}} {{a man who}} after becoming sexually obsessed with a DVD recording of First Sequence decides to create his own human centipede. The film had been planned for a DVD release in the United Kingdom. However, upon submitting the film to the BBFC for classification, the film was rejected due to content that was [...] "sexually violent and potentially obscene". The BBFC's report criticised the film as making [...] "little attempt to portray any of the victims in the film {{as anything other than}} objects to be brutalised, degraded and mutilated for the amusement and arousal of the central character, as well as <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>of</b> the audience" [...] and that the film was potentially in breach of the Obscene Publications Act, meaning its distribution in the UK would be illegal. Bounty Films, the UK distributor, appealed the decision, and the film was eventually passed with an 18 certificate in October 2011. To achieve the 18 rating, thirty-two cuts were made from the film, removing two minutes and thirty-seven seconds from the original version.|$|E
500|$|True Detective explores Christianity and the {{dichotomy}} {{between religion and}} rationality. Born into a devout Catholic household, Pizzolatto said that as a child he saw religion as storytelling that acts [...] "as {{an escape from the}} truth". According to Andrew Romano at The Daily Beast, the season alludes to Pizzolatto's childhood and creates a parallel between Christianity and the supernatural theology of [...] "Carcosa": [...] "Both...are stories. Stories people tell themselves to escape reality. Stories that 'violate every law of the universe.'" [...] Romano believed this message is not critical of religion per se, rather it shows how the [...] "power of storytelling" [...] and religious zeal [...] "can wind [...] up in some pretty sick places." [...] Jeff Jensen from Entertainment Weekly has opined that the show becomes more self-aware through Cohle's harsh critiques of religion, which he viewed as a vehicle for commentary about pop culture escapism. Stapleton observed that the crimes on True Detective—through its victims and the implications of sacrifice and sexual violence—"respond to the conservative Christianity from which they originate, and seek to exploit the opportunities <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>of</b> transgression such a structure offers." ...|$|E
500|$|Wollstonecraft attacks conduct book {{writers such}} as James Fordyce and John Gregory as well as {{educational}} philosophers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau who argue that a woman does not need a rational education. (Rousseau famously argues in [...] (1762) that women should be educated <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>of</b> men; Wollstonecraft, infuriated by this argument, attacks not only it but also Rousseau himself.) Intent on illustrating the limitations that contemporary educational theory placed upon women, Wollstonecraft writes, [...] "taught from their infancy that beauty is woman's sceptre, the mind shapes itself to the body, and, roaming round its gilt cage, only seeks to adorn its prison", implying that without this damaging ideology, which encourages young women to focus their attention on beauty and outward accomplishments, they could achieve much more. Wives could be the rational [...] "companions" [...] of their husbands and even pursue careers should they so choose: [...] "women might certainly study the art of healing, and be physicians as well as nurses. And midwifery, decency seems to [...] to them... they might, also, study politics... Business of various kinds, they might likewise pursue." ...|$|E
