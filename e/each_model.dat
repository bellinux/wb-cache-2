5|$|The VP {{update of}} 1991 {{featured}} cosmetic changes and mechanical however most were not visible {{unless you were}} to pull the motor down; and a very similar revised 3.8-litre V6 and 5.0-litre V8 engines from the VN were carried over. The 2.0-litre straight-four engine previously available in New Zealand was discontinued. Exterior cosmetic changes included a translucent acrylic grille on the base level Executive and Berlina, with a colour-coded grille for the S and SS, and a chrome grille for Calais. Updated tail lights and boot garnishes were {{also a part of}} the changes, which were different for <b>each</b> <b>model,</b> with the Berlina having grey stripes and the Calais chrome stripes. Semi-trailing arm independent rear suspension became standard on the Calais and SS, but was made an option on lower-end models in lieu of the live rear axle, improving ride and handling.|$|E
5|$|The {{impacts of}} the various options were {{estimated}} as the differences between a carbon tax and a reference ‘business as usual’ scenario assuming New Zealand had not signed the Kyoto Protocol. The variables changed in the model runs were the NZ carbon price ($0, $10, $25 or $100), the world carbon price, the duration (short term to 2012, long term to 2025), the level of free allocation and whether the Government assumed all Kyoto liabilities. The results of <b>each</b> <b>model</b> run was reported as the percent difference from the 'no-Kyoto' ‘business as usual’ scenario in 2012 or 2025.|$|E
5|$|When {{interpreted}} as a proof within a first-order set theory, such as ZFC, Dedekind's categoricity proof for PA shows that <b>each</b> <b>model</b> of set theory has a unique model of the Peano axioms, up to isomorphism, that embeds as an initial segment of all other models of PA contained within that model of set theory. In the standard model of set theory, this smallest model of PA is the standard model of PA; however, in a nonstandard model of set theory, {{it may be a}} nonstandard model of PA. This situation cannot be avoided with any first-order formalization of set theory.|$|E

All vehicles were equipped with five-spoke aluminium alloy wheels, the naturally aspirated model had 16-inch wheels and the turbo models were 17-inch. The difference in wheel size was to accommodate the larger brakes equipped as standard onto the turbo model, but in Japan were optional extras. Both models had a space saver spare tire on a steel rim to save both space and weight.|$|E
