25|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>well</b> {{placed at}} table between {{one of the}} Miss McGillivray's and a singular-looking person of about fifty. He was plainly dressed, quiet, and observant. His figure was short and compact, and his black hair was worn long all round, and cut square, as if by one stroke of the shears, just above the eyebrows. His {{complexion}} was of the gardener's ruddy brown, while the expression of his deeply-furrowed features was friendly and intelligent, but his cut-short nose gave him an odd look. His speech betrayed the Welshman, although he left his native hills when very young. I might have been spared this description of Mr David Thompson by saying he greatly resembled Curran the Irish Orator...|$|E
500|$|When Lennon {{was living}} in the United States he asked his half-sister, Julia Dykins, to send the clock that was {{previously}} in the living room at Mendips, which had been passed down through Smith's family, and was inscribed with the words, [...] "George Smith, Woolton Tavern", onto a metal plate on the back. In Lennon's last published interview, he said: [...] "This image of me being an orphan is garbage, because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>well</b> protected by my auntie and uncle [...] and they looked after me very well, thanks".|$|E
500|$|Yankovic {{was dismayed}} by the album's lackluster reception. He noted that he [...] "thought {{it was the end}} of [...] career". Yankovic {{explained}} that [...] "I figured I'd peaked with 'Eat It' and 'Like a Surgeon' and now people were slowly forgetting about me and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>well</b> on my way to obscurity." [...] However, Yankovic's next album, Even Worse, would resurrect his career and become his best-selling album at the time; the experience led Yankovic to realize that [...] "careers have peaks and valleys, and whenever I go through the rough times, another peak might be right around the corner." ...|$|E

500|$|Caspersen was {{a talented}} equestrian in {{carriage}} driving, winning three national championships and representing the United States at three world championships. In 1985, {{he won the}} four-in-hand carriage driving competition at the Royal Windsor Horse Show in the United Kingdom and later was an honorary lifetime officer of the show. According to Sports Illustrated, Caspersen, described as [...] "portly and patrician, tall and splendidly erect, {{with a lot of}} beef in his jowls" [...] recalled being asked by Queen Elizabeth II at the awards ceremony about his role in driving his team of Holsteiners: [...] "I told her it was to lower the carriage's center of gravity,... She looked at my midriff and said <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>well</b> suited for the job." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The next morning, heart pounding, I went to {{my teacher}} before class so that I wouldn’t weaken. “Miss Shofstal,” I stammered, “I can’t salute the flag anymore. The Bible says at Exodus chapter 20 that we can’t have any other gods before Jehovah God.” To my {{surprise}} she just hugged me and said what a dear girl <b>I</b> <b>was.</b> <b>Well,</b> when the flag ceremony time came, I did not join in the salute." [...] -"The Courage to Put God First", Awake!, July 22, 1993, ©1993 Watch Tower, page 13 and {{schools around the country}} began expelling Witness students and firing Witness teachers. Jehovah's Witnesses published the booklet Loyalty, making the matter an official doctrine of the faith before the end of 1935. Witnesses hired teachers and set up “Kingdom schools” to continue their children’s education.|$|E
2500|$|Discussing {{his life}} in New York, Popović said: [...] "I never stopped keeping tabs on things back home. Personally, I felt like my life ended. War, the country disintegrated, I lost the job that I worked for so many years, the only thing I had left was raising my children. There was a {{newsstand}} on the 42nd Street that sold Večernje novosti and Vreme and I'd go there every day to get the paper and read it cover to cover. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>well</b> informed. I also had contacts with numerous human rights {{organizations such as the}} Human Rights Watch and UN Human Rights Committee that asked for my input on the situation once they found out I'm in New York. In the beginning, the information coming out of the Balkans was unclear, incomplete, and misinterpreted. Yugoslavia was low on their list of priorities. Germany was uniting, USSR was disintegrating, we were the last item on the priority list. I never turned down invitations to speak at meetings and lectures that were being held everywhere from schools, churches and city chambers. People from all over the former Yugoslavia would come and I always used my participation to insist on the establishment of the international war crimes tribunal".|$|E

2500|$|In 1995, {{following}} a spell {{in a drug}} rehab clinic, which first alerted the public to her drug problem, Westbrook was reintroduced into EastEnders by executive producer Corinne Hollingworth. She has commented, [...] "the call from the producers couldn't {{have come at a}} more opportune moment for me. The soap was suffering from poor ratings and so they decided, as they normally do, to bring some familiar faces back onto the Square. The producers were aware of my addiction by now [...] but they had also read that I was now clean [...] once I assured them that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>well</b> [...] they invited me back for another year." [...] The character's [...] "dramatic" [...] return to EastEnders aired on 25 July 1995 and began when her screen brothers traced Sam to Spain and she ended up in bed with [...] "bad boy" [...] David Wicks (Michael French). Several cast changes had occurred since Westbrook had last been in the soap, including a recast of her screen mother Peggy, who was now played by Barbara Windsor. As well as her former friends, Westbrook has revealed that she became particularly close to Windsor, who she says [...] "instantly took me under her wing", and Martine McCutcheon, who played Tiffany Raymond.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{references}} {{are made to}} previous multi-Doctor anniversary stories, The Three Doctors and The Five Doctors. The Eleventh Doctor's dismissal of the Tenth Doctor and War Doctor as [...] "Sandshoes and Grandad" [...] to mock their respective footwear and age echo the First Doctor's description of his two successors in The Three Doctors as [...] "a dandy and a clown". (The War Doctor's initial incredulous reaction upon seeing his future selves also reflects this moment.) Likewise, a Time Lord says, [...] "I didn't know when I was well-off. All twelve of them." [...] which recalls the Brigadier's line from The Three Doctors: [...] "Three of them, eh? I didn't know when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>well</b> off." [...] More of the Brigadier's dialogue from the latter serial is alluded to when Kate asks for an incident report code-named [...] "Cromer"; in the earlier story, upon being transported to another universe, the Brigadier initially believes himself to be near the coastal Norfolk town. A line from the First Doctor from The Five Doctors is also reused near the end as the Tenth Doctor tells the Eleventh, [...] "It's good to know my future is in safe hands" [...] (which the First told the Fifth in the earlier story, appended by [...] "after all"). When the War Doctor appears, Clara remarks, [...] "I think there's three of them," [...] to which Kate responds, [...] "There's a precedent for that," [...] in reference to The Three Doctors.|$|E
2500|$|Orwell was {{an atheist}} who {{identified}} {{himself with the}} humanist outlook on life. Despite this, and despite his criticisms of both religious doctrine and of religious organisations, he nevertheless regularly participated {{in the social and}} civic life of the church, including by attending Church of England Holy Communion. Acknowledging this contradiction, he once said: [...] "It seems rather mean to go to HC [...] when one doesn't believe, but I have passed myself off for pious & there is nothing for it but {{to keep up with the}} deception." [...] Orwell was also extremely well-read in Biblical literature and could quote lengthy passages from the Book of Common Prayer from memory. His extensive knowledge of the Bible came coupled with unsparing criticism of its philosophy, and as an adult he could not bring himself to believe in its tenets. He said in part V of his essay, [...] "Such, Such Were the Joys", that [...] "Till about the age of fourteen I believed in God, and believed that the accounts given of him were true. But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>well</b> aware that I did not love him." [...] Despite this, he had two Anglican marriages and left instructions for an Anglican funeral. Orwell directly contrasted Christianity with secular humanism in his essay [...] "Lear, Tolstoy and the Fool", finding the latter philosophy more palatable and less [...] "self-interested." [...] Literary critic James Wood wrote that in the struggle, as he saw it, between Christianity and humanism, [...] "Orwell was on the humanist side, of course—basically an unmetaphysical, English version of Camus’s philosophy of perpetual godless struggle." ...|$|E
