Local hotels were concerned that after the Olympics an Olympic Village would so significantly increase the hotel capacity it would put many of them out of business. Athletes were billeted by local <b>families</b> <b>or</b> stayed in hotels during the Games.|$|E

5|$|Across the Philippines, Typhoon Lee killed 188 people. In addition, 674,619 {{people were}} {{directly}} affected by the typhoon. Furthermore, 76,169 dwellings were demolished while 39,586 <b>families,</b> <b>or</b> 208,336 people, were rendered as homeless. A total of 53,314houses were partially damaged. Also, 548,525people sought refuge in shelters. Additionally, 1,586 individuals were injured due to Lee. Overall, damage totaled to $74.1million (1981USD), $46.4million of which was from infrastructure and an additional $2.2 million came from agriculture.|$|E

In all, approximately 1,000 dwellings were damaged in relation to Hurricane Paul; many other homes across the region were left without electricity and running water. A total of 495 people were taken to shelters, including 93 in Ciudad Insurgentes and 300 in San Carlos. Overall, 5,000 <b>families</b> <b>or</b> 16,000 people were directly affected by the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Celtiberian is {{documented}} as a written language only after {{contact with the}} Romans in the 2nd century BC. Of 103 Celtiberian inscriptions, thirty in Iberian script are hospitality tokens (tesserae hospitales), twenty {{of which are in}} the shape of animals. The social custom of pledging mutual support among <b>families</b> <b>or</b> communities was compatible with hospitium in Roman culture, and the Celtiberians continued to produce the tokens, though switching to Latin, into the 2nd century of the Imperial era. Under Augustus, the territory of the Celtiberians became part of the Tarraconensis province. Written Celtiberian ceases early in the reign of Augustus, if not before.|$|E

5|$|Five leading <b>{{families}}</b> <b>or</b> factions contended {{for power}} during this period—the Shahs, Thapas, Basnyats, Pandes, and the Chautariyas, who were of Shah dynasty but acted as counselors for the King. Working for these {{families and their}} factions were hill Brahmans, who acted as religious preceptors or astrologers, and Newars, who occupied secondary administrative positions. No {{one else in the}} country had any influence on the central government. When a family or faction achieved power, it killed, exiled, or demoted members of opposing alliances. Under these circumstances, there was little opportunity for either public political life or coordinated economic development.|$|E
5|$|Taraki's Government {{initiated}} a land reform on 1 January 1979 which attempted {{to limit the}} amount of land a family could own. Those whose landholdings exceeded the limit saw their property requisitioned by the government without compensation. The Afghan leadership believed the reform would meet with popular approval among the rural population while weakening the power of the bourgeoisie. The reform was declared complete in mid-1979 and the government proclaimed that 665,000 hectares (approximately 1,632,500 acres) had been redistributed. The government also declared that only 40,000 <b>families,</b> <b>or</b> 4 percent of the population, had been negatively affected by the land reform.|$|E

5|$|All beetle larvae {{go through}} several instars, {{which are the}} {{developmental}} stages between each moult. In many species, the larvae simply increase in size with each successive instar as more food is consumed. In some cases, however, more dramatic changes occur. Among certain beetle <b>families</b> <b>or</b> genera, particularly those that exhibit parasitic lifestyles, the first instar (the planidium) is highly mobile to search out a host, while the following instars are more sedentary and remain on or within their host. This is known as hypermetamorphosis; it occurs in the Meloidae, Micromalthidae, and Ripiphoridae. The blister beetle Epicauta vittata (Meloidae), for example, has three distinct larval stages. Its first stage, the triungulin, has longer legs to go {{in search of the}} eggs of grasshoppers. After feeding for a week it moults to the second stage, called the caraboid stage, which resembles the larva of a carabid beetle. In another week it moults and assumes the appearance of a scarabaeid larva – the scarabaeidoid stage. Its penultimate larval stage is the pseudo-pupa or the coarcate larva, which will overwinter and pupate until the next spring.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 25, Muhammad {{married the}} wealthy Khadijah bint Khuwaylid who was 40 years old. The {{marriage}} lasted for 25years and was a happy one. Muhammad did not enter into marriage with another woman during this marriage. After Khadija's death, Khawla bint Hakim suggested to Muhammad that he should marry Sawda bint Zama, a Muslim widow, or Aisha, daughter of Um Ruman and Abu Bakr of Mecca. Muhammad {{is said to have}} asked for arrangements to marry both. Muhammad's marriages after the death of Khajida were contracted mostly for political or humanitarian reasons. The women were either widows of Muslims killed in battle and had been left without a protector, or belonged to important <b>families</b> <b>or</b> clans whom it was necessary to honor and strengthen alliances with.|$|E
5|$|Following the Surrender of Japan to the Allied forces, Japanese {{military}} personnel and civilians were repatriated to Japan between 1945 and 1946, although some 350 labourers and technicians were permitted to remain behind to carry out repair works to Palau's infrastructure. However, offspring of Japanese-Palauan intermarriages were allowed to remain, although a few migrated to Japan with their fathers. In the 1950s, Japanese-Palauans formed an organisation, Sakura-kai to assist Japanese-Palauans and Japanese youths who were abandoned by their parents to search for their parents and kinsmen who were forcibly separated {{as a result of}} forced repatriation of Japanese settlers back to Japan. The organisation became a cultural organisation from the 1980s onwards, as most Japanese-Palauans had reunited with their Japanese <b>families</b> <b>or</b> voluntarily chose to leave certain family separations as they were.|$|E

5|$|From the Permian, {{numerous}} stem group {{representatives of}} mayflies are known, {{which are often}} lumped into a separate taxon Permoplectoptera (e.g. including Protereisma permianum in the Protereismatidae, and Misthodotidae). The larvae of Permoplectoptera still had 9 pairs of abdominal gills, and the adults still had long hindwings. Maybe the fossil family Cretereismatidae from the Lower Cretaceous Crato Formation of Brazil also belongs as the last offshoot to Permoplectoptera. The Crato outcrops otherwise yielded fossil specimens of modern mayfly <b>families</b> <b>or</b> the extinct (but modern) family Hexagenitidae. However, from the same locality the strange larvae and adults of the extinct family Mickoleitiidae (order Coxoplectoptera) have been described, which represents the fossil sister group of modern mayflies, {{even though they had}} very peculiar adaptations such as raptorial forelegs.|$|E
5|$|In the present, Rick's {{group has}} entered the CDC {{building}} in Atlanta with help from its sole remaining scientist, Dr. Edwin Jenner (Noah Emmerich). Jenner makes them undertake a blood test to prove they are not infected. The group enjoys the luxuries of the facility, which is self-powered and still has running water, food, alcohol, and other amenities. Jenner admits {{he is the only}} researcher that stayed behind, many of the others having left for their <b>families</b> <b>or</b> committed suicide. A drunk Shane approaches Lori Grimes (Sarah Wayne Callies) about her callous attitude towards him with Rick's return and attempts to rape her, but backs off when she scratches his neck.|$|E
5|$|Irregular moons {{are small}} {{satellites}} with large-radii, inclined, and frequently retrograde orbits, {{believed to have}} been acquired by the parent planet through a capture process. They often occur as collisional <b>families</b> <b>or</b> groups. The precise size as well as albedo of the irregular moons are not known for sure because the moons are very small to be resolved by a telescope, although the latter is usually assumed to be quite low—around 6% (albedo of Phoebe) or less. The irregulars generally have featureless visible and near infrared spectra dominated by water absorption bands. They are neutral or moderately red in color—similar to C-type, P-type, or D-type asteroids, though they are much less red than Kuiper belt objects.|$|E

5|$|The Hadza {{people of}} Tanzania also share food, {{possibly}} to gain in reputation. Hunters cannot be sharing meat mainly to provision their <b>families</b> <b>or</b> to gain reciprocal benefits, as teenage boys often give away their meat {{even though they}} do not yet have wives or children, so costly signalling of their qualities is the likely explanation. These qualities include good eyesight, coordination, strength, knowledge, endurance, or bravery. Hadza hunters more often pair with highly fertile, hard-working wives than non-hunters. A woman benefits from mating with a man who possesses such qualities as her children will most likely inherit qualities that increase fitness and survivorship. She may also benefit from her husband’s high social status. Thus, hunting is an honest and costly signal of phenotypic quality.|$|E
5|$|The Palmyrene council {{consisted}} {{of about six}} hundred {{members of the local}} elite (such as the elders or heads of wealthy <b>families</b> <b>or</b> clans), representing the city's four-quarters. The council, headed by a president, managed civic responsibilities; it supervised public works (including the construction of public buildings), approved expenditures, collected taxes, and appointed two archons (lords) each year. Palmyra's military was led by strategoi (generals) appointed by the council. Roman provincial authority set and approved Palmyra's tariff structure, but the provincial interference in local government was kept minimal as the empire sought to ensure the continuous success of Palmyrene trade most beneficial to Rome. An imposition of direct provincial administration would have jeopardized Palmyra's ability to conduct its trading activities in the East, especially in Parthia.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after Omar's {{landfall}} in Guam, former Governor Joseph Franklin Ada {{declared a}} state of emergency, and former U.S. President George H. W. Bush declared the island a federal disaster area. In the wake of the storm, several people were arrested for looting. The Federal Emergency Management Agency opened up disaster assistance centers where residents were able to apply for federal aid; it ultimately provided about $18.4million in assistance, including disaster housing, storm-related unemployment benefits, and grant programs for <b>families</b> <b>or</b> businesses, helping over 11,000people. The federal government paid for 100% of the debris removal, emergency work, and reconstruction of uninsured public buildings, although it usually only provide 75% of the cost for typical disasters. This was due to the sequence of three significant tropical cyclones affecting the United States in three weeks; in addition to Omar, Hurricane Andrew struck Florida in August and Hurricane Iniki hit Hawaii in September. The Department of Defense assisted the affected areas with 27members of the Guam National Guard and 700members of the military. The military provided temporary housing, generators, and construction supplies, at a cost of $5.75million, though most of the disaster needs were handled by the government. The local Red Cross provided $6million in assistance after the storm. Due to the combined damages from Andrew, Iniki, and Omar, the United States Congress passed the Dire Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1992, which provided additional funding for the agencies responding to the disasters through the fiscal year ending on September30.|$|E
