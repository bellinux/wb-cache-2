5|$|The next front {{action for}} Ledbury came later on that day, at 08:20, when the {{destroyer}} began signalling, 'Eight air torpedo-bombers 210 degrees, five miles', {{and then two}} minutes later, 'for eight read ten'. Suddenly after Ledburys signals, all the escorts seemed to be blinking morse-signals at once. The loudspeakers were booming, 'Bombers approaching... there's six of them... there's twelve... there's eighteen... good God, there's twenty-five!' The anti-aircraft ship lurched forward and altered course to head off the attack. Commodore Dowding signalled Keppel to ask if the convoy should make an 'emergency turn'; but it was deemed too late for such a manoeuvre, since half the ships would most likely miss the signal altogether and Broome flashed back, 'I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> worth it.' The developing air attack spotted by Ledbury turned into a blitz of the convoy, with Luftwaffe aircraft being shot down over the formation, and one plane crashed into the sea about four thousand yards from the destroyer , on the convoy's starboard bow. The crash occurred not far from Ledbury and seamen on board saw four German airmen climbing out into a rubber dinghy with the bomber sinking soon after. The pilot, Lieutenant Kaumeyr, and his three crewmen were picked out of their dinghy by Ledbury. The attack however, continued and throughout the fierce fighting the escorts distinguished themselves by screening the merchantmen from many attacks, especially U-boat sorties; Ledbury alone had sighted seven.|$|E

25|$|The {{effects of}} fiscal policy can {{be limited by}} {{crowding}} out. When there is no output gap, the economy is producing at full capacity {{and there are no}} excess productive resources. If the government increases spending in this situation, the government use resources that otherwise would have been used by the private sector, so there is no increase in overall output. Some economists think that crowding out is always an issue while others <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is a major issue when output is depressed.|$|E

25|$|The {{nature of}} Germanic {{places of worship}} {{has long been a}} subject of {{scholarly}} debate. Tacitus famously wrote in Germania:The Germans <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> in keeping with the divine majesty to confine gods within walls or to portray them in the likeness of any human countenance. Their holy places are woods and groves, and they apply the names of deities to that hidden presence which is seen only by the eye of reverence. There are in fact several sites in the historical period at which heathen rites apparently took place in the open, including Hove in Trøndelag, Norway, where offerings were apparently brought to images of the gods on a row of ten posts, but no trace of buildings was found. Yet Tacitus himself wrote of an image of Nerthus. And in his Annals he refers to a temple of Tanfana. Most older scholars considered that a hof would be a dedicated temple: an independent sacred place, built specifically for ritual proceedings, comparable to a Christian church. By extension, it was also commonly believed that the hofs had been located on the same sites as the churches that had superseded them.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{his initial}} reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving {{practical}} advice {{to help the}} composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought. Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, {{and to get the}} orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number. Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, [...] "I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now." [...] However, he told his wife in 1963 that the Rite was [...] "now fifty years old, and I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> has aged at all. I had pleasure in conducting the fiftieth anniversary of Le Sacre this spring".|$|E

500|$|In late 1910, the new {{government}} introduced legislation to revoke the A's charter and confiscate the proceeds {{from the sale of}} bonds, which were still held by the province. [...] In introducing the bill, Sifton made no commitment as to what would be done with the funds once confiscated. [...] Many northern MLAs, including Cornwall and Cross, suspected that the Premier's plans for the money did not include construction of a northern railway, and opposed the bill on that basis. [...] Clarke re-surfaced in Winnipeg to deny Sifton's charge that the A had defaulted on any of its obligations, and Conservative leader Bennett opposed the confiscation out of stated respect for private property: [...] "Clarke I despise but Clarke I am bound to respect because this province gave him a right by charter and if I know the United States I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> will allow this province to take his property 'without due process of law'." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{speaking}} of A President William Clarke (an American), Bennett {{went on to}} say [...] "Clarke I despise but Clarke I am bound to respect, because this province gave him a right by charter and if I know the United States I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> will allow this province to take his property without due process of the law." [...] The Conservatives, however, had not been expected to support the legislation; the real question was whether Sifton could command enough support among Liberals to pass it. [...] After all, during the Alberta and Great Waterways crisis only nine months earlier, a legislature of very similar makeup had endorsed the Rutherford government's handling of railway policy by a vote of twenty-three votes to fifteen; would Sifton's bill, effectively a repudiation of the Rutherford policy, convince enough Liberals to change sides? [...] The answer came in December, when the bill passed third reading by a vote of twenty-five votes to fourteen. [...] Nine Liberals had reversed themselves and saved Sifton's government, though both Cross and Rutherford were among those to vote against it.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the synagogue}} had {{undertaken}} innovations {{in some areas}} of Jewish law, it still insisted on strict adherence in others. In 1878 Tinter was dismissed for officiating at the marriage of a Jewish woman and Christian man, and Baith Israel was, for a time, the only congregation in Brooklyn that celebrated Jewish holidays for the traditional two days. In 1889 Baith Israel asserted it was [...] "the only orthodox congregation in the city", and that year the board forced the resignation of a Mr. J. Folkart, for transgressing the laws of Yom Kippur. In 1892, when Hyman Rosenberg was expelled as rabbi of Brooklyn's Beth Jacob synagogue for eating ham, the Brooklyn Eagle canvassed local rabbis for their views on the matter. While George Taubenhaus, rabbi of Beth Elohim stated, [...] "I do not believe my congregation would expel me if I ate ham", Baith Israel's rabbi Friedlander responded, [...] "While there are some differences between the reform and orthodox Jews, I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is the place for any Jewish minister to eat ham. The reformers do not so strictly observe the old Mosaic law, but {{it does not seem to}} me a good example for a rabbi to set to his congregation." ...|$|E

The court martial went into an in camera session while sensitive evidence was being heard. Lody claimed that he had asked in August to be erased from military service on the grounds of poor health and to be allowed to travel to the United States. This was refused, he went on, but a member of naval intelligence whom he had previously never met coaxed him into undertaking a mission in the UK on the condition that he could go to the US afterwards. Lody told the tribunal that he was not pressured but that [...] "I have never been a coward in my life and I certainly would not be a shirker", and that he had persisted with his mission because [...] "once a man has promised to do a thing he does it, that is the understanding." [...] His services were provided [...] "absolutely as an honour and free", while he had never intended to be a spy: [...] "I was pressed for secret service, but not as a spy– oh, no. If that would have been mentioned to me at Berlin I surely would have refused. The word in the sentence, I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> goes together."
