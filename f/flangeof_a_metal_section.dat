40|$|There are {{different}} options {{to obtain a}} structural glass beam with a span of more than 6 meters. One option is segmentation, which has many advantages compared with the other options. However, the choice for segmentation is often avoided, because of aesthetical reasons. Existing connections, even the most slender ones, result in a reduction of the transparency of the beam. While transparency is the key reason to use glass beams. An edge integrated <b>metal</b> <b>section,</b> {{which is used to}} reach safe failure behavior, seems to provide an opportunity for a more transparent connection. By coupling of the <b>metal</b> <b>section,</b> the tensile force can be transferred in quite a transparent way. <b>A</b> <b>metal</b> <b>section</b> is not transparent, but by integrating it in the edge of the beam, the transparency of the beam will hardly decrease. The opportunity of connecting beam segments in an edge integrated way, to achieve a highly transparent segmented glass beam, is explored.

The Brazilian-built Up differs from its European counterpart in length (it is 65 mm longer), thanks to revisions to the floorpan's rear section to accommodate a larger fuel tank (50L instead of Europe's 35L), a full-sized spare wheel and increased cargo space.

40|$|A {{new design}} for X band {{dielectric}} accelerator using a TE-TM mode converter {{has been proposed}} and studied. It first converts RF from TE to TM mode in <b>a</b> pure <b>metal</b> <b>section,</b> then <b>a</b> tapered transition section is used for high efficiency transmission to the dielectric accelerator section. Because there is no dielectrics near the RF coupler, this scheme has potential to overcome RF breakdown problems near the coupling holes in the dielectric based accelerators, as {{it happened in the}} older designs. A detailed design study shows that high conversion efficiency ({approx} 100 %) can be achieved for both single and dual coupling ports and it is less sensitive to machine errors than previous designs. Another advantage of this design is that it can be made to different modules thus greatly reduce the R&D cycles...|$|R

40|$|At TU Delft, SentryGlas (SG) {{laminated}} glass beams with <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> reinforcement <b>section</b> laminated at the tensile {{edge of the}} beam, have been developed. Current study focuses {{on the effect of}} beam size on the post-breakage strength of the beams. To do so, bending tests have been performed on small 1. 5 m relatively large 3. 2 m beam specimens. To simultaneously investigate their lateral stability at the post-breakage stage, the large beams have been tested in a lateral buckling test setup. The test results demontrated a slight reduction in post-breakage strength level of the large beams compared to the small beams. It is therefore concluded that the size effect on the post-breakage performance is limited. Furthermore, the tests showed that global lateral buckling only occurs to a limited extent at the post-breakage stage. It is therefore concluded that lateral buckling is not crucial for the safety performance of the beams...|$|R

40|$|A {{model of}} {{deformation}} of <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> hollow <b>section</b> beam under a uniform blast loading is developed {{in order to}} reveal the characteristic features of deformation and energy absorption of hollow section beams under such loading. It is established that as a typical structural component a hollow section distinguishes itself from its solid counterpart with two characteristic features of the response. First, a considerably larger kinetic energy is generated in the hollow section beam as the impulsive load is imparted on the upper flange of the beam having a significantly lower mass than the member. Second, a considerable proportion of the blast energy can be absorbed by the local collapse of the section. A two-phase analytical model is proposed. In the first phase, the local collapse of the thin-walled cross-section is determined by using an upper bound approach; and in the subsequent second phase, the global bending of the beam with the distorted section is analyzed by {{taking into account the}} effect of axial force. It is demonstrated that mass distribution in the hollow section {{is an important factor in}} determining the energy partitioning between the local deformation phase and global bending of the hollow beam. Reasonable agreement is obtained with the experimental data published in the literature [Jama HH, Nurick GN, Bambach MR, Grzebieta RH, Zhao XL, Steel square hollow sections subjected to transverse blast loads, Thin-Walled Structures 2012; 53 : 109 - 122]...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Pulmonary {{embolism}} is {{an important}} cause of cardiovascular death. Inferior vena cava filters {{have been shown to}} be effective for prevention of this condition. Objectives To determine the safety, performance and efficacy of a new inferior vena cava filter in an ovine model. Methods BKone 1 filters are self-centering with over-the-wire deployment, have three filtering regions and are made from nickel-titanium alloy. Eight of these filters were implanted in 8 sheep. The sheep were divided into 4 groups of two animals (A and B) and the number of clots injected differed by group. Two clots were injected in group 2, four in group 3, eight in group 4 and zero clots in group 1. A animals underwent euthanasia soon after the procedure and B animals were observed for 30 days and then euthanized after a control cavography. All inferior vena cavas were processed for histological examination. Clots were prepared in <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> mold, <b>sectioned</b> and then radiopaque markers were inserted. Clot capture was analyzed by identifying the radiopaque marker on fluoroscopy. Results No clot migration was observed during follow-up. Control cavographies showed patent inferior vena cavas. Pathological examination indicated little inflammatory tissue response. All clots were captured in the condition with 2 clots, only one clot was missed in the group injected with 4 clots and in the condition of 8 clots, they were partly captured. Conclusions The filters were deployed safely. There was a reduction in efficacy as the number of blood clots increased...|$|R

50|$|The <b>metal</b> <b>section</b> {{frame was}} <b>an</b> {{innovation}} in twentieth century picture framing. It {{can now be}} found in museums, galleries, institutions, and homes around the world. The <b>metal</b> <b>section</b> frame was invented by picture framer Donald P.

While there he met with Dr. Harold Joachim (1909-1983), {{at that time the}} Curator of the Department of Prints and Drawings with The Art Institute of Chicago. Dr. Joachim discussed the need for a picture frame that would allow the Institute to loan artwork from their collection. He expressed the need for an easily assembled and affordable picture frame. Herbert’s solution was the section frame. Originally he planned to call the frame a CPD frame, standing for Curator of Prints and Drawings, but the name <b>Metal</b> <b>Section</b> Frame ended up being used.|$|R
