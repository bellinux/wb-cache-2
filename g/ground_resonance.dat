25|$|When {{improvements}} in helicopters made them practical, autogyros became largely neglected. Also, they were susceptible to <b>ground</b> <b>resonance.</b> They were, however, {{used in the}} 1930s by major newspapers, and by the United States Postal Service for the mail service between the Camden, New Jersey airport {{and the top of}} the post office building in downtown Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.|$|E
25|$|The first Type 173 Mk 1 {{registered}} G-ALBN {{made its}} first hovering flight on 3 January 1952 but it tended to fly backwards. After landing from a second hovering flight <b>ground</b> <b>resonance</b> developed. Modifications to the aircraft to correct these failures delayed the first flight out of the hover, which occurred on 24 August 1952. During 1953 it was evaluated by the Royal Air Force (using serial number XF785) and also carried out sea trials for the Royal Navy on the aircraft carrier HMS Eagle. To overcome resonance in the fuselage it was later fitted with four-bladed rotors.|$|E

25|$|During March 1953, the Blackburn Bombardier-engined Skeeter Mark 3B was {{transferred}} to the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A). Subsequent testing showed that these aircraft continued to be underpowered and that the previously encountered <b>ground</b> <b>resonance</b> problems had yet to be properly resolved; these failings were cited as the reason for official support for the rotorcraft being suspended. In response to the suspension, Saunders-Roe chose to undertake a lengthy series of company-funded tests, which involved the use of a specially-built rig as well as more theoretical work being performed, for the purpose of identifying both the causes of and solutions to the resonance issue.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, a {{solution}} for the Skeeter's troublesome resonance issue had been developed, which involved {{the adoption of a}} redesigned undercarriage and the fitting of revised blade friction dampers on the rotor head. These improvements allowed Saunders-Roe to finally demonstrate that the <b>ground</b> <b>resonance</b> problems had been fixed when the Skeeter Mark 5 underwent testing by the A in March 1954. The resolution of the issue served to reignite official interest in the rotorcraft, quickly leading to a smaller order being placed for four Skeeter Mark 6s, each equipped with 200hp (149kW) Gipsy Major 200 engines (designated as AOP.10 and T.11 by the British armed forces), for evaluation purposes.|$|E
25|$|On 20 October 1949, {{the larger}} Skeeter Mark 2 {{performed}} its first flight. Powered tests using the rotorcraft soon made it {{apparent that the}} Mark 2 suffered from severe <b>ground</b> <b>resonance</b> problems. Cierva {{found it difficult to}} resolve these issues; on 26 June 1950, the Skeeter Mark 2 was destroyed during ground testing. Despite these problems, Cierva had received an order from the British Ministry of Supply for three improved Skeeters, a pair of Mark 3s and a single Mark 4, for evaluation purposes by the Royal Air Force (RAF) and Royal Navy. Prior to the completion of any of these three rotorcraft, rival manufacturer Saunders-Roe completed its take over of Cierva and took control of its facilities and development programmes in January 1951.|$|E

25|$|Following {{this initial}} evaluation, {{a number of}} {{modifications}} were incorporated into the design. These included increasing engine power by use of an Astazou XVIIIA of 780kW (1,050hp), and replacement of the original rotor blades with plastic blades. Aérospatiale engineers hoped to reduce vibration and <b>ground</b> <b>resonance.</b> Thus modified, test flights resumed in May 1973, in time to present the new aircraft at that year's Paris Air Show. In the meantime, a second prototype (registration F-WSQX) joined the test programme, flying first on 29 January. At the show, the first prototype broke three world airspeed records for helicopters in the 1,750kg – 3,000kg class (FAI class E-1d). Piloted by Roland Coffignot and carrying a dummy payload to represent eight passengers, it broke the 100km closed-circuit (299km/h, 186mph), 3km straight-course (312km/h, 195mph), and 15km straight-course (303km/h, 189mph) records.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were many}} demonstrations of the Ultra-light's {{capabilities}} performed at airshows, during military exercises and at sea, including a deployment aboard the U-class destroyer [...] However, the British Army {{had become more}} focused on the Saunders-Roe Skeeter and addressing that rotorcraft's shortcomings, such as <b>ground</b> <b>resonance</b> and engine issues. According to Wood, the rival Skeeter had made a good early impression in Germany and had attracted the offer of a military order for the type from the German government, but that this was {{on the condition that}} the Skeeter was in turn adopted by the British armed forces as well. Thus, the decision was taken in Whitehall to concentrate on the Skeeter, effectively abandoning the Ministry requirement that the Ultra-light was being developed towards meeting.|$|E
50|$|Proper {{maintenance}} of the helicopter's damping system components can prevent <b>ground</b> <b>resonance</b> from taking hold. When it does occur, recovery is often possible if action is taken quickly. If sufficient rotor RPM exists, immediate takeoff can restore rotor balance by allowing the airframe to freely move and help dampen the oscillation. If rotor RPM is very low during a <b>ground</b> <b>resonance</b> incident, complete shutdown may be sufficient.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} losses for {{electrical}} interconnections in VLSI packaging environments {{have been investigated}} in terms of attenuation, dispersion, propagation delay, reflection, crosstalk, overshoot/undershoot and <b>ground</b> noise <b>resonance.</b> Three types of loss are considered here; they are conductor loss (due to either DC loss or skin effect loss), dielectric loss and insertion loss. The {{advantages and disadvantages of}} either conductor loss or dielectric loss in signal propagation are examined. The model for <b>ground</b> noise <b>resonance</b> effect in nonuniformly coupled ribbon cables is first introduced, and then one of the more practical solutions to this problem is demonstrated by applying insertion loss to the cables at the resonant frequency.
