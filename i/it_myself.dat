500|$|David Hinckley of the New York Daily News {{noted that}} the complex storyline and darker themes seen in [...] "A Canterlot Wedding" [...] would make it appeal just as well to older viewers, and made the episode also feel {{relatively}} ambitious for a children's show. Hinckley and Michelle Profis of Entertainment Weekly {{noted that the}} episode's timing was also close to the one-year anniversary of the royal wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton. Entertainment Weekly writer Hilary Busis, reporting about the [...] "invitation" [...] that appeared in The New York Times to promote the episode, noted that [...] "Having seen <b>it</b> <b>myself,</b> I can concur; the hour-long special is ambitious, absorbing, and thoroughly entertaining, even to those who stopped playing with My Little Ponies back in the mid-'80s.

500|$|At the {{congress}} in Palermo in May 1893 where the union of all the Fasci in Sicily was decided, Maria Cammarata, of the Fascio of Piana, urged the audience to ensure the registration of women. The presence and political sophistication of the female representatives at {{the congress}} surprised the editor of [...] the Giornale di Sicilia: [...] "I could not believe <b>it</b> <b>myself.</b> They spoke loudly and clearly, with ease and astonishing courage." [...] One {{of the most prominent}} women was Marietta De Felice Giuffrida, the daughter of Giuseppe de Felice Giuffrida – {{one of the founders of}} the movement. Only 14 years old, she accompanied her father throughout Sicily to help him setting up Fasci in the interior. She was [...] "extraordinarily animated by the spirit of socialism, who spoke to the people with a fervour of a missionary, and because of her sex and age, she commanded the fascination of the masses." ...|$|E
500|$|Bowie {{agreed to}} what {{at the time}} was {{considered}} a controversial commercial sponsorship agreement with PepsiCo, which was later seen as helping {{to pave the way for}} other big money tours by other artists. For his part, Bowie recorded a TV commercial with Tina Turner to the tune [...] "Modern Love" [...] in May 1987 while he was preparing for the tour. The commercial had a short run, as Pepsi withdrew the commercial after Bowie was accused of sexual assault during the tour. Of the sponsorship agreement, Bowie said, [...] "We did a commercial sponsorship thing only for North America with the Pepsi-Cola company. As far as I'm concerned, what it's allowed me to do, having them underwrite the tour, is to be able to produce a far more extravagant show than if I were just doing <b>it</b> <b>myself.</b> It means that instead of just having 1 or 2 sets I can have 3 or 4 sets made, and they can travel independently and they can be far more complicated." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{assuming}} power, Khrushchev {{allowed a}} modest amount {{of freedom in}} the arts. Vladimir Dudintsev's Not by Bread Alone, about an idealistic engineer opposed by rigid bureaucrats, was allowed {{to be published in}} 1956, though Khrushchev called the novel [...] "false at its base". In 1958, however, Khrushchev ordered a fierce attack on Boris Pasternak after his novel Doctor Zhivago was published abroad (he was denied permission to publish it in the Soviet Union). Pravda described the novel as [...] "low-grade reactionary hackwork", and the author was expelled from the Writer's Union. To make things worse (from Khrushchev's perspective), Pasternak was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, which, under heavy pressure, he declined. Once he did so, Khrushchev ordered a halt to the attacks on Pasternak. In his memoirs, Khrushchev stated that he agonized over the novel, very nearly allowed it to be published, and later regretted not doing so. After his fall from power, Khrushchev obtained a copy of the novel and read it (he had earlier read only excerpts) and stated, [...] "We shouldn't have banned it. I should have read <b>it</b> <b>myself.</b> There's nothing anti-Soviet in it." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 2007, Lukashenko {{was accused}} of making anti-Semitic and anti-Israel comments; {{addressing}} the [...] "miserable state {{of the city of}} Babruysk" [...] on a live broadcast on state radio, he stated: [...] "This is a Jewish city, and the Jews are not concerned for the place they live in. They have turned Babruysk into a pigsty. Look at Israel – I was there and saw <b>it</b> <b>myself</b> ... I call on Jews who have money to come back to Babruysk." [...] Members of the US House of Representatives {{sent a letter to the}} Belarusian ambassador to the US, Mikhail Khvostov, addressing Lukashenko's comments with a strong request to retract them, and the comments also caused a negative reaction from Israel. Consequently, Pavel Yakubovich, editor of Belarus Today, was sent to Israel, and in a meeting with the Israel Foreign Ministry said that Lukashenko's comment was [...] "a mistake that was said jokingly, and does not represent his positions regarding the Jewish people" [...] and that he was [...] "anything but anti-Semitic," [...] and had been [...] "insulted by the mere accusation." [...] The Belarusian Ambassador to Israel, Igor Leshchenya, stated that the president had a [...] "kind attitude toward the Jewish people", and Sergei Rychenko, the press secretary at the Belarusian Embassy in Tel Aviv, said parts of Lukashenko's comments had been mistranslated.|$|E
500|$|Nichols {{was cast}} as Shana [...] "Scarlett" [...] O'Hara in the live-action film {{adaptation}} of the G.I. Joe franchise [...] (2009) in late 2007. She later said that she accepted director Stephen Sommers' offer for the role without having read the actual script. [...] "I'd heard from other people that the script was quite good. And then when I finally got to read <b>it</b> <b>myself...</b> I really, really liked it... I liked {{that there were two}} kick-ass female roles. And I liked the fact that it wasn't just a big action movie... And there was comedy in it. I was genuinely really happily surprised when I read the script." [...] She put on approximately [...] of muscle for the role and trained in mixed martial arts with co-star Sienna Miller for some of the film's action sequences. Nichols was burned by a flame during the filming of a fight scene with Miller. Like The Amityville Horror, G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra was not well received by most critics, but performed well at the box office. Richard Corliss of Time wrote that Nichols had [...] "an appealing manner and comely biceps" [...] as Scarlett O'Hara and took notice of her [...] "savory girl fight with Sienna Miller, as the mostly villainous Baroness." [...] After G.I. Joe, Nichols' next project was the horror film For Sale by Owner, where she played Anna Farrier. Going straight-to-video on October 27, 2009, the movie went largely unnoticed by critics and audiences alike.|$|E

2500|$|Samizdat (...) {{was a key}} form of {{dissident}} activity {{across the}} Soviet bloc in which individuals reproduced censored and underground publications by hand and passed the documents from reader to reader. This grassroots practice to evade official Soviet censorship was fraught with danger, as harsh punishments were meted out to people caught possessing or copying censored materials. Vladimir Bukovsky summarized it as follows: [...] "Samizdat: I write <b>it</b> <b>myself,</b> edit <b>it</b> <b>myself,</b> censor <b>it</b> <b>myself,</b> publish <b>it</b> <b>myself,</b> distribute <b>it</b> <b>myself,</b> and spend jail time for it myself." ...|$|E

2500|$|The soundtrack for Days of Heaven is {{a strong}} {{reflection}} of the film's context. Ennio Morricone provided the film's score and received his first Academy Award nomination in his soundtrack composing career {{for his work on}} the film. Morricone recalled the process as being [...] "demanding" [...] and said of Malick: [...] "He didn't know me very well, so he made suggestions, and in some cases, gave musical solutions. This kind of annoyed me because he'd say: 'This thing [...] [...] [...] try it with three flutes.' Something impossible! So, to humor him, I would do it with three flutes and then he'd decide to use my version after all.

Like her {{character}} in Annie Hall, Keaton had long relished photography as a favorite hobby, an interest she picked up as a teenager from her mother. While traveling in the late 1970s, she began exploring her avocation more seriously. [...] "Rolling Stone {{had asked me to}} take photographs for them, and I thought, 'Wait a minute, what I'm really interested in is these lobbies, and these strange ballrooms in these old hotels.' So I began shooting them", she recalled in 2003. [...] "These places were deserted, and I could just sneak in anytime and nobody cared.

2500|$|The Han Jin Chunqiu (漢晉春秋) by Xi Zuochi (習鑿齒) further {{described}} this uncanny friendship between Lu Kang and Yang Hu. After returning to Jin, Yang Hu started promoting morality and civility, and many Wu citizens {{were impressed with}} him. Lu Kang told the Wu forces stationed at the Wu-Jin border, [...] "If they govern with virtue and we administer our state like tyrants, we'll lose the war without even having to fight. I hope that you can guard the border well and not stir up problems over trivial matters." [...] The Wu-Jin border experienced peace and stability as both sides actively practised détente and got along harmoniously with each other. If cattle from one side accidentally strayed across the border, the other side would allow the owners {{to cross the border}} and retrieve their cattle. During hunting expeditions in the Mian (沔) area at the border, if the citizens of either side were injured, the other would send them home safely. When Lu Kang fell sick, he asked for medicine from Yang Hu. Yang Hu obliged and said, [...] "This medicine is of fine quality. I prepared <b>it</b> <b>myself.</b> I haven't tried <b>it</b> <b>myself</b> when I heard that you're ill so I sent it to you." [...] Lu Kang's subordinates cautioned him against taking Yang Hu's medicine because they were worried that Yang might harm him, but Lu ignored them. When the Wu emperor Sun Hao received news of peaceful relations between Wu and Jin, he sent a messenger to reprimand Lu Kang, but Lu replied, [...] "Ordinary peasants in the countryside have to keep their promises, much less me, a government official. If I do not live the virtues, I will appear as a stark contrast to Yang Hu. This does not result in any harm to Yang Hu." [...] However, there were some who disagreed with the behaviour of Lu Kang and Yang Hu, as they believed that Lu and Yang were not fulfilling their loyalties to their respective states.|$|E
2500|$|Owing to {{the success}} of [...] "The Sign of the Rose," [...] Beban was cast for most of the next decade in Italian {{character}} roles. [...] In 1917, Beban revealed to a reporter the irony that he could not speak a word of Italian. [...] Beban explained:"I understand the tongue when it is spoken – I couldn't be associated with it for so many years and not recognize and translate it – but I have never attempted to talk <b>it</b> <b>myself.</b> ... To portray the type of Italian that I do all one needs is knowledge of the actions, mannerisms, etc., of the character.

[...] In other words, I Americanize him for the United States consumption – stage purposes." ...|$|E
