25|$|Human {{beings are}} aware and {{are aware of}} being aware - i.e., they are conscious. <b>Human</b> <b>consciousness</b> always {{includes}} an awareness of oneself {{in the context of}} other people.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} peace without weapons {{is as old}} as {{philosophy}} and <b>human</b> <b>consciousness.</b> This theory holds that weapons per se are a threat to peace, and a removal of all weapons is the way to everlasting peace.|$|E
50|$|The most {{well-known}} method for testing machine intelligence is the Turing test. But when interpreted as only observational, this test contradicts {{the philosophy of}} science principles of theory dependence of observations. It also {{has been suggested that}} Alan Turing's recommendation of imitating not a <b>human</b> adult <b>consciousness,</b> but a <b>human</b> child <b>consciousness,</b> should be taken seriously.|$|R
50|$|The Shadow King's origins are unclear. It is a multiversal {{manifestation of}} {{the dark side of}} the <b>human</b> <b>consciousnesses,</b> spawned by the first nightmare. When Amahl Farouk's powers {{developed}} he psychically controlled those around him, feeding on the shadows in their souls and merging with the Shadow King (who had transferred from host to host since the dawn of humanity).|$|R
25|$|Animal consciousness, {{or animal}} awareness, {{is the quality}} or state of {{self-awareness}} within an animal, or of being aware of an external object or something within itself. In <b>humans,</b> <b>consciousness</b> has been defined as: sentience, awareness, subjectivity, qualia, the ability to experience or to feel, wakefulness, having a sense of selfhood, and the executive control system of the mind. Despite the difficulty in definition, many philosophers {{believe there is a}} broadly shared underlying intuition about what consciousness is.|$|R

25|$|Wes Burgess is a psychiatrist, scientist, {{and author}} {{who has written}} books, book chapters, and over 100 {{scholarly}} articles on psychiatry, psychology, animal behavior (ethology), nonverbal communication, and <b>human</b> <b>consciousness.</b> His main contribution {{has been to the}} understanding of the mind and social relationships.|$|E
25|$|The idea of Buddha-nature {{originated}} in India, and was further developed in China, {{due to the}} different culture Buddhism had to adapt to. It {{was the result of}} an interplay between various strands of Buddhist thought, on the nature of <b>human</b> <b>consciousness</b> and the means of awakening.|$|E
40|$|In <b>humans,</b> <b>consciousness</b> is {{a process}} taking place on the neocortex. I argue that from an information-processing {{perspective}} this process is, among other things, distributed selection of useful information. I review simulation results from a computer model of the process. The model is able to learn abstract categories and invariant features in an unsupervised manner. It is also able to segment out individual objects and switch between different objects. Object representations emerge from subsymbolic representations. 1...|$|R

50|$|According to Ahmed Hulusi the Dajjal {{is not an}} {{external}} entity, rather he descripes {{a part of the}} human mind. The Day of Resurrection is not a global event, but something, that each person will experience for themselves. Therefore the Dajjal is the part of <b>humans</b> <b>consciousness,</b> which claims to be God. Then a human trust his inner Dajjal, he believes to be his physical body and an independend self, leading to bodily desires. Living in believing to be the physical form, is associated with the heaven of Dajjal, which is actually hell, as it was stated by Muhammed.|$|R
25|$|The Talos Principle is a narrative-based puzzle game, played from a first- or third-person perspective. The player {{takes the}} role of a robot with a {{seemingly}} <b>human</b> <b>consciousness</b> as they explore a number of environments that include over 120 puzzles. These environments interlock greenery, desert, and stone ruins with futuristic technology.|$|E
25|$|Benigni began North American {{presentations of}} TuttoDante with an {{announcement}} {{that he learned}} English to bring the gift of Dante's work to English speakers. The English performance incorporates dialectic discussion of language and verse and is a celebration of modernity {{and the concept of}} <b>human</b> <b>consciousness</b> as created by language.|$|E
25|$|Humanistic psychologists {{generally}} {{do not believe that}} we will understand <b>human</b> <b>consciousness</b> and behavior through Cartesian-Newtonian scientific research. The objection that humanistic psychologists have to traditional research methods is that they are derived from and suited for the physical sciences and not especially appropriate to studying the complexities and nuances of human meaning-making.|$|E
50|$|Playwright William Goodhart was {{commissioned}} {{to write the}} screenplay, titled The Heretic; he based it around the theories of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (the Jesuit paleontologist/archaeologist who had inspired the character of Father Merrin in Blatty's novel The Exorcist). Goodhart's screenplay took a more metaphysical and intellectual approach compared with the original film. Here, the battle {{between good and evil}} would centre around human consciousness—with the specific idea that, within the framework of Catholic theology, <b>human</b> <b>consciousnesses</b> could be brought together as one through technology, although this would also result in conflict between those who sought good and evil.|$|R

25|$|If an AI system {{replicates}} all key {{aspects of}} human intelligence, will that system also be sentient – will it have a mind which has conscious experiences? This question {{is closely related to}} the philosophical problem as to the nature of <b>human</b> <b>consciousness,</b> generally referred to as the hard problem of consciousness.|$|E
25|$|The goal of Sikhism {{is to be}} {{one with}} God. Sikhs meditate {{as a means to}} {{progress}} towards enlightenment; it is devoted meditation simran that enables a sort of communication between the Infinite and finite <b>human</b> <b>consciousness.</b> There is no concentration on the breath but chiefly the remembrance of God through the recitation of the name of God and surrender themselves to Gods presence often metaphorized as surrendering themselves to the Lord's feet.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the quality}} of Atma is {{primarily}} consciousness, all sentient and insentient beings are pervaded by Atma, including plants, animals, humans and gods. The difference between them is the contracted or expanded state of that consciousness. For example, animals and humans share in common the desire to live, fear of death, desire to procreate and to protect their families and territory {{and the need for}} sleep, but animals' consciousness is more contracted and has less possibility to expand than does <b>human</b> <b>consciousness.</b>|$|E

25|$|MUM is {{reported}} to be the only university in the U.S. that offers a PhD degree in the Neuroscience of <b>Human</b> <b>Consciousness.</b> The university participates in a state-sponsored, fast-track license program for school teachers. MUM also offers a BA in Communications and Media with options for video and audio production, graphic and web design, and professional creative writing. Students and recent graduates have won awards for their work at the Iowa Motion Pictures Association Awards, the Cedar Rapids Independent Film Festival, and the Webby Awards.|$|E
25|$|Cognitive binding is {{associated}} with the different states of <b>human</b> <b>consciousness.</b> Two of the most studied states of consciousness are the wakefulness and REM sleep. There have been multiple studies showing, electrophysiologically, that these two states are quite similar in nature. This has led some neural binding theorists to study the modes of cognitive awareness in each state. Certain observations have even led these scientists to hypothesize that since there is little cognition going on during REM sleep, the increased thalamocortical responses show the action of processing in the waking preconscious.|$|E

The orbit of the new planet is gigantic, never coming closer to the Sun than 30. 5 billion kilometers. The discovery of planets whose orbits go beyond Pluto is not new. We know Sedna, Haumea and Makemake, and also Eris, which is more massive than Pluto. But all these planets have much less mass than the giant planet that was recently found orbiting our sun. Here we show how massive planets like these can affect the <b>human</b> <b>consciousnesses,</b> when they approach the Sun, and pass nearby the Earth...|$|R
5000|$|In the {{television}} series Caprica (2009-2010), a prequel to Battlestar Galactica, {{the ability to}} upload <b>human</b> <b>consciousnesses</b> into a virtual reality world is featured prominently. (Battlestar Galactica did not itself feature true mind uploading, since the cylons were artificial intelligences that were not based on ordinary human brains, though their minds could be transferred from one body to another {{in the same manner}} as is often envisioned for uploads.) While some characters believe that the process only creates an imperfect copy of the original person, as the death of the original consciousness is unnecessary for the creation of the virtual copy, other characters believe that it can be viewed as a form of religious rebirth analogous to the afterlife.|$|R

25|$|Some {{strands of}} {{computer}} vision research {{are closely related}} to the study of biological vision – indeed, just as many strands of AI research are closely tied with research into <b>human</b> <b>consciousness,</b> and the use of stored knowledge to interpret, integrate and utilize visual information. The field of biological vision studies and models the physiological processes behind visual perception in humans and other animals. Computer vision, on the other hand, studies and describes the processes implemented in software and hardware behind artificial vision systems. Interdisciplinary exchange between biological and computer vision has proven fruitful for both fields.|$|E
25|$|By 1960 Christopher Hills had {{accumulated}} a large metaphysical library on frequent trips to Samuel Weiser Books in New York, while writing his own books, Kingdom of Desire, Power of the Doctrine and The Power of Increased Perception. At 30 {{he retired from}} business and began to research multiple spiritual paths and the physics of what Einstein called Unified field theory. Prolific research papers and lectures came out of Hills' laboratory in the Blue Mountains (Jamaica) on subjects such as bioenergetics, hypnosis, tele-thought, biophysics, effects of solar radiation on living organisms, resonant systems of ionosphere, and capacitor effects of human body on static electricity and electron discharge of the nervous system. In 1960 he began a 30-year project to document the effects of sound and color on <b>human</b> <b>consciousness</b> and states of health.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{enduring}} literary themes connected with the figure of Circe was her ability to change men into animals. There was much speculation concerning how this could be, whether the <b>human</b> <b>consciousness</b> changed at the same time, and even {{whether it was a}} change for the better. In the first century CE, Plutarch took up the theme in a lively dialogue that was later to have several imitators. Contained in his Moralia is the Gryllus episode in which Circe allows Odysseus to interview a fellow Greek turned into a pig. There his interlocutor informs Odysseus that his present existence is preferable to the human. They then engage in a philosophical dialogue in which every human value is questioned and beasts are proved to be of superior wisdom and virtue.|$|E
