25|$|Most surveys {{indicate}} that while blacks tend to vote Democratic in elections, members of traditionally African-American churches {{are generally more}} socially conservative than white Protestants as a whole. Same-sex marriage and other LGBT issues {{have been among the}} leading causes for activism in some black churches, though a majority of black Protestants remain opposed to this stance. Nevertheless, some denominations <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discussing</b> this issue. For example, the African Methodist Episcopal Church prohibits its ministers from officiating same-sex weddings, but it does not have a clear policy on ordination.|$|E
25|$|Folk {{religious}} sects {{began to}} rapidly revive in mainland China in the 1980s, and now if conceptualised {{as a single}} group {{they are said to}} have the same number of followers of the five state-sanctioned religions of China taken together. Scholars and government officials <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discussing</b> to systematise and unify this large base of religious organisations; in 2004 the State Administration of Religious Affairs created a department for the management of folk religions. In the late 2015 a step was made at least for those of them with a Confucian identity, with the foundation of the Holy Confucian Church of China which aims to unite in a single body all Confucian religious groups.|$|E

In the first chapter, the theoretical aspect of the CPSE & their employment, remuneration and VRS policy <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discussed.</b> In the second chapter, the remuneration policies for executives of the CPSEs <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discussed.</b> For this, {{the recommendations of the}} first and second Pay Revision Committee (basis of determining remuneration for executives of the CPSEs) <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discussed</b> along with some suggestions for a better implementation. In the third chapter, the employment trend including recruitment and retirement trend of the executive <b>have</b> <b>been</b> analyzed both aggregate and sector wise. During the analysis, some observations <b>were</b> made which <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discussed.</b> In the fourth chapter, an analysis <b>has</b> <b>been</b> done regarding VRS in the CPSEs at the executive level. By using regression line, a relationship between the surplus manpower and VRS <b>have</b> <b>been</b> found which <b>have</b> <b>been</b> also <b>discussed</b> in detail.
