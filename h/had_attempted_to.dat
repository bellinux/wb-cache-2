Gabe must set aside the hunt for Phagan to destroy Rhoemer's base in Kazakhstan. During his assignment, Rhoemer seemingly kills Lian, but Agency Director Thomas Markinson rescues Gabe.|$|E
40|$|In {{dealing with}} the {{individual}} works, I <b>have</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> analyze the structural element first, and then to deduce the novel's meaning, or theme, making use, wherever it is possible, {{of the results of}} the analysis of structure. In addition, I <b>have</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> reveal the development of certain themes from one novel to another, and certain developments in characterization and general design. I <b>have</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> reveal the relationship of the structure and thematic aspects of the individual works to Fizgerald's work as a whole. Finally, I <b>have</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> demonstrate Fitzgerald's relationship with certain of this peers and forebears in the American novel...|$|R

5|$|Captain Glušica {{was given}} {{clearance}} to land, however, he suddenly aborted the attempted landing. The aircraft's throttle handle {{was found in}} the forward position, suggesting that the pilot <b>had</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> abort the landing and take off again. The co-pilot Ahluwalia had warned his commander three times to go around instead of landing; the first of these warnings had come 2.5 miles before the runway threshold.|$|E
5|$|Hines told a {{journalist}} in June 1939 {{that he was}} seeking to join the Militia and hoped to fight in another war. He attempted to enlist in the military during World War II, despite being in his 60s, but was rejected. An article published in The Nepean Times during 1943 claimed that Hines <b>had</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> stow away on a troop ship in 1940, but was found and sent ashore before the vessel sailed.|$|E

In addition, Albert T. White, Commanding Officer of the LNG, was 'rusticated' by Tubman to become the Superindendent of Grand Gedeh in 1966, though he was later 'rehabilitated'.|$|E
5|$|Lin trademarked {{the word}} Linsanity in 2012 to preempt strangers from {{profiting}} from his likeness. Two others <b>had</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> trademark {{the term in}} the first week of February, but the United States Patent and Trademark Office ultimately registered the term to Lin. A documentary film about Lin, titled Linsanity, premiered on January 20, 2013, at the Sundance Film Festival. It was shown at numerous film festivals before making its way into art houses.|$|E
5|$|Mézières {{had been}} fascinated by the American Old West {{since he was a}} little boy through {{exposure}} to Western genre films starring the likes of Gary Cooper, Burt Lancaster and James Stewart and comics such as Lucky Luke and Jerry Spring.

5|$|Scandal erupted when Teller (and his {{associate}} Lowell Wood) {{were accused}} of deliberately overselling the program and perhaps had encouraged the dismissal of a laboratory director (Roy Woodruff) who <b>had</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> correct the error. His claims led to a joke which circulated in the scientific community, that a new unit of unfounded optimism was designated as the teller; one teller was so large that most events had to be measured in nanotellers or picotellers.|$|E
5|$|The {{action would}} prove {{controversial}} in the United States as several officers' reports suggested that Lieutenant Maley, commander of Experiment, had shown cowardice during the engagement. Lieutenant Porter stated that Maley {{had tried to}} insist on surrendering to the picaroons immediately upon their arrival. It was alleged that Maley thought the situation was hopeless due to {{the sheer number of}} pro-French Haitians who were attacking the convoy, and he <b>had</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> strike the colors.|$|E
5|$|The crusaders <b>had</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> {{negotiate}} with the Fatimids during their march to Jerusalem, but to no avail.

5|$|A {{flashback}} {{reveals that}} Ponnar and Sankar are actually Thamarai's sons and that Rakki, {{who was then}} a servant of Nellaiyankondan, had saved the twins as small children from Mandhiyappan. Mandhiyappan <b>had</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> avenge himself on Thamarai for rejecting his hand in marriage. He learns that the twins are still alive and hatches a conspiracy to kill them. He tricks Kali Mannan (Napoleon) and Thamarai's father into helping him. This leads to an intense battle which ends with good prevailing over evil.|$|E
5|$|After the 1976 tour, Townshend took {{most of the}} {{following}} year off {{to spend time with}} his family. He discovered that former Beatles and Rolling Stones manager Allen Klein had bought a stake in his publishing company. A settlement was reached, but Townshend was upset and disillusioned that Klein <b>had</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> take ownership of his songs. Townshend went to the Speakeasy where he met the Sex Pistols' Steve Jones and Paul Cook, fans of the Who. After leaving, he passed out in a doorway, where a policeman said he would not be arrested if he could stand and walk. The events inspired the title track of the next album, Who Are You.|$|E
5|$|Also {{exceptionally}} challenging will be {{the movement}} and destruction of deadly agents such as sarin, VX nerve agents and mustard agent during the civil war. The chemical weapons convention disallows movement of such deadly agents outside the country holding them, but Security Council Resolution 2118 allows extraordinary measures {{to be taken in}} Syria. Some of the chemicals will need to be transported along the highway between Damascus and Homs, which is still contested as of December 2013. Syria has requested the international community provide armored vehicles to assist in safe transport of the chemicals. In February 2014, Syria stated that rebels <b>had</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> attack two convoys transporting chemical weapons.|$|E

5|$|Another {{cause of}} revulsion against Webster was her attempt to {{impersonate}} Thomas. She {{had managed to}} perpetrate the impersonation for two weeks, implying that middle-class identity amounted {{to little more than}} cultivating the right demeanour and having the appropriate clothes and possessions, whether or not they had been earned. John Church, the publican whom Webster <b>had</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> implicate, was himself a former servant who had risen to lower middle-class status and earned a measure of prosperity and effective management of his pub. His commitment to bettering himself through hard work was in keeping with the ethic of the time. Webster, in contrast, had simply stolen her briefly-held middle-class identity.|$|E
5|$|At 04:40, HMAS Canberra {{recorded}} {{that the}} Japanese may have fired torpedoes at her. This {{may have been}} one of many false alarms throughout the night. However, M-21 <b>had</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> fire its two torpedoes, but failed because of damage to the bow either from HMAS Yandras ramming or depth charges, or a possible collision with USS Chicago, making it possible that M-21 attempted to attack the cruiser. The observer aboard Canberra may have seen bubbles from the compressed air released to fire the torpedoes.|$|E
5|$|Beattie and {{his team}} had noticed that someone else <b>had</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> exhume Hartnell.

A month later, Edward A. Inglefield, commander of another rescue expedition, succeeded with the exhumation and removed the coffin plaque.|$|E
