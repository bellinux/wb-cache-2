500|$|Beginning in the mid-1970s, Roosevelt Island was redeveloped to {{accommodate}} low- to mid-income housing projects. However, {{there was no}} <b>direct</b> <b>transit</b> connection to Manhattan. The subway was delayed and still under construction; trolley tracks that formerly served Roosevelt Island via the Queensboro Bridge were unusable; {{and the only way}} on and off the island was via the Roosevelt Island Bridge to Queens. A tram route, the Roosevelt Island Tramway, was opened in May 1976 as a [...] "temporary" [...] connection to Manhattan. The Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation was formed in 1984 to develop the island, but was not successful until October 1989 when the subway station opened {{along with the rest of}} the 63rd Street Line. After that, a high-rise luxury apartment building with some subsidized housing opened.|$|E

2500|$|A ferry is a boat used {{to carry}} (or ferry) passengers, and {{sometimes}} their vehicles, across a body of water. A [...] ferry with many stops is sometimes called a water bus. Ferries form {{a part of the}} public transport systems of many waterside cities and islands, allowing <b>direct</b> <b>transit</b> between points at a capital cost much lower than bridges or tunnels, though at a lower speed. Ship connections of much larger distances (such as over long distances in water bodies like the Mediterranean Sea) may also be called ferry services.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, then-mayor Thomas Menino {{proposed}} ferry service between East Boston and Fan Pier on the South Boston Waterfront, a route {{without current}} <b>direct</b> <b>transit</b> service. In August 2012, the Federal Highway Administration awarded $1.28 {{million to the}} city for the purchase of two boats. In September 2012, the Boston Redevelopment Authority accepted the grant and agreed to rehabilitate the East Boston Marine Terminal for the ferries, which were then expected to begin operation in 2013. In August 2014, the MBTA opened bidding for providing the two boats for East Boston service. Bidding is expected to close on September 10, 2014.|$|E
2500|$|As the {{extractive}} {{industries of}} West Fife developed, {{increasing numbers of}} pits needed a railway connection, and on 14 July 1856 the West of Fife Mineral Railway was authorised, to build a line between Dunfermline and Killairnie, {{on the way to}} Saline. Good quality blackband ironstone and limestone were known to be available as well as coal. The Dunfermline starting point was to be at or near the Elgin Railway Junction (which became Whitemyre Junction), and the termination was to be [...] "at a Point in a Field or Enclosure on the Estate of Killairnie, adjoining the Junction of the Turnpike Road from Redcraigs to Saline, with the New Road leading there from to North Steelend". There was to be a branch to Kingseat. Authorised capital was £45,000, and passenger operation had been mentioned in the prospectus and was authorised in the Act, although passengers were never actually carried. It opened as far as Steelend on 25 June 1858. The opening of the West of Fife, which was a railway of standard gauge using modern wagons, offering <b>direct</b> <b>transit</b> onward to the main line network, changed the nature of the mineral lines in the area, and the old waggonway lines suffered.|$|E

2500|$|The current 1% {{sales tax}} {{was set to}} be reduced to 0.5% in 2032. In early 2007 MARTA made a request to the City of Atlanta, DeKalb County, and Fulton County to seek a 15-year {{extension}} of the 1% sales tax from 2032 to 2047, with a 0.5% sales tax from 2047 to 2057. This is {{the fourth time in}} its history that MARTA sought the extension, the most recent in 1990. MARTA said the commitment to the tax is needed for the agency to secure long-term financing in the form of bonds to pay for any future expansions to the system. The resolution called for four new routes: bus rapid transit from H.E. Holmes station to Fulton Industrial Boulevard, bus rapid transit from Garnett station to Stonecrest Mall, transit for the BeltLine, and a <b>direct</b> <b>transit</b> link from Lindbergh Center to Emory University (formerly called the [...] "C-Loop"). To approve the tax extension, two of the three government agencies needed to agree to the extension. In March 2007 the City of Atlanta voted 12-1 to approve the extension. [...] In April 2007 the DeKalb County Commission also approved the sales tax extension. [...] Some Fulton county officials opposed the sales tax extension on the basis that the proposed service expansions did not include previously proposed expansion of the North Rail line to Roswell and Alpharetta in North Fulton County.|$|E
