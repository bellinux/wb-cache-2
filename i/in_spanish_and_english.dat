25|$|The {{language}} was erroneously {{referred to as}} Kunkaak {{as early as the}} beginning of the twentieth century (as in Hernández 1904), and this mistake has been repeated up to the present day by people who confuse the name of an ethnic group with the name of its language (which are often the same <b>in</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>and</b> <b>English).</b> The lexeme Comcaac is used in the Seri language only to refer to the people.|$|E
500|$|In Spain, [...] 26 {{percent of}} the {{population}} supports Barcelona as their primary club, with another 7% supporting Barcelona while having another club as their primary. Throughout Europe many fans regard Barcelona as their second club. Since the 2003–04 season, the club's membership figures have risen from 100,000 to 170,000 socis in September 2009, a 70 percent increase. The sharp rise was attributed to the influence of Ronaldinho and then-president Joan Laporta's media-strategy, which focused on online media <b>in</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>and</b> <b>English.</b> As of June 2010 there are 1,335 officially registered penyes around the world, representing an 11 percent increase since 2003.|$|E

500|$|Farmers holding grain {{ingested}} it instead, {{since their}} own planting had been completed. Distribution was hurried and open, with grain being distributed {{free of charge}} or with payment in kind. Some farmers sold their own grain lest this new grain devalue what they had. This left them dependent on tainted grain for the winter. Many Iraqis were either unaware of the significant health risk posed, or chose to ignore the warnings. [...] Initially, farmers were to certify with a thumbprint or signature that they understood the grain was poison, but according to some sources, distributors {{did not ask for}} such an indication. Warnings on the sacks were <b>in</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>and</b> <b>English,</b> not at all understood, or included the black-and-white skull and crossbones design, which meant nothing to Iraqis. The long latent period may have granted farmers a false sense of security, when animals fed the grain appeared to be fine. The red dye washed off the grain; the mercury did not. Hence, washing may have given only the appearance of removing the poison.|$|E
500|$|Series E was {{introduced}} subsequently. The banknotes for this issue were bilingual, featuring the bank's name both <b>in</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>and</b> <b>English.</b> Early specimens for Series F were produced in 1907, {{but they never}} reached circulation. The bills for this issue featured the profiles of Christopher Columbus and Juan Ponce de León. The colonial government intended to eliminate all Spanish captions from these notes, intending to accelerate a failed [...] "Americanization" [...] process in Puerto Rico. Series F ultimately entered circulation on July 1, 1909, still featuring bilingual captions and exhibiting {{a higher degree of}} technical quality. In 1913, the charter granted by Spain expired and the bank was closed and its assets were liquidated. After this date, Puerto Rico's economy was fully integrated into the United States' currency system, while Puerto Rican dollars were redeemed for United States dollars. Banknotes valorized in millions continued in circulation, thus a collect was ordered and held between January 16 – 24, 1916. The remaining bills, with an estimated value of $14,872 were taken out of circulation nine years later by the Puerto Rico Commercial Bank.|$|E
500|$|For the album, Shakira wrote all the lyrics, and the {{majority}} of the music. [...] "To start seeing people's first reactions, and how people start relating to these songs and appreciating every single piece of work I have done over the past two years, is the best reward an artist can have after so much hard work," [...] says Shakira. [...] "I will not lie to you; it was not a path of roses. It was painful at times to come up with two albums, to write more than 60 songs and to fight my own insecurities and doubts." [...] While speaking about the difference about expressing herself <b>in</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>and</b> <b>English,</b> Shakira told, [...] "When I express myself in Spanish, I find elements that help me express an idea in perhaps a different way than when I do it in English. There are different aesthetics, but there is a certain style to the way I write my own songs, a particular way of describing feelings and emotions that I have developed over all these years making songs. I have gotten in touch with my own gift - I am sure, 10 years ago, I was not half as good as I can say I am today, and I am still not good enough. There is a long way to go." ...|$|E
