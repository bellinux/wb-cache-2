5|$|The first {{structure}} of an organic compound, <b>hexamethylenetetramine,</b> was solved in 1923. This {{was followed by}} several studies of long-chain fatty acids, which are {{an important component of}} biological membranes. In the 1930s, the structures of much larger molecules with two-dimensional complexity began to be solved. A significant advance was the {{structure of}} phthalocyanine, a large planar molecule that is closely related to porphyrin molecules important in biology, such as heme, corrin and chlorophyll.|$|E
25|$|A {{modified}} version of the P Helmet, called the PH Helmet, was issued in January 1916, and was additionally impregnated with <b>hexamethylenetetramine</b> to improve the protection against phosgene.|$|E
25|$|Ammonia {{can also}} be used to make {{compounds}} in reactions which are not specifically named.

25|$|RDX was {{reported}} in 1898 by Georg Friedrich Henning, who obtained a German patent (patent No. 104280) for its manufacture by nitrolysis of hexamine (<b>hexamethylenetetramine)</b> with concentrated nitric acid. In this patent, the medical properties of RDX were mentioned; however, three further German patents obtained by Henning in 1916 proposed its use in smokeless propellants. The German military started investigating its use in 1920, referring to it as hexogen. Research and development findings were not published further until Edmund von Herz, described as an Austrian and later a German citizen, obtained a British patent in 1921 and a United States patent in 1922. Both patent claims were initiated in Austria; and described the manufacture of RDX by nitrating <b>hexamethylenetetramine.</b> The British patent claims included the manufacture of RDX by nitration, its use with or without other explosives, and its use as a bursting charge and as an initiator. The US patent claim was {{for the use of}} a hollow explosive device containing RDX and a detonator cap containing RDX. In the 1930s, Germany developed improved production methods.|$|E
2500|$|Methylene blue is a {{component}} of a frequently prescribed urinary analgesic/anti-infective/anti-spasmodic known as [...] "Prosed DS", a combination of drugs which also contains phenyl salicylate, benzoic acid, hyoscyamine sulfate, and methenamine (aka <b>hexamethylenetetramine</b> {{and not to be}} confused with 'methanamine').|$|E
2500|$|By early 1941, the NDRC was researching new processes.

One mole of <b>hexamethylenetetramine</b> could produce at most one mole of RDX. At least three laboratories with no previous explosive experience were tasked to develop better production methods for RDX; they were based at Cornell, Michigan, and Penn State universities. Werner Emmanuel Bachmann, from Michigan, successfully developed the [...] "combination process" [...] by combining the Canadian process with direct nitration. The combination process required large quantities of acetic anhydride instead of nitric acid in the old British [...] "Woolwich process". Ideally, the combination process could produce two moles of RDX from each mole of <b>hexamethylenetetramine.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Many {{molecules}} adopt adamantane-like cage structures.

50|$|<b>Hexamethylenetetramine</b> {{was first}} {{introduced}} into the medical setting in 1899 as a urinary antiseptic. However, it was only used in cases of acidic urine, whereas boric acid was used to treat urinary tract infections with alkaline urine.

Therefore, its effectiveness as a drug depended greatly on the acidity of the urine rather than the amount of the drug administered. In an alkaline environment, <b>hexamethylenetetramine</b> was found to be almost completely inactive.|$|E
