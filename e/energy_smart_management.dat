This design methodology focuses on 1. <b>smart</b> <b>energy</b> <b>management</b> at runtime and 2. application-specific System-On-Chip (SoC) design at design time, contributing to low-power systems on both algorithmic and technology level. <b>Smart</b> <b>energy</b> <b>management</b> is performed spatially at runtime by a behaviour-based or state-action-driven selection from {{a set of}} different (implemented) algorithms classified by their demand of computation power, and temporally by varying data processing rates.

These signal flow graphs are mapped to Petri Nets to enable direct high-level synthesis of digital SoC circuits using a multi-process architecture with the Communicating-Sequential-Process model on execution level. Power analysis using simulation techniques on gate-level provides input for the algorithmic selection during runtime of the system, leading to a closed-loop design flow.
