25|$|The {{history of}} Málaga, {{shaped by the}} city's {{location}} {{in the south of}} Spain on the western shore of the Mediterranean Sea, spans about 2,800 years, making Málaga one of the oldest cities in the world. The first inhabitants to settle the site may have been the Bastetani, an ancient Iberian tribe. The Phoenicians founded the colony of Malaka <b>here</b> <b>about</b> 770 BC, and from the 6th century BC it was under the hegemony of ancient Carthage in north Africa. From 218 BC the city was ruled by the Roman Republic and then {{at the end of the}} 1st century during the reign of Domitian it was federated with the Roman Empire as Malaca (Latin). Thereafter it was governed under its own municipal code of law, the Lex Flavia Malacitana, which granted free-born persons the privileges of Roman citizenship.|$|E

25|$|It {{is thought}} that there was already a {{settlement}} at the confluence of the Mugnone with the River Arno between the 10th and the 8th century BC. Between the 7th and 6th centuries BC Etruscans had discovered and used the ford of the Arno near this confluence, closer to the hills of the North and South. A bridge or a ferry was probably constructed <b>here,</b> <b>about</b> ten metres away from the current Ponte Vecchio, but closer to the ford itself. The Etruscans, however, preferred not to build cities on the plain for reasons of defence and instead settled about six kilometres away on a hill. This settlement was a precursor of the fortified centre of Vipsul (today's Fiesole), which was later connected by road to all the major Etruscan centres of Emilia to the North and Lazio to the South.|$|E

The business was established in 1854 by Pabst & Krauss, who were pioneers in the trade <b>here.</b> <b>About</b> 16 years ago Mr. Pabst became sole proprietor. The premises are very spacious, admirably arranged, and equipped throughout with every facility and convenience for the transaction of business, employment being given to 25 skilled workmen. Mr. Pabst designs and manufactures art and antique furniture of all kinds, which, for beauty and originality of design, superior and elaborate finish are unexcelled.

It is so well known and has retained its old customers for so long a time, that its reputation for honorable, straightforward dealing is established beyond the requirements of praise.|$|E

There was a Romano-British village near the suburb of Holway, and Taunton was a place of considerable importance in Saxon times. The Saxon town was a burh with its own mint.

Hayden asked for money from Williamson, who agreed he would give it to him later in the evening. At this, Hayden attacked Williamson, stabbing him around seventy times.|$|E
500|$|Having {{no one to}} talk {{to about}} the issues that were {{consuming}} her, she decided to read as much as she could on the topic. She found very little, and much of what she found described homosexuals as [...] "deviants", [...] "perverts", and [...] "abnormal" [...] in medical books and texts on abnormal psychology, or odd generalizations that stated homosexuals were unable to whistle, or that their favorite color was green. She found all the information focused on homosexual men. [...] She recalled in a 2001 interview, [...] "I thought, this is not about me. There is nothing <b>here</b> <b>about</b> love or happiness.

After demonstrations took place at Queen's Park, the protesters flooded portions of College Street, Yonge Street, Queen Street and University Avenue for a march. The immediate demands of the protest were to call for an immediate permanent ceasefire, allow media and journalists into the warzone and to place diplomatic sanctions on Sri Lanka. The protesters also ran a food-drive, asking for non-perishable food items. David Miller attended the protest and remarked, [...] "some people would probably be offended by the flag and afraid to show their support for these people, but I'm not <b>here</b> <b>about</b> politics."

500|$|Francis {{received}} generally negative {{reviews for}} her portrayal. Jamey Giddens of Zap2it {{wrote of the}} decision to sign Francis onto the series: [...] "Maria Arena Bell just made Brian Frons kick a puppy in the face." [...] After her debut, he called Francis' portrayal of Genevieve [...] "embarrassingly-bad", stating: [...] "I'm sure I will catch hell for going <b>here</b> <b>about</b> a daytime treasure, but Francis' portrayal of Cane and Caleb's (Daniel Goddard) unhinged mother has been cartoonish and abysmal from her first air show. I don't know if Francis is painfully attempting to channel the late Elizabeth Taylor’s fun, campy turn as Luke and Laura's arch nemesis Helena Cassadine on General Hospital 30 years ago, or going for Evil-Lyn from the old He-Man and the Masters of the Universe cartoon, but she's missing the mark either way." [...] He also wrote that as much as he would [...] "love to solely blame this performance on the writing—because let’s face it, the story is dreadful—Francis is the one making the choices to jerk, gasp and wince as Genevieve registers each and every emotion or painful memory. This is not the Genie Francis we know and love." [...] Adam Hughes of Yahoo! wrote of viewers' reactions to Francis' debut and her portrayal, stating: [...] "Since Francis arrived on the scene this spring, fan reaction to her revised on-screen attitude has been a mixed bag, but she continues to draw a ton of interest to her new CBS television digs. Former General Hospital followers may find her more biting character hard to swallow, and longtime fans of The Young and The Restless have watched her push aside some of their favorites, but Francis has undoubtedly shaken up the local landscape. Buzz is half the game when comes to keeping soap opera fans interested, and Francis has certainly delivered that." ...|$|E
500|$|... 808s & Heartbreak is {{a radical}} {{departure}} from West's previous hip hop albums. According to 33⅓ writer Kirk Walker Graves, 808s & Heartbreak is an avant-garde electropop album. Rolling Stone magazine called it an [...] "introspective, synthpop album," [...] while The 405 described it as West's [...] "experimental pop record." [...] According to The Independent, West abandoned his customary hip hop sound in favor of sparse, drum machine-based electropop. Pitchforks Scott Plagenhoef also categorized the album as [...] "an introspective, minimal electro-pop record", but added that it is [...] "steeped in regret, pain, and even more self-examination than a typical Kanye West album". Music writer Robert Christgau called it a [...] "slow, sad-ass and self-involved ... breakup album" [...] and analyzed that West's choice to [...] "robotize as well as pitch-correct his voice both undercuts his self-importance and adds physical reality to tales of alienated fame that might otherwise be pure pity parties". Christgau asserted that its final track [...] "Pinocchio Story" [...] is [...] "the only track <b>here</b> <b>about</b> what's really bringing [...] down: not the loss of his girlfriend but the death of his mother, during cosmetic surgery that somewhere not too deep down he's sure traces all too directly to his alienated fame." [...] Andre Grant of HipHopDX wrote that [...] "to combat this trenchant melancholia, he poured himself into an all-autotunes R album" [...] which would prove divisive in hip hop. West's singing has been characterized as [...] "flat" [...] and [...] "nearly unmelodic" [...] which [...] "underscores his own cyborgish detachment." [...] Canadian writer Stephen Marche viewed that West used [...] "the shallow musical gimmickry of Auto-Tune, a program designed to eliminate individuality, and produced a hauntingly personal album." ...|$|E
