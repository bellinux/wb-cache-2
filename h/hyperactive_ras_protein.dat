40|$|Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells favour {{fermentation}} {{of sugar}} over r espiration {{in the presence}} of oxygen. In order to obtain a high glycolytic rate to metabolize fermentable sugars generating the required levels of ATP, yeast developed a complex signal transduction system controlling this process. One important protein in this signaling cascade is the small monomeric GTP-binding Ras protein. This essential protein is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and the establishment of fermentative metabolism. In the presence of glucose, the GTP-bound active Ras stimulates the activity of Cyr 1 /adenylate cyclase, which in turn, activates the protein kinase PKA. This kinase regulates many proteins by phosphorylation and is the main controller of the transcriptional response to glucose through direct phosphorylation of multiple transcription factors. In this study a direct link between high glycolytic rate and activation of Ras was discovered. This was first demonstrated by use of th e tps 1 mutant, which lacks feedback inhibition on hexokinase and as a r esult displays overactive in flux of sugar into glycolysis. We showed that glucose addition to this strain results in a hyperactivation of the Ras protein and in the appearance of typical apoptotical markers and cell death. Our results indicate that the induction of apoptosis in the tps 1 mutant is a direct consequence of the <b>hyperactive</b> <b>Ras</b> <b>protein.</b> Reducin g the activity of the Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway in the tps 1 background resul ts in the survival of this strain for growth on glucose based medium. By use of wild type permeabilized spheroplasts, where we removed the cell wall enzymatically before chemically creating holes in the plasma membrane through which metabolites but not proteins can difuse, we found the glycolytic intermediate fructose- 1, 6 -bisphosphate (Fru 1, 6 bisP) to be the crucial factor in the activation of Ras. In the tps 1 strain this compou nd can accumulate up to 20 mM. Inactivation of phosphofructokinase in the tps 1 strain abolishes Fru 1, 6 bisP hyperaccumulation as well as hyperact ivation of Ras in vivo. In our search for the mechanism of Fru 1, 6 bisP induced Ras activation, we found the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF), Cdc 25 and Sdc 25, to be required. Using deletion strains in the Ras GEF and GTPase activating proteins (GAP) and site-directed mutagenesis, we showed that the C-terminus of yeast Cdc 25 contains a region with the positively charged residues R 1122 and K 1491, which is required for Ras activation with Fru 1, 6 bisP, but not with GTP. This region is highly conserved among other Ras GEF proteins in different eukaryotic organisms including the human Ras GEF proteins,Sos 1 and Sos 2. The positively charged residues R 1122 and K 1491 in the yeast Cdc 25 protein have homologue residues in the human Sos 1 protein, namely K 602 and K 963. These residues are also required to activate the yeast Ras proteins with Fru 1, 6 bisP when CDC 25 is replaced by part of the human SOS 1 gene, but not with GTP. Mammalian cancer cells also show the unusual characteristic of favouring fermentation over respiration {{in the presence of}} oxygen. It remains controversial whether this strong fermentation is a cause or a symptom of cancer since no clear molecular link between glycolysis and proteins controlling cell proliferation has been identified. The here described Fru 1, 6 bisP-dependent activation of Ras may be one such molecular link. Our results therefore suggest {{that there may be a}} causal link between high glycolytic activity and rapid cell proliferation in glucose medium in yeast and cancer cells through Fru 1, 6 bisP activation of Ras and mediated by a conserved Fru 1, 6 bisP-binding domain in the C-terminus of Cdc 25 /Sos. status: publishe...|$|E

Here, we demonstrate that Eri 1 is {{a component of}} the GPI-GlcNAc transferase (GPI-GnT) complex in the ER, which catalyzes transfer of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to an acceptor phosphatidylinositol, {{the first step in the}} production of GPI-anchors for cell surface proteins. We also show that GTP bound Ras 2 associates with the GPI-GnT complex in vivo and inhibits its activity, indicating that yeast Ras uses the ER as a signaling platform from which to negatively regulate the GPI-GnT.

40|$|AbstractThe c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway is a dual-functional oncogenic {{signaling}} that exerts both anti- and pro-tumor activities. However, the {{mechanism by which}} JNK switches its oncogenic roles depending on different cellular contexts has been elusive. Here, using the Drosophila genetics, we show that <b>hyperactive</b> <b>Ras</b> acts as a signaling switch that converts JNK's role from anti- to pro-tumor signaling through the regulation of Hippo signaling activity. In the normal epithelium, JNK signaling antagonizes the Hippo pathway effector Yorkie (Yki) through elevation of Warts activity, thereby suppressing tissue growth. In contrast, {{in the presence of}} <b>hyperactive</b> <b>Ras,</b> JNK signaling enhances Yki activation by accumulating F-actin through the activity of the LIM domain protein Ajuba, thereby promoting tissue growth. We also find that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling uses this Ras-mediated conversion of JNK signaling to promote tissue growth. Our observations suggest that Ras-mediated switch of the JNK pathway from anti- to pro-tumor signaling could play crucial roles in tumorigenesis as well as in normal development...|$|R

They encode proteins with nearly 90 % homology to the first 80 positions of the mammalian <b>ras</b> <b>proteins,</b> and nearly 50 % homology to the next 80 amino acids. Yeast RAS 1 and RAS 2 proteins are more homologous to each other, with about 90 % homology for the first 180 positions.

40|$|The role of ras-encoded {{proteins}} and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in inositol phospholipid metabolism has been studied. PDGF stimulates inositol phospholipid turnover in confluent normal rat kidney (NRK) cells and enhances hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol monophosphate and phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate in NRK cell membranes {{in the presence}} of guanosine 5 '-[gamma-thio]triphosphate. The stimulatory effect of PDGF on phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate hydrolysis is not inhibited by pretreatment of NRK cells with pertussis toxin, implying that PDGF-stimulated phospholipase C activity of NRK cells is regulated by a pertussis toxin-insensitive guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) that is different from Gi (inhibitory G protein) or Go (G protein of unknown function). When bacterially made human normal or oncogenic T 24 <b>ras</b> <b>protein</b> is added to 32 P-labeled NRK cell membranes {{in the presence of}} guanosine 5 '-[gamma-thio]triphosphate, normal <b>ras</b> <b>protein</b> increases by 3 -fold the formation of inositol trisphosphate, whereas T 24 <b>ras</b> <b>protein</b> has no significant effect.

40|$|We {{identify}} {{a role for}} the GDI-like solubilizing factor (GSF) PDEδ in modulating signalling through <b>Ras</b> family G <b>proteins</b> by sustaining their dynamic distribution in cellular membranes.

This mechanism allows more effective trapping of depalmitoylated <b>Ras</b> <b>proteins</b> at the Golgi and polycationic <b>Ras</b> <b>proteins</b> at the plasma membrane to counter the entropic tendency to distribute these proteins over all intracellular membranes. Thus, PDEδ activity augments K/Hras signalling by enriching Ras at the plasma membrane; conversely, PDEδ down-modulation randomizes Ras distributions to all membranes in the cell and suppresses regulated signalling through wild-type Ras and also constitutive oncogenic Ras signalling in cancer cells.

40|$|Abstractp 21 <b>Ras</b> <b>proteins</b> play a {{critical}} role in the regulation of cellular growth and differentiation. In addition, <b>Ras</b> and <b>proteins</b> which regulate <b>Ras</b> activity have been implicated in long-term memory consolidation and long-term potentiation processes. Over the last few years, much evidence has emerged which indicates that changes in cytoplasmic Ca 2 + levels can regulate <b>Ras</b> <b>protein</b> activity and subsequent biological function. Also, <b>Ras</b> <b>proteins</b> themselves can modulate intracellular Ca 2 + levels by regulating both Ca 2 + release and Ca 2 + influx processes. Here we examine the signalling components which regulate Ras activity and, in particular, consider points of convergence between intracellular Ca 2 + and p 21 Ras signalling processes. In addition, we consider the possible biological consequences resulting from the integration of these signalling pathways and highlight the importance of our understanding protein–protein interactions. Finally, we discuss the possibility of protein–protein interactions mediated via Ca 2 +-responsive structural domains, such as the C 2 and IQ domains, playing important roles in Ca 2 +-dependent Ras functions yet to be established...|$|R

40|$|<b>Ras</b> <b>proteins</b> {{are highly}} conserved {{molecular}} switches that regulate cellular response to external stimuli. Dictyostelium discoideum contains an extensive family of <b>Ras</b> <b>proteins</b> that function in regulation of mitosis, cytoskeletal function and motility, and {{the onset of}} development. Little {{is known about the}} events that lead to the activation of <b>Ras</b> <b>proteins</b> in Dictyostelium, primarily owing to a lack of a biochemical assay to measure the levels of activated Ras. We have adapted an assay, used successfully to measure activated Ras in mammalian cells, to monitor activation of two Dictyostelium <b>Ras</b> <b>proteins,</b> RasC and RasG. We have found that the Ras-binding domain (RBD) of mammalian Raf 1 was capable of binding to the activated form of RasG, but not to the activated form of RasC; however, the RBD of Schizosaccharomyces pombe Byr 2 was capable of binding preferentially to the activated forms of both RasC and RasG. Using this assay, we discovered that RasC and RasG showed a rapid and transient activation when aggregation-competent cells were stimulated with the chemoattractant cAMP, and this activation did not occur in a number of cAMP signalling mutants. These data provide further evidence of a role for both RasC and RasG in the early development of Dictyostelium...|$|R
40|$|Background: Dictyostelium {{possesses}} a surprisingly {{large number of}} <b>Ras</b> <b>proteins</b> and {{little is known about}} their activators, the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). It is also unclear, in Dictyostelium or in higher eukaryotes, whether Ras pathways are linear, with each Ras controlled by its own GEF, or networked, with multiple GEFs acting on multiple <b>Ras</b> <b>proteins.</b> Results: We have identified the Dictyostelium gene that encodes RasGEFB, a protein with homology to known RasGEFs such as the Son-of-sevenless (Sos) protein. Dictyostelium cells in which the gene for RasGEFB was disrupted moved unusually rapidly, but lost the ability to perform macropinocytosis and therefore to grow in liquid medium. Crowns, the sites of macropinocytosis, were replaced by polarised lamellipodia. Mutant cells were also profoundly defective in early development, although they eventually formed tiny but normally proportioned fruiting bodies. This defect correlated with loss of discoidin Iγ mRNA, a starvation-induced gene, although other genes required for development were expressed normally or even precociously. RasGEFB was able to rescue a Saccharomyces CDC 25 mutant, indicating that it is a genuine GEF for <b>Ras</b> <b>proteins.</b> Conclusions: RasGEFB appears to be the principal activator of the RasS protein, which regulates macropinocytosis and cell speed, but it also appears to regulate one or more other <b>Ras</b> <b>proteins...</b>|$|R
40|$|Cancer {{biomarkers}} {{are currently}} {{the subject of}} intense research because of their potential utility for diagnosis, prognosis, and targeted therapy. In theory, the gene products resulting from somatic mutations are the ultimate protein biomarkers, being not simply associated with tumors but actually responsible for tumorigenesis. We show here that the altered protein products resulting from somatic mutations can be identified directly and quantified by mass spectrometry. The peptides expressed from normal and mutant alleles were detected by selected reaction monitoring (SRM) of their product ions using a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer. As a prototypical example of this approach, we demonstrated {{that it is possible}} to quantify the number and fraction of mutant <b>Ras</b> <b>protein</b> present in cancer cell lines. There were an average of 1. 3 million molecules of <b>Ras</b> <b>protein</b> per cell, and the ratio of mutant to normal <b>Ras</b> <b>proteins</b> ranged from 0. 49 to 5. 6. Similarly, we found that mutant <b>Ras</b> <b>proteins</b> could be detected and quantified in clinical specimens such as colorectal and pancreatic tumor tissues as well as in premalignant pancreatic cyst fluids. In addition to answering basic questions about the relative levels of genetically abnormal proteins in tumors, this approach could prove useful for diagnostic applications...|$|R
