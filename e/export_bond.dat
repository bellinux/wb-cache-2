40|$|This paper quantifies the {{economic}} impact of changes in U. S. monetary policy on emerging market countries. We explore empirically how country risk, as proxied by sovereign bond spreads, is influenced by U. S. monetary policy, country-specific fundamentals, and conditions in global capital markets. In addition, we simulate the direct effects of a tightening in U. S. monetary policy on economic conditions in developing countries. While country-specific fundamentals are important in explaining fluctuations in country risk, the stance and predictability of U. S. monetary policy are also important for stabilizing capital flows and capital market conditions and fostering economic growth in developing countries.

40|$|Using U. S. {{securities}} {{markets as}} a case history, the author explores the role securities markets play in economic development, how they emerge, and how regulation can make them more effective. Why the United States? Two centuries ago, {{it was a small}} undeveloped country with serious financial problems. It confronted those problems and, guided by Alexander Hamilton, creatively reformed its financial system, which then became a foundation of the U. S. economic infrastructure and a bulwark for long-term growth. When Hamilton's program established public credit and securitiesmarkets in the 1790 s, U. S. citizens were immediately able to borrow from older, richer countries. U. S. wealth then increased until, {{by the end of the}} nineteenth century, U. S. residents began to lend and invest more abroad than they borrowed. During the 1820 s and 1830 s, the United States (usually state governments) borrowed large sums from foreign investors to build roads, canals, and early railroads, to make other transportation improvements, and to capitalize state banks. From the 1830 s to the end of the century, still larger sums from overseas went into private U. S. railway companies that provided cheap transcontinental transportation. Most of this borrowing took the form of state and corporate bond sales to overseas investors. The pristine U. S. government credit established by Hamilton thus rubbed off on U. S. state and corporate debt. The British stock market did better than the U. S. market until the United States adopted security-market regulation (including disclosuire rules) under the SEC. Then the U. S. market became a world leader. The U. S. stock market developed more slowly than the bond market, but it both aided and benefited from foreign investment in U. S. bonds. Foreign investors preferred debt securities to equities, yet equities create a safety margin for bondholders who, because of this margin, are more willing to purchase and hold bonds. Foreign investors preferred bonds; U. S. investors, after <b>exporting</b> <b>bonds,</b> held more stocks than bonds at home. Why? Because good stock markets permit the conversion of equity securities into cash.

40|$|Foreign aid {{flows to}} poor, aid-dependent economies are highly {{volatile}} and pro-cyclical. Shortfalls in aid coincide with shortfalls in GDP and government revenues. This increases the consumption volatility in aid dependent countries, thereby causing substantial welfare losses. This paper finds that indexing aid flows to exogenous shocks like {{a change in}} the terms of trade can significantly improve the welfare of aid-dependent country by lowering its output and consumption volatility. Compared to the benchmark specification with stochastic aid flows, indexation of aid flows to terms of trade shocks can reduce the cost of business cycle fluctuations in the recipient country by four percent of permanent consumption. Moreover, use of indexed aid can allow donors to reduce the aid flows by three percent without lowering the level of welfare in the recipient country.
