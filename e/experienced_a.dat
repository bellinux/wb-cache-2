The city also <b>experienced</b> <b>a</b> depression in 1893 after the crash of silver prices. In 1887, the precursor to the international charity United Way was formed in Denver by local religious leaders who raised funds and coordinated various charities to help Denver's poor. By 1890, Denver had grown to be the second-largest city west of Omaha, Nebraska. In 1900, whites represented 96.8% of Denver's population.|$|E

50|$|In human sexuality, the {{refractory}} period {{is usually the}} recovery phase after orgasm during which it is physiologically impossible {{for a man to}} have additional orgasms due to increase in the penile sensory threshold (PST).

50|$|Women {{are able}} to achieve {{multiple}} orgasms {{due to the fact}} that they generally do not require a refractory period like men do after the first orgasm; though generally reported that women do not <b>experience</b> <b>a</b> refractory period and thus can <b>experience</b> <b>an</b> additional orgasm, or multiple orgasms, soon after the first orgasm, some sources state that both men and women <b>experience</b> <b>a</b> refractory period because, due to clitoral hypersensitivity or sexual satisfaction, women may also <b>experience</b> <b>a</b> period after orgasm in which further sexual stimulation does not produce excitement.|$|R

5|$|England manager Graham Taylor's {{tenure at}} the club saw Watford scale new heights. Between Taylor's {{appointment}} in 1977 and departure in 1987, Watford rose from the Fourth Division to the First Division.

Watford <b>experienced</b> <b>a</b> decade of decline between 1987 and 1997, before Taylor returned as full-time manager, leading the team to successive promotions from the renamed Second Division to the Premier League for one season in 1999–2000. The club <b>experienced</b> <b>a</b> further one season stint in the top division of English football during the 2006–07 season, under Aidy Boothroyd's management; eight years in the Championship followed. Watford secured promotion in 2014–15, and have remained in the Premier League since the 2015–16 season.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines how}} media-induced consumer activation level affects consumer response to highly energetic commercials. Over six studies, including a Hulu field experiment, the authors report that consumers who are <b>experiencing</b> <b>a</b> deactivating emotion (e. g., sadness induced by a movie) {{find it more}} difficult to watch highly energetic commercials compared with consumers who are not <b>experiencing</b> <b>a</b> deactivating emotion. As <b>a</b> result, consumers <b>experiencing</b> <b>a</b> deactivating emotion are less likely to watch highly energetic commercials and recall the advertiser compared with consumers who are not <b>experiencing</b> <b>a</b> deactivating emotion. The authors do not observe these effects when consumers <b>experiencing</b> <b>a</b> deactivating emotion watch commercials that are moderately energetic or when consumers do not <b>experience</b> <b>a</b> deactivating emotion. These findings suggest that when advertisers run commercials in a media context that induces a deactivating emotion (e. g., sadness, relaxation, contentment), they should avoid running highly energetic commercials (e. g., with upbeat, enthusiastic spokespeople). In addition, this research recommends that when advertisers are unable to determine the emotions induced by the media context, they should run commercials that are moderate in energy. The results of a metaanalysis across the present studies show that consumers <b>experiencing</b> <b>a</b> deactivating emotion will respond as much as 50 % more favorably to moderately energetic commercials compared with highly energetic commercials...|$|R

25|$|Optimism bias is {{typically}} measured through two determinants of risk: absolute risk, where individuals {{are asked to}} estimate their likelihood of <b>experiencing</b> <b>a</b> negative event compared to their actual chance of <b>experiencing</b> <b>a</b> negative event (comparison against self), and comparative risk, where individuals are asked to estimate the likelihood of <b>experiencing</b> <b>a</b> negative event (their personal risk estimate) compared to others {{of the same age}} and sex (a target risk estimate). Problems can occur when trying to measure absolute risk because it is extremely difficult to determine the actual risk statistic for a person. Therefore, the optimistic bias is primarily measured in comparative risk forms, where people compare themselves against others, through direct and indirect comparisons. Direct comparisons ask whether an individual's own risk of <b>experiencing</b> <b>an</b> event is less than, greater than, or equal to someone else's risk, while indirect comparisons ask individuals to provide separate estimates of their own risk of <b>experiencing</b> <b>an</b> event and other's risk of experiencing the same event.|$|R
40|$|To date a {{significant}} {{share of the}} European population can be considered at risk of social exclusion. It {{has been argued that}} adult education programmes are a powerful tool to support vulnerable adults increasing their social inclusion. This study aims to answer the question if and which subgroups of vulnerable adults <b>experience</b> <b>an</b> increase in social inclusion after joining adult education programmes. The results of our study show that 46. 3 % of the participants <b>experience</b> <b>an</b> increase of social inclusion in terms of 'activation and internalization' and 41. 0 % <b>experience</b> <b>an</b> increase in 'participation and connection'. Results show that foreigners and people who live together <b>experience</b> <b>a</b> higher increase on variables of 'activation and internalization' and 'participation and connection'. Furthermore, results show that learners who received school education at a primary level and have no professional qualification <b>experience</b> <b>a</b> higher increase of social inclusion on a few variables of social inclusion...|$|R
