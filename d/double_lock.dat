5|$|The canal {{company went}} {{bankrupt}} and {{was bought by}} the state in 1886. This briefly gave it a new lease of life, but the canal had an obsolete gauge. By {{the start of the}} 20th century it was almost abandoned. The canal was neglected and parts were filled in. In the 1970s the A47 autoroute between Givors and Saint-Étienne covered almost all the sections that remained, apart from the site at Tartaras where the <b>double</b> <b>lock</b> and tunnel have been preserved as a heritage site.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the first}} {{projects}} of the Irish Free State in the 1920s was the Shannon hydroelectric scheme which established the Ardnacrusha power station on the lower Shannon above Limerick. The old Killaloe to Limerick canal with its five locks was abandoned and the head race constructed from Lough Derg also served for navigation. A <b>double</b> <b>lock</b> was provided at the dam.|$|E
25|$|The {{bones were}} unconditionally repatriated in 1992 to the {{traditional}} owners, an alliance called the Three Traditional Tribal Groups (3TTG), consisting of the Paakantji, the Muthi Muthi, and the Ngiyampaa. LM1 had {{become a symbol of}} the long Aboriginal occupation in Australia, and an important icon for both archaeologists and indigenous Australians. LM1 is now in a locked vault at the Mungo National Park exhibition centre. The vault has a <b>double</b> <b>lock</b> and can be opened only if two keys are used. One key is controlled by archaeologists, the other by the local indigenous peoples.|$|E
50|$|Thumbcuffs with <b>double</b> <b>locks</b> have a lockspring which when engaged, usually {{using the}} top of the key, stops the thumbcuff from {{ratcheting}} tighter and prevents the subject from tightening them, possibly causing injury. <b>Double</b> <b>locks</b> also make picking the locks more difficult.|$|R
50|$|The <b>double</b> <b>locking</b> {{bridge is}} a Floyd Rose {{licensed}} Jackson Low Profile JT-580 LP <b>Double</b> <b>Locking</b> 2-Point Tremolo, mounted in a routed recess. The headstock utilizes Jackson branded die-cast tuners supplied by Jin-Ho of Korea (model #J-07). These parts {{and the other}} minor bits (strap buttons, knobs) are coated in black chrome.|$|R
50|$|Smith & Wesson {{restraints}} are, {{depending on}} the model, made of carbon or stainless steel. They are equipped with heat treated internal lockworks, featuring smooth ratchets for swift cuffing and <b>double</b> <b>locks</b> to prevent tampering. The company currently uses three different <b>double</b> <b>locking</b> systems: the characteristic slot lock {{as well as a}} push pin lock or their newly patented M&P lever lock system.|$|R
25|$|Seaming technique. This is a {{vertical}} or horizontal classical cladding construction used in copper roof and façade designs. Available in sheets and strips, the cladding is fixed with clips. Since water tightness {{may not be}} a concern on vertical surfaces, angle standing seams are often sufficient. <b>Double</b> <b>lock</b> standing seams are often not necessary. Links to photographs of horozontal and vertical standing and flat lock seams at the University of Debrecen's Copper Gateway in Hungary and of pre-oxidized copper clad seamed facades at the Hotel Crowne Plaza Milano, in Milan, Italy, are available.|$|E
500|$|In November 2007 work {{started to}} clear the canal between Ryeford <b>Double</b> <b>Lock</b> and Oil Mills Bridge. Oil Mills Bridge itself has been rebuilt, with the {{brickwork}} left after its demolition being incorporated into the new bridge. By mid-2012, when the Inland Waterways Association held a trailboat festival on the refurbished canal, {{as part of an}} event called [...] "Stroud on Water", over [...] of canal from Ocean swingbridge to the bottom of Dudbridge Locks were open for navigation, as was a second section {{from the top of the}} locks to the bottom of Wallbridge Locks on the Thames and Severn Canal. As part of the restoration of the Dudbridge Locks, a hydro-electric installation has been built. The scheme is expected to generate over 100 MWh per year, and income from the sale of the electricity to the national grid will help to fund ongoing maintenance of the canal.|$|E

60|$|But Peter and Sogrange {{were both}} of them too wise to expend any more of their {{strength}} in a useless struggle. They suffered themselves to be conducted without resistance across the white stone hall, down a long passage, and into {{a room at the}} end, the window and fireplace of which were both blocked up. The floor was of red flags and the walls whitewashed. The only furniture was a couple of kitchen chairs and a long table. The door was of stout oak and fitted with a <b>double</b> <b>lock.</b> The sole outlet, so far as they could see, was a small round hole {{at the top of the}} roof. The door was locked behind them. They were alone.|$|E

50|$|Handcuffs with <b>double</b> <b>locks</b> have a detent which when engaged {{stops the}} cuff from {{ratcheting}} tighter {{to prevent the}} wearer from tightening them. Tightening could be intentional or by struggling; if tightened, the handcuffs may cause nerve damage or loss of circulation. Also some wearers could tighten the cuffs to attempt an escape by having the officer loosen the cuffs and attempting to escape while the cuffs are loose. <b>Double</b> <b>locks</b> also make picking the locks more difficult.|$|R
60|$|I {{may as well}} {{announce}} at {{once that}} John Eames, when {{he went up to}} London, was absolutely and irretrievably in love with Lily Dale. He had declared his passion in the most moving language a hundred times; but he had declared it only to himself. He had written much poetry about Lily, but he kept his lines safe under <b>double</b> <b>lock</b> and key. When he gave the reins to his imagination, he flattered himself that he might win not only her but the world at large also by his verses; but he would have perished rather than exhibit them to human eye. During the last ten weeks of his life at Guestwick, while he was preparing for his career in London, he hung about Allington, walking over frequently and then walking back again; but all in vain. During these visits he would sit in Mrs Dale's drawing-room, speaking but little, and addressing himself usually to the mother; but on each occasion, as he started on his long, hot walk, he resolved that he would say something by which Lily might know of his love. When he left for London that something had not been said.|$|E
60|$|As it happened, we {{had more}} ample time and freedom to inspect this cathedral than any other that we have visited, for the old woman consented to go away and leave us there, locking the door behind her. The others, except Rosebud, sat down to sketch such {{portions}} as struck their fancy; and for myself, I looked at the monuments, of which some, being those of old knights, ladies, bishops, and a king, were curious from their antiquity; and others are interesting as bearing memorials of English people, who have died at Lausanne in comparatively recent years. Then I went up into the pulpit, and tried, without success, {{to get into the}} stone gallery that runs all round the nave; and I explored my way into various side apartments of the cathedral, which I found fitted up with seats for Sabbath schools, perhaps, or possibly for meetings of elders of the Church. I opened the great Bible of the church, and found it to be a French version, printed at Lille some fifty years ago. There was also a liturgy, adapted, probably, to the Lutheran form of worship. In one of the side apartments I found a strong box, heavily clamped with iron, and having a contrivance, like the hopper of a mill, by which money could be turned into the top, while a <b>double</b> <b>lock</b> prevented its being abstracted again. This was to receive the avails of contributions made in the church; and there were likewise boxes, stuck on the ends of long poles, wherewith the deacons could go round among the worshippers, conveniently extending the begging-box to the remotest curmudgeon among them all. From the arrangement of the seats in the nave, and the labels pasted or painted on them, I judged that the women sat {{on one side and the}} men on the other, and the seats for various orders of magistrates, and for ecclesiastical and collegiate people, were likewise marked out.|$|E

50|$|Nonetheless, {{a gift of}} a unit to Van Halen by Floyd Rose himself {{gave the}} unit instant {{overnight}} success and credibility. Still more stability {{was provided by the}} addition of a second lock on the bridge nut, making a <b>double</b> <b>locking</b> tremolo system that was more complex to set up. The <b>double</b> <b>locking</b> design is sometimes called a two-point locking tremolo, inviting confusion with the Fender two-point synchronized tremolo, which is a different concept and not a locking tremolo at all.|$|R

The S series uses a Zero-Resistance (ZR) <b>double</b> <b>locking</b> tremolo system from 2003 till 2014. The ZR tremolo system uses ball-bearings as opposed to knife edges for pivot points and a built-in counter-tension system called the Zero Point System. The Zero Point System can be removed to change the tremolo to full-floating operation.The current line (2014) uses mainly Edge Zero ii systems, which are knife edge based.|$|R
