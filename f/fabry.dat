The diagnosis of <b>Fabry’s</b> disease was based on serum a-galactosidase A activity and typical histo-logical features from renal biopsy in the index patient. Genetic analysis of two hemizygous male patients revealed a missense mutation predicting a leucine to proline substitution (L 14 P) in the a-galactosidase gene causing classical <b>Fabry’s</b> disease in this family.

Over the full distance of the lap Brasier's Baras was the quickest; his lap time of 52minutes and 25.4seconds (52:25.4) moved him up to third position {{on the road and}} into the lead overall. A mechanical problem caused Gabriel to lose control of his car at Saint-Calais; he regained control in time to avoid a serious accident but was forced to retire. Baras maintained his lead after the second lap, but fell back to second the next lap as Szisz took over the lead. As the day grew hotter—it reached a high of —the tar began to melt, which proved to be a greater problem than the dust; it was kicked up by the cars into the faces of the drivers and their mechanics, seeping past their goggles and inflaming their eyes. The Renault driver, J. Edmond, was particularly affected: his broken goggles allowed more tar to seep past and rendered him nearly blind. His attempts to change the goggles at a pit stop were rejected by officials on the grounds that equipment could not be replaced mid-race. Nor could another driver be substituted; he continued for two more laps before retiring.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE. <b>Fabry's</b> {{disease may}} be {{difficult}} to differentiate from symmetric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Our aim was to compare the myocardial location and distribution patterns of delayed enhancement between patients with <b>Fabry's</b> disease who are affected by symmetric myocardial hypertrophy and patients with symmetric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in order to identify a specific sign to best differentiate the two diseases. CONCLUSION. Patients with <b>Fabry's</b> disease-related hypertrophy showed left ventricular (LV) delayed enhancement with a typical and consistently found pattern characterized by the involvement of the inferolateral basal or mid basal segments and a mesocardial distribution that spared the subendocardium. This pattern seems to be specific to <b>Fabry's</b> disease; in fact, patients with symmetric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy had variable locations and distributions of delayed enhancement.

40|$|Lysosomal storage {{disorders}} are {{a group of}} disorders characterised by the deficiency of a specific lysosomal hydrolase. These diseases are rare, {{with only a few}} hundred patients in the Netherlands. <b>Fabry's</b> disease, an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder, is caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme α-galactosidase A which results in, among other things, left ventricular hypertrophy, renal failure and cerebrovascular events. Patients with <b>Fabry's</b> disease, especially males, have a decreased life expectancy. Recent studies have shown that <b>Fabry's</b> disease may be much more common among patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) than previously thought. Up to 7 % of male patients with left ventricular hypertrophy and up to 12 % of female patients with unexplained LVH were found to suffer from <b>Fabry's</b> disease.

40|$|<b>Fabry’s</b> {{disease is}} an {{uncommon}} X-linked disease {{in which the}} activity of α-galactosidase A (AGalA), a lysosomal enzyme, is deficient. Clinical manifestation results from occlusive microvascular lesions affecting the heart, kidneys, peripheral nerves and brain. A Chinese kindred with 5 members in two generations {{were found to be}} affected by <b>Fabry’s</b> disease. Diagnosis was established by genetic analysis and/or measurement of serum AGalA activity. The index patient was a 24 -year-old pregnant woman who was heterozygous for <b>Fabry’s</b> disease seeking genetic counseling. The patient was reassured after a chorionic villus sample showed only wild type AGalA gene in a male fetus. The baby was delivered full term and postnatal serum AGalA was assessed to be normal. Her mother was investigated for asymptomatic proteinuria and a renal biopsy revealed podocytes packed with myelin bodies. Their serum AGalA activities were subnormal. The two maternal uncles of the patient had clinically manifest <b>Fabry’s</b> disease. One of them suffered end stage renal disease when 35 years old and the other had cardiomyopathy since he was 33 years of age. They had low serum AGalA activity. Direct sequencing of the AGalA gene of the uncles identified a missense mutation in exon 1 predicting a leucine to praline substitution (L 14 P). The patient’s 22 -year-old younger sister had a normal serum AGalA activity. Analysis, however, showed that both the patient and her sister harbored the defective gene and were heterozygous for <b>Fabry’s</b> disease. <b>Fabry’s</b> disease is rare and the diagnosis may be easily missed or delayed.

25|$|The typical {{pathophysiology}} of HUS {{involves the}} binding of Shiga-toxin to the globotriaosylceramide (Gb3; also called ceramide trihexoside which accumulates in <b>Fabry</b> disease) receptor {{on the surface}} of the glomerular endothelium. This action includes a cascade of signaling events leading to apoptosis and binding of leukocytes to endothelial cells. The Shiga-toxin-activated endothelial cells then become thrombogenic (clot-producing) by mechanism that is not fully understood, though they have been shown to induce the release of cytokines and chemokines that are implicated in platelet activation. Additionally, the binding action of Shiga-toxin inactivates a metalloproteinase called ADAMTS13, the deficiency of which causes the closely related TTP. Once ADAMTS13 is disabled, multimers of von Willebrand Factor (vWF) form and initiate platelet activation, causing microthrombus formation. The activation of platelets resulting from inhibition of ADAMTS13 is due to the hyperactivity of large multimers of uncleaved vWF. The arterioles and capillaries of the body become obstructed by the resulting complexes of activated platelets, which have adhered to the endothelium via large multimeric vWF. Through a mechanism known as microangiopathic hemolysis, the growing thrombi lodged in smaller vessels destroy red blood cells (RBCs) as they squeeze through the narrowed blood vessels, forming schistocytes, or fragments of sheared RBCs. The presence of schistocytes is a key finding that helps to diagnose HUS. Typically, this hemolysis results in a hemoglobin level of less than 80g/L.|$|E
