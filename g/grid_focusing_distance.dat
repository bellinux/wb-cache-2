5000|$|<b>Focusing</b> <b>distance</b> range limiter switch: This switch {{is found}} on most longer focal length lenses, and macro lenses. It {{is used for}} {{limiting}} the <b>focusing</b> <b>distance</b> range of the lens when using it in autofocus mode. Most lenses have two settings; these are usually full focus range (from minimum <b>focus</b> <b>distance</b> to infinity), and distant focus range (from halfway point of focus range to infinity). Other lenses have three settings, with the additional setting usually being near focus range (from minimum <b>focus</b> <b>distance</b> to halfway point of focus range). Longer focal length lenses and macro lenses have a relatively long travel <b>distance</b> for the <b>focusing</b> mechanism inside the lens; this feature shortens the autofocus time. When the photographer knows they will not need a certain part of the <b>focus</b> <b>distance</b> range, limiting it will help shorten the autofocus time, and possibly prevent [...] "focus hunting".|$|R

50|$|Like all {{focusing}} anamorphics, Iscoramas cannot {{focus on}} close subjects without {{the assistance of}} a diopter. This problem is easy to underestimate due to the imprecise focus scales on the Iscorama 36, 42, and 54 models. The focus scales on all these lenses indicate a minimum <b>focus</b> <b>distance</b> of 6 ft (just over 1.8m). However, when these adapters are attached to most standard 50mm focal length taking lenses, the measured minimum <b>focus</b> <b>distance</b> is 2.8m. Some of the 2000 series monobloc lenses, which are the combination of a third-party manufacturer's taking lens plus the optics from an Iscorama 36 (Iscorama 42 {{in the case of the}} Iscorama 2004), also have a minimum <b>focus</b> <b>distance</b> of approximately 3m.|$|R

5000|$|Therefore, some prime {{lenses of}} this era began using [...] "floating elements" [...] - zoom-like {{differential}} cell movement in nested helicals for better close-up performance. For example, retrofocus wide angle lenses {{tend to have}} excessive spherical aberration and astigmatism at close <b>focusing</b> <b>distances</b> and so the Nippon Kogaku Nikkor-N Auto 24mm f/2.8 (Japan) of 1967 for Nikon 35mm SLRs had a Close Range Correction system with a rear three element cell that moved separately from the main lens to maintain good wide aperture image quality to a close <b>focus</b> <b>distance</b> of 30 cm/1 ft.|$|R
50|$|<b>Focus</b> film <b>{{distance}}</b> (FFD) is {{the distance}} between the X-ray source and the film in diagnostic radiography.

40|$|International audienceProjectors are {{important}} display devices for large scale augmented reality applications. However, precisely calibrating projectors with large <b>focus</b> <b>distances</b> implies a trade-off between practicality and accuracy. People either need a huge calibration board or a precise 3 D model [12]. In this paper, {{we present a}} practical projector-camera calibration method to solve this problem. The user only needs a small calibration board to calibrate the system regardless of the <b>focus</b> <b>distance</b> of the projector. Results show that the root-mean-squared re-projection error (RMSE) for a 450 cm projection distance is only about 4 mm, {{even though it is}} calibrated using a small B 4 (250 × 353 mm) calibration board...|$|R
