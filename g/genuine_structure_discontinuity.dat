This helped to revise the ranks and weights assigned to different thematic maps and its classes.

40|$|Abstract. Since its {{launch in}} 2009, the space mission Kepler has {{provided}} {{an amount of}} data of unprecedented quality. In particular, red giants exhibit an oscillation spectrum arranged in a regular pattern called the universal oscillation pattern. Here we analyse and characterize the departures observed from this universal pattern. We measured the deviation {{for more than one}} hundred red giants and attribute it to glitches related to the region of second ionisation of helium. The Kepler space mission has observed many red giants and helped deciphering their main charac-teristics (mass, radius, core rotation) from their oscillation spectra. The red giant oscillation pattern has been depicted, for pressure modes, with a canonical form, called universal red giant oscillation pattern ([1]). In this study, we aim to investigate the deviations from this universal pattern and characterize them as a signature of the second helium ionisation zone. Long-cadence data from Kepler up to the quarter 13 (1120 days) was used for a set of 216 stars for which the evolutionary status was already deduced ([2]). We focused our study on radial modes since non-radial modes have a mixed character and are, therefore, not pure pressure modes. Modes were fitted with Lorentzian models to adjust their fre-quency position ([3]). We then calculated the frequency difference between consecutive radial modes, called the local large separation (Δνobs) and compared these observed values of Δν with the theoreti-cal ones (ΔνUP (n)) provided by the universal pattern ([1]). Deviations from this universal pattern were characterized as glitches. Glitches correspond to local sound-speed variations induced by inner <b>structure</b> <b>discontinuities</b> of the star. These sound-speed variations produced a shift in the observed frequencies. Glitches in red giants are mainly produced by the <b>structure</b> <b>discontinuity</b> related to the second helium ionisation zone, as shown by [4]. We then adjusted one oscillation component to the modulation observed in the stars frequencies: δg = A〈Δν 〉 cos 2 π(ν − νmax...|$|R

The assay for anti-AChE activity {{is often used}} to lead anti-Alzheimer's drugs. Methods: The five phenolic glycosides, tiliroside, leonurusoside C, 2 ‴-syringoylrutin, rutin, and lavanduliofolioside were isolated from L.  japonicus. The activities of the glycosides were relatively low. Seven compounds including p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, hydroxytyrosol, salidroside, syringic acid, kaempferol, and quercetin, which are produced by the hydrolysis of the five glycosides, were also assayed for anti-AChE activity. Results: Of those seven compounds, the five compounds other than salidroside and syringic acid exhibited potent anti-AChE activities. In particular, the IC 50 s of caffeic acid and quercetin were (1. 05  ±  0. 19) and (3. 58  ±  0. 02)  μg/mL, respectively. Rutin was the most abundant flavonoid in the extract (9. 18  mg/g as measured by HPLC).

40|$|Our {{goal is to}} fit the {{multiple}} instances (or structures) of a generic model existing in data. Here we propose a novel model selection scheme to estimate the number of <b>genuine</b> <b>structures</b> present. In contrast to conventional model selection approaches, our method is driven by kernel-based learning. The input data is first clustered based on their potential to have emerged from the same structure. However the number of clusters is deliberately overestimated to obtain a set of initial model fits onto the data. We then resolve the oversegmentation via a series of kernel optimisation conducted through multiple kernel learning, {{and the concept of}} kernel-target alignment is used as a model selection criterion. Experiments on synthetic and real data show that our method outperforms previous model selection schemes. We also focus on the application of multibody motion segmentation.

Our method progressively accumu-lates evidence in the search space, and uses the information to dynamically (1) identify outliers, (2) filter unpromising hypotheses, and (3) bias the sampling for active discovery of multiple structures in the data—All achieved without sac-rificing the speed associated with sampling-based methods.
