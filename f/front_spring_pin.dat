5000|$|Slotted <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> are {{cylindrical}} pins rolled from a {{strip of}} material with a slot to allow the pin to have some flexibility during insertion. Slotted <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> are also known as roll pins or [...] "C" [...] pins.|$|R
50|$|A <b>spring</b> <b>pin</b> (also called {{tension pin}} or roll pin) is a {{mechanical}} fastener that secures {{the position of}} two or more parts of a machine relative to each other. <b>Spring</b> <b>pins</b> have a body diameter which is larger than the hole diameter, and a chamfer on either one or both ends to facilitate starting the pin into the hole. The spring action of the pin allows it to compress as it assumes the diameter of the hole. The force exerted by the pin against the hole wall retains it in the hole, therefore a <b>spring</b> <b>pin</b> is considered a self retaining fastener. <b>Spring</b> <b>pins</b> are designed for use in double shear applications.|$|R

50|$|When coiled <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> are installed, the {{compression}} {{starts at the}} outer edge and moves through the coils toward the center. Coiled pins continue to flex after insertion when a load {{is applied to the}} pin thus providing excellent performance to counter fatigue in dynamic applications. Coiled <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> were invented by Herman Koehl circa 1948.|$|R

50|$|During {{development}} it is {{not practical}} to solder BGAs into place, and sockets are used instead, but tend to be unreliable. There are two common types of socket: the more reliable type has <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> that push up under the balls, although it does not allow using BGAs with the balls removed as the <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> may be too short.|$|R
50|$|In {{engineering}} and machine design, a pin is a machine element that secures {{the position of}} two or more parts of a machine relative to each other. A large variety of types has been known for a long time; the most commonly used are solid cylindrical pins, solid tapered pins, groove <b>pins,</b> slotted <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> and spirally coiled <b>spring</b> <b>pins.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Heavy duty coiled <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> are {{typically}} used in high shear strength applications and hardened host materials.|$|R
5000|$|Standard duty coiled <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> {{offer the}} best balance between {{flexibility}} and strength and are recommended for most applications.|$|R
50|$|A coiled <b>spring</b> <b>pin,</b> {{also known}} as a spiral pin, is a self {{retaining}} engineered fastener manufactured by roll forming metal strip into a spiral cross section of 2 1/4 coils. Coiled <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> have a body diameter larger than the recommended hole diameter and chamfers on both ends to facilitate starting the pin into the hole, the spring action of the pin allows it to compress as it assumes the diameter of the hole.|$|R

50|$|Coiled pins are commercially {{available}} {{in three different}} duties, standard (ISO 8750), heavy (ISO 8748) and light duty (ISO 8751), which provide {{for a variety of}} combinations of strength, flexibility and diameter to suit different mating host materials and performance requirements. Typical materials for coiled <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> include high carbon steel, stainless steel and alloy 6150.|$|R
50|$|The car {{features}} inboard <b>front</b> <b>springs</b> and dampers and replaceable GRP body panels, {{which are}} intended to reduce repair costs {{in the event of}} an accident.|$|R
5000|$|ZIF sockets can be {{used for}} ball grid array chips, {{particularly}} during development. These sockets tend to be unreliable, failing to grab all the solder balls. Another type of BGA socket, also free of insertion force but not a [...] "ZIF socket" [...] in the traditional sense, does a better job by using <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> to push up underneath the balls.|$|R

50|$|<b>Front</b> <b>Spring</b> Perches - Some {{owners have}} {{reported}} rust {{problems on the}} <b>front</b> <b>spring</b> perches - the top perches, which hold {{the tops of the}} <b>springs</b> for the <b>front</b> suspension. The perches are spot welded to the chassis, and factory coated in a weatherproof mastic to stop their rusting, however in some rare occurrences, water gets behind the mastic causing the perches to rust and eventually to fail - leading to collapse of the suspension. The car remains controllable. This is a problem that Mercedes USA have acknowledged. The problem is not identifiable without first removing the mastic to check.|$|R
50|$|The Speed Four is {{mechanically}} {{similar to}} its predecessor, the TT600, with the exceptions of the cam profiles, ignition and fuel injection mapping, <b>front</b> <b>spring</b> rate, and other minor concessions to its streetfighter style; {{the frame and}} fully adjustable suspension are race-ready.|$|R
5000|$|A {{development}} of the Geordie lamp was the Purdy. A galley with gauze provided the inlet, above the glass was a chimney with perforated copper cap and gauze outer. A brass tube protected the upper works, shielded them and kept them locked in position. A <b>sprung</b> <b>pin</b> locked the whole together. [...] The pin could only be released by applying a vacuum to a captive hollow screw; not something that a nicotine starved miner could do at the coal face.|$|R
50|$|The {{frame is}} U-profile pressed from 8 mm thick steel, with profile height of 250 mm and 90 mm width. Both {{front and rear}} leaf springs are 1 500 mm long; the <b>front</b> <b>springs</b> consist of 11 leaves, rear springs have got 16 each.|$|R
50|$|The {{suspension}} is by half-elliptical <b>springs</b> in <b>front</b> and behind, {{those at}} the back being underhung. The <b>front</b> <b>springs</b> are flat-set, held out-of-centre and shackled forward. Dampers are fitted front and back. The four-wheel brakes are cable operated. Steering is by Marles cam and roller.|$|R
50|$|All late model M3s {{received}} subframe re-inforcements {{and more}} aggressive front end suspension geometry {{due to the}} differences in caster and camber yielded by top hat design and lower control arm bushings. Additionally, <b>front</b> <b>spring</b> rate was increased in addition to spindle and control arm geometry changes.|$|R
40|$|Novel spring {{contactors}} {{were designed}} and characterized for wafer-level interposer and high-speed package test system applications, especially for wafer-level packages. These contactors {{can be used}} as replacement for vertical wafer probes as well as test sockets used in the final test. The contactor pin consists of a plunger section made of beryllium copper and a plated helical stainless steel spring wire. It is 5 mm in uncompressed total length, including the plunger and the spring. The overall diameter of the spring wire section was 0. 51 mm. The design of the contactor is much simpler and more scalable than that of traditional <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> called Pogo pins used in package tests. A test socket containing 36 contactor pins was constructed for tests and measurements. The experimental characterization shows $-$ 1 -dB bandwidth of 3. 73 GHz for 0. 8 -mm pitch, measured by the direct contact method. This experimental result correlates well with the simulated results. The rise time was 82 ps as measured by TDR, and the propagation delay was 23 ps. The electrical conduction path is through the <b>pin</b> and the <b>spring,</b> making it a reliable contact. However, the electrical path is known to be through the barrel, not the spring for the regular <b>spring</b> <b>pins...</b>|$|R
50|$|Steering is by cam and lever. Rear {{suspension}} is by half-elliptical, {{and practically}} flat, springs mounted beneath the axle and on rubber pads. <b>Front</b> <b>springs</b> are splayed. Single-acting hydraulic shock absorbers {{are employed in}} front and back. Bumpers are supplied fore and aft {{and there is a}} folding luggage grid.|$|R
50|$|New parts include new <b>front</b> <b>springs</b> (14 mm/100 kg), new rear springs (16.2 mm/100 kg),recalibrated shock {{absorber}} settings, grooved brake discs, new alloy wheels are {{fitted with a}} different offset increasing the track by 4 mm, optional Toyo Proxes R888 225/40R18 tyres (Michelin Pilot Sport 2 235/40R18 standard) and stiffer lower arm bushes.|$|R
