Hermione {{would have}} been his slave--there was in her a horrible desire to prostrate herself before a man--a man who worshipped her, however, and admitted her as the supreme thing. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> an odalisk. <b>He</b> wanted a woman to TAKE something from him, to give herself up {{so much that she}} could take the last realities of him, the last facts, the last physical facts, physical and unbearable.|$|R

There he found Gerald standing {{with his back to}} the fire, in the library, as motionless as a man is, who is completely and emptily restless, utterly hollow. <b>He</b> had <b>done</b> all the work he wanted to do--and now there was nothing. He could go out in the car, he could run to town. But <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to go out in the car, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to run to town, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to call on the Thirlbys. He was suspended motionless, in an agony of inertia, like a machine that is without power.|$|R

5|$|Harley's co-creator, Paul Dini, {{describes}} {{their relationship}} as Harley being someone {{who makes the}} Joker feel better about himself, and who can do the work that <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do himself. In the 1999 one-shot comic Batman: Harley Quinn, the Joker decides to kill Harley, after admitting that he does care for her, that their relationship is romantic, and that these feelings prevent him from fulfilling his purpose.

5|$|Patrice {{decides to}} perform the final scene of a {{vaudeville}} play he has written called La Pendule (The Clock). He explains the complex plot and characters: set in 1929 in a townhouse in Provence, the play involves the Duke of Ponfouy and his family, associates and household servants. He performs the scene, playing all the characters himself and exaggerating their voices and mannerisms. For Patrice's final act, he plays a recording of RÃ©mi and himself from 1985, then sings a song he has written about RÃ©mi and the accident. When the audience applauds the song, he criticises them as <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be a famous comedian. After imitating a marionette, he performs his curtain call with a toy dragon; he dances with it and a sparkler, and flaps its wings to Johann Strauss I's Radetzky March.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill was}} {{carried over into}} the 2010 session and Lingle stated in January 2010 that the bill was a {{distraction}} from the budget {{and should not be}} voted on for final passage in the Senate. Senator Brian Taniguchi argued the legislature could work on several issues simultaneously and the bill would pass. If passed, the amended bill would have to be approved by the House of Representatives. Speaker of the House Calvin Say stated that a vote on the bill would depend on whether the Senate passed the bill with enough votes to override a gubernatorial veto, arguing that <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> force a vote on controversial legislation in an election year if the bill's approval was in doubt. The Senate bill contains an effective date of January 1, 2010, and if the language is not changed, the bill could be vetoed regardless of its content.|$|E

Inside, they find an alien ship housing a primitive time engine. The ship crashed some time ago and has used a perception filter to disguise itself as part of Craig's house. The ship's emergency holographic program has been drawing in passersby, all who have a desire to escape, to find a replacement pilot for itself, but they were killed in the attempt. The machine identifies the Doctor as a possible pilot and tries to draw him to the controls, but the Doctor warns that if he should touch the controls, the ship could explode and take the solar system with it. The Doctor convinces Craig to touch the controls since <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> leave due to his love for Sophie, which will counteract the ship's protocols. Craig does so, and he and Sophie admit their love and share a kiss that breaks the ship's hold on the Doctor and themselves.
