6000|$|This also, as I hinted {{but just}} before, shews both {{the power of}} them that hate us, and the {{inability}} of us to resist. The power that is set against us none can crush, and break, but God: {{for it is the}} power of devils, of sin, of death, and hell. But we for our parts are crushed before the moth: being a shadow, a vapour, and a wind that passes away (Job 4:19). Oh! how should we, and <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>we,</b> were but our eyes awake, stand and wonder at the preservations, the deliverances, the salvations and benefits with which we are surrounded daily: while so many mighty evils seek daily to swallow us up, as the grave. See how the golden psalm of David reads it. [...] "Be merciful unto me, O God; for man would swallow me up; he fighting daily oppresseth me. Mine enemies would daily swallow me up: for they be many that fight against me, O thou most high" [...] (Psa 56:1,2). This is at the beginning of it. And he concludes it thus, [...] "Thou hast delivered my soul from death: will not thou deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God {{in the light of the}} living" [...] (verse 13).|$|E

Nay further, {{it is so}} {{unreasonable}} a {{thing for}} a sinner to refuse the gospel, that the very devils themselves will come in against thee, as well as Sodom, that damned crew. May not they, I say, come in against thee, and say, O thou simple[33] man! O vile wretch! That had not so much care of thy soul, thy precious soul, as the beast hath of its young, or the dog of the very bone that lieth before him. Was thy soul worth so much, and didst thou so little regard it? Were the thunder-claps of the law so terrible, and didst thou so slight them? Besides, was the gospel so freely, so frequently, so fully tendered to thee, and yet hast thou rejected all these things? Hast thou valued sin {{at a higher rate}} than thy soul, than God, Christ, angels, saints, and communion with them in eternal blessedness and glory? Wast thou not told of hell-fire, those intolerable flames? Didst thou never hear of the intolerable roarings of the damned ones that are therein? Didst thou never hear or read that doleful saying in Luke 16, how the sinful man cries out among the flames, 'One drop of water to cool my tongue?' Thus, I say, may the very devils, being ready to go with thee into the burning furnace of fire and brimstone, though not for sins of so high a nature as thine, trembling say, O that Christ had died for devils, as he died for man! And, O that the gospel had been preached to us as it hath been to thee! <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>we</b> have laboured to have closed in with it! But woe be to us, for we might never have it proffered; no, not in the least, though we would have been glad of it. But you, you have it proffered, preached, and proclaimed unto you (Prov 8:4). Besides, you have been intreated, and beseeched to accept of it, but you would not. O simple fools! that might have escaped wrath, vengeance, hell-fire, and that to all eternity, and had no heart at all to do it.|$|E

5000|$|According to Chapter 5, Howard C. Cutler also asks The Dalai Lama a {{question}} about connections and relationships between people: [...] "What would you say {{is the most effective}} method or technique of connecting with others in a meaningful way and of reducing conflicts with others?" [...] The Dalai Lama says that there is no formula or exact example for all problems.(87) The Dalai Lama believes that empathy is the key to be more warm and compassionate in connections to others. He thinks that it is very important and extremely helpful to be able to try to put ourselves in the other person's place and see <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>we</b> react to the situation.(89) To show compassion and try to understand the background of other people. Cutler also writes a few stories/experiences from his life. For instance when he was in an argument with someone and his reaction was inappropriate without trying to understand and appreciate what the other person might think - no empathy.|$|E
5000|$|Some theorists (such as Dirac and Milne) have {{proposed}} cosmologies that conjecture that physical [...] "constants" [...] might actually {{change over time}} (e.g. a variable speed of light or Dirac varying-G theory). Such cosmologies have not gained mainstream acceptance {{and yet there is}} still considerable scientific interest in the possibility that physical [...] "constants" [...] might change, although such propositions introduce difficult questions. Perhaps the first question to address is: How would such a change make a noticeable operational difference in physical measurement or, more fundamentally, our perception of reality? If some particular physical constant had changed, <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>we</b> notice it, how would physical reality be different? Which changed constants result in a meaningful and measurable difference in physical reality?
