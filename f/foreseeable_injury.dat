50|$|Dr Chris Johnstone was {{a junior}} doctor in the Obstetric Department at the University College Hospital. According to para 4(b) of his contract, he was {{expected}} to be available on call for 48 hours a week on average, on top of his 40-hour contract. His first claim was that it was a breach of the duty of care to have a contract which could cause <b>foreseeable</b> <b>injury.</b> His alternative claim was that the clause allowing him to be so long on call was contrary to the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 section 2(1).|$|E
5000|$|In the {{criminal}} law, at common law, {{there was no}} general duty of care owed to fellow citizens. The traditional view was encapsulated in the example of watching a person drown in shallow water and making no rescue effort, where commentators borrowed the line, [...] "Thou shalt not kill but needst not strive, officiously, to keep another alive." [...] (Arthur Hugh Clough (1819-1861)) {{in support of the}} proposition that the failure to act does not attract criminal liability. Nevertheless, such failures might be morally indefensible and so both legislatures and the courts have imposed liability when the failure to act is sufficiently blameworthy to justify criminalisation. Some statutes therefore explicitly state that the actus reus consists of any relevant [...] "act or omission", or use a word that may include both. Hence, the word [...] "cause" [...] may be both positive {{in the sense that the}} accused proactively injured the victim and negative in that the accused intentionally failed to act knowing that this failure would cause the relevant injury. In the courts, the trend has been to use objective tests to determine whether, in circumstances where there would have been no risk to the accused's health or well-being, the accused should have taken action to prevent a <b>foreseeable</b> <b>injury</b> being sustained by a particular victim or one from a class of potential victims.|$|E
50|$|This issue {{appeared}} repeatedly until MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co. (1916), a case {{analogous to}} Winterbottom v Wright involving a car's defective wheel. Judge Cardozo, {{writing for the}} New York Court of Appeals, decided that no privity is required when the manufacturer knows the product is probably dangerous if defective, third parties (e.g. consumers) will be harmed because of said defect, {{and there was no}} further testing after initial sale. <b>Foreseeable</b> <b>injuries</b> occurred from <b>foreseeable</b> uses. Cardozo's innovation was to decide that the basis for the claim was that it was a tort not a breach of contract. In this way he finessed the problems caused by the doctrine of privity in a modern industrial society. Although his opinion was only law in New York State, the solution he advanced was widely accepted elsewhere and formed the basis of the doctrine of product liability.|$|R
5000|$|At trial, {{the court}} held that the hotel {{violated}} a common law duty of care to protect patrons from [...] "danger of personal <b>injury,</b> <b>foreseeable</b> {{as a result of the}} eviction". The duty, the trial judge found, could have easily been discharged by calling the police or arrange for a safe way home.|$|R
50|$|The {{next step}} after Dillon {{was to make}} {{optional}} the element of another person (so that the injury could be to anything {{where it would be}} reasonably <b>foreseeable</b> that such <b>injury</b> would cause some person emotional distress). The first such case was Rodrigues v. State, in which the Supreme Court of Hawaii held that plaintiffs could recover for negligent infliction of emotional distress as a result of negligently caused flood damage to their home. This is generally considered to be the true birth of NIED as a separate tort.|$|R

2500|$|Five {{days after}} her husband Vernon Hunter's death, Valerie Hunter filed a {{wrongful}} death lawsuit against Sheryl Mann Stack, Andrew Joseph Stack's widow in federal District Court. The lawsuit alleges that Sheryl had a duty to [...] "avoid a <b>foreseeable</b> risk of <b>injury</b> to others," [...] including her late husband and {{failed to do so}} by not warning others about her late husband. [...] The lawsuit also mentions that Stack was required by law to fly his plane at an altitude [...] above the highest obstacle.

40|$|Case note on Sheehy v Hobbs [2012]. It is well {{established}} that a landlord owes a tenant a duty of care to “take reasonable care to avoid <b>foreseeable</b> risk of <b>injury</b> to their prospective tenants and members of their household”. 1 What often arises {{is the question of}} how far the scope of that duty extends. In Sheehy v Hobbs [2012] QSC 333 the plaintiff was injured when she fell down a flight of internal stairs of the townhouse she leased from the defendants. The plaintiff claimed damages for a breach of duty owed to her in negligence, and also alleged breaches of the duties owed to her pursuant to s 103 of the Residential Tenancies Act 1994 (Qld) and her tenancy agreement...|$|R
40|$|Very low {{temperatures}} create conditions that can preserve tissue for centuries, possibly in-cluding the neurological {{basis of the}} human mind. Through a process called vitrification, brain tissue can be cooled to cryogenic temperatures without ice formation. Damage associ-ated with this process is theoretically reversible {{in the same sense}} that rejuvenation is theo-retically possible by specific <b>foreseeable</b> technology. <b>Injury</b> to the brain due to stopped blood flow is now known to result from a complex series of processes that take much longer to run to completion than the 6 min limit of ordinary resuscitation technology. Reperfusion beyond the 6 min limit primarily damages blood vessels rather than brain tissue. Apoptosis of neu-rons takes many hours. This creates a window of opportunity between legal death and irre-trievable loss of life for human and animal subjects for cryopreservation with possibility of future resuscitation. Under ideal conditions, the time interval between onset of clinical death and beginning of cryonics procedures can be reduced to less than 1 min, but much longer de-lays could also be compatible with ultimate survival. Although the evidence that cryonics may work is indirect, the application of indirect evidence is essential in many areas of sci-ence. If complex changes due to aging are reversible at some future date, then similarly com-plex changes due to stopped blood flow and cryopreservation may also be reversible, with life-saving results for anyone with medical needs that exceed current capabilities. 49...|$|R
40|$|Because of the negligent {{supervision}} {{of one of}} its habitually violent intensive supervision probationers, the State of Nebraska allowed DaNell Bartunek to become the victim of a violent, knife-wielding attempted rape by her former boyfriend. This violent sexual assault followed a pattern of abuse and stalking directed at Bartunek, which the State knew about and had the ability to end by adequately controlling its probationer; however, the State did not intervene before the attack. The Nebraska Supreme Court has now decided that the State will not be held accountable for its lack of supervision and that Bartunek must bear the full cost of her preventable and <b>foreseeable</b> <b>injuries.</b> In Bartunek v. State, the Court missed an opportunity to impose a narrowly defined yet workable duty on the state probation system to act with reasonable care while supervising violent felons on intensive supervision probation (“ISP”). This Note argues that the Court’s rejection of any such duty was incorrect. Part II sets forth the factual background of the Bartunek case and summarizes the disposition of the case in the district court and Nebraska Supreme Court. Part III analyzes the Nebraska Supreme Court’s opinion from social and legal perspectives: section III. A discusses the social context in which Bartunek occurred, and section III. B analyzes opportunities for imposing a duty in Bartunek. This Note presents four constructions of a legal duty to Bartunek, two of which the Nebraska Supreme Court rejected and two of which it failed to discuss. The Bartunek court rejected any duty based on a special relationship between the State and its probationer under section 315 (a). It also overlooked a section 315 (a) “identifiable victim” duty grounded in Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of California and its progeny. In addition, the Bartunek court rejected any duty based on a special relationship between the State and the victim, and in doing so, the court narrowly interpreted detrimental reliance under section 315 (b). The court also overlooked a duty grounded in Brandon v. County of Richardson, based on Bartunek’s aid to the State in reporting violations of probation committed against her. In Part IV I suggest that in a case like Bartunek, several sensible options exist for imposing a narrowly defined legal duty. Such a duty would take account of victim safety issues associated with violent offenders on probation who are also perpetrators of intimate partner violence and whose criminal history and behavior while on probation indicate a propensity for further violence. Because no duty was found in Bartunek, probation officers can continue to act negligently as they supervise high-risk probationers. There is no remedy for victims of this negligent conduct, nor any incentive for probation officers to act reasonably. Finding “no duty” denies that the dynamics of domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking are not only pervasive cultural problems but also crimes and predictable elements of the behavior of certain probationers. The resulting public policy allows for the reckless, unnecessary endangerment of victims of ISP probationers and is contrary to the intent of the Nebraska Legislature in curtailing state immunity...|$|R
5000|$|The Court of Appeal {{delivered}} its {{judgment on}} 6 April 1977. Geoffrey Lane and Cumming-Bruce LJJ held {{that there was}} a <b>foreseeable</b> risk of <b>injury</b> to the plaintiffs and their property from the cricket balls and the club could not prevent accidents from happening. The club was guilty of negligence [...] "on each occasion when a ball comes over the fence and causes damage to the plaintiffs". [...] The repeated interference with their property was also held to be an actionable nuisance. Following Sturges v. Bridgman, the fact that the Millers had [...] "come to the nuisance" [...] was no defence. On that basis, the Millers were awarded damages. Lord Denning MR dissented from the finding of negligence and nuisance, holding that [...] "the public interest should prevail over the private interest". [...] However, on the basis that the club had agreed to pay for any damage, Lord Denning was [...] "content that there should be an award of £400 to cover any past or future damage".|$|R
5000|$|Although some {{courts have}} on {{occasion}} adopted a more restrictive approach, {{the decision of}} the Lords in Jolley v Sutton London Borough Council, suggests that the liberal approach is to be preferred. The council allowed an abandoned boat to remain on its land and, over a period of time, two boys began to paint and repair it. Unfortunately, the boat fell on one of the boys, seriously injuring him. The claimant's case was that the boat represented a trap or allurement. The council accepted that it had been negligent in not removing the boat but that it had not been foreseeable that two boys would try to jack up the boat and so move it from the cradle upon which it lay. Lords Steyn and Hoffman stated that {{it is not necessary to}} foresee the precise injury that occurred, but injury of a given description. [...] "The foreseeability is not as to the particulars but the genus. And the description is formulated by reference to the nature of the risk that ought to have been foreseen." [...] (at para 37) So, in Hughes it was foreseeable that a child might be injured by falling in the hole or being burned by a lamp or by a combination of both. Although the injuries were not actually sustained in a <b>foreseeable</b> way, the <b>injuries</b> that actually materialised fell within the predictable range. Thus, the Wagon Mound No.2 and Hughes are compatible. The former alleged that damage by burning was not damage of a description that could reasonably have been foreseen, while the latter asserted that the injury was not reasonably foreseeable. In both cases, the claimants could recover damages.|$|R
40|$|In Domagala v. Rolland, the Minnesota Supreme Court granted {{review in}} a {{personal}} injury case that was dominated by duty and special relationship issues, even though the parties agreed {{that there was no}} special relationship between them. The case, straddling the misfeasance/nonfeasance line, was complicated by the defense theory (that the lack of a special relationship meant that the defendant owed no duty to protect or warn the plaintiff), and the plaintiff’s theory (that the defendant owed a duty of reasonable care to the plaintiff because he acted affirmatively, even if the risk to the plaintiff did not become apparent until later). At trial, the result was a set of conflicting and inconsistent jury instructions that in effect permitted Domagala to prove that Rolland was negligent, except not by either failing to warn or protect Domagala. The result was a defense verdict. Domagala appealed. The court of appeals rejected the defense’s theory, accepted the plaintiff’s, and remanded the case for a new trial. The supreme court rejected both theories, concluding that a duty existed because the defendant affirmatively created a <b>foreseeable</b> risk of <b>injury</b> to the plaintiff, and affirmed the court of appeals’s decision to remand the case for a new trial. This article takes a close look at Domagala. It sets out the facts, the jury instructions given by the district court, and the dilemma the instructions created for Domagala in trying to prove that Rolland was negligent without establishing that Rolland should have warned or protected him. An analysis of the court of appeals and supreme court opinions follows, including the lessons from,and questions and red flags raised by, the supreme court’s opinion. The last part is a simple conclusion...|$|R
