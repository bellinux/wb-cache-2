5|$|As {{mentioned}} above, Schubert's last sonatas {{have long}} been historically neglected, dismissed as inferior in style to Beethoven's piano sonatas. However, the negative view has changed during the late twentieth century, and today these works are usually praised for their conveying of an idiosyncratic, personal Schubertian style, indeed quite different from Beethoven's, but holding its own virtues. In this mature style, the Classical perception of harmony and tonality, and the treatment of musical structure, are radically altered, <b>generating</b> <b>a</b> new, distinct type of sonata form.|$|E

5|$|Enzymes {{that contain}} a {{catalytic}} triad {{use it for}} one of two reaction types: either to split a substrate (hydrolases) or to transfer one portion of a substrate over to a second substrate (transferases). Triads are an inter-dependent set of residues in the active site of an enzyme and act in concert with other residues (e.g. binding site and oxyanion hole) to achieve nucleophilic catalysis. These triad residues act together to make the nucleophile member highly reactive, <b>generating</b> <b>a</b> covalent intermediate with the substrate that is then resolved to complete catalysis.|$|E

The reviewer also praised Viralheat for its user interface and easy cross-posting across different social networks, but said its reporting and analytics were limited.

40|$|In recent years, the reuse {{of motion}} capture data has become widespread. For example, many methods to {{generate}} new motion by synthesizing plural existing motions has been suggested. We can <b>generate</b> <b>a</b> composite motion such as “Walk while waving a hand ” by using these methods. However, these methods often lose the feature of original data when they <b>generate</b> <b>a</b> new motion. Then, these methods <b>generate</b> <b>an</b> unnatural motion. In this paper, we propose a motion synthesizing method with motion splicing. We <b>generate</b> <b>a</b> new motion {{from the existing}} motion based on relation of master and servant in a composite motion. Our method <b>generates</b> <b>a</b> spliced motion by splicing a human part. We splice five parts that is the lower body, arms, the torso and the head. Our method generates plural spliced motions, and <b>generates</b> <b>a</b> new motion by synthesizing those motions.

5|$|The triad of {{cytomegalovirus}} protease uses histidine as {{both the}} acid and base triad members. Removing the acid histidine results in only a 10-fold activity loss (compared to >10,000-fold when aspartate is removed from chymotrypsin). This triad has been interpreted as a possible way of <b>generating</b> <b>a</b> less active enzyme to control cleavage rate.|$|E
5|$|A {{catalytic}} triad {{refers to}} the three amino acid residues that function together at {{the centre of the}} active site of some hydrolase and transferase enzymes (e.g. proteases, amidases, esterases, acylases, lipases and β-lactamases). An Acid-Base-Nucleophile triad is a common motif for <b>generating</b> <b>a</b> nucleophilic residue for covalent catalysis. The residues form a charge-relay network to polarise and activate the nucleophile, which attacks the substrate, forming a covalent intermediate which is then hydrolysed to regenerate free enzyme and release the product. The nucleophile is most commonly a serine or cysteine amino acid, but occasionally threonine. Because enzymes fold into complex three-dimensional structures, the residues of a catalytic triad can be far from each other along the amino-acid sequence (primary structure), however, they are brought close together in the final fold.|$|E

5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum largely reproduces asexually by {{branching}} {{rather than}} sexually through spores. While wind-blown spores {{can result in}} sexual reproduction for the species, most spores probably fall within a relatively short radius of the plant. In addition, reproduction through spore dispersal requires the spore to land in suitable conditions for <b>generating</b> <b>a</b> gametophyte, typically in bright sunlight on thin serpentine soils. These requirements allow A.viridimontanum to colonize recently disturbed sites on ultramafic outcrops, where bedrock has been exposed and competing plants have been removed. The populations appear stable, with the long life of individuals compensating for low recruitment rates.|$|E
5|$|Although {{capable of}} <b>generating</b> <b>a</b> high volume of fire, autocannon {{are limited by}} the amount of {{ammunition}} that can be carried by the weapons systems mounting them. For this reason, both the 25mm Bushmaster and the 30mm RARDEN are deliberately designed with relatively slow rates of fire, to extend the amount of time they can be employed on a battlefield before requiring a resupply of ammunition. The rate of fire of modern autocannon ranges from 90 rounds per minute, to 1,800 rounds per minute. Systems with multiple barrels—Gatling guns—can have rates of fire of several thousand rounds per minute; the fastest of these is the GSh-6-30K, which has a rate of fire of over 6,000rounds per minute.|$|E
5|$|Another torque is {{produced}} by the finite width of the contact patch and the lean of the tire in a turn. The portion of the contact patch towards {{the outside of the}} turn is actually moving rearward, with respect to the wheel's hub, faster {{than the rest of the}} contact patch, because of its greater radius from the hub. By the same reasoning, the inner portion is moving rearward more slowly. So the outer and inner portions of the contact patch slip on the pavement in opposite directions, <b>generating</b> <b>a</b> torque that tends to turn the front wheel in the direction of the turn, and therefore tends to decrease the turn radius.|$|E
