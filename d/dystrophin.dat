25|$|<b>Dystrophin</b> {{protein is}} found in muscle fibre membrane; its helical nature allows it {{to act like a}} spring or shock absorber. <b>Dystrophin</b> links actin in the {{cytoskeleton}} and dystroglycans of the muscle cell plasma membrane, known as the sarcolemma (extracellular). In addition to mechanical stabilization, <b>dystrophin</b> also regulates calcium levels.|$|E
25|$|Becker muscular {{dystrophy}} is an X-linked recessive inherited disorder characterized by slowly progressive muscle {{weakness of the}} legs and pelvis. It {{is a type of}} dystrophinopathy. This is caused by mutations in the <b>dystrophin</b> gene, which encodes the protein <b>dystrophin.</b> Becker {{muscular dystrophy}} is related to Duchenne muscular dystrophy in that both result from a mutation in the <b>dystrophin</b> gene.|$|E
25|$|Immunosuppressant steroids {{have been}} known to help slow the {{progression}} of Becker muscular dystrophy. The drug prednisone contributes to an increased production of the protein utrophin which closely resembles <b>dystrophin,</b> the protein that is defective in BMD.|$|E
25|$|RNAP can {{initiate}} transcription {{at specific}} DNA sequences known as promoters. It then produces an RNA chain, which is complementary to the template DNA strand. The process of adding nucleotides to the RNA strand {{is known as}} elongation; in eukaryotes, RNAP can build chains as long as 2.4 million nucleotides (the full length of the <b>dystrophin</b> gene). RNAP will preferentially release its RNA transcript at specific DNA sequences encoded {{at the end of}} genes, which are known as terminators.|$|E
25|$|Genomic {{analysis}} {{suggests that there}} is a global division in Neanderthal introgression between Sub-Saharan African populations and other modern human groups (including North Africans) rather than between African and non-African populations. North African groups share a similar excess of derived alleles with Neanderthals as do non-African populations, whereas Sub-Saharan African groups are the only modern human populations that generally did not experience Neanderthal admixture. The Neanderthal genetic signal among North African populations was found to vary depending on the relative quantity of autochthonous North African, European, Near Eastern and Sub-Saharan ancestry. Using f4 ancestry ratio statistical analysis, the Neanderthal inferred admixture was observed to be: highest among the North African populations with maximal autochthonous North African ancestry such as Tunisian Berbers, where it was at the same level or even higher than that of Eurasian populations (100–138%); high among North African populations carrying greater European or Near Eastern admixture, such as groups in North Morocco and Egypt (∼60–70%); and lowest among North African populations with greater Sub-Saharan admixture, such as in South Morocco (20%). Quinto et al. (2012) therefore postulate that the presence of this Neanderthal genetic signal in Africa is not due to recent gene flow from Near Eastern or European populations since it is higher among populations bearing indigenous pre-Neolithic North African ancestry. The Neanderthal-linked haplotype B006 of the <b>dystrophin</b> gene has also been found among nomad pastoralist groups in the Sahel and Horn of Africa, who are associated with northern populations. Consequently, the presence of this B006 haplotype on the northern and northeastern perimeter of Sub-Saharan Africa is attributed to gene flow from a non-African point of origin. Low but significant rates of Neanderthal admixture has also been observed for the Maasai of East Africa. After identifying African and non-African ancestry among the Maasai, it can be concluded that recent non-African modern human (post-Neanderthal) gene flow was the source of the contribution since around an estimated 30% of the Maasai genome can be traced to non-African introgression from about 100 generations ago.|$|E
2500|$|A large {{variety of}} {{proteins}} containing the WW domain are known. These include; <b>dystrophin,</b> a multidomain cytoskeletal protein; utrophin, a dystrophin-like protein; vertebrate YAP protein, substrate of LATS1 and LATS2 [...] serine-theronine kinases of the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway; Mus musculus (Mouse) NEDD4, {{involved in the}} embryonic development and differentiation of the central nervous system; Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast) RSP5, similar to NEDD4 in its molecular organization; Rattus norvegicus (Rat) FE65, a transcription-factor activator expressed preferentially in brain; Nicotiana tabacum (Common tobacco) DB10 protein, amongst others.|$|E
2500|$|Duchenne muscular {{dystrophy}} (DMD) is an X-linked disorder caused by defective production of <b>dystrophin.</b> [...] Many jurisdictions {{around the world}} have screened for, or attempted to screen for DMD using elevated levels of creatine kinase measured in dried blood spots. [...] Because universal newborn screening for DMD has not been undertaken, affected individuals often have a significant delay in diagnosis. [...] As treatment options for DMD become more and more effective, interest in adding a newborn screening test increases. [...] At various times since 1978, DMD has been included (often as a pilot study on a small subset of the population) in newborn screening programs in Edinburgh, Germany, Canada, France, Wales, Cyprus, Belgium and the United States. [...] In 2012, Belgium was the only country that continued to screen for DMD using creatine kinase levels.|$|E
2500|$|Size of protein-coding genes. The size of protein-coding genes {{within the}} human genome shows {{enormous}} variability (Table 2). The median size of a protein-coding gene is 26,288 bp (mean = 66,577 bp; Table 2 in [...] ). For example, the gene for histone H1a (HIST1HIA) is relatively small and simple, lacking introns and encoding mRNA sequences of 781 nt and a 215 amino acid protein (648 nt open reading frame). <b>Dystrophin</b> (DMD) is the largest protein-coding gene in the human reference genome, spanning a total of 2.2 MB, while Titin (TTN) has the longest coding sequence (114,414 bp), {{the largest number of}} exons (363), and the longest single exon (17,106 bp). Over the whole genome, the median size of an exon is 122 bp (mean = 145 bp), the median number of exons is 7 (mean = 8.8), and the median coding sequence encodes 367 amino acids (mean = 447 amino acids; Table 21 in [...] ).|$|E
50|$|Patients with Becker's muscular dystrophy, {{which is}} milder than DMD, have {{a form of}} <b>dystrophin</b> which is {{functional}} {{even though it is}} shorter than normal <b>dystrophin.</b> In 1990 England et al. noticed that a patient with mild Becker muscular dystrophy was lacking 46% of his coding region for <b>dystrophin.</b> This functional, yet truncated, form of <b>dystrophin</b> gave rise to the notion that shorter <b>dystrophin</b> can still be therapeutically beneficial. Concurrently, Kole et al. had modified splicing by targeting pre-mRNA with antisense oligonucleotides (AONs). Kole demonstrated success using splice-targeted AONs to correct missplicing in cells removed from beta-thalassemia patients Wilton's group tested exon skipping for muscular dystrophy. Successful preclinical research led to the current efforts to use splice-modifying oligos to change DMD <b>dystrophin</b> to a more functional form of <b>dystrophin,</b> in effect converting Duchenne MD into Becker MD.|$|E
50|$|Exon {{skipping}} is {{induced by}} eteplirsen, a charge-neutral, phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) that selectively binds to exon 51 of <b>dystrophin</b> pre-mRNA, restoring {{the phase of}} the reading frame and enabling production of functional, but truncated, <b>dystrophin.</b> The uncharged nature of the PMO helps make it resistant to biological degradation. This truncated <b>dystrophin</b> protein produced by eteplirsen causes a less severe form of dystrophinopathy, much like Becker muscular dystrophy. PMO technology to treat other genotypes amenable to exon skipping could potentially treat an estimated 70 to 80% of all DMD patients with <b>dystrophin</b> gene deletion. Eteplirsen's proposed mechanism of action is to bind to pre-mRNA {{needed to make a}} particular muscle protein, <b>dystrophin,</b> and rearrange the splicing of the RNA so that more <b>dystrophin</b> is made. By increasing the quantity of an abnormal, but potentially functional, <b>dystrophin</b> protein, the objective is to slow or prevent the progression of DMD.|$|E
5000|$|Eteplirsen is a morpholino {{antisense}} oligomer which triggers {{excision of}} exon 51 during pre-mRNA splicing of the <b>dystrophin</b> RNA transcript. Skipping exon 51 changes the downstream reading frame of dystrophin; giving eteplirsen {{to a healthy}} person would result in production of <b>dystrophin</b> mRNA which would not code for functional <b>dystrophin</b> protein but, for DMD patients with particular frameshifting mutations, giving eteplirsen can restore the reading frame of the <b>dystrophin</b> mRNA and result in production of functional (although modified by having an internal deletion consisting of both the patient's original defect, {{as well as the}} therapeutically skipped exon) <b>dystrophin.</b> [...] Eteplirsen is given by intravenous infusion for systemic treatment of DMD.|$|E

5000|$|... mir-31 {{has been}} linked to Duchenne muscular {{dystrophy}} − a genetic disorder characterised by a lack of the protein <b>dystrophin</b> − as a potential therapeutic target. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by mutations arising in the <b>dystrophin</b> gene, which impair the translation of <b>dystrophin</b> through the formation of premature termination codons.|$|E
50|$|In addition, the Cys-rich {{domains of}} <b>dystrophin,</b> utrophin and an 87kDa post-synaptic protein contain a ZZ-type zinc finger with high {{sequence}} identity to P300/CBP ZZ-type zinc fingers. In <b>dystrophin</b> and utrophin, the ZZ-type zinc finger lies between a WW domain (flanked by and EF hand) and the C-terminal coiled-coil domain. <b>Dystrophin</b> {{is thought to}} act as a link between the actin cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix, and perturbations of the dystrophin-associated complex, for example, between <b>dystrophin</b> and the transmembrane glycoprotein beta-dystroglycan, may lead to muscular dystrophy. <b>Dystrophin</b> and its autosomal homologue utrophin interact with beta-dystroglycan via their C-terminal regions, which are composed of a WW domain, an EF hand domain, and a ZZ-type zinc finger domain. The WW domain is the primary site of interaction between <b>dystrophin</b> or utrophin and dystroglycan, while the EF hand and ZZ-type zinc finger domains stabilise and strengthen this interaction.|$|E
50|$|Utrophin {{expression}} is dramatically increased {{in patients with}} Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (and female carriers), both in those muscle fibers lacking <b>dystrophin</b> and in rare, revertant fibers that express <b>dystrophin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Though {{its role}} in airway smooth muscle is not well established, recent {{research}} indicates that <b>dystrophin</b> along with other subunits of <b>dystrophin</b> glycoprotein complex is associated with phenotype maturation.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dystrophin</b> is a large, {{rod-like}} cytoskeletal protein {{found at}} the inner surface of muscle fibers. <b>Dystrophin</b> is missing in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy patients and is present in reduced amounts in Becker Muscular Dystrophy patients.

This gene {{is a member of}} the syntrophin gene family, which contains at least two other structurally related genes.|$|E
50|$|A 2009 {{study has}} shown {{additional}} benefits of HACs, namely {{their ability to}} stably contain extremely large genomic fragments. Researchers incorporated the 2.4 Mb <b>dystrophin</b> gene, in which a mutation is a key causal element of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The resulting HAC was mitotically stable, and correctly expressed <b>dystrophin</b> in chimeric mice. Previous attempts at correctly expressing <b>dystrophin</b> have failed. Due to its large size, it has never before been successfully integrated into a vector.|$|E
50|$|DMD {{is caused}} by a {{mutation}} of the <b>dystrophin</b> gene at locus Xp21, located on the short arm of the X chromosome. <b>Dystrophin</b> is responsible for connecting the cytoskeleton of each muscle fiber to the underlying basal lamina (extracellular matrix), through a protein complex containing many subunits. The absence of <b>dystrophin</b> permits excess calcium to penetrate the sarcolemma (the cell membrane). Alterations in calcium and signalling pathways cause water to enter into the mitochondria, which then burst.|$|E
50|$|Coxsackievirus shows {{a cardiac}} tropism {{partly due to}} the high {{expression}} of coxsackievirus and adenoviris receptors (CAR) in cardiomyocytes. Coxsackievirus B genome is approximately 7.4 Kb and translated as a polycistronic polyprotein. Upon translation, the polyprotein is cleaved by two essential viral proteases, 2A and 3C. The viral protease 2A cleaves the proteins in a sequence specific manner. These viral proteases can also act on host proteins exerting negative effects on the residing cell. Enteroviral protease 2A can cleave the cytoskeletal <b>dystrophin</b> protein in cardiomyocytes disrupting the <b>dystrophin</b> glycoprotein (DCG) complex. The cleavage site of <b>dystrophin</b> by protease 2A occurs in the hinge 3 region of the protein resulting a disruption of DCG complex and loss of sarcolemma integrity and increasing myocyte permeability. This eventually results in similar cardiac deformities observed in dilated cardiomyopathy caused by hereditary defects in <b>dystrophin</b> in DMD patients. Additionally, <b>dystrophin</b> deficiency has been shown to increase the severity in dilated cardiomyopathy in a mouse model for DMD. The increased susceptibility of <b>dystrophin</b> deficient heart to coxsackievirus-induced dilated cardiomyopathy is attributed to more efficient release of the virus from infected cells resulting an increased in viral-mediated cytopathic effects.|$|E
50|$|Ezutromid is an orally {{administered}} small molecule utrophin modulator currently {{involved in}} a Phase 2 clinical trial produced by Summit Therapeutics {{for the treatment of}} Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). DMD is a fatal x-liked recessive disease affecting approximately 1 in 5000 males and is a designated orphan disease by the FDA and European Medicines Agency. Approximately 1/3 of the children obtain DMD as a result of spontaneous mutation in the <b>dystrophin</b> gene and have no family history of the disease. <b>Dystrophin</b> is a vital component of mature muscle function, and therefore DMD patients have multifarious forms of defunct or deficient <b>dystrophin</b> proteins that all manifest symptomatically as muscle necrosis and eventually organ failure. Ezutromid is theorized to maintain utrophin, a protein functionally and structurally similar to <b>dystrophin</b> that precedes and is replaced by <b>dystrophin</b> during development. Utrophin and <b>dystrophin</b> are reciprocally expressed, and are found in different locations in a mature muscle cell. However, in dystrophin-deficient patients, utrophin was found to be upregulated and is theorized to replace <b>dystrophin</b> in order to maintain muscle fibers. Ezutromid is projected to have the potential to treat all patients suffering with DMD as it maintains the production of utrophin to counteract the lack of <b>dystrophin</b> to retard muscle degeneration. Both the FDA and European Medicines Agency has given ezutromid an orphan drug designation. The FDA Office of Orphan Products and Development offers an Orphan Drug Designation program (ODD) that allows drugs aimed to treat diseases that affect less than 200,000 people in the U.S. monetary incentives such as a period of market exclusivity, tax incentives, and expedited approval processes.|$|E
50|$|Duchenne muscular {{dystrophy}} (DMD) is caused when a mutation in the <b>dystrophin</b> gene changes the RNA {{so that it}} no longer codes for functional <b>dystrophin</b> protein. This usually happens due to a mutation that alters the reading frame of the RNA downstream of the mutation, so-called frameshift mutation. If an exon with an appropriate number of bases lies near the mutation, removing that exon can correct the downstream reading frame, restoring the production of partially functional <b>dystrophin.</b> This is the general strategy used in the design of exon-skipping oligonucleotides for DMD. As there are 79 exons in the longest splice form of the <b>dystrophin</b> transcript, many different oligonucleotides are needed to address the range of mutations present in the population of people with DMD.|$|E

50|$|Drisapersen (also {{known as}} Kyndrisa, PRO051 and GSK2402968) is an {{experimental}} drug that was under development by BioMarin, after acquisition of Prosensa, {{for the treatment}} of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

50|$|The protein encoded by {{this gene}} is a {{component}} of the cytoskeleton. Utrophin was found during research into Duchenne's muscular dystrophy. The name is a contraction for ubiquitous <b>dystrophin.</b> The 900 kb gene for utrophin is found on the long arm of human chromosome 6. Utrophin was discovered due to its homology with <b>dystrophin.</b> It was found by screening a peptide containing the C-terminal domain of <b>dystrophin</b> against cDNA libraries. The homology varies over its full length from less than 30% in regions of the central rod structural domain, to 85% (identity 73%) for the actin binding domain.|$|E
50|$|The genetic {{mutation}} {{that leads to}} Becker muscular dystrophy is an in-frame deletion. This means that, out of the 79 exons that code for <b>dystrophin,</b> one or several in the middle may be removed, without affecting the exons that follow the deletion. This allows for a shorter-than-normal <b>dystrophin</b> protein that maintains a degree of functionality. In Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the {{genetic mutation}} is out-of-frame. Out-of-frame mutations cause a premature stop in protein generation - the ribosome is unable to “read” the RNA {{past the point of}} initial error - leading to a severely shortened and completely non-functional <b>dystrophin</b> protein.|$|E
5000|$|... miR-31 {{overexpression}} is {{more abundant}} in human Duchenne muscular dystrophy than in healthy controls, with levels remaining high only in Duchenne muscular dystrophy myoblasts. miR-31 levels in healthy controls are instead decreased {{with the onset}} of cell differentiation. miR-31 is part of the circuit controlling late muscle differentiation by repression of <b>dystrophin</b> synthesis, and its expression is localised specifically to regenerating myoblasts of dystrophic muscles. miR-31 is believed to repress the expression of <b>dystrophin</b> by antisense binding of the <b>dystrophin</b> mRNA 3' untranslated region, and in this way it is thought that miR-31 manipulation could aid treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.|$|E
50|$|Exon {{skipping}} {{is being}} heavily researched {{for the treatment}} of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), where the muscular protein <b>dystrophin</b> is prematurely truncated, which leads to a non-functioning protein.

50|$|Two {{kinds of}} {{antisense}} oligos, 2'-O-methyl phosphorothioate oligos (like drisapersen) and Morpholino oligos (like eteplirsen), {{have been tested}} in clinical trials for DMD and have restored some <b>dystrophin</b> expression in muscles of DMD patients with a particular class of DMD-causing mutations. Clinical trials are ongoing, with one oligo targeting <b>dystrophin</b> exon 51 (eteplirsen) approved by the US FDA.|$|E

On a standard test, the 6-minute walk test, patients whose performance had been declining instead improved, from 385 meters to 420 meters. DMD may result from mRNA that contains out-of-frame mutations (e.g. deletions, insertions or splice site mutations), resulting in frameshift or early termination so that in most muscle fibers no functional <b>dystrophin</b> is produced (though some revertant muscle fibers produce some <b>dystrophin).</b> In many cases an antisense oligonucleotide {{can be used to}} trigger skipping of an adjacent exon to restore the reading frame and production of partially functional <b>dystrophin.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The loss of <b>dystrophin</b> {{results in}} muscular dystrophy.
