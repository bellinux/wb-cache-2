5|$|Mesa Verdeans {{typically}} harvested local small game, {{but sometimes}} organized hunting parties that traveled long distances. Their {{main sources of}} animal protein came from mule deer and rabbits, but they occasionally hunted Bighorn sheep, antelope, and elk. They began to domesticate turkeys starting around 1000, and by the 13th century consumption of the animal peaked, supplanting deer as the primary protein source at many sites. These domesticated turkeys consumed large amounts of corn, which further deepened reliance on the staple crop. Puebloans wove blankets <b>from</b> <b>turkey</b> feathers and rabbit fur, and made implements such as awls and needles <b>from</b> <b>turkey</b> and deer bones. Despite the availability of fish in the area's rivers and streams, archaeological evidence suggests that they were rarely eaten.|$|E

40|$|The genome electropherotyping {{technique}} {{was used in}} longitudinal surveys to detect group A rotavirus, rotaviruslike virus (RVLV), atypical rotavirus (ATR), and reovirus in intestinal contents or fecal specimens collected <b>from</b> <b>turkeys</b> in 10 commercial and 2 research station flocks. These viruses were detected in <b>turkeys</b> <b>from</b> 8 to 10 commercial flocks surveyed. Of 278 specimens collected <b>from</b> <b>turkeys</b> less then 29 days old in commercial flocks, 79 (28. 4 %) contained one or more viruses, whereas only 1 of 120 specimens collected <b>from</b> <b>turkeys</b> older than 28 days had virus. Viruses were detected in commercial turkeys between 3 and 35 days old, and {{over a third of}} the specimens collected from birds during their first week of life were positive for group A rotavirus. Between 8 and 28 days of age, commercial turkeys were infected with group A rotavirus, RVLV, ATR, and reovirus. ATR was the only virus detected in birds older than 28 days. Overall, group A rotavirus and RVLV were each detected in 39 specimens, and ATR was detected in 7 specimens; reovirus was detected in 2 specimens.

40|$|Escherichia coli {{isolates}} from septicemic or healthy {{chickens and}} <b>turkeys</b> <b>from</b> Quebec were serotyped, examined genotypically by using DNA probes specific for the pil and pap fimbrial {{systems and the}} aerobactin siderophore system, and examined phenotypically for lethality in day-old chicks, hemagglutination, serum resistance, and aerobactin production. Serogroups O 78 and O 1 were most common in septicemic chickens and <b>turkeys.</b> pap+ isolates <b>from</b> chickens were associated with septicemia, and pap+ isolates <b>from</b> <b>turkeys</b> were associated with lethality in day-old chicks. Four of nine pap+ isolates <b>from</b> septicemic <b>turkeys</b> expressed P adhesin, whereas all pap+ isolates from septicemic chickens were negative for P adhesin. The pil+ genotype was associated with septicemia in chickens and with serum resistance in isolates <b>from</b> <b>turkeys.</b> Mannose-sensitive hemagglutination of guinea pig erythrocytes was associated with septicemia in chickens and turkeys, although this phenotype {{was not associated with}} pil+ isolates <b>from</b> <b>turkeys.</b> Serum resistance was associated with isolates <b>from</b> septicemic <b>turkeys</b> and with lethality in isolates from chickens. The aerobactin system was associated with isolates from septicemic chickens and turkeys. Overall, results indicated that (i) genotypic examination may reveal virulence-associated traits which differ from the typically expected phenotype and/or are not readily expressed in vitro, and (ii) certain phenotypic and genotypic traits associated with E. coli causing extraintestinal disease in humans and animals are also associated with E. coli causing avian septicemia...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Examination of cecal {{contents}} or {{bacterial cultures}} thereof <b>from</b> <b>turkeys</b> fed either a high fiber (HF) or low fiber (LF) ration indicated that direct microscopic counts of microbes {{were significantly higher}} in HF-fed than in LF-fed birds. There {{was no significant difference}} in mean colony counts between the two groups of turkeys. In both LF and HF-fed birds, 77 % of the microbes were Gram-positive rods, 14 % Gram-negative rods, and 9 % Gram-positive cocci. The pre-dominant microorganism was Eubacterium, but Lactobacillus, Peptostreptococcus, Escherichia coli, Propionibacterium, and Bacteriodes were also isolated. Percentages of Peptostreptococcus were significantly greater in HF-fed turkeys and of E. coli were significantly greater in LF-fed turkeys. Yeasts were routinely found in both LF and HF-fed birds, but protozoa were not isolated. Turkeys fed the HF diet harbored significantly higher numbers of facultative microorganisms than did LF-fed birds. In pure cultures <b>from</b> <b>turkeys</b> preconditioned to a HF diet, there was a nonsignifi-cant trend toward greater cellulolysis than in pure cultures <b>from</b> LF-fed <b>turkeys.</b> In contrast, cellulolysis by mixed cultures from HF-fed birds was significantly greater than that in mixed cul-tures <b>from</b> LF-fed <b>turkeys...</b>|$|R
