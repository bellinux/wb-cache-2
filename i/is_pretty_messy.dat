5000|$|The {{production}} of Mezzanine was a stressful process, with tensions arising within the group. The album {{was meant to}} be released in December 1997, but was delayed by four months, with Del Naja spending most of the time in the studio [...] "making tracks, tearing them apart, [...] them up, panicking, then starting again." [...] Mezzanine <b>was</b> a <b>pretty</b> sketchy album in terms of the way we worked, because the band, as reported a lot at that time, were not getting on. So I'd be in the studio working with one of the members and someone else would come in, then the person I had been working with would leave and I'd have to change the track I was working on because they didn't want to work on that track, they wanted to work on something different. Sometimes I'd be working on perhaps four different tracks in one day, which <b>was</b> a <b>pretty</b> <b>messy</b> way to work. - Neil Davidge in an interview with Sound on Sound.|$|R
50|$|All {{was quiet}} until {{midway through the}} second quarter, where fullback Bruce Miller was caught holding in the endzone, the result {{of which was a}} safety, and a Seattle 2-0 lead. Later on, {{defensive}} end Cliff Avril strip sacked Kaepernick and K. J. Wright recovered for Seattle, the result of which was a Steven Hauschka 30-yard field goal. Halftime came with a small 5-0 Seahawks lead. The game <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> dark and <b>messy</b> at that point, the only bright side being Seattle running back Marshawn Lynch.|$|R

40|$|AbstractMisidentifying materials—such as mistaking soap for pâté, or vice versa—could {{lead to some}} <b>pretty</b> <b>messy</b> mishaps. Fortunately, {{we rarely}} suffer such indignities, thanks largely to our {{outstanding}} ability to recognize materials—and identify their properties—by sight. In everyday life, we encounter an enormous variety of materials, which we usually distinguish effortlessly and without error. However, despite its subjective ease, material perception poses the visual system with some unique and significant challenges, because a given material can take on many different appearances depending on the lighting, viewpoint and shape. Here, I use observations from recent research on material perception to outline a general theory of material perception, in which I suggest that the visual system does not actually estimate physical parameters of materials and objects. Instead—I argue—the brain is remarkably adept at building ‘statistical generative models’ that capture the natural degrees of variation in appearance between samples. For example, when determining perceived glossiness, the brain does not estimate parameters of the BRDF. Instead, it uses a constellation of low- and mid-level image measurements to characterize {{the extent to which}} the surface manifests specular reflections. I argue that these ‘statistical appearance models’ are both more expressive and easier to compute than physical parameters, and therefore represent a powerful middle way between a ‘bag of tricks’ and ‘inverse optics’...|$|R
