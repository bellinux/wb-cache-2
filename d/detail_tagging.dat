40|$|Abstract. The paper {{discusses}} two {{policies for}} recognizing NEs with complex structures by maximum entropy models. One {{policy is to}} develop cascaded MaxEnt models at different levels. The other is to design more <b>detailed</b> <b>tags</b> with human knowledge in order to represent complex structures. The experiments on Chinese organization names recognition indicate that layered structures result in more accurate models while extended tags can not lead to positive results as expected. We empirically prove that the {start, continue, end, unique, other} tag set is the best tag set for NE recognition with MaxEnt models. ...|$|R
5000|$|Scribing, {{also known}} as scratchitti, is a style or method of {{graffiti}} in which a scribe is used to tag on glass or plastic surfaces. There are two popular types of scribes. The first is the arrowhead scribe, held between the thumb and index finger, used for quick connectible-style tags on glass. The second is the pen scribe, usually used for more <b>detailed</b> <b>tagging.</b> Scribing can be loud, especially when doing connectibles on glass. Scribing differs from normal graffiti since scribing {{is almost impossible to}} remove. However, one strategy for [...] "removal" [...] is to make many more scratches on top of the existing tag.|$|R

See also an illustration of Brennos wearing a similar helmet.Around 150 BC, La Tène material disappears from the area. This coincides with the ancient writings which mention the rise of Dacian authority. It ended the Celtic domination, and it is possible that Celts were driven out of Dacia. Alternatively, some scholars have proposed that the Transylvanian Celts remained, but merged into the local culture and thus ceased to be distinctive.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, {{extensive}} catalogues and large repositories of educational content {{have been made}} available to schools, teachers and students. As the number of resources in these repositories continues to grow, the demand for better identification of resources is increasing: more precise and <b>detailed</b> <b>tagging</b> of resources is {{needed in order to}} enable teachers and learners quickly and easily search, find and access the needed learning materials. The problem of identification of resources and consequently more accurate search can be solved by using better and richer metadata. Since creation of needed metadata is long-lasting and complex procedure, approaches how to deal with this issue are presented in this article. Social tagging and automated metadata generation are examples of such approaches. The number of repositories that offer these resources is increasing as well, so extra attention is given to metadata exchange that provides a way to perform federated search. Since exchange between different systems can be made only by using standard formats, an insight of common standards is given as well...|$|R

40|$|This {{project has}} contributed to the ecologically {{sustainable}} management of the Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF) by providing information on the status of red-legged banana prawn stocks and the nursery habitats that support this fishery. It has achieved these outcomes by firstly completing <b>detailed</b> <b>tagging</b> studies to obtain robust estimates of growth and mortality for red-legged banana prawns. These estimates enabled per-recruit models for red-legged prawns to be revised and for the sustainability of the current fishing patterns to be assessed. The levels of estimated recruitment to the fishery are much lower than previously estimated and therefore the stocks may be more vulnerable to over-fishing than past assessments suggested. Secondly, broad-scale surveys across the inshore areas of the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf established that juvenile red-legged banana prawns are found in small, mangrove-lined creeks in the estuaries located 100 to 200 km south-east of the fishery (Fitzmaurice/Victoria Rivers to Cambridge Gulf). This means that changes in land-use that affect coastal habitats or water flow (e. g. the Ord River Stage II development) may affect the juvenile stages and the emigration of juveniles into the fishery...|$|R

40|$|Oleaginous {{microorganisms}} represent possible platforms for {{the sustainable}} production of oleochemicals and biofuels {{due to their}} metabolic robustness and the possibility to be engineered. Streptomyces coelicolor is among the narrow group of prokaryotes capable of accumulating triacylglycerol (TAG) as carbon and energy reserve. Although the pathways for TAG biosynthesis in this organism have been widely addressed, the set of genes required for their breakdown have remained elusive so far. Here, we identified and characterized three gene clusters involved in the β-oxidation of fatty acids (FA). The role {{of each of the}} three different S. coelicolor FadAB proteins in FA catabolism was confirmed by complementation of an Escherichia coliΔfadBA mutant strain deficient in β-oxidation. In S. coelicolor, the expression profile of the three gene clusters showed variation related with the stage of growth and the presence of FA in media. Flux balance analyses using a corrected version of the current S. coelicolor metabolic model containing <b>detailed</b> <b>TAG</b> biosynthesis reactions suggested the relevance of the identified fadAB genes in the accumulation of TAG. Thus, through the construction and analysis of fadAB knockout mutant strains, we obtained an S. coelicolor mutant that showed a 4. 3 -fold increase in the TAG content compared to the wild type strain grown under the same culture conditions...|$|R
40|$|Real-world brain imaging by EEG {{requires}} accurate annotation {{of complex}} subject-environment interactions in event-rich tasks and paradigms. This paper describes {{the evolution of}} the HED (Hierarchical Event Descriptor) system for systematically describing both laboratory and real-world events. HED version 2, first described here, provides the semantic capability of describing a variety of subject and environmental states. HED descriptions can include stimulus presentation events on screen or in virtual worlds, experimental or spontaneous events occurring in the real world environment, and events experienced via one or multiple sensory modalities. Furthermore, HED 2 can distinguish between the mere presence of an object and its actual (or putative) perception by a subject. Although the HED framework has implicit ontological and linked data representations, the user-interface for HED annotation is more intuitive than traditional ontological annotation. We believe that hiding the formal representations allows for a more user-friendly interface, making consistent, <b>detailed</b> <b>tagging</b> of experimental and real-world events possible for research users. HED is extensible while retaining the advantages of having an enforced common core vocabulary. We have developed a collection of tools to support HED tag assignment and validation; these are available at hedtags. org.

Given the limitations of existing data collection methodologies and the importance of detailed and timely data, alternative methods of landscape inventory should be trialled. Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) is revolutionising the sharing of Geographic Information and is increasingly used as a geo-temporal data source despite pertinent concerns regarding data quality. The research presented aims to explore the adequacy of using volunteered content in conjunction with authoritative data to produce a fit for purpose and deployable land cover product. This paper reports on an initial study which looked into the feasibility of utilising existing or incidental crowdsourced land cover data from OpenStreetMap and Geograph to enhance authoritative Ordnance Survey data for a trial area, Hampshire. The results indicate that there are highly <b>detailed</b> <b>tags</b> within crowd submitted content that could be harnessed to provide a greater level of detail and quality in land cover mapping. Up to 20 % of tags were spatially identical in the authoritative and crowd data sets and Geograph yielded over 300 unique land cover terms including many at species level. The distribution and temporal appropriateness of data is promising but spatially heterogeneous. Initial investigations into the business viability of using such data raised terminological consistency and a lack of interoperability with other data as limiting factors.

40|$|Single {{nucleotide}} polymorphisms (SNPs) {{have been}} proposed to be grouped into haplotype blocks harboring {{a limited number of}} haplotypes. Within each block, the portion of haplotypes is expected to be tagged by a selected subset of SNPs; however, none of the proposed selection algorithms have been definitive. To address this issue, we developed a tag SNP selection algorithm based on grouping of SNPs by the linkage disequilibrium (LD) coefficient r 2 and examined five genes in three ethnic populations—the Japanese, African Americans, and Caucasians. Additionally, we investigated ethnic diversity by characterizing 979 SNPs distributed throughout the genome. Our algorithm could spare 60 % of SNPs required for genotyping and limit the imprecision in allele-frequency estimation of nontag SNPs to 2 % on average. We discovered the presence of a mosaic pattern of LD plots within a conventionally inferred haplotype block. This emerged because multiple groups of SNPs with strong intragroup LD were mingled in their physical positions. The pattern of LD plots showed some similarity, but the <b>details</b> of <b>tag</b> SNPs were not entirely concordant among three populations.
