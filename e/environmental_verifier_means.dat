EMAS registered organisations commit themselves to evaluate, manage and improve their environmental performance. EMAS is open to every type of organisation eager to improve its environmental performance. It spans all economic and service sectors and is applicable worldwide. Currently, more than 4,400 organisations and more than 8,150 sites are EMAS registered.Only independent <b>environmental</b> <b>verifiers</b> that are accredited/licensed and supervised by government authorities (Accreditation or Licensing Bodies) are authorised to validate EMAS environmental statements.

40|$|A Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) grouping-proof {{protocol}} is {{to generate}} an {{evidence of the}} simultaneous existence {{of a group of}} tags and it has been applied to many different fields. For current grouping-proof protocols, there still exist some flaws such as low grouping-proof efficiency, being vulnerable to trace attack and information leakage. To improve the secure performance and efficiency, we propose a lightweight RFID grouping-proof protocol based on parallel mode and DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) mechanism. Our protocol involves multiple readers and multiple tag groups. During the grouping-proof period, one reader and one tag group are chosen by the <b>verifier</b> by <b>means</b> of DHCP mechanism. When only a part of the tags of the chosen group exist, the protocol can also give the evidence of their co-existence. Our protocol utilizes parallel communication mode between reader and tags so as to ensure its grouping-proof efficiency. It only uses Hash function to complete the mutual authentication among verifier, readers and tags. It can preserve the privacy of the RFID system and resist the attacks such as eavesdropping, replay, trace and impersonation. Therefore the protocol is secure, flexible and efficient. It only uses some lightweight operations such as Hash function and a pseudorandom number generator. Therefore it is very suitable to some low-cost RFID systems...|$|R

The study highlights the differential impact of poverty on men and women and provides a glimpse of the intrahousehold dynamics within poor fishing households. Findings in previous studies in both industrialized and developing countries that women work longer hours than men were corroborated. Women contribute at least 22 % to the household cash income and 40 % of the value of unpaid labour. Their contribution to the household cash income becomes larger than that of men's when the value of livestock is computed. Women's daily participation in productive activities, such as fish vending and shucking oyster and mussel, unwittingly puts them in a position of being <b>environmental</b> recorders and <b>verifiers</b> of the state of fishery resources. Because they are burdened with the responsibility of making ends meet, they are also confronted with the challenge of realizing the dream of sending their children to university to enable them to escape poverty. This alone makes women one of the strongest stakeholders in the sustainable development of fishery resources...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about methods for {{establishing}} semantic properties {{of programs and}} how those methods can be strengthened. Finding (semi-) algorithms for deciding semantic properties is a non-trivial task and such algorithms will, by necessity, give approximate answers. This means that for any property of interest, there is a spectrum of algorithms computing answers to various degrees of precision, ranging from computationally cheap, low-precision algorithms to expensive, potentially non-terminating algorithms with very high precision. Finding approximations precise enough to be useful, and {{that at the same}} time make the algorithms cheap enough, is a real challenge. In this thesis we consider program analysis and program verification, which are two approaches for establishing program properties with contrasting requirements regarding precision and cost. Common to these two approaches is the desire to move closer to the middle of the spectrum of algorithms. For algorithms formulated as program analyses, this means increasing their precision, and for algorithms formulated as program <b>verifiers,</b> it <b>means</b> making them terminate without user interaction for a larger set of programs. The work presented in this thesis can be divided into three parts. The first part investigates the impact a number of features have on the precision of a type-based program analysis for Haskell. The results presented, make it easier for a designer of a type-based program analysis to choose what features to add to the analysis in order to get sufficiently high precision. The second part concerns how program verification can be integrated with program analysis in order to make the verification cheaper and more automatic. We show how a program analysis can be embedded in the tactic language of a theorem prover to allow for a close integration of program analysis and verifi- cation. We also show, in particular, how a dependence analysis can be used in a theorem prover for Java to make the handling of loops more automatic. The third part concerns how type-based program analysis can be strengthened by plugging in additional, externally computed information. We do this by presenting a modular method for parameterizing type-based program analyses over information about the analyzed program’s execution. The parameterization is done in such a way that a modular proof of correctness is obtained, removing the need to prove correctness of each instantiation separately. We also show how our method of parameterization can be used to allow for flow-sensitive heap types by plugging in alias information...|$|R
