There are many benefits associated with sports fandom, including increased self-esteem and community solidarity. The activity of viewing sporting events provide shared experiences that reinforce personal and group identification with a team. The name, mascot, cheerleaders, and marching band performances reinforce and become associated with these shared experiences. The letter addressed to [...] "Everyone <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>Washington</b> Redskins Nation" [...] in 2013 by {{the owner of the}} Washington Redskins, Daniel Snyder; explicitly invokes these associations with family, friends, and an 81-year tradition as being the most important reasons for keeping a team name.|$|E

My father was of a dark complexion, with a very great forehead and dark hazel eyes, overhung by eyebrows which remained black long after his hair was white. His nose was aquiline, his smile extraordinary sweet. How well I remember it, and how little any description I can write can recall his image! He was of rather low stature, not being above five feet seven inches in height; he used to laugh at my sons, whom he called his crutches, and say they were grown too tall for him to lean upon. But small as he was he had a perfect grace and majesty of deportment, such as I have never seen in this country, except perhaps <b>in</b> <b>our</b> friend Mr. <b>Washington,</b> and commanded respect wherever he appeared.|$|R

40|$|Research {{indicates}} that younger siblings {{of children with}} autism are at higher risk {{for the development of}} autism and other developmental disorders (Silverman, 2001). As a result, many researchers have focused on younger siblings as a way of studying the emergence of autism prospectively. While this research has yielded many interesting findings, it is not known whether siblings are representative of singleton cases of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). ^ The current study used the M-CHAT (Robins, et al., 2001), a parent-report checklist, to detect ASD in 16 – 30 month old younger siblings of ASD probands. Three cohorts of children were compared: multiplex/younger siblings, an early intervention/high-risk singleton sample (EI), and a pediatrician screened/low-risk singleton sample (Peds). Two hundred and thirteen younger siblings, 583 EI toddlers, and 4281 Peds toddlers have been screened, {{with a mean age of}} 20 months for each group. Ninety-six younger siblings failed the screening and 78 of these also failed the telephone interview follow-up, and qualified for a developmental evaluation (mean age 23 months). Forty-eight of these siblings have been diagnosed with ASD, suggesting a recurrence rate of 22. 5 % <b>in</b> <b>our</b> sibling sample, with an ASD recurrence rate of 25 % <b>in</b> <b>our</b> University of Connecticut sample and 21 % <b>in</b> <b>our</b> University of <b>Washington</b> Sample. ^ With regards to severity of autism, our ASD sibling sample was similar to our singleton ASD sample on all diagnostic variables. However, our ASD sibling sample was higher functioning than our singleton ASD sample in adaptive skills (Vineland Socialization) and cognitive development (Mullen Visual Reception, Fine Motor, and Expressive Language). Although ascertainment bias may play a role in these differences, the data suggest that autism in multiplex families may be different from autism in singleton families and that caution is warranted when generalizing from development of affected younger siblings to development of autism in general. ...|$|R

It was the residence of Sir Laurence Washington, second son of the above-mentioned grantee of Sulgrave.

40|$|How can {{we explain}} the {{emergence}} and persistence of extremely uneven urban development? The concept of uneven development {{is most often}} used {{at the national level}} of analysis, but we argue that it not only has application, but serves to identify even more striking inequalities, at the local level. The community of South Lakes, formerly Tillicum, in Lakewood, Washington, is one of the poorest in the United States. It has endured decades of poverty and neglect. It is, however, within easy walking distance of the Lakewood community of Gravelly Lake which is a residential neighborhood where the median household income is above the 75 percentile for the United States as a whole. How can we make sense of this stark juxtaposition of affluence and need, deprivation and luxury? To unravel this puzzle, we draw on two bodies of sociological theory, Domhoff’s theory of local power elites, and Logan and Molotch’s theory of growth coalitions, to analyze the political economy of uneven development <b>in</b> Lakewood, <b>Washington.</b> <b>Our</b> data are drawn from the United States Census Bureau’s Decennial Census 2000 and 2010, and various years of the American Community Survey between 2005 and 2013, as well as Census Bureau data on local government finances.
