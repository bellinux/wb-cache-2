50|$|Spartan 201-04 is a Solar Physics Spacecraft {{designed}} to perform remote sensing {{of the hot}} outer layers of the sun's atmosphere or corona. It {{is expected to be}} deployed on orbit 18 and retrieved on orbit 52. The objective of the observations are to investigate the mechanisms causing the heating of the solar corona and the acceleration of the solar wind which originates in the corona. Two primary experiments are the Ultraviolet Coronal Spectrometer from the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, and the White Light Coronograph (WLC) from the High Altitude Observatory. Spartan 201 has three secondary experiments. The Technology Experiment Augmenting Spartan (TEXAS) is a Radio Frequency (RF) communications experiment which provided flight experience for components baselined on future Spartan missions, and a real time communications and control link with the primary Spartan 201 experiments. This link was used to provide a fine pointing adjustment to the WLC based on solar images downlinked real time. The Video Guidance Sensor (VGS) Flight Experiment is a laser guidance system which tested a key component of the Automated Rendezvous and Capture (AR&C) system. The Spartan Auxiliary Mounting Plate (SPAM) is a small <b>equipment</b> <b>mounting</b> plate which provided a mounting location for small experiments or auxiliary equipment of the Spartan Flight Support Structure (SFSS) It is a honeycomb plate using an experimental Silicon Carbide Aluminum face sheet material with an aluminum core.|$|E
5000|$|When {{planning}} a photograph in the field, as if stalking his subject enacting Philip Hyde's motivation that [...] "somewhere {{in this picture}} there's a photograph", McSavaney preferred to first inspect it from different locations and angles. It took him a while to make his photographs. At such times, no doubt an Adams' admonition was not far from his mind: [...] "a very small change in camera position can make a great difference in the visual relationships within the photograph". Peering at his subject through a cardboard cutout, rotating and extending it to frame the scene, his ‘viewing frame’, with dimensions proportional to the classic 4x5 film, enabled McSavaney to select the best vantage point. By holding it at different viewing distances, it further allowed him to select the appropriate lens. Parenthetically, he somewhat emulated Adams in use of the viewing frame {{as an aid to}} composition. [...] Having decided on the most advantageous location, he dropped the frame and retrieved his <b>equipment.</b> <b>Mounting</b> the selected view camera lens, and submerging under his darkcloth, he adjusted the camera. Then, anticipating the decisive moment, if one existed in that context, he exposed his negatives. Concerned about altering the natural tonalities of a subject, he rarely used lens filters, with their concomitant irreversible effects on a negative. He would take care of any tonal dissonances later in the darkroom.|$|E
5000|$|The SZD-41A Jantar Standard {{was built}} {{primarily}} of Fibreglass-Epoxy resin composite with local strengthening from welded steel tube in the fuselage centre-section, foam ribs {{in the wings}} and plywood at <b>equipment</b> <b>mounting</b> points. The skin was composed of fibreglass laminates laid up in moulds to attain accurate profiles. The monowheel manually retractable landing gear hung from the steel tube centre section structure which also mounted the towing hook and wing attachments. Large plate style airbrakes aft of the mainspar extend from {{the top and bottom}} surfaces, with the gaps sealed by spring-loaded covers when closed, also operating the disk brake on the monowheel at full extension. The cantilever fibreglass-epoxy tailplane is attached {{to the top of the}} fin, trimming of the elevator was achieved by spring loading the control stick and adjusting the neutral loading position. 80 litres (later 100) of water ballast could be carried in plastic tanks in the wings and jettisoned as required. The semi-reclining seat is in a comfortable cockpit enclosed by a two-part canopy, the front part fixed and the rear hinged to open rearwards for entry/exit. After modifications to remove restrictions on the prototypes and improvements required after flight testing, production of the SZD-41A and SZD-41B Jantar Standard commenced, continuing till 1978 when 159 had been built, many of which were exported worldwide. In common with many SZD products, the aircraft was delivered with a full range of basic instruments from Polish suppliers, which led to the famous punch-line: [...] "There I was, 50ft, inverted, nothing on the clock but the makers' name, and that was in (expletive redacted) Polish" [...] used in Gliding Club Bars throughout the world to humourise recovery from perilous situations.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. A near miss underwater explosion can significantly damage improperly shock hardened combat systems equipment and render the ship unable to 'fight hurt'. MIL-S- 901 D currently requires shock qualifying mediumweight equipment to a 'generic' shock excitation on the Navy's Mediumweight Shock Machine (MWSM). This shock excitation is severe, {{but not always}} characteristic of the actual ship structure response to an underwater explosion. This study proposes a design modification which will allow using a multi-DOF <b>equipment</b> <b>mounting</b> fixture on the MWSM which can be 'tuned' to simulate shipboard shock characteristics based on modal testing and previous ship shock trial data. Equipment qualified in this manner could be highly relied on to survive in battle. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|The {{equipment}} {{mounted on}} the carbody chassis of the railway vehicles is {{a critical component of}} the vehicle in terms of ride comfort. The reason for that is their large mass, able to visibly influence the vibrations mode of the carbody. The paper examines the influence of the equipment upon the mode of vertical vibrations of the carbody in the high-speed vehicles, reached {{on the basis of the}} frequency response functions of the acceleration in three carbody reference points - at the centre and above the bogies. These functions are derived from the numerical simulations developed on a rigid-flexible coupled model, with seven degrees of freedom. As a rule, the results herein prove the influence of the <b>equipment</b> <b>mounting</b> mode (rigid or elastic), along with the speed regime, upon the level of vibrations in the carbody reference points, at the resonance frequency of the symmetrical bending mode. Similarly, it is also demonstrated how the equipment mass and the damping degree of the suspension system affect the level of the vibrations in the carbody...|$|E
40|$|CIVINSThe {{stationary}} field {{synchronous motor}} (SFSM) {{has been described}} and analyzed previously. This machine usually consists of a stationary, direct current field winding and a rotating, alternating current armature winding. The field winding is superconducting. This topology presents certain advantages and disadvantages. One of the greatest theoretical advantages is reduced acoustic emission. The precise nature of such reductions has not been considered in previous work. We investigate the gross acoustic signature of a notional stationary field synchronous motor utilized as a marine propulsion motor in a naval combatant using the following methodology: (1) model the forces (harmonic by harmonic) of electromagnetic origin using solutions of the two dimensional Laplace Equation arising from the scalar potential of a magnetic field, (2) Develop a force spectrum based upon this modeling, (3) Develop appropriate acoustic transfer functions describing the acoustic * propagation of the machine components, <b>equipment</b> <b>mounting</b> structures, and other pertinent items in the machine-to-sea sound conduction path, (4) Apply the force spectrum to the acoustic transfer function(s), and (5) obtain a meaningful far-field acoustic signature due to the SFSM.

40|$|The {{explosive}} shock {{created by}} the underwater explosion of a mine or torpedo {{in close proximity to}} a surface ship can severely threaten the combat capability and survivability of the ship. MEL-S- 901 D specifics the shock test procedures and acceptance criteria for all shipboard systems that must resist high impact mechanical shock. While the U. S. Navy's Medium-weight Shock Machine with its standard <b>equipment</b> <b>mounting</b> fixture can subject a combat systems component to more severe shock excitations than experienced in actual ship shock trials, it cannot simulate the lower frequency excitations typically transmitted through a ship's superstructure during shock trials that expose equipment to catastrophic resonant vibration. This study is an experimental investigation into the dynamic response of the recently built Two Degree-of-Freedom (2 DOF) tuned Deck Simulator (TDS) for the Medium-weight Shock Machine (MWSM) to evaluate its potential role in the pre-acceptance shock qualification of new shipboard combat systems equipment. Upon completion of final characterization testing, the 2 DOF-TDS could be integrated into the medium-weight shock qualification procedures of MIL-S- 901 D. This improvement could significantly enhance the capacity of a warship to absorb damage and still maintain its mission integrity. NANAU. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|E
40|$|As small {{satellites}} 2 ̆ 7 power-to-external area ratios increase, so {{does the}} ordeal of securing the necessary thermal radiator area. To provide robust temperature control for any conceivable power density, two new concepts are proposed: a satellite architecture based on deployed equipment modules for increased radiator area, and thermal switches on each package mounted to module panels. A beneficial synergy comes from employing these independent concepts on small satellites whose exterior panels serve as both <b>equipment</b> <b>mounting</b> decks and thermal radiators. Hypothetical examples of multiple module deployments demonstrate the potential for dramatic increases in effective radiator area that allows a comfortably large hot-case margin. Cold-case temperature control comes from thermal switches that vary package-to-deck interface pressure {{as a function of}} package temperature to provide high interface resistance at low temperature. Two such switches based on the temperature dependent properties of shape memory alloy and paraffin are described. Positive and negative comparisons are made to conventional thermal design and deployed radiators. The efficient and effective temperature control subsystem described reduces the need for: auxiliary heaters to maintain minimum temperatures, rigorous thermal design and analysis, design verification testing, sophisticated thermo-optical surfaces, and active temperature control (in the conventional sense) for the entire satellite. This has been a feasibility of concept study with no development hardware or testing. Opinions on usefulness, future direction, and potential application are solicited...|$|E
40|$|Based {{upon the}} {{recommendations}} of the UH- 60 A Airloads Program Review Committee, work towards a NASTRAN remodeling effort has been conducted. This effort modeled and added the necessary structural/mass components to the existing UH- 60 A baseline NASTRAN model to reflect the addition of flight test components currently in place on the UH- 60 A Airloads Program Test Configuration used in NASA-Ames Research Center's Modern Technology Rotor Airloads Program. These components include necessary flight hardware such as instrument booms, movable ballast cart, <b>equipment</b> <b>mounting</b> racks, etc. Recent modeling revisions have also been included in the analyses to reflect the inclusion of new and updated primary and secondary structural components (i. e., tail rotor shaft service cover, tail rotor pylon) and improvements to the existing finite element mesh (i. e., revisions of material property estimates). Mode frequency and shape results have shown that components such as the Trimmable Ballast System baseplate and its respective payload ballast have caused a significant frequency change in a limited number of modes while only small percent changes in mode frequency are brought about with the addition of the other MTRAP flight components. With the addition of the MTRAP flight components, update of the primary and secondary structural model, and imposition of the final MTRAP weight distribution, modal results are computed representative of the 'best' model presently available...|$|E
