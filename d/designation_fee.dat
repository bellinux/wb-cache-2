50|$|The {{application}} fee {{is composed of}} three types of fees: a basic fee, a publication fee, and a <b>designation</b> <b>fee</b> for each designated Contracting Party.|$|E
50|$|A European patent {{may only}} be granted jointly in respect of Switzerland and Liechtenstein, {{following}} a joint designation under Article 149 EPC. Upon filing a European patent application, an applicant cannot choose to designate Switzerland without designating Liechtenstein, or Liechtenstein without designating Switzerland. The designation {{of one of the}} two countries is deemed to be a designation of both. This also meant, for European patent applications filed before 1 April 2009 (before the introduction of an all-inclusive <b>designation</b> <b>fee</b> payable for all EPC contracting states), that a single joint <b>designation</b> <b>fee</b> was payable for Switzerland and Liechtenstein.|$|E
50|$|All the Contracting States {{party to}} the EPC {{at the time of}} filing of a European patent {{application}} are deemed to be designated in the request for grant of a European patent, i.e. upon filing of the application. A flat <b>designation</b> <b>fee</b> must then be paid within six months of the date on which the European Patent Bulletin mentions the publication of the European search report.|$|E
50|$|In the European patent grant procedure, {{the mention}} of the {{publication}} of the European search report in the European Patent Bulletin marks the start of the six-month period for filing the request for examination, paying the examination <b>fee,</b> paying the <b>designation</b> <b>fees,</b> and paying the extension fees.|$|R
5000|$|During the {{prosecution}} phase, a European patent {{is a single}} regional proceeding, and [...] "the grant of a European patent may be requested for {{one or more of}} the Contracting States." [...] An applicant for a European patent designates those Contracting States in which protection for the invention is desired, [...] and the designations need to be [...] "confirmed" [...] later during the procedure through the payment of <b>designation</b> <b>fees.</b> Once granted by the EPO, a European patent comes into existence effectively as a group of national patents in each of the designated Contracting States.|$|R
30|$|The {{slaughterhouse}} is a {{quarantine area}} where {{three sets of}} butchers bring healthy livestock, livestock having difficulty in calving, livestock having injuries and livestock infested with livestock diseases to be slaughtered. Their motivation is purely profit-making through the sale of livestock products and by-products {{to a wide range}} of consumers. Livestock buyers are the first set of butchers, who frequent pastoral regions and purchase large consignments of live animals from pastoralists in livestock markets. They visit livestock markets such as Kimanjo, Rumuruti, Doldol and Naibor in Laikipia County among others, in the company of transporters. They represent business merchants whose sole drive is to profit from the sale of livestock products and by-products after processing at the slaughterhouse, selling to a wide customer base within and outside the county of Laikipia. The transporters are vehicle owners engaged in the ferrying of live animals to desired <b>designations</b> at a <b>fee</b> agreeable with the livestock buyers. In most cases, the desired designation for livestock buyers are slaughterhouses like Nanyuki slaughterhouse in Laikipia, Nyeri slaughterhouse in Nyeri and Huruma slaughterhouse in Nairobi Counties.|$|R
5000|$|Extensive {{changes were}} also {{made to the}} {{possibilities}} for the legal remedy of the failure to observe various time limits within the European patent system. Most particularly, the failure to pay various fees (filing fee, <b>designation</b> <b>fee,</b> search fee and examination fee) were, until the coming into force of the EPC 2000, excluded from the standard legal remedies of further processing [...] and re-establishment of rights. Under the EPC 1973, the failure to observe the time limits for paying these fees could only be remedied by strict grace periods. These grace periods have now {{been replaced by the}} application of further processing [...] and, if the further processing time limit is missed, re-establishment of rights, which although not directly applicable to the time limit missed originally, is applicable to the failure to observe the time limit for further processing.|$|E
