Additionally, SDB is associated with comorbidity and its subsequent polypharmacy, which may increase with increasing age. Finally, the increased prevalence of SDB is intrinsically linked to the obesity epidemic. SDB is associated with serious outcomes in younger people and, likewise, older people. Thus, identification, diagnosis and treatment of SDB is important irrelevant of age.

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review {{recently}} published studies on {{stress urinary incontinence}} surgery outcomes <b>in</b> <b>older</b> women. RECENT FINDINGS: Five prospective and two retrospective studies were identified that reported tension-free vaginal tape (n = 6), colposuspension (n = 1) and cadaveric fascia transvaginal sling (n = 1) procedure results. In each study, 21 - 175 older women were included, with mean ages ranging from 71 to 83 years; most studies included younger comparison groups. Mean follow-ups ranged from 3 to 30 months. Subjective stress urinary incontinence 2 ̆ 7 cure/improvement 2 ̆ 7 rates after surgery were significantly lower <b>in</b> <b>older</b> women when compared with younger women in only one study, although similar trends were seen in two additional studies. Intraoperative complications occurred at similar rates <b>in</b> <b>older</b> and younger women. Postoperative complications (urinary tract infection, urgency, voiding dysfunction, and mesh erosion) were more common <b>in</b> <b>older</b> women <b>in</b> only a few studies.

40|$|Posttraumatic stress {{disorder}} (PTSD) is a mental disorder {{that is known}} to have deleterious psychological, physical, and social impacts on individuals. Recognition of PTSD <b>in</b> <b>older</b> adults is difficult due to the complicated presentation taking into account that PTSD symptoms may be masked by other psychiatric and/or somatic diagnoses that are more common <b>in</b> <b>older</b> adults. Furthermore, some older adults may underreport their PTSD symptoms, and the relationship between current symptoms and distant traumas may be difficult to detect. Limited empirical research has been done on the manifestation, course, and treatment of PTSD <b>in</b> <b>older</b> adults. <b>In</b> this article, the literature on PTSD <b>in</b> <b>older</b> adults is reviewed, including discussion of common diagnostic problems, illustrated by a case report of an older woman with late-onset PTSD after a cerebral vascular accident (CVA). In conclusion, identifying PTSD <b>in</b> <b>older</b> adults can be difficult.

40|$|We {{aimed at}} {{reviewing}} age-related changes in kidney structure and function, methods for estimating kidney function, {{and impact of}} reduced kidney function on geriatric outcomes, {{as well as the}} reliability and applicability of equations for estimating glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <b>in</b> <b>older</b> patients. CKD is associated with different comorbidities and adverse outcomes such as disability and premature death <b>in</b> <b>older</b> populations.

Thus, an accurate and reliable method for calculating eGFR would be highly desirable for early detection and management of CKD in this vulnerable population.
