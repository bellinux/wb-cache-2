5|$|Entering the German 500, Gil de Ferran {{held the}} lead in the season's points standings with 115 points. Bräck and Hélio Castroneves were joint second on 110 points, and Michael Andretti was fourth, seven points <b>further</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E
5|$|The race {{took place}} in the {{afternoon}} from 14:00 CEST (UTC+2), in dry and sunny weather. At the start of the race, J.J. Lehto stalled his Benetton on the grid. Pedro Lamy, starting from <b>further</b> <b>back</b> on the grid, had his view of the stationary Benetton blocked by other cars and hit the back of Lehto's car, causing bodywork and tyres to fly into the air. Parts of the car went over the safety fencing designed to protect spectators at the startline causing minor injuries to nine people. <b>Further</b> <b>back,</b> Martin Brundle had a good start, overtaking two cars as well as Lehto, propelling him from thirteenth to tenth place.|$|E
5|$|With his victory, Bräck {{claimed the}} lead in the points competition; with five races left in the season, he had 131 points. De Ferran was in second, 11 points behind Bräck, and Andretti was five points <b>further</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E

Like the BT46B, the BT46C removed the radiators from the front wing assembly leaving a clean aerodynamic wing and moving the centre of gravity <b>further</b> <b>back</b> again. The standard radiators were replaced by units from a Volkswagen Golf mounted behind the front wheels out of the airstream in a region of positive pressure.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the race, Nico Rosberg secured second place in the Drivers' Championship ahead of Vettel. <b>Further</b> <b>back,</b> Kimi Räikkönen closed the gap to fourth placed Valtteri Bottas to just one point ahead of the final race of the season.

5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is {{relatively}} long and line-shaped. The central groove in the nasal depression {{is relatively}} narrow. The frontal bones are slightly rounded and bear a prominent sagittal crest. <b>Further</b> <b>back</b> on the braincase, the lambdoid crest is also prominent. The middle {{part of the}} palate is concave, not flat as in M.aelleni and M.manavi. At the palate's back margin is a long, thin posterior palatal spine.|$|E

5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is rounded. The central groove in {{the nasal}} {{depression}} is relatively narrow. The frontal bones are inflated and bear a prominent sagittal crest. <b>Further</b> <b>back</b> on the braincase, the lambdoid crest is poorly developed. The middle {{part of the}} palate is flat, not concave as in M.brachytragos, M.griveaudi, and M.mahafaliensis. At the palate's back margin is a short, thick posterior palatal spine.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Hamilton {{entered the}} race as the {{defending}} {{winner of the}} Grand Prix and Drivers' Championship leader with a 41-point lead over his Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel came into the event eight points <b>further</b> <b>back</b> in third. Mercedes led the Constructors' Championship over Ferrari by 153 points, with Williams a further 110 points behind Ferrari.|$|E
5|$|The cranial {{features}} Ocepeia {{shares with}} primitive eutherians include eye-sockets (orbits) set <b>further</b> <b>back</b> on the skull, relatively narrow cheek bones (zygomatic arches), and {{details of the}} inner ear, while characters it shares with paenungulates their paenungulate-like ancestors include a wide nasal cavity and a very short bony projection in the eye-socket. Pneumatized skulls are also found in larger proboscideans (e.g. elephants, mastodons, and other extinct relatives).|$|E

5|$|At the back, the nasals are {{separated}} by the frontal in K. langenbergensis, the back third of which is somewhat vaulted. The portion of the frontal between the eyes is one-third {{the width of the}} entire skull in both species, but it widens <b>further</b> <b>back</b> to form the front of the skull roof. The prefrontal is straight along its contact with the frontal and nasal (about half of the bone is in contact with each), but forms an angle between the margin of the eye socket and the lacrimal on the other side. This angle is rounded in K. guimarotae such that the bone is oval-shaped, but very pointed in K. langenbergensis such that the bone is triangular.|$|E
5|$|Carlos Sainz {{was cleared}} to race albeit not setting {{a time in}} qualifying, being allowed to start {{from the back of}} the grid. At the start, Nico Rosberg led away from Lewis Hamilton, while <b>further</b> <b>back,</b> Nico Hülkenberg spun into turn two, tagging Max Verstappen and Marcus Ericsson. Verstappen had a {{puncture}} while Hülkenberg and Ericsson retired on the spot, causing the safety car to be deployed. Meanwhile, Räikkönen and Kvyat experienced good starts, gaining two and four places respectively. Racing resumed on the end of lap 3, with Rosberg retaining his race lead. However, <b>further</b> <b>back</b> Bottas overtook Räikkönen to take third. By lap 7, Sainz had moved up into 14th place, while Felipe Massa was up into ninth place from 15th on the grid. Race leader Nico Rosberg needed to retire at the end of the seventh lap due to a locked throttle, handing the race lead to championship leader Lewis Hamilton. On lap 10, Pastor Maldonado moved ahead of Jenson Button to take tenth, while Hamilton was extending his lead over second placed Bottas. A second safety car phase occurred on lap 12, when Romain Grosjean lost the back of his Lotus in turn 3 and crashed into the barriers. While Grosjean escaped uninjured, his car was heavily damaged. With a lot of debris on track, the safety car stayed out until lap 17. At the restart, Vettel attacked teammate Räikkönen for third. While the Finn was able to stay ahead by going wide into turn 2, he subsequently gave up the place to Vettel. One lap later, Ricciardo and Sainz fought for tenth place, with Daniel Ricciardo coming out on top and retaining the position.|$|E
5|$|Deciding {{to speak}} with Janos, Raziel orders Moebius to send him <b>further</b> <b>back</b> in time. Moebius deceives Raziel, instead {{conveying}} him over a century into the future, where he and The Elder God highlight {{the consequences of the}} Pillars' destruction to turn Raziel against Kain. Raziel navigates the future era and finds his own way back to the age of the Sarafan and Janos Audron. There, Janos presents Raziel with the Reaver, a younger version of the physical Soul Reaver blade which will later house a soul-devouring spirit. Suddenly, a group of Sarafan led by Raziel's former, human self launch an ambush, and Janos sacrifices himself. Raziel swears vengeance as Janos dies, and pursues the attackers. He uses the Reaver to kill them and his younger self, renouncing his Sarafan past.|$|E

50|$|In 1899, <b>further</b> <b>backing</b> was {{obtained}} and South Crofty gradually reopened, and acquired the adjacent New Cooks Kitchen mine. Improvements {{were made in}} the mine and the deepening of Robinsons Shaft commenced in 1903. The mine returned to profit and in 1906 a new era began, with the incorporation of South Crofty Limited.|$|R
5|$|Flight 77 was {{scheduled}} to depart for Los Angeles at 08:10; 58 passengers boarded through Gate D26, including the five hijackers. Excluding the hijackers, of the 59 other passengers and crew on board, there were 26 men, 22 women, and five children {{ranging in age from}} three to eleven. On the flight, Hani Hanjour was seated up front in 1B, while Salem and Nawaf al-Hazmi were seated in first class in seats 5E and 5F. Majed Moqed and Khalid al-Mihdhar were seated <b>further</b> <b>back</b> in 12A and 12B, in economy class. Flight 77 left the gate on time and took off from Runway 30 at Dulles at 08:20.|$|E
5|$|<b>Further</b> <b>back</b> in the field, Max Verstappen overtook Nasr and Button to {{move into}} twelfth place on laps 44 and 46 respectively. However, he was deemed to have forced Button wide and was handed a five-second penalty {{to be added to}} his {{finishing}} time. Lap 53 saw Romain Grosjean move into the final point scoring position of tenth by passing Carlos Sainz Jr. into turn eight. Just one lap later, he took ninth place from Daniil Kvyat. At the front, Hamilton proved unable to reach his teammate, who took the checkered flag for his sixth win of the season. Kimi Räikkönen completed the podium, followed by Vettel, Pérez and Ricciardo.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) {{is large}} and robust. The nasal bones are short, not {{extending}} <b>further</b> <b>back</b> than the lacrimals, and the premaxillaries extend about {{as far back as}} the nasals. The zygomatic plate is narrow and lacks a zygomatic notch, an extension of the plate at the front. The plate's back margin is level with the front of the first upper molar. The narrowest part of the interorbital region, located between the eyes, is to the front and its margins exhibit strong beading. Various crests develop on the long braincase, especially in old animals. The parietal bones form part of the roof of the braincase and, unlike in some other rice rats, also extend to the sides of the braincase.|$|E

50|$|In 1928 Hillman {{fell under}} the control of the Rootes {{brothers}} and then merged with Humber. The Rootes brothers obtained <b>further</b> <b>backing</b> from Prudential Assurance during 1931 and brought their holding up to 60 per cent of Humber. Then, in stages, Hillman was switched to manufacturing small cars and became the best known brand within the Rootes empire alongside Humber, Sunbeam and, in the Rootes Group's final decade, Singer.|$|R
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is rounded. The central groove in {{the nasal}} {{depression}} (the lowered {{area at the}} nose) is relatively broad in comparison to M.manavi. The frontal bones (part of the skull roof) bear a well-developed sagittal crest (a crest that provides support for muscles of the head). <b>Further</b> <b>back</b> on the braincase, the lambdoid crest (another such crest) is also prominent. The middle part of the palate is concave, as in M.brachytragos and M.mahafaliensis, but unlike in M.aelleni and M.manavi, which have a flat palate. At the palate's back margin is a long, robust posterior palatal spine.|$|E
5|$|Like Equijubus, Probactrosaurus, Gongpoquansaurus, {{and other}} styracosternans, Eolambia has {{cervical}} vertebrae {{which are very}} opisthocoelous, meaning that their front ends are strongly convex while their back ends are strongly concave. Unusually, {{the front end of}} the third cervical is set slightly higher than the back end, which is not seen in any other cervical vertebrae. Vertebrae from <b>further</b> <b>back</b> in the neck have a greater angle between the elongate articular processes known as the postzygapophyses, and also more elongate transverse processes. On the transverse processes, there are further articular processes – the rounded parapophyses and rod-like diapophyses – are located. In the rearmost cervicals, there is also a deep depression separating the postzygapophyses, and the neural spines have steeply-angled front margins, which has the effect of creating prominent spike-like projections.|$|E
5|$|Microgale macpheei {{is known}} from two specimens: a damaged cranium (skull without mandibles, or lower jaws) lacking the back part (the parietal bones and <b>further</b> <b>back)</b> {{as well as}} the incisors, canines, and second premolars; and another damaged cranium lacking the same parts {{as well as the}} left toothrow. Both show no {{evidence}} of ongoing tooth replacement, indicating that the permanent dentition is complete. M.macpheei was larger in most measurements than M.brevicaudata, but because of small samples, some differences are not statistically significant. The length of the bony palate in the two specimens of M.macpheei is 9.4 and 9.7mm, compared to 7.1 to 9.0mm in eight adult M.brevicaudata. In both specimens, the length of the molar row is 3.0mm, compared to 2.4 to 2.8mm in the sample of M.brevicaudata.|$|E
25|$|The Detroit Automobile Company was reorganized {{into the}} Henry Ford Company on November 20, 1901, after Ford gained <b>further</b> <b>backing</b> from investors {{because of his}} racing success.
