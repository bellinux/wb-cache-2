5|$|The League Cup {{was clearly}} not one of Ferguson's main {{priorities}} of the season, as he used it to blood the younger and less-known players. After being swept aside {{in the third round}} by Ipswich Town – a team {{at the bottom of the}} First Division – Ferguson came under <b>intense</b> <b>scrutiny</b> for fielding a reshuffled squad. However, the manager felt that it was, at the time, an unwanted domestic distraction.|$|E
5|$|Many other botanists echoed Lindley's earlier {{concerns}} about the phylogeny of the Liliaceae, but various schemes to divide the family gained little traction. Dahlgren (1985) suggested there were in fact forty – not one – families distributed over three orders (predominantly Liliales and Asparagales). In {{the context of a}} general review of the classification of angiosperms, the Liliaceae were subjected to more <b>intense</b> <b>scrutiny.</b> Considerable progress in plant phylogeny and phylogenetic theory enabled a phylogenetic tree to be constructed for all of the flowering plants, as elaborated by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (1998).|$|E
5|$|The {{disappearance}} attracted sustained {{international interest}} and saturation {{coverage in the}} UK reminiscent {{of the death of}} Diana in 1997. The McCanns were subjected to <b>intense</b> <b>scrutiny</b> and baseless allegations of involvement in their daughter's death, particularly in the tabloid press and on Twitter. In 2008 they received damages and front-page apologies from Express Newspapers, and in 2011 they testified before the Leveson Inquiry into British press misconduct, lending support to those arguing for tighter press regulation.|$|E

50|$|Banks-Blaney had a {{previous}} relationship with Gregory Barker, the UK Climate Change Minister. In October 2006 {{it was announced}} Barker had left his wife for Banks-Blaney amid <b>intense</b> media <b>scrutiny</b> upon them both.|$|R
5|$|Although Morgan {{was briefly}} {{seen as a}} hero, {{widespread}} fears concerning plutocracy and concentrated wealth soon eroded this view. Morgan's bank had survived, but the trust companies that were a growing rival to traditional banks were badly damaged. Some analysts believed that the panic had been engineered to damage confidence in trust companies so that banks would benefit. Others believed Morgan {{took advantage of the}} panic to allow his U.S. Steel company to acquire TC Although Morgan lost $21 million in the panic, and the significance of the role he played in staving off worse disaster is undisputed, he also became the focus of <b>intense</b> <b>scrutiny</b> and criticism.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea's {{emergence}} as title challengers {{put an end}} to Arsenal and Manchester United's domestic duopoly. The London club won back-to-back league titles in 2004–05 and 2005–06 under José Mourinho, at a time when Arsenal and United underwent a period of transition. Vieira and Keane had left their respective clubs by the end of 2005, while Ferguson came under <b>intense</b> <b>scrutiny</b> over his management. Nevertheless, he guided his team to Premier League success in 2006–07, and won a further four league titles. At Arsenal, Wenger oversaw the club's relocation to the Emirates Stadium and made the decision to prioritise it over strengthening the squad. The club sold several experienced players, replenishing them with younger talent. The 2005 Cup win was their last piece of silverware until 2014.|$|E
5|$|According The New York Times, the {{eavesdropping}} operations did {{not only}} target local criminals, {{but also the}} communications of top Chinese leaders, {{including those of the}} General Secretary, President Hu Jintao. One source connected to the Chinese leadership said that Bo tried to monitor nearly all central leaders who had visited Chongqing in order to better understand what they thought of him. In August 2011, a phone call between Hu Jintao and anti-corruption official Ma Wen was found to be wiretapped under Bo's orders. The revelations about the eavesdropping operation resulted in <b>intense</b> <b>scrutiny</b> from the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. It was also said to have sowed distrust and {{played a role in the}} falling out of Bo and his police chief Wang Lijun, who allegedly began to use the same eavesdropping methods against Bo himself. The operations were believed to have contributed to Bo's downfall in 2012.|$|E
500|$|Since {{the crisis}} began, many of Iceland's {{business}} leaders, {{who had previously}} been considered financial gurus who greatly developed Iceland's economy, are now under <b>intense</b> public <b>scrutiny</b> for their roles in causing the financial crisis: ...|$|R

50|$|On January 19, 2008, {{following}} <b>intense</b> public <b>scrutiny,</b> Maynard disqualified {{himself from}} the Massey appeal. The acting chief justice appointed Circuit Judge Don Cookman {{to sit on the}} court for Caperton's rehearing petition. On January 23, 2008, the Court voted 5-0 to rehear Caperton's appeal.|$|R
25|$|In {{the years}} after the LDS Church began {{practicing}} polygamy, it drew <b>intense</b> <b>scrutiny</b> and criticism from the United States government. This criticism led to the Utah Mormon War, and eventually the abandonment of the practice {{under the leadership of}} Wilford Woodruff, who issued the 1890 Manifesto.|$|E
25|$|In May 2014, after 15 {{years of}} {{restrictions}} and <b>intense</b> <b>scrutiny,</b> the United States Department of State reclassified satellites and several related components {{so they will}} no longer be treated as munitions whose export is controlled by ITAR, but will be covered instead under the Export Administration Regulations. These new classifications took effect in November, 2014, six months after the announcement of the reclassification.|$|E
25|$|Tismăneanu's {{background}} and work came under <b>intense</b> <b>scrutiny</b> after his 2006 appointment by Romanian President Traian Băsescu {{as head of}} the Presidential Commission for the Study of the Communist Dictatorship in Romania, which presented its report to the Romanian Parliament on December 18, 2006. There has been much controversy about the choice of Tismăneanu as commission president, about Tismăneanu's choices for commission members, and about the conclusions of the report.|$|E
50|$|In 2013, when Mayor of Toronto Rob Ford {{was under}} <b>intense</b> police <b>scrutiny,</b> his brother, then Toronto City Councillor Doug Ford called for Pringle's {{resignation}} alleging {{that he was}} in a conflict of interest as he went on a fishing trip with Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair.|$|R

5000|$|Throughout his {{editorial}} {{and advertising}} career, Raymond {{has engaged in}} an independent photographic practice. His un-commissioned work stems from curiosity about the multi-faceted capacities of photography - from ambitious surveys of historic landmarks, and <b>intense</b> studio-based <b>scrutiny</b> of visual forms, to acute and simple photographic observation {{of the world around}} him.|$|R
25|$|Also in 1974, the Reg Grundy Organisation created {{its first}} soap opera, and {{significantly}} Australia's first teen soap opera, Class of '74. With {{its attempts to}} hint at the sex and sin shown more openly on Number 96 and The Box, its high school setting and early evening timeslot, Class of '74 came under <b>intense</b> <b>scrutiny</b> from the Broadcasting Control Board, who vetted scripts and altered entire storylines.|$|E
25|$|Four {{years later}} Mountbatten secured an {{invitation}} for himself and Amanda to accompany Charles on his planned 1980 tour of India. Their fathers promptly objected. Prince Philip thought that the Indian public's reception would more likely reflect response to the uncle than to the nephew. Lord Brabourne counselled that the <b>intense</b> <b>scrutiny</b> of the press {{would be more likely}} to drive Mountbatten's godson and granddaughter apart than together.|$|E
25|$|During {{a one-day}} {{international}} between Australia and Pakistan in January 2010, Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi {{was captured by}} television cameras making two solid biting motions into the ball; he was suspended for two matches after pleading guilty to ball tampering. In the same game, Pakistan player Khalid Latif was crash-tackled to the ground by a spectator who had run onto the ground to reach the cricketer, later leading to <b>intense</b> <b>scrutiny</b> of the WACA's security measures.|$|E
50|$|Although Leyla {{was never}} {{formally}} charged, {{she became a}} subject of <b>intense</b> media <b>scrutiny</b> because of her aboriginal ethnicity and her social circumstances. She and her family, including Erika, moved away from Edmonton to avoid the media attention, though she accepted interview requests on the one-year and ten-year anniversaries of the event.|$|R
50|$|In early 2009 when politicians' expense claims {{came under}} <b>intense</b> public <b>scrutiny,</b> Bill Butler's attempt to claim back a £1 charity {{donation}} that a hotel made on his behalf, saying the hotel made the charge without his knowledge, was cited as an egregious example. His claim {{was rejected by}} the Scottish Parliament authorities.|$|R
5000|$|Despite the {{internal}} differences within the party, however, the Coalition steadily {{rose in the}} polls. As the election drew closer, some polls showed the Coalition passing the critical five percent threshold. As the result, the party came under <b>intense</b> media <b>scrutiny</b> and was criticized by its opponents. Rather than assisting the party, however, the increased media coverage appeared to damage its chances, with many people expressing worry about the more extreme elements of the party. The Coalition claimed that the media coverage about it was biased, saying that the news media set out to [...] "falsely" [...] portray them as extremist. Opponents of the Coalition, however, said that the <b>intense</b> media <b>scrutiny</b> penetrated an artificial layer of reasonableness that the Coalition had adopted, revealing the party's allegedly true character. Whatever the case, the party's polling dropped below the five percent threshold once again.|$|R
25|$|After {{the release}} of The Skeptical Environmentalist in 2001, Lomborg was {{subjected}} to <b>intense</b> <b>scrutiny</b> and criticism in the media, where his scientific qualifications and integrity were both attacked and defended. The verdict of the Danish Committees for Scientific Dishonesty fueled this debate and brought it into the spotlight of international mass media. By the end of 2003 Lomborg had become an international celebrity, with frequent appearances on radio, television and print media around the world.|$|E
25|$|Possible {{challenges}} to this theory emerged recently, {{with the discovery}} of two nearby long gamma-ray bursts that lacked the signature of any type of supernova: both GRB060614 and GRB 060505 defied predictions that a supernova would emerge despite <b>intense</b> <b>scrutiny</b> from ground-based telescopes. Both events were, however, associated with actively star-forming stellar populations. One possible explanation is that during the core collapse of a very massive star a black hole can form, which then 'swallows' the entire star before the supernova blast can reach the surface.|$|E
25|$|Because the apparition, and the purportedly miraculous {{transposition}} of the Virgin's image onto Diego's tilma ("mantle") of ayatl, or maguey cloth, {{are largely}} {{credited with the}} conversion of the Native American Mexica (Aztecs) and other peoples of Mexico to Roman Catholicism, all documents pertaining to the alleged miracle {{have been the subject of}} the <b>intense</b> <b>scrutiny</b> of the Roman Catholic Church, the colonial Spanish Crown (and after 1820, the Mexican government), scholars of Latin American religion and history, scholars of classical Nahuatl, as well as independent Guadalupanos, skeptics, and historians the world over.|$|E
40|$|In November 2001 Journalism {{educators}} at the University of Technology, Sydney (UTS) facilitated a {{day long}} workshop on media skills {{for members of}} the United Muslim Women Association (UMWA) in Sydney.

50|$|<b>Intense</b> media <b>scrutiny</b> {{and public}} {{pressure}} mounted, demanding American response after {{the sinking of}} the Falaba, which was widely reported as nothing short of a massacre of innocent civilians without warning. A Note was prepared by President Wilson to Germany, though he knew that the implications would likely lead to a declaration of war.|$|R
25|$|Wadia dated Bollywood actress Preity Zinta from February 2005 until 2009, and {{the couple}} were subject to <b>intense</b> media <b>scrutiny.</b> On 13 June 2014, Zinta filed a {{complaint}} with the Mumbai police against Wadia alleging he had attacked her at an IPL match at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on 30 May. Wadia has denied the allegations.|$|R
25|$|Over the 1980s, in {{the context}} of a more general review of the {{classification}} of angiosperms, the Liliaceae were subjected to more <b>intense</b> <b>scrutiny.</b> By the end of that decade, the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, the British Museum of Natural History and the Edinburgh Botanical Gardens formed a committee to examine the possibility of separating the family at least for the organization of their herbaria. That committee finally recommended that 24 new families be created in the place of the original broad Liliaceae, largely by elevating subfamilies to the rank of separate families.|$|E
25|$|The amygdaloid complex {{helps us}} {{interpret}} emotional experience and act appropriately. This {{is conducive to}} directing the individual's attention to the most pertinent stimuli in a potentially dangerous situation so that the individual can take self-protective measures. Proper amygdaloid complex function requires input from the thalamus, which creates a thalamoamygdala pathway capable of bypassing the <b>intense</b> <b>scrutiny</b> of incoming stimuli to enable quick responses in a potentially life-threatening situation. Typically, situations assessed as non-threatening are disregarded. In sleep paralysis, however, those pathways can become over-excited and move {{into a state of}} hyper-vigilance in which the mind perceives every external stimulus as a threat.|$|E
25|$|Böhm-Bawerk's {{critique}} of Marx's theories was put under <b>intense</b> <b>scrutiny</b> by Marxian economists, such as Nikolai Bukharin. In his Economic Theory of the Leisure Class (1927), Bukharin argued that Böhm-Bawerk's axiomatic assumptions of individual freedom in his subjectivist theories are fallacious in that economic phenomena {{can only be}} understood under the prism of a coherent, contextualised, and historical analysis of society, such as Marx's. By contrast, Austrian economists have regarded Böhm-Bawerk's {{critique of}} Marx as definitive. For example, Gottfried Haberler argued Böhm-Bawerk's thorough critique of Marx's economics was so devastating that as of the 1960s no Marxian scholar had conclusively refuted it.|$|E
500|$|The England manager's job {{is subject}} to <b>intense</b> press <b>scrutiny,</b> often {{including}} revelations about the incumbent's private life.

Upon her marriage, Bessette-Kennedy's relationship {{with her husband and}} her fashion sense became the subject of <b>intense</b> media <b>scrutiny,</b> drawing comparisons to Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.|$|R
50|$|During high-publicity court cases, {{the media}} are often accused of {{provoking}} an atmosphere of public hysteria akin to a lynch mob which not only makes a fair trial nearly impossible but means that regardless of {{the result of the}} trial the accused {{will not be able to}} live the rest of their life without <b>intense</b> public <b>scrutiny.</b>|$|R
