40|$|Refrigeration {{systems in}} chilled rooms in 15 plants {{processing}} {{a variety of}} foods were studied. These included plants processing raw meat and salads, Chinese ready meals, dairy products, slicing and packing of cooked meats and catering establishments. An initial survey of total numbers of microbes at a total of 891 sites on evaporators, <b>drip</b> <b>trays</b> and chilled room walls was followed up with a more detailed examination of 336 sites with high counts, selecting for Listeria spp., coliforms, enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. Temperatures (particularly air on and air off, maximum and near defrost heaters) relative humidity, airflow, layout and cleaning regimes were surveyed. In general, no correlation could be found between any of the physical measurements and the numbers and types of bacteria detected. Maximum mean temperatures in the chilled rooms varied from - 1 to + 16. 9 °C and few chilled units were regularly cleaned. Twenty five percent of sites examined had more than 105 colony-forming units per cm 2, although, very few pathogens or faecal indicator bacteria were detected. Listeria spp. were not found and coliforms were found only once, in low numbers. Low numbers of S. aureus or B. cereus were present in 9 of the 15 plants, B. cereus was found on evaporators and associated <b>drip</b> <b>trays</b> in two catering plants and two plants processing cooked meat. Enterococci and S. aureus were found most frequently in a raw red meat slaughterhouse (always in low numbers). In general, microbial contamination was lower in rooms where wrapped rather than unwrapped products were stored. The type of product also affected the degree of contamination, with raw red meat and poultry or dry ingredients giving highest counts, and raw vegetables and cooked products lowest. The work demonstrated that bacteria were present on evaporator cooling coils in all factory cold rooms visited. Although evaporator-cleaning procedures were carried out in some factories as part of routine maintenance these were not shown to be effective at maintaining low levels of bacteria on evaporators. To maintain evaporator hygiene {{it is suggested that}} more regular cleaning procedures, possibly by means of automated cleansing systems, should be considered. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A four-hone {{system that}} pumps, filters, agitates, and carbon treats {{minimizes}} wastes generated from plating, printed circuit, and related operations. It eliminates costly leaks and spills associated with out-of-tank filter systems, enables {{application of a}} reusable filter media, reduces the frequency of waste-producing batch treatment operations, and extends solution life to minimize dumps. S' ignificant strides in waste minimization in the metal finishing " industty are often achieved using relatively simple, inexpensive measures. The use of counterflow and spray rinsing, conductivity controllers, extendeddrain time overtanks, moredilute (less polluting) baths, and <b>drip</b> <b>trays</b> are among these time-tested tools and techniques. More recently, an easy-to-use in-tank filter system with the four-in-one capability to pump, filter, agitate, and carbon treat ' has joined these uncomplicated, affordable technologies {{as a means of}} minimizing wastes. Its contributions include: 1 Eliminationof leaks and spills associatedwith outof-tank filter systems. H A reusable filter media to reduce the costs of filter consumption and disposal.

40|$|Water vending {{machines}} provide an alternative source of clean and {{safe drinking water}} to the consumers. However, the quality of drinking water may alter due to contamination from lack of hygienic practices and maintenance of the machines. Hence, {{this study was conducted}} to determine the microbiological quality of water from {{vending machines}} and associated contact surfaces. Seventeen water samples and 85 swab samples (nozzles, <b>drip</b> <b>trays,</b> coin slots, buttons and doors) from 3 locations in Kelantan were collected. Polymerase chain reaction amplification and 16 S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) sequencing were carried out and sequences obtained were compared against the sequences available in the National Centre for Biotechnology Information database using the basic local alignment search tool programme. Coliform counts were observed in 94. 12 % of water samples, 76. 47 % of nozzles and 82. 35 % of drip tray swabs. Furthermore, results of 16 S rRNA sequence analysis indicated that two gram-negative isolates were identified as Escherichia coli U 5 / 41 (Accession no. NR_ 024570. 1) and E. coli O 157 :H 7 EDL 933 (Accession no. CP 008957. 1) with similarity value of 100 %, respectively. The results from this study further improve our understanding of the potential microorganisms in drinking water. Regular maintenance and cleaning of water vending machines are important to reduce bacterial growth and the presence of waterborne pathogens...|$|E

5000|$|The {{product has}} a {{clamshell}} design which simultaneously heats {{the top and}} bottom surfaces of the food, eliminating the need to flip it. Each heating surface is grooved to reduce contact area, and covered in a non-stick coating. The lower heating surface is angled to allow melted fat and other fluids to drain through the grooves into a removable <b>drip</b> <b>tray,</b> which clearly shows the amount removed from the food. This arrangement has been marketed as a way to [...] "knock out the fat", suggesting a healthier way to cook.|$|R

50|$|Depending {{upon the}} {{selected}} chilled water temperatures {{and the relative}} humidity of the space, {{it is likely that}} the cooling coil will dehumidify the entering air stream, and as a by product of this process, it will at times produce a condensate which will need to be carried to drain. The fan coil unit will contain a purpose designed <b>drip</b> <b>tray</b> with drain connection for this purpose. The simplest means to drain the condensate from multiple fan coil units will be by a network of pipework laid to falls to a suitable point. Alternatively a condensate pump may be employed where space for such gravity pipework is limited.|$|R

50|$|Indirect {{grilling}} is {{a barbecue}} cooking technique {{in which the}} food is placed {{to the side of}} or above the heat source instead of directly over the flame as is more common. This can be achieved by igniting only some burners on a gas barbecue or by piling coals to one side of a charcoal pit. A <b>drip</b> <b>tray</b> is placed below the food to prevent fat from the food igniting and generating a direct flame. Indirect grilling is designed to cook larger (e.g. pork shoulders, whole chicken) or tougher foods (e.g. brisket, ribs) that would burn if cooked using a direct flame. This method of cooking generates a more moderate temperature (about 275-350 °F) and allows for an easier introduction of wood smoke for flavoring.|$|R
5000|$|The Oil Storage Regulations (2001) {{apply to}} oil tanks used for {{commercial}} and industrial purposes, or domestic tanks over 3500 litres in capacity. They state that the storage tank should be of [...] "sufficient strength and structural integrity {{to ensure that it}} is unlikely to burst or leak in its ordinary use". The tank, along with any filters, gauges, valves or ancillary equipment, must be contained within a secondary unit or bund which has at least 110% of the capacity of the inner tank. If the tank has a fill pipe that is not contained within the secondary unit, a <b>drip</b> <b>tray</b> must be installed. They also require the use of an automatic overfill prevention if it is not [...] "reasonably practical" [...] to monitor the oil levels within the tank.|$|R
40|$|An air fryer is {{a kitchen}} {{appliance}} that works by using high speed hot air circulation. When the fryer is working, {{it begins to}} produce hot air and a mechanical fan begins to circulate it very fast around the food, which fries the food and produces a crispy layer. Most hot air fryers come with adjustable temperature and timer knobs that allow for more precise cooking. Food is cooked in the cooking basket that sits on a <b>drip</b> <b>tray.</b> There are various brands of air fryers that claim to fry the food with 80 % less oil in general. Air fryer technology is based on "Rapid air technology " that uses the hot air to fry and cook the food which causes the use of less oil frying food. Which food needs what amount of cooking time. Time is a business {{which has not been}} dealt with properly. In most of the cases the user is compelled with a restricted amount of control. Most of the people wouldn’t have noticed (but can reason out very well) different type of food need different amount of cooking time which depends directly on the air temperature and fan speed etc...|$|R
