5|$|His {{relationship}} with Warrick Brown had {{aspects of a}} mentor/student bond, but {{out of all the}} CSIs (Catherine included), Grissom seemed to view Warrick as his successor, the one who would lead when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone.</b> Grissom found Warrick after he was shot by McKeen and held Warrick as he died in his arms.|$|E
5|$|According to an unquoted {{source in}} The Outlaw Bible of American Literature, on June 3, 1968, at 9:00am, Solanas {{arrived at the}} Chelsea Hotel, where Girodias lived. She asked {{for him at the}} desk but was told <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> for the weekend. She {{remained}} for three hours before heading to the Grove Press, where she asked for Barney Rosset, who was also not available.|$|E

60|$|O, {{look what}} has come from his mouth! O, look {{what has come}} from his mouth--the white {{butterfly}}! <b>He</b> <b>is</b> dead, and I have taken his soul in my hands; but I know why you open the lid of that golden box. I must give it to you. There then, (he puts butterfly in casket) he has gone through his pains, and you will open the lid in the Garden of Paradise.

5|$|At {{approximately}} 8:13pm, the aircraft's {{tail section}} sustained a sudden upward movement, significant enough to require trimming {{to bring the}} plane back to level flight. At approximately 10:15pm, Scott and Rataczak landed the 727, with the aft airstair still deployed, at Reno Airport. FBI agents, state troopers, sheriff's deputies, and Reno police surrounded the jet, as it {{had not yet been}} determined with certainty that Cooper was no longer aboard; but an armed search quickly confirmed that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone.</b>|$|E
5|$|Though Stanley and Black won the election, {{they never}} became {{political}} allies. At {{the time of}} their election and service, the Kentucky Constitution prescribed that the lieutenant governor would act as governor any time the governor left the state. Consequently, Stanley refused to travel out of state on vacation because he feared he would not approve of anyone Black would appoint to any unfilled governmental offices while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lafayette {{continued}} to work for order in the coming months. On 28 February 1791, Lafayette {{and part of the}} National Guard left the Tuileries to handle a conflict in Vincennes. While <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone,</b> hundred of armed nobles arrived at the Tuileries to defend the king; however, there were rumors that these nobles had come to take the king away and place him {{at the head of a}} counter-revolution. Lafayette quickly returned to the Tuileries and disarmed the nobles after a brief standoff. The event, later called the Day of Daggers, boosted Lafayette's popularity with the French people for his quick actions to protect the king.|$|E

5|$|Las Casas {{worked there}} in adverse {{conditions}} for the following months, being constantly harassed by the Spanish pearl fishers of Cubagua island who traded slaves for alcohol with the natives. Early in 1522 Las Casas left the settlement to complain to the authorities. While <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> the native Caribs attacked the settlement of Cumaná, burned {{it to the ground}} and killed four of Las Casas's men. He returned to Hispaniola in January 1522, and heard the news of the massacre. The rumours even included him among the dead. To make matters worse, his detractors used the event as evidence of the need to pacify the Indians using military means. The tragic outcome of Las Casas's great mainland adventure made him turn his life in a new direction.|$|E
5|$|Pedro Moreno, {{sent from}} the Audiencia of Santo Domingo in Hispaniola, arrived in Honduras {{shortly after the}} {{founding}} of Trujillo. He found forty colonists in a desperate state, lacking weapons and provisions. A few more Spaniards were still at Nito, the remnants of González Dávila's men, where their plight was even worse. The residents of Trujillo pleaded with Moreno for assistance, which he granted on condition that they renounced Cortés, accepted {{the jurisdiction of the}} Audiencia of Santo Domingo, and agreed to take Juan Ruano, one of Olid's former officers, as Chief Magistrate. Moreno renamed Trujillo as Ascensión, and he sent messages to Hernández de Córdoba, who was in Nicaragua, asking him to renounce his loyalty to Pedrarias and pledge allegiance to Santo Domingo. Moreno then returned to Hispaniola, promising to send aid. As soon as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone,</b> the residents restored the name of Trujillo, pledged their allegiance once more to Cortés, and expelled Juan Ruano.|$|E
25|$|In June 2008, Falsone just escaped his arrest. Police raided a {{house in}} Palazzo Adriano, in the {{province}} of Palermo, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> already. In March 2010, police seized more assets from Falsone worth €30 million.|$|E

25|$|An {{attack by}} the Japanese was repulsed, but the other Marine's weapon jammed and he {{returned}} to the command post to obtain another. While <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone,</b> the enemy managed to get a grenade in the foxhole, which exploded, blowing off Sgt Harrell's left hand.|$|E
25|$|In The Fellowship of the Ring, Radagast was unwittingly used by Saruman to lure Gandalf to his {{tower of}} Orthanc, where Gandalf was captured. Fortuitously, Radagast also helped rescue him by sending Gwaihir the Eagle to Orthanc {{with news of}} the {{movements}} of Sauron's forces. When Gwaihir saw that Gandalf was imprisoned {{on the top of}} the tower he carried him off to safety before Saruman realized <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone.</b>|$|E
25|$|Thanks to the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 her son {{was given}} the Kingdom of Sicily in {{recognition}} for his services to Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor in the War of the Spanish Succession.

Victor Amadeus II asked his mother to maintain the government while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone,</b> but she declined and her grandson Victor Amadeus, Prince of Piedmont was made regent instead.|$|E

25|$|In 1816, Jonathan Jennings {{was elected}} as Governor of Indiana, {{and he had}} {{convinced}} Harrison to run as his Lieutenant Governor. Harrison won the election defeating John Vawter and becoming Lieutenant Governor of Indiana. In 1817, Harrison {{became one of the}} founding members of the Grand Lodge of Indiana. In 1818, Jennings left the capitol to conduct negotiations on behalf of the federal government with the native tribes in northern Indiana. While <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone,</b> Harrison was left as acting governor.|$|E
25|$|Only 74 overs were bowled on {{the third}} day, with rain ending play at tea. Michael di Venuto put up the Derbyshire resistance, scoring 111 in an innings that {{included}} 12 fours and 1 six before finally being stumped off Gareth Batty. Steve Stubbings played the anchor role, and had made only 33 when the first wicket fell for 150. Batty bowled unchanged for a 32 over spell as Sheriyar and Wigley tried, and failed, to get di Venuto. Once <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone,</b> there was a flurry of wickets to 175 for 4. At close Derbyshire were within sight of a draw, being 11 runs behind with six wickets remaining.|$|E
25|$|Jackson {{said that}} he was not {{concerned}} or focused on the events in Lucky's life while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone,</b> stating: “You can't act information and you can't act history (...) That's what happened and that's what he's gone through, and that's that.” Jackson felt {{the heart and soul of}} the character were still the same; the foundation of Lucky was still the product of Luke and Laura. He described his portrayal as working through the contradictory traits Lucky inherited from his parents, the purity of Laura versus the con artist side of Luke. He explained that he was taking the essence of being their son and translating him into adulthood.|$|E

25|$|Denmark were {{batted out}} of the game by Bas Zuiderent and Daan van Bunge who both made centuries as the Danish spin bowling was taken to all corners. Van Bunge made 137 and Zuiderent 107 as the Dutch amassed 314 for 6, also helped by Ryan ten Doeschate who made 32. Despite Thomas Hansen bowling a maiden and taking three for 41, it was not enough. In reply, the Danes were in with a shout as long as Frederik Klokker was at the crease, but when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> for 52, it was quickly over. The Danes crawled to 225 all out, not a bad score by their standards, but still {{defeated}} by 89 runs.|$|E
25|$|General P. G. T. Beauregard {{commanded}} the Confederate Department of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. As he {{had led the}} rebel forces at Charleston {{at the time of}} the bombardment of Fort Sumter that opened the war, he was intimately familiar with the fortifications surrounding the city. He had been called away to service elsewhere, but returned in September 1862. The batteries that had been set up under his supervision to assault the fort were incorporated into the harbor defenses. His successors, Major General John C. Pemberton and Brigadier General Roswell S. Ripley, made some additions in the year and a half that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone,</b> but the basic features were due to Beauregard.|$|E
25|$|Davis Lynch: {{played by}} Mark Harelik, Davis is a {{businessman}} Joe flies to Nantucket {{to invest in}} the airline. Though he rejects Joe's offer (and ends up investing the money in Roy's airline), he ends up dating Helen, and eventually proposes to her. Helen accepts, but ends up leaving him for Joe. Toward the end of the series, Helen reveals she never broke off the engagement. She had figured <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> after he was skirted off to Burma {{in the wake of a}} coup d'etat to salvage major investments he had in the company. He was then placed under house arrest by the military junta. Upon his release, Davis returns to see Helen, but while she is trying to work up the courage to tell him she has married someone else, Davis announces that he will be unable to marry her, having fallen in love with a woman who worked for the State Department and had risked her life to secure his release.|$|E
