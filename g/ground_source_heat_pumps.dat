40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel design method for <b>ground</b> <b>source</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pump.</b> The <b>ground</b> <b>source</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> {{operation}} is controllable by using several parameters, {{such as the}} total meters of buried pipe, the space between wells, the thermal properties of soil, thermal resistance of the well, the initial temperature of soil, and annual dynamic load.

40|$|<b>Ground</b> <b>source</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> system attracts {{increasing}} attention {{worldwide in}} the past decades. It uses soil as the heat source/sink to supply heating and cooling to buildings. In the cooling dominated area, <b>ground</b> <b>source</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> system couples with the supplemental heat rejecter to avoid the unbalance underground, which is called the hybrid <b>ground</b> <b>source</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> system. The control strategy of the ground heat exchanger and cooling tower {{is very important to}} optimize the performance of the hybrid <b>ground</b> <b>source</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> systems. A new control strategy is proposed, which is to compare the cooling water temperature exiting the ground heat exchanger and cooling tower directly. Models based on artificial neural networks are built to realize the proposed control method. Four years' performance of the hybrid <b>ground</b> <b>source</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> system controlled based on the new method is calculated and compared with another two frequently used methods.

25|$|Heat pumps may obtain {{low-grade heat}} from the outdoor air in mild climates. In areas with average winter {{temperatures}} well below freezing, <b>ground</b> <b>source</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> are more efficient than air-source heat pumps because they can extract residual solar heat stored in the ground at warmer temperatures than is available from cold air. According to the US EPA, geothermal heat pumps can reduce energy consumption up to 44% compared with air source heat pumps and up to 72% compared with electric resistance heating. The high purchase price of a heat pump vs resistance heaters may be offset when air conditioning is also needed.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{concluded}} that heat pumps are the single technology that {{could reduce the}} greenhouse gas emissions of households better than every other technology that {{is available on the}} market. With a market share of 30% and (potentially) clean electricity, heat pumps could reduce global CO2 emissions by 8% annually. Using <b>ground</b> <b>source</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> could reduce around 60% of the primary energy demand and 90% of CO2 emissions in Europe in 2050 and make handling high shares of renewable energy easier. Using surplus renewable energy in heat pumps is regarded as the most effective household means to reduce global warming and fossil fuel depletion.|$|E
2500|$|Geothermal {{heat pumps}} or ground-source heat pumps use shallow {{underground}} heat exchangers as a heat source or sink, and water as the heat transfer medium. [...] This is possible because below ground level, {{the temperature is}} relatively constant across the seasons, and the earth can provide or absorb {{a large amount of}} heat. <b>Ground</b> <b>source</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> work {{in the same way as}} air-source heat pumps, but exchange heat with the ground via water pumped through pipes in the ground. <b>Ground</b> <b>source</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> are more simple and therefore more reliable than air source heat pumps as they do not need fan or defrosting systems and can be housed inside. Although a ground heat exchanger requires a higher initial capital cost, the annual running costs are lower, because well-designed ground source heat pump systems operate more efficiently because they start with a warmer source temperature than the air in winter.|$|E
