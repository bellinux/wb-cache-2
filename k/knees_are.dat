25|$|Uppercut – A vertical, rising punch thrown {{with the}} rear hand. From the guard position, the torso shifts {{slightly}} to the right, the rear hand drops {{below the level of}} the opponent's chest and the <b>knees</b> <b>are</b> bent slightly. From this position, the rear hand is thrust upwards in a rising arc towards the opponent's chin or torso.|$|E
40|$|The {{model of}} {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) geometric <b>knee</b> <b>was</b> built, which included femoral-tibial, patellofemoral articulations and {{the bone and}} soft tissues. Dynamic finite element (FE) model of <b>knee</b> <b>was</b> developed to simulate both the kinematics and the internal stresses during knee flexion. The biomechanical experimental system of <b>knee</b> <b>was</b> built to simulate knee squatting using cadaver knees. The flexion motion and dynamic contact characteristics of <b>knee</b> <b>were</b> analyzed, and verified by comparing with the data from in vitro experiment. The {{results showed that the}} established dynamic FE models of <b>knee</b> <b>are</b> capable of predicting kinematics and the contact stresses during flexion, and could be an efficient tool for the analysis of total knee replacement (TKR) and knee prosthesis design...|$|R

25|$|Sugar beet is an {{important}} source of sugar. Yam roots are a source of estrogen compounds used in birth control pills. The fish poison and insecticide rotenone is obtained from roots of Lonchocarpus spp. Important medicines from roots are ginseng, aconite, ipecac, gentian and reserpine. Several legumes that have nitrogen-fixing root nodules are used as green manure crops, which provide nitrogen fertilizer for other crops when plowed under. Specialized bald cypress roots, termed <b>knees,</b> <b>are</b> sold as souvenirs, lamp bases and carved into folk art. Native Americans used the flexible roots of white spruce for basketry.|$|E
25|$|Every Hybrid III {{undergoes}} calibration {{prior to}} a crash test. Its head is removed and is dropped from 40 centimetres to test calibrate the head instrumentation. Then {{the head and neck}} are reattached, set in motion, and stopped abruptly to check for proper neck flexure. Hybrids wear chamois leather skin; the <b>knees</b> <b>are</b> struck with a metal probe to check for proper puncture. Finally, the head and neck are attached to the body, which is attached to a test platform and struck violently in the chest by a heavy pendulum to ensure that the ribs bend and flex as they should.|$|E
25|$|The {{backward}} reclining {{figure of}} the chacmool presents a defenceless, passive appearance and has been likened by Miller to the positioning of captives in Classic period Maya sculpture and painting. Bent elbows and <b>knees</b> <b>are</b> common in depictions of Maya captives; the full-frontal view of the face is rare in Maya art except among representations of captives. The form of the Chichen Itza chacmools lacks the typical traits of Maya deities and most scholars have assumed that the iconography of Maya chacmools is equivalent {{to that of the}} central Mexican examples. Eduard Seler commented in the early 1960s that chacmools in Chichen Itza tended to be located in temple antechambers, where the bowl or disc gripped by the figure served to receive pulque as an offering.|$|E
5000|$|Lasègue's sign: a sign {{often seen}} in sciatica or with lumbar disc problems. In sciatica, flexion of the hip is painful when the <b>knee</b> <b>is</b> extended, but pain-free when the <b>knee</b> <b>is</b> flexed.|$|R

50|$|Jumper's <b>knee</b> <b>is</b> injury {{term used}} in volleyball circles that {{describes}} the mechanism of the injury known as patella tendinopathy, patella tendinosis or patella tendonitis. Jumper's <b>knee</b> <b>is</b> defined as a syndrome of tendon pain, localized tenderness and that is detrimental to an athletes performance. in the initial phase of the Jumper's knee injury the tendons with the <b>knee</b> <b>are</b> usually inflamed. If Jumper's knee becomes a chronic injury ,which usually occurs as age increases, the tendons show an increasing degree of degeneration and little to no inflation present. As the etiology and pathology of Jumper's <b>knee</b> <b>is</b> not known the treatment varies and is largely based on a trial and error basis. Jumpers <b>knee</b> <b>is</b> said to occur after frequent actions involving quick accelerations and declarations, eccentric activities and quick cutting actions. As spiking involves jumping, in which a quick acceleration occurs when jumping and quick deceleration when landing, this action is a possible cause of Jumper's <b>knee.</b> Also blocking <b>is</b> a possible cause of Jumper's knee because it to involves jumping and landing quickly. However, Jumper's <b>knee</b> <b>is</b> less common among athletes who compete in beach volleyball rather than those who play indoor volleyball. This is because beach volleyball is played on sand which reduces the impact of landing on the knee.|$|R
25|$|The {{conception}} of symmetry is {{explained in the}} following way: One imagines a man sitting in the paryanka posture, i.e. crossing the legs and placing the hands over the navel. If one imagines that the two <b>knees</b> <b>are</b> joined by a line, and from the right shoulder to the left knee, and from the left shoulder to the right knee, and from the forehead to the hands, a straight line is drawn, one gets four lines. If these are equal to one another, symmetry is apparent; {{if they are not}} so, one of the other 5 samsthanas results. Gods have only the first symmetry, infernal beings and jivas who have been produced through coagulation only the 6th figure; in the case of animals and men (also of kevalins) all six samsthanas are to be found.|$|E
25|$|Stance width helps {{determine}} the rider's {{balance on the}} board. The size of the rider {{is an important factor}} as well as the style of their riding when determining a proper stance width. A common measurement used for new riders is to position the bindings so that the feet are placed a little wider than shoulder width apart. Another, less orthodox form of measurement may be taken by putting your feet together and place your hands, palm down, on the ground in a straight line with your body by squatting down. This generally gives a good natural measurement for how wide of a base your body uses to properly balance itself when <b>knees</b> <b>are</b> bent. However, personal preference and comfort are important and most experienced riders will adjust the stance width to personal preference. Skateboarders should find that their snowboarding and skateboarding stance widths are relatively similar.|$|E
500|$|Flexion {{describes}} a bending movement that decreases the angle between a segment and its proximal segment. [...] For example, bending the elbow, or clenching a {{hand into a}} fist, are examples of flexion. When sitting down, the <b>knees</b> <b>are</b> flexed. When a joint can move forward and backward, such as the neck and trunk, flexion refers to movement in the anterior direction. Flexion of the shoulder or hip refers to movement of the arm or leg forward.|$|E
30|$|The {{drift of}} the stories under seismic forces is higher in the knee members with great length and weak moment of inertia, and, as a result, when {{the length of the}} <b>knee</b> <b>is</b> greater, the use of lower moments of inertia for the <b>knee</b> <b>is</b> not recommended.|$|R
30|$|Firstly the <b>knee</b> <b>was</b> tested intact, and {{static and}} dynamic {{measurements}} recorded. After the intact <b>knee</b> <b>was</b> tested, the ACL was entirely cut, using an open technique through a minimally invasive medial parapatellar arthrotomy. The arthrotomy was then closed and both static and dynamic measurements recorded.|$|R
30|$|We further {{demonstrated}} {{that the rate of}} TT–TG change was significantly negatively correlated with length, weight, and BMI. In other words, the effect of <b>knee</b> angle <b>was</b> greater in smaller subjects. This finding is particularly relevant since patellar instability is common among adolescents. Our present data indicate a need to standardize the TT–TG measurement protocol to avoid overlooking pathology, especially in adolescents. We suggest that the <b>knee</b> should <b>be</b> fully extended for imaging. Moreover, quadriceps should be at rest as the muscle contraction may impact TT-TG measures. If the <b>knee</b> <b>is</b> not fully extended this should be taken in account. Data in adults indicate that as the <b>knee</b> <b>is</b> flexed the TG deviates laterally in relation to the starting point when the <b>knee</b> <b>is</b> in extension (Iranpour et al. 2010). Rotation of the <b>knee</b> should <b>be</b> taken in account also. In the present study there was no problem to find out the groove because study subjects were healthy children, not patients with dysplasia.|$|R
500|$|Extension is the {{opposite}} of flexion, describing a straightening movement that increases the angle between body parts. When a joint can move forward and backward, such as the neck and trunk, extension refers to movement in the posterior direction. For example, when standing up, the <b>knees</b> <b>are</b> extended. Extension of the hip or shoulder moves the arm or leg backward. When the chin is against the chest, the head is flexed, and the trunk is flexed when a person leans forward.|$|E

[...] "If I had been , I would've ended up on crutches," [...] she told Emmy magazine. In an interview with HitFix she said, [...] "I have new respect for the craft, because I slightly hurt myself during the pilot, coming down from one of the stunts. It's better now. I didn't tear something in my knee, but I strained it. <b>Knees</b> <b>are</b> very sensitive, I've learned. It's crazy, because I've been dancing since I was three on my toes and all these things. And you should never say this, but I've never injured myself ever. I'd seen gnarly injuries with dance and all these things. You shouldn't say that, though, because every day is an opportunity to fall, hurt yourself, so that was my experience." ...|$|E

50|$|Another error where {{health of}} the <b>knee</b> joint <b>is</b> {{concerned}} <b>is</b> when the <b>knee</b> <b>is</b> not aligned with {{the direction of the}} toes. If the <b>knee</b> <b>is</b> not tracking over the toes during the movement this results in twisting/shearing of the joint and unwanted torque affecting the ligaments which can soon result in injury. The knee should always follow the toe. Have your toes slightly pointed out in order to track the knee properly.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} in unlimited. Previous studies of human <b>knee</b> motion <b>are</b> based on finite rotation data collected using large rotation steps varying from 5 to 30 degrees. In some cases this rotation data {{is used to}} develop axes of rotation for the joint. For such analysis, the rotation axis developed may be {{significantly different from the}} joint's instantaneous axis of rotation because, in general, the axis of rotation developed using finite rotation steps only closely approximates the true instantaneous axis of rotation if the step size is small. For the current study, a device has been developed to record high frequency (15 Hz) rotation and translation data of the femur and tibia during knee flexion. Kinematic constraint equations have been developed to analyze the six degree of freedom rotation and translation data to obtain an accurate approximation to the instantaneous axis of rotation. Four cadaveric <b>knees</b> <b>were</b> II analyzed with all ligaments intact. Motion characteristics common to all <b>knees</b> <b>were</b> identified. The most obvious characteristic, internal tibial rotation, was related to the initial varus/valgus orientation of each knee.

2500|$|The taolu (solo [...] "forms") {{should take}} the {{students}} through a complete, natural range of motion over their centre of gravity. Accurate, repeated practice of the solo routine is said to retrain posture, encourage circulation throughout the students' bodies, maintain flexibility through their joints, and further familiarize students with the martial application sequences implied by the various forms. The major traditional styles of tàijíquán have forms that differ somewhat in terms of aesthetics, {{but there are also}} many obvious similarities that point to their common origin. The solo forms (empty-hand and weapon) are catalogues of movements that are practised individually in pushing hands and martial application scenarios to prepare students for self-defence training. In most traditional schools, different variations of the solo forms can be practised: fast / slow, small-circle / large-circle, square / round (which are different expressions of leverage through the joints), low-sitting / high-sitting (the degree to which weight-bearing <b>knees</b> <b>are</b> kept bent throughout the form), for example.|$|E
2500|$|After {{a series}} of {{setbacks}} including further surgeries on his knees, Martínez fought again over {{a year after the}} Murray fight, losing his WBC, The Ring and lineal middleweight titles to three-division former world champion Miguel Cotto on June 7, 2014, at Madison Square Garden in New York City. It was evident straight away that Martinez's legs were not there, even with knee braces on and clearly visible, Cotto knocked Martínez down three times in the first round. After the first round however, he begun to make the fight competitive with Cotto. He continued to fight back until round nine when Martínez went down once again. Following the ninth round, trainer Pablo Sarmiento decided to call off the fight prior to the tenth round while still in the corner, against the urging of Martínez. According to reports, Sarmiento told Martínez [...] "Champion, your <b>knees</b> <b>are</b> not responding. Sergio, look at me ... I'm gonna stop this one. Sergio, you are the best for me. You'll always be the best champion, Sergio." ...|$|E
2500|$|The leg movement, colloquially {{known as}} the [...] "frog kick" [...] or [...] "whip kick", {{consists}} of two phases: bringing the feet into position for the thrust phase and the insweep phase. From the initial position with the legs stretched out backward, the feet are moved together towards the posterior, while the knees stay together. The knees should not sink too low, as this increases the drag. Then the feet point outward {{in preparation for the}} thrust phase. In the thrust phase, the legs are moved elliptically back to the initial position. During this movement, the <b>knees</b> <b>are</b> kept together. The legs move slower while bringing the legs into position for the thrust phase, and move very fast during the thrust phase. Again, the goal is to produce maximum thrust during the insweep phase, and minimise drag during the recovery phase. In the recovery phase the lower leg and the feet are {{in the wake of the}} upper leg, and the feet are pointed to the rear. In the thrust phase all three parts create their own wake, and the flat end of the feet acts like a hydrofoil aligned to give maximum forward thrust. The resulting drag coefficient (or more precisely the frontal area) is thus doubled in the thrust phase.|$|E
