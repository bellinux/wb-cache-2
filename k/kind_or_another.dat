Wrestling and boxing thus were popular subjects for artworks, and Etty had produced other paintings and sketches of men engaged in fights of one <b>kind</b> <b>or</b> <b>another.</b> It had become common for artists to use boxers and soldiers as models, as they had the strength and bearing considered desirable, and the discipline to hold a pose for long periods in the studio.|$|E

25|$|Further acclaim {{greeted the}} {{director}} in 1996 with Les voleurs (Thieves) (1996), an ambitious and complex crime drama. The film jumps through time and switches narrative perspectives in a Rashomon-style exploring family and amorous ties.

Even with these small fairies, however, their small size may be magically assumed rather than constant. Some fairies though normally quite small were able to dilate their figures to imitate humans. On Orkney they were described as short in stature, dressed in dark grey, and sometimes seen in armour.|$|E

50|$|As {{in some of}} {{his other}} early novels, Gilbert {{does not seem to have}} made up his mind about what kind of a {{narrative}} style to use. It is a third-person narrative, told by an omniscient narrator, but it veers between straightforward description, somewhat chatty semi-humorousness or facetiousness, and occasional hard-boiled grimness. It might in fact, be an early prototype of what later came to be called a caper novel. However, befitting Gilbert's status as a practicing solicitor, there are also numerous scenes set in one <b>kind</b> of court <b>or</b> <b>another,</b> and a number of other scenes revolving around finance and financial institutions, all of them done with his customary expertise.|$|R
40|$|Classical {{rationality}} as {{accepted by}} game theory assumes {{that a human}} chooser in a given moment has consistent preferences and beliefs and that actions result consistently from those preferences and beliefs, and moreover that these preferences, beliefs, and actions remain the same across equal choice moments. Since, as is widely found in prior experiments, subjects do not follow the predictions of classical rationality, behavioral game theorists have assumed consistent deviations from classical rationality by assigning to subjects certain dispositions— risk preference, cognitive abilities, social norms, etc. All of these theories are fundamentally cognitive theories, making claims about how individual human minds work when choosing. All of them are fundamentally wrong in assuming one <b>kind</b> of consistency <b>or</b> <b>another.</b> <b>Or</b> at least, all of the proposals for consistency in belief, preference, and action with which we are aware {{turn out to be}} wrong when tested experimentally...|$|R

500|$|Other {{critics have}} argued for similar analogues between Andrade's {{sexuality}} and Macunaíma's complex status. [...] Though Andrade was not openly gay, {{and there is}} no direct evidence of his sexual practices, many of Andrade's friends have reported after his death that he was clearly interested in men (the subject is only reluctantly discussed in Brazil). [...] It was over a pseudonymous accusation of effeminacy that Andrade broke with Oswald de Andrade in 1929. [...] Macunaíma prefers women, but his constant state of belonging and not belonging is associated with sex. [...] The character is sexually precocious, starting his romantic adventures at the age of six, and his particular form of eroticism seems always to lead to destruction of one <b>kind</b> <b>or</b> <b>another.</b>|$|E

60|$|There were a {{great many}} things which seem to us at the present day of very little consequence, which were then the {{subjects}} of endless disputes and of the most bitter animosity. For instance, one point was whether {{the place where the}} communion was to be administered should be called the communion table or the altar; and in what part of the church it should stand; and whether the person officiating should be called a priest or a clergyman; and whether he should wear one <b>kind</b> of dress <b>or</b> <b>another.</b> Great importance was attached to these things; but it was not on their own account, but on account of their bearing on the question whether the Lord's Supper was to be considered only a ceremony commemorative of Christ's death, or whether it was, whenever celebrated by a regularly authorized priest, a real renewal of the sacrifice of Christ, as the Catholics maintained. Calling the communion table an altar, and the officiating minister a priest, and clothing him in a sacerdotal garb, countenanced the idea of a renewal of the sacrifice of Christ. Laud and his co-adjutors urged the adoption of all these and similar usages. The Puritans detested them, because they detested and abhorred the doctrine which they seemed to imply.|$|R

2500|$|Meanwhile, the {{definitive}} liberal {{response to the}} Great Depression was given by the British economist John Maynard Keynes, who had begun a theoretical work examining the relationship between unemployment, money and prices back in the 1920s.

Upon his first sight of the Bay the former Emperor has been quoted as exclaiming [...] "Quel Bon Pays" [...] ("what a lovely country") and he compared it favourably to Porto Ferrago on Elba. Napoleon also helped the prosperity of Torquay in another way: local smugglers did very good business 'importing' French brandy during the Napoleonic Wars and since then smuggling of one <b>kind</b> <b>or</b> <b>another</b> has not completely stopped.

30|$|Each {{person has}} varied {{opportunities}} she values, and mobility {{is required to}} reach them. In fact, the land use features define “the amount, quality and spatial distribution opportunities supplied at each destination (jobs, shops, health, social and recreational facilities, etc.), the demand for these opportunities at origin locations (e.g. where inhabitants live), and the confrontation of supply of and demand for opportunities, which may result in competition for activities with restricted capacity such as job and school vacancies and hospital beds” (Dijst et al. 2013, pp. 209 – 210). Each person has different capacities to freely move, depending on personal features {{as well as on}} the “possible mobilities according to place, time and other contextual constraints” (Kaufmann et al. 2004, p. 750). Transport systems—and the TransMilenio here discussed—contribute to these possible mobilities. Depending on a personal choice, each person can decide to put into practice such capacity to move, and accessibility to valued opportunities lies amongst its possible uses. Opportunities include a range of resources and activities necessary for the freedom that each individual has to lead one <b>kind</b> of life <b>or</b> <b>another</b> (Nussbaum and Sen 1993) and for the participation to social life. Identifying development with the possibility for everyone to flourish according to what she has reason to value (Nussbaum 2000), individual freedom becomes a social commitment (Sen 1999).|$|R
