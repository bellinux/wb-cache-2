Shorter time scales mostly arise from currents in the ionosphere (ionospheric dynamo region) and magnetosphere, and some changes {{can be traced to}} geomagnetic storms or daily variations in currents. Changes over time scales of a year or more mostly reflect changes in the Earth's interior, particularly the iron-rich core.|$|E

5|$|At present, {{the overall}} <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>field</b> is {{becoming}} weaker; the present strong deterioration {{corresponds to a}} 10–15% decline over the last 150 years and has accelerated {{in the past several}} years; geomagnetic intensity has declined almost continuously from a maximum 35% above the modern value achieved approximately 2,000 years ago. The rate of decrease and the current strength are within the normal range of variation, as shown by the record of past magnetic fields recorded in rocks.|$|E
30|$|The {{purpose of}} the current study is to {{investigate}} the possibility to utilise the spatial changes in the scaling properties of the <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>field’s</b> fluctuations as a local indicator of the overall magnetosphere–ionosphere coupling conditions and of the plasma convection structures during geomagnetic storms. For this reason, we have analysed the changes in the scaling properties of the <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>field’s</b> fluctuations recorded at high latitude by the Swarm constellation.|$|R

30|$|Computation of Z′(ω) {{was done}} by using the bounded {{influence}} remote-reference processing (BIRRP) program developed by Chave and Thomson (2004). The value of Z′(ω) at periods shorter than 104 s was obtained by simply applying BIRRP to the observed geoelectric and <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>fields,</b> based on the high coherence between them. On the other hand, the corrected electric field E(t) − T(t) is used at periods longer than 104 s to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, the Sq signal is removed before the spectral analysis by fitting sinusoids with a 24 -hour period and related harmonics to the geoelectric and <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>fields.</b>|$|R
5|$|Earth {{has evolved}} through {{geological}} and biological processes that have left {{traces of the}} original conditions. The outer surface is divided into several gradually migrating tectonic plates. The interior remains active, with {{a thick layer of}} plastic mantle and an iron-filled core that generates a magnetic field. This iron core is composed of a solid inner phase, and a fluid outer phase. Convective motion in the core generates electric currents through dynamo action, and these, in turn, generate the <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>field.</b>|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{magnetic}} field, {{also known}} as the <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>field,</b> is the magnetic field that extends from the Earth's interior out into space, where it meets the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun. Its magnitude at the Earth's surface ranges from 25 to 65microteslas (0.25 to 0.65gauss). Roughly speaking it is the field of a magnetic dipole currently tilted at an angle of about 11 degrees with respect to Earth's rotational axis, as if there were a bar magnet placed at that angle {{at the center of the}} Earth. The North geomagnetic pole, located near Greenland in the northern hemisphere, is actually the south pole of the Earth's magnetic field, and the South geomagnetic pole is the north pole. Unlike a bar magnet, Earth's magnetic field changes over time because it is generated by a geodynamo (in Earth's case, the motion of molten iron alloys in its outer core).|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} Earth's {{magnetic}} field in space defines the magnetosphere. Ions and electrons {{of the solar}} wind are deflected by the magnetosphere; solar wind pressure compresses the dayside of the magnetosphere, to about 10 Earth radii, and extends the nightside magnetosphere into a long tail. Because the velocity of the solar wind {{is greater than the}} speed at which waves propagate through the solar wind, a supersonic bowshock precedes the dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind. Charged particles are contained within the magnetosphere; the plasmasphere is defined by low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as Earth rotates; the ring current is defined by medium-energy particles that drift relative to the <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>field,</b> but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field, and the Van Allen radiation belt are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random, but otherwise contained by the magnetosphere.|$|E
30|$|The geoelectric field drives geomagnetically induced {{currents}} (GIC) in ground-based technological networks. This {{process has}} a dc character, {{which means that}} GIC follow the time behaviour of the electric field. Thus the conclusions about {{the relation between the}} geoelectric and <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>fields</b> are directly applicable to GIC and the magnetic field.|$|R
40|$|Magnetic torquers are {{specifically}} designed to generate a magnetic field onboard the satellites for their attitude control.

25|$|The A- and K-indices are a {{measurement}} {{of the behavior of}} the horizontal component of the <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>field.</b> The K-index uses a scale from 0 to 9 to measure the change in the horizontal component of the <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>field.</b> A new K-index is determined at the Boulder Geomagnetic Observatory.|$|E
25|$|Following {{laboratory}} tests of molten iron, European scientists {{determine that the}} Earth's core has a temperature of 6,000 degrees Celsius, 1,000 degrees hotter than previously thought. This discovery {{may help explain why}} the planet has such a strong <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>field.</b>|$|E
25|$|The high {{latitude}} magnetosphere {{is filled}} with plasma as the solar wind passes the Earth. The flow of plasma into the magnetosphere increases with additional turbulence, density and speed in the solar wind. This flow is favoured by a southward component of the IMF, which can then directly connect to the high latitude <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>field</b> lines. The flow pattern of magnetospheric plasma is mainly from the magnetotail toward the Earth, around the Earth {{and back into the}} solar wind through the magnetopause on the day-side. In addition to moving perpendicular to the Earth's magnetic field, some magnetospheric plasma travels down along the Earth's magnetic field lines, gains additional energy and loses it to the atmosphere in the auroral zones. The cusps of the magnetosphere, separating <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>field</b> lines that close through the Earth from those that close remotely allow a small amount of solar wind to directly reach the top of the atmosphere, producing an auroral glow.|$|E

25|$|The Geophysical Institute of Tromsø {{established}} a geophysical station at Kvadehuken in 1920, {{consisting of a}} small hut and a radio mast allowing communication via Ny-Ålesund. It carried out meteorological surveys and <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>field</b> measurements and was manned by four men. Two of these died in February 1922 while attempting to rescue a trapper. The station was closed in 1924 {{due to lack of}} funding. The Church of Norway never {{established a}} presence in Ny-Ålesund, although the minister at Svalbard Church in Longyearbyen visited Ny-Ålesund irregularly. Most of the children in town were below school age. However, during the 1920–21 winter there were 23 children in town and an improvised school was taken into use for the year.|$|E
25|$|The most {{distinctive}} and brightest are the curtain-like auroral arcs. Each curtain consists of many parallel rays, each {{lined up with}} the local direction of the magnetic field, consistent with auroras being shaped by Earth's magnetic field. In-situ particle measurements confirm that auroral electrons are guided by the <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>field,</b> and spiral around them while moving toward Earth. The similarity of an auroral display to curtains is often enhanced by folds within the arcs. Arcs can fragment or 'break-up' into separate, at times rapidly changing, often rayed features that may fill the whole sky. These are the 'discrete' auroras, which are at times bright enough to read a newspaper by at night. and can display rapid sub-second variations in intensity.|$|E
25|$|The {{solar wind}} and the magnetosphere, being two {{electrically}} conducting fluids in relative motion, should be able in principle to generate electric currents by dynamo action and impart energy from {{the flow of the}} solar wind. However, this process is hampered by the fact that plasmas conduct readily along magnetic field lines, but less readily perpendicular to them. Energy is more effectively transferred by temporary magnetic connection between the field lines of the solar wind and those of the magnetosphere. Unsurprisingly this process is known as magnetic reconnection. As already mentioned, it happens most readily when the interplanetary field is directed southward, in a similar direction to the <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>field</b> in the inner regions of both the north magnetic pole and south magnetic pole.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the inversion of <b>geomagnetic</b> variation <b>field</b> measurement to obtain source currents in the ionosphere. During a geomagnetic disturbance, the ionospheric currents create magnetic field variations that induce geoelectric fields, which drive geomagnetically induced currents (GIC) in power systems. These GIC may disturb the operation of power systems and cause damage to grounded power transformers. The geoelectric fields at any location of interest can be determined from the source currents in the ionosphere through a solution of the forward problem. Line currents running east–west along given surface position are postulated to exist at a certain height above the Earth's surface. This physical arrangement results in the fields on the ground having the magnetic north and down components, and the electric east component. Ionospheric currents are modelled by inverting Fourier integrals (over the wavenumber) of elementary <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>fields</b> using the Levenberg–Marquardt technique. The output parameters of the inversion model are the current strength, height and surface position of the ionospheric current system. A ground conductivity structure with five layers from Quebec, Canada, based on the Layered-Earth model is used to obtain the complex skin depth at a given angular frequency. This paper presents preliminary and inversion results based on these structures and simulated <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>fields.</b> The results show some interesting features in the frequency domain. Model parameters obtained through inversion are within 2...|$|R
25|$|Ionization depends {{primarily}} on the Sun and its activity. The amount of ionization in the ionosphere varies greatly {{with the amount of}} radiation received from the Sun. Thus there is a diurnal (time of day) effect and a seasonal effect. The local winter hemisphere is tipped away from the Sun, thus there is less received solar radiation. The activity of the Sun is associated with the sunspot cycle, with more radiation occurring with more sunspots. Radiation received also varies with geographical location (polar, auroral zones, mid-latitudes, and equatorial regions). There are also mechanisms that disturb the ionosphere and decrease the ionization. There are disturbances such as solar flares and the associated release of charged particles into the solar wind which reaches the Earth and interacts with its <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>field.</b>|$|E
25|$|Geomagnetic {{storms that}} ignite auroras may occur more often {{during the months}} around the equinoxes. It is not well understood, but {{geomagnetic}} storms may vary with Earth's seasons. Two factors to consider are the tilt of both the solar and Earth's axis to the ecliptic plane. As the Earth orbits throughout a year, it experiences an interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) from different latitudes of the Sun, which is tilted at 8 degrees. Similarly, the 23 degree tilt of the Earth's axis about which the geomagnetic pole rotates with a diurnal variation, changes the daily average angle that the <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>field</b> presents to the incident IMF throughout a year. These factors combined can lead to minor cyclical changes in the detailed way that the IMF links to the magnetosphere. In turn, this affects the average probability of opening a door through which energy from the solar wind can reach the Earth's inner magnetosphere and thereby enhance auroras.|$|E
25|$|The Earth and {{all living}} things on it are {{constantly}} bombarded by radiation from outer space. This radiation primarily consists of positively charged ions from protons to iron and larger nuclei derived sources outside our solar system. This radiation interacts with atoms in the atmosphere to create an air shower of secondary radiation, including X-rays, muons, protons, alpha particles, pions, electrons, and neutrons. The immediate dose from cosmic radiation is largely from muons, neutrons, and electrons, and this dose varies {{in different parts of}} the world based largely on the <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>field</b> and altitude. For example, the city of Denver in the United States (at 1650 meters elevation) receives a cosmic ray dose roughly twice that of a location at sea level. This radiation is much more intense in the upper troposphere, around 10km altitude, and is thus of particular concern for airline crews and frequent passengers, who spend many hours per year in this environment. During their flights airline crews typically get an extra dose on the order of 2.2mSv (220 mrem) per year.|$|E
50|$|Rapidly {{fluctuating}} <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>fields</b> {{can produce}} geomagnetically induced currents in pipelines. This can cause multiple problems for pipeline engineers. Pipeline flow meters can transmit erroneous flow {{information and the}} corrosion rate of the pipeline is dramatically increased.

Pipeline managers thus receive space weather alerts and warnings {{to allow them to}} implement defensive measures.|$|R

30|$|Taking {{into account}} that for a scale-invariant signal there exists a direct {{relationship}} between {{the values of the}} Hurst exponent and of the exponent β of the power spectral density (β = 2 H+ 1) (Gilmore et al. 2002), our findings suggest that the regions where the magnetic field’s fluctuations have a persistent character correspond to regions where the <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>field’s</b> spectral density is characterised by an exponent greater than 2. Conversely, when the magnetic field’s fluctuations have an anti-persistent character, the <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>field’s</b> spectral density has an exponent less than 2. Considering that it has been found that the small-scale variations in the magnetic and electric fields are generally intermittently turbulent, our findings suggest that distinct turbulent regimes characterised the mesoscale magnetic field’s fluctuations and that some factors, which are known to influence large-scale fluctuations, have also an influence on mesoscale fluctuations. The results reported in Fig.  6 show that the scaling properties of the <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>field’s</b> fluctuations are influenced by geomagnetic activity as monitored by the AE and Sym-H and by interplanetary parameters. Furthermore, the comparison between the local Hurst exponent values along a single crossing of polar region and the corresponding average structure of global convection and polar cap potential as reconstructed using data from the SuperDARN (see Fig.  8) shows that gradients or shears in the background plasma drift can influence the nature of the magnetic field’s fluctuations. This suggests that plasma instabilities and gradients in the conductance can be a possible source of the observed different nature in the turbulence. Indeed, it possible to notice that: a) the structures of double-celled convection pattern are usually associated with those regions with a more persistent behaviour of the short timescale fluctuations and b) in the polar cap at latitudinal values above 80 ^∘ N the magnetic field’s fluctuations have an anti-persistent character.|$|R
