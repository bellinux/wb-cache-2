5|$|In 1977, having {{recovered}} from hip surgery, Al Costello {{teamed up with}} Kent as The Fabulous <b>Kangaroos</b> for a tour of Puerto Rico with the World Wrestling Council (WWC). In Puerto Rico, the <b>Kangaroos</b> were billed on arrival as the WWC World Tag Team Champions. The <b>Kangaroos</b> lost the title to Carlos Colón and Jose Rivera on March 12, 1977. The <b>Kangaroos</b> remained in WWC throughout 1977 and into 1978, never regaining the WWC World Tag Team Championship. After their tour in Puerto Rico ended, Don Kent returned to singles wrestling and Costello focused more on managing due to his bad hip.|$|E
5|$|Later {{versions}} of The <b>Kangaroos</b> saw Al Costello team with Ray St. Clair in 1967, {{and then with}} Don Kent from 1968 until 1974. Don Kent went on to team with Bruno Bekkar, and later Johnny Heffernan (a storyline cousin of Roy Heffernan) to keep The Fabulous <b>Kangaroos</b> name alive until 1983.|$|E
5|$|After a {{match in}} the Cincinnati Gardens, Costello's hip was damaged when an enraged fan threw a fire {{extinguisher}} from the balcony. Costello had hip replacement surgery later that year. The fan was arrested, served 15 days in jail, and was fined fifty dollars for damaging the fire extinguisher. With Costello unable to compete, the Fabulous <b>Kangaroos</b> split up. After the <b>Kangaroos</b> went {{their separate ways}} Don Kent returned to NWA Mid-America as a singles wrestler.|$|E

5|$|As {{was common}} in their day, The <b>Kangaroos</b> {{began to move}} around between territories to avoid overexposure. The team arrived in Championship Wrestling from Florida billed as NWA Florida United States Tag Team Champions. It was a tag team title they never {{technically}} won, but were instead awarded by the promoter. The <b>Kangaroos</b> stayed in Florida, defending against all challengers until the duo of Eddie Graham and Dick Steinborn took the United States titles from them in a match on 1 November 1961. In 1962, The <b>Kangaroos</b> once again traveled across the United States, working for the Midwest Wrestling Association of Ohio where they held the Ohio version of the NWA United States tag team title. They also toured Japan with the Japan Wrestling Association and {{were the first to}} hold the Japanese version of the NWA International Tag Team Championship. In 1964, Costello and Heffernan made their west coast debut, working in Los Angeles, California for the World Wrestling Association (WWA) where they beat Édouard Carpentier and Ernie Ladd for the WWA World Tag Team Championship. The <b>Kangaroos</b> held the titles for three months before losing them to the Torres brothers (Alberto and Ramon) on 28 April 1964.|$|E
5|$|Costello officially {{retired from}} wrestling in 1983 but still {{made a few}} brief returns to the ring after that. In 1993, he managed The New Fabulous <b>Kangaroos</b> (Denny Kass and Al Snow) before {{retiring}} completely from the wrestling business. Both Costello and his tag team partner Heffernan died before <b>Kangaroos</b> were honored as the first tag team to ever {{be inducted into the}} Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2003, which started a tradition of inducting a new team every year.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Kangaroos</b> frequented NWA Detroit, {{where they}} held the Detroit version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship for most of 1971. By the end of 1972, The <b>Kangaroos</b> began working for Nick Gulas’ NWA Mid-America. In Mid-America, {{they held the}} local version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship, the Mid-America version, on three occasions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Kangaroo</b> rats live {{in complex}} burrow systems. The burrows have {{separate}} chambers for specific purposes like sleeping, living and food storage. The spacing of the burrows {{depends on the}} number of <b>kangaroo</b> rats and the abundance of food. <b>Kangaroo</b> rats also live in colonies that range from six to several hundred dens. The burrow of a <b>kangaroo</b> rat is important in providing protection from the harsh desert environment. To maintain a constant temperature and relative humidity in their burrows, <b>kangaroo</b> rats plug the entrances with soil during the day. When the outside temperature is too hot, a <b>kangaroo</b> rat stays in its cool, humid burrow and leaves it only at night. To reduce loss of moisture through respiration when sleeping, a <b>kangaroo</b> rat buries its nose in its fur to accumulate a small pocket of moist air. The burrows of Merriam's <b>kangaroo</b> rats are simpler and shallower than those of banner-tailed <b>kangaroo</b> rats. Banner-tailed <b>kangaroo</b> rats also mate in their burrows, unlike Merriam's <b>kangaroo</b> rats.|$|R

5|$|Their time in Japan {{was only}} {{the first of many}} {{international}} tours for these third generation Kangaroos; they worked all over Asia as well as in Costello's homeland of Australia. In 1969, the <b>Kangaroos</b> wrestled for the newly created Eastern Sports Association (ESA) out of Halifax, Nova Scotia, where they were once again recognized as champions on their arrival, becoming the inaugural holders of the ESA International Tag Team Championship. On 5 August 1969, the <b>Kangaroos</b> dropped the titles to Eastern Sports Association mainstays The Beast and Rudy Kay. In 1970, they joined Dick the Bruiser’s World Wrestling Association (WWA), where they competed regularly for nearly two years. On 26 December 1970 Costello and Kent defeated WWA World Tag Team Champions Dick the Bruiser and Bill Miller to claim the tag titles. The <b>Kangaroos</b> used every dirty tactic {{to hold on to the}} gold for six months before losing the titles to Wilbur Snyder and Moose Cholak. On 18 June 1971, the <b>Kangaroos</b> regained the titles, and held them for just over two months before Wilbur Snyder and Paul Christy beat them for their straps. After leaving the WWA, Costello and Kent made a few appearances in New York for the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF), a promotion the original Fabulous <b>Kangaroos</b> (Al Costello and Roy Hefferman) had previously worked for under the company's former name, Capitol Wrestling. In one of their headline appearances at Madison Square Garden, the <b>Kangaroos</b> wrestled to a 45-minute time limit draw against Terry and Dory Funk, Sr..|$|E
5|$|Their time in NWA All-Star Wrestling was {{the last}} time the {{original}} <b>Kangaroos</b> teamed together. In June 1965, The <b>Kangaroos</b> lost to Don Leo Jonathan and Jim Hardy, and then split up.

50|$|<b>Kangaroo</b> {{meat was}} legalized for human {{consumption}} in South Australia in 1980, and in all other Australian states in 1993. <b>Kangaroo</b> was once limited in availability, although consumption in Australia is becoming more widespread. However, only 14.5% of Australians were reported in 2008 as eating <b>kangaroo</b> meat {{at least four times}} per year. Many Australian supermarkets now stock various cuts of <b>kangaroo</b> including fillets, steaks, minced meat and 'Kanga Bangas' (<b>kangaroo</b> sausages).

5|$|In 1967, Al Costello {{reformed}} the tag team The Fabulous <b>Kangaroos</b> with Ray St. Clair {{who retired}} {{after six months}} with knee problems. A few months after St. Clair retired, Costello found Don Kent to don the bush hat. Kent, who was from Michigan, adopted the Ultra-Australian gimmick (but retained his American accent) and a second version of the Fabulous <b>Kangaroos</b> was formed. Costello and Kent teamed together {{on a regular basis}} from 1968 until 1974, approximately {{the same amount of time}} that Costello spent teaming with his original partner Roy Heffernan. The <b>Kangaroos</b> won their first tag team championship a few months after teaming up, during a tour of Japan for “International Wrestling Enterprise". Over the years, they defended their title in promotions around the globe. In Canada, they were the first Eastern Sports Association International Tag Team Champions; in the World Wrestling Association, they held the WWA World Tag Team Championship twice. In addition to winning titles all over North America, they also made appearances for the World Wide Wrestling Federation (now known as World Wrestling Entertainment.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Costello teamed Kent with Bruno Bekkar, who {{was best}} known for working in his native New Zealand and Australia, and work a tour as The <b>Kangaroos</b> for the WWC with Costello serving as their manager. Kent and Bekkar won the WWC North American Tag Team title from the team of Jack and Jerry Brisco on October 22, 1981. This version of the <b>Kangaroos</b> first lost to, then regained the titles from, Invader I and Super Gladiador before losing them for good on January 26, 1982 to Invader and Gladiador. After this tour of the Caribbean, Bruno Bekkar {{returned}} to Australia and New Zealand {{to work for the}} local promotions there.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Kangaroos</b> {{never forgot}} their roots and {{continued}} to work in Canada off and on through the years; in addition to Stampede Wrestling, the team also worked for NWA All-Star Wrestling based in Vancouver, British Columbia. Costello featured in a National Film Board of Canada short subject La Lotta/Wrestling/Le Catch. Their stint in NWA All-Star Wrestling {{was the last time}} Costello and Heffernan teamed together. In June 1965, The <b>Kangaroos</b> lost to Don Leo Jonathan and Jim Hardy and then split up.

2500|$|<b>Kangaroo</b> rats inhabit {{overlapping}} home ranges. These home ranges tend to {{be small}} with most [...] activities within 200–300ft and rarely 600ft.

50|$|Unlike the American {{equivalent}} (Florida Cow Whip {{which is}} made of inexpensive nylon) an Australian stockwhip is usually made of redhide or sometimes greenhide leather but can also be made of <b>kangaroo</b> hide. Because a <b>kangaroo</b> is a native animal, and cattle are a lot cheaper and abundant, <b>kangaroo</b> hide stockwhips are more expensive. Only the most expensive whips are made from <b>kangaroo</b> hide and they often have a fully plaited handle. <b>Kangaroo</b> hide allows the whip maker to produce the fine plaits for which the <b>kangaroo</b> leather stockwhip is renowned.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Kangaroo</b> rats drum their feet. Many {{different}} species of <b>kangaroo</b> rats' drumming pattern have been previously studied. They {{are thought to have}} evolved independently. Some use drumming to communicate location and other <b>kangaroo</b> rats respond in kind. This is not the case with the desert <b>kangaroo</b> rat. [...] The desert <b>kangaroo</b> rat, living in a sand dune environment, has the highest level of food scarcity. When the desert <b>kangaroo</b> rat hears a drum from another rat, it comes out of its burrow and chases it away or engages in a rollover fight.|$|R

40|$|<b>Kangaroo</b> meat is a {{suitable}} {{alternative to a}} diet diversification. Thanks to its low fat and high protein content is <b>kangaroo</b> meat considered as diet meat, and it is recommended for healthy eating. Slaughtering involves shooting a <b>kangaroo</b> in the wild, with one gunshot, subsequent bleeding, evisceration and transport by a mobile refrigeration truck to a processing plant. In these processing plants takes place skinning, veterinary inspection of bodies, carving and ensuing packing or further processing. <b>Kangaroo</b> carcass is cut into quarters for better handling and it is consequently cut into other specific portions. <b>Kangaroo</b> meat is also widely used in the kitchen; it can be prepared by boiling, baking, stewing, grilling and even smoking. <b>Kangaroo</b> meat is also used {{in a wide range}} of products, for example sausages, hamburgers or prosciutto. Besides meat, <b>kangaroo</b> skin is also used. The main microbiological hazards of <b>kangaroo</b> meat are pathogenic microorganisms, Escherichia coli and Salmonella ssp.

25|$|The <b>kangaroo</b> {{has always}} been a very {{important}} animal for Australian Aborigines, for its meat, hide, bone, and tendon. <b>Kangaroo</b> hides were also sometimes used for recreation; in particular there are accounts of some tribes (Kurnai) using stuffed <b>kangaroo</b> scrotum as a ball for the traditional football game of marngrook. In addition, there were important Dreaming stories and ceremonies involving the <b>kangaroo.</b> Aherrenge is a current <b>kangaroo</b> dreaming site in the Northern Territory.|$|R
