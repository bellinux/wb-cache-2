The number of hostages to be shot was calculated as a ratio of 100hostages <b>executed</b> <b>for</b> every German soldier killed and 50hostages <b>executed</b> <b>for</b> every German soldier wounded, a formula devised by Adolf Hitler with the intent of suppressing anti-Nazi resistance in Eastern Europe.|$|E
