50|$|Some of {{the basic}} {{benefits}} of active systems is that controls (usually electrical) {{can be used to}} maximize their effectiveness. For example, a passive solar thermal array which does not rely on pumps and sensors will only start circulating when a certain amount of internal energy has built up in the system. Using sensors and pumps, a relatively small amount of energy (i.e. that used to power a pump and controller) can harvest a far larger amount of available thermal energy by switching on as soon as a useful temperature differential becomes present. Controls also allow a greater variety of choices for utilizing the energy that becomes available. For example, a solar thermal array could heat a swimming pool on a relatively cool morning where heating a domestic <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>cylinder</b> was impractical due to the different stored water temperatures. Later in the day as the temperature rises the controls could be used to switch the solar heated water over to the cylinder instead.|$|E
5000|$|One {{reason for}} an {{efficiency}} drop {{is because the}} design and/or implementation of the heating system gives return water (heat transfer fluid) temperatures at the boiler of over 55°C (131°F), which prevents significant condensation in the heat exchanger. Better education of both installers and owners {{could be expected to}} raise efficiency towards the reported laboratory values. Natural Resources Canada also suggests ways to make better use of these boilers, such as combining space and water heating systems. Some boilers (e.g. Potterton) can be switched between two flow temperatures such as 63°C (145°F) and 84°C (183°F), only the former being [...] "fully condensing." [...] However, boilers are normally installed with higher flow temperature by default because a domestic <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>cylinder</b> is generally heated to 60°C (140°F), and this takes too long to achieve with a flow temperature only three degrees higher. Nevertheless, even partial condensing is more efficient than a traditional boiler.|$|E

50|$|Heating at {{this time}} was by means of {{coal-fired}} stoves. In large houses these would {{be placed in a}} basement, allowing thermosiphon circulation throughout the house. Nearly a century after Fowler, British practice for typical small houses in the post-World War I period developed the back boiler, where a living room fireplace would also have a simple tank boiler built into it. Large diameter pipes from this boiler circulated through a coil heat exchanger in an indirect <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> storage <b>cylinder</b> upstairs. This <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> supplied both bathroom, increasingly fitted upstairs in houses of this period, and the kitchen or scullery downstairs. The height difference between boiler and storage allowed thermosiphon circulation in this simple large bore primary circuit. By the 1960s, the space heating circulation system was assisted by an electric pump. Switching from coal heating to gas boilers also drove a switch to reliable pumped circulation in the 1970s. With the disappearance of stored <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> in favour of the combi boiler, from the 1980s onwards, the thermosiphon disappeared from British plumbing.|$|R
40|$|Globally, {{renewable}} generation is growing rapidly, {{and the next}} few decades are likely to see many consumers adopting new grid-connected technologies such as electric vehicles, photovoltaics and energy management systems. However, these 'greener' and smarter' changes could create significant challenges for power quality, safety and other aspects of grid management. We describe how New Zealand is an ideal research environment for combining smart grid capability with integration of high levels of renewables, as it already has around 80 % {{renewable generation}}, and advanced metering infrastructure in over 62 % of households. Challenges for achieving a greener, smarter grid identified in the GREEN Grid research programme include managing the increased variability in supply, especially from the growing use of wind and solar generation; the potential for power quality and congestion issues from high levels of small scale distributed generation; the need for increased frequency keeping and instantaneous reserves as variability increases; and the relatively low level of consumer engagement in demand response which could ideally assist with variability. In this paper we describe the methodology and approach used in the research programme, and note some initial findings that may help address these issues, including the benefits of geographically distributed wind farms to reduce overall wind variability; the development of a hosting capacity tool for small scale distributed generation; a proposal for new ancillary services to help manage (and cover the costs of) increased variability; and the increased use of <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>cylinders</b> for demand response.

To meet peak reduction targets set by the tool user, switching programs found via iterative optimizations are applied to hot water systems.|$|E
30|$|Default {{parameters}} and parameters entered {{by the user}} via the user input interface are represented by I/O 1. The hot water consumption generator receives I/O 1 and determines hot water consumption profiles for individual households; these profiles are represented by I/O 2. The <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>cylinder</b> model receives I/O 2 and calculates uncontrolled water heating loads and shower temperatures for the households; the results are represented by I/O 3. The user can observe the aggregate uncontrolled load curve of the households in the controlled area, and proceed with the optimization of switching programs. The switching program optimizer receives I/O 3 and produces switching programs based on the user-defined parameters (the desired peak reduction target, control periods etc.). The best switching programs are presented to the user, so that he/she can select the most suitable switching program. The <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>cylinder</b> model then calculates controlled water heating loads (I/O 5) by applying the user-selected switching program (I/O 4) to the hot water consumption profiles (I/O 2). The performance calculator receives I/O 5 and determines key performance indicators such as peak reductions and customer’s comfort.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research project {{is to improve the}} control and provide a more cost-efficient operation in the direct heating of stored domestic or industrial fluid mediums; such to be achieved by means of an intelligent automated energy management system. For the residential customer this system concept applies to the <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> supply as stored in the familiar <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> cylinder; for the industrial or commercial customer the scope is considerably greater with larger quantities and varieties of fluid mediums. Both areas can obtain significant financial savings with improved energy management. Both consumers and power supply and distribution companies will benefit with increased utilisation of cheaper 'off-peak' electricity; reducing costs and spreading the system load demand. The project has focussed on domestic energy management with a definite view to the wider field of industrial applications. Domestic energy control methodology and equipment has not significantly altered for decades. However, computer hardware and software has since then flourished to an unprecedented proportion and has become relatively cheap and versatile; these factors pave the way for the application of computer technology in this area of great potential. The technology allows the implementation of a 'hot water energy management system', which makes a forecast of the <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> demand for the next 24 hours and proceeds to provide this demand in the most efficient manner possible. In the (near) future, the system, known as FEMS for Fluid Energy Management System, is able to take advantage and in fact will promote the use of a retail 'dynamic spot price tariff’. FEMS is a combination of hardware and software developed to replace the existing cylinder thermostat, take care of the necessary data-acquisition and control the cylinder's total energy instead of it's (single point) temperature. This provides, besides heating cost reduction, a greater accuracy, a degree of flexibility, improved feedback, legionella inhibition, and a diagnostic capability. To the domestic consumer the latter three items are of greatest relevance. The crux of the system lies in its predictive ability. Having explored the more conventional alternatives, a suitable solution was found in the utilisation of the Elman recurrent neural networks, which focus on the temporal characteristics of the <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> demand time series and are able to adapt to changing environments, coping with the presence of any non-linearity and noise in the data. Prior to developing FEMS a study was made of the basic fluid behaviour in medium and high pressure domestic <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>cylinders,</b> an area not well-covered to date and of interest to engineers and manufacturers alike. For this step data acquisition equipment and software was purposely created. The control software plus equipment were combined into a fully automated test system with minimal operator input, allowing a large amount of data to be gathered over a period measured in months. A similar system was subsequently used to collect actual <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> demand data from a residential family, and in fact forms the basis for FEMS. Finally an enhanced version of FEMS is discussed and it is shown how the system is able to output multiple prediction and utilise varying tariff rates...|$|R

30|$|The tool {{employs a}} Monte Carlo {{approach}} to generate hot water consumption profiles for each household. First, the tool generates random values to determine specific parameters {{for a single}} household: family type, when showers are taken (morning, or evening, or morning and evening), number of showers, number of low volume usages, length of each shower and each gap between consecutive showers, starting time for each shower and each low volume usage. Next, using these parameters, the tool generates a 24 -hour hot water consumption profile for a single household. The tool then repeats the profile generation process for a specified number of households using {{a new set of}} random values each time. Finally, the whole process is repeated for the required number of Monte Carlo iterations.

The system is modelled and simulated with TRNSYS program for Bamako, Mali and the results show that 6, 648 MJ of energy can be provided per year and the solar contribution is 0. 96, i. e., 96 % of the needs for hot water for a 4 - 6 persons family are satisfied with solar energy. The financial characteristics of the system investigated give positive and very promising figures. By considering a rate for electricity equal to 0. 16 US$/kWh, the pay back time is 2 years and the life cycle savings, representing the money saved because of the use of the system throughout its life (20 years) instead of using conventional energy (electricity), is US $ 2, 200. With respect to the life cycle assessment, the pollution created for the production of the system is estimated by calculating the embodied energy invested in the manufacture, assembly and installation of the collectors {{and other parts of the}} system. For the present thermosyphon system the embodied energy is found to be equal to 4, 283 MJ.
