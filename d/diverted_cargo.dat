40|$|This article aims {{to analyze}} the {{potential}} of Iranian ports for carrying some containerized cargo, from the Far East to the European Union, which is usually transported via traditional shipping routes. The idea of <b>diverting</b> <b>cargo</b> via an “Iran route ” emerged from an examination of economic, trade and maritime transportation trends and events. This study presents a new idea for a freight route, designed in four segments {{for the benefit of}} the carrier. In order to make assumptions about the future in what are undisputedly widespread uncertain conditions, a scenario method has been employed. Following this a plausible future plan for a new terminal has been developed taking into account geographical, technical and economic themes for serving the container transit market until 2011...|$|R
40|$|The {{heat shock}} protein 90 (Hsp 90) {{inhibitor}} geldanamycin (GA) {{has been shown to}} alter endosomal sorting, <b>diverting</b> <b>cargo</b> destined for the recycling pathway into the lysosomal pathway. Here we investigated whether GA also affects the sorting of cargo into the retrograde pathway from endosomes to the Golgi apparatus. As a model cargo we used the bacterial toxin Shiga toxin, which exploits the retrograde pathway as an entry route to the cytosol. Indeed, GA treatment of HEp- 2 cells strongly increased the Shiga toxin transport to the Golgi apparatus. The enhanced Golgi transport was not due to increased endocytic uptake of the toxin or perturbed recycling, suggesting that GA selectively enhances endosomal sorting into the retrograde pathway. Moreover, GA activated p 38 and both inhibitors of p 38 or its substrate MK 2 partially counteracted the GA-induced increase in Shiga toxin transport. Thus, our data suggest that GA-induced p 38 and MK 2 activation participate in the increased Shiga toxin transport to the Golgi apparatus...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} a simulation model {{to evaluate the}} disruptions, delays, and incremental costs inflicted on the U. S. West Coast container shipping industry by a Transportation Security Incident (TSI). Each year, more than 6, 000 container ships call upon West Coast seaports handling in excess of 18. 3 million containers. Current national directives do not specify uniform standards for measuring the amount of seaport cargohandling capacity, nor decision rules to <b>divert</b> <b>cargo</b> to alternate facilities when a primary destination is degraded or unusable. Through analysis, we identify infrastructure components that are potential bottlenecks and/or vulnerable to a TSI that can potentially threaten the U. S. maritime shipping capacity. For example, we demonstrate a 10 -day labor union dispute and longshoremen work stoppage that paralyzes the entire U. S. West Coast. The incident induces significant port congestion from Puget Sound to San Pedro Bay, reducing the annual West Coast vessel and import container throughput by 3 percent 174 vessels and 237, 088 containers), and increases the incremental costs suffered by ocean carriers by $ 400 million. Additional analysis identifies opportunities for commercial and government investment in additional seaport infrastructure to alleviate West Coast port congestion, while ensuring the unimpeded continuity of operations of West Coast shipping subsequent to a TSI.

40|$|Myosin V motors are {{believed}} to contribute to cell polarization by carrying cargoes along actin tracks. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Myosin Vs transport secretory vesicles along actin cables, which are dynamic actin bundles assembled by the formin For 3 at cell poles. How these flexible structures are able to extend longitudinally in the cell through the dense cytoplasm is unknown. Here we show that in myosin V (myo 52 myo 51) null cells, actin cables are curled, bundled, and fail to extend into the cell interior. They also exhibit reduced retrograde flow, suggesting that formin-mediated actin assembly is impaired. Myo 52 may contribute to actin cable organization by delivering actin regulators to cell poles, as myoV defects are partially suppressed by <b>diverting</b> <b>cargoes</b> toward cell tips onto microtubules with a kinesin 7 -Myo 52 tail chimera. In addition, Myo 52 motor activity may pull on cables to provide the tension necessary for their extension and efficient assembly, as artificially tethering actin cables to the nuclear envelope via a Myo 52 motor domain restores actin cable extension and retrograde flow in myoV mutants. Together these in vivo data reveal elements of a self-organizing {{system in which the}} motors shape their own tracks by transporting cargoes and exerting physical pulling forces...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{examine the}} {{economic}} and strategic implications for gas supply security and diversity of Europe's reliance on global LNG markets. In particular, we carry out a detailed assessment of LNG trade between Atlantic and Pacific basins in 2011 - 2014, focusing on why there was not as much LNG arbitrage as {{might have been expected}} given the large price differential between these two regions in that period. By explicitly modelling a counterfactual scenario, in which LNG can be diverted to follow price differentials between Europe and Asia, we found that: (a) it is not the demand shock in Asia (driven by the Fukushima incident) per se but the high oil price in that period, as well as decoupling of European spot prices from oil-linked contract prices that created the huge natural gas price differentials between Asia and Europe; (b) amongst the largest LNG suppliers who could arbitrage between the Atlantic and Pacific regions, Qatar would have received the highest net benefit from <b>diverting</b> <b>cargoes</b> to Asia, however, these benefits are highly sensitive to the possibility of contract price renegotiations with Asian buyers (similar to what happened to large pipeline gas suppliers in Europe in the recent past); (c) furthermore, diverting contractual volumes from Europe to Asia would have required lengthy negotiations with European buyers who, as our modelling results suggest, did not necessarily have compelling commercial interests in sending contractual cargoes to Asia after taking into account that the surplus of LNG created in North-West Europe allowed these buyers to reduce high oil-linked contract prices with traditional pipeline suppliers. Thus, contrary to the currently prevailing view that European importers have largely 'overinvested' in LNG import capacity, these investments should be seen as a strategic bargaining option that European importers have developed to counterbalance the otherwise potentially larger pricing power of pipeline suppliers. Thus, investment in LNG import capacity reduces the need to invest in 'strategic and special relationship' with traditional suppliers to ensure against 'unfair' pricing practices...|$|R

40|$|International audienceHuntington's disease (HD) is a fatal {{neurodegenerative}} disorder {{caused by}} expansion of a polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin protein (htt) that mediates formation of intracellular protein aggregates. In {{the brains of}} HD patients and HD transgenic mice, accumulation of protein aggregates has been causally linked to lesions in axo-dendritic and synaptic compartments. Here we show that dendritic spines - sites of synaptogenesis - are lost in the proximity of htt aggregates because of functional defects in local endosomal recycling mediated by the Rab 11 protein. Impaired exit from recycling endosomes and association of endocytosed protein with intracellular structures containing htt aggregates was demonstrated in cultured hippocampal neurons cells expressing a mutant htt fragment. Dendrites in hippocampal neurons became dystrophic around enlarged amphisome-like structures positive for Rab 11, LC 3 and mutant htt aggregates. Futhermore, Rab 11 overexpression rescues neurodegeneration and dramatically extends lifespan in a Drosophila model of HD. Our {{findings are consistent with}} the model that mutant htt aggregation increases local autophagic activity, thereby sequestering Rab 11 and <b>diverting</b> spine-forming <b>cargo</b> from recycling endosomes into enlarged amphisomes. This mechanism may contribute to the toxicity caused by protein misfolding found in a number of neurodegenerative diseases...|$|R
50|$|There {{were two}} Cabinets on Friday 2 November.

40|$|DNGR- 1 (CLEC 9 A) is a {{receptor}} for necrotic cells {{required by}} DCs to cross-prime CTLs against dead cell antigens in mice. It is currently unknown how DNGR- 1 couples dead cell recognition to cross-priming. Here {{we found that}} DNGR- 1 did not mediate DC activation by dead cells but rather <b>diverted</b> necrotic cell <b>cargo</b> into a recycling endosomal compartment, favoring cross-presentation to CD 8 (+) T cells. DNGR- 1 regulated cross-priming in non-infectious settings such as immunization with antigen-bearing dead cells, {{as well as in}} highly immunogenic situations such as infection with herpes simplex virus type 1. Together, these results suggest that DNGR- 1 is a dedicated receptor for cross-presentation of cell-associated antigens. Our work thus underscores the importance of cross-priming in immunity and indicates that antigenicity and adjuvanticity can be decoded by distinct innate immune receptors. The identification of specialized receptors that regulate antigenicity of virus-infected cells reveals determinants of antiviral immunity that might underlie the human response to infection and vaccination.

40|$|ABSTRACT Cell {{types that}} {{generate}} unique lysosome-related organelles (LROs), such as mel-anosomes in melanocytes, populate nascent LROs with <b>cargoes</b> that are <b>diverted</b> from endo-somes. <b>Cargo</b> sorting toward melanosomes correlates with binding via cytoplasmically ex-posed sorting signals to either heterotetrameric adaptor AP- 1 or AP- 3. Some cargoes bind both adaptors, but the relative contribution of each adaptor to cargo recognition and their functional interactions with other effectors during transport to melanosomes are not clear. Here we exploit targeted mutagenesis of the acidic dileucine–based sorting signal in the pig-ment cell–specific protein OCA 2 to dissect the relative roles of AP- 1 and AP- 3 in transport to melanosomes. We show that binding to AP- 1 or AP- 3 {{depends on the}} primary sequence of the signal and not its position within the cytoplasmic domain. Mutants that preferentially bound either AP- 1 or AP- 3 each trafficked toward melanosomes and functionally comple-mented OCA 2 deficiency, but AP- 3 binding was necessary for steady-state melanosome lo-calization. Unlike tyrosinase, which also engages AP- 3 for optimal melanosomal delivery, both AP- 1 – and AP- 3 –favoring OCA 2 variants required BLOC- 1 for melanosomal transport. These data provide evidence for distinct roles of AP- 1 and AP- 3 in OCA 2 transport to melanosome...|$|R
40|$|The United States {{has been}} {{historically}} at the “end of the pipeline” for {{liquefied natural gas}} (LNG) and regular imports are needed in some regions to augment seasonal shortages in supply. Because the United States has become a more significant producer of natural gas (highest in the world), regional markets here tend to no longer rely on LNG cargoes for gas supply. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), “LNG imports to the United States were generally not viewed as competitive with domestic supplies of natural gas and pipeline imports from Canada through the 1980 s and 1990 s. ” In the early 2000 s, however, domestic gas production began to decline— precipitating a rise in gas prices that made foreign LNG import (then still reliant on young, expensive technologies) affordable wholesale. In order to facilitate the utilization of an inexpensive new fuel option, Congress amended the Deepwater Port Act (DWPA) to cover LNG import facilities. The DWPA, until then, had been a largely unused law, allowing for the licensing of ports located on the U. S. ’s outer continental shelf where oil cargoes could be offloaded and funneled through pipelines to mainland refineries. In the 2002 amended DWPA, the joint-jurisdiction of the U. S. Coast Guard (USCG) and the Department of Transportation’s sub-agency, the Maritime Administration (MARAD), was extended beyond deepwater oil ports to include LNG port applications, licensing, construction, operation, and decommissioning {{by virtue of the}} act’s extension to natural gas. Approval of onshore pipeline interconnections remained in the purview of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and commodity import/export approval remained with the Department of Energy. Along with a push to build deepwater LNG ports, interest in onshore LNG terminal construction and re-commissioning was also renewed. Unfortunately, once deepwater LNG ports started coming online (beginning with the Gulf Gateway in the Gulf of Mexico), LNG imports almost immediately began to become unprofitable and unpredictable. There were “substantial changes in year-over-year imports as a result of suppliers’ decisions to either bring spare cargos to the United States or to <b>divert</b> <b>cargos</b> to countries where prices may be higher. ” In New England, a dearth of pipeline capacity acted as a bottleneck for interstate gas transmission, so the installation of three LNG import facilities—two offshore “deepwater ports” and one onshore terminal—remained economically viable. Because that region’s gas prices are closer to the global market prices, LNG cargoes frequent those deepwater ports more than in the Gulf of Mexico. LNG remains an expensive, foreign, spot-market-purchase commodity. Regardless of whether a region had the capacity to import LNG cargoes, abundant domestic supplies have made it too economically burdensome to purchase gas from foreign nations for consumer, residential, and industrial uses. In 2009, U. S. import capacity was only operating at eleven percent—meaning there could be a nine-fold increase in LNG cargoes to the United States before space would be limited. In 2010, that number dropped to six percent. With recent increases in domestic production from shale and conventional sources, “[n]atural gas prices have declined and imports of LNG have significantly declined. ” Nonetheless, the DWPA accomplished its goal. There are three deepwater LNG ports in operation today, albeit at low capacities, another three approved but not yet under construction, and a handful more in the application stage (or with pending and proposed applications). Given the lack of a significant domestic market for imported LNG, the overcapacity of existing ports and land-based terminals, and an evolving natural gas outlook, the DWPA may not be invoked for another LNG port for a long while, but we still have active applications with significant safety and environmental concerns and a growing LNG exports market. In this article, Part I is a short introduction to LNG, Part II is a walkthrough of the most significant aspects of the DWPA and deepwater port management, Part III is a discussion of the public safety, environmental, and climate concerns arising from LNG trade, and Part IV is a discussion of the current LNG domestic marketplace and trends for the near-term future...|$|R
