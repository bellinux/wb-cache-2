6000|$|I glanced {{through the}} little note. He was right. The {{conventional}} <b>hearts</b> <b>and</b> <b>darts</b> epistle. It sounded nice enough: [...] "Longing {{to see you}} again; so lonely in this place; your dear sweet letter; {{looking forward to the}} time; your ever-devoted Sissie." ...|$|R

6000|$|The {{imagination}} is alternately a cheat and a dupe; nay, more, {{it is the}} most subtle of cheats, for it cheats itself and becomes the dupe of its own delusions. It conjures up [...] "airy nothings," [...] gives to them a [...] "local habitation and a name," [...] and then bows to their control as implicitly as though they were realities. Such was now my case. The good Numa could not more thoroughly have persuaded himself that the nymph Egeria hovered about her sacred fountain and communed with him in spirit than I had deceived myself into a kind of visionary intercourse with the airy phantom fabricated in my brain. I constructed a rustic seat {{at the foot of the}} tree where I had discovered the footsteps. I made a kind of bower there, where I used to pass my mornings reading poetry and romances. I carved <b>hearts</b> <b>and</b> <b>darts</b> on the tree, and hung it with garlands. My heart was full to overflowing, and wanted some faithful bosom into which it might relieve itself. What is a lover without a confidante? I thought at once of my sister Sophy, my early playmate, the sister of my affections. She was so reasonable, too, and of such correct feelings, always listening to my words as oracular sayings, and admiring my scraps of poetry as the very inspirations of the muse. From such a devoted, such a rational being, what secrets could I have? ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{common name}} of this species refers to the {{supposed}} shapes of the bold dark stigmata on the usually pale forewings. In this species all the stigmata have a rounded shape, contrasting with the elongated claviform stigmata of the much commoner <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> <b>dart.</b> The hindwings are grey, usually much darker than in <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> <b>dart</b> and turnip moth. The wingspan is 35-40 mm. The moth flies at night in June and July [...] and is attracted to light and sugar.|$|E
50|$|The <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> <b>dart</b> (Agrotis exclamationis) is a moth of {{the family}} Noctuidae. A {{familiar}} moth to many, it {{is considered one of}} the most common of the European region. It occurs throughout the Palearctic ecozone from Ireland to Japan.|$|E
50|$|Chickweeds {{are used}} as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species {{including}} Angle Shades, <b>Heart</b> <b>and</b> <b>Dart,</b> Riband Wave, Setaceous Hebrew Character and the Coleophora case-bearers C. coenosipennella (feeds exclusively on Stellaria spp), C. lineolea (recorded on S. graminea), C. lithargyrinella (recorded on S. holostea), C. solitariella (feeds exclusively on S. holostea) and C. striatipennella.|$|E
40|$|Metal {{complexes}} of Fe(III) such as Fe(III) {{ethylene diamine}} tetraacetic acid (FeETDA) {{have been observed}} to be effective molluscicides. The mechanism of toxicity of FeEDTA complex on molluscs is not clear {{and it is also}} not known if Fe(III) in the form FeEDTA is absorbed more effectively by snails than simple iron salts. Snails were fed with molluscicide pellets containing the FeEDTA complex and also with pellets containing FePO 4 after 3 - 4 days the <b>hearts,</b> kidneys <b>and</b> <b>dart</b> sacs removed <b>and</b> analysed for Fe(III) content. Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) coupled with Fourier transform electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (FT-ESIMS) was used to analyse the sample extracts. The method had a very wide linear range from 2 to 10, 000 ng mL− 1, intra- and inter-day precisions of ca. ± 0. 5 % were observed for the analysis of extracts from snail tissues spiked with Fe(III). The limit of detection was of 0. 5 ng mL− 1 for a 20 μL injection. The levels of Fe(III) in tissues from snails fed Fe EDTA pellets were 10 - 100 times higher than the levels in snails fed FePO 4 pellets. The analysis of Cu, Zn, Ca and Mn could also be carried out using the same analytical procedure...|$|R
60|$|Lastly {{there was}} this high-born lady, Blanche Aleys, with whom fortune had thrown me so strangely that day. Those blue eyes of hers had pierced my <b>heart</b> like <b>darts,</b> <b>and</b> do what I would I might not rid my mind of the thought of her, or my ears of {{the sound of her}} soft voice, while her kisses seemed still to burn upon my lips. It wrung me to think that perhaps I should never see her again, or that if I did I might not speak with her, being so far beneath her in condition, and having already earned the wrath of her father, and, as I guessed, the jealousy of that scented cousin of hers whom they said the King loved like a brother.|$|R
40|$|The {{innovative}} strategy for a flat patternmaking course was to incorporate a Gallery Walk {{for students to}} practice applying their knowledge of <b>darts</b> <b>and</b> <b>dart</b> equivalents as an in-class exercise. The purpose in introducing the Gallery Walk in the flat patternmaking class was to engage students in critical thinking <b>and</b> problem-solving about <b>darts</b> <b>and</b> <b>dart</b> manipulations. This Gallery Walk displayed pictures of <b>darts</b> <b>and</b> <b>dart</b> equivalents for students to identify. This allowed student to analyze the similarities <b>and</b> differences of <b>darts</b> <b>and</b> <b>dart</b> equivalents <b>and</b> determine the correct placement of the pictures within the gallery. The findings revealed the Gallery Walk helped students 2 ̆ 2 better define <b>darts</b> <b>and</b> <b>dart</b> equivalents, recognize variations when using dart equivalents in garment designs,and ways to utilize dart equivalents in my original designs. 2 ̆...|$|R
