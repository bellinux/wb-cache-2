5|$|Yet Brooks did {{not always}} ennoble her subjects. Inherited wealth freed her from the need to sell her paintings; she did not care whether she pleased her sitters or not, and her wit, when unleashed, could be devastating. A {{striking}} example is her 1914–15 portrait of Elsie de Wolfe, an <b>interior</b> <b>designer</b> whom she felt had copied her monochromatic color schemes. Brooks painted de Wolfe porcelain-pale, in an off-white dress and a bonnet resembling a shower cap; a white ceramic goat placed on a table at her elbow seems to mimic her simpering expression.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reflects}} on research {{conducted on the}} role of <b>interior</b> <b>designers</b> in retail design within the South African retail sector. Based on three leading corporate retailers, the paper explores the contribution of <b>interior</b> <b>designers</b> to retail design in the South African clothing and footwear retail context. In 2008 these retail companies collectively held more than 50 per cent of a R 96. 2 billion retail market share. Their primary turnover is generated through consumer purchases concluded in retail stores. The design of retail stores have become a means of marketing communication and are commonly used as a differentiation strategy by retailers. It is here that <b>interior</b> <b>designers</b> can make a considerable contribution to retailers. This qualitative research study {{reflects on}} information obtained through open-ended interviews with the managers and senior managers involved in the design and implementation of retail stores for these leading clothing and footwear retailers. A qualitative content analysis method was employed to identify overlapping themes and categories to compare the role of <b>interior</b> <b>designers</b> in these three corporate retailers. The research reveals that <b>interior</b> <b>designers</b> are currently under utilised due to a poor understanding of the role that <b>interior</b> <b>designers</b> can perform in retail design. Although the paper provides information on the approach and operation of retail design in the clothing and footwear sphere of retailing, wider application can be drawn to the role of <b>interior</b> <b>designers</b> in retail design in South Africa. The paper proposes that stakeholders such as education could make a valuable contribution in promoting interior design in all sectors within the South African economy...|$|R
