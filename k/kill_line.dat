50|$|With {{the advent}} of smaller higher {{performance}} canopies, the drag induced by trailing a pilot chute behind a canopy has become a significant concern. To reduce this drag some pilot chute designs of the Pull-out and Throw-out variety are collapsible. Once deployment of the parachute has occurred a <b>kill</b> <b>line</b> running up {{the center of the}} pilot chute bridle becomes loaded. This <b>kill</b> <b>line</b> pulls down on the apex of the pilot chute collapsing it and greatly reducing its drag on the canopy.|$|E

50|$|Only the hand-deployed {{pilot chute}} may be {{collapsed}} automatically after deployment—by a <b>kill</b> <b>line</b> reducing the in-flight drag {{of the pilot}} chute on the main canopy. Reserves, on the other hand, do not retain their pilot chutes after deployment. The reserve deployment bag and pilot chute are not connected to the canopy in a reserve system. This {{is known as a}} free-bag configuration, and the components are sometimes not recovered after a reserve deployment.|$|E
50|$|Some designs {{replace the}} <b>kill</b> <b>line</b> with a fixed length of shock cord, which {{stretches}} when the pilot chute is moving quickly, {{allowing it to}} inflate. When the pilot slows down (after opening a canopy, for example) the shock cord retracts, killing the pilot chute. While this avoids the possibility of pilot-in-tow malfunction due to an un-cocked pilot, it has the disadvantage of requiring significant airspeed to operate. This could cause a delayed deployment if used for a BASE or balloon jump, or any other jump with a low speed deployment. This type may also begin to re-inflate behind a highly loaded, fast moving canopy, negating the usefulness of a collapsible pilot chute.|$|E

5000|$|... 3. Cementing inadequate. Cementing {{proceeded}} a) without flushing the annulus {{around the}} shoe track at sufficiently high rate and duration to ensure full circumferential removal of compressed sediment and good distribution of cement, and b) without converting the float collar to activate its two check valves to prevent cement backflow. Cement quality and strength {{may have been}} reduced by contamination on its way down the casing, or by mixing with lower density mud in the rathole. There was no cementing evaluation log at Macondo, which may have shown it to be inadequate. 4. Pressure test wrongly interpreted. Drill pipe was run to 8,367 ft ready for mud displacement. During the [...] "negative pressure test", for {{which there was no}} detailed procedure, no flow from the <b>kill</b> <b>line</b> was accepted and 1,400 psi on the drill pipe was ignored.|$|E
50|$|This {{happens with}} the popular {{throw-out}} deployment system where the pilot chute does not pull the pin and open the container or once opened does not exert enough force to extract the deployment bag from the container. It {{can be caused by}} pilot chutes with kill lines that have not been cocked during packing or where the <b>kill</b> <b>line</b> has shrunk through use and reduces the drag of the pilot chute. It can be caused by a mis-routed pilot chute bridle. It can also be caused by too large a deployment bag and canopy for the container, although deployment bags should be matched to the containers. The correct procedure with this malfunction is to deploy the reserve from a stable belly down position. If time permits, the skydiver might first attempt to bump their container to dislodge a trapped deployment bag. If this malfunction is temporary and clears, it is called a pilot chute hesitation.|$|E
5000|$|When a kick (influx of {{formation}} fluid) occurs, rig operators or automatic systems {{close the}} blowout preventer units, sealing the annulus {{to stop the}} flow of fluids out of the wellbore. Denser mud is then circulated into the wellbore down the drill string, up the annulus and out through the choke line {{at the base of the}} BOP stack through chokes (flow restrictors) until downhole pressure is overcome. Once “kill weight” mud extends from the bottom of the well to the top, the well has been “killed”. If the integrity of the well is intact drilling may be resumed. Alternatively, if circulation is not feasible it may be possible to kill the well by [...] "bullheading", forcibly pumping, in the heavier mud from the top through the <b>kill</b> <b>line</b> connection at the base of the stack. This is less desirable because of the higher surface pressures likely needed and the fact that much of the mud originally in the annulus must be forced into receptive formations in the open hole section beneath the deepest casing shoe.|$|E

An online line‐scan {{imaging system}} {{containing}} an electron‐multiplying charge‐coupled device detector and line‐ scan spectrograph {{was used for}} identifying wholesome and unwholesome freshly slaughtered chicken carcasses on high‐speed commercial chicken processing lines. Hyperspectral images were acquired using the line‐scan imaging system for 5549 wholesome chicken carcasses and 93 unwholesome chicken carcasses on a commercial processing line, for analysis to optimize ROI size and location and to determine the key intensity waveband and ratio wavebands {{to be used for}} online inspection. Multispectral imaging algorithms were developed for real‐time online identification of wholesome and unwholesome chicken carcasses. The imaging system inspected over 100, 000 chickens on a commercial 140 ‐bpm <b>kill</b> <b>line</b> during continuous operation and achieved over 99 % accuracy in identifying wholesome chickens and over 96 % accuracy in identifying unwholesome chickens. A system of this type can perform food safety inspection tasks accurately and with less variation in performance at high speeds (e. g., at least 140 bpm), and help poultry plants to improve production efficiency and satisfy increasing consumer demand for poultry products...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. An {{automated}} poultry carcass {{inspection system}} {{will help the}} poultry processing industry to provide better chicken products for the consumer while minimizing potential economic losses. The objective {{of this research was}} to investigate the potential of a color-based sensing technique suitable for rapid automated inspection for wholesomeness of chickens in the visible region. Spectra, in the range of 400 to 867 nm, of veterinarian-selected carcasses, 400 wholesome and 332 unwholesome, were collected from a high-speed <b>kill</b> <b>line</b> using a visible/near-infrared spectrophotometer system. CIELUV color differences characterizing wholesome and unwholesome chicken samples were calculated as a simple distance formula and used to classify individual samples. Results showed that the greatest color differences occurred for waveband combinations at (508 nm, 426 nm), (560 nm, 426 nm), and (640 nm, 420 nm). Full-spectrum classification achieved accuracies of 85 %, 86 %, 84 %, and 82 % for wholesome validation samples, wholesome testing samples, unwholesome validation samples, and unwholesome testing samples, respectively. Using the (560 nm, 426 nm) waveband combination, classification accuracies of 91 %, 92 %, 90 %, and 90 % were achieved for wholesome validation samples, wholesome testing samples, unwholesome validation samples, and unwholesome testing samples, respectively. The potential of using CIELUV color differences to differentiate between wholesome and unwholesome chickens was demonstrated, and the straightforward calculation involved suggest that the method is suitable for rapid automated online sorting of chicken carcasses...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. With the depleting reservoirs on land and increasing demand for hydrocarbons, the exploration for reservoirs has been moving to deeper and deeper water. The current technology has reached its limit in water depth, and new technology needs to be introduced if exploration is to be continued into even deeper water. One proposed method is subsea mudlift drilling (SMD), which is a joint industry project. The method uses a seafloor pump, which pumps the mud from the annulus at seafloor, through a separate small diameter pipe, such as the choke and <b>kill</b> <b>line,</b> to the rig floor. Because of the expected problems with u-tubing, a drillstring valve (DSV) has been developed to be installed in the drillstring. With new drilling technology comes new well control procedures. The toolkit is a well control tool that is used for almost any well control situation that may arise. The purpose of the research at hand was to develop and present a toolkit for subsea mudlift drilling on the basis of conventional toolkits. The DSV had not previously been modeled, and its response to changes in mudweight, flowrate, water depth etc. has been unknown to this point in time. The toolkit includes a model for the DSV, which can generate plots of pressure drop over the DSV for any changes. The results were examined for several cases, and the pressure response and characteristics of the DSV were mapped. The optimum location for the DSV in the drillpipe also was investigated. It was found that if the DSV were located just above the blow out preventer (BOP), the pressure differential over the DSV would be maximized. Maximizing the pressure difference over and under the flowcone on the DSV will result in a larger opening in the DSV, and thus less pressure will be lost through the DSV choke. If logging tools are to be run in the drillstring, the DSV must be placed {{in the bottom of the}} drillstring, near the bit. It is also recommended that all measurement while drilling (MWD) tools be installed between the bit and the DSV, as this will also increase the pressure differential over the DSV flowcone. During conventional drilling a straight-line approximation is often used to predict the drillpipe pressure-decline schedule. This research also established that for low flowrates, with no geometric well deviation, such a method might also be used for SMD. However, using a well control method as that is tailored for subsea mudlift drilling, the flowrate will be relatively high and the straight-line approximation will not be valid. In the case of high flowrates and a deviated well, the drillpipe pressure-decline schedule should always be calculated using the toolkit...|$|E
