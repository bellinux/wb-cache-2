5000|$|Tandy offered 2 color {{monitors}} specific for its Tandy 1000 computers. The budget {{model was}} the Tandy CM-5, {{which had a}} large <b>dot</b> <b>pitch</b> of 0.64 millimeters.

Both supported Tandy 320 by 200 16 color graphics. The more expensive CM-11 also supported the higher resolution 640 by 200 and a special proprietary Tandy enhanced 225 scan line for text display for clearer text. Normal CGA has only 200 scan lines.

50|$|The <b>dot</b> <b>pitch</b> of a {{computer}} display determines the absolute limit of possible pixel density.Typical circa-2000 cathode ray tube or LCD computer displays range from 67 to 130 PPI, though desktop monitors have exceeded 200 PPI and contemporary small-screen mobile devices often exceed 300 PPI, sometimes by a wide margin.|$|R
50|$|The exact {{difference}} between horizontal and diagonal <b>dot</b> <b>pitch</b> {{varies with the}} design of the monitor (see pixel geometry and widescreen), but a typical entry-level 0.28 mm (diagonal) monitor has a horizontal pitch of 0.24 or 0.25 mm, a good quality 0.26 mm (diagonal) unit has a horizontal pitch of 0.22 mm.|$|R

50|$|The above <b>dot</b> <b>pitch</b> {{measurement}} {{does not}} apply to aperture grille displays. Such monitors use continuous vertical phosphor bands on the screen, so the vertical distance between scan lines is limited only by video input signal's vertical resolution and the thickness of electron beam, so there is no vertical 'dot pitch' on such devices. Aperture grille only has horizontal 'dot pitch', or otherwise known as 'stripe pitch'.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Dot</b> <b>pitch</b> (sometimes called line pitch, stripe pitch, or {{phosphor}} pitch) is a specification for {{a computer}} display, computer printer, image scanner, or other pixel-based device that describes the distance, for example, between dots (sub-pixels) on a display screen.

50|$|Text {{quality was}} a {{recurring}} issue with dot-matrix printers. Near Letter Quality mode - informally specified as almost {{good enough to}} be used in a business letter - endowed dot-matrix printers with a simulated typewriter-like quality. By using multiple passes of the carriage, and higher dot density, the printer could increase the effective resolution. For example, the Epson FX-86 could achieve a theoretical addressable dot-grid of 240 by 216 dots/inch using a print head with a vertical dot density of only 72 dots/inch, by making multiple passes of the print head for each line. For 240 by 144 dots/inch, the print head would make one pass, printing 240 by 72 dots/inch, then the printer would advance the paper by half of the vertical <b>dot</b> <b>pitch</b> (1/144 inch), then the print head would make a second pass. For 240 by 216 dots/inch, the print head would make three passes with smaller paper movement (1/3 vertical <b>dot</b> <b>pitch,</b> or 1/216 inch) between the passes. To cut hardware costs, some manufacturers merely used a double strike (doubly printing each line) to increase the printed text's boldness, resulting in bolder but still jagged text. In all cases, NLQ mode incurred a severe speed penalty. Not surprisingly, all printers retained one or more 'draft' modes for high-speed printing.|$|R
5000|$|Spatial performance: For a {{computer}} monitor {{or some other}} display that is being viewed from a very close distance, resolution is often {{expressed in terms of}} <b>dot</b> <b>pitch</b> or pixels per inch, which is consistent with the printing industry. Display density varies per application, with televisions generally having a low density for long-distance viewing and portable devices having a high density for close-range detail. The Viewing Angle of an LCD may be important depending on the display and its usage, the limitations of certain display technologies mean the display only displays accurately at certain angles.|$|R
5000|$|Dot pitch: This is {{the size}} of an {{individual}} pixel, which includes the length of the subpixels and distances between subpixels. It can be measured as the horizontal or diagonal length of a pixel. A smaller <b>dot</b> <b>pitch</b> generally results in sharper images because there are more pixels in a given area. In the case of CRT based displays, pixels are not equivalent to the phosphor dots, as they are to the pixel triads in LC displays. Projection displays that use three monochrome CRTs do not have a dot structure, so this specification does not apply.|$|R

More of a desktop than laptop, it had a {{built-in}} high-resolution, active-matrix, 1-bit black & white, 9.8" [...] LCD with 640x400 resolution. Like the IIc Flat Panel, it was not backlit and required a bright light source to be used. A second generation model rectified that situation. Commencing with the PowerBook series, built-in LCD flat-panels became standard across the portable line, following an industry-wide evolution from grayscale to color and ranging from 9" [...] to 17". Two primary technologies were used, active matrix (higher quality and more expensive) and passive matrix displays (lower quality and cheaper). By 1998 all laptops would use the standard active-matrix color LCD with a standard average dimension of 13", except for the Newton products and eMate portables.

40|$|The visual grammar poster was {{designed}} and produced {{at the invitation of}} Modern Theory in 2012 as part of an international show of work from 20 design groups. The Visual Grammar show took place at MAD Brussels in September 2012. A specific briefing was provided and a fixed body of text was supplied to all participants who were asked to visually describe or define 'visual grammar' {{in the form of a}} poster. We took advantage of the project to prototype two new typeface designs. The intention for the poster was to use only the text provided in a way that distilled the words to visual forms without linguistic content. It was anticipated that separating form from meaning would speak about visual grammar in a direct and immediate way. Having undertaken a design development process involving around 50 alternative iterations, the final poster is a completely typeset composition where the boundary between what can and what can't be read is blurred. The body text is set in a single weight and size of ThreeTwo 00, an extensive modular type system which is currently in development. Here, letterforms are composed from dot grids at fixed increments.

40|$|Surface {{patterning}} {{with different}} biological molecules {{is one of}} the critical steps in the complex procedure of combinatorial biochemical analysis used e. g. in proteomics or in diagnostics. High-density bioarrays can reduce the analysis time. The tiny <b>dot</b> <b>pitches</b> allow to diminish the array size and so the diffusion time, or to place more targets onto one surface. One approach to dispensing such high-density arrays is to use the sharp tip of an atomic force microscope (AFM) probe like a fountain pen, which, when combined with the nanometric resolution of the AFM scanner, permits the deposition of small droplets with a high positioning accuracy [1]. A commercially available AFM probe made of silicon nitride consists of a flexible cantilever with a downwards-pointing hollow pyramidal tip at its free end. This probe can be modified with a FIB. Firstly an aperture is milled at the apex of the tip to permit the transfer of liquid from the probe to the sample (Fig. 1). The diameter of such apertures can be as small as 200 nm. Secondly, the reflective gold layer covering {{the upper part of the}} cantilever is removed locally, in and around the hollow tip. The gold layer can be made hydrophobic by chemical treatment, while the bare cantilever remains hydrophilic. This hydrophilic area acts as...|$|R
