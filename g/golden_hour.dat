5|$|In {{addition}} to appearing as the small {{figure of a}} woman in A <b>Golden</b> <b>Hour,</b> Deborah Vernon Hackett was also the subject of a portrait, painted around 1908, again during Fuller's time in Perth. Anne Gray, the head of Australian art at the National Gallery of Australia, observed of Fuller's approach to the newspaperman's wife, that:Fuller portrayed her sitter sympathetically, capturing the young woman's grace and charm. But she also conveyed the complexity of the young Mrs Hackett's character through her soft, feminine, pale-blue dress counterpoised by the dramatic black hat and direct gaze.|$|E

500|$|In 1904, Fuller {{returned}} to Australia, living in Perth. She became {{active in the}} Theosophical Society and painted some of her best-known work, including A <b>Golden</b> <b>Hour,</b> described by the National Gallery of Australia as a [...] "masterpiece" [...] when it acquired the work in 2013. Beginning in 1908, Fuller travelled extensively, living in India and England before ultimately settling in Sydney. There, she was the inaugural teacher of life drawing at the School of Fine and Applied Arts, established in 1920 by the New South Wales Society of Women Painters. She died in 1946.|$|E
500|$|Fuller's {{paintings}} {{from this period}} included A <b>Golden</b> <b>Hour,</b> described by the National Gallery of Australia as [...] "a masterpiece... giving us a gentle insight into the people, places and times that make up our history". The painting, an oil on canvas [...] high and [...] wide, portrays {{a woman and a}} man standing together in a rural setting in late afternoon, surrounded by grass, scattered gum trees, and Xanthorrhoea. When the painting was put up for sale in 2012, the auction house catalogue stated that it had been owned by William Ride, former director of the Western Australian Museum. It reported:The current owners assert that Professor Ride always understood the figures in the picture were Sir John Winthrop Hackett, (then owner of The West Australian newspaper, well known business man and philanthropist, whose gift allowed the construction of the impressive University of Western Australia buildings and St. George's Residential College) and his new wife, Deborah Vernon Hackett".|$|E

One had leisure to work, too, at whatever play-work was in one’s head, and that was usually full." ...|$|E

2500|$|In March 1892 envoy Stevens {{wrote to}} United States Secretary of State James G.

[...] "The <b>golden</b> <b>hour</b> is near at hand," [...] Stevens later wrote his old partner and friend Blaine. [...] "So long as the islands retain their own independent government there remains the possibility that England or the Canadian Dominion might secure one of the Hawaiian harbors for a coaling station." [...] Added Stevens: [...] "Annexation excludes all dangers of this kind." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{strategy}} {{developed for}} prehospital trauma care in North America {{is based on}} the <b>Golden</b> <b>Hour</b> theory, i.e., that a trauma victim's best chance for survival is in an operating room, with the goal of having the patient in surgery within an hour of the traumatic event. This appears to be true in cases of internal bleeding, especially penetrating trauma such as gunshot or stab wounds. Thus, minimal time is spent providing prehospital care (spine immobilization; [...] "ABCs", i.e. ensure airway, breathing and circulation; external bleeding control; [...] endotracheal intubation) and the victim is transported as fast as possible to a trauma centre.|$|E
2500|$|After a {{few more}} low-key, private performances, Ware and Marsh decided to officially form a band. Joined by their friend Adi Newton and another {{synthesizer}} (a Roland System-100), they formed The Future and began to create music in their own rehearsal facility in a disused cutlery workshop in the centre of Sheffield. Although The Future was never signed and did not release material commercially at the time, a collection of demos from this period was released retrospectively on CD in 2002 titled The <b>Golden</b> <b>Hour</b> of the Future, mixed by Richard X. The association with Adi Newton was short; Newton left The Future {{and went on to}} form Clock DVA. Ware at this point decided that he needed a singer rather than another keyboard player. The reason for this was twofold: record companies had been reluctant to sign The Future, as they could not offer any [...] "marketable" [...] songs, and therefore a talented singer was required for any chance of commercial success; also the group only owned two synthesizers and could not afford a third.|$|E
