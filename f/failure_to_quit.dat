Prospective cohort study evaluating 100 smokers who sought treatment at the Psychoactive Substances Outpatient Clinic. The variables gathered were sociodemographic factors; degree of dependence (Fagerström questionnaire); stage of motivation for change (University of Rhode Island Change Assessment Scale); and presence of depression and anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). The patients were followed up after 4, 8, 12 and 24 weeks to identify factors relating to <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> smoking. The patients were mostly women (75 %), between 40 and 59 years of age (67 %); with incomplete elementary education (60 %); with leisure activities (57 %); suffering from tobacco-related disease (53 %); with previous attempts to quit smoking (70 %); with a medical recommendation to stop (51 %); with encouragement to stop (66 %); and {{with a high degree}} of dependence (78 %). The main motivational stage was contemplation/action (43 %); the anxiety rate was 64 % and the depression rate was 39 %.

40|$|The authors {{conducted}} a meta-analysis of published studies to (a) evaluate {{the premise that}} a history of major depression is associated with <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> smoking and (b) identify factors that moderate the relationship between history of depression and cessation outcome. Fifteen studies met the selection requirements and were coded for various study methodology and treatment characteristics. DSTAT was used to calculate individual study effect sizes, determine the mean effect size across studies, and test for moderator effects. No differences in either short-term (≤ 3 months) or long-term abstinence rates (≥ 6 months) were observed between smokers positive versus negative for history of depression.

40|$|We {{describe}} practical, effective, office-based {{methods for}} physicians {{to use to}} assist patients to stop smoking {{that do not require}} special training or support personnel. Brief counseling achieves smoking cessation in a small percent of well patients but is more effective in patients with smoking-related illnesses or abnormal laboratory test results. Routine prescribing of nicotine gum without participation by the patient in a smoking-cessation program does not increase smoking cessation, and we do not recommend it. The prevention of smoking relapse can probably be enhanced by scheduling follow-up office visits after the patient has quit. <b>Failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> on initial attempts should not discourage physicians and patients, since most successful abstainers usually must make several attempts to quit. We outline for physicians two approaches, one brief and one more intensive, to help patients stop smoking...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Depression {{symptoms}} and diagnoses {{are associated with}} <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> smoking in most studies, but not all. METHOD: A new measure of internalization (i. e. symptoms of depression or anxiety, or poor mood) was created to investigate whether internalization would predict smoking cessation in 549 smokers from three randomized clinical trials with inconsistent findings. RESULTS: Predicted item locations based on {{a map of the}} construct of internalization agreed with empirical locations based on item response theory. Internalization was highly correlated with neuroticism. Logistic regressions showed that internalization improved upon the predictions of other affect-related measures. High baseline internalization decreased abstinence from smoking at end of treatment and 3 months thereafter. History of major depression (single-episode or recurrent) failed to predict abstinence. CONCLUSIONS: The broad, dimensional construct of internalization as conceptualized herein appears to be an important predictor of smoking cessation...|$|E
40|$|Smoking and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) {{become a}} global problem in the world.

40|$|The {{magnitude}} of smoking {{as a public}} health concern in Britain is reflected in the recent government investment to develop smoking cessation services. Smoking in pregnancy is a priority. This article presents the findings of a small qualitative research study exploring barriers to pregnant women stopping smoking.

The study participants revealed a belief system resulting in a self-fulfilling prophecy of relapse or <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit.</b> The role and meaning of smoking for women with a high caring burden and socio-economic problems resonate strongly with earlier studies. Other barriers were the influence of family and friends, how women interpreted facts relating to smoking risks and the nature of smoking cessation service delivery.

40|$|Pictorial health {{warnings}} on cigarette packs create aversive {{emotional reactions}} to smoking and induce thoughts about quitting; however, contrary to models of health behavior change, {{they do not}} appear to alter intentions <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> smoking. We propose and test a novel model of intention <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> an addictive habit such as smoking (the efficacy-desire model) that can explain this paradoxical effect. At the core of the model is the prediction that self-efficacy and desire <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> an addictive habit are inversely related. We tested the model in an online experiment that randomly exposed smokers (N = 3297) to a cigarette pack with one of three increasing levels of warning intensity. The results supported the model’s prediction that despite the effects of warnings on aversion to smoking, intention <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> smoking is an inverted U-shape function of the smoker’s self-efficacy for quitting. In addition, smokers with greater (lesser) <b>quit</b> efficacy relative <b>to</b> smoking efficacy increase (decrease) intentions <b>to</b> <b>quit.</b> The findings show that previous <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> observe effects of pictorial warning labels on quit intentions {{can be explained by the}} contradictory individual differences that warnings produce. Thus, the model explains the paradoxical finding that quit intentions do not change at the population level, even though smokers recognize the implications of warnings. The model suggests that pictorial warnings are effective for smokers with stronger quit-efficacy beliefs and provides guidance for how cigarette warnings and tobacco control strategies can be designed to help smoker...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} effect of two types of self-identity on {{attempts}} <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> smoking: self-identity in terms of smoking and self-identity in terms of quitting.

40|$|Whether trauma {{exposure}} {{itself or}} consequent {{posttraumatic stress disorder}} (PTSD) is primarily responsible for smoking and <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> remains unclear. A cohort of male Australian Vietnam veterans (N = 388) was interviewed twice, 22 and 36 years after their return to Australia using standardized psychiatric diagnostic and health interviews and assessment of combat exposure. The smoking trajectory over time revealed a spectrum of outcomes (never smoked, early quitters, late quitters, continuing smokers). Analysis used multivariate statistics to assess the relative contributions of combat trauma exposure and PTSD while controlling for potential confounders. The trajectory of smoking over time revealed that 21. 9 % of veterans had never smoked, 45. 1 % had quit smoking {{by the time of}} wave 1, 16. 2 % were current smokers at wave 1 who had quit by the time of wave 2, 2. 8 % were late adopters who were current smokers and 13. 9 % were continuing smokers. Smoking was associated in single-predictor models with demographics, intelligence, combat exposure, PTSD symptom clusters and diagnosis, and alcohol disorders. Multivariate analysis revealed that PTSD, combat and intelligence were related to the smoking spectrum but, after adding demographics and other Axis I psychiatric diagnoses, only combat remained significant. No PTSD symptom cluster uniquely predicted smoking status. The results suggest trauma exposure in the form of military combat may be a more robust predictor of smoking status over time than PTSD. It may be stress itself, rather than post-stress disorder, that is more germane to smoking and <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit.</b> Exposure to traumatic stress and development of PTSD have been implicated separately in maintenance of smoking. This longitudinal cohort study of smoking in war veterans up to three decades post-war enabled evaluation of traumatic stress exposure in combat and the course of PTSD in smoking and quitting while controlling for intelligence, background disadvantage and other psychiatric conditions. Combat rather than PTSD emerged as more significant to smoking status, suggesting it may be the traumatic stress itself rather than the development of a post-stress disorder that is more germane to smoking in war veterans...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES. The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{describe}} age patterns of smoking among Black and White women of reproductive age, with cohort membership controlled for. METHOD. Data from the 1987 National Health Interview Survey Cancer Supplement, weighted to be nationally representative, were used to calculate the fractions of women who were ever smokers, quitters, and current smokers by age and race. Summary distributions of age patterns of smoking behaviors by race were estimated; proportional hazard models were used to avoid confounding of age and cohort. RESULTS. White women begin smoking at younger ages than do Blacks but are more likely to quit and to do so at young ages. Rates of current smoking converge between Blacks and Whites by age 25, and may cross over by 30. Education-standardized results show larger Black-White differentials in ever smoking and smaller differences in quitting. CONCLUSIONS. Our findings confirm that women's age patterns of smoking vary by race. Age x race interactions should be considered in smoking research and anti-tobacco interventions. For Black women, delayed initiation and <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> call for increased emphasis on interventions tailored to adults. These findings have possible implications for understanding Black-White differences in low birthweight, child health, and women's health...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: As Stop Smoking Clinics (SSCs) {{become more}} common across the globe, it is {{important}} to know how far one can make broad generalisations concerning characteristics of smokers who attend these clinics and factors that predict their success. This involves accumulation of data from different countries. Objective: The aim of this study was to identify characteristics of smokers and factors leading up to quitting with clinics in Malaysia. Method: Records from 629 smokers who had sought help from five selected SSCs in Malaysia from January 2006 to June 2007 were analysed. Results: The characteristics of smokers attending Malaysian smoking clinics were broadly similar to those in Western countries. Consistent with the findings from other countries, older age and longest duration of previous quit attempts were associated with successful smoking cessation. Greater baseline carbon-monoxide readings (OR 0. 96, 95 CI 0. 93 - 0. 99 : p = 0. 013). but not Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND), predicted <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> at six-month in multivariate analysis. Success rates varied greatly between clinics even after adjusting for all other predictors. Conclusion: In these rare data from a non-Western culture some predictors of successful smoking cessation appeared to generalise from Western smokers but the universal validity of the FTND in particular needs to be examined further.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the predictors of the willingness <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> smoking among a cohort of male Saudi students. MethodsIn this cross-sectional study, a questionnaire was administered to a cohort of male students that were recruited from three institutes of higher education. Using the retrieved data, bivariate analysis and logistic regression tests were performed to assess the factors associated with the willingness <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> smoking. ResultsOf 467 participants, 24 % of respondents were current smokers, while 65 % of these smokers were willing <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> smoking. In the bivariate analysis, past attempts <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> smoking and the anti-smoking messages on TV and in newspapers were significantly associated with the willingness <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> smoking. Only one variable – past attempts <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> smoking – was a significant predictor of the willingness <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> smoking, as shown by the multivariate logistic regression analysis. ConclusionThe findings of this study indicate that Saudi male students who smoke are willing <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> smoking; having unsuccessfully attempted <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> smoking in the past, they are willing to try again. Successful programs should be developed for male university students in KSA to assist them in their quest <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> smoking and maintain cessation...|$|R
40|$|African Americans (AAs) {{have been}} {{considered}} a hard to reach research population. In a clinical trial of bupropion for smoking cessation, <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> return for randomization was concerning during the initial phase of recruitment. There were three study goals: to review the research on clinical trial participation barriers, to use quantitative analyses to identify differences between randomized (n = 66) and non-randomized (n = 54) participants, and to use focus groups and interviews (2 groups and 2 interviews, 17 participants) to elicit participation barriers and suggestions for participation enhancement. Randomized participants were older (44. 1 vs. 37. 6; p = 0. 0019), predominately female (81. 8 % vs. 63. 0 %; p = 0. 0201), {{more likely to have}} some college (33. 3 % vs. 16. 7 %; p = 0. 0380), and less likely to be employed full time (32. 4 % vs. 53. 7 %; p = 0. 0347).

40|$|Aims: Potential {{exists for}} {{improving}} the impact of quit-smoking programmes, by recruiting smokers in early motivational stages, by using active recruitment strategies, and by offering professional assistance <b>to</b> <b>quit.</b> Methods: This was a randomized population-based intervention study, in Copenhagen, Denmark. A total of 2, 408 daily smokers in all motivational stages were included. All participants completed a questionnaire, and underwent a health examination and a lifestyle consultation. Smokers in the high-intensity intervention were offered assistance <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> smoking in smoking cessation groups. Results: Before the lifestyle consultation only 11 % of the smokers stated that they planned <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> within one month. After the lifestyle consultation 27 % accepted smoking cessation in groups and an additional 12 % planned <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> without assistance. Of the smokers who accepted smoking cessation groups 23 % had not been planning <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> before the lifestyle consultation. Being a woman, having high tobacco consumption, having a long smoking history, having tried <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> within the previous year, and having a higher motivation <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> predicted participation in smoking cessation groups. Conclusions: It was possible to recruit {{a large number of}} smokers in early motivational stages by using active recruitment strategies and by offering assistance <b>to</b> <b>quit.</b> Lifestyle consultations markedly increased the number of smokers willing <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>quit.</b> Smokers preferred assistance <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> in a smoking cessation group <b>to</b> <b>quitting</b> on their own; therefore, it is important to improve recruitment strategies for smoking cessation programmes...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{study the}} {{development}} of smoking behavior in adolescents using a longitudinal, multivariate design. METHODS: Adolescents (n = 14, 133, age range 12 to 18 years) {{took part in the}} longitudinal Add Health study (two waves, separated by 1 year, 56 % smokers and 44 % nonsmokers at Wave 1). Eight risk factor domains were established at Wave 1 (daily activities, psychological health, personality, school situation, family functioning, rough living, religion, and neighborhood status), which were further separated into subdomains by factor analysis. Subdomains were used to predict risk at Wave 2 of smoking initiation, progression, or failure to discontinue, using logistic regression analysis. Analyses were performed for boys and girls separately and results corrected for age, race, urbanicity, and socioeconomic status. RESULTS: Use/abuse of other substances by self and peers influenced most stages of smoking, whereas trouble in school was associated with initiation and progression of smoking. Poor family relations predicted initiation of experimental smoking for girls, whereas low involvement in active pastimes predicted failure to discontinue experimental smoking. For boys, low religiosity predicted progression to regular smoking and <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> regular smoking, whereas delinquency also reduced success of regular smoking discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: These findings may direct efforts for prevention and intervention of adolescent smoking behavior and may also provide guidance for future studies...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: In {{search of}} less {{time-consuming}} methods of smoking cessation Allen Carr’ seminars performed at workplaces in Austria were evaluated. Methods: 308 (86 %) of all 357 smokers attending a seminar in summer 2002 gave {{consent to participate}} in a repeated health survey, including the SF- 36 questionnaire. 268 (87 %) gave computer aided telephone interviews after 3 months and 223 (72 %) after one year. Analysis by logistic regression was done separately for males and females. Results: The one year quit rate was 40 % (worst case assumption) – 55 % (best estimate). In 96 % of quitters an intensive counselling for 6 hours without pharmaceutical aid thereafter was sufficient to maintain abstinence for 12 months. A long smoking history or many earlier unsuccessful attempts to quit did not predict failure. The risk of relapse was found higher in young men with high number of pack-years and in women with good physical fitness but high Fagerstroem score and financial reasons for the intention to quit smoking. While an average weight gain of 3 kg in males was not associated with <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> smoking, we found the highest weight gain (4 kg) in females in the group abstinent at 3 months but smoking again at 12 months. In quitters general health scored bySF- 36 improved. Conclusions: Group counselling at the workplace was found to be an efficient method of smoking cessation, capable to increase subjective life quality and health and to smooth the way to smoke-free enterprises...|$|E
40|$|This was an {{investigation}} of possible relationships between pretreatment status of psychological adjustment and smoking treatment outcome. More specifically, the potential utilities of five variables associated with psychological adjustment (i. e., anxiety, depression, personal security, life stress, and assertiveness) for predicting smoking status at treatment end, 3 -month follow-up, and 6 -month follow-up were examined. Results indicated that psychological adjustment, defined as the five adjustment variables in combination, {{was not related to}} smoking status at any of the three assessment times; when the adjustment variables were considered individually, the only relationship identified was between life stress and end-of-treatment smoking status. More specifically, smokers who experienced quit episodes at treatment end reported lower levels of life stress during the year preceding treatment than nonquitters. Depression and anxiety, which had been shown to be predictors for smokers from medical populations, were not related to treatment outcome for the more heterogeneous sample in this experiment; therefore, high-risk smokers may differ in significant ways from smokers in general and these differences may interact with some aspects of psychological adjustment to the detriment of cessation attempts. As higher levels of life stress were not associated with greater amounts of negative emotions, the mechanism underlying the relationship between life instability and quitting remains undefined. The possibility that life stress interferes with cessation attempts via a distraction affect is proposed; also, selection of stress management strategies that are detrimental to quitting is suggested as a factor that underlies the relationship between higher levels of life changes and <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} {{whether the}} time and risk parameters and the factors analysed in previous research predict the success of smoking cessation. Design: A longitudinal survey for smokers who recently started to quit. Time and preference parameters are individually estimated using a discrete choice experiment (DCE). Setting: Japan, 2007. Participants: A total of 689 smokers who began quitting smoking within the last month. Main outcome measures: Time discount rate, the coefficient of risk aversion, and duration of smoking cessation. Results: Within a proportional hazards regression model, the high time discount rate is associated with <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> (hazard ratio: 1. 17, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 10 to 1. 24, P < 0. 001). The high coefficient of risk aversion improves the overall success of smoking cessation (0. 20, 0. 07 to 0. 53, P = 0. 001). Among the conventional variables analysed in previous research, the high self-efficacy of quitting (0. 87, 0. 79 to 0. 95, P = 0. 003), the use of nicotine replacement therapy (0. 68, 0. 49 to 0. 96, P = 0. 029) and high nicotine dependence are associated with successful cessation. Inexperienced quitters are {{significantly more likely to}} fail to quit (3. 35, 1. 61 to 7. 00, P = 0. 001). Age, gender, health status and mood variations have no significant effect.

METHODS: We examined 25 years of data from Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA), an ongoing study of a community-based cohort of 5115 men and women aged 18 to 30 years at baseline with periodic re-examinations. At each examination smoking, quitting, and relapse were queried. We examined prevalence of smoking relapse among 3603 participants who attended at least 6 of the 8 examinations. RESULTS: About 53 % of 3603 participants never reported smoking on a regular basis. Among the remaining 1682 ever smokers, 52. 8 % of those who reported current smoking at baseline were still smoking {{by the end of}} the study, compared to 10. 7 % of those who initiated smoking by year 5. Among those classified as former smokers at baseline, 39 % relapsed at least once; of these, 69. 5 % had quit again {{by the end of the}} study. Maximum education level attained, age at study baseline, and race were associated with <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> smoking by the end of the study and relapse among those who did quit. Maximum education level attained and age at study baseline were also associated with ability to successfully quit after a relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Smoking relapse after quitting is common, especially in those with lower education level. Education was the strongest predictor of all three outcomes. Improvements in access to treatment and treatment options, especially for underserved populations, are needed to prevent relapse when smokers quit...|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} (i) {{describe}} concurrent and simultaneous tobacco and cannabis use and (ii) investigate {{the association between}} cannabis use and motivation and intentions <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> tobacco {{in a sample of}} socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2013 and 2014 with current tobacco smokers receiving aid from two community service organizations in New South Wales, Australia. At least weekly cannabis use for the month prior to survey, motivation <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> tobacco and intentions <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> tobacco were measured in 369 participants (77 % consent rate). Regressions were carried out to investigate associations between weekly cannabis use and motivation and intentions <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> tobacco. Concurrent tobacco and cannabis use was reported by 19 % (n= 71) of the sample and of these users, 100 % reported simultaneous use. Although regular cannabis use was significantly associated with lower motivation <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> tobacco, it was not significantly associated with intentions <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> tobacco in the next 30 days. Concurrent cannabis use is common in disadvantaged smokers and {{may play a role in}} decreased motivation <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> tobacco; however, it does not appear to be associated with intentions <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> in a sample of disadvantaged smokers...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aims of {{our study}} were to (1) assess {{technology}} use (eg, texting, social media, Internet) among smokers in the United States and United Kingdom, (2) examine whether technology use differs between smokers who are motivated <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> and smokers who are not motivated <b>to</b> <b>quit,</b> (3) examine previous use of technology to assist with smoking cessation, and (4) examine future intentions to use technology to assist with smoking cessation. Methods: articipants were 1000 adult smokers (54. 90 %, 549 / 1000 female; mean age 43. 9, SD 15. 5 years; US: n= 500, UK: n= 500) who were recruited via online representative sampling strategies. Data were collected online and included demographics, smoking history, and frequency and patterns of technology use. Results: Among smokers in general, there was a high prevalence of mobile and smartphone ownership, sending and receiving texts, downloading and using apps, using Facebook, and visiting health-related websites. Smokers who were unmotivated <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> were {{significantly less likely to}} own a smartphone or handheld device that connects to the Internet than smokers motivated <b>to</b> <b>quit.</b> There was a significantly lower prevalence of sending text messages among US smokers unmotivated <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> (78. 2 %, 179 / 229) versus smokers motivated <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> (95. 0 %, 229 / 241), but {{no significant differences between the}} UK groups (motivated: 96. 4 %, 239 / 248; unmotivated: 94. 9 %, 223 / 235). Smokers unmotivated <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> in both countries were significantly less likely to use a handheld device to read email, play games, browse the Web, or visit health-related websites versus smokers motivated <b>to</b> <b>quit.</b> US smokers had a high prevalence of app downloads regardless of motivation <b>to</b> <b>quit,</b> but UK smokers who were motivated <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> had greater prevalence of app downloads than smokers unmotivated <b>to</b> <b>quit.</b> US smokers were significantly more likely to have a Facebook account (87. 0 %, 435 / 500) than UK smokers (76. 4 %, 382 / 500), but smokers unmotivated <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> in both countries used Facebook less frequently than smokers motivated <b>to</b> <b>quit.</b> Smokers who were unmotivated <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> were less likely to have used eHealth or mHealth platforms <b>to</b> help them <b>quit</b> smoking in the past and less likely to say that they would use them for smoking cessation in the future. Conclusions: Although smokers unmotivated <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> make less use of technology than smokers motivated <b>to</b> <b>quit,</b> there is sufficient prevalence to make it worthwhile to develop eHealth and mHealth interventions to encourage cessation. Short and low-effort communications, such as text messaging, might be better for smokers who are less motivated <b>to</b> <b>quit.</b> Multiple channels may be required to reach unmotivated smokers...|$|R
