40|$|ObjectiveThis study {{aimed at}} {{investigating}} {{the results of}} second-trimester amniocyte karyotyping in western and eastern Taiwan, and identifying any regional differences in the prevalence of fetal chromosomal anomalies. MethodsFrom 2004 to 2009, pregnant women who underwent amniocentesis in their second trimester at three hospitals <b>in</b> western <b>Taiwan</b> and at four hospitals <b>in</b> eastern <b>Taiwan</b> were included. All the cytogenetic analyses of cultured amniocytes were performed in the cytogenetics laboratory of the Genetic Counseling Center of Hualien Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital. We used the chi-square test, Student t test, and Mann–Whitney U test to evaluate the variants of clinical indications, amniocyte karyotyping results, and prevalence and types of chromosomal anomalies in western and eastern Taiwan. ResultsDuring the study period, 3573 samples, 1990 (55. 7 %) from western Taiwan and 1583 (44. 3 %) from eastern Taiwan, were collected and analyzed. The main indication for amniocyte karyotyping was advanced maternal age (69. 0 % <b>in</b> western <b>Taiwan,</b> 67. 1 % <b>in</b> eastern <b>Taiwan).</b> The detection rates of chromosomal anomalies by amniocyte karyotyping <b>in</b> eastern <b>Taiwan</b> (45 / 1582, 2. 8 %) {{did not differ significantly}} from that <b>in</b> western <b>Taiwan</b> (42 / 1989, 2. 1 %) (p =  1. 58). Mothers who had abnormal ultrasound findings and histories of familial hereditary diseases or chromosomal anomalies had higher detection rates of chromosomal anomalies (9. 3 % and 7. 2 %, respectively). The detection rate of autosomal anomalies was higher <b>in</b> eastern <b>Taiwan</b> (93. 3 % vs. 78. 6 %, p =  0. 046), but the detection rate of sex-linked chromosomal anomalies was higher <b>in</b> western <b>Taiwan</b> (21. 4 % vs. 6. 7 %, p =  0. 046). ConclusionWe demonstrated regional differences in second-trimester amniocyte karyotyping results and established a database of common chromosomal anomalies that could be useful for genetic counseling, especially <b>in</b> eastern <b>Taiwan...</b>|$|R
