50|$|A {{number of}} BMP-1s were fitted with {{mountings}} for the KMT-10 plow-type mine-clearing {{system in the}} early 1980s. It is installed {{on the front of}} the hull in line with the tracks. The plow weighs 450 kg and can be attached in 30 minutes. Emergency detaching takes around 10 minutes. The KMT-10 is intended for clearing anti-tank mines under different ground conditions. It is pneumatically driven and takes four seconds to switch from the traveling position to the <b>digging</b> <b>position.</b> The mine-clearing plows are very narrow, with just two digging tines, each 300 mm wide, (the same as each track), which limits them to clearing surface-laid mines, in particular scatterable anti-tank mines. A chain mounted between the plows can detonate tilt-rod mines. Maximum mine-clearing speed is 15 km/h.|$|E

50|$|The siege {{was unique}} in that instead of {{starving}} the garrison out Maurice instead used his guns to scare the garrison into surrender but even failing that; digging mines and using powder to blow up bastions {{and the use of}} his own soldiers as pioneers rather than farmers or labourers to <b>dig</b> <b>positions.</b> This was {{a turning point in the}} conduct of siege warfare in that engineers greatly enhanced the success.|$|R
50|$|The Corps of Royal Engineers {{were formed}} in 1717. In 1770, the Company of Soldier Artificers formed a {{specialist}} tunnelling troop in Gibraltar to <b>dig</b> defensive <b>positions</b> into the Rock.|$|R

50|$|On 5 April the 34th Infantry Division Band {{was moved}} by LST to a desolate beachhead for {{participation}} in the Battle of Anzio. With the battle in full swing, the unit acted quickly to <b>dig</b> fortified <b>positions</b> and secure unit equipment.|$|R
5000|$|On 8 February, {{there were}} no {{reported}} shooting incidents. However, Cambodian troops reportedly used the fragile ceasefire to <b>dig</b> new <b>positions</b> and to set up sandbags.

50|$|The {{remainder}} of September was spent <b>digging</b> defensive <b>positions</b> {{in and around}} Peira Cava. The 517th RCT now held a thinly manned 15 mi front, using mines and booby-traps {{to take the place}} of troopers. Attacks on Hill 1098 ended the month with the roar of artillery duels echoing through the Maritime Alps.|$|R
50|$|Caco only {{became a}} brigade {{commander}} {{because of the}} confusion of the Yugoslav secession crisis {{in the spring of}} 1992. He managed to form his own brigade while the Bosnian government pursued a peaceful resolution. His brigade was infamous for rounding up Sarajevo's citizens and forcing them to <b>dig</b> defensive <b>positions</b> in his areas of responsibility.|$|R
25|$|Later {{in the day}} the Ethiopian force {{advanced}} to Jandkundisho, a suburb of Beledweyn, and continued to pound the hills surrounding Beledweyne, before <b>digging</b> into defensive <b>positions</b> outside Beledweyn.|$|R
5000|$|Matthijs Dulken, a {{seasoned}} and wily commander, {{was the head}} of the Spanish army occupying Grol. He had available to him 1,200 foot soldiers (not accounting enlisted citizens) and around 100 cavalry, commanded by Lambert Verreyken. Food and supplies aplenty, Dulken ordered his troops to reinforce the defenses of the already fortified city, and specifically: [...] "...by musket or cannonball, to hurt or damage the enemy any which way". With the circumvallation line ready, Grol was being bombarded by the Dutch army while groups of Dutch, English, French troops dug saps towards the city. Damage done to the city's defenses were continually repaired by the besieged. However, 200 incendiary [...] "fireballs" [...] were shot into the city, causing heavy damage to buildings and people. Dulken himself was wounded in his shoulder by a musket bullet and gave command to Verreyken. Verreyken and his cavalry raided the attackers positions, mainly the trench <b>digging</b> <b>positions</b> and the rampart of Ernst Casimir of Nassau-Dietz, without causing many casualties. In Grol, due to the carelessness of a soldier, two barrels of gunpowder exploded, causing forty bystanders to perish.|$|R
500|$|During Milošević's {{trial at}} the International Criminal Tribunal {{for the former}} Yugoslavia, Delić testified that an investigative judge from Niš visited the Košare outpost shortly after {{fighting}} had ceased, and conducted an on-site investigation. Journalists {{were not allowed to}} visit the site due to [...] "security concerns". On April 24, Western reporters saw VJ personnel <b>digging</b> mortar <b>positions</b> south of Dečani, about [...] from the Albanian border. The troops said they had been exchanging gunfire with the rebels over the previous two days.|$|R
2500|$|On 26 March, the {{battalion}} reached {{their positions on}} 26 March 1941 and began fortifying them. Shuttleworth positioned his headquarters {{in the village of}} Palaio Eleftherochori, close to the railway line on the Greek eastern coast near the Gulf of Salonika. The rifle companies were positioned next to the railway and the main north road. Their right was on the coast and their left four miles inland, at the positions of the 25th Battalion. To the 25th's left was 4th Brigade. On 27 March, the 19th and 26th Battalions, each missing one company, were sent back to Olympus Pass to <b>dig</b> <b>positions</b> for 5th Brigade. The division's front was 28,000 yards, held by the seven battalions of 4th and 6th Brigades less three detached companies. [...] The battalion's positions were on high ground, with the left of the sector wooded. However, the right sector was in open country and usable by armoured vehicles, so an anti-tank ditch was placed on the line of the Toponitsa stream, where the 6th Brigade lines were. They were supported by the artillery of the 4th and 5th Field Regiments. To the north of this was the Aliakmon River, whose bridges were mined by the 1st British Armoured Brigade.|$|R
50|$|Soviet Spetsnaz {{units were}} well {{trained in the}} use of the {{standard}} short-handled Russian entrenching shovel ("saperka") as a weapon; by the nature of their missions, such tools were only rarely used for <b>digging</b> or entrenching <b>positions.</b> Modern commando forces, too, are trained to fight with entrenchment tools.|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of World War II in September 1939, Hayes led his battalion overseas to France {{as part of the}} British Expeditionary Force (BEF), arriving there in the third week of September. The battalion, {{along with the rest of}} the BEF, was not immediately engaged in action, unlike in World War I, and instead spent most of its time in France <b>digging</b> defensive <b>positions,</b> with relatively little time being allotted to training, as most of the Allied politicians and military commanders expecting a repeat of the trench warfare of 1914-1918.|$|R
25|$|On 11 July, Rawlinson {{met again}} with the corps commanders and divisional commanders, who wanted the {{original}} plan reinstated. Haig compromised with a scheme in which XV Corps, with reinforcements, would still attack first but XIII Corps would <b>dig</b> <b>positions</b> on the south slopes of the ridge from Longueval to Bazentin and send patrols forward, ready to attack if it were feasible, to assist the XV Corps attack against both Bazentin woods and Bazentin le Petit. XV Corps would wheel east, to roll up the defences opposite XIII Corps which would then attack. Rawlinson contacted Haig again on 12 July and his Major-General General Staff (MGGS) Archibald Montgomery, contacted Launcelot Kiggell the BEF Chief of the General Staff, to make a final appeal. Haig gave way, provided that the supporting points were built by XIII Corps and the flanks were protected by garrisons in Mametz and Trônes woods. Most of Mametz Wood had already been captured and the fight for Trônes Wood continued. Haig was also reassured by Major-General Noel Birch the BEF MGRA (Major-General Royal Artillery) that the bombardment was succeeding, that German underground shelters in the second position would be shallower than those overrun on 1 July, that the British had gained artillery superiority and that a dawn attack would mean {{plenty of time for}} exploitation.|$|R
5|$|Amidst growing {{concerns}} amongst Australian {{military commanders}} about Japanese intentions, the scheduled {{replacement of the}} 22nd Brigade was cancelled, and the 2/18th remained in Seremban until they were transported east to Jemaluang in August. The following month they were sent north to Mersing, which, situated {{on the east coast}} of the Malay Peninsula, was considered a likely place for a Japanese landing as it offered a short route of advance towards Singapore. At Mersing, the battalion was set to work <b>digging</b> defensive <b>positions</b> and constructing wire obstacles, punctuated by familiarisation patrols and anti-aircraft, anti-gas and mortar training.|$|R
25|$|During the weekend, the NLA {{entered the}} ethnic Macedonian villages of Brezno and Varvara and started <b>digging</b> in <b>positions.</b> Insurgents also started digging in above the big ethnic Macedonian village of Lesok.

25|$|Bait tactics {{exploited}} the US focus on body counts and its lavish use of firepower, including relatively ineffective Harassment and Interdiction (H) fire.

The policy within the BEF was for the Regular Army formations to transfer units to the TA units which, for various reasons, were not as well trained as their Regular counterparts, and this would, in theory, strengthen the Territorial formations.|$|R
30|$|Despite the {{implementation}} of the 811 One-Call System that requires excavation contractors to call the state One-Call center that in turn, informs utility owners to mark utility locations with spray paint or flags, excavation remains the single largest cause of pipeline accidents. For instance, a UNCC (Utility Notification Center of Colorado (UNCC) 2005) study reported that 55.7 % of the 9, 371 incidents in Colorado in 2005 occurred even though the excavators followed the One-Call procedure. These incidents occur due to two primary reasons: (1) reliable data regarding the true location of underground utilities is missing or incomplete, i.e., utilities are often NOT at locations where the records specify (Sterling et al. 2009); and (2) uncertainty in the utility location is not communicated to excavator operators in real-time to help them objectively perceive the <b>digging</b> machine’s <b>position</b> relative to the buried utilities (Sterling et al. 2009;CGER - Commission on Geosciences, Environment and Resources Environment and Resources 2000).|$|R
50|$|After being {{informed}} of the failure in Hauho, Reden realized his men were soon to face an overwhelming enemy. At 3:00 pm, Reden ordered his men to <b>dig</b> into defensive <b>positions.</b> The Germans formed a 1.5 kilometre-long line of trenches in the fields surrounding the village. Reden also called for additional forces and General major Wolf decided to send a unit of 200-300 men, {{under the command of}} major Lothar von Brandenstein. His troops never reached their destination as they were stuck in a fight with the Reds by the small lake of Pannujärvi, 3 kilometres west of Syrjäntaka.|$|R

50|$|Notably, {{the player}} can only {{dig a hole}} to the sides, and not {{directly}} underneath himself. This introduces an important strategy for when digging a hole x blocks deep, the player must first dig a gap at least x wide {{to be able to}} dig through it, as the number of spaces will shrink with each layer, and the player needs at least one free adjacent space to be able to dig. However, exceptions to this rule arise when the player <b>digs</b> from the <b>position</b> of standing on a ladder, or hanging from a hand-to-hand bar, which allows the player to repeatedly dig and descend one row. This kind of digging is involved in solving many of the levels.|$|R
