Conversely, the swamp is described in themes that convey it as shrouded in mist at night, and a place Nick deliberately tries not to think about. When he wakes in the morning, regenerated by sleep, he feels stronger and the swamp seems less threatening.|$|E

Alan is able to defeat the crazed version of himself, waking up back at the cabin in the lake, and realizes that he is still trapped.|$|E

In this method tried to find binary value of each {{character}} of text message {{and then in the}} next stage, tried to find <b>dark</b> <b>places</b> of gray image (black) by converting the original image to binary image for labeling each object of image by considering on 8 connectivity. Then these images have been converted to RGB image in order to find <b>dark</b> <b>places.</b> Because in this way each sequence of gray color turns into RGB color and dark level of grey image is found by this way if the Gary image is very light the histogram must be changed manually to find just <b>dark</b> <b>places.</b> In the final stage each 8 pixels of <b>dark</b> <b>places</b> has been considered as a byte and binary value of each character has been put in low bit of each byte that was created manually by <b>dark</b> <b>places</b> pixels for increasing security of the main way of steganography (LSB).

25|$|Oxytocin {{helps the}} uterus to {{contract}} quickly and the contractions {{to last for}} longer. It is the first line treatment for PPH when its cause is the uterus not contracting well. A combination of syntocinon and ergometrine is commonly used as part of active management of the third stage of labour. This is called syntometrine. Syntocinon alone lowers the risk of PPH. Based on limited research available {{it is unclear whether}} syntocinon or syntometrine is most effective in preventing PPH but adverse effects are worse with syntometrine making syntocinon a more attractive option. Ergometrine also has to be kept cool and in a <b>dark</b> <b>place</b> so that it is safe to use. It does reduce the risk of PPH by improving the tone of the uterus when compared with no treatment however it has to be used with caution due to its effect raising blood pressure and causing worse after pains.|$|E
25|$|Service on Flowers in the North Atlantic was {{typically}} cold, wet, monotonous and uncomfortable. Every dip of the forecastle into an oncoming wave {{was followed by}} a cascade of water into the well deck amidships. Men at action stations were drenched with spray, and water entered living spaces through hatches opened to access ammunition magazines. Interior decks were constantly wet and condensation dripped from the overheads. The head (or sanitary toilet) was drained by a straight pipe to the ocean; and a reverse flow of the icy North Atlantic would cleanse the backside of those using it during rough weather. By 1941 corvettes carried twice as many crewmen as anticipated in the original design. Men slept on lockers or tabletops or in any <b>dark</b> <b>place</b> that offered a little warmth. The inability to store perishable food meant a reliance on preserved food such as corned-beef and powdered potato for all meals.|$|E

500|$|The {{green and}} golden bell frog is a large, stout frog; adults range from [...] in length; typical {{specimens}} measure [...] The green and golden bell frog is therefore {{one of the}} largest Australian frogs. Mature males are generally smaller than mature females, and the colour on their dorsal surfaces differ greatly from females. It may be almost completely green, of shades from dark pea-green to bright emerald, green with metallic, brassy, dull copper-brown, or gold markings; or almost completely bronze. Generally, females tend to have more green patches than males. During the cooler months (May–August), when the frogs are inactive, colouration may darken almost to black. They can also darken in this way by simply staying in a <b>dark</b> <b>place</b> for a few minutes, and the colour can also change during the frogs' lifetimes.|$|E
500|$|For the {{literary}} theorist Thomas S. Hischak, The Turn of the Screw is a weak {{adaptation of the}} novella, with poor acting which can be [...] "ascribed to the trite, anachronistic dialogue and leaden direction". He likens the film to In a <b>Dark</b> <b>Place</b> (2006), another film adaptation of James's novella, which focuses upon the supposed sexual aspects of the story. For Hischack, the 2009 film presents a governess who is not successful in repressing her sexuality. Ann's fantasies of her own sexual encounters with the Master, {{as well as her}} visions of the sexual encounters between Quint and Jessel, [...] "are among the many obvious and clumsy aspects of this adaptation". Like Sborgi, Hischak sees little ambiguity in the film, calling it a [...] "misguided adaptation that likes to spell things out for the viewer".|$|E

I'm putting myself into this very <b>dark</b> <b>place</b> which I know sadly {{is a reality}} for so many women. Zainab's confidence has been steadily eroded. She's feeling isolated and has fallen under Yusef's control. He wants revenge. She is totally in his power. I had to show this can happen to any woman, no matter how strong she seems. Zainab was strong and not naive, but a woman is vulnerable if the man hits the right psychological weak spots. But both Ace and I have {{found it hard to}} do. I've known Ace {{for a long time and}} we're good friends. He has been wonderful to work with on this and very concerned about me all the way through."

500|$|On March 31, 2015, Billboard premiered a remix of {{the song}} by Dutch DJ Don Diablo, who changed the ballad into an EDM track. Another set of remixes were {{released}} later as a Remix EP. Two of the remixes were released on Madonna's Tidal streaming account, including one by DJ RedTop as well as Armand Van Helden, Offer Nissim and Roger Sanchez. According to Idolator, [...] "RedTop completely deconstructs 'Ghosttown' and turns it into something you might hear in a post-apocalyptic piano bar. It's sad and depressing yet defiantly groovy." [...] Another remix, by Paul Andrews, gave emphasis on Madonna's vocals while adding piano and orchestra in the production. Andrews explained that the music video of [...] "Ghosttown" [...] was how he had imagined it, [...] "two people in a <b>dark</b> <b>place</b> with destruction all around them, but they have each other". Hence he wanted the verse to represent {{the reality of the}} situation and the chorus would represent their view of the world because of their love. The non-dance remix was approved by Madonna and was another exclusive release to her Tidal account.|$|E
500|$|The {{reception}} of the music video was mixed, with many critics noting its dark theme. James Montgomery of MTV reviewed the video stating:,"There's seemingly no bottom to the inky depths Rihanna plumbs in her brand-new 'Russian Roulette' video, a dark, claustrophobic descent that's creepier than anything she's ever done before (including the 'Disturbia' video)". Katy Hall from The Huffington Post commented that the video comes from a pretty <b>dark</b> <b>place</b> and tells more depressing story than Lady Gaga's [...] "Bad Romance". According to Daniel Kreps from Rolling Stone, {{there is a lot}} of imagery that is influenced by the altercation of Rihanna and Chris Brown from February 2009, including a speeding car that approaches Rihanna while she stands alone at night– [...] "a moment that seems to mirror the events immediately following the assault". Megan Masters from E! Online commented that the video [...] "portrays [...] "some seemingly real emotion with her bouncing back-and-forth between writhing around a padded cell." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson from Entertainment Weekly supported the dark imagery used in the video, explaining, [...] "What, you thought Rihanna was going to give 'Russian Roulette' a video full of sunshine and rainbows and peppy choreography? Her first single from Rated R is a song about violence".|$|E

500|$|The use of fake weapons {{generated}} controversy. After {{the concert}} in Colorado, Madonna was criticised {{over the use}} of fake weapons, since the public was sensitized by the 2012 Aurora shooting, which occurred at the premiere of The Dark Knight Rises. Peter Burns, a radio broadcaster in the region, told The Hollywood Reporter that [...] "You could see people kinda looking at each other. I heard the word 'Colorado', you know, 'Aurora', 'shooting'. You could hear people talking about it, and it was little bit unsettling. I saw two or three people get up and grab their stuff and actually leave their seats". Ray Mark Rinaldi from Reverb website said that Madonna was [...] "dancing with guns and shooting up bad guys during 'Revolver'. It was a bloody scene, particularly tasteless in Colorado these days, but all cartoon; if folks got upset, they were supposed to". Daniel Brokman from The Phoenix said: [...] "Madonna took the capacity crowd into a <b>dark</b> <b>place</b> that few were expecting minutes earlier from this queen of '80s pop music".

500|$|Due to Santaolalla's {{stance on}} {{composing}} music—he lacks knowledge {{in reading and}} writing sheet music, preferring to simply record—he began working on The Last of Us early in development. To give Santaolalla a point to base his music, Druckmann simply {{told him about the}} story and themes, as opposed to giving specific instructions on composing; Santaolalla appreciated this freedom, feeling it assisted in the composing. To compose, Santaolalla felt the need to [...] "go into some more <b>dark</b> <b>place,</b> more textural and not necessarily melodic". To challenge himself, Santaolalla used a variety of unique instruments he was unfamiliar with, giving a sense of danger and innocence. For The Last of Us, he used a detuned guitar, producing deep noise. To produce unique tunes, Santaolalla recorded in various rooms, including a bathroom and kitchen. The team wanted the game's AI to affect the music. They also tried to make the music evoke a reaction from the player, as their familiarization with the sounds would trigger a previous emotion that they felt. Music manager Jonathan Mayer felt that the game's action music was atypical of action music in other games, stating that it's [...] "relatively low-key", and that taking it out of context changes the immediate reaction to it. The game's theme, [...] "The Last of Us", was the first piece of music that the team received, and they were very impressed.|$|E
