This activity was developed independently of new conceptions of disability which, through the impetus provided by disabled persons movements and disability studies, were at the same time the object of a broad international debate which led to classification and to new legislation and recommendations. This situation of impermeability between the two <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> on disability – perinatal medicine on the one hand, public policies and social action on the other – led to practices being anchored in radically different conceptions of disability. The author sets out the current situation for the management and practice of prenatal diagnosis in France, and attempts to analyse the reasons behind difficulties in reconciling these two <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> by looking back at the sociohistorical modalities of their construction. Two ideas are put forward: the State's delegation to different actors in the two fields, and the extension – ratified by the enclave of the medical institution – of “therapeutic abortion” to include foetal indications...|$|R
