5|$|Medicinal {{plants are}} often tough and fibrous, {{requiring}} {{some form of}} preparation to make them convenient to administer. According to the Institute for Traditional Medicine, common methods for the preparation of herbal medicines include <b>decoction,</b> powdering, and extraction with alcohol, in each case yielding a mixture of substances. <b>Decoction</b> involves crushing and then boiling the plant material in water to produce a liquid extract. Powdering involves drying the plant material and then crushing it to yield a powder that can be compressed into tablets. Alcohol extraction involves soaking the plant material in cold wine or distilled spirit to form a tincture.|$|E
40|$|This study {{compared}} Ojeok-san (Wuji-san in Chinese) <b>decoctions</b> produced {{using different}} extraction methods for variable times. <b>Decoctions</b> were extracted in pressurized or non-pressurized conditions for 60, 120, and 180 mins. We investigated the Ojeok-san extract yield, the total soluble solid content, the hydrogen ion concentration (pH), and the reference compound content. The extract yield {{and the total}} soluble solid content were higher in <b>decoctions</b> produced by non-pressurized extraction; both were proportional to the extraction time. The pH tended to decrease as the extraction time was increased in <b>decoctions</b> produced using both methods. After 60 and 180 mins, the levels of albiflorin, paeoniflorin, nodakenin, naringin, and neohesperidin were significantly higher in <b>decoctions</b> extracted using the non-pressurized method compared with those extracted using the pressurized method. After 120 mins, only cinnamaldehyde was extracted in a greater amount in pressurized <b>decoctions</b> compared with non-pressurized <b>decoctions.</b> The levels of paeoniflorin, ferulic acid, nodakenin, naringin, hesperidin, neohesperidin, and glycyrrhizin increased with time in non-pressurized <b>decoctions.</b> This study showed {{that the use of}} pressurized and non-pressurized extraction methods for different times affected the composition of Ojeoksan (Wuji-san) <b>decoctions...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{resistance}} of gastrointestinal nematodes to anthelmintics {{has increased the}} need to evaluate natural products that can replace or assist current strategies to control gastrointestinal nematodes. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of <b>decoctions</b> of Lantana camara (DLc), Alpinia zerumbet (DAz), Mentha villosa (DMv) and Tagetes minuta (DTm) on Haemonchus contortus by two in vitro tests. The effects of increasing concentrations of lyophilized <b>decoctions</b> (0. 31 to 10 mg/ml) were assessed using the egg hatch test (EHT). The <b>decoctions</b> were then tested in the larval artificial exsheathment assay. H. contortus third stage larvae (L 3) were exposed to 0. 31 mg/ml A. zerumbet and M. villosa <b>decoctions</b> and 0. 62 mg/ml T. minuta and L. camara <b>decoctions</b> for 3 h and then exsheathment procedure at 10 min intervals. An inhibitor of tannins, polyvinyl polypyrrolidone (PVPP), was used to study if tannins were responsible for the inhibitory effect on hatching and exsheathment of larvae. A. zerumbet, M. villosa and T. minuta showed a dose-dependent effect in the EHT, which did not disappear after the addition of PVPP. No effect was observed for L. camara in the EHT. However, the <b>decoctions</b> inhibited the process of larval exsheathment, which may be related to tannin action because the addition of PVPP reversed the inhibitory effect. A. zerumbet, M. villosa and T. minuta <b>decoctions</b> showed inhibitory activity on H. contortus larvae hatching and exsheathing. The <b>decoctions</b> of these plants could be used to control gastrointestinal nematodes following confirmation of their anthelmintic activity in vivo...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of Aster squamatus on gastrointestinal propulsion.

The <b>decoctions</b> of leaves, stalks and roots indicated the presence of caffeic, cinnamic, and sinapic acids. All A. squamatus infusions significantly reduced gastrointestinal propulsion compared to control, whereas the <b>decoctions</b> and ethanolic extracts did not alter this parameter. The effect of the infusions and the lack of activity of the <b>decoctions</b> and ethanolic extracts may be linked to the presence of unstable or volatile con-stituents in the plant...|$|R

5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium {{seeds and}} stems are edible {{and are used}} in {{traditional}} Native American cuisine by Alaska Natives, Inuit and Inupiat people. The leaves and roots of E.angustifolium are also edible and, because of their astringent properties, used by the Yupik peoples for medicinal purposes, {{through a process of}} <b>decoction,</b> infusion or poultice, to treat aliments of the human gastrointestinal tract, and in the Old World for the treatment of diarrhoea. In abundance, E.angustifolium can grow with enough density to disguise wetland and bog. Consequently, it may be used as a natural indicator of areas which are hazardous and to avoid travelling through. Attempts to make a cotton-like thread from the hairs of the plant's seed-heads have been thwarted by its brittleness, but it has been used in the production of paper and candle wicks in Germany, and was used as a feather substitute in pillow stuffing in Sweden and Sussex, England.

The present study evaluates {{the effects of these}} <b>decoctions</b> on fibrosis in rats induced by dimethylnitrosamine (DMN). Methods DMN solution (0. 5 %) was injected to rats for three consecutive days per week for four weeks. At the beginning of week 3, rats were randomly divided into 4 -week DMN control group, YCHT, XYXT, HQT, YGJ, XCHT and vehicle groups. Each group was orally administered with specific <b>decoctions</b> daily for two weeks. Rats in the vehicle group were orally administered with only water. Results Liver fibrosis and cirrhosis were observed in weeks 2 and 4 in DMN-intoxicated rats. Compared with normal rats, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities and level of total bilirubin acid (TBA) in serum and content of Hydroxyproline (Hyp) in liver tissue of model group rats rose significantly. However, the albumin (Alb) level in serum decreased significantly. Compared with the 4 -week DMN group, the pathological conditions and functions of the liver in the YCHT group improved significantly, and the content of Hyp decreased remarkably: only one rat in this group developed liver cirrhosis and the ratio of cirrhosis was only 8. 3 %. On the other hand, the other <b>decoctions</b> did not show remarkable effects. YCHT inhibited α-SMA activation, including its gene expression into mRNA and protein.
