5|$|In {{the wake}} of the Watergate scandal, Kennedy pushed {{campaign}} finance reform; he was a leading force behind passage of the Federal Election Campaign Act Amendments of 1974, which set contribution limits and established public financing for presidential elections. In April 1974, Kennedy travelled to the Soviet Union, where he met with leader Leonid Brezhnev and advocated a full nuclear test ban as well as relaxed emigration, gave a speech at Moscow State University, met with Soviet dissidents, and secured an <b>exit</b> <b>visa</b> for famed cellist Mstislav Rostropovich. Kennedy's Subcommittee on Refugees and Escapees continued to focus on Vietnam, especially after the Fall of Saigon in 1975.|$|E
5|$|West Germans {{were able}} {{to cross the border}} {{relatively}} freely to visit relatives, but had to go through numerous bureaucratic formalities. East Germans were subjected to far stricter restrictions. It was not until November 1964 that they were allowed to visit the West at all, and even then only pensioners were allowed. This gave rise to a joke that only in East Germany did people look forward to old age. Younger East Germans were not allowed to travel to the West until 1972, though few did so until the mid-1980s. They had to apply for an <b>exit</b> <b>visa</b> and passport, pay a substantial fee, obtain permission from their employer and undergo an interrogation from the police.|$|E
25|$|A {{foreign citizen}} granted a {{temporary}} residence permit in Russia needs a temporary resident visa to take a trip abroad (valid for both exit and return). It is also colloquially called an <b>exit</b> <b>visa.</b> Not all foreign citizens are subject to that requirement. Citizens of Germany, for example, do not require this <b>exit</b> <b>visa.</b>|$|E

50|$|In 1968, 231 Jews {{were granted}} <b>exit</b> <b>visas</b> to Israel, {{followed}} by 3,033 in 1969. From that point on, the USSR began granting <b>exit</b> <b>visas</b> in growing numbers. During the late 1960s and the 1970s, some 163,000 Soviet Jews emigrated to Israel; mostly between 1969 and 1973.|$|R

25|$|Some countries, {{including}} the Czech Republic, require that an alien {{who needs a}} visa on entry be {{in possession of a}} valid visa upon exit. To satisfy this formal requirement, exit visas sometimes need to be issued. Russia requires an <b>exit</b> <b>visa</b> if a visitor stays past the expiration date of their visa. They must then extend their visa or apply for an <b>exit</b> <b>visa</b> and are not allowed to leave the country until they show a valid visa or have a permissible excuse for overstaying their visa (e.g., a note from a doctor or a hospital explaining an illness, missed flight, lost or stolen visa). In some cases, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs can issue a Return-Home certificate that is valid for ten days from the embassy of the visitor's native country, thus eliminating the need for an <b>exit</b> <b>visa.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Exit</b> <b>visas</b> are {{required}} to leave Saudi Arabia. The U.S. Embassy or Consulates General cannot obtain <b>exit</b> <b>visas</b> for American citizens. Women must have permission from their husband or father to exit Saudi Arabia. The government of Saudi Arabia {{has been known to}} issue international arrest warrants against women who have taken their children from Saudi Arabia without the father's permission.|$|R
50|$|HIAS was {{involved}} {{from the beginning}} of the Jewish exodus from the USSR. In December 1966, HIAS organized a campaign to encourage American Jews to invite their Soviet relatives to join them in the U.S. The Soviet Union initially allowed limited <b>exit</b> <b>visas</b> to the U.S., though eventually, regardless of their final destination, Soviet Jews who received permission to emigrate were granted <b>exit</b> <b>visas</b> only to Israel.|$|R
50|$|Individual {{citizens}} of the Soviet Union who wanted to emigrate had to obtain <b>exit</b> <b>visas.</b> Many who sought <b>exit</b> <b>visas</b> were denied. Those who tried to escape the USSR and did not succeed were branded traitors, fired from their jobs, and became targets of public hatred. Those who received <b>exit</b> <b>visas</b> lost their Soviet citizenship and had to pay an exit tax. Under the Communist regime, real estate assets such as apartments usually belonged to the state, and emigrants had to cede those assets {{in the majority of}} cases. After the fall of the Soviet Union and the establishment of capitalism in Russia and other former Soviet republics, those laws were canceled. Emigrants who left Russia {{after the fall of the}} Soviet Union were able to keep their citizenship and assets.|$|R
25|$|Uzbekistan is {{the last}} {{remaining}} former USSR state that still requires an <b>exit</b> <b>visa,</b> which is valid for a two-year period. There has been explicit UN complaint about this practice.|$|E
25|$|Saudi Arabia and Qatar have an <b>exit</b> <b>visa</b> requirement, {{particularly}} for foreign workers. This {{is part of}} the kafala system, also present in Lebanon, Jordan, United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Kuwait, and Oman. Consequently, {{at the end of a}} foreign worker's employment period, the worker must secure clearance from their employer stating that the worker has satisfactorily fulfilled the terms of their employment contract or that the worker's services are no longer needed. The <b>exit</b> <b>visa</b> can also be withheld if there are pending court charges that need to be settled or penalties that have to be meted out.|$|E

5000|$|The war {{inspired}} the Jewish diaspora, which was {{swept up in}} overwhelming support for Israel. According to Michael Oren, the war enabled American Jews to [...] "walk with their backs straight and flex their political muscle as never before. American Jewish organizations which had previously kept Israel at arms length suddenly proclaimed their Zionism." [...] Record numbers of Jewish immigrants arrived from Western countries after the war, although {{many of them would}} later return to their countries of origin. Most notably, the war stirred Zionist passions among Jews in the Soviet Union, who had by that time been forcibly assimilated. Many Soviet Jews subsequently applied for <b>exit</b> <b>visas</b> and began protesting for their right to immigrate to Israel. Following diplomatic pressure from the West, the Soviet government began granting <b>exit</b> <b>visas</b> to Jews in growing numbers. From 1970 to 1988, some 291,000 Soviet Jews were granted <b>exit</b> <b>visas,</b> of whom 165,000 immigrated to Israel and 126,000 immigrated to the United States.|$|R
25|$|From 1948 until 1961, Israeli {{citizens}} {{required an}} <b>exit</b> <b>visa</b> {{as well as}} a passport to travel overseas even temporarily. Initially the intention was to prevent the departure of Jews who ought to be fighting, but also due to a perception that those leaving harmed national solidarity. After the war the restrictions were eased somewhat but still many administrative hurdles were put in front of those wishing to leave. To prevent the outflow of foreign currency, tickets could only be purchased with money sent from abroad. The general need for an <b>exit</b> <b>visa</b> was finally abolished in 1961 after several court cases and Knesset decisions.|$|E
25|$|During the Fascist {{period in}} Italy, an <b>exit</b> <b>visa</b> was {{required}} from 1922 to 1943. Nazi Germany required exit visas from 1933 to 1945. The Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies required exit visas both for emigration {{and for those}} who wanted to leave the USSR for a shorter period.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} of the People's Republic of China requires its citizens to obtain a Two-way Permit, issued by the PRC authorities, prior to their visit to the Chinese dependencies of Hong Kong or Macau. The Two-way Permit is a de facto <b>exit</b> <b>visa</b> for Hong Kong- or Macau-bound trips for PRC citizens.|$|E

5000|$|However, the Accords also {{included}} a provision on freedom of movement that was {{to lead to the}} regime's authority being increasingly undermined. As East German citizens learned about this provision - which was not publicised by the GDR's state-controlled media - an increasing number sought to use it to emigrate. They applied for <b>exit</b> <b>visas,</b> citing Helsinki in their applications. The numbers were relatively small at first, averaging around 7,200 first-time applications and the granting of 4,600 <b>exit</b> <b>visas</b> annually during the late 1970s. By the late 1980s numbers had snowballed to over 100,000 applications with around 15,000-25,000 <b>exit</b> <b>visas</b> being granted annually. Legal emigration posed a dilemma for the regime; although it provided a safety valve of sorts and allowed East Germany to portray itself as adhering to the Helsinki norms, it ran the risk of the East German population coming to demand a general right to emigrate. A Central Committee report prepared in 1988 warned that even Party members were not sufficiently motivated to oppose emigration: ...|$|R

25|$|The DPRK (North Korea) {{requires}} that its citizens obtain an <b>exit</b> <b>visa</b> stating the traveller's destination country {{and time to}} be spent abroad before leaving the country.

25|$|After {{spending}} {{the years between}} 1921 and 1922 living in primitive conditions, {{he decided to go}} back to France so that he could develop his art in a more comfortable country. Numerous other artists, writers, and musicians were also planning to relocate to the West. He applied for an <b>exit</b> <b>visa</b> and while waiting for its uncertain approval, wrote his autobiography, My Life.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{evidence}} that Magda attempted to intervene to save her Jewish stepfather from the Holocaust.

25|$|West and East Germans {{were treated}} very {{differently}} when entering or leaving East Germany. West Germans {{were able to}} cross the border relatively freely to visit relatives.

25|$|Sharansky {{was denied}} an <b>exit</b> <b>visa</b> to Israel in 1973.
