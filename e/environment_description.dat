40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{negotiation of}} bindings in QoS aware open systems {{and in particular}} how to characterize possible contracts, requirements and capabilities of heterogeneous environments. Our approach is (1) to use trading of policies as the principle for negotiation and (2) the use of declared or rule-based conformance for QoS statements {{to be used in}} negotiation and (3) a middleware binding framework supporting negotiable bindings. A policy is an architectural entity which encapsulates a potential QoS contract plus a resource and implementation configuration to enforce the contract. The contract part (profile) consists of an obligation to be matched with requirements and an expectation to be matched with <b>descriptions</b> of the <b>environment.</b> A policy may encapsulate how implementation components and properties of environments are combined to achieve a QoS level. Policy trading is the proposed principle for negotiation. Potential contracts may be orthogonal to interfaces and interface types, and are associated with some trading service. Negotiation is essentially to collect requirements and <b>environment</b> <b>descriptions</b> from participants and match these with policies. We investigate an approach to contract matching based on declared conformance. An important contribution is the development of a declarative expression language for profiles, requirement and <b>environment</b> <b>descriptions</b> used in negotiation at run-time. We propose to define conformance as rule bases. Such rule bases can be compiled to efficient conformance checking code. We propose two composition operators to combine expressions at run-time and develop the foundations of a generic conformance checking algorithm for profile expressions. A prototype binding framework is developed, supporting activation of bindings, pluggable binder and activator components. The framework is extended to support negotiation using policy trading and profile expressions. The approach is validated by examples and proof of concept implementations. A profile model compiler, a policy trader and the binding framework are implemented and applied to example applications...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{autonomous}} {{systems are}} challenged by complex, overwhelming computer processing power, though, time critical tasks. The basis for performing such tasks is a robust and comprehensive {{representation of the}} environment of the autonomous system, called world modeling. The world modeling sub-system is responsible for a representation of {{the current state of the}} environment, as well as a history of past states and forecasts for possible future states. The incoming sensory information is contaminated by uncertainties and, thus, is represented in form of probability distributions that can be treated by means of Degree-of-Belief (DoB). These DoB distributions are fused into existing <b>environment</b> <b>description</b> within the world modeling by statistical methods, e. g. Bayesian fusion. The history of past states allows for advanced information analysis, such as qualitative situation estimation. On the other hand, a direct analysis of the DoB distributions, for example, information entropy calculation, gives a quantitative estimation of situations. The future states can be predicted on the basis of known evolution parameters of the environment, i. e. by attributes and objects aging modeling. The qualitative and quantitative situation estimations, as well as the comprehensive <b>environment</b> <b>description</b> itself allows for permanent situation awareness and intelligent support for decision making sub-systems. In order to numerically estimate attribute sets of all modeling objects, the entropy calculation must be unified for both discrete and continuous DoB cases. In order to overcome the infinite discrepancy between the entropy of quantized and continuous random variables, the unification introduces a notion of the least discernible quantum (LDQ). The LDQ defines the utmost precision for any operation over the attribute...|$|E
