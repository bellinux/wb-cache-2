50|$|Toenailing or skew-nailing is {{a popular}} {{technique}} that carpenters use regularly to fix two timbers together by slanted application. The fasteners (nails or screws), used in pairs, are driven in on opposing angles. This locks the timbers together, to create a stable framework, e.g. in stud walls (partitions) or roof framing. The angled nailing makes later dismantling difficult or destructive. One {{of the most common}} places to toenail a <b>framing</b> <b>member</b> is where a rafter meets the top plate of a wall at the birdsmouth. Alternatives to toenailing include the use of hurricane ties, joist hangers, and other engineered steel connectors that permit nails to be attached perpendicular to a member's surface.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most notable}} building, which fronts on Third Street, is of Flemish design and {{is said to}} be {{patterned}} after a guild hall in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. It looks like typical old Dutch architecture. The Fourth Street and Ludlow Street facades are done in Italian Renaissance Revival with the Commercial Building anchoring the corner of the lot. The most interesting architectural feature is the great dome. The classic detailing usually found in such rotundas was replaced by detailing representative of Ohio. The cornucopias are filled with fruits and vegetables from Ohio. There are festoons of oak leaves with acorns, ram heads and garlands of grain. At each <b>framing</b> <b>member</b> of the dome are colorful turkeys.|$|E

40|$|International audienceDeep box-type beams, {{consisting}} of <b>framing</b> <b>members</b> and sheathings, {{are sensitive to}} shear deformations and hence appropriate refined theories or complicated magnification factors are needed {{to be used to}} obtain accurate results. For sheathings or webs between the <b>framing</b> <b>members</b> that are weak in shear, additional shear deformations occur corresponding to the relative axial displacement between the <b>framing</b> <b>members.</b> These sandwich -type or partial interaction-type of in-plane shear behaviour between the <b>framing</b> <b>members,</b> needs to be taken into account, especially when the web shear stiffness is very low. The composite box-type beam treated here is composed of three <b>framing</b> <b>members</b> with sheathings on both sides. To incorporate effects of the sheathings shear deformations between the <b>framing</b> <b>members</b> on the deflection, the sheathings, here called web interlayers, are modelled as shear media with equivalent slip moduli corresponding to a partially interacting composite beam model. Governing equilibrium equations of the model are obtained using the minimum total potential energy principle and solved explicitly. The obtained results are compared with those based on different conventional beam theories and 3 -D finite element (FE) simulations. It is shown that the model is capable of predicting accurately the deflection {{for a wide range of}} geometry and property parameters. It is demonstrated that the deflection of such deep box-type beams can be expressed as the summation of three different effects, namely bending deformations, conventional shear deformations in the <b>framing</b> <b>members</b> and sheathings, and additional in-plane shear deformations or shear slips of the weak web causing relative axial displacements between the <b>framing</b> <b>members...</b>|$|R

A closed carriage may have side windows called quarter lights (British) as well as windows in the doors, hence a [...] "glass coach". On the forepart of an open carriage, a screen of wood or leather called a dashboard intercepts water, mud or snow thrown up by the heels of the horses. The dashboard or carriage top sometimes has a projecting sidepiece called a wing (British). A foot iron or footplate may serve as a carriage step.|$|E

40|$|This book {{analyzes}} Italy’s {{policy toward}} European monetary integration from {{the creation of}} the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1957 to the final stage of Economic and Monetary Union in 1999 and the first five years thereafter. It is argued that “ideas,” in the form of “policy paradigms,” are crucial in <b>framing</b> <b>member</b> states’ trajectories in the European Union (EU) and they are therefore core components of the process of Europeanization. Policy paradigms need to be contextualized by considering the evolution of domestic institutions. According to the foreign policy paradigm that prevailed in Italy from the Second World War until the late 1990 s, “Europe” has been of paramount priority, which has been associated with its political, economic and cultural modernization. The economic policy paradigm, instead, has shifted from Keynesian economics in the 1960 s and 1970 s to the monetarist-inspired, stability-oriented paradigm of the 1980 s and 1990 s. The pro-European foreign policy paradigm explains why Italian policymakers decided to join all the European monetary initiatives, whereas the economic paradigm, which, for most of the time, was far apart from the stability-oriented paradigm embedded in European monetary regimes, explains Italy’s difficult adaptation. The book concludes by pointing out that the foreign policy paradigm has begun to shift since the late 1990 s...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2004 Presentation date: 2004 - 02 - 25 Service life {{prediction}} {{models for}} light-framed wood structures require an extensive quantity of empirical data on deterioration pathologies for the numerous structural components, {{as well as}} mechanistic approaches to determine their capacity at various levels of deterioration. The data and models presented in this study satisfy {{a portion of the}} information intensive requirements of service life prediction models and will be used for continued development of these models. This study investigated single-shear mechanical properties of three nailed connection geometries of biodeteriorated aspen oriented strand board (OSB) sheathing and Douglas-fir framing members, typical in light-framed lateral force resisting systems. Mechanical properties of the nailed connections including ultimate and yield strength, stiffness, and energy dissipation were evaluated at increasing levels of deterioration caused by the brown rot fungus, Postia placenta, through monotonic and quasi-static fully-reversed cyclic testing. The OSB sheathing specific gravity was the strongest explanatory variable for the mechanical properties examined and controlled the behavior of the connections at increasing levels of fungal damage. The data suggested that nailed connections in light-framed lateral force resisting systems can tolerate a moderate amount of fungal attack prior to significant loss of connection capacity. The connection yield mode transitioned from nail bending (mode IIIs) to side member crushing (mode Is) as the weight loss of the OSB sheathing approached 30 percent. Nominal design capacity and yield mode of nailed sheathing to <b>framing</b> <b>member</b> connections with fungal deterioration can be estimated using existing yield models for dowel-type connections through evaluation of the dowel bearing strength of the decay-damaged wood materials. Various physical, mechanical, and chemical properties of the OSB sheathing were monitored in a parallel study at increasing levels of fungal deterioration including dowel bearing strength, shear strength, weight loss, and solubility in an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH). These properties were strongly correlated with the OSB sheathing specific gravity. Near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, in combination with multivariate statistical methods, was used to develop predictive models for weight loss, shear strength, dowel bearing strength, and solubility. The NIR methods showed considerable promise as a field inspection tool based on the accuracy of models developed in this study...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{nonlinear}} hardening {{rule that}} describes a general yield surface change for <b>frame</b> <b>members</b> is proposed. The rule is valid for homogeneous materials and {{is defined by}} a nonlinear constitutive model. The model is given as the stress–strain relationship through the section thickness. The post-yield behavior of shear <b>frame</b> <b>members</b> is assessed using a hardening index parameter, a plastic strain coefficient, and a smooth and optimal mathematical function to model the geometry of structural wide-flange and tube sections. This enables a continuous distribution of post-yield curvatures to exist along the member length and results in accurate finite-element member displacement predictions. Steady-state hysteresis responses are determined for frame sections using the model’s nonlinearly degrading stiffness. The hardening rule is used to model the detailed material behavior of shear <b>frame</b> <b>members</b> that are subjected to lateral loads. The results of the model are validated through experimental published literature...|$|R

Six and fifteen stories flexural frames have plastic hinges more than X-braced frame. On the other hand in ODBS, more members are contributed in absorption of defined existing energy by nonlinear ductile behavior of plastic rotation and deformation proportional to flexural frame.
