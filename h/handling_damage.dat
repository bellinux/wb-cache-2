40|$|Today's fierce {{competition}} means that companies constantly must develop their business and internal processes. Focus on processes and continuous improvement {{is something that}} characterizes Lean Production which ICA logistics are applying with their concept Leading Logistics. Standardized routines for <b>handling</b> <b>damaged</b> gods were insufficient at the ICA distribution center in Kungälv. Handling and registration of damaged gods were not performed uniformly, resulting in problems with controlling and monitoring the process. The purpose of this thesis was to analyze and make recommendations how the process of internal <b>handling</b> of <b>damaged</b> gods could be improved. Therefore a comprehensive understanding was needed of the entire material flow through the warehouse and important quality aspects such as product safety and delivery reliability. The methods used are literature reviews, interviews and observations to produce a comprehensive process mapping of the current situation at the distribution center. Causes to why damaged gods occur were identified through process mapping and improvement meetings. Finally all input was analyzed which resulted in recommendations on how the process could be improved. Several unnecessary steps {{have been identified in}} the process of <b>handling</b> <b>damaged</b> goods and that the registration procedure sometimes resulted in incorrect inventory levels. Another problem was that several people make individual decisions regarding measures for damaged goods depending on how it occurred and was discovered. Important reasons identified to cause damage to the goods were poor packaging and rough handling. Another important aspect was that damages often became more severe in the actual <b>handling</b> of <b>damaged</b> goods. To improve the process of internal <b>handling</b> of <b>damaged</b> gods, ICA was recommended to take on a more proactive approach such as improving poor packaging. ICA was also recommended to prioritize early measures by restoring more goods directly when damage occurs. Quality should be seen as an integrated part of the core process and everyone should be involved and feel responsible for the quality. The report is written in Swedish...|$|R

One error-prone method option was to cut the tape with a razor blade. Since there was no visible frame line on the 2 in tape, a special ferrofluid developing solution was applied to the tape, allowing the editor to view the recorded control track pulse under a microscope, and thus determine where one frame ended and the next began. This process was not always exact, and if imperfectly performed would lead to picture breakup when the cut was played. Generally this process was used to assemble scenes together, not for creative editing.|$|E

The fibres were produced from identical melts following which bare fibre had only water applied to it before winding whereas the sized fibre had a solution containing only APS applied to its surface. Both fibre types experience a loss of room temperature tensile strength after exposure to elevated temperature. By application of a novel method of single fibre thermal conditioning it was demonstrated that the tensile strength of heat treated glass fibre can be significantly underestimated. Strength loss was found, in most cases, {{to be caused by}} a combination of thermal effect and mechanical <b>handling</b> <b>damage.</b> The latter is found to be influenced by thermal loading of the fibre. The onset of mechanical <b>handling</b> <b>damage</b> in APS sized fibre was found to be controlled by the thermal degradation of the silane sizing.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{optimise}} export quality of New Zealand avocados the New Zealand Avocado Industry Council Ltd sets guidelines for harvest conditions, which include rainfall.

However, the level of rainfall required to impact on susceptibility to <b>handling</b> <b>damage</b> and ripe fruit quality under field conditions has not been determined. Field experiments were conducted in the 2002 / 3 season to determine the impact of different amounts of rain in the 24 hours preceding harvest on both susceptibility to han-dling damage and ripe fruit quality. Experiments were timed to coincide with forecast rain follow-ing a dry period of 2 - 3 weeks. There were 3 trials carried out in October 2002, December 2002 and February 2003. In each trial a control sample of 200 fruit were collected prior to the forecast rain event. Half of these fruit were picked and placed directly into trays, while the remainder were jostled using a standardized procedure to simulate handling during the harvesting process. Further samples were then collected after various periods of rain, and a final sample at least 24 hours after it had ceased raining. Fruit were coolstored {{for a period of}} 28 days at 4 - 5 ºC, then ripened at 20 ºC and fruit quality assessed at eating ripeness.
