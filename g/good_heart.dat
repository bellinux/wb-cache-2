500|$|Rosa [...] "Miss Rosa" [...] Cisneros is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the Netflix dramedy series Orange Is the New Black, played by Barbara Rosenblat. The character made her first screen appearance during the premiere episode titled [...] "I Wasn't Ready", which aired on July 11, 2013. Stephanie Andujar portrayed [...] "Young Rosa" [...] in flashback sequences. Rosenblat originally auditioned for another character but producers {{asked her to}} portray Miss Rosa. The character is a cancer sufferer who is incarcerated in Litchfield federal prison because she committed armed bank robberies. Rosenblat {{did not want to}} shave her head for the role and a make-up artist was hired to fit a prosthetic appliance to her head creating the character's baldness. The application process took three hours, meaning that the actress had to arrive on set earlier than other cast members. Initially there was no character biography created for Miss Rosa and it was Rosenblat who implemented a Hispanic background and accent. The character is respected amongst fellow inmates and despite her criminal past she has a caring nature and <b>good</b> <b>heart.</b>|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} {{the death of}} Jeremy Davies character Daniel Faraday. Daniel {{was introduced in the}} fourth season and was originally intended to be a minor character only. However, his quiet demeanor and seemingly <b>good</b> <b>heart</b> made him a favorite with the fans, so Lindelof and Cuse decided to expand Daniel's role, which has led to him being a key player in Losts eventual resolution. In response to Daniel's death, Cuse said, [...] "It was an incredibly painful thing to kill this beloved character, but we feel that’s what this show has to do. His death is kind of the culminating event in the entire season. It really ends one chapter and commences the start of the final chapter of the entire series." [...] Once the show runners explained that to Davies, he was saddened that his full-time status on Lost was coming to an end, but put the story [...] "above his own personal self". Damon seconded Carlton's emotions, adding that Jeremy took the news well: [...] "When Carlton and I called Jeremy to explain what was going to be happening with Daniel, we’ve never had a more awesome exit interview with somebody on the show. For us, Daniel really was the cornerstone of the fifth season – he really shined. I can’t imagine what Season 5 would have looked like without Jeremy Davies. When you think about all the crazy stuff that had to come out of that guy’s mouth, for him to be as interesting and emotional and poetic as he was is really extraordinary." [...] The cast of the show said Davies would be missed, though he may not be done with Lost — Carlton commented that Jeremy's [...] "full-time" [...] status was over, but dead characters have been known to reappear on the show. Michael Emerson, who plays Ben, said Davies was [...] "a great sensitive guy who got deep into his character, he really lived it." ...|$|E
