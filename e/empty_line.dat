40|$|Introducing the {{algorithm}} strategy prematurely without sufficient understanding of numbers {{could lead to}} student’s innumeracy, while constructing mental arithmetic strategies in a realistic approach is suggested as an alternative. Furthermore, an <b>empty</b> number <b>line</b> {{is found to be}} a powerful model to do mental arithmetic strategies flexibly. Therefore, the present research attempts to answer the question about the development of student’s learning process in constructing mental arithmetic strategies on an <b>empty</b> number <b>line</b> to solve addition problems. The question was answered by taking into account a design research methodology with two underpinning theories, i. e. (1) the Realistic Mathematics Education theory as a guide to develop a local instruction theory in a specific mathematical domain; and (2) the socio-constructivist analysis of instruction in which student’s learning processes were viewed from both the individual and the social perspective. The result shows that the use of context, model, students’ active contributions, {{and the role of the}} teacher could enhance students thinking in developing mental arithmetic strategies on an <b>empty</b> number <b>line.</b> However, an <b>empty</b> number <b>line</b> could also become meaningless for the development of student’s mental arithmetic strategies when the significance of number relations is forgotten in the classroom discussion.
