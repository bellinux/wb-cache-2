Previous work has exploited this result to yield expressions for the relative variance of {{the energy of the}} response of a random system to harmonic excitation. The derivation of these expressions employed random point process theory, and in the theoretical development it was assumed that the modal <b>generalised</b> <b>forces</b> were uncorrelated.

40|$|Typically, {{we think}} of both {{artificial}} and natural computing devices as following rules {{that allow them to}} alter their behaviour (output) according to their environment (input). This approach works well when the environment and goals are well defined and regular. However, 1) the search time for appropriate solutions quickly becomes intractable when the input is not fairly regular, and 2) responses may be required that are not computable, either in principle, or given the computational resources available to the system. It may seem {{that there is no way}} to deal with these conditions, but if {{we think of}} systems as dynamical non-equilibrium autonomous entities, there are ways to deal with the unexpected and irregular by taking advantage of self-organising and self-preserving capacities of such systems. A <b>generalised</b> <b>force</b> acting on a system far from equilibrium will cause the system to reorganise itself in the direction of the <b>generalised</b> <b>force</b> in such a way as to minimise its effects (Nicolis and Prigogine, 1977), but there can be unpredictable effects in different generalised directions in the systems phase space. In order to preserve system integrity, these effects must be damped or used for further self-reorganisation, possibly starting a cascade effect that leaves the system in a substantially different state in which it can handle further instances of this sort of information.

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the control design problem of {{positioning}} of over-actuated underwater vehicles. The proposed design {{is based on}} a control architecture with combined position and velocity loops and a control tuning method based on the decoupled models. We derive analytical tuning rules based on requirements of closed-loop stability, positioning performance, and the vehicle velocity dynamic characteristics. The vehicle modelling is considered from force to motion with appropriate simplifications related to low-speed manoeuvring hydrodynamics and vehicle symmetry. The control design is considered together with a control allocation mapping. This approach makes the control tuning independent of the characteristics of the force actuators and provides the basis for control reconfiguration in the presence of actuator failure. We propose an anti-wind-up implementation of the controller, which ensures that the constraints related to actuation capacity are not violated. This approach simplifies the control allocation problem since the actuator constraints are mapped into <b>generalised</b> <b>force</b> constraints...|$|E

40|$|The {{unsteady}} Vortex Lattice {{method is}} becoming an increasingly popular aerodynamic modelling method for incompressible aeroelastic problems, such as flexible low-speed aircraft, wind turbines and flapping flight. It leads to discrete time aeroelastic state space equations, which must be solved in a time-marching framework. Eigenvalue or singular value decompositions of the discrete time equations {{can be used in}} order to perform stability analysis but such procedures must be accompanied by model order reduction because the size of the equations is large. This work proposes a modal frequency domain implementation of the Vortex Lattice method, resulting in a modal <b>generalised</b> <b>force</b> matrix. Model order reduction is implicit in the modal approach and stability analysis can be carried out using industry-standard flutter analysis techniques, such as the p-k method. The approach is validated by comparison to wind tunnel flutter data obtained from rectangular cantilever flat plate wings of different aspect ratios and sweep angles. It is found that the aeroelastic model predictions follow the experimental trends for both flutter speed and frequency but tend to be moderately conservative. Peer reviewe...|$|E

The full thermal behaviour of the model is found and we discuss how non-analytic behaviour emerges in the combined limits of zero temperature and perfect reflection. Finally we discuss the possibility of a <b>generalised</b> <b>force</b> conjugate to the reflection coefficients of the interacting materials and how, if the materials involved were susceptible to changing their reflective properties, this would tend to enhance the Casimir attraction.

Coordination number is identified as a discriminating characteristic, and for rough-surfaced particles we show that the low values predicted are indeed approached in simple two dimensional experiments.

These constraints can in turn {{be related to the}} <b>generalised</b> <b>forces</b> conjugate to the motion of grains rolling over each other.

40|$|The {{kinematics}} of a robot manipulator {{are described}} in terms of the mapping connecting its joint space and the 6 -dimensional Euclidean group of motions SE(3).

40|$|In the {{high-frequency}} range, {{there have}} been advances {{in the use of}} non-parametric uncertainty models to predict the vibration response of uncertain structures. In particular, the Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) approach has been combined with the Random Point Process Theory (RPPT) to yield the non-parametric ensemble variance of the subsystem energies without requiring Monte Carlo Simulations (MCS) to be performed to propagate the uncertainty. The assumptions behind the RPPT are that the <b>generalised</b> <b>forces</b> acting on a single subsystem and the mode shapes (computed at the points where the forces are applied) are statistically independent and identically distributed. These assumptions are valid for a large variety of cases; however, it has been found that correlation effects can {{have a significant effect on}} the response variance in some cases, particularly when the modal overlap is high. In this paper, the correlation effects are quantified for the case of a system driven by multiple random point loads.

40|$|This thesis aims to {{complete}} {{our understanding of}} the interface of a liquid-vapour system. While the intermolecular arrangements of one-phase liquid and vapour systems have been previously determined by others, the detailed and complete intermolecular arrangement of the interfacial region of a liquid-vapour system has not yet been determined completely. The numerical technique used to study the intermolecular structure of the liquid-vapour interface is molecular dynamics simulation and the calculations are focussed on a Lennard-Jones fluid. For this purpose, a new type of boundary condition the shifted reflective boundary is developed. It is shown that this boundary condition creates a fixed undisturbed single planar interface allowing the detailed study of the intermolecular arrangement of the fluid particles at the interface. Next, a complete rigourous derivation of the <b>generalised</b> <b>forces</b> associated with rectangular systems in terms of boundary and virial formulations is made, whereby the boundary conditions delimiting the system are explicitly taken into account. Special emphasis is laid on the physical interpretation of the mathematical expressions resulting from the derivation.

40|$|Summary. [...] -A {{numerical}} {{method is}} given for calculating the lifting forces on oscillating wings of any plan-form. The principles and techniques of Multhopp's subsonic theory {{have been applied}} to the supersonic problem resulting in a single basic theory which embraces both subsonic and supersonic cases. One {{of the most important}} features of the method is the careful choice of the points at which the lift and downwash distributions are measured. The position of these points in the chordwise direction depend upon whether the local leading and trailing edges are subsonic or supersonic. Extensive use has been made of various interpolation functions which simplify the evaluation of the integrals required for both the downwash and the <b>generalised</b> <b>forces.</b> In the latter case it is shown that the continuous lift distribution can be replaced without loss of accuracy by a set of concentrated lift forces at the lift points. The lift distribution is expressed in terms of these discrete forces since for most purposes they are more convenient to use. It is shown that control surfaces can be dear with by using equivalent continuous deflections and downwash angles to replace the true discontinuous values. Simple expressions are given for these equivalent values, and these expressions are applicable to both subsonic and supersonic cases. 1. Introductiora.
