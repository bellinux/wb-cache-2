Although Thomas McClatchie and James Legge had both translated the text in the 19th century, the text gained significant traction during the counterculture of the 1960s, with the translations of Wilhelm and John Blofeld attracting particular interest.

Suddenly, on a flat road, Anquetil lost contact and a gap of three lengths appeared between the two partners.

Altig was riding at 30mph at the front — and had been doing so for 15 minutes. When Anquetil lost contact, he had to ease the pace, wait for his partner to go by, push him powerfully in the back, sprint to the front again after losing 10 yards in the process, and again settle down to a 30mph stint at the front.

25|$|The castle's {{strategic}} location, which affords {{a view of}} much {{of southern}} Lebanon and northern Israel, has caused {{it to be a}} focus for recent conflicts. The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) held the castle from 1976 onwards, during the Lebanese Civil War and consequentially it was attacked <b>dozens</b> <b>of</b> <b>times</b> by Israeli forces in the space of five years. On 6 June 1982, at the start of Operation Peace for Galilee (the 1982 Lebanon War), the PLO position on Beaufort Castle was heavily shelled by the Israelis before it was captured by the Israeli forces two days later in the Battle of the Beaufort. The fighting caused damage to the castle, and in the aftermath the Israeli army adapted the site for their own use by building a large forward operations base adjacent to the fort's western wall - as a result of prior presence of PLO and the fear of IEDs, Israeli soldiers manning the base were allowed to tour the upper floors of the fortress but prevented from accessing the lower parts. In 2000 the Israeli army left Beaufort, altogether demolishing the base. The IDF occupation of Beaufort provides the basis of the Israeli film Beaufort, although the film itself was shot on the Golan Heights. After the Israeli withdrawal attempts by local tourism services to restore the fort began, albeit in very slow progress and lack of funding.|$|E
40|$|The {{probability}} of W-boson decay into a lepton and a neutrino {{in a strong}} electromagnetic field is calculated. On {{the basis of the}} method for deriving exact solutions to relativistic wave equations for charged particles, an exact analytic expression is obtained for the partial W-decay width at an arbitrary value of the external field strength. It is found that, in the region of comparatively weak fields, field-induced corrections to the standard decay width of the W-boson in a vacuum are about a few percent. In these conditions at first we observe the decrease of the W-boson partial decay width with the increase of the external field strength parameter. At absolute minimum the W-width deviates from the corresponding vacuum value by a factor 0, 926. Then with further augmentation of the background field intensity the W-boson decay width grows monotonously.

Rev. Meredith oversaw the training of John Bell Tilden Reed, whom Bishop Meade ordained as a deacon on March 17, 1861 and who took care of the parish's spiritual needs in Meredith's absence, with the help of visiting clergy including Rev. Henderson Suter of Grace Church in Berryville, Rev. Thompson B. Maury and several other Confederate chaplains and others. Deacon J.B.T. Reed, already a mature man and active Mason as well as son of a Methodist minister, never was ordained a priest, but at the war's end initiated young Union Major William McKinley into Winchester's Hiram Lodge of Masons, as well as himself served as a missionary in various nearby churches before his death at age 89 in 1895. The parish's wardens were both Confederate sympathizers and law partners, Philip Williams and David Barton. The former was arrested by the Union army in 1864 and imprisoned in Wheeling, West Virginia. The latter lost three of his six sons who enlisted in the Confederate cause before dying himself in 1863.

From 1987 to 1993, he was studying at Kaunas 4th Middle School. His first trip destination was Moscow, which he visited before the tournament. Jasikevičius's greatest youth memory in the city was the opening of the first McDonald's in Russia. He remembers that his classmates were listening with their mouths gaping when he was narrating about the French fries, bread rolls with minced beef and fizzy drinks. One of his childhood passions was history, especially about the Native Americans, as well as books about basketball as he was capable of reading a book of more than four hundred pages on basketball in two days. He was also curious about politics, especially when Perestroika began, because of which he was able to travel to Berlin with his father and brother, and was amazed by the visit to the Checkpoint Charlie Museum. His childhood favorite Lithuanian player was Arvydas Sabonis, which he admired more than other Lithuanian superstars, such as Rimas Kurtinaitis and Valdemaras Chomičius, due to his passing. However, his idol was Dražen Petrović, and he wished to be as good as him, watching matches of him over and over again, <b>dozens</b> <b>of</b> <b>times,</b> for hours and hours, and later started imitating him in workouts. After one of his trips, his dad came back with a videocassette recorder, using which he was able to record an NBA All-Star Game with Michael Jordan, Clyde Drexler, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, David Robinson, and later to watch it for couple of years, more than hundred times. Jasikevičius also started to record games of Žalgiris and Petrović every time he was able to. Thanks to the video recorder, he discovered the existence of a no-look pass of Magic Johnson. For him, he was the NBA, not Michael Jordan. His unselfishness, imagination and the way he dribbled, passed between his opponent's legs bewitched Jasikevičius. Consequently, his favorite element of basketball quickly became assisting his teammates, and he was trying to do it like Petrović or Johnson.|$|E

Explosive loading is, in most cases, local in nature, {{although it can}} exceed the loads for which buildings are designed by a <b>dozen</b> <b>of</b> <b>times.</b> The analysis <b>of</b> terrorist attacks with explosives employed demonstrates that charges have a great power and, consequently, a substantial shock wave pressure. Blast effects are predictable with a certain probability. Therefore, we cannot discuss the no-failure operation of individual structures. The estimated reliability of buildings is a more important problem. That's how we can save lives {{of those people who}} are outside of the area impacted by an explosion. Explosive loading is a variable random process influenced by a variety of factors, including the charge geometry, weight, etc. A shock wave can be reflected from surfaces and objects. Reference data concerning physical properties of models of explosives are provided in various sources. That's why we can talk about the blast load value with some probability. The article deals with the probability modeling of the shock wave pressure. The charge weight is chosen as a random parameter that has a normal Gauss distribution. Any structural design must be backed by reliable and verified calculations and mathematical models based on advanced high-speed PCs and software. The finite element software package ANSYS/LS-DYNA was employed to complete this research. The problem was solved in the time domain through the employment of the fourth integration of equations of motion.
