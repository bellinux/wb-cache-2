Some common uses for these are in the Tire Industry for stacking tire inventory. Most of these systems span 50-60 ft in width and average 200-300 feet in length. These systems use End Effectors a.k.a. <b>End</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arm</b> <b>Tooling</b> to pick and place the tire stacks from conveyors.|$|E
40|$|Use of robotic {{arms and}} {{computer}} vision in manufacture, and assembly process {{are getting more}} interest as flexible customization is becoming priority over mass production as frontier industry practice. In this paper an innovative label applicator as <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>arm</b> <b>tooling</b> (EOAT) capable of dispensing and applying label stickers of various dimensions to a product is designed, fabricated and tested. The system incorporates a label dispenserapplicator and had eye-in-hand camera system, attached to 6 -dof robot arm can autonomously apply a label sticker {{to the target position}} on a randomly placed product. Employing multiple advantages from different knowledge basis, mechanism design and vision based automatic control, offers this system distinctive efficiency as well as flexibility to change in manufacturing and assembly process with time and cost saving...|$|E
40|$|Today’s {{automotive}} {{manufacturing facilities}} use different robotic systems with the specifically designed <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>arm</b> <b>tooling</b> (EOAT). Regardless of how accurate these robotic systems may be, they are programmed {{to repeat the}} same task {{and move to the}} same position repeatedly. As convenient as this process may be, it does not allow robots to automatically readjust to different part variations without the human assistance. This situation is especially noticeable in the plastics manufacturing industry, e. g., fuel tank welding. This thesis describes the systematic design methodology of an adaptable tooling system for a part to part variations processing aimed at automotive plastic fuel tank manufacturing. By combining a 3 D vision system with a PLC, and a Fanuc R- 2000 iB/ 165 F 6 axis robot, the system provides the robot with the ability to automatically readjust the processing unit to different part variations. The design approach specifies programming and device correlation by using Siemens S 7, Fanuc TP, and SICK AG software. A case study using a fuel tank sample was developed to check the system for functionality and performance. Results of the study indicate that the system is accurate within ± 0. 25 mm, which is well suited for fuel tank manufacturing. The study signifies a new approach to vision guided robotics (VGR). It utilizes existing equipment for applications where part variation may be present. Three patent applications were published {{during the course of this}} research. They each cover plastic fuel tank welding applications...|$|E

[...] Both conventional and robotic palletizers can receive product at a high elevation (typically between 84” - 2.13m to 124” - 3.15m) or low “floor level” elevation (typically at 30” - 0.76m to 36” - 0.91m).|$|R

The present investigation is concerned with various <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>arm</b> <b>tool</b> concepts which could augment the RMS's capability enabling it to perform functions such as pushing/holding (applying pressure), prying, clamping (nonimpulse release) and shearing. Attention is also given to a tool for satellite servicing, a method for augmenting the operator's 'feel' for the job by force/moment sensing, and a possible four phase program for implementation of the tool system. A description is given of the key elements of RMS flight testing carried out to date...|$|R
