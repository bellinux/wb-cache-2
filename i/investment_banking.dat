5|$|The {{acquisition}} of S.G. Warburg & Co., a leading British <b>investment</b> <b>banking</b> firm, in 1995 {{for the price}} of US$1.4billion signified a major push into <b>investment</b> <b>banking.</b> S.G. Warburg & Co. had established a reputation as a daring merchant bank that grew {{to be one of the}} most respected investment banks in London. However, a Warburg expansion into the U.S. had turned out flawed and costly, and talks in 1994 with Morgan Stanley about a merger had collapsed. SBC merged the firm with its own existing <b>investment</b> <b>banking</b> unit to create SBC Warburg.|$|E

5|$|In March 2007, Moelis {{announced}} that he was leaving the company, and shortly thereafter founded a new business, Moelis & Company. As he had when joining UBS, Moelis took a large team of senior UBS investment bankers. Moelis's departure was caused primarily by repeated conflict over the availability of capital from the bank's balance sheet to pursue large transactions, particularly leveraged buyouts. The bank's apparent conservatism would be turned on its head when large losses were reported in various mortgage securities rather than corporate loans that generated <b>investment</b> <b>banking</b> fees. After Moelis, other notable departures included <b>investment</b> <b>banking</b> co-head Jeff McDermott in early 2007 and, as the financial crisis set in, other high-profile bankers such as Oliver Sarkozy in early 2008 and Ben Lorello in 2009.|$|E

40|$|We examine {{investment}} banks' {{networking function}} in capital markets, using {{a sample of}} Private Investments in Public Equity (PIPEs). We argue that <b>investment</b> <b>banks</b> develop relationships with investors through repeat dealings, and that investment banks' networks of relationship investors {{form the basis of}} their networking function. We find that <b>investment</b> <b>banks,</b> especially those with larger investor networks, help issuers attract investors. Correspondingly, an issuer that desires more investors is more likely to hire an <b>investment</b> <b>bank</b> than place the shares directly. We also find that issuers pay higher fees to hire <b>investment</b> <b>banks</b> with larger investor networks.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2007, UBS became the first Wall Street firm to announce a heavy loss in the subprime mortgage sector as the subprime mortgage crisis began to develop.

This 15-percent staff cut would make overall staff count come down from 63,745 to 54,000. (For comparison, the peak employment level in 2007 before the 2008 financial crisis was 83,500.)

50|$|The core {{activities}} of <b>investment</b> <b>banks</b> {{are subject to}} regulation and monitoring by central banks and other government institutions - {{but it has been}} common practice for <b>investment</b> <b>banks</b> to conduct many of their transactions in ways that do not show up on their conventional balance sheet accounting and so are not visible to regulators or unsophisticated investors. For example, prior to the 2007-2012 financial crisis, <b>investment</b> <b>banks</b> financed mortgages through off-balance sheet (OBS) securitizations (e.g. asset-backed commercial paper programs) and hedged risk through off-balance sheet credit default swaps. Prior to the 2008 financial crisis, major <b>investment</b> <b>banks</b> were subject to considerably less stringent regulation than depository <b>banks.</b> In 2008, <b>investment</b> <b>banks</b> Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs became bank holding companies, Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns were acquired by bank holding companies, and Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy, essentially bringing the largest <b>investment</b> <b>banks</b> into the regulated depository sphere.|$|R
