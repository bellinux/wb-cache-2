50|$|The <b>Eastern</b> <b>Racer</b> (Coluber constrictor) is {{a species}} of non-venomous, {{colubrid}} snake. They are primarily found throughout the United States, east of the Rocky Mountains, but they range north into Canada, and south into Mexico, Guatemala and Belize. Racers typically grow to around 3½ foot (107 cm) long, but some subspecies are capable of attaining lengths of 6 feet (1.8 m). Their patterns vary widely between subspecies. Most are solid colored as their common names imply, black racers, brown racers, blue racers or green racers. Runner is sometimes used instead of racer in their common name.|$|E
50|$|There {{is a great}} {{conservation}} {{concern for}} snake population in the Eastern United States due SFD caused by O. ophiodiicola. Confirmed cases of SFD {{have been reported in}} nine states in USA though the disease is believed to be more widespread than has been documented. Multiple species of snakes that are affected including the Northern water snake (Nerodia sipedon), <b>eastern</b> <b>racer</b> (Coluber constrictor), rat snake (Pantherophis obsoletus species complex), timber rattlesnake (Crotalus horridus), massasauga (Sistrurus catenatus), pygmy rattlesnake (Sistrurus miliarius), and milk snake (Lampropeltis triangulum). It is reported that population of rattlesnake in New Hampshire reduced to 19 from 40 due to SFD caused by O.ophiodiicola.|$|E

Species {{that are likely to}} use the refuge but are not documented include ringneck snake (Diadophis punctatus), milk snake (Lampropeltis triangulum), northern water snake (Nerodia sipedon), brown snake (Storeria dekayi, Maine Special Concern), Blanding's turtle (Emydoidea blandingii, Maine Endangered), and possibly, <b>eastern</b> <b>racer</b> (Coluber constrictor, Maine— Endangered), wood turtle (Clemmys insculpta, Maine—Special Concern) and common musk turtle (Sternotherus odoratus). Records indicate that both Blanding’s turtle and spotted turtle occur in many locations along the refuge boundary. Wood turtle and black racer records are much less common, and musk turtle records {{in the vicinity of the}} refuge are nonexistent. Surveys targeted at detecting turtles and snakes could be developed and implemented on refuge lands with particular attention to the occurrence of the rare, secretive Blanding’s turtle. Lands within the proposed acquisition boundary in Kennebunk and Biddeford have extensive vernal pool habitat that would benefit several Species of Concern.|$|E
50|$|The diverse habitat {{supports}} diverse wildlife: There are 239 bird species, 42 {{species of}} mammal, {{and at least}} eight species of reptile, including rattlesnake, bull Snake, <b>Eastern</b> Yellowbelly <b>Racer,</b> and various lizards.|$|R

5000|$|Adult <b>eastern</b> <b>racers</b> can {{typically}} {{vary from}} 50 to 152 cm in total length {{depending on the}} subspecies, but a record-sized specimen measured 185.4 cm in total length. A typical adult specimen will weigh around 556 g, with little size difference between the sexes. The patterns vary widely between subspecies. Most are solid-colored as their common names imply: black racers, brown racers, tan racers, blue racers, or green racers. [...] "Runner" [...] is sometimes used instead of [...] "racer" [...] in their common names. All subspecies have a lighter-colored underbelly: white, light tan, or yellow in color. Juveniles are more strikingly patterned, with a middorsal row of dark blotches on a light ground color. The tail is unpatterned. As they grow older, the dorsum darkens and the juvenile pattern gradually disappears.|$|R
40|$|The Platte River {{in central}} Nebraska, USA, was {{historically}} surrounded by mixed grass and tallgrass prairies and wet meadows, {{but many of}} those habitats were lost or altered during the last century with unknown effects on animals that reside in them. Researchers first surveyed herpetofauna on {{part of a large}} island preserve in the Platte River, Mormon Island, Hall County, Nebraska, in 1980 when the land was protected for conservation. They documented 10 species, including three species of amphibians and seven species of reptiles. We inventoried herpetofauna after 30 years of conservation management on Mormon Island and adjacent Shoemaker Island. We captured four species of amphibians and 11 species of reptiles, including five species not detected in the previous survey. New species documented on the preserve were the Bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus), <b>Eastern</b> <b>Racer</b> (Coluber constrictor), Smooth Green Snake (Liochlorophis vernalis), Redbelly Snake (Storeria occipitomaculata), and Lined Snake (Tropidoclonion lineatum). Smooth Green Snakes represent a new county record, and Redbelly Snakes represent the easternmost published distributional limit for this disjunct population in central Nebraska. Documentation of additional snake species likely reflects a more intensive trapping regime and possibly habitat changes since 1980. Presence of Bullfrogs on Mormon Island probably was linked to excavation of a backwater slough that created a site for overwintering tadpoles. Herein we describe the variable life-history characteristics, habitats, and seasonal activity patterns among these 15 species of herpetofauna on the large river islands. We also discuss how restoration activities and hydrologic changes may influence the presence and abundance of herpetofauna in the region. Understanding the occurrence, habitat use, and seasonality of amphibians and reptiles in this topographically unaltered (i. e., unplowed) reach of river will aid in managing the central Platte River ecosystem to protect and maintain its biological integrity for all organisms...|$|E
40|$|During {{fieldwork}} for the Vermont Reptile and Amphibian Atlas Project, {{a population}} of <b>Eastern</b> <b>Racers</b> (Coluber constrictor) was found utilizing a parcel of state land managed by the Vermont Agency of Transportation (VTrans) in southeastern Vermont along Interstate 91.

40|$|We {{conducted}} {{a study of the}} amphibian, reptile, and small mammal community assemblage of Ozark pocket gopher (Geomys bursarius ozarkensis) habitat in north-central Arkansas. We used 2 methods to capture individuals: hand capture and drift fences. During the study, we captured and marked a total of 9 anuran, 4 salamander, 5 lizard, 3 turtle, 16 snake, and 8 small mammal species exclusive of pocket gophers. We found one hatchling three-toed box turtle (Terrapene carolina triunguis) and one rough earth snake (Virginia striatula) inside a pocket gopher burrow and mound, respectively. Additionally, we witnessed both <b>eastern</b> <b>racers</b> (Coluber constrictor) and eastern coachwhips (Masticophis flagellum) retreat into pocket gopher burrows, as well as Hurter’s spadefoots (Scaphiopus holbrookii hurterii) burrow into pocket gopher mounds when released. Our results highlight the importance of mammalian burrows, specifically pocket gophers, to other vertebrate associates in grassland ecosystems. Both conservationists and managers need to determine the pocket gopher’s impact on ecosystem health and viability, specifically in natural grasslands, before conservation and/or management strategies are employed...|$|R

50|$|The western yellow-bellied racer (Coluber {{constrictor}} mormon), {{also known}} as the western yellowbelly racer, or western racer, is a snake species endemic to Western United States, including California, Oregon, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado. It is a subspecies of the racer. It is nonvenomous, and is recognized by its long and very slender shape. It is visually similar to the <b>eastern</b> yellowbelly <b>racer,</b> which is also green, blue or brown with a yellow recognizable underbelly. Also named for its color, the Western Yellowbelly Racer is also gray with red or brown blotches when young.|$|R
5000|$|... ==Description== The <b>eastern</b> yellowbelly <b>racer</b> is a thin-bodied snake, {{capable of}} {{attaining}} a total length of 1.5 metres (60 inches).

The color gradually changes as the snake ages, becoming solid olive grey-green. Authors disagree as to when this transformation is complete, from 1½ to three years old, and from 18 to 30 inches (46-76 cm) in total length.|$|R
50|$|Painted {{buntings}} {{are mostly}} monogamous and are solitary or in pairs during the breeding season, but sometimes exhibit polygyny. The breeding season begins in late April and lasts through to early August, with activity peaking mid-May through to mid-July. The male arrives {{about a week}} before the female and starts to establish a small territory. The nest is typically hidden in low, dense vegetation and is built by the females and woven into the surrounding vegetation for strength. Each brood contains three or four gray-white eggs, often spotted with brown, which are incubated for around 10 days until the altricial young are hatched. The female alone cares for the young. The hatchlings are brooded for approximately 12 to 14 days and then fledge at that time. About 30 days after the first eggs hatch, the female painted bunting usually lays a second brood. Nests are often parasitized by cowbirds. Common predators at the nest of eggs, young, and brooding females are large snakes, including coachwhip snakes, <b>eastern</b> kingsnakes, <b>eastern</b> <b>racers</b> and black rat snakes. Bird-hunting raptors, including short-tailed hawks, Accipiter hawks, and even the small passerine loggerhead shrike, may hunt painted buntings, including the conspicuous breeding-plumaged male. The painted bunting can live to over 10 years of age, though most wild buntings probably live barely half that long.|$|R

40|$|On the North American Great Plains, several snake species {{reach their}} {{northern}} range limit where {{they rely on}} sparsely distributed hibernacula located in major river valleys. Independent colonization histories for the river valleys and barriers to gene flow caused {{by the lack of}} suitable habitat between them may have produced genetically differentiated snake populations. To test this hypothesis, we used 10 microsatellite loci to examine the population structure of two species of conservation concern in Canada: the <b>eastern</b> yellow-bellied <b>racer</b> (Coluber constrictor flaviventris) and bullsnake (Pituophis catenifer sayi) in 3 major river valleys in southern Saskatchewan. Fixation indices (FST) showed that populations in river valleys were significantly differentiated for both species (racers, FST = 0. 096, P = 0. 001; bullsnakes FST = 0. 045 - 0. 157, P = 0. 001). Bayesian assignment (STRUCTURE) and ordination (DAPC) strongly supported genetically differentiated groups in the geographically distinct river valleys. Finer-scale subdivision of populations within river valleys was not apparent based on our data, but is a topic that should be investigated further. Our findings highlight the importance of major river valleys for snakes at the northern extent of their ranges, and raise the possibility that populations in each river valley may warrant separate management strategies...|$|R

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of BiologyKimberly A. WithThe loss, fragmentation, and {{degradation}} of grasslands {{have resulted in}} widespread declines in grassland birds. Nest predation {{is the leading cause}} of avian reproductive failure; therefore minimizing nest predation can lessen the severity of bird declines. Snakes are important predators of bird nests, but little is known about how snakes may enhance predation risk. To address this issue, I studied the habitat use, movement behavior, population genetic structure, and connectivity of snakes in the grasslands of northeastern Kansas. I addressed the connectivity of <b>eastern</b> yellowbelly <b>racer</b> (Coluber constrictor flaviventris) populations by using a landscape genetics approach at a broad scale (13, 500 km 2). I also radio-tracked the yellowbelly racer and Great Plains ratsnake (Pantherophis emoryi) at Konza Prairie Biological Station to understand their spatial ecology while simultaneously evaluating nest survival in grassland birds. Individual racers had limited dispersal (< 3 km), but substantial admixture occurred within 30 km and populations were in migration-drift equilibrium and had high allelic diversity; therefore, racers must be abundant and continuously distributed for gene flow to be fluid throughout the region. Racers may be more likely to encounter bird nests, as they had more frequent movements and traversed greater distances on average than ratsnakes, which exhibited long periods of inactivity between directed movements. As for grassland birds, nest survival rates decreased with increasing shrubs and decreasing vegetation height. Discriminant function analysis revealed that successful nests were likely to occur in tall vegetation but reduced shrub cover, whereas higher shrub cover characterized snake habitats. Because snakes often use shrubs, nests in areas of increased shrubs may be at higher risk of predation by snakes. Targeted removal of shrubs may increase nest success by minimizing the activity of predators attracted to shrubs. Although predator removal is often a strategy for protecting bird populations, it may not be feasible in this instance, especially since snakes are a native component of the grassland community. Efforts to reduce snake predation on grassland bird nests should therefore focus on managing habitat within grasslands (i. e., shrubs) that influence snake activity, as no natural or anthropogenic habitat barriers currently limit snake movement across the landscape...|$|R
