5|$|The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MetLife) had an {{ownership}} stake <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>complex</b> {{ever since}} Centre Square was constructed and in 1992 became the sole owner. Wolgin sold his stake <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>complex</b> {{in the early}} 1980s, and a partnership led by Metropolitan Life of Virginia {{took control of the}} complex around 2000. In 2002 MetLife put the property up for sale, and in October of that year HRPT Properties Trust bought Centre Square for US$183.5 million plus closing costs. With the acquisition of Centre Square, HRPT Properties Trust (now called Equity Commonwealth) began an improvement and renovation plan for the complex. Improvements included modernization of its elevator, air conditioning, and safety systems. Architectural firm Daroff Design Inc.'s plans included cleaning the structures and a redesign of parts of the atrium and the plaza in front of the building.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} {{achievement}} for PLOT was the award-winning VM Houses in Ørestad, Copenhagen, in 2005. Inspired by Le Corbusier's Unité d'Habitation concept, they designed two residential blocks, {{in the shape}} of the letters V and M (as seen from the sky); the M House with 95 units, was completed in 2004, and the V House, with 114 units, in 2005. The design places strong emphasis on daylight, privacy and views. Rather than looking over the neighboring building, all of the apartments have diagonal views of the surrounding fields. Corridors are short and bright, rather like open bullet holes through the building. There are some 80 different types of apartment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>complex,</b> adaptable to individual needs. The building garnered Ingels and Smedt the Forum AID Award for the best building in Scandinavia in 2006. Ingels lived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>complex</b> until 2008 when he moved into the adjacent Mountain Dwellings.|$|E
30|$|Recently, we have {{reported}} on <b>the</b> creation of <b>complexes</b> on <b>the</b> base of scintillating gadolinium orthovanadate NPs doped with europium ions GdVO 4 :Eu 3 + (VNPs) and methylene blue (MB) photosensitizer and study of electronic excitation energy transfer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>complexes</b> [29].

5|$|The oldest {{building}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>complex</b> is the Executive, Library and Museum Building. Situated {{next to the}} Hills Capitol and the Huston Capitol, it {{was built}} in 1894. It was designated the Matthew J. Ryan Legislative Office Building on June 14, 1999, in recognition of former Speaker Matthew J. Ryan. The Ryan Office Building is the oldest building <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>complex</b> and was originally designed to house the State Library and State Museum of Pennsylvania, as well as the Governor's Office and Reception Room.

5|$|A mass {{of granite}} {{now in the}} Panamint Mountains intruded this complex 1400 mya. Pegmatic dikes and other widely spaced plutons of granite are also <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>complex</b> (a pluton is a large blob of magma deep {{underground}} and dikes are projections of that). Outcrops can be seen along {{the front of the}} Black Mountains in Death Valley and in the Talc and Ibex Hills. When the granite was being intruded, the west coast of North America ran through Eastern California and through an embayment that spread toward the Las Vegas Valley. This embayment, called the Amargosa aulacogen, had highlands north and south of it and {{was the result of a}} failed rift. Many thousands of feet of sediment filled the slowly subsiding basin.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} {{generalization of}} the derivative concerns complex functions of complex variables, such as functions from (a domain <b>in)</b> <b>the</b> <b>complex</b> numbers C to C. The {{notion of the}} derivative of such a function is obtained by replacing real variables with complex variables in the definition. If C is identified with R2 by writing a complex number z as , then a differentiable function from C to C is certainly differentiable as a function from R2 to R2 (in the sense that its partial derivatives all exist), but the converse is not true in general: the complex derivative only exists if the real derivative is complex linear and this imposes relations between the partial derivatives called the Cauchy–Riemann equations – see holomorphic functions.|$|E

5|$|Building J of the pre-Columbian site Monte Albán in Oaxaca {{state in}} Mexico was built around 275 BC, at a {{different}} orientation to other structures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>complex.</b> Its steps are aligned perpendicular to the rising of Capella at that time, so that a person looking out a doorway on the building would have faced it directly. Capella is significant as its heliacal rising took place within a day of the Sun passing directly overhead over Monte Albán.|$|E

5|$|Eisenhower {{would leave}} office with an {{agreement}} out of reach, as Eisenhower's technical advisors, upon whom he relied heavily, became mired <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>complex</b> technical questions {{of a test}} ban, driven {{in part by a}} strong interest among American experts to lower the error rate of seismic test detection technology. Some, including Kistiakowsky, would eventually raise concerns about the ability of inspections and monitors to successfully detect tests. The primary product of negotiations under Eisenhower was the testing moratorium without any enforcement mechanism. Ultimately, the goal of a comprehensive test ban would be abandoned in favor of a partial ban due to questions over seismic detection of underground tests.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} decades of his careers, Moser sought to clarify the taxonomic {{identity}} of European fungi by collecting specimens to be described as neotypes in the localities studied by Elias Magnus Fries, but this was no longer necessary after changes to nomenclatural rules that took effect in 1981. Among the Agaricales, Moser's interest was primarily <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>complex</b> genus Cortinarius. He published book-length works addressing Cortinarius taxa found in Europe and, co-writing with Horak, South America. Moser, working with Joe Ammirati, contributed to research on the genus in North America, and also examined Asian and Australasian taxa. He had a particular interest in Arctic–alpine habitats, and he documented, painted and published on his collections in these and other sites around the world. Moser initially doubted the usefulness of molecular phylogenetic analysis of the Agaricales, but later contributed to research in this area.|$|E

5|$|On April 20, 1925, Wright {{returned}} from eating {{dinner in the}} detached dining room when he noticed smoke billowing from his bedroom. By that time of night, most of the employees had returned home; only a driver and one apprentice were left <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>complex.</b> Unlike the first Taliesin fire, Wright {{was able to get}} help immediately. However, the fire quickly spread due to high winds. Despite the efforts of Wright and his neighbors to extinguish the flame, the living quarters of the second Taliesin were quickly destroyed. However, the workrooms where Wright kept his architectural drafts were spared. According to Wright's autobiography, the fire appeared to have begun near a telephone in his bedroom. Wright also mentioned a lightning storm approaching immediately before noticing the fire. Wright scholars speculate that the storm may have caused an electrical surge through the telephone system, sparking the fire.|$|E
