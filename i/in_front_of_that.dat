25|$|Having lost {{an entire}} month in {{reducing}} Roses, it was imperative that the Imperial corps {{get through to}} Duhesme, whose supply situation was becoming critical. There were two roads that Gouvion Saint-Cyr might use to reach Barcelona. The coastal road was blocked and was within range of Cochrane's squadron. The defiant defenders of Girona stood {{in the path of}} the inland road. Hoping to convince de Vives that he wanted to besiege Girona, the French general arrived <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> city with 15,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry. Sending back his artillery and baggage train, Gouvion Saint-Cyr led his troops into the mountains the next day. Cutting his way through a force of miquelets on the 12th, his column bypassed Girona and reached the inland highway at Sant Celoni on the 15th. This set the stage for the showdown Battle of Cardadeu on 16 December 1808.|$|E
25|$|Promised his marshal's baton if he {{captured}} Tarragona, Suchet arrived <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> coastal city on 3 May. The organization of Habert's division {{was the same}} as at Lerida. The Siege of Tarragona began on 5 May and lasted until 29 June 1811. The French captured Fort Olivo on 29 May and repulsed a counterattack the next day. Despite bitter resistance, they overcame the outlying forts one by one. On 21 June, Suchet's troops burst into the lower city and captured it. Three columns of French soldiers stormed into the upper city on 28 June. Gathering his men, Habert led a climactic charge against the defenders, breaking all resistance and capturing the Spanish commander Juan Senen de Contreras. The French infantry went berserk, massacring many helpless Spanish soldiers. English and Spanish accounts claim that up to 4,000 civilians were butchered. The French, while admitting that their troops ran amok, denied that their soldiers killed anyone other than armed enemies. As promised, Napoleon appointed Suchet a Marshal of France. During the siege, the French suffered 4,300 casualties, while inflicting 14,000 to 15,000 losses on the Spanish, including 8,000 men captured.|$|E

On Twitter, American gay rights activist Dan Savage argued that Alcorn's parents should be prosecuted for their role in bringing about their daughter's death, commenting that through their actions they [...] "threw her <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> truck". He cited the successful prosecution of Dharun Ravi following the suicide of Tyler Clementi as a legal precedent for such an action.

[...] A little known fact about MSU is that a bronze marker commemorating the students of MAC's class of 1861 who left to fight in the war is hidden on the wall behind tall bushes alongside the lobby of the present music building.

These veterans, under the leadership of Ransom McDonough Brooks, performed on campus in the 1870s and were the predecessors of today’s Spartan Marching Band. The Spartan Band was a military unit connected with the college ROTC for most of its existence. Until 1952, the band members wore military khaki uniforms.|$|E

[...] "I {{thought it would}} be interesting to play a gangster, maybe for the first time in the movies, who wasn't like those bad guys Edward G.

[...] "Also, because he had so much power and unquestioned authority, I {{thought it would be}} an interesting contrast to play him as a gentle man, unlike Al Capone, who beat up people with baseball bats." [...] Duvall later marveled to A's Biography, [...] "He minimized the sense of beginning. In other words he, like, deemphasized the word action. He would go <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> camera just like he was before. Cut! It was all the same. There was really no beginning. I learned a lot from watching that." [...] Brando won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance, but he declined it, becoming the second actor to refuse a Best Actor award (after George C. Scott for Patton). He boycotted the award ceremony, instead sending American Indian rights activist Sacheen Littlefeather, who appeared in full Apache attire, to state Brando's reasons, which were based on his objection to the depiction of American Indians by Hollywood and television.|$|E
2500|$|Supersonic flow behaves very {{differently}} from subsonic flow. Fluids react {{to differences in}} pressure; pressure changes are how a fluid is [...] "told" [...] to respond to its environment. Therefore, since sound is in fact an infinitesimal pressure difference propagating through a fluid, {{the speed of sound}} in that fluid can be considered the fastest speed that [...] "information" [...] can travel in the flow. This difference most obviously manifests itself {{in the case of a}} fluid striking an object. <b>In</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> object, the fluid builds up a stagnation pressure as impact with the object brings the moving fluid to rest. In fluid traveling at subsonic speed, this pressure disturbance can propagate upstream, changing the flow pattern ahead of the object and giving the impression that the fluid [...] "knows" [...] the object is there by seemingly adjusting its movement and is flowing around it. In a supersonic flow however, the pressure disturbance cannot propagate upstream. Thus, when the fluid finally reaches the object it strikes it and the fluid is forced to change its properties – temperature, density, pressure, and Mach number—in an extremely violent and irreversible fashion called a shock wave. The presence of shock waves, along with the compressibility effects of high-flow velocity (see Reynolds number) fluids, is the central difference between the supersonic and subsonic aerodynamics regimes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{rules of}} polo are written {{and used to}} provide for the safety of both players and horses. The rules are {{enforced}} in the game by the umpires who blow whistles when a penalty occurs. Strategic plays in polo are based on the [...] "line of the ball", an imaginary line created by the ball as it travels down the field. This line traces the ball's path and extends past the ball along that trajectory. The line of the ball defines rules for players to approach the ball safely. The [...] "line of the ball" [...] changes each time the ball changes direction. The player who hit the ball generally has the right of way, and other players cannot cross the line of the ball <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> player. As players approach the ball, they ride {{on either side of the}} line of the ball giving each access to the ball. A player can cross the line of the ball when it does not create a dangerous situation. Most fouls and penalty shots are related to players improperly crossing the line of the ball or the right of way. When a player has the line of the ball on his right, he has the right of way. A [...] "ride-off" [...] is when a player moves another player off the line of the ball by making shoulder-to-shoulder contact with the other players’ horses.|$|E
