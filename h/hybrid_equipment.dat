A cubic oriented proposal of ― 9 -point & 3 -plane ‖ for coregistration designs were verified to be geometrically practical. Human internal-feature points were sorted to combine with preselected external-feature points for matching process through 3 D-reconstruction and virtual-dissection. By following the procedures of feature-extraction and image-mapping, the processes of ―picking points to form plane ‖ and ―picking planes for segment ‖ were executed. Ultimately, image-fusions were implemented at the real-time workstation Mimics based on auto-fuse techniques so called ―information exchange ‖ and ―Signal Overlaying‖.

40|$|Electron {{temperatures}} in low-pressure {{inductively coupled plasma}} reactors do not significantly vary during the rf cycle. There can be, however, considerable modulation of the rate coefficients and the source functions of electron impact reactions having high threshold energies. This results from the electron energy distribution being less collisional at higher energies. In many instances, it is convenient to use cycle-averaged values for these quantities due to the computational burden in computing and storing space and time-dependent electron energy distributions. In this thesis a new “On-the-Fly ” Monte-Carlo technique is described to address these time-dependent plasma parameters. The On-the-Fly Monte-Carlo method, unlike conventional methods, stores only the moments of the electron energy distributions and not the distributions themselves.
