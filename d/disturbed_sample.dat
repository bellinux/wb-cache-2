30|$|The {{test was}} {{conducted}} with <b>disturbed</b> <b>sample</b> A from the source area. The sample was dried in an oven at 105 °Cat first, and then separated into grains by gently applying a wooden hammer. By means of free fall deposition method (Ishihara [1993]), the dry sample grains were set in the shear box, and saturated by carbon dioxide gas and de-aired water. The saturation degree was confirmed by the BD value suggested by Sassa ([1988]). When the BD value is higher than 0.95, the sample is recognized as fully saturated. In this test, BD was 0.97, showing a fully saturated condition. After normal consolidation at 295.7 kPa, the initial shear stress 137.9 kPa was loaded gradually while keeping the sample in a drained condition to avoid excess pore-water pressure generation. At this moment, the void ratio of the soil sample reached 0.650. Then, the sample was changed to an undrained condition, and the input signals of seismic loading (Figure  13) were loaded to simulate {{the condition of the}} original slope when the earthquake motion was applied as the initiation factor.|$|E

This research studied a <b>disturbed</b> <b>sample</b> of expansive soil collected in Nossa Senhora do Socorro – Sergipe, Brazil, through the following laboratory tests: sieve and hydrometer tests, Atterberg Limits, compaction, free swell and swell pressure. All direct and indirect methods mentioned in this paper indicated that the natural soil presented high to very high degree of expansion, which reached approximately 20 % of free swell and nearly 200 kPa of swell pressure. In order to evaluate the effect of lime, the same tests were conducted in soil-lime mixtures, using lime contents of 3 %, 6 % and 9 %. The results confirmed the efficiency of lime stabilization.

40|$|This {{research}} {{provides an}} insight into {{the quality of a}} soil sample during the penetration of a soil sampler. The investigation of the mechanical disturbances in a clay soil is conducted by using an updated Lagrangian finite element formulation with the 2 nd Piola-Kirchhoff stress rate (the Truesdell stress increment) to account for the large deformation behavior near the sampling tube. The penetration of the sampler is simulated by spliting a group of nodes ahead of the penetration route up to a sufficient depth and applying incremental deformation to match the geometric configuration of the sampling tube. Consolidation effect is included to account for the rate of penetration. Thin-layer elements are added into the inside wall of the sampling tube to model the soil-sampler interface. The modified Cam-clay model is used to simulate the behavior of the soils. An experimental study was conducted to study the variations of stresses and pore water pressures at the soil-sampler interface. The numerical results show that (1) soil samples are subjected to three distinct stages of vertical strain history, compression-extension-recompression. The first stage of compression, in particular, causes irrecoverable changes in the virgin soil properties of the soil; (2) the undrained shear strength of a <b>disturbed</b> <b>sample</b> reconsolidated to the in situ stress condition is larger than the virgin soil for normally consolidated soils but it is smaller for over consolidated soils; (3) the sampling disturbances due to friction at the soil-sampler interface increase as the sampler penetrates the soil.

The MDOM was administered to two groups, a mentally and emotionally <b>disturbed</b> <b>sample</b> of thirty-five Subjects from an inpatient facility and a normal sample of thirty-three community college Subjects. The MDOM was given in back-to-back interviews by two interviewers alternating in first interviewer, second interviewer roles. The data indicated acceptable inter-rater reliability for the Multi-Dimensional Outcome Measure. For anyone sample, all twelve scales showed acceptable reliability according to the criterion of a. 75 product moment correlation coefficient. However, four scales did not meet the. 75 level: Productivity I (. 55), Productivity II (. 74), Interpersonal Isolation [...] Family (. 71) when administered to the inpatient sample, and Drug Abuse (. 74) when administered to the community college sample. Assessment of the differences in reliability between samples showed higher reliability for the community college sample than for the inpatient sample with the exception of the Drug Abuse scale. Exploration of the differences in reliability between scales showed some scales contained items which were more relevant for the college student than for the inpatient. Other scales included items which were ambiguous or worded in an awkward manner which may have contributed to their lower reliability. Reliability could be increased as a result of the increased skill and clarification of questionable items. Scales which demonstrated unacceptable reliability the first weeks of the study indicated an acceptable level the last week. The data suggested that interviewers should be trained to insure acceptable reliability.

40|$|International audienceKnowledge about {{wildland}} fuel {{is essential}} to fire prevention and to both biodiversity conservation and reduction of the negative impacts of fire. Little is known of flammability of dead fuels, especially for non-reconstructed samples that are hypothesized to represent the field conditions. To {{assess the impact of}} the sampling method on the flammability, samples of litter were collected undisturbed (i. e. keeping intact the structure of litter layers, compactness and bulk-density) and <b>disturbed</b> (<b>sample</b> reconstructed using mainly the upper litter layer with a depth equal to the mean litter depth recorded on the plot) in limestone-derived soils in Provence. The sampling plan also comprised three types of vegetation among the most representative ecosystems of the study area: pure Pinus halepensis stands, mixed pine-oak stands and shrublands. At last, the sampling included four types of fire regime defined by the number of fires having occurred on each site since 1960 and the time interval since the last fire. Flammability experiments were carried out in laboratory using a glowing firebrand and a 10 kmh- 1 wind. The main variables recorded were: time-to-ignition, flaming duration, flame rate of spread, flame propagation, mean flame temperature, mean flame height and rate of consumption in order to assess the ignitability, sustainability, combustibility and consumability of each litter sample. Results showed that there was no significant effect of the fire regime (time interval since the last fire and number of fires) on the flammability parameters. The type of vegetation had a significant effect on all the parameters except on flaming duration, flame temperature and flame height. Litter sampled in mixed stands and in pure pine stands were more flammable than litter sampled in shrublands and mixed stand litter was more ignitable than pine litter. The type of sampling had a significant effect on all the parameters except on time-to-ignition and flaming duration; undisturbed litter being more flammable than disturbed litter, with higher combustibility and consumability. The intact litter structure seemed to be a very important factor in the flammability, especially in the combustibility and consumability of litter samples and these parameters might be underestimated using reconstructed litter samples. The type of vegetation was a significant factor especially on the ignitability of the litter samples, the sampled collected under mixed stands being more ventilated than the compacted pine needle litter...|$|E

Crop rotation and tillage practices influence soil properties, therefore understanding {{the effect of these}} practices is essential to maintaining optimal soil environment. The objective of this research was {{to determine the effects of}} various common cropping practices in western Kentucky on soil chemical and physical properties. In addition, soil samples from pasture and wooded areas collected to use as a reference for comparison among crop fields. There were five cropping systems identified, such as no till, till, non irrigated, irrigated fields and garden. Soils were sampled on October 1 st, 2017. Undisturbed and <b>disturbed</b> <b>samples</b> were collected from the depths of 0 - 6 cm and 6 - 12 cm. Undisturbed samples were collected using soil core (ring <b>sample),</b> while <b>disturbed</b> <b>samples</b> were taken using hand trawl. The samples were kept in the refrigerator until analysis. The undisturbed soil samples were used to analyze bulk density, porosity, soil water holding capacity and soil water content at field capacity. The <b>disturbed</b> <b>samples</b> were used to analyze soil organic matter (SOM) and soil pH. The data show that the highest SOM content was found in no till with the lowest in till systems. Wooded areas provided the highest soil water holding capacity and soil water content at field capacity. Total pore spaces were found relatively high in the garden and wooded areas. In all fields, soil pH was considered desirable at the range of 6 to 7. 5. In general, no till systems show stratification between depths in each measured soil property.

30|$|The {{presence}} {{of relationships between}} the compressibility parameters and the basic soil properties has been investigated from past to present. Many different correlations based on multiple linear regression analysis have been proposed for determination of compression index (Cc) soil by researchers (Skempton 1944; Terzaghi and Peck 1967; Azzouz et al. 1976; Nagaraj and Srinivasa Murthy 1985; Lav and Ansal 2001; Yoon et al. 2004; Solanki et al. 2008; Dipova and Cangir 2010; Bae and Heo 2011; Akayuli and Ofosu 2013; Lee et al. 2015). These studies are generally focused on relationships between the compression index and physical properties of the soils such as the initial void ratio (e 0), natural water content (wn), liquid limit (LL), and plasticity index (PI). Besides, the studies on the recompression index (Cr) seem to be quite limited (Nagaraj and Srinivasa Murthy 1985; Nakase et al. 1988; Isik 2009). The researches show that the physical parameters of soils {{have a significant effect}} on compressibility parameters of soil. In literature, the given regression equations to predict the compressibility parameters generally divided into two groups; connected with state variables such as void ratio and water content and connected with intrinsic variables such as liquid limit and plasticity index. It is known that the fully <b>disturbed</b> <b>samples</b> losing their memory involved with soil structure or stress history. Therefore, intrinsic properties are generally obtained by using fully <b>disturbed</b> <b>samples.</b> A number of previous researchers have reported that the compressibility of remolded clay has a specific relationship with the intrinsic variable of the clay (Lee et al. 2015). Due to the compression index of natural clay affected by the sedimentation case induced by deposition environments the evaluation using only intrinsic variables seems to be erroneous.|$|R
