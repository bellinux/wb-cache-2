5|$|Leslie takes {{possession}} of the jinniyah and asks for his brother {{to be returned to}} life. Anson is returned, but in a decaying state, complete with injuries from the crash. Leslie's second wish is for Anson to talk, which results in Anson screaming {{at the top of his}} lungs and telling his brother that he is cold. Back at the morgue, Scully finds the body has disappeared and Mulder suspects it is because of Leslie's wish. They go to the Stokes residence and Anson blows the house up trying to light the stove in an attempt to warm up. Mulder questions Jenn, the jinniyah, who says she's 500 years old. According to her, she gained her powers after wishing for great power and long life from another genie. She also says that Mulder unrolled her so he now has three wishes of his own. Mulder wishes for peace on earth and she wipes out the entire human population. With his second wish, Mulder undoes his first wish. Mulder then writes down his third wish to be very specific. However, just before making the final wish, Scully helps Mulder realize that the power of a genie should not be used to <b>force</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> be good, and so he ultimately wishes for Jenn to be free.|$|E

25|$|Burgher arms used to {{be common}} in France, but they {{disappeared}} in the French Revolution, which was hostile to heraldry. In {{the end of the}} 17th century, an attempt was made to list all arms in Armorial général as a device to increase tax revenue. When the attempt failed, in order to <b>force</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> pay tax, arms were given to many burghers who had never had them. These arms were never used by their recipients. In France burgher arms are not supposed to have a helmet.|$|E

25|$|During the Kosovo War {{thousands}} of Kosovo Albanian {{women and girls}} became victims of sexual violence. War rape {{was used as a}} weapon of war and an instrument of systematic ethnic cleansing; rape was used to terrorize the civilian population, extort money from families, and <b>force</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> flee their homes. According to a 2000 Human Rights Watch report war rape in the Kosovo War can generally be subdivided into three categories: rapes in women's homes, rapes during fighting, and rapes in detention. The majority of the perpetrators were Serbian paramilitaries, but they also included Serbian special police or Yugoslav army soldiers. Most rapes were gang rapes involving at least two perpetrators. Rapes occurred frequently in the presence, and with the acquiescence, of military officers. Soldiers, police, and paramilitaries often raped their victims in the full view of numerous witnesses.|$|E

500|$|The {{earthquake}} was {{preceded by}} a foreshock, which, although modest, {{was strong enough to}} cause chaos and <b>force</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> flee from their homes into the streets. The main shock originated southeast of Ambato. When the primary shock hit Ambato's main cathedral and military barracks collapsed, as did most of the city's buildings, scores of young girls preparing for their First Communion perished in the cathedral. The shaking ruptured water mains, disabled communication lines, opened cracks in the earth, reduced bridges to rubble, and derailed a train. The earthquake demolished buildings in rural hamlets; closer to the nearest mountains of the Andes, landslides destroyed roads and blocked rivers. The village of Libertad near Pelileo sank [...] into a huge hole about [...] in diameter with all of its 100inhabitants. Shaking up to intensity IV extended as far away as Quito and Guayaquil.|$|E

500|$|And {{yet despite}} his {{formidable}} record and undoubted {{importance in the}} history of technology, Evans never became a household name. In this respect Evans was his own worst enemy. He was deeply affected by a perceived lack of recognition and appreciation from his peers for his work, and his bouts of depression would lead him to act in the extreme, prematurely ending projects and vowing to give up inventing many times {{over the course of his}} life. In time these feelings turned to bitterness and vengeance towards those who criticized or doubted him, and led him to become notoriously bombastic and combative, often aggrandizing his accomplishments and fiercely denouncing critics (such as the wild exaggerations as to the success of the Oruktor Amphibolos at the end of his life). While his relentless pursuit of patent rights did indeed <b>force</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> pay him his due, the process badly damaged his reputation and made him many enemies. A leading Philadelphia merchant summed it up in 1802, stating [...] "few if any [...] are inclined to give pompous blockhead, Oliver Evans, the credit of inventing any of the useful contrivances in milling for which he now enjoys patents." ...|$|E
500|$|Bryant's {{star power}} and her extreme views were {{highlighted}} in national news stories. Mainstream news outlets such as The New York Times, Associated Press and Washington Post reported weekly updates on campaign progress, with smaller local newspapers {{across the country}} weighing in their editorial opinions on which side should prevail. Bryant appeared on Good Morning America and The Phil Donahue Show. Her tone and accusations united {{gay men and lesbians}} in cities all over the U.S. In the weeks before the vote, almost $55,000 was raised outside of Florida to oppose Save Our Children. Foreshadowing the effectiveness of the Save Our Children campaign, on April 13, 1977, the Florida Legislature voted not to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), to the astonishment of those anticipating the vote. The connection between the ERA and ordinance 77-4 was obvious to many. Florida Senator Dempsey Barron vocally opposed passing the ERA, fearing it would legalize same-sex marriages, <b>force</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> use unisex bathrooms, and that it would harm laws meant to protect families. National Organization for Women founder and ERA proponent Betty Friedan expressed her disdain, saying [...] "suddenly you have this red herring in Anita Bryant. Suddenly you have this wave of anti-gay hysteria and then that was preempting the air waves behind the scenes".|$|E

2500|$|Compulsory sterilization, {{also known}} as [...] forced or coerced sterilization, [...] {{programs}} are government policies which attempt to <b>force</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> undergo surgical or other sterilization. [...] The reasons governments implement sterilization programs vary in purpose and intent. In {{the first half of}} the 20th century, several such programs were instituted in countries around the world, usually as part of eugenics programs intended to prevent the reproduction of members of the population considered to be carriers of defective [...] genetic traits.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to Confucius’ li-based theory, the Legalism advocates {{the utilization of}} codified laws and harsh punishment to achieve social order. [...] This {{is due to the}} legalists’ belief that all human beings are born evil and self-interested. [...] Therefore, if left unrestrained, people would engage in selfish behavior which will undoubtedly lead to social unrest. [...] To cure this defect and <b>force</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> behave morally, the only way, believed the legalists, is to publicly promulgate clearly written laws and impose harsh punishments.|$|E

2500|$|Beckett {{also wanted}} to explore themes about making hard choices. To {{think outside the box}} {{sometimes}} requires not only [...] "transgressive" [...] but extremely [...] "cruel" [...] behavior, he told Kirkus Reviews. The ramifications of John Redlantern's transgression, he noted, also has a wide number of unintended ramifications. The novel explores a socially and theologically conservative society's reaction to this transgression, which at first leads to a reactionary response. Only later does it lead to social upheaval in ways some characters predict (most notably Tina Spiketree's fears of patriarchy) but in ways no one can anticipate. Beckett said much of {{the latter part of the}} novel is about how positive, creative new ways of thinking can still harm people badly, and <b>force</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> make sacrifices they do not wish to make.|$|E
2500|$|In 1929 the Soviet {{calendar}} {{was changed}} to replace the seven-day work week with a six-day one, with five days of work and the sixth day off; this was done in order to <b>force</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> work on Sunday {{instead of going to}} church. The Soviet leadership instituted measures to stop the celebration of Christmas and other religious feasts. For example, the 25th and 26 December were proclaimed [...] "Days of Industrialization" [...] in which the whole country was obligated to celebrate national industrialization by being at work for the whole day. High work absenteeism on religious feast days was reported throughout the 1930s, however. Workers that did go to church services on working Sundays or on such religious feast days could be punished for truancy. The new work week remained in effect until 1940.|$|E

This is not the only way you can see the world, globalization. We have another way to see it. And, at the same time, <b>force</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> look, to make a choice. What is your choice?

2500|$|In 1987, the Cult Awareness Network (CAN) held a {{press conference}} and {{demonstration}} in Washington, D.C., saying that the organization that teaches the Transcendental Meditation technique [...] "seeks to strip individuals of their ability to think and choose freely." [...] Steven Hassan, an author on the topic of cults, and at one time a CAN deprogrammer, said at the press conference that members display cult-like behaviors, {{such as the use of}} certain language and particular ways of dressing. TM teacher and spokesperson, Dean Draznin, [...] "discounted CAN's claims" [...] saying that Transcendental Meditation [...] "doesn't involve beliefs or lifestyle" [...] or [...] "mind control" [...] and [...] "We don't <b>force</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> take courses". Another spokesperson, Mark Haviland of the related College of Natural Law said that TM is [...] "not a philosophy, a life style or a religion.|$|E
2500|$|A {{feature of}} Peel's BBC Radio 1 shows were the famous John Peel Sessions, which usually {{consisted}} of four pieces of music pre-recorded at the BBC's studios. The sessions originally came about due to restrictions {{imposed on the}} BBC by the Musicians' Union and Phonographic Performance Limited which represented the record companies dominated by the EMI cartel. Because of these restrictions the BBC {{had been forced to}} hire bands and orchestras to render cover versions of recorded music. The theory behind this device was that it would create employment and <b>force</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> buy records and not listen to them free of charge on the air. One of the reasons why all of the offshore broadcasting stations of the 1960s were called [...] "pirates" [...] was because they operated outside of British laws and were not bound by the needle time restriction on the number of records they could play on the air.|$|E
2500|$|The Fifth Amendment [...] (Amendment V) to the United States Constitution {{is part of}} the Bill of Rights {{and protects}} {{individuals}} from being compelled to be witnesses against themselves in criminal cases. [...] "Pleading the Fifth" [...] is a colloquial term for invoking the right that allows witnesses to decline to answer questions where the answers might incriminate them, and generally without having to suffer a penalty for asserting the right. This evidentiary privilege ensures that defendants cannot be compelled to become witnesses at their own trials. If, however, they choose to testify, they are not entitled to the right during cross-examination, where questions are relevant to their testimony on direct examination. The Amendment requires that felonies be tried only upon indictment by a grand jury. Federal grand juries can <b>force</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> take the witness stand, but defendants in those proceedings have Fifth Amendment privileges until they choose to answer any question. To claim the privilege for failure to answer when being interviewed by police, the interviewee must have explicitly invoked the constitutional right when declining to answer questions.|$|E
