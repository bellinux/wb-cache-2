500|$|Jon Bonné of MSNBC used [...] "Homer's Enemy" [...] as {{an example}} of a bad episode of the eighth season and wrote [...] "even now , when {{subsequent}} episodes have debased Homer in new and innovative ways, the Grimes episode stands out as painful to watch." [...] In April 2007, former Simpsons executive producer Mike Reiss listed [...] "Homer's Enemy" [...] as one of his two least favorite episodes, stating, [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> episode was in bad taste." ...|$|E
500|$|Bannon set {{her stories}} in and among gay bars in the 1950s and 1960s that were secret. As {{described}} in Beebo Brinker, {{one had to}} knock on the door and be recognized before being let in. In reality, women were not allowed to wear pants in some bars in New York City. Police raided bars and arrested everyone within regularly; a raid on a gay bar prompted the seminal Stonewall riots in 1969 that started the gay rights movement. Because of the atmosphere of secrecy and shame, little was recorded at the time {{about what it was like}} to be gay then, and Bannon unwittingly recorded history from her own visits to Greenwich Village. In 2007, one of the writers who adapted three of the books into a play said of Bannon's work, [...] "I think she rises above the pulp. She wasn't trying to write trash. There wasn't any place for a woman to be writing this kind of material... But I <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> writing's transcended its time and its era and its market." ...|$|E
500|$|Manchester United manager Ferguson was {{critical}} {{of the performance of}} referee D'Urso: [...] "I felt sorry for the referee today, it doesn't matter how much training you have in any job. It's about temperament, and I <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> lad was too nervous for that today." [...] Despite losing their fourth consecutive Charity Shield match, Ferguson did not believe it would affect his team heading into the start of the season: [...] "We certainly hope we can go on to win the title again like we have in previous years. We just need to keep the standards up and show the desire we did in the second half." [...] He was also unsure whether Liverpool would be able to challenge for the Premier League: [...] "It's difficult to assess Liverpool at the moment. They started with confidence, but then you would expect that from a team that won three trophies a few months ago. You would also expect us to be sluggish at the start, because we are bloody good at it." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Best Mistake" [...] {{was written}} by Denisia [...] "Blu June" [...] Andrews, Brittany Coney, Ariana Grande, Big Sean, Corey Jackson Carter, and with production, {{programming}} and instruments done by Key Wane. The vocals were produced by Curtis [...] "Sauce" [...] Wilson, with Gregg Rominiecki engineering Big Sean's vocals. Serban Ghenea handled the mixing of the track, which was engineered by John Hanes, and finally the mix was mastered by Aya Merrill and Tom Coyne. It is a minimal hip-hop piano ballad lament that utilizes instrumentation from strings and a drum machine. It is about a couple trying to [...] "make up their minds {{about the future of}} their relationship, with deep affection buried underneath their problems." [...] Grande revealed that [...] "Best Mistake" [...] was her favorite track on My Everything: [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> world of [...] and I'm obsessed with his writing on this song in particular. I'm a huge fan of his in general but I feel like his writing on this song is so, so fantastic, it like strikes a chord in my heart. I love it so much." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{subjects}} {{focused on}} in the album's lyrics include Vanilla Ice's abusive childhood and drug addiction. He stated that [...] "I wrote 'Fuck Me' 'cause I know how I've been perceived. [...] "I can {{look back at the}} whole Vanilla Ice thing, and it was played way out. It was just an image thing. I was always real to the music. But it built a huge hurdle for me to get over musically. A lot of people didn't even want to admit they bought a Vanilla Ice record." [...] "Too Cold" [...] is a rap rock remake of Vanilla Ice's biggest hit, [...] "Ice Ice Baby". Vanilla Ice stated that he remade the song because [...] "I wanted to let people know that I'm not running from anything. This is me. This is what I'm about. I think the music speaks for itself. If the music was whack, nobody'd even care to hear anything about no Vanilla Ice. I <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> music is so strong people are kinda comin' out of the closet. It's like, 'You know, hey, I bought it back in the day, and the new stuff is slammin'.' I think there's some hip-hop influenced, stage-diving, body piercing, tattooed white boys out there who are embracing this new sound." [...] "Too Cold" [...] was originally intended to be released as a hidden track or B-side.|$|E

However, on May 22, 2014, he was controversially omitted from the final U.S. squad by manager Jürgen Klinsmann. Klinsmann called it [...] "one of the toughest decisions in [...] coaching career", but said, [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> other guys right now {{are a little bit}} ahead of him." [...] Klinsmann's decision, which was described by media staff as abruptly timed after Klinsmann had previously promised to wait until after the team's friendly matches to announce cuts, saw additional controversy when Klinsmann's son Jonathan published and later deleted a post on Twitter that appeared to ridicule Donovan following the announcement.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Tao Ruspoli, Cockburn said, [...] "No doubt about it, since I got here in the early 70s things have gone downhill. The Left is in terrible shape. What's the leading obsession of the Left right now? This whole, I think, mad idea that Bush and Cheney organised {{the attack on the}} World Trade Towers. I think it's absolutely insane. I think [...] are capable of monstrous evil, I <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> theories they have - of no plane hitting the Pentagon - is nutty. It's like flying saucers." [...] He noted that his friend Chuck Spinney had a friend on the plane who was later identified by his dental records because his teeth were found inside the Pentagon. Cockburn writes in standard incisive wit [...] "This doesn’t faze the conspiracists. They’re immune to any reality check. Spinney “worked for the government.” They switched the dental records. The Boeing 757 was flown to Nebraska for a rendez-vous with President Bush, who shot the passengers, burned the bodies on the tarmac and gave Spinney’s friend’s teeth to Dick Cheney to drop through a hole in his trousers amid the debris in the Pentagon." ...|$|E

6000|$|Bittridge {{decided the}} {{question}} of hand-shaking for her when they met. He greeted her glooming brother with a jolly [...] "Hello, Boyne!" [...] and without waiting for the boy's tardy response he said [...] "Hello, Lottie!" [...] to the girl, {{and took her hand}} and kept it in his while he made an elaborate compliment to her good looks and her gain in weight. She had come tardily as a proof that she would not have come in at all if she had not chosen to do so, and Mrs. Bittridge was already seated beside Ellen on the sofa, holding her hand, and trying to keep her mobile, inattentive eyes upon Ellen's face. She was a little woman, youthfully dressed, but not dressed youthfully enough for the dry, yellow hair which curled tightly in small rings on her skull, like the wig of a rag-doll. Her restless eyes were round and deep-set, with the lids flung up out of sight; she had a lax, formless mouth, and an anxious smile, with which she constantly watched her son for his initiative, while she recollected herself from time to time, long enough to smooth Ellen's hand between her own, and say, [...] "Oh, I <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> world of Clarence; and I guess he thinks his mother is about right, too," [...] and then did not heed what Ellen answered.|$|E

Both of these tracks make great album cuts but I <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> UK will find it hard to deal with such lyrics in a pop single no matter how urban / street the artist is. Ms Dynamite is back and she is more than living up to her name via the lyrical content. The overall double A-side single was rated 3/5.|$|E
