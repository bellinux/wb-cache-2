5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>overwhelming</b> {{evidence}} of global disruption of plant communities at the K–Pg boundary. Extinctions are seen both {{in studies of}} fossil pollen, and fossil leaves. In North America, the data suggests massive devastation and mass extinction of plants at the K–Pg boundary sections, although there were substantial megafloral changes before the boundary. In North America, approximately 57% of plant species became extinct. In high southern hemisphere latitudes, such as New Zealand and Antarctica, the mass die-off of flora caused no significant turnover in species, but dramatic and short-term changes in the relative abundance of plant groups. In some regions, the Paleocene recovery of plants began with recolonizations by fern species, represented as a fern spike in the geologic record; this same pattern of fern recolonization was observed after the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption.|$|E

25|$|Several {{environmental}} risk {{factors have been}} proposed to {{support the hypothesis that}} the actual frequency of autism has increased. These include certain foods, infectious disease, pesticides. There <b>is</b> <b>overwhelming</b> scientific evidence against the MMR hypothesis and no convincing evidence for the thiomersal (or Thimerosal) hypothesis, so these types of risk factors have to be ruled out. Although it is unknown whether autism's frequency has increased, any such increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics.|$|E

25|$|An {{abundance}} of clinical and epidemiological evidence supports that light skin pigmentation developed {{due to the}} importance of maintaining vitamin D3 production in the skin. Dark skin pigmentation was the original condition for the genus Homo and has been maintained for populations in areas of high UV radiation through human evolutionary history. As a consequence, {{there must have been a}} strong selective pressure for the evolution of light skin in areas of low UV radiation. The evidence that dark skin evolved as a protection against the effect of UV radiation <b>is</b> <b>overwhelming,</b> and research shows that eumelanin protects against both folate depletion and direct damage to DNA. This accounts for the development of dark skin pigmentation of people living near the equator but does not account for the increasingly lighter-skinned people living outside the tropics.|$|E

[...] Blassingame outlines efforts of slaves to run away and rebel, particularly the Stono Rebellion of 1739, Charles Deslondes's revolt in 1811, Nat Turner's revolt of 1831, and the participation of fugitive slaves in Florida fighting with Seminoles during the Seminole Wars. Blassingame concludes that the Sambo and Nat stereotypes [...] "were real." [...] He explains, [...] "The more fear whites had of Nat, the more firmly tried to believe in Sambo in order to escape paranoia." ...|$|E

500|$|Critics also {{state that}} {{evolution}} {{is not a}} fact. In science a fact is a verified empirical observation while in colloquial contexts a fact can simply refer to anything for which there <b>is</b> <b>overwhelming</b> evidence. For example, in common usage theories such as [...] "the Earth revolves around the Sun" [...] and [...] "objects fall due to gravity" [...] may {{be referred to as}} [...] "facts," [...] even though they are purely theoretical. From a scientific standpoint, therefore, evolution may be called a [...] "fact" [...] {{for the same reason that}} gravity can: under the scientific definition, evolution is an observable process that occurs whenever a population of organisms genetically changes over time. Under the colloquial definition, the theory of evolution can also be called a fact, referring to this theory's well-established nature. Thus, evolution is widely considered both a theory and a fact by scientists.|$|E

Rosecrans made an unopposed {{landing on the}} western shore of Tulagi about halfway between the two ends of the oblong-shaped island. Beds of coral near the shore kept the landing craft from reaching the shoreline. The Marines, however, were able to wade the remaining [...] without hindrance from the Japanese forces, who were apparently taken by surprise by the landings and had yet to begin any organized resistance. At this time, the Japanese forces on Tulagi and Gavutu, a detachment of the 3rd Kure Special Naval Landing Force (SNLF) plus members of the Yokohama Air Group—commanded by Captain Shigetoshi Miyazaki—signaled their commander at Rabaul—Captain Sadayoshi Yamada—that they were under attack, were destroying their equipment and papers, and signed off with the message, [...] "Enemy troop strength <b>is</b> <b>overwhelming,</b> We will defend to the last man."
