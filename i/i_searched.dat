500|$|Hopley {{was sentenced}} to four years of penal {{servitude}} at Millbank Prison. After being indicted, he wrote: [...] "while anguish shook the frame, the conscience suffered not one pang. <b>I</b> <b>searched</b> and searched among the deepest secrets of my soul, and could not blame myself... I could look up tranquilly {{into the face of}} heaven who knew me to be Not Guilty." [...] He believed that his actions were justifiable because he had undertaken them in his duty as schoolteacher. He portrayed himself as a victim of public opinion, claiming that [...] "a mournful accident was swelled up into a bloody midnight murder, and how it has been brought about that my unfortunate name has been branded, not simply through the United Kingdom, but through the civilised world, {{as one of the most}} execrable monsters or of madmen." [...] He published a pamphlet arguing that Locock had perjured himself and had conspired with Fowler to influence the outcome of the trial.|$|E
500|$|Dodner {{said that}} during {{development}} of the game, she travelled to New Zealand once a month with builds of the game for the filmmakers to play, and on which to give their feedback, and that in total, EA had acquired {{a quarter of a}} million different assets from the production. Schofield further pointed out [...] "we even hired the same stunt doubles from the movie to help us render the most realistic movements in the game." [...] Dobner also said [...] "we want the game to not just look like the films but to be exactly like the films." [...] She commented that no details in the game were made up; [...] "when we were reproducing Minas Tirith [...] we felt the team would benefit from being able to see and feel a piece of the actual movie set. Unfortunately, the set had already been dismantled. So, while in New Zealand, <b>I</b> <b>searched</b> the various warehouses to find remnants of the dismantled set. After much work, I returned to San Francisco proudly bearing four bricks from the Minas Tirith set." ...|$|E
500|$|The live {{performance}} for [...] "I Was Here" [...] {{as part of}} 4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé, where it served as the closing song, was taped and premiered online on November 16, 2011. It was added on the DVD Live at Roseland: Elements of 4, which was released in late November 2011. The video begins with Beyoncé onstage in a shimmery silver minidress, giving the crowd {{a bit of a}} windup about where [...] "I Was Here" [...] came from. She says: [...] "It's taken {{a lot of hard work}} to get to where I am. <b>I</b> <b>searched</b> all around the world, and I found myself. You all are my inspiration. I want to sing this last song and dedicate it to all of you guys." [...] The video then turns into a career retrospective in the form of Beyoncé's home movies and her professional highlights. It splices poignant memories throughout Beyoncé's life, from her childhood, to partying and vacations with her family, to most of the locations she visited around the world, to her rise with Destiny's Child into solo stardom and her love story with Jay-Z. Also containing footage from major performances and awards shows, the clip begins with a young Beyoncé thanking the judges in a talent show and later doing the snake in her living room, performing in her TLC-inspired neon overalls.|$|E

2500|$|Finger offered such {{suggestions}} {{as giving}} the character a cowl {{instead of the}} domino mask, a cape instead of wings, adding gloves, and removing the red sections from the original costume. He later said his suggestions were influenced by Lee Falk's popular The Phantom, a syndicated newspaper comic strip character with which Kane was also familiar, and that he devised the name Bruce Wayne for the character's secret identity. As Finger described, [...] "Bruce Wayne's first name came from Robert Bruce, the Scottish patriot. Wayne, being a playboy, {{was a man of}} gentry. <b>I</b> <b>searched</b> for a name that would suggest colonialism. I tried Adams, Hancock ... then I thought of Mad Anthony Wayne." [...] Kane decades later in his autobiography described Finger as [...] "a contributing force on Batman right from the beginning... I made Batman a superhero-vigilante when I first created him. Bill turned him into a scientific detective." [...] Finger biographer Marc Tyler Nobleman described, [...] "Bob [...] showed Bat-Man to [...] Vin [...] — without Bill.
