40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to analyse the links between the <b>health</b> and the <b>education</b> sectors in legal {{documents}} and in field practices, i. e., to compare the theory with the practice of implementing <b>health</b> promotion and <b>education</b> programmes in schools. In a first phase, a document analysis study on the organization of <b>health</b> services and <b>education</b> services regarding, respectively, the "School Health" and "Health Education" national programmes and guidelines was carried out {{in order to understand the}} contributions of both sectors to the <b>health</b> promotion and <b>education</b> in schools. A second phase will be carried out in the field by assessing the implementation processes of <b>health</b> promotion and <b>education</b> programmes in schools. The preliminary analysis of key documents has showed that the partnership between <b>Health</b> and <b>Education</b> sectors exists formally since 1994, when Portugal joined the European Network of Health Promoting Schools (ENHPS). Later, in 2006, both Ministries of <b>Health</b> and <b>Education</b> signed a common protocol for the development of <b>health</b> promotion and <b>education</b> activities. The commitments assumed by both sectors aim at promoting active participation and interdisciplinary team of <b>health</b> and <b>education</b> professionals in order to build a common and structured <b>health</b> promotion and <b>education</b> programme with the contribution of different areas of knowledge (<b>health</b> and <b>education).</b> Both Ministries have developed measures and undergone structural changes that allow a deeper and more systematic cooperation between <b>health</b> and <b>education</b> sectors. Taking into account the documents produced by the Ministries of <b>Health</b> and <b>Education,</b> it can be concluded that the foundations for a successful interaction between these two sectors have been set up. Future work in the field, by assessing the implementation processes of <b>health</b> promotion and <b>education</b> programmes in schools, will show how the practices incorporate the theory.

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{problems}} of <b>health</b> physical <b>education,</b> its boundaries and classification in the context of adapted physical activity. It supplies us with an overview of the possibilities of further studies in this field and informs us of the state of <b>health</b> physical <b>education</b> at elementary, secondary and university school levels. <b>Health</b> physical <b>education</b> has sprung from the framework of the national education program and is classified {{as a part of the}} academic subject of physical education. It is focused on stabilizing and improving the physical state of individuals with an impairment in health, determined in medical statements for children and youth. Qualified pedagogical staff is imperative for <b>health</b> physical <b>education,</b> however as of yet insufficiently recruited. Likewise, a sufficient number of <b>health</b> physical <b>education</b> departments is not yet ensured. The reduction of educational units accounts for all types of schools, even though the number of individuals with a health impairment is steadily increasing, especially those with a weakening in muscular-skeletal system. Further education of pedagogical staff, and thereby also qualified training of <b>health</b> physical <b>education,</b> is imperative to stabilize and correct the health state of our adepts. On an international scale it is possible to assess <b>health</b> physical <b>education</b> as a part of adapted physical activity. In the Czech Republic both <b>health</b> physical <b>education</b> and adapted physical education have been taught side by side, and no serious attempt of connecting the two disciplins has been made. It seems time is ripe to formulate such a connection and cooperation on an academical level.
