5|$|Although it {{has since}} been {{replaced}} {{with a number of}} smaller displays available to the public in the reception area showing some traditional Scouting skills, a notable collection of Baden-Powell memorabilia has been on display in the past for visitors in 'The story of B-P' exhibition. This included many drawings and letters by Baden-Powell himself, such as the original of his , Laws for me when I am old and several first editions of his books. The former exhibition also <b>displayed</b> <b>the</b> original painting by David Jagger, as presented to Baden-Powell on 29 August 1929 at the 'Coming of Age' 3rd World Scout Jamboree. This painting, a personal favourite of Baden-Powell, is often used in publications throughout the Scout movement. The Baden-Powell memorabilia has since been moved to the headquarters for Scouting in the UK, Gilwell Park.|$|E
5|$|Although the College {{building}} was saved from the war, its walls and roof {{were left in}} a perilous state. In 1954 a decision was forced upon heralds, whether to abandon the old building (which would have been profitable financially) or repair it on a scale far beyond the College's resources. Eventually {{with the help of}} the Ministry of Works and a public subscription, the {{building was}} repaired in time for the College's 4th centenary of being in possession of Derby Place. The present gates to the building were added in 1956, and came originally from Goodrich Court in Herefordshire. The new gates <b>displayed</b> <b>the</b> College's arms and crest.|$|E

5|$|At this point, Grant began {{describing}} {{himself as}} the O.H.O. (Outer Head of the Order) of the O.T.O., claiming that he deserved this title not by direct succession from Crowley but because he <b>displayed</b> <b>the</b> inspiration and innovation that Germer lacked. A document purportedly by Crowley naming Grant as his successor was subsequently exposed as a hoax created by Robert Taylor, a Typhonian O.T.O. member. In the early 1970s he established his own Thelemic organisation, the Typhonian O.T.O., which produced its first official announcement in 1973. Although adopting the O.T.O. degree system used by Crowley, Grant removed the rituals of initiation designed to allow a member to enter a higher degree; instead he personally promoted them through the degrees according to what he believed were their own personal spiritual development.|$|E
5|$|Before World WarII, all {{homes were}} {{required}} to display Hinomaru on national holidays. Since the war, the display of the flag of Japan is mostly limited to buildings attached to national and local governments such as city halls; it is rarely seen at private homes or commercial buildings, but some people and companies have advocated displaying the flag on holidays. Although the government of Japan encourages citizens and residents to fly the Hinomaru during national holidays, they are not legally required to do so. Since the Emperor's 80th Birthday on December 23, 2002, the Kyushu Railway Company has <b>displayed</b> <b>the</b> Hinomaru at 330 stations.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the delayed}} 1926 order for 20 K class {{locomotives}} began in 1928 after alteration to the U class specification. As {{a result of}} Harold Holcroft’s position as one of Maunsell’s assistants, the new-builds also <b>displayed</b> <b>the</b> Churchward GWR 4300 Class influence. The ideas applied to this class were already used on the N, N1 and K class rebuilds, including long-travel valves for fast running, Belpaire firebox and conical boilers, constructed at the North British Locomotive Works in Glasgow. The first of the production batch emerged from Brighton works in August 1928 and featured a tapered chimney and smokebox snifting valves, {{both of which were}} used on the K and N class locomotives.|$|E

5|$|Cunningham {{was allowed}} back onto operations. He was given command of No. 85 Squadron RAF, {{equipped}} with the de Havilland Mosquito NF.II based at Hunsdon. He selected Jimmy Rawnsley as his operator. The radar set <b>displayed</b> <b>the</b> entire picture. A small cathode-ray tube set {{on the left side}} of the instrument panel gave Cunningham a composite image. The duo decided Rawnsley should control the interception in the initial stages until they reached a point where the enemy could take evasive action. Then Cunningham would take over while Rawnsley would call out the ranges and free the pilot from looking at his ray-tube.|$|E
5|$|E. When Jos Verstappen stalled his {{car on the}} grid, Race Director Charlie Whiting {{attempted}} to abort the start, a procedure that is carried out when a car is stalled before the lights go out. However, {{the lights went out}} before he had the chance to do so, and as a result the lights afterwards <b>displayed</b> <b>the</b> standard 5 red lights and 3 amber lights. The race was immediately stopped, but the red flag was not displayed until the cars came to the start/finish line. As is the case when a start is aborted, the race was shortened by one lap as the cars were not refuelled, but Verstappen was allowed to regain his original grid position in 15th.|$|E
5|$|Ermac is {{a fictional}} {{character}} in the Mortal Kombat fighting game franchise by Midway Games. The character originated due to rumors over a diagnostics menu listing that <b>displayed</b> <b>the</b> text ERMACS, followed by claims of an alleged glitch in the first game. Rumors of the alleged character were perpetuated by video game magazine Electronic Gaming Monthly (EGM), and due to the growing interest, he was added by the series developers to the roster of playable characters in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, as a red palette swap of Scorpion. Ermac has become a recurring {{character in the}} Mortal Kombat games after playing {{a central role in}} , in which he had a distinctive redesign and joined forces with series protagonist Liu Kang, but he has had smaller roles in subsequent series releases.|$|E

5|$|Ferranti {{began work}} on {{building}} the computer on 1 December 1950, with engineer Raymond Stuart-Williams adapting the design by Bennett into a working machine. Development was completed by 12 April 1951, resulting in a device twelve feet wide, nine feet deep, and five feet tall. The majority of the volume was taken up by vacuum tubes and the light bulbs that <b>displayed</b> <b>the</b> state of the game, with the actual computer taking up {{no more than two}} percent of the total volume of the machine. The Nimrod took the form of a large box with panels of lights, with a raised stand in front of it with buttons corresponding with the lights, which in turn represented the objects the player could remove.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, predating Booth's attempt, WMATA {{released}} a professionally designed graphic that <b>displayed</b> <b>the</b> Silver Line on an unofficial map that resembled the current version, but with thin lines.

A poster displaying a map of similar design has been hanging in DC Councilman Jack Evans' office for a number of years, but received scant attention until 2008. Wyman, one of the original designers of the map, was confirmed as the layout specialist who would be redesigning the map by the Washington Post on June 4, 2011.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo's {{youth was}} spent in a Florence that was ornamented by the works of these artists and by Donatello's contemporaries, Masaccio, whose figurative frescoes were imbued with realism and emotion, and Ghiberti, whose Gates of Paradise, gleaming with gold leaf, <b>displayed</b> <b>the</b> art of {{combining}} complex figure compositions with detailed architectural backgrounds. Piero della Francesca had made a detailed study of perspective, {{and was the first}} painter to make a scientific study of light.

The current composition, with the symbols of the Evangelists duplicated {{on each side of}} the hilt, matches that known from the earliest preserved depiction drafted by Johann Christoph Werner in 1794. It is possible, though, that the original placement of the golden plates was different, with the symbols of Saints John and Matthew on the obverse of the grip, so that each side of the hilt <b>displayed</b> <b>the</b> symbols of all four of the Evangelists.|$|E
5|$|Several ancient English towns <b>displayed</b> <b>the</b> Royal Arms of England {{upon their}} seals and, when it {{occurred}} to them to adopt insignia of their own, used the Royal Arms, albeit with modification, as their inspiration.

Hereford changes the lions from gold to silver, and in the 17th century was granted a blue border charged with silver saltires in allusion to its siege by a Scottish army during the English Civil War. The town council of Faversham changes only the hindquarters of the three lions to silver. Berkshire County Council bore arms with two golden lions in reference to its royal patronage and the Norman kings' influence upon the early history of Berkshire.|$|E
