2500|$|The hi-hat cymbals (nicknamed [...] "hats") {{consist of}} two cymbals mounted {{facing each other}} on a metal pole with folding support legs that keep a hollow support {{cylinder}} standing up. Like the bass drum, the hi-hat has a foot pedal. The bottom cymbal is fixed in place. The top cymbal is mounted on a thin pole which is inserted into the hollow cymbal stand cylinder. The thin pole is connected to a foot pedal. When the foot pedal is pressed down, a mechanism causes the thin pole to move down, causing the cymbals to move together. When the foot is lifted off the pedal, the cymbals move apart, due to the pedal's spring-loaded mechanism. The hi-hats can be sounded by striking the cymbals {{with one or two}} sticks or just by opening and closing the cymbals with the <b>footpedal,</b> without striking the cymbals. The ability to create rhythms on the hi-hats with the foot alone enables drummers to use both sticks on other drums or cymbals. Different sounds can be created by striking [...] "open hi-hats" [...] (without the pedal depressed, which creates a noisy sound nicknamed [...] "sloppy hats") or a crisp [...] "closed hi-hats" [...] sound (with the pedal pressed down). As well, the high hats can be played with a partially depressed pedal.|$|E
50|$|The {{sounds were}} at first {{produced}} by neon-tube relaxation oscillators (later, thyratrons, then transistors), which produced sawtooth-like waveforms. The pitch {{was determined by}} the amount of resistive wire chosen by the performer (allowing vibrato, quarter-tones, and portamento). The oscillator output was fed into two parallel resonant filter circuits. A <b>footpedal</b> controlled the volume ratio of the output of the two filters, which was sent to an amplifier.|$|E

The digital [...] "pages" [...] can be turned by pressing an electronic <b>footpedal,</b> thus enabling performers to play chamber music or solo pieces with difficult page turns without hiring or finding a volunteer to act as a page turner. The music notation is typically displayed on a flatscreen display or a tablet computer screen.|$|E

5000|$|One of the {{earliest}} modern exponents of multiple instruments was Jesse Fuller. Fuller developed a foot-operated bass instrument which he called the [...] "footdella", which had six bass strings which were struck by hammers. In [...] "one-man-band" [...] shows, Fuller would use his [...] "footdella", a footpedal-operated [...] "sock" [...] (bass drum), a homemade neck harness (for a harmonica, kazoo and microphone), and a 12-string guitar. Fate Norris, of the Skillet Lickers, a hillbilly string band of the 1920s and early 1930s developed a geared mechanical contraption with <b>footpedals</b> that enabled him to play guitar, bells, bass fiddle, fiddle, autoharp and mouth harp.|$|R
50|$|The ASR-10 had a {{powerful}} 31 voice synthesis architecture that resembled a synthesizer rather than a sampler. After selecting a sample, the sound could further be modified by up to 3 envelopes (hardwired to pitch, filter, and amplitude), 2 filters in series, one LFO, and 15 modulation sources. Up to 8 layers of different samples could be stacked together to form an 'instrument', and up to 127 different samples available up at any one time. Each sample could be modulated by any number of modulation sources, including velocity, polyphonic aftertouch, LFOs, envelopes, <b>footpedals,</b> or {{combinations of the two}} patch-select buttons on the left hand side of the keyboard. These patch-select buttons(an Ensoniq trademark) allowed the player to instantly recall during performance any one of four pre-programmed combinations of the eight layers to be sounded.|$|R
50|$|Two {{models were}} released: the Alpha Juno 1 (JU-1) (1985), and the Alpha Juno 2 (JU-2) (1985), which added one octave of notes, a {{cartridge}} slot and touch-sensitivity. Alpha Juno synthesizers were notable for their reduced user interface {{compared to other}} synths of the day, with a single Alpha Dial replacing many sliders and knobs. The keyboard features MIDI in, out and thru, mono, stereo and headphone sockets. It also supports an external <b>footpedal</b> controller, and tape backup.|$|E
50|$|In 1983, MXR {{introduced}} one of {{the first}} multi-effect rack units for guitar and bass, the Omni. The Omni had 6 different effects: sustain, distortion, delay, equalization, flanger and chorus. The main unit was a 2U with separate controls for each effect. There was a <b>footpedal</b> (M-181) that enabled the player to switch the different effects on and off, as well as changing the order of the distortion and equalizer effects, a master bypass as well as an effects loop.|$|E
5000|$|The {{back panel}} {{is unusual in}} that it is tilted from {{vertical}} so that the connectors {{can be seen from the}} front of the instrument. There are quarter-inch jacks for recording data to cassette tape, sustain and program change <b>footpedal</b> jacks, MIDI in, out and [...] "thru" [...] DIN connectors, a monaural quarter-inch audio output, a quarter-inch headphone jack, and memory protect and power switches. Some models have a voltage selection for the power supply on the underneath of the synth.|$|E
40|$|The spatial {{modulation}} {{effect has}} been reported in somatosensory spatial judgments when the task-irrelevant auditory stimuli are given from the opposite direction. Two experiments examined how the spatial modulation effect on somatosensory spatial judgments is altered in various body regions and their spatial locations. In experiment 1, air-puffs were presented randomly to either the left or right cheeks, hands (palm versus back) and knees while auditory stimuli were presented from just behind ear on either the same or opposite side. In experiment 2, air-puffs were presented to hands which were aside of cheeks or placed on the knees. The participants were instructed to make speeded discrimination responses regarding the side (left versus right) of the somatosensory targets by using two <b>footpedals.</b> In all conditions, reaction times significantry increased when the irrelevant stimuli were presented from the opposite side rather than from the same side. We found that the back of the hands were more influenced by incongruent auditory stimuli than cheeks, knees and palms, and that the hands were more influenced by incongruent auditory stimuli when placed at the side of cheeks than on the knees. These results indicate that the auditory-somatosensory interaction differs in various body regions and their spatial locations...|$|R
5000|$|The Reeves AN/MSQ-51 Aerial Target Control Central (ATCC) was a {{combination}} radar/computer/communications system ("Q" [...] system") developed 1961-3 for United States Navy [...] "aerial target out-of-sight control". In addition to the [...] "Target Control System AN/SRW-4D" [...] with radios and [...] "Antenna Assemblies for Target Control and Communications (7 Units)", the ATCC included acquisition/surveillance and tracking radars, a Mark X IFF/SIF, and an analog computer. The ATCC's automatic tracking radar {{was derived from the}} Western Electric M-33 gun laying radar and could process double-pulse 9340-9370 MHz beacon returns from transponders up to 400,000 yd away from the AN/MSQ-51 transmitting 9215-9285 MHz radar pulses. If an ATCC was equipped with a [...] "Telemetry Receiving Station", IRIG channels 5-14 could also be received from QF-9G and Q-2C unmanned aerial vehicles. Other ATCC-controlled drones included the QF-9F, KDA-1, KDA-4, KDB-1 and KD2R-5. For [...] "RF communications (2 to 25 mc.)" [...] to command the drone was a [...] "Collins Radio Co.

5000|$|Joe Barrick, who {{was born}} in Oklahoma in 1922, wanted a way of {{accompanying}} himself on fiddle, so he built a contraption with a guitar neck on a board with <b>footpedals</b> to operate the notes. Subsequent versions of this [...] "piatar" [...] also had bass guitar and banjo necks and a snare drum which are played by foot-operated hammers. To change notes on the guitar-family instruments, a foot treadle operates a mechanical fretting device. Two notable one-man blues bands active in Memphis in the 1950s were Doctor Ross and Joe Hill Louis, playing guitar, harmonica and bass drum/high-hat.The simple guitar and harmonica combination (as used by such musicians as Tex Williams, Anton Newcombe, Jimmy Reed, Bob Dylan, Neil Young, and Ray Dorset of Mungo Jerry) is so common now that it is rarely considered to be a one-man band. British-born Don Partridge made the classic one-man band outfit (bass drum on the back, guitar and harmonica) famous in the streets of Europe, and was an early busker to enter the Top Ten of the UK Singles Chart, with his hit singles [...] "Rosie" [...] and [...] "Blue Eyes" [...] in 1968. Modern one-man bands include such performers as Ben de la Garza, [...] Hasil Adkins and Sterling Magee, better known as [...] "Mister Satan," [...] from Satan and Adam.|$|R

5000|$|An arcade {{edition of}} Bust a Groove (Bust a Move) was {{exclusively}} released in Japan. Although released only in Japan, it held {{the title of}} Bust a Groove which is the English release title. The controls are still the same from the PlayStation version but changed how to execute them. The player now has to press the giant Left, Up and Right buttons in a giant pad and step on a <b>footpedal</b> for the 'Down' command while the PlayStation buttons (Square, X etc.), are replaced by a giant [...] "Dance!" [...] button. The buttons also had to be pressed in a rhythmic manner or still be counted as a [...] "miss". A Jammer button was also included.|$|E
50|$|In {{comparison}} with the <b>footpedal</b> activated service brake, the parking brake itself is a less critical item, and unless it is {{being used as a}} one-time backup for the footbrake, will not cause immediate danger if it is found to be nonfunctional at the moment of application. Therefore, no redundancy is built into it per se (and it typically uses a cheaper, lighter, but less hardwearing cable actuation system), and it can suffice, if this happens on a hill, to use the footbrake to momentarily hold the vehicle still, before driving off to find a flat piece of road on which to stop. Alternatively, on shallow gradients, the transmission can be shifted into Park, Reverse or First gear, and the transmission lock / engine compression used to hold it stationary, as {{there is no need for}} them to include the sophistication to first bring it to a halt.|$|E

50|$|On motorcycles, {{a similar}} level of fail-safety is {{provided}} by simpler methods; firstly {{the front and rear}} brake systems being entirely separate, regardless of their method of activation (that can be cable, rod or hydraulic), allowing one to fail entirely whilst leaving the other unaffected. Secondly, the rear brake is relatively strong compared to its automotive cousin, even being a powerful disc on sports models, even though the usual intent is for the front system to provide the vast majority of braking force; as the overall vehicle weight is more central, the rear tyre is generally larger and grippier, and the rider can lean back to put more weight on it, therefore allowing more brake force to be applied before the wheel locks up. On cheaper, slower utility-class machines, even if the front wheel should use a hydraulic disc for extra brake force and easier packaging, the rear will usually be a primitive, somewhat inefficient, but exceptionally robust rod-actuated drum, thanks to the ease of connecting the <b>footpedal</b> to the wheel in this way and, more importantly, the near impossibility of catastrophic failure even if the rest of the machine, like a lot of low-priced bikes after their first few years of use, is on the point of collapse from neglected maintenance.|$|E
5000|$|Effects {{processors}} play {{a crucial}} role in achieving Anastasio's guitar tone. He uses effects such as two Ibanez TS-9 Tube Screamers (with Analogman's Silver Mod) in sequence, the famous Univibe clone the Black Cat Vibe, and a Ross compressor. He switched to Analogman's Bicompressor around 1998, dropped the compressor from his rig in 2002, and resumed use the Ross Compressor in 2008 when a group of fans who desired the return of Anastasio's [...] "signature" [...] Ross compressor sound pooled their resources to obtain a vintage Ross Compressor and sent it to Anastasio in an attempt to compel him to return the vintage effect pedal to his rig. Anastasio responded through friend and longtime collaborator Tom Marshall's website explaining that he had lost his original Ross Compressor and that he was so touched that people cared about his effects and guitar tone that he would add the gift to his rig in the original configuration where it has remained ever since. He also uses a wah wah pedal (usually a Real McCoy Custom 3 by Geoffrey Teese), a Boomerang phrase sampler, Custom Audio Electronics Super Tremolo, Ibanez DM2000 delay, Alesis Microverb II (set to reverse), Whammy II pitch shifter, as well as a Leslie rotating speaker horn. In 2009, Anastasio added a Nova Repeater (delay). He controls these devices singularly or in batch with a Custom Audio Electronics RS-10 <b>footpedal</b> bank.|$|E

The magnitude and direction of the target–distractor congruency eVect was measured as participants adopted one of two diVerent postures with each hand (palm-up or palm-down).

40|$|The paper {{describes}} the implications and lessons learnt from the 2003 Waterfall train accident, particularly {{in relation to}} onboard driver safety systems such as deadman and vigilance monitoring devices. The implications for organisations in ensuring that safety critical workers are fit for duty and trained to detect and manage errors are discussed. From investigations into the Waterfall accident it was identified that there existed a number of inadequacies with the Tangara deadman system, in its efficacy to detect driver incapacitation. There was {{the potential for the}} deadman system to fail to initiate braking due to driver incapacitation in over 40 % of the driver population. In addition to these observations, a range of methods to circumvent the system were identified, including wedging a flag pole to keep the <b>footpedal</b> depressed. In an attempt to determine whether driver population and circumvention issues were an isolated NSW artefact, surveys were conducted with 112 suburban drivers in metropolitan Melbourne. While circumvention issues were not raised specifically...|$|E
40|$|For many years, {{researchers}} {{have argued that}} we have separate attentional resources for the processing of information impinging on each of our sensory receptor systems. However, {{a number of recent}} studies have demonstrated the existence of shared attentional resources for the processing of auditory, visual and tactile stimuli. In the present study, we examined whether there are also common attentional resources for the processing of chemosensory stimuli. Participants made speeded (left vs. right) <b>footpedal</b> discrimination responses to an unpredictable sequence of visual and chemosensory stimuli presented to either nostril. The participants' attention was directed to one or the other modality by means of a symbolic auditory cue (high or low tone) at the start of each trial, which predicted the likely modality for the upcoming target on the majority (80 %) of trials. Participants responded more rapidly when the target occurred in the expected modality than when it occurred in the unexpected modality, implying the existence of shared attentional resources for the processing of chemosensory and visual stimuli...|$|E
40|$|Several {{recent studies}} have {{provided}} support for the view that tactile stimuli/events are remapped into an abstract spatial frame of reference beyond the initial somatotopic representation present in the primary somatosensory cortex. Here, we demonstrate {{for the first time}} that the extent to which this remapping of tactile stimuli takes place is dependent upon the particular demands imposed by the task that participants have to perform. Participants in the present study responded to either the elevation (up vs. down) or to the anatomical location (finger vs. thumb) of vibrotactile targets presented to one hand, while trying to ignore distractors presented simultaneously to the other hand. The magnitude and direction of the target-distractor congruency effect was measured as participants adopted one of two different postures with each hand (palm-up or palm-down). When the participants used <b>footpedal</b> responses (toe vs. heel; Experiment 1), congruency effects were determined by the relative elevation of the stimuli in external coordinates (same vs. different elevation), regardless of whether the relevant response feature was defined externally or anatomically. Even when participants responded verbally (Experiment 2), the influence of the relative elevation of the stimuli in external space, albeit attenuated, was still observed. However, when the task involved responding with the stimulated finger (four-alternative forced choice; Experiment 3), congruency effects were virtually eliminated. These findings support the view that tactile events can be remapped according to an abstract frame of reference resulting from multisensory integration, but that the frame of reference that is used while performing a particular task may depend to a large extent on the nature of the task demands...|$|E
40|$|For {{grasping}} {{and fine}} motor tasks, a „functionality bias‟ within peripersonal space means that participants respond faster to stimuli in the „actable‟ {{side of their}} hand, that is, the palm side. Visual features of the hand, comprising a range of physio-anatomical characteristics, could strongly influence this functionality bias by interacting with comparative proprioceptive input. This was investigated through examining multisensory integration in a visuotactile congruency task. Visual LEDs and tactile distractors were activated either congruently (matching) or incongruently (mismatching). Inputs were matched or mismatched temporally through combinations of one or three flashes of either the LEDs or tactors. Participants responded via <b>footpedal</b> to LEDs positioned to both {{the right and left}} of the hand. In experiment one, either the right or left hand and arm were obscured by a box and curtain, abolishing detailed vision of the hand while retaining proprioceptive input. It was expected that multisensory integration, and thus the effect of visuotactile congruency, would still be greater in palmar space than dorsal (non-palmar) space due to retained proprioceptive feedback. In experiment two, a picture of a hand was put on top of the box in either a matching position (spatially congruent) or a mirrored, „reversed‟ position (spatially incongruent). The crossmodal congruency effect was produced in both experiments but the graspability bias was not. This thesis highlights the potentially crucial importance of visual properties of the hand in the production of the graspability bias. Issues relating to roles of both the attentional context as well as the spatial and temporal congruency of multisensory integration of visual and tactile signals are discussed. The current set of experiments gives insight into the role of vision and proprioception as the basis for body schema, most critically concerning their roles in the graspability bias of the hand...|$|E
