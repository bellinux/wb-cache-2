5000|$|<b>Heat-shrinkable</b> <b>sleeve</b> (or {{commonly}} [...] "shrink sleeve") is a corrosion {{protective coating}} for pipelines {{in the form}} of a wraparound or tubular sleeve that is field-applied.|$|E
5000|$|Heat-shrinkable means just that, heat them up {{and they}} shrink, or more correctly, they recover in length. A <b>heat-shrinkable</b> <b>sleeve</b> starts out with a thick {{extruded}} poly olefin sheet (polyethylene or polypropylene) that is formulated to be cross-linkable. After extruding the thick sheet, it is taken to the “beam” where it is passed under a unit that subjects the sheet to electron irradiation. [...] The irradiation process cross-links the polyolefin. This improves the molecular structure such that the polyolefin will work {{as part of a}} <b>heat-shrinkable</b> <b>sleeve</b> and provide the required level of mechanical protection while in-service. It makes the polyolefin perform more like a tough, heat-resistant, elastic material or rubber, rather than like a plastic material.|$|E
50|$|As {{described}} above, the <b>heat-shrinkable</b> <b>sleeves</b> have an adhesive {{that sticks}} the sleeve to the cutback and the factory applied mainline coating and also {{acts as a}} corrosion protective layer. The backing provides mechanical protection against abrasion and soil stress forces after the pipeline is buried.|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} testing of {{polymeric}} <b>heat-shrinkable</b> <b>sleeves</b> used for forming the fixed joints of pipe-lines {{are presented in}} the article. During the production sleeves of this type are exposed to radiation and orienting drawdown. It was determined the dependence of the performance characteristics of <b>heat-shrinkable</b> <b>sleeves</b> on the technological parameters of their production, in particular {{on the nature of}} the used polymer material and the exposure degree after molding. Quality assessment of the obtained sleeves was assessed by such indicators as the degree of crosslinking of the material in the product, the degree of parison swell of products after conducting the orientation (drawing), and the force and pressure of compression of pipe-shells by sleeves. The mode to obtain sleeves with an excellent set of operational characteristics is determined in the work...|$|R
50|$|The first <b>heat-shrinkable</b> <b>sleeves</b> were {{introduced}} over 35 {{years ago when}} polyethylene pipeline coatings started to replace bituminous or tape coatings in {{the oil and gas}} industry. Back then, the processing for polyethylene to make the sleeve backing was new technology and the adhesives used in sleeves were much the same as those used on pipeline coatings.|$|R
50|$|A final {{component}} is an optional epoxy primer. Primers for <b>heat-shrinkable</b> <b>sleeves</b> {{work in the}} same manner as an FBE primer does when it is specified on 3-layer polyolefin pipeline coatings and is typically applied between 150 µm and 300 µm thick. Usually, the primer of heat shrinkable sleeve is two components non-solvent Epoxy, one is primer base and the other is curing agent.|$|R
50|$|When steel {{pipelines}} are built, they commonly {{consist of}} 10~12m long sections of steel pipe {{that has had}} a corrosion protective coating applied to it in a factory. The factory will leave an uncoated area {{at each end of}} the pipe called a “cutback” so that when welding the pipe sections together, the coating is not damaged. <b>Heat-shrinkable</b> <b>sleeves</b> are applied onto the cutback at the field weld or “field joint” during the construction of a pipeline.|$|R
30|$|Starting {{friction}} {{would be}} induced and preserved {{somewhere along the}} seabed route of cased insulated flowlines (CIF) when the pipe carries service loads. The axial pipe-soil interaction {{can be divided into}} three pipe sections: the sliding section, the fixed section and the starting friction section. Although limited to a relatively small length of the pipe, the pipe coats of the starting friction section would suffer much higher shear force caused by thermal expansion than those of the sliding section or the fixed section. Based on the axial equilibrium equation of this kind of insulated pipeline, we developed a method for checking the shear force on CIF coats and their interfaces. The typical example shows that starting friction effect should be taken into account when checking the lap shear strength of <b>heat-shrinkable</b> <b>sleeves</b> on CIF field joints.|$|R
40|$|Damage {{effects of}} {{electron}} irradiation with different energy on mechanical properties of polyethylene <b>heat-shrinkable</b> <b>sleeves</b> were studied by irradiating the sleeves with 45 keV, 1 MeV and 2 MeV electrons respectively. The mechanical property degradations of the sleeves {{before and after}} radiations were present. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were {{used to analyze the}} element contents, the morphologies and the molecular structures of the samples to study the damage mechanism of the sleeves. A degradation model for the changes of the mechanical properties of the sleeves in electron radiation environment was proposed. It is shown that the increase of irradiation degradation of the polyethylene causes the sleeves' mechanical properties. For the penetration depth of different energy electrons in polyethylene is different, only a shallow layer the sleeves is affected by 45 keV energy electrons, while 1 MeV and 2 MeV energy electrons are penetrated the sleeves and cause the sleeves great damage. The mechanical properties of the sleeves are decreased by about 30 % to 40 % after 45 keV energy electron irradiation, and decreased by about 100 % after 1 MeV and 2 MeV energy electron irradiation...|$|R
40|$|A {{process has}} been {{developed}} for fabricating uniaxial filament-reinforced epoxy tubes. The process utilizes hand layup techniques, a Teflon mandrel, and a <b>heat-shrinkable</b> Teflon <b>sleeve.</b> At the present, over 40 tubes of boron-epoxy and S-glass-epoxy have been fabricated using the process reported herein. The tubes are essentially void free, exhibit less dimensional variation than the tolerances set for commercially available extruded aluminum tubing, and display a smooth surface finish. Short sections of both types of tubing {{have been subjected to}} axial compression tests. The boron-epoxy and S-glass-epoxy tubes exhibited average strengths of 309 ksi (2. 13 GN/m 2) and 207 ksi (1. 43 GN/m 2), respectively...|$|R
40|$|The article {{explains}} a new method of relief marking of <b>heat-shrinkable</b> tubing and <b>sleeves</b> made of polymer materials with “shape memory effect. ” Method of instrument evaluation of relief marking stereometry of installation parts for aviation equipment, made of polyvinyl chloride, polyethyleneterephthalate and polystyrene {{was developed and}} the results were explained. Parameters of pin-point relief marking and compliance of point forms to the Braille font standard were determined {{with the use of the}} non-destructive method based on the color of interference pattern with precision of 0. 02 mm...|$|R
