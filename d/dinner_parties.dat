Charlotte {{spent much of}} her time socialising with other ladies, where it was common to pursue activities such as skating, gossiping, and holding <b>dinner</b> <b>parties.</b> She was admired for her fashion sense, having imported all of her clothing from Paris. Charlotte also smoked and drank, and was liked by many for hosting entertaining parties. She earned a reputation as a gossip, and many found her acid-tongued; she was known for befriending someone and earning their confidence, only to spread their secrets to others.|$|E

Cooper owned several works by Pablo Picasso, whom he met in 1956. Cooper also had a lifelong passion for automobiles, with a collection that included a 1930 Duesenberg.|$|E

5|$|From its inception, the Waldorf Astoria gained {{international}} renown for its lavish <b>dinner</b> <b>parties</b> and galas, {{often at}} the center of political and business conferences and fundraising schemes involving the rich and famous. Particularly after World War II it {{played a significant role in}} world politics and the Cold War, culminating in the controversial World Peace Conference of March 1949 at the hotel, in which Stalinism was widely denounced. Conrad Hilton acquired management rights to the hotel on October 12, 1949, and the Hilton Hotels Corporation finally bought the hotel outright in 1972. It underwent a $150 million renovation by Lee Jablin in the 1980s and early 1990s, and in October 2014 it was announced that the Anbang Insurance Group of China had purchased the Waldorf Astoria New York for US$1.95 billion, making it the most expensive hotel ever sold. On July 1, 2016, Anbang announced that it would convert some of the Waldorf's hotel rooms into condominiums, closing the hotel for a three-year renovation on March 1, 2017.|$|E
5|$|While {{the concept}} of only eating locally grown food is not new, the book coincided with the {{emerging}} popularity of the locavore movement and farmer's markets. Media outlets in North America examined the feasibility of only eating food produced locally, local food-themed events, and locavore groups. During World Food Day in 2006, playing off the popularity of Smith and MacKinnon's articles in The Tyee, the Vancouver City Hall held a 100-mile themed breakfast. Locavore groups have held local-only <b>dinner</b> <b>parties</b> and week-long challenges. Some restaurants and caterers offered 100-mile menus, one being The Herbfarm Restaurant in Woodinville, Washington. Some farmers, gardeners, or regional food producers began offering subscription services to deliver produce or urban farming or gardening services. The 100-mile diet spawned many variations to allow for various circumstances and motivations. Examples include the allowance of a few non-local items, like Barbara Kingsolver chose to include spices into her local diet, or expanding the geographic area to more convenient boundaries, like the economic region, or the entire state or province. A 'made-in-Manitoba' diet challenge led to a government Manitoba Food Charter recognizing and encouraging local food markets.|$|E

25|$|The {{first known}} European lotteries were held during the Roman Empire, mainly as an {{amusement}} at <b>dinner</b> <b>parties.</b> Each guest {{would receive a}} ticket, and prizes would often consist of fancy items such as dinnerware.
