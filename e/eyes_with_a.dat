5|$|This loss led Tiku to {{reinforce}} his men. The Torajan troops were armed with rifles, spears, boulders, swords, and chili pepper extract, sprayed into enemy <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> device called a tirik lada, or blowgun, to blind them. Tiku himself was {{armed with a}} Portuguese rifle, spear, and labo. He wore protective armour, a sepu (crotch guard), and a songkok with protrusions {{in the shape of}} buffalo horns, and carried a decorated shield. With his soldiers, Tiku dug pits filled with bamboo stakes along Dutch supply routes; those who wandered over the pits would fall in and be impaled. However, these were not enough to stop the advancing Dutch. On 17 October 1906, two more fortresses, Bamba Puang and Kotu, fell, after several unsuccessful Dutch attacks since June. As the campaign against Tiku, which had already lasted longer than most other campaigns in the occupation, was thought to undermine Dutch authority in Sulawesi, Governor-General J. B. van Heutsz dispatched Governor of Sulawesi Swart to personally lead the attack.|$|E

25|$|White is {{acceptable}} {{on the chest}} and toes. The presence of black guard hairs or ticking is not addressed in the AKC standard, although the elaboration of the AKC standard notes the amount of black or dark brown in the coat should not be excessive. The FCI standard states that excessive black hairs throughout the coat are highly undesirable. Ridgebacks sometimes have a dark mask. The dog's nose should be black or brown (liver) {{in keeping with the}} color of the dog. No other colored nose is permissible. The brown nose is a recessive gene. It is not as common as a black nose; some breeders believe the inclusion of brown noses in a breeding program is necessary for maintaining the vibrancy of the coat. The eyes should be round and should reflect the dog's color: dark <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> black nose, amber <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> brown (liver) nose. Ridgebacks have a strong, smooth tail, which is usually carried in a gentle curve backwards.|$|E

500|$|The Appaloosa is {{best known}} for its distinctive, {{preferred}} leopard complex-spotted coat. Spotting occurs in several overlay patterns on one of several recognized base coat colors. There are three other distinctive, [...] "core" [...] characteristics: mottled skin, striped hooves, and <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> white sclera. Skin mottling is usually seen around the muzzle, eyes, anus, and genitalia. Striped hooves are a common trait, quite noticeable on Appaloosas, but not unique to the breed. [...] The sclera is the part of the eye surrounding the iris; although all horses show white around the eye if the eye is rolled back, to have a readily visible white sclera with the eye in a normal position is a distinctive characteristic seen more often in Appaloosas than in other breeds. Because the occasional individual is born with little or no visible spotting pattern, the ApHC allows [...] "regular" [...] registration of horses with mottled skin plus {{at least one of the}} other core characteristics. Horses with two ApHC parents but no [...] "identifiable Appaloosa characteristics" [...] are registered as [...] "non-characteristic," [...] a limited special registration status.|$|E
500|$|The tail {{is usually}} {{shorter than the}} disc and bears one, {{sometimes}} two serrated stinging spines on the upper surface, about halfway along its length. It is broad and flattened until {{the base of the}} sting; after, it tapers rapidly and there is a prominent ventral fin fold running almost to the sting tip, as well as a low dorsal ridge. Dermal denticles are only found on the tail, with at least one thorn appearing on the tail base by a disc width of [...] Adults have a midline row of large, backward-pointing, spear-like thorns or flattened tubercles in front of the sting, as well as much smaller, conical thorns behind the sting covering the tail to the tip. The dorsal coloration is grayish brown, darkening towards the tip of the tail and above the <b>eyes,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> line of white pores flanking the head on either side. The underside is whitish, darkening towards the fin margins and beneath the tail. Albino individuals have been reported. The short-tail stingray is the largest stingray species, known to reach at least [...] in width, [...] in length, and [...] in weight. Reliable observers off New Zealand have reported sighting individuals almost [...] across. Mature females are about a third larger than mature males.|$|E

500|$|Generally {{short and}} shiny, the coat varies in colour {{according}} to subspecies. The western hartebeest is a pale sandy-brown, but {{the front of}} the legs are darker. The red hartebeest is a reddish-brown, with a dark face. Black markings can be observed on the chin, the back of the neck, shoulders, hips and legs; these are in sharp contrast with the broad white patches that mark its flanks and lower rump. The Lelwel hartebeest is a reddish tan. Coke's hartebeest is reddish to tawny in the upper parts, but has relatively lighter legs and rump. Lichtenstein's hartebeest is reddish brown, though the flanks are a lighter tan and the rump whitish. The Tora hartebeest is a dark reddish brown in {{the upper part of the}} body, the face, the forelegs and the rump, but the hindlegs and the underbelly are a yellowish white. The Swayne's hartebeest is a rich chocolate brown with fine spots of white that are actually the white tips of its hairs. Its face is black save for the chocolate band below the eyes. The shoulders and upper part of the legs are black. Fine textured, the body hair of the hartebeest is about [...] long. The hartebeest has preorbital glands (glands near the <b>eyes)</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> central duct, that secrete a dark sticky fluid in Coke's and Lichtenstein's hartebeest, and a colourless fluid in the Lelwel hartebeest.|$|E
500|$|For Chris Bennion, {{writing in}} The Independent, {{the events of}} [...] "The 12 Days of Christine" [...] are a life review; the viewer shares Christine's visions of her life as she lies dying. However, like Christine, the viewer does not realise this until the end. For Bennion, Christine does not merely relive key moments of her life, but {{attempts}} to [...] "snatch at lost moments" [...] as she longs [...] "for second chances". Julie McDowall, who reviewed the episode for The Herald, also considers the viewer [...] "totally immersed in one character's confused and flawed point of view". She argued that [...] "there was no thunderclap moment when the story's twist is spectacularly revealed. There was just the slow and terrible realisation which we shared with Christine. We were with her, thinking 'Oh god no, not that. Don't let it be that!'" [...] Ultimately, claims McDowall, the oddities and confusion in the episode's plot is revealed to be the product of Christine's [...] "brain slowly fading, her memories blinking out, light by light, into darkness". Phoebe-Jane Boyd, whose review of the episode was published on entertainment website Den of Geek, likewise saw the episode as Christine's life flashing before her <b>eyes,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> variety of elements {{from the scene of}} the crash—police cars, car sounds, the song on the radio—indicative of [...] "her consciousness ... becoming muddled as parts of the car accident crash through into her memories".|$|E
500|$|Sora {{was planned}} as an {{artificial}} intelligence from the start, but because Uchikoshi thought robots seemed cliche, and holograms {{could not move}} around to different places, {{he came up with}} the idea of her being an image shot onto people's <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> laser; thinking that if a layman like himself could come up with the idea of such technology, an expert in the field could have been working on developing it already, so he researched it and found out about retinal scanning display technology, and made use of it in the game's story. The full names of both the original You and her clone were taken from a name dictionary, and were initially challenged by KID's marketing team, who thought they sounded [...] "lame"; they relented after Nakazawa explained that the names had a meaning and could not be changed. Because Uchikoshi liked the film Interview with the Vampire, he conceived Tsugumi as being a vampire; the staff did not like this idea, so it was scrapped, but the concept of her being immortal was kept, which led to the introduction of the Curé Virus in the story, as Uchikoshi considered the spreading of vampirism similar to a virus. Another remnant of the vampire concept was kept in Sara, who has infrared vision and can see in the dark. Sara was noted by Uchikoshi as being the otherwise single [...] "normal" [...] person in the cast, offsetting the balance; because of this, she was made into the Kid's twin sister.|$|E
