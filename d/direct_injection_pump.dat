40|$|Earlier {{systems for}} <b>direct</b> <b>injection</b> of plant {{protection}} products (PPP) did not satisfy the requirements of practical farming because of time lag between dosing of PPP and its application and because of cleaning problems. To offer solutions in this respect, a prototype field sprayer with <b>direct</b> <b>injection</b> for site-specific application was conceived, constructed and tested. This prototype has three separate nozzle lines, {{each with its own}} <b>direct</b> <b>injection</b> unit capable of preloading with individual spray mixture so that no time lag occurs in application. Calculated were the theoretically achievable working widths possible with the applied <b>direct</b> <b>injection</b> dosing <b>pumps.</b> Test stand measurements were carried out to determine dosing precision. The results show that good dosing precision is achieved in the different settings. Hereby, attention should be paid to the working range of the dosing pumps. The results show that practically-applicable systems for <b>direct</b> <b>injection</b> without time lag based on the developed prototype are possible offering the ability to apply PPP more precisely and site-specifically...|$|R

50|$|The first {{automotive}} <b>direct</b> <b>injection</b> {{system used}} to run on gasoline was developed under Hans Scherenbergâ€™s leadership, and was introduced by Goliath and Gutbrod in 1952 to power some of their two-stroke cars. This system made by Bosch was basically a high-pressure diesel direct-injection pump with an intake throttle valve set up. (Diesels only change the amount of fuel injected to vary output; there is no throttle.) It used a normal gasoline fuel pump, to provide fuel to a mechanically driven <b>injection</b> <b>pump,</b> which had separate plungers per injector to deliver a very high injection pressure directly into the combustion chamber. The two-stroke vehicles showed very good performance and up to 30% less fuel consumption over the carburetor version, primarily under low engine loads. The cars enjoyed an extra benefit as the injection system also metered lubricant into the engine from a dedicated oil tank, obviating the need for owners to mix their own two-stroke fuel blend. A portion of the oil was combined with fuel in the <b>injection</b> <b>pump</b> to lubricate the cylinders and piston rings, the rest was ported to the air intake to lubricate the crankcase. But the cars were expensive and difficult to start when the engine was warm due to vapor locks. Also, very few people knew about <b>direct</b> <b>injection,</b> and the <b>injection</b> <b>pumps</b> needed frequent adjustment. Branded repair shops and Bosch services became overloaded, and many cars were converted to carburetor. These two-stroke engines were soon superseded by four-strokes.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine is}} water-cooled, and is {{produced}} using cast-iron cylinder block, with cast-in cylinders.

Interestingly, exhaust ports 2&3 and 4&5 are siamesed together, presenting an exhaust manifold with only four outlets.|$|R

These engines were installed instead of the non-electronically controlled Bosch HPVE <b>Direct</b> <b>Injection</b> Rover MDi / Perkins Prima used in the Austin Maestro and Montego, because that engine, with its noisy combustion but lower fuel consumption, was deemed too unrefined for the new models.|$|R

This system used a normal gasoline fuel pump, to provide fuel to a mechanically driven <b>injection</b> <b>pump,</b> which had separate plungers per injector to deliver a very high injection pressure directly into the combustion chamber. The 1954 Mercedes-Benz W196 Formula 1 racing car engine used Bosch <b>direct</b> <b>injection</b> derived from wartime aircraft engines. Following this racetrack success, the 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300SL, the first production sports car to use fuel <b>injection,</b> used <b>direct</b> <b>injection.</b> The 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300SLR, in which Stirling Moss drove to victory in the 1955 Mille Miglia and Pierre Levegh crashed and died in the 1955 Le Mans disaster, had an engine developed from the W196 engine. The Bosch fuel injectors were placed into the bores on the cylinder wall used by the spark plugs in other Mercedes-Benz six-cylinder engines (the spark plugs were relocated to the cylinder head). Later, more mainstream applications of fuel injection favored the less-expensive indirect injection methods.|$|R

50|$|The {{fuel system}} is a very simple design. A {{mechanical}} or electric fuel lift pump feeds a Stanadyne Rotary Distributor <b>Injection</b> <b>pump</b> at low pressure.

50|$|A Hesselman {{engine is}} {{basically}} a spark-ignition engine, converted to run on heavier petroleum products such as oil, kerosene or diesel oil. The fuel is injected into the combustion chamber using an <b>injection</b> <b>pump.</b> Because of the engine's low compression the fuel must be ignited by a spark plug, unlike the diesel engine, where the fuel ignites spontaneously by the heat generated by the high compression ratio. Hesselman engines were often started on gasoline and then switched to diesel or kerosene when at working temperature. Clearing the heavy oil for the next start was achieved by switching back to gasoline before stopping. It is the first spark ignition engine for automotive use with <b>direct</b> <b>injection</b> of fuel into the cylinder.|$|R

The main focus {{of this study is}} to predict the effect of the size of the pipeline on the cross flow injection process.

The main parameter tested was the injection dose capacity at different pump displacements.

Results show that increasing the size of the pipeline increases <b>injection</b> <b>pump</b> doses ability. This effect is insignificant at lower <b>injection</b> <b>pump</b> displacements, while the effect of the size of the pipeline becomes dominant when increasing the displacement.

The aim of plant protection is to apply plant protection products (PPP) according to the site specific requirements on the field. Within {{the context of a}} research program to promote innovation, a sprayer with <b>direct</b> <b>injection</b> of plant protection products was developed. The <b>direct</b> <b>injection</b> offers site specific spraying of different individual PPP in a single pass. The sprayer prototype is equipped with a special spray boom combining three nozzle lines. In order to prevent delay times, the nozzle lines are preloaded before spraying. First results for weed control from test stand measurements and field trials showed that the <b>injection</b> <b>pumps</b> work with high accuracy. The prototype can be used without delay times site specific with up to three different herbicides. Field trials for site-specific weed control in winter wheat demonstrate the applicability of the system under practical conditions. By treatment of subareas herbicides and therefore costs could be saved. A reduction in yield compared with the conventionally treated field areas could not be ascertained. Also an efficacy reduction through washout of active ingredient from target surfaces due to simultaneous use of all three nozzle lines with up to 1050 l/ha application rate could not be detected. At high water spray rates, the efficacy effect occurs delayed. Overall, the newly developed <b>direct</b> <b>injection</b> system proved fieldabillity during the first tests. So weed control can be carried out situation-responsive, which can save herbicides and environmental impacts are reduced...|$|R
