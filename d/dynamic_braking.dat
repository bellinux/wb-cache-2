25|$|The {{armature}} of each {{traction motor}} is connected across a forced-air-cooled resistance grid (the <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking</b> grid) {{in the roof}} of the locomotive's hood.|$|E
25|$|The trams had {{a primary}} <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking</b> {{controlled}} through 12 stages. There are also pnumatic drum brakes, {{although they are}} only used for parking, braking form the back end and for a passenger-induced emergency brake. The MO units were instead equipped with clasp brakes controlled by pneumatics. Trailers were equipped with solenoid brakes, but lacked a parking brake as {{it was found that}} the motor unit's holding brake was sufficient., In addition all units had an emergency rail brake. The trams were connected with Albert couplers.|$|E
50|$|Although the GP20D is {{marketed as}} a switcher, {{it has a}} top speed of 70 mph, and is usually fitted with <b>dynamic</b> <b>brakes,</b> making it {{suitable}} for road switcher duties as well. The similar appearing EMD GP15D does not have <b>dynamic</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Since EMD {{wanted the}} new {{locomotive}} to be visibly modern and updated, {{they turned to}} the GM Automotive Styling Center at Troy, Michigan for help. The automobile stylists created the GP30's trademark [...] "hump" [...] and cab roof profile. The hump-like bulge started {{at the front of}} the cab and enveloped the air intakes for the central air system and the <b>dynamic</b> <b>brake</b> blister.

25|$|In {{heavy-duty}} industrial high-current applications, a grid resistor {{is a large}} convection-cooled lattice of {{stamped metal}} alloy strips connected in rows between two electrodes. Such industrial grade resistors can be {{as large as a}} refrigerator; some designs can handle over 500 amperes of current, with a range of resistances extending lower than 0.04 ohms. They are used in applications such as <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking</b> and load banking for locomotives and trams, neutral grounding for industrial AC distribution, control loads for cranes and heavy equipment, load testing of generators and harmonic filtering for electric substations.|$|E
25|$|In normal {{operation}} for locomotive/carriage trains, on descending and level running, {{the train is}} normally braked (service braking) using the locomotive. This uses compression braking – the energy is absorbed by using the cylinders as pumps, then dumping the pressure, similar to a Jake brake – on steam locomotives, hydraulic braking on the diesel locomotives. The diesel-electric railcars were service braked using hydraulic brakes and <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking,</b> during which power was dissipated in roof-mounted resistors, creating a distinct heat shimmer when the vehicles were descending and shortly afterwards. The hand brakes are used to bring a train to a complete stand from low speed, and as a parking brake.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the main}} line and the New Canaan Branch are {{equipped}} with 12.5 kV 60 Hz overhead catenary, {{as opposed to just}} the 750 V DC third rail of the Hudson and Harlem Lines, different rolling stock that can operate with either power system runs on the New Haven Line. This rolling stock, originally produced by General Electric in two batches (144 in 1972–73 and 100 in 1975–77), was initially branded as the M2 Cosmopolitan, with later versions being made on license by Tokyu Car (model M4, 1988) and Morrison-Knudsen (model M6, 1994). Cosmopolitans can be easily spotted by their red stripe along the side, the presence of pantographs on the lead cars in each set, and a <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking</b> grid on the roof.|$|E

The motor cars had a capacity for 38 passengers and a maximum speed of [...] Because of the steep gradients, the units had a low weight combined with high power output, and had both track brakes and <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking.</b> They were originally given road numbers 18505 though 18507, but this was later changed to 64.05 through 64.07.|$|E
500|$|For every , {{the tracks}} at the Horseshoe Curve bend 9degrees and 15minutes {{with the entire}} curve totaling 220degrees. The curve is [...] long and, at its widest, about [...] across. The Horseshoe Curve descends from an {{approximate}} elevation of [...] on the southern side to [...] on the northern. The grade of the curve was listed by the Pennsylvania Railroad as 1.45percent, and currently as 1.34percent by Norfolk Southern. Each track consists of , welded rails that were, , laid in 2011. Prior to dieselization {{and the introduction of}} <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking</b> and rail oilers, the rails along the curve would be transposedleft to right and vice versato equalize the wear on each rail from the flanges of passing steam locomotives and rail cars, thereby extending their lifespan.|$|E
500|$|In October 1973, Amtrak {{placed an}} order for 57 Amfleet coaches, {{the first of what}} would {{ultimately}} be a fleet of over 600. Although the Metroliner propulsion systems had proved unsuccessful, the carbodies were well-liked, and the Amfleet cars had the same basic structure. By November, the first two rebuilt cars had been completed and were waiting for legal agreements to enter testing. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking</b> resistors and the air intakes were relocated to a streamlined bump on the roof, reducing overheating and snow ingestion issues that had occurred when they were mounted under the carbody. The rebuilt cars had a maximum speed of [...] Two additional cars were completed by February 1974. All four rebuilt cars were tested at up to [...] in May and returned to revenue service as a four-car set on July 1. The rebuilding was largely successful except for continued issues with rough-riding trucks, but it cost $500k per car - more than the original cost of $450k each.|$|E

500|$|Each Iore {{consists}} of twin units with one driver's cab at each. They normally operate in fixed units of two, making a pair capable of hauling a [...] ore train. Technically an Iore section is also capable {{to operate as}} single locomotive, an option that is seldom used in operation. The units are fed with [...] via a pantograph. The power is transformed and then converted via a single water-cooled gate turn-off (GTO) thyristor based converter per bogie. The converters belong to the Camilla family, which was developed by ABB's Swiss branch as successor for its oil-cooled converters, and found previous use in the FS Class E464. The converters operate independently, with their own cooling and control systems and are shut down automatically in case of failure. The converters consist of seven line-replaceable unit modules to minimize maintenance costs. Each locomotive has six three-phase asynchronous alternating current traction motors, each rated at [...] and each powering a single axle. This gives a Co′Co′ wheel arrangement. The tractive effort of each locomotive is [...] and the maximum <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking</b> effort is [...] There is also a boost function, allowing a temporary traction effort of [...] The units are capable of [...] in single runs, [...] with empty trains and [...] with loaded trains.|$|E

5000|$|The {{locomotive}} {{could be}} ordered {{with either a}} steam generator for steam heat, or <b>dynamic</b> <b>brakes</b> contained within the short hood. McCloud River Railroad No. 32 and 33 {{were the only two}} ordered with <b>dynamic</b> <b>brakes</b> of the fifty units built. One survives and is preserved in operational condition in the [...] "Skunk Train" [...] livery of California Western 56 (Locomotive) at Travel Town Museum in Griffith Park.|$|R
5000|$|What are {{described}} as <b>dynamic</b> <b>brakes</b> ("rheostatic brakes" [...] in the UK) on electric traction systems, unlike regenerative brakes, dissipate electric energy as heat rather than using it, by passing the current through large banks of variable resistors. Vehicles that use <b>dynamic</b> <b>brakes</b> include forklift trucks, diesel-electric locomotives, and trams. This heat {{can be used to}} warm the vehicle interior, or dissipated externally by large radiator-like cowls to house the resistor banks.|$|R
5000|$|For {{operation}} on ramps its availability was indispensable because these <b>dynamic</b> <b>brakes</b> on steam locomotives provided the required third independent set of brakes.|$|R
2500|$|The {{aggregate}} {{effect of the}} above is to cause each traction motor to generate electric power and dissipate it as heat in the <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking</b> grid. [...] A fan connected across the grid provides forced-air cooling. [...] Consequently, the fan is powered by {{the output of the}} traction motors and will tend to run faster and produce more airflow as more energy is applied to the grid.|$|E
2500|$|Ultimately, {{the source}} of the energy {{dissipated}} in the <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking</b> grid is the motion of the locomotive as imparted to the traction motor armatures. [...] Therefore, the traction motors impose drag and the locomotive acts as a brake. [...] As speed decreases, the braking effect decays and usually becomes ineffective below approximately 16km/h (10mph), depending on the gear ratio between the traction motors and axles.|$|E
2500|$|In 1939 {{the company}} built a four-unit freight {{locomotive}} demonstrator, the FT, {{and began a}} tour of the continent's railroads. The tour was a success. Western railroads in particular saw that the Diesels could free them from dependence on scarce water supplies for steam locomotives. [...] In 1940, after incorporating <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking</b> at the suggestion of customers, they were receiving their first orders for the new freight locomotive.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the last}} C-liners built by CLC for Canadian National Railways (CPA-16-5 #6700–6705 and CPB-16-5 #6800–6805) had General Electric {{equipment}} and lacked <b>dynamic</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R

50|$|In 1968 the Western Australian Government Railways took {{delivery}} of five narrow gauge {{versions of the}} K class for use on bauxite traffic, the last three were fitted with 6 t of ballast to improve their tractive effort. All were fitted with <b>dynamic</b> <b>brakes.</b> A further 11 were ordered, but without <b>dynamic</b> <b>brakes.</b> These were classified as the RA class. A further two RAs were financed by the Lefroy Salt Company for use over a 13 km off the Esperance line.|$|R
2500|$|Analog meter {{movements}} are inherently more fragile physically and electrically than digital meters. Many analog multimeters feature a range switch position marked [...] "off" [...] {{to protect the}} meter movement during transportation which places placing a low resistance across the meter movement, resulting in <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking.</b> Meter movements as separate components may be protected {{in the same manner}} by connecting a shorting or jumper wire between the terminals when not in use. Meters which feature a shunt across the winding such as an ammeter may not require further resistance to arrest uncontrolled movements of the meter needle because of the low resistance of the shunt.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{testing in}} 1989 at Hudson, CO two ex-CSX [...] locomotives, an EMD GP40-2 and an EMD GP38-2, {{were sent to}} Precision National in Mount Vernon, IL for {{modification}} to GP40-2DE (<b>Dynamic</b> <b>braking,</b> Extended range) with bulletproof glass in the cab windows. The trains {{were expected to be}} in service within about 2 years. Strategic Air Command wanted the first trains stationed at F. E. Warren Air Force Base near the Union Pacific mainline at Cheyenne, WY. The expected in-service date was December 1992. Rail Garrisons would resemble small freight yards with four spurs leading to slant sided steel and earthen hardened shelters to house the trains.|$|E
2500|$|All trams except no. 117–120 were {{delivered}} with two NB80 motors from AEG. These {{each had a}} power output of , giving a combined effort of [...] No. 118–120 {{were delivered}} with the more powerful VNB120, each with a power output of , for a total [...] These were both bipolar serial direct current motors organized as a compound motor. This allowed the speed to be regulated through the altering of the three spools between series and shunts, predefined in seven switches. In addition they had switches for reverse and emergency breaking. Power was collected through a trolley pole. All units were delivered with clamp brakes for operation and a <b>dynamic</b> <b>braking</b> through shorting for emergencies.|$|E

25|$|To {{prevent a}} runaway due to loss of <b>brake</b> pressure, <b>dynamic</b> (rheostatic) <b>braking</b> can be {{utilized}} so the locomotive(s) will assist in retarding the train. Often, blended braking, the simultaneous application of <b>dynamic</b> and train <b>brakes,</b> {{will be used}} to maintain a safe speed and keep the slack bunched on descending grades. Care would then be given when releasing the service and <b>dynamic</b> <b>brakes</b> to prevent draw-gear damage caused by a sudden run out of the train's slack.|$|R
50|$|Transmission brakes use drum brakes, {{rather than}} disc brakes, {{as they are}} {{intended}} as a static parking brake, rather than a high performance <b>dynamic</b> <b>brake.</b> Drum brakes allow simpler adjustment with cable-actuated hand lever mechanisms. The brake is mounted to the rear output shaft of the transfer box.|$|R
