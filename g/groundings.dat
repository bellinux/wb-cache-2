5|$|Operational {{problems}} have been experienced and some have caused fleet-wide <b>groundings.</b> Critically, pilots have experienced a decreased mental status, including losing consciousness. There were reports of instances of pilots {{found to have a}} decreased level of alertness or memory loss after landing. F-22 pilots have experienced lingering respiratory problems and a chronic cough; other symptoms include irritability, emotional lability and neurological changes. A number of possible causes were investigated, including possible exposure to noxious chemical agents from the respiratory tubing, pressure suit malfunction, side effects from oxygen delivery at greater-than-atmospheric concentrations, and oxygen supply disruptions. Other problems include minor mechanical problems and navigational software failures. The fleet was grounded for four months in 2011 before resuming flight, but reports of oxygen issues persisted.|$|E

25|$|The International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation has tracked 9,351 {{accidental}} spills {{that have}} occurred since 1974. According to this study, most spills result from routine operations such as loading cargo, discharging cargo, and taking on fuel oil. 91% of the operational oil spills are small, resulting in less than 7 metric tons per spill. On the other hand, spills resulting from accidents like collisions, <b>groundings,</b> hull failures, and explosions are much larger, with 84% of these involving losses of over 700 metric tons.|$|E
25|$|<b>Groundings</b> was {{established}} by the Society in 2007 and has since been published annually. The purpose of the journal is to {{provide an opportunity for}} undergraduate students at the University to have their work peer-reviewed and published in an accessible academic resource as a stepping stone to publication in more mainstream scholarly journals. As such, all entries are written by undergraduate students, and the editorial board is made up of undergraduates, although there exists an advisory panel mainly comprising academics of the University drawn from a range of disciplines.|$|E
25|$|While {{there had}} been many shipwrecks and <b>groundings</b> over the years, {{and it was the}} rare vessel that did not run aground or have some problem of this nature, two shipwrecks would have been {{foremost}} in the minds of Captain Locke and his officers, as well as other senior captains and officers among the rescue vessels, like Captains Ledbetter of Cedar and Miller of the King and Winge. These two wrecks, of Clallam in 1904 and Princess May in 1910, showed well the dilemma faced by Captain Locke in making a decision whether to evacuate Princess Sophia.|$|E
25|$|One of the helmsman's most {{important}} duties is steering a ship in a harbor or seaport when reduced speeds slow a ship's {{response to the}} rudder. For it is during ship arrivals and departures, when most ship collisions or <b>groundings</b> occur. Clear communication, then, between the officer of the bridge and the helmsman is essential for safe operations. The officer or harbor pilot relies upon the helmsman to flawlessly execute steering commands to avoid a variety of hazards, including man-made obstacles, land formations, grounding in shallow waters, {{and the threat of}} collision with other vessels. In addition, powerful sea tides and river currents encountered in seaports heighten navigation dangers, as a ship's ability to stop is severely limited.|$|E
25|$|Tate was {{immediately}} and severely handicapped when the best pilots and 12 aircraft of the airlift went west to Egypt with Brereton on 26 June. Despite {{the use of}} the 1st Ferrying Group, the buildup of the airlift grew very slowly during the summer monsoon. Overuse of the small number of aircraft available, spotty maintenance, and a lack of spare parts led to numerous <b>groundings</b> until overhauls could be effected. In particular the lack of replacement tires and spare engines held down operations even after eight of the C-47s sent to the Middle East returned in August. For {{a short period of time}} engines intended for P-43 fighters of the Chinese Air Force were adapted for use on C-47s but the supply of those proved small.|$|E
25|$|Single- and double-engine engine flameouts {{plagued the}} program between June 1965 and July 1967, when fuel control {{problems}} were finally corrected. No aircraft were destroyed but one {{was out of}} service for six months after it crash-landed in a field near Albuquerque. By May 1968 stress cracks began appearing in the wing spars and ribs of all the RB-57Fs outboard of the main engines and numerous <b>groundings</b> forced the cancellation of many operational missions. Some aircraft were sent to General Dynamics for repairs but under Big Safari dicta the cost of repairing all of the aircraft was excessive and resulted in five being placed in storage at Davis-Monthan AFB in 1972 and another three in 1973. The remaining aircraft were retired in 1974. Each had accumulated on average a total of 3,000 hours of airframe life. The 58th WRS, the last squadron in the Air Force to use the WB-57F, was inactivated on 1 July 1974.|$|E
25|$|Storytelling is a {{means for}} sharing and {{interpreting}} experiences. Peter L. Berger says human life is narratively rooted, humans construct their lives and shape their world into homes in terms of these <b>groundings</b> and memories. Stories are universal in that they can bridge cultural, linguistic and age-related divides. Storytelling can be adaptive for all ages, leaving out the notion of age segregation. Storytelling {{can be used as}} a method to teach ethics, values and cultural norms and differences. Learning is most effective when it takes place in social environments that provide authentic social cues about how knowledge is to be applied. Stories function as a tool to pass on knowledge in a social context. So, every story has 3 parts. First, The setup (The Hero's world before the adventure starts). Second, The Confrontation (The hero's world turned upside down). Third, The Resolution (Hero conquer's villain, but it's not enough for Hero to survive. The Hero or World must be transformed). Any story can be framed in such format.|$|E

500|$|NTSB {{investigators}} {{noted that}} Fitzgeralds prior <b>groundings</b> {{could have caused}} undetected damage that led to major structural failure during the storm, since Great Lakes vessels were normally drydocked for inspection only once every five years. It was also alleged that when compared to Fitzgeralds previous captain, McSorley did {{not keep up with}} routine maintenance and did not confront the mates about getting the requisite work done. After August B. Herbel, Jr., president of the American Society for Testing and Materials, examined photographs of the welds on Fitzgerald, he stated, [...] "the hull was just being held together with patching plates." [...] Other questions were raised as to why the USCG did not discover and take corrective action in its pre-November 1975 inspection of Fitzgerald given that her hatch coamings, gaskets, and clamps were poorly maintained.|$|E
500|$|Biscayne Bay is {{a shallow}} lagoon with little {{vertical}} density or salinity gradient {{due to its}} lack of depth. Instead of a vertical gradient, the bay shows a horizontal density gradient, with fresh water entering from the drainage canals {{on the west side}} and seawater entering through gaps in the keys and through the safety valve section of shoals. Bay salinity reaches a peak in June. Changes in the salinity pattern of the bay have had negative effects on formerly abundant species such as red drum. Biscayne Bay and Florida Bay are major nurseries for red grouper and gray snapper. The bottom of the lagoon hosts sponges and soft corals in places where grasses cannot not grow. Three primary species of seagrass are found in the park: turtlegrass, shoal grass and manatee grass. The endangered Johnson's seagrass is also found in small quantities in the bay, which is {{at the southern end of}} the grass's range. Roughly 75 percent of the central bay floor is covered by grasses. Scarring of seagrass beds by vessel <b>groundings</b> or propellers is a significant problem. About 200 such incidents are documented each year, with full re-growth requiring up to 15 years. The bay is also affected by commercial shrimp trawling, which is permitted in park waters. [...] The passage of roller-frame trawl nets does not harm grasses, but damages soft corals and sponges.|$|E
500|$|George A. Johnson was {{instrumental}} in getting the support for Congressional funding a military expedition up the river. With those funds Johnson expected to provide the transportation for the expedition but was angry and disappointed when {{the commander of the}} expedition Lt. Joseph Christmas Ives rejected his offer of one of his steamboats. [...] Before Ives could finish reassembling his steamer in the delta, George A. Johnson set off from Fort Yuma on December 31, 1857, conducting his own exploration of the river above the fort in his steamboat General Jesup. [...] He ascended the river in twenty one days as far as the first rapids in Pyramid Canyon, over [...] above Fort Yuma and [...] above the modern site of Davis Dam. [...] Running low on food he turned back. [...] He as he returned he encountered Lieutenant Ives, Whipple's assistant, who was leading an expedition to explore the feasibility of using the Colorado River as a navigation route in the Southwest. [...] Ives and his men used a specially built steamboat, the shallow-draft U.S.S. Explorer, and traveled up the river as far as Black Canyon. [...] He then took a small boat up beyond the canyon to Fortification Rock and Las Vegas Wash. [...] After experiencing numerous <b>groundings</b> and accidents and having been inhibited by low water in the river, Ives declared: [...] "Ours has been the first, and will doubtless be the last, party of whites to visit this profitless locality. It seems intended by nature that the Colorado River, along the greater portion of its lonely and majestic way, shall be forever unvisited and undisturbed." ...|$|E
500|$|While Gambier hesitated, {{one by one}} the French {{ships which}} had {{grounded}} began to refloat, although several grounded again. As they had removed their topmasts before the attack, they had survived the <b>groundings</b> with less damage than might otherwise have been the case, and were easier to [...] kedge off. [...] Foudroyant and Cassard, fearing an attack by the British fleet, retreated up the Charente at 12:45 and both then grounded at Fouras. At 13:00, Cochrane, his impatience and fury rising, deliberately allowed Imperieuse to drift stern-first alone down the channel towards the French fleet, flying the signal [...] "The enemy's ships are getting under sail", followed by [...] "the enemy is superior to the chasing ship", and then at 13:45 [...] "the ship is in distress, and requires to be assisted immediately". He later wrote [...] "It was better to risk the frigate, or even my commission, than suffer a disgraceful termination to the expectations of the Admiralty". At 14:00 the frigate was within range of Calcutta and began a steady fire into the beached storeship, supported by Aetna and several of the sloops, which he ordered into position by the unexpected process of firing cannon in their direction until they had moved to the position he intended. Cochrane had forced Gambier's hand: despite his desire to avoid combat, the admiral could not allow one of his frigates to fight the entire French fleet single-handed, and reluctantly he instructed the large frigate HMS Indefatigable, the smaller Emerald, Unicorn, Aigle and Pallas and the ships of the line Valiant and Revenge, the latter now commanded by Captain Alexander Robert Kerr, to join with the inshore squadron, enter the Aix Roads and support Cochrane.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "grounding" [...] is used among Rastas {{to refer}} to the {{establishment}} of relationships between like-minded practitioners. <b>Groundings</b> often take place in a commune or yard, and are presided over by an elder.

Activities that take place at <b>groundings</b> include the playing of drums, chanting, the singing of hymns, and the recitation of poetry. Ganja, or cannabis, is often smoked. Most <b>groundings</b> contain only men, with women being excluded. Some Rasta women have established their own, all-female grounding circles.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first person}} to record Rasta music was Count Ossie, a drummer who {{believed}} that black people needed {{to develop their own}} style of music.

Ossie subsequently popularised this new Rastafari ritual music by playing at various <b>groundings</b> and groundations around Jamaica. By the 1960s, Rastafari had begun to influence Jamaican popular music, particularly through the work of Ossie and Don Drummond. Rasta ideas began to feature in the lyrics of mento songs, such as Lord Lebby's [...] "Ethiopia". Rasta ritual rhythms also began to be incorporated into reggae, and soon the genre also began to incorporate Rasta chants, language, motifs, and social critiques.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the central}} {{activities}} that takes place at <b>groundings</b> is [...] "reasoning". This is a discussion among assembled Rastas about the religion's principles and their relevance to current events. These discussions {{are supposed to be}} non-combative, although attendees can point out the fallacies in any arguments that are presented. Those assembled inform each other about the revelations that they have received through meditation and dream. Each contributor is supposed to push the boundaries of understanding until the entire group has gained greater insight into the topic under discussion. Cashmore observed that in England, Rastas arrived and left throughout the reasoning session. In meeting together with likeminded individuals, reasoning helps Rastas to reassure one another of the correctness of their beliefs.|$|E
