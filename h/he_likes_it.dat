Danny takes a shine to Jacqui and they share a couple of dates; during an interview Day brands Danny's attraction to Danny being down to her feisty manner adding: [...] "Jacqui stands up to him, and even though he's not used to it, I think <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> <b>it.</b> He's quite intrigued by the fact that she's so feisty and he likes that edginess about her." ...|$|E
500|$|Clarkson {{fought with}} her bosses to prevent [...] "Already Gone" [...] from being {{released}} as a single, {{out of respect}} for Knowles. She wanted [...] "Cry" [...] to be released instead, but conceded that, [...] "in the end, they’re releasing it without my consent. It sucks, but it's one of those things I have no control over... At this point, the record company can do whatever they want with it." [...] Tedder, however, was pleased that the song was released, saying that <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> <b>it</b> more than [...] "Halo". The song was sent to radio airplay on August 11, 2009. In September 2009, Clarkson told MTV that it was unfortunate the two songs sound exactly the same, but noted that they have different vocal melodies.|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, [...] "Lemonade" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Website Inverse's Winston Cook-Wilson praised the track for being complex. Cook-Wilson continued into {{saying that the}} recording [...] "is just something to sip {{on a hot day}} — also, a way to cool down when thinking about a loved one". Kevin Apaza, writing for Direct Lyrics labelled the single [...] "fresh and funky", confessing that <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> <b>it</b> better than its predecessors [...] "1.000.000" [...] (2012) and [...] "Get Back (ASAP)" [...] (2011). Furthermore, Apaza foreseed [...] "Lemonade" [...] as a club hit with the help of [...] "a few killer remixes". MTV declared the song as being [...] "catchy", while stating that [...] "you'd be hard-pressed to turn down a glass of what Stan’s serving this summer". Music channel Utv applauded the single, foreseeing it successful on radio. At the Radio România Actualități Awards gala in 2013, the recording received a nomination for Radio România Junior.|$|E
500|$|In 1979, the {{committees}} began the redistribution {{of land in}} the Jefara plain, continuing through 1981. In May 1980, measures to redistribute and equalize wealth were implemented; anyone with over 1000 dinar in their bank account saw that extra money expropriated. The following year, the GPC announced that the government would take control of all import, export and distribution functions, with state supermarkets replacing privately owned businesses; this led to a decline in the availability of consumer goods {{and the development of a}} thriving black market. Gaddafi was also frustrated by the slow pace of social reform on women's issues, and in 1979 launched a Revolutionary Women's Formation to replace the more gradualist Libyan General Women's Federation. In 1978 he had established a Women's Military Academy in Tripoli, encouraging all women to enlist for training. The measure was hugely controversial, and voted down by the GPC in February 1983. Gaddafi remained adamant, and when it was again voted down by the GPC in March 1984, he refused to abide by the decision, declaring that [...] "he who opposes the training and emancipation of women is an agent of imperialism, whether <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> <b>it</b> or not." ...|$|E
500|$|Straczynski {{described}} specific {{visual cues}} in the screenplay, {{such as in}} Sanford Clark's confession scene. Clark's flashback to a falling axe is juxtaposed with the crumbling ash from Detective Ybarra's cigarette. The image served two purposes: it was an aesthetic correlation between the axe and the cigarette, and it suggested that Ybarra was so shocked by Clark's confession {{that he had not}} moved or even smoked in the 10 minutes Clark took to tell his story. As with most of the cues, Eastwood shot the scene as written. To ensure the veracity of the story, Straczynski incorporated quotes from the historical record, including court testimony, into the dialogue. He also included photocopies of news clippings every 15–20 pages in the script to remind people the story was a true one. So the credits could present the film as [...] "a true story" [...] rather than as [...] "based on" [...] one, Straczynski went through the script with Universal's legal department, providing attribution for every scene. Straczynski believed the only research error he made was in a scene that referenced Scrabble, pre-dating its appearance on the market by two years. He changed the reference to a crossword puzzle. He did not alter the shooting script any further from his first draft; though Straczynski had written two more drafts for Howard, Eastwood insisted the first draft be filmed as he felt it had the clearest voice of the three. Straczynski said, [...] "Clint's funny—if <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> <b>it,</b> he'll do it, that's the end of the discussion. When I met with him to ask, 'Do you want any changes, do you want any things cut, added to, subtracted from, whatever', he said, 'No. The draft is fine. Let's shoot the draft.|$|E

2500|$|Death's Head {{appears in}} the first five issues of the S.W.O.R.D. ongoing series, hunting down Abigail Brand's brother. He was given a partial redesign, with his head having some {{elements}} from the Minion version, and is his original giant size. He is not using the term [...] "freelance peacekeeper" [...] until the Beast suggests it to him and Death's Head notes that <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> <b>it,</b> and he doesn't appear to be a time/dimensional traveler. This seems to indicate this is Death's Head before he met the Transformers and the human-sized, Bryan Hitch model Death's Head would appear separately in other comics.|$|E

Later, she goes to his workplace, buying him roasted sweet potato and visiting his house. There, she entertains his younger brothers and tells them she will be living there. She makes coffee for Tsun-chan and his father, and forgets to add sugar again.|$|E

2500|$|The initial Death's Head 3.0 story also {{included}} a number of elements which tied it into previous Amazing Fantasy stories - Death's Head's sentience and power source comes from AIM's attempts to first capture and then replicate the power that created Captain Universe. Issue #16 revealed the scientist that began the project was Monica Rappaccini, mother of the new Scorpion, {{on the back of}} her attempts to capture the Uni-Power in other titles. Varina Goddard is revealed via AIM records to be Monica's granddaughter. Furman says he has [...] "mixed feelings" [...] about the story, as <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> <b>it</b> but feels that this isn't Death's Head; “I always thought it strange that poll was to bring back one character and what readers got was another entirely... I’d have much rather done the original.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Co-stars Jodie Foster and Kate Winslet commented about Polanski's {{directing}} style. According to Foster, [...] "He has a very, very definitive style {{about how}} <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> <b>it</b> done. He decides everything. He decided every lens. Every prop. Everything. It's all him." [...] Winslet adds that [...] "Roman {{is one of}} the most extraordinary men I've ever met. The guy is 77 years old. He has an effervescent quality to him. He's very joyful about his work, which is infectious. He likes to have a small crew, to the point that, when I walked on the set, my thought was, 'My God, this is it?'” Also noting that style of directing, New York Film Festival director Richard Pena, during the American premiere of the film, called Polanski [...] "a poet of small spaces... in just a couple of rooms he can conjure up an entire world, an entire society." ...|$|E
2500|$|The USR's public {{expression}} of regret over having tolerated [...] "a text with antisemitic content" [...] caused Goma to threaten with a lawsuit on libel grounds. In reaction, Gârbea stated: [...] "What {{we are interested}} in is Viaţa Românească, a press organ edited by the USR. Paul Goma may believe whatever <b>he</b> <b>likes.</b> <b>It</b> is not him that we are discussing, but the magazine. I see no reason why he would sue me personally." [...] According to an overview of the episode by journalist Ovidiu Şimonca, Horia Gârbea had unwittingly prompted Goma to state his intention of suing the Jewish-Romanian community league, or Federation of Jewish Communities of Romania (FCER). This was because, during the scandal, Gârbea had explained that the FCER's reaction was an incentive in the USR's internal investigation. Goma's claim for reparations from FCER leaders, Şimonca noted, ignored the fact that Gârbea had not disclosed any names.|$|E

2500|$|To {{cure the}} disease, it is {{necessary}} to produce a spout of smoke by burning off thirty-six charms, and instruct the patient to inhale and to swallow up its fumes, whether <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> <b>it</b> or not. By the time all charms are used up, the smoke should also be dispersed. It may be difficult for the patient to bear the odour of the smoke at first, but once he gets used to such a smell, it does not really matter. Whenever the patient feels that there is phlegm in his throat, he is advised to cough and spit it out. If the patient is greatly affected by the symptoms, it will be good if his spittle is thick and if he can spit it out. When the patient is less affected by the wicked ch'i, he does not have much phlegm to eject, but if he is deeply affected, he tends to vomit and to expectorate heavily until everything is cleared up, and then his illness is cured. When the wicked element is rooted out, it {{does not need to be}} fumigated any more [...]|$|E
2500|$|Musically, Dance in the Rain {{consists}} of pop, dance, R and reggae styles. The album opens {{with the title}} track [...] "Dance in the Rain", which was described by Subculture Media as [...] "dramatic and self-affirming". The second single and second song [...] "Happy Ever After" [...] is based on Coulter's relationship with her fiancé Rich Harrison. Lyrically, she sings [...] "about new beginnings and starting a life together" [...] with her lover. The album's first single and third track [...] "All We Need Is Love" [...] is a pop and dance song about encouraging people to support one another and spread love. The fourth track [...] "In the Mood" [...] was described by Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun as [...] "anthemic and athletic". The third single and fifth track [...] "Giddyup" [...] is an R and pop song, with synth stabs, claps, and electro beats. The song's lyrics revolve around sex, with Coulter instructing listeners to [...] "saddle up and turn the lights out" [...] before they [...] "start the show" [...] with their lovers. She further directs listeners to [...] "Get on top and ride it / Cos you know that's how <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> <b>it</b> / Rock {{back and forth and}} grind it". Adams noted that [...] "Giddyup" [...] sees Coulter channeling [...] "her inner Beyoncé", while Subculture Media noted that it features [...] "some assertive and intoxicating sass throughout". Nic Kelly of Project U compared the song's production to Coulter's 2007 single [...] "Can't Touch It", while Adams called it [...] "the new 'Can't Touch It'".|$|E
2500|$|... "…Man has an {{unprecedented}} {{control over the}} world and everything in it. And so, whether <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> <b>it</b> or not, what happens next is very largely up to him." [...] He notes that when he spoke those words he could have had no idea that man might have unleashed forces that are now altering the Earth's climate. The naturalist highlights several meteorological and climatological catastrophes: Hurricane Katrina, the collapse of glaciers in Greenland, drought in the Amazon River, forest fires in Australia, and one of Europe's hottest summers (that caused 27,000 deaths). He wonders if, somehow, there is a connection between these events. Scientists {{all over the world are}} linking the changes in the Earth's weather to a global rise in temperatures. The actual figure is just 0.6°C since 1900, but this is only an average. For example, the Arctic has warmed by up to 3°C, and this threatens its whole ecosystem. A team has been surveying polar bears in the region for the last 25 years, and over that time, the animals have declined in number by a quarter. Each year the Arctic ice is also now melting three weeks earlier. The overall rate of glacier melt is accelerating: in southern Greenland, the amount of ice flowing into the sea has doubled in a decade, resulting in a rise of sea levels. This is exacerbated by the increase in temperatures, which causes oceans to expand. When Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, the sea temperatures of the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean were the highest ever recorded. In addition, the 2005 hurricane season was the worst ever. Scientists who have studied such severe weather warn that from now on hurricanes in the area will be more intense, more destructive and possibly more frequent. Also in 2005, the Amazon region suffered its worse drought in 60 years, decimating local fish populations. Six months later, trees have still not recovered. The abnormally warm seas in the Atlantic had disrupted the rainfall in the forest and for similar reasons, coral reefs are also at risk, leading to the phenomenon of coral bleaching.|$|E
