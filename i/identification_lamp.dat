25|$|In the US, {{vehicles}} over 2,032mm (80inches) wide must {{be equipped}} with three amber front and three red rear identification lamps spaced between 6 and 12inches apart {{at the center of}} the front and rear of the vehicle, as high as practicable. The front identification lamps are typically mounted atop the cab of vehicles. The purpose of these lamps is to alert other drivers to the presence of a wide (and usually, tall) vehicle. This type of <b>identification</b> <b>lamp</b> can also be found on road trains in Australia.|$|E
40|$|Only until recently, it {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that absolute localization with centimeter accuracy can be achieved for manually matched Persistent Scatterer (PS) s from TerraSAR-X images acquired from cross-heading geometries [1]. This paper describes an automatic algorithm for absolute localization of natural PSs in SAR images, where the detection of potential PSs is aided by high resolution optical data. As {{the focus of the}} study is on urban areas, the target detection part relies on <b>identification</b> of <b>lamp</b> posts using template matching. These targets are, most probably, the only ones visible in SAR images acquired from both ascending and descending orbits. Thus, the methodology includes <b>identification</b> of <b>lamp</b> posts from high resolution optical data and retrieves the precise absolute three-dimensional coordinates of the points from corrected TerraSAR-X timing measurements using the stereo SAR method [1]. Preliminary results for a test site in the city of Berlin acquired from TerraSAR-X high resolution spotlight mode are shown...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionDanon {{disease is}} an {{extremely}} rare X-linked dominant disorder characterized by progressive cardiomyopathy, muscle weakness, and mild mental retardation. Most cases harbor nonsense, frameshift, or splice-site mutations in LAMP 2 that result in lysosome-associated membrane protein- 2 (LAMP- 2) deficiency and lysosomal defects. The <b>identification</b> of <b>LAMP</b> 2 mutations {{makes it possible to}} detect female carriers with significant cardiomyopathy. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to develop useful carrier detection methods. MethodsTo screen for diminished LAMP- 2 expression among female patients with progressive cardiomyopathy, we developed a flow cytometric method to detect LAMP- 2 -deficient leukocytes. ResultsIn healthy controls, all circulating leukocyte populations, including granulocytes, monocytes, and lymphocytes, expressed significant levels of LAMP- 2. In contrast, cells from a male patient with Danon disease lacked detectable LAMP- 2. His younger twin sisters showed reduced levels of LAMP- 2 expression with characteristic bimodal fluorescence intensity patterns. The percentage of LAMP- 2 -negative cells in the asymptomatic sibling was nearly the same as that in the symptomatic sibling. ConclusionWe developed a flow cytometric assay for LAMP- 2 expression that can serve as a rapid primary screening method to detect carriers of LAMP- 2 deficiencies. This assay will narrow the target population before subjecting patients to more laborious and expensive gene mutation analysis...|$|R
40|$|Long wave {{ultraviolet}} radiation (UVA) {{has been shown}} {{to play an important role}} in the overall response of skin to solar radiation, including sunburn, tanning, premature aging, and non-melanoma skin cancer. UVA induction of inflammation in human skin is thought to be mediated by membrane lipid derived products. In order to investigate the mechanism of this response we examined the effect of UVA on phospho-lipid metabolism of human epidermal keratinocytes in culture. Keratinocytes were grown in serum free low calcium medium. The cells were prelabeled with [3 H] arachidonic acid or [3 H] choline and irradiated with UVA (Honle 2002 -Hg vapor <b>lamp).</b> <b>Identification</b> and quantitation of specific membrane phospholipid-derived components was achieved using high-performance liquid chromatography, paper chromatography, and radioimmunoassay. UVA resulted in a linear dose dependent release of [3 H] arachidonic acid into medium between 1 and 20 joule/cm 2. This response was inhibited in an oxygen-reduced environment. The radiolabel released was predominately free arachidonate and cyclooxygenase metabolites. Cyclooxygenase metabolites prostaglandin E 2 and prostacyclin derivative, 6 - keto-prostaglandin F 12, were stimulated following UVA irradiation, but the lipoxygenase metabolite, leukotriene B 4 was not detected. Maximal release was measured immediately after irradiation and changed little over 24 h post-irradiation. UVA stimulated an increase of [3 H] choline metabolites glycerophosphoryicholine and phosphorylcholine in media extracts suggesting UVA activation of phospholipase C and phospholipase A 2 or diacylglyceride lipase...|$|R
