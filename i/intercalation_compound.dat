40|$|It {{is known}} that it is {{possible}} to obtain <b>compounds</b> of graphite <b>intercalation</b> by oxidative treatment of graphite, getting termografenit from them. All known methods are associated with the graphite extraction from Fe-C containing wastes and its further oxidation. <b>Intercalation</b> <b>compounds</b> of graphite are formed as a result of the introduction of atomic and molecular layers of different chemical particles between the layers of graphite plates. Termografenit is very light dispersed graphite, having a unique complex of thermal and electrical properties. This is of interest to further study the technology of making this material. In previous studies, graphite was obtained from dispersed Fe-C containing wastes of metallurgy, and then was subjected to processing. However, considering the special microstructure and the morphology of the dispersed Fe-C containing wastes, they can become a raw material for production the <b>intercalation</b> <b>compounds</b> of graphite first, and then magnetic termografenit. In the present work dispersed Fe-C containing wastes of desulphurization at PJSC «Azovstal» with up to C 60 % were used.
