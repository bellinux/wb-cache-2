"When {{they want}} to do a thing, in {{business}} of course, they must wait till there arises in their brains, somehow, a religious, or ethical, or scientific, or philosophic, concept that the thing is right. And then they <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> unwitting that one of the weaknesses of the human mind is that the wish is parent to the thought. No matter what {{they want to}} do, the sanction always comes. They are superficial casuists. They are Jesuitical. They even see their way to doing wrong that right may come of it. One of the pleasant and axiomatic fictions they have created is that they are superior to the rest of mankind in wisdom and efficiency. Therefrom comes their sanction to manage the bread and butter of the rest of mankind. They have even resurrected the theory of the divine right of kings--commercial kings in their case.* ...|$|E

He was promoted despite opposition from executive staff, who considered Boots and Phillips {{to be an}} odd team. Frank Phillips was resistant to incorporating Adams' ideas. Phillips instructed Adams: [...] "I'm going to object to everything you do, but you <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> anyway." ...|$|E

He is equally afraid of the Malayan and Chinese prostitutes in the nearby city.

5000|$|In 1961, Corman {{announced}} he would make Masque from a script by Charles Beaumont to be produced for his Filmgroup Company. However, he later said was reluctant to make it because it had several elements similar to The Seventh Seal (1957), and Corman was worried people would say he was stealing from Bergman. [...] "I kept moving The Masque of the Red Death back, because of the similarities, {{but it was really}} an artificial reason in my mind," [...] he later said. Eventually he decided to <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> anyway.|$|E

5000|$|The group flew to Geneva, Switzerland {{in order}} to feature Collins in the video. According to band members, [...] "Collins was like, if y'all wanna do it, it's cool, y'all <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> but if y'all wanna do a video, y'all gotta come here...to Switzerland" [...] to shoot the video.The video carries a serious and {{reflective}} tone, with the Bone Thugs and Collins walking separately around the city, interpolating between quick flash scenes of the city streets, scenes of a drumming parade, and the members rapping (singing in Collins' case) either inside a train station or at one of several spots outside (mostly accompanied {{by at least one}} other member). Emphasizing the difference between Collins and the rappers, his motions are noticeably calmer and less vivid than Bone's.|$|E
5000|$|Sklansky {{attended}} the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania {{for a year}} before leaving to become a professional gambler. He briefly took on {{a job as an}} actuary before embarking into poker. While on the job, he discovered a faster way to do some of the calculations and took that discovery to his boss. The boss told him he could <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> that way if he wanted but wouldn’t pass on the information to the other workers. [...] "In other words, I knew something no one else knew, but I got no recognition for it," [...] Sklansky is quoted as saying in Al Alvarez's 1983 work The Biggest Game in Town. [...] "In poker, if you're better than anyone else, you make immediate money. If there's something I know about the game that the other person doesn't, and if he's not willing to learn or can't understand, then I take his money." ...|$|E

In the Second Symphony you don't have to alter so much, but funnily enough there is a lot that needs altering in the Seventh Symphony ... My attitude was [...] "" [...] which in German means roughly 'be true to the work'. But you see, the composers didn't always know; they could have given it more thought. Bruckner, when things were suggested to him by Lowe and Schalk (who were certainly not stupid) told them to <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> Maybe he was weak and should have argued sometimes a little bit more, {{but on the other hand}} many of their suggestions are fine." [...] And his passionate approach to the score brought him admiration from fellow Finns, Jukka-Pekka Saraste and Osmo Vänskä, as well as from one of the finest Sibelians, Sir Simon Rattle.|$|E

50|$|The jaded {{daughter}} of the Count, Miss Julie, orders her fiancé Niels to kiss her boot, whereupon he breaks off their engagement in disgust. Later that evening John, the valet, and his fiancée Christine, the cook, sit with Miss Julie. Miss Julie flirts with John, who eventually admits he has loved her since boyhood. On the following day John and Miss Julie discuss how they will spend their lives together, and John expresses his desire to go to Lake Como to make his living running a hotel. When Miss Julie admits she has no money of her own to finance such an undertaking, John demands she somehow find some, so Miss Julie steals money from the Count. Meanwhile, Christine discovers John's intentions and threatens to quit her job with the Count. The lovers prepare to escape, but Miss Julie demands to take her canary with her. Angered, John kills the bird. She grabs his razor and threatens to slit her wrists, and he suggests she <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> The Count rings for John, and he leaves, as Julie goes slowly into the garden and follows his suggestion.|$|E
5000|$|I feel Aleister Crowley is a {{misunderstood}} {{genius of}} the 20th century. It is because his whole thing was liberation of the person, of the entity and that restrictions would foul you up, lead to frustration which leads to violence, crime, mental breakdown, depending on what sort of makeup you have underneath. The further this age we're in now gets into technology and alienation, {{a lot of the}} points he's made seem to manifest themselves all down the line. ...I'm not saying it's a system for anybody to follow. I don't agree with everything but I find a lot of it relevant and it's those things that people attacked him on, so he was misunderstood....I'm not trying to interest anyone in Aleister Crowley any more than I am in Charles Dickens. All it was, was that at a particular time he was expounding a theory of self-liberation, which is something which is so important. He was like an eye to the world, into the forthcoming situation. My studies have been quite intensive, but I don't particularly want to go into it because it's a personal thing and isn't in relation to anything apart from the fact that I've employed his system in my own day to day life....The thing is {{to come to terms with}} one's free will, discover one's place and what one is, and from that you can <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> and not spend your whole life suppressed and frustrated. It's very basically coming to terms with yourself.|$|E
5000|$|Klavierstück XI {{is famous}} for its mobile, or {{polyvalent}} structure. The mobile structure and graphic layout of the piece resembles that of Morton Feldman's Intermission 6 for 1 or 2 pianos of 1953, in which 15 fragments are distributed on a single page of music with the instruction: [...] "Composition begins with any sound and proceeds to the any other" [...] In the same year, Earle Brown had composed Twenty-five Pages for 1-25 pianists, in which the pages are to be arranged in a sequence chosen by the performer(s), and each page may be performed either side up and events within each two-line system may be read as either treble or bass clef ( [...] ; [...] ). When David Tudor, who at the time was preparing a version of Feldman's piece, was in Cologne in 1955, Stockhausen asked him, [...] "What if I wrote a piece where you could decide where you wanted to go on the page?" [...] I said I knew someone who was already doing one, and he said, [...] "In that case I shall not compose it". So I retracted, and said it was just an idea my friend was thinking about, and told him he mustn’t consider any other composer but should <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> anyway, and that led to Klavierstück No 11. Apart from the layout on the page, Feldman's piece has nothing in common with Stockhausen's composition. Rather than rhythmic cells, its components are single tones and chords, with no rhythmic or dynamic indications [...]|$|E

50|$|After {{footage of}} the attack was aired on Yemeni television, showing {{an attack on a}} {{hospital}} within the ministry compound and the killing of medical personal and patients, the head of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula released a video message apologizing.

5000|$|We had {{a meeting}} in New York when we started the tour over here. We met in New York to get {{together}} and see it as a launch-off place. Kind of had a talk about {{what we were going to}} do. At that meeting Kerry and Derek said this was going to be the last tour and they didn't want to be on the road anymore. And you understand it; they had families. Kerry had just had a baby and Derek was just getting married. But having said that, I was married and so was John. You can change things like that; there are ways to work around that. You don't have to tour. I don't think we really toured an awful lot as Giant. I think we could have worked a lot harder at touring. We toured perhaps five or six months of the year. The rest of the year we didn't tour, which seemed a bit silly if you really want to make it or break the market. So let's <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> and capitalize on this rush we got. So it all seemed a little odd to me. It was sad. Gary Green reflects on the final Gentle Giant split In the summer of 1980, the group quietly disbanded. In 2005, Derek Shulman recalled that [...] "the creative juices just weren't flowing. I was living in Los Angeles at the time when we broke up. We weren't really sure what direction to take. I don't regret the decision we made to disband, and I'd do it again if we were to do the whole thing all over again." [...] Ray Shulman has commented: [...] "There was definitely the decision that the last tour would be the last tour. Once we knew that, we enjoyed ourselves. We decided to quit then rather than let it go on too long." [...] In an interview with Mojo in 2000, Kerry Minnear asserted [...] "(the split) wasn't because of punk, it was because we had lost our way musically." ...|$|E
40|$|From the Introduction. Who {{really wants}} to do it? Since the Brexit {{referendum}} in the UK and {{the publication of the}} EU Global Strategy (EUGS) in June 2016, there has been a flurry of proposals by Member States to deepen defence cooperation {{in the context of the}} EU. Most notable among these were two Franco-German papers, first by the two foreign and then by the two defence ministers, and a proposal by the French, German, Italian and Spanish defence ministers. Most notable, because without both France and Germany involved, no initiative can reach the scale to make it worthwhile.

40|$|Nowadays the {{business}} world {{is no longer the}} exclusive province of men as more and more women are taking up the option of self-employment and setting up businesses themselves. Have you every thought about starting up in business? If you have, then this book is for you. This is an exciting time for women now that the changing nature of work is beginning to open up new opportunities and challenges. In particular, it is emerging that business really does matter for women. Business is becoming a real career option for women and an important means of self-advancement, fulfilment and economic independence. Increasingly, business is being seen as a possibl solution to problems arising from unemployment, redundancy, emigration or attempts to return to work after raising a family. Many women too see business as a more attractive alternative than attempting to overcome barriers to advancement in traditional organisations. In the USE, for example, women are going into business for themselves at twice the rate of men. In Ireland too, despite the unemployment statistics, and the gloomy headlines on recession, there are many opportunities for new businesses. Many women are exploiting this potential with women-owned businesses being the fastest growing sector, particularly in the service area. The entrepreneurial spirit is not new for women. Down through the years women have been involved in small-scale enterprises. Women have often been the silent partners with their spouses in running a small business or farm enterprise. Nowadays, however, women are taking a more public and prominent role in the world of business. These women entrepreneurs are not superwomen different from the ordinary community of women. They are women like yourself and you too can join them. The advice from successful Irish business women is {{that if you have a}} good idea for a business you should just <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> It is important to have a positive approach and a positive self-image and to believe in your ability to be successful. Most importantly, these women emphasise that {{the business}} idea is vital, that you must know what you are setting out to do, be well-prepared, have done your homework and, above all else, you must plan. The key to success is realism and 'intelligent planned anticipation'...|$|E
