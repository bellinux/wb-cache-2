5|$|Along {{with the}} most modern units of the High Seas Fleet, Brummer and Bremse were {{included}} in the ships specified for internment at Scapa Flow by the victorious Allied powers. The ships steamed out of Germany on 21 November 1918 <b>in</b> <b>single</b> <b>file,</b> commanded by Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter. They were met at sea by a combined fleet of 370 British, American, and French warships. The fleet arrived in the Firth of Forth later that day, and between 25 and 27 November, they were escorted to Scapa Flow. Upon arrival, all wireless equipment was removed from the ships and the breech blocks of their heavy guns taken to prevent their use. Crews were reduced to minimum levels.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand Brigade {{commander}} {{had been}} taken ill, so Birdwood appointed Brigadier-General Harold Walker, a staff officer already ashore, as commander. The Auckland Battalion had landed by 12:00, and were being sent north along the beach to Walker's Ridge {{on their way to}} Russell's Top. Seeing that the only way along the ridge was <b>in</b> <b>single</b> <b>file</b> along a goat track, Walker ordered them to take the route over Plugge's Plateau. As each New Zealand unit landed they were directed the same way to Baby 700. However, in trying to avoid Turkish fire, they became split up in Monash Valley and Rest Gully, and it was after midday that two of the Auckland companies reached Baby 700.|$|E
5|$|While {{stopped on}} the Biggerstaff land, the rebels convicted 36 Loyalist prisoners. Some were testified against by Patriots who had {{previously}} fought alongside them and later changed sides. Nine of the prisoners were hanged before Isaac Shelby brought {{an end to the}} proceedings. His decision to halt the executions came after an impassioned plea for mercy from one of the Biggerstaff women, although accounts vary as to whether it was Martha Biggerstaff, Aaron's wife, or Mary Van Zant Biggerstaff, Benjamin's wife. Many of the Patriots dispersed over the next few days, while all but 130 of the Loyalist prisoners escaped while being led <b>in</b> <b>single</b> <b>file</b> through woodlands. The column finally made camp at Salem, North Carolina.|$|E

The ships steamed out of Germany on 21 November 1918 <b>in</b> <b>single</b> <b>file,</b> commanded by Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter. Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, and so he ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to scuttle his ships. Brummer sank at 13:05; she was never raised for scrapping and remains on the bottom of Scapa Flow. Bremse sank at 14:30 and was ultimately raised on 27 November 1929 and broken up for scrap in 1932–1933 in Lyness.|$|E
5|$|Armed {{with the}} {{knowledge}} gained from their prisoners, Alvarado sent 40 men to cover the exit from the cave and launched another assault along the ravine from the west, <b>in</b> <b>single</b> <b>file</b> owing to its narrowness, with crossbowmen alternating with soldiers bearing muskets, each with a companion sheltering him from arrows and stones with a shield. This tactic allowed the Spanish {{to break through the}} pass and storm the entrance of the city. The Poqomam warriors fell back in disorder in a chaotic retreat through the city, and were hunted down by the victorious conquistadors and their allies. Those who managed to retreat down the neighbouring valley were ambushed by Spanish cavalry who had been posted to block the exit from the cave, the survivors were captured and brought back to the city. The siege had lasted more than a month and because of the defensive strength of the city, Alvarado ordered it to be burned and moved the inhabitants to the new colonial village of Mixco.|$|E
5|$|Brumfield {{arrived by}} {{helicopter}} {{on the morning}} of 8 November, just as A Company was preparing to depart from its night location at 08:00. With contact now seeming unlikely to the Australians, Healy was instructed to move to a rendezvous from which the battalion would be extracted back to Bien Hoa the following day. A Company subsequently set out on a compass bearing which would take them across the northern edge of the Gang Toi plateau. By 10:30 the Australians moved out <b>in</b> <b>single</b> <b>file</b> but had not gone far before a lone Viet Cong scout was observed shadowing them; he was subsequently shot and killed by the rear section. Crossing a creek line the Australians uncovered a company-sized camp of dugouts and trenches, before being fired upon at 15:40 by a single Viet Cong soldier who then fled. A Company halted briefly, and at this time two Viet Cong approached their position, before being killed by 1 Platoon.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the tombs}} are {{not open to}} the public (18 of the tombs can be opened, but they are rarely open at the same time), and {{officials}} occasionally close those that are open for restoration work. The number of visitors to KV62 has led to a separate charge for entry into the tomb. The West Valley has only one open tomb—that of Ay—and a separate ticket is needed to visit this tomb. The tour guides are no longer allowed to lecture inside the tombs, and visitors are expected to proceed quietly and <b>in</b> <b>single</b> <b>file</b> through the tombs. This is to minimize time in the tombs and prevent the crowds from damaging the surfaces of the decoration. Photography is no longer allowed in the tombs.|$|E

To the left of the picture, parked next to the zebra crossing, is a white Volkswagen Beetle which belonged to one of the people living in the block of flats across from the recording studio. After the album was released, the number plate (LMW 281F) was stolen repeatedly from the car. In 1986, the car was sold at auction for £2,530 and in 2001 was on display in a museum in Germany. The man standing on the pavement to the right of the picture is Paul Cole (7 July 1911– 13 February 2008), an American tourist unaware he had been photographed until he saw the album cover months later. On the original cover, McCartney holds a cigarette; in 2003 several US poster companies airbrushed this cigarette out of the image, without permission from either Apple or McCartney.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{a fourth}} CH-21 {{returned}} to Ap Bac {{to attempt to}} rescue the downed helicopter crews, and it too was heavily damaged by ground fire and forced {{to land on the}} muddy rice field. The Viet Cong had set a new record: the battle was the first time they had either destroyed or downed five helicopters within a few hours. At 13:30, Ba's M113 formation finally closed in on the downed helicopters {{on the west side of}} Ap Bac. The M113s approached the landing zone <b>in</b> <b>single</b> <b>file</b> instead of in formation, and they were immediately fired upon by Viet Cong inside the hamlet who were able to concentrate their fire on one target at a time. The South Vietnamese M113 gun crews were exposed from the waist up, so they were easy targets for snipers; by the end of the day, 14 South Vietnamese M113 crewmen had been killed due to their exposure. The two leading M113s were able to pull up beside the downed helicopters, but one driver was killed while driving with his head outside of the hatch, and Ba was knocked unconscious inside his carrier.|$|E
5|$|The Australians {{continued}} <b>in</b> <b>single</b> <b>file</b> {{towards the}} top of the plateau, with 1 Platoon—under Sergeant Gordon Peterson—leading, followed by 2 and then 3 Platoon. The going was slow in the dense jungle and visibility was limited. By 16:30 the lead section was nearing {{the top of}} the hill having gone just , while the last platoon—3 Platoon—was still leaving the harbour. Suddenly, 1 Platoon was hit by heavy small arms fire from at least three Viet Cong machine-guns in well-sited bunkers, supported by rifles and grenades. The fire engulfed the lead section and platoon headquarters, causing five casualties in the opening minute. Pinned down, the Australians went to ground and began returning fire, allowing all except one of the wounded to crawl to safety. Private Richard Parker, who had fallen directly in front of the bunker system, was unable to be recovered. Failing to respond to the shouts of his comrades, Parker was exposed to further hits, although was probably already dead. To support the beleaguered platoon, Healy subsequently ordered the support section from company headquarters to move forward to provide covering fire, while 3 Platoon moved up on the left flank. However, due to the dispersed patrolling plan adopted, the remaining companies were unable to provide any assistance.|$|E
5|$|The {{book had}} {{chapters}} on memory, imitation and suggestion, perceptual illusions, and esthetics. In these he refuted {{the idea that}} experience was just the external environment acting on and molding a mind working as a passive recipient. Stratton saw the sensation of time as being multidimensional, in analogy with perception of space. That we could simultaneously hear separately, without synthesizing, multiple mixed tones meant our experiences did not necessarily come <b>in</b> <b>single</b> <b>file</b> temporally. To Stratton this meant time had multiple dimensions, since simultaneous events could not be distinguished on the one past-present-future dimension of time alone. He did not address how the other dimensions could be in temporal-space if the events were indistinguishable temporally to begin with. He also analyzed poetic measure as mathematically connected to the waxing and waning span of attention, tying the arts to psychology. This last was rebutted by Charles Samuel Myers, writing in Nature, who saw poetry and its rhythm as too complex a subject to be reduced to the arithmetic of attention spans.|$|E

5|$|In 1525 Pedro de Alvarado sent a {{small company}} to conquer Mixco Viejo (Chinautla Viejo), {{the capital of the}} Poqomam. The Spanish {{attempted}} an approach through a narrow pass but were forced back with heavy losses. Alvarado himself launched the second assault with 200 Tlaxcalan allies but was also beaten back. The Poqomam then received reinforcements, and the two armies clashed on open ground outside of the city. The battle was chaotic and lasted for most of the day, but was finally decided by the Spanish cavalry. The leaders of the reinforcements surrendered to the Spanish three days after their retreat and revealed that the city had a secret entrance {{in the form of a}} cave.

5|$|The {{race was}} {{restarted}} on lap 14, with Ambrose leading Denny Hamlin (both of whom {{opted not to}} pit) Almirola, Stewart and Jamie McMurray. Hamlin passed Ambrose {{to take the lead}} one lap later. Stewart, with aid from Burton, took over the lead from Hamlin one lap later. Hamlin reclaimed the lead on lap 17 and McDowell moved into second place. Hamlin continued to maintain his lead over the next four laps while McMurray battled with Stewart for second. McDowell had fallen to eighth by lap 21, while Stewart continued in second by lap 25. On the 28th lap, McMurray tried an overtake around the outside of Hamlin for the lead at turn three but could not complete the maneuver, causing him to drop to eighth two laps later. On lap 32, the top five were Hamlin, Stewart, Harvick, Stenhouse and Ambrose. As the cars ran <b>in</b> <b>single</b> <b>file,</b> Edwards had dropped to 15th place one lap later. McDowell was told by his team to save fuel on lap 43. Green flag pit stops began on lap 44 when Hamlin and Ambrose stopped for tyres and fuel, allowing Stewart to assume the lead with Kevin Harvick in second and Stenhouse in third. Eight laps later, after making a pit stop, Michael Waltrip lost control of his car on the backstraightaway after driving {{from the side of the}} track onto the race track, and crashed into the backstretch wall. The incident caused the second caution to be shown as every driver except Stewart, Harvick and Edwards stopped for fuel.|$|E
