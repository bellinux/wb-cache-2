50|$|A <b>{{dedicated}}</b> <b>circuit,</b> private circuit, or {{leased line}} is a line that is dedicated to only one use. Originally, this was analog, and was often used by radio stations as a studio/transmitter link (STL) or remote pickup unit (RPU) for their audio, sometimes as a backup to other means. Later lines were digital, and used for private corporate data networks.|$|E

40|$|E-science {{projects}} involving geographically distributed data sources, {{computing resources}} and sci-entists, have special networking requirements {{such as a}} steady throughput and deterministic behav-ior. The connectionless Internet model is not well-suited to meet such requirements. Connection-oriented networks that offer guaranteed-rate, <b>dedicated</b> <b>circuits</b> have been proposed to meet the high-end networking needs of distributed scientific research. In this work we describe the design and implementation of a transport protocol for such <b>dedicated</b> <b>circuits.</b> We present an initial user-space, UDP-based implementation called Fixed Rate Transport Proto-col (FRTP). The constraints imposed by a user-space implementation led us to implement a lower-overhead kernel-space solution that we call Circuit-TCP (C-TCP). The key feature of C-TCP is to maintain a fixed sending rate, closely matched to the circuit rate, {{with the aim of}} achieving high circuit utilization. We implemented C-TCP by modifying the Linux TCP/IP stack. Experimental results on a wide-area circuit-switched testbed show that C-TCP is able to quickly utilize circuit bandwidth and sustain a high data transfer rate. ii...|$|R
50|$|The Service Evaluation System (SES) was an {{operations}} support system developed by Bell Laboratories and used by telephone companies {{beginning in the late}} 1960s. Many local, long distance, and operator circuit-switching systems provided special <b>dedicated</b> <b>circuits</b> to the SES to monitor the quality of customer connections during the call setup process. Calls were selected at random by switching systems and one-way voice connections were established to the SES monitoring center.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to GPRS, {{there are two}} other GSM technologies which deliver data services: circuit-switched data (CSD) and high-speed circuit-switched data (HSCSD). In contrast to the shared nature of GPRS, these instead establish a <b>dedicated</b> <b>circuit</b> (usually billed per minute). Some applications such as video calling may prefer HSCSD, especially when there is a continuous flow of data between the endpoints.|$|E
