5000|$|Chinatown, San Francisco {{is an area}} {{in which}} many {{immigrants}} and small business owners reside and have been subject to mass gentrification. Due to the <b>free</b> <b>landscape</b> and convenient location of Chinatown, large businesses are attracted to the area and many small businesses in the area have been unable to make ends meet as a result. There have been multiple attempts through policy initiatives to try to preserve cultural value in Chinatown and slow down gentrification. The Chinatown Resource Center made an attempt to prevent developers who want to purchase land in Chinatown to create offices; however, 1,700 previously occupied residential units were still converted into office space. As a response, the Chinatown Resource Center created a proposal to make structural changes in land use policy to decrease or slow [...] "revitalization." [...] Furthermore, Chinatown Core's Planning department created the 1986 Rezoning Plan, which prohibited demolition and converting residential buildings in Chinatown Core for alternative needs. However, all other parts of Chinatown, such as the Chinatown North and Polk Gulch were not protected by this plan (only Chinatown Core was). Thus, many Asian communities in non-Chinatown Core areas suffered from threats of buyouts and eviction. For example, the amount of Asian residents in Chinatown's Polk Gulch neighborhood decreased from 3,519 to 2,527 from 1980 to 2013. In addition, majority of these Asian residents were replaced by white residents. Though policy iniatives have slowed down gentrification in Chinatown, it has not prevented it.|$|E

40|$|A {{proof that}} almost all quantum systems have trap free (that is, free from local optima) landscapes is {{presented}} for a large and physically general class of quantum system. This result offers an explanation for why gradient methods succeed so frequently in quantum control in both theory and practice. The role of singular controls is analyzed using geometric tools {{in the case of}} the control of the propagator of closed finite dimension systems. This type of control field has been implicated as a source of landscape traps. The conditions under which singular controls can introduce traps, and thus interrupt the progress of a control optimization, are discussed and a geometrical characterization of the issue is presented. It is shown that a control being singular is not sufficient to cause a control optimization progress to halt and sufficient conditions for a trap <b>free</b> <b>landscape</b> are presented. It is further shown that the local surjectivity axiom of landscape analysis can be refined to the condition that the end-point map is transverse to each of the level sets of the fidelity function. This novel condition is shown to be sufficient for a quantum system's landscape to be trap free. The control landscape for a quantum system is shown to be trap free for all but a null set of Hamiltonians using a novel geometric technique based on the parametric transversality theorem. Numerical evidence confirming this is also presented. This result is the analogue of the work of Altifini, wherein it is shown that controllability holds for all but a null set of quantum systems in the dipole approximation. The presented results indicate that by-and-large limited control resources are the most physically relevant source of landscape traps...|$|E

For this study, 18 soils were collected across 3 parallel transects using a spatially explicit sampling design. Soil genomic DNA was extracted and 454 pyrotag sequencing along with qPCR was performed targeting the bacterial 16 S rRNA and fungal ITS/ 18 S rRNA genes. Both the microbial and environmental data were analysed using Primer 6 and Permanova software and the community diversity and their similarity was investigated. Our results showed the bacterial community to consist predominantly of Actinobacteria (up to 55 %), Chloroflexi (&# 8805; 10 %), Acidobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria and Gemmatimonadetes. While Ascomycota (&# 8805; 96 %), Basidiomycota (> 1. 5 %) and Fungi incertae sedis (< 1 %) were the dominant fungi. A significant relationship between microbial community structures and environmental properties (extrinsic and intrinsic) was observed. For bacterial communities elevation, sand, conductivity, Cl-, SO 4 [...] and total nitrogen were driving community pattern, while mud, total nitrogen, total carbon, SiO 2 and sodium oxide were affecting fungal community distributions. Bacterial communities from samples of same polygon were more similar than the communities from different polygons and distance. While Fungal community distributions were random (soil sample specific) ie no trend was observed over the landscape or individual polygons. In this study, a culture clash was observed between the culture dependent and independent approaches to microbial characterisation.

40|$|In {{response}} to drought and regional {{growth in the}} arid western United States, urban water demand management is increasingly important. Single family residences are the largest category of users with 60 % of their water consumption applied to landscapes often in excess of plant water requirements. Our research investigates water conservation behavior in relation to residential landscape irrigation {{and the effectiveness of}} a water check program as a conservation tool. In Utah’s sixth year of drought (2004), we conducted research in connection with <b>free</b> <b>landscape</b> irrigation system evaluations (water checks) offered to all households in Logan, Utah. During the summer of 2005, we selected a targeted sample of above-average Logan water users but otherwise replicated the intervention (water checks, research). The landscape water checks included detailed evaluations of households’ sprinkler systems and landscapes, and provided the occupants with site-specific seasonally-adjusted watering schedules and conservation recommendations, which the occupants were encouraged to adopt. Pre-intervention (at time of water check) and post-intervention (end of growing season) open-ended interviews were conducted with all households. Utilizing an interdisciplinary technique developed by Kjelgren, Neale and Endter-Wada, the appropriateness of landscape water use in relation to plant needs is determined and then used as the dependent variable in analyses of water use patterns before and subsequent to the water check interventions. Research results are being interpreted in light of the social-ecological and proenvironmental competency frameworks emerging within the field of environmental psychology. These frameworks help to explain why many people who generally see water conservation as being socially desirable are unable to translate their attitudes into conservation behavior. The maintenance of residential landscapes is a complex activity that is socially embedded and not simply a task. Landscapes are maintained to meet neighborhood expectations, as a means of self-expression, or to enhance a property’s value. Individuals are part of their environment and their use of objects, such as a sprinkler system, mediate behavior affecting the environment and social experiences. A sprinkler system’s instrumental function is to water a landscape, but it can have the unintended environmental consequence of over-watering a landscape when improperly used. Landscape water checks provide the educational opportunity to address how people utilize and perceive their sprinkler systems and to build their landscape watering skills and knowledge.

In this context we show {{to what extent the}} dynamics can be represented as an evolution in the <b>free</b> energy <b>landscape.</b> In particular the relationship between the long-time dynamics and the local properties of the <b>free</b> energy <b>landscape</b> shows up explicitly within this approach. Conversely, by an instantaneous normal modes analysis we show that the local properties of the energy landscape seen by the system during its dynamical evolution do not change qualitatively at the dynamical transition.

40|$|A {{scheme for}} extracting an {{effective}} <b>free</b> energy <b>landscape</b> from single-molecule time series is presented. This procedure uniquely identifies a non-Gaussian {{distribution of the}} observable associated with each local equilibrium state (LES). Both the number of LESs and {{the shape of the}} non-Gaussian distributions depend on the time scale of observation. By assessing how often the system visits and resides in a chosen LES and escapes from one LES to another (with checking whether the local detailed balance is satisfied), our scheme naturally leads to an effective <b>free</b> energy <b>landscape</b> whose topography depends on in which time scale the system experiences the underlying landscape. For example, two metastable states are unified as one if the time scale of observation is longer than the escape time scale for which the system can visit mutually these two states. As an illustrative example, we present the application of extracting the effective <b>free</b> energy <b>landscapes</b> from time series of the end-to-end distance of a three-color, 46 -bead model protein. It indicates that the time scales to attain the local equilibrium tend to be longer in the unfolded state than those in the compact collapsed state...|$|R
