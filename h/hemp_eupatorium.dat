50|$|Umbelliferone is {{the parent}} {{compound}} {{for a large}} number of natural products. Herniarin (7-O-methylumbelliferone or 7-methoxycoumarin) occurs in the leaves of water <b>hemp</b> (<b>Eupatorium</b> ayapana) and rupturewort (Herniaria). O-Glycosylated derivatives such as skimmin (7-O-Î²-D-glucopyranosylumbelliferone) occur naturally and are used for the fluorimetric determination of glycoside hydrolase enzymes. Isoprenylated derivatives are also widespread, such as marmin (found in grapefruit skin and in the bark of the Bael tree) and furocoumarins such as marmesin, angelicin, and psoralen.|$|E

50|$|The larvae feed on {{the flowers}} and seeds of <b>hemp</b> agrimony (<b>Eupatorium</b> cannabinum), gypsywort (Lycopus europaeus), and of Chrysocoma linosyris during August to October. After this feeding period, the larva builds a cocoon near the food plant in which it overwinters.|$|R
50|$|Plants {{found here}} which are rare in Falkirk District include Alternate-leaved golden saxifrage (Chrysosplenium alternifolium), Moschatel (Adoxa moschatellina) and <b>Hemp</b> Agrimony (<b>Eupatorium</b> cannabinum). The site also {{contains}} Pendulous Sedge (Carex pendula) and Lily of the Valley (Convallaria majalis) {{both of which}} are uncommon in Scotland.|$|R
50|$|The {{butterfly}} is on wing from June to September {{depending on}} the location. They usually feed on nectar of scabious (Scabiosa species), <b>hemp</b> agrimony (<b>Eupatorium</b> cannabinum) and other tall flowers. The larvae feed on grass species, such as Molinia caerulea, Arrhenatherum elatius, Oryza sativa, Avena, Dactylis, Poa, Festuca, Carex, Calamagrostis and Bromus species.|$|R
50|$|Other {{areas of}} the fen become drier during periods of dry weather and support a {{different}} range of plant life. Taller vegetation is more common, particularly reed Phragmites australis and meadowsweet Filipendula ulmaria. Different plants are associated with this vegetation, increasing bodiversity to include species such as <b>hemp</b> agrimony <b>Eupatorium</b> cannabinum, purple loosestrife Lythrum salicaria and great hairy willowherb Epilobium hirsutum. Scrub and woodland vegetation has developed throughout the fens with sallow and alder predominant in these areas, although Blo' Norton Fen has some oak and ash woodland.|$|R
