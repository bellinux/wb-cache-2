40|$|In this paper, the {{continuous}} periodic <b>interferences</b> <b>in</b> partial discharge (PD) on line monitoring and their characteristics are analyzed. An IIR notch filter for eliminating continuous periodic <b>interferences</b> <b>in</b> PD on line monitoring is first proposed, {{and a more}} efficient method of eliminating continuous periodic interferences is then developed. The experiment results are also given, which show that the proposed method is effective for rejecting continuous periodic <b>interferences</b> <b>in</b> PD on line monitoring. For PD on line monitoring with higher sampling frequency, it is also demonstrated that the data compression can be real-time realized...|$|R

5|$|A classic {{site for}} the study of biocolonisation from founder populations that arrive from outside (allochthonous), Surtsey was {{declared}} a nature reserve in 1965, while the eruption was still in active progress. Today only a few scientists are permitted to land on Surtsey; the only way anyone else can see it closely is from a small plane. This allows the natural ecological succession for the island to proceed without outside <b>interference.</b> <b>In</b> 2008, UNESCO declared the island a World Heritage Site, in recognition of its great scientific value.|$|E
5|$|As {{with any}} war of such length, the {{drawn-out}} Byzantine–Arab Wars had long-lasting effects {{for both the}} Byzantine Empire and the Arab world. The Byzantines experienced extensive territorial loss, while the invading Arabs gained strong control in the Middle East and Africa. The focus of the Byzantine Empire shifted from the western reconquests of Justinian to a primarily defensive position, against the Islamic armies on its eastern borders. Without Byzantine <b>interference</b> <b>in</b> the emerging Christian states of western Europe, the situation gave a huge stimulus to feudalism and economic self-sufficiency.|$|E

Previously proposed countermeasures were either too costly for practical use or only effective against particular attacks.
