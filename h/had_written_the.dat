5|$|O'Neal <b>had</b> <b>written</b> <b>the</b> script as {{a murder}} mystery, set in California, that {{followed}} a woman hunted by a serial killer. Bodeen revised the script, basing {{the story on}} a Satanic society he had encountered in New York City. Filming took place over 24 days in May 1943 at RKO Studios in Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|On 13 September 1862 Constantine Simonides, {{skilled in}} {{calligraphy}} {{and with a}} controversial background with manuscripts, made the claim in print in The Guardian that he <b>had</b> <b>written</b> <b>the</b> codex himself {{as a young man}} in 1839 in the Panteleimonos monastery at Athos.|$|E
5|$|Bach had {{composed}} his Christmas Oratorio, {{based on}} the gospels of Luke and Matthew, in 1734, a work in six parts to be performed on six occasions during Christmas tide. He had composed an Easter Oratorio already in 1725. The Ascension Oratorio appeared thus in the same liturgical year as the Christmas Oratorio. The text for the Ascension Oratorio, a compilation of several biblical sources, free poetry and chorales, was presumably written by Picander who <b>had</b> <b>written</b> <b>the</b> libretti for the St Matthew Passion and the Christmas Oratorio, among others. It follows {{the story of the}} Ascension as told in Luke, Mark and the Acts of the Apostles.|$|E

5|$|By 1983, Kennedy Martin <b>had</b> <b>written</b> <b>the</b> {{first draft}} of what would {{eventually}} become Edge of Darkness – at this stage it was called Magnox (a reference to the Magnox type of nuclear reactor) and was about trade union problems in the nuclear industry. The script was given to BBC Head of Drama Series & Serials, Jonathan Powell, who encouraged Kennedy Martin to continue its development. The script would go though many changes and revisions before reaching its final form.|$|E
5|$|Exactly {{what part}} each {{played in the}} authorship is unknown. At the time, Grave {{asserted}} that he had authored the manifesto and that Kropotkin had revised it. Alternatively, Gregori Maximoff reported that Kropotkin <b>had</b> <b>written</b> <b>the</b> document and that Grave had merely advised minor alterations. George Woodcock noted that the work seems to be highly influenced by Kropotkin's common concerns and arguments against the German Empire, and so felt that the exact authorship was unimportant.|$|E
5|$|Gosse had {{collected}} the British Museum specimen of Oryzomys antillarum in 1845, {{but may not}} have separated it from introduced rats found with it. Coues noted that the two USNM specimens he examined were received after he <b>had</b> <b>written</b> <b>the</b> preceding part of his monograph; later, Thomas and others wrote that these specimens were obtained around 1877, but Ray asserted that they were taken before 1874. No specimens have been collected since.|$|E

5|$|In August 2014, film {{director}} Sathish Paul filed a copyright infringement {{suit against the}} makers, saying that it had similarities to his script titled Oru Mazhakkalathu, written in 2013. The court passed an order saying that the movie had prima facie similarities to Sathish' script, but allowed {{the making of the}} Tamil version Papanasam to proceed, on the condition that the makers of Drishyam produce a 10 lakh bank guarantee before the court to ensure the compensation. The case was dismissed in March 2015 as it was proved that Jeethu <b>had</b> <b>written</b> <b>the</b> script in 2011.|$|E
5|$|In February 2007, a {{controversy}} arose after Brown's appearance at King Philip Regional High School in Wrentham, Massachusetts {{as part of}} a debate on gay marriage. The high school students had launched a Facebook group attack on Brown and had made a derogatory remark about his daughter, Ayla. During his presentation, Brown defended himself and his daughter by directly quoting several vulgar statements they had made and announcing the names of the students who <b>had</b> <b>written</b> <b>the</b> statements. Critics questioned whether Brown should have quoted the profane comments in front of a high school audience.|$|E
5|$|In June 1935 Calleia was {{announced}} to star as Joaquin Murrieta in I Am Joaquin (later titled Robin Hood of El Dorado), a film {{for which he}} <b>had</b> <b>written</b> <b>the</b> screenplay. MGM replaced him with Warner Baxter, ostensibly because Calleia was too old, although Baxter was six years older. Calleia did receive a notable starring role in Man of the People (1937), a political drama about a young lawyer fighting corporate racketeers.|$|E

5|$|In March 2014, Sony {{announced}} that Druckmann {{was writing a}} film adaptation of The Last of Us, produced by Sam Raimi and distributed by Screen Gems. By January 2015, Druckmann <b>had</b> <b>written</b> <b>the</b> script's second draft, and performed a read-through with some actors. Very little work occurred following this, as Druckmann stated in April 2016 that the film had entered development hell. Druckmann is currently co-writing a sequel to the first game, titled The Last of Us Part II, alongside Halley Gross; Straley will not return to co-direct the game. In August 2017, Druckmann was featured as a guest judge on an episode of Face Off.|$|E
5|$|In early 1996, former FBI hostage {{negotiator}} {{and criminal}} profiler Clinton R. Van Zandt was contacted by an investigator working with Bisceglie. Bisceglie asked Van Zandt {{to compare the}} manifesto to typewritten copies of handwritten letters David had received from his brother. Van Zandt's initial analysis determined that there was better than a 60 percent chance that the same person <b>had</b> <b>written</b> <b>the</b> letters {{as well as the}} manifesto, which had been in public circulation for half a year. Van Zandt's second analytical team determined an even higher likelihood that the letters and the manifesto were the product of the same author. He recommended that Bisceglie's client immediately contact the FBI.|$|E
5|$|Initially, experts {{determined}} the manuscript was genuine, as the date Horse picked matched {{the time period}} Horne had been alive and active, and the manuscript's topics matched the poet's interests. Horse <b>had</b> <b>written</b> <b>the</b> manuscript without knowing any of these details. After his hoax was discovered, Horse held onto the text for the next decade, until he played Myst and 7th Guest and decided the point-and-click adventure genre was a good match for his conspiracy theory-inspired ideas. He later {{said that while the}} story of Myst did not interest him, the game's artwork and the sense of immersion inspired him to immediately begin working on Drowned God in 1994.|$|E

5|$|Mentzer and Mohan {{also wrote}} {{a series of}} generic RPG {{adventure}}s called Gary Gygax Presents Fantasy Master. They also began working on a third line of products, which began with an adventure written by Mentzer called The Convert (1987); Mentzer <b>had</b> <b>written</b> <b>the</b> adventure as an RPGA tournament for D, but TSR {{was not interested in}} publishing it. Mentzer got verbal permission to publish it with New Infinities, but since the permission was not in writing TSR filed an injunction to prevent the adventure's sale, although the injunction was later lifted. The legal costs further drained NIPI of capital.|$|E
5|$|On March 6, 2014, Sony {{announced}} that Screen Gems will distribute a film adaptation of The Last of Us, written by Druckmann and produced by Sam Raimi. By January 2015, Druckmann <b>had</b> <b>written</b> <b>the</b> script's second draft, and performed a read-through with some actors. Very little work occurred following this, as Druckmann stated in April 2016 {{that the film}} had entered development hell. In November 2016, Raimi stated that the film was at a standstill after Sony had a disagreement with Druckmann. Actress Maisie Williams expressed enthusiasm in playing Ellie, and was in talks with both Druckmann and Raimi to take the role.|$|E
5|$|The {{story was}} {{told in the}} form of a letter from a wife and mother to her husband. The writer, Hester Hyman, <b>had</b> <b>written</b> <b>the</b> letter to explain why she had decided to {{sacrifice}} her life for the cause of democracy. While the text of the letter was shown in captions, the pictures first illustrated events described in the early part of the letter, and then showed the circumstances of her death at the hands of a squad of judges led by Judge Dredd.|$|E

5|$|Union Films was {{established}} in 1940 by ethnic Chinese businessmen Ang Hock Liem and Tjoa Ma Tjoen. After the success of its first production, Kedok Ketawa (The Laughing Mask), the director Jo An Djan left for Populair's Film. Union hired new talent, including R Hu, Rd Ariffien, and Saeroen. All three were instrumental {{in the production of}} Harta Berdarah; Hu and Ariffien served as co-directors, both in their debuts, and Saeroen– who <b>had</b> <b>written</b> <b>the</b> commercial successes Terang Boelan (Full Moon; 1937) and Fatima (1938) for other companies– wrote the story. Ariffien credited their hirings to Union's interest in attracting educated Native audiences.|$|E
5|$|When artistic life in Paris resumed {{after the}} Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, Bizet found wider {{opportunities}} {{for the performance of}} his works; his one-act opera Djamileh opened at the Opéra-Comique in May 1872. Although this failed and was withdrawn after 11 performances, it led to a further commission from the theatre, this time for a full-length opera for which Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy would provide the libretto. Halévy, who <b>had</b> <b>written</b> <b>the</b> text for Bizet's student opera Le docteur Miracle (1856), was a cousin of Bizet's wife, Geneviève; he and Meilhac had a solid reputation as the librettists of many of Jacques Offenbach's operettas.|$|E
5|$|Chris Columbus—who <b>had</b> <b>written</b> <b>the</b> Spielberg-produced Gremlins, The Goonies, and Young Sherlock Holmes—was {{hired to}} write the script. His first draft, dated May 3, 1985, changed the main plot device to a Garden of Immortal Peaches. It begins in 1937, with Indiana battling the murderous ghost of Baron Seamus Seagrove III in Scotland. Indiana travels to Mozambique to aid Dr. Clare Clarke (a Katharine Hepburn type {{according}} to Lucas), who has found a 200-year-old pygmy. The pygmy is kidnapped by the Nazis during a boat chase, and Indiana, Clare and Scraggy Brier—an old friend of Indiana—travel up the Zambezi river to rescue him. Indiana is killed in the climactic battle but is resurrected by the Monkey King. Other characters include a cannibalistic African tribe; Nazi Sergeant Gutterbuhg, who has a mechanical arm; Betsy, a stowaway student who is suicidally in love with Indiana; and a pirate leader named Kezure (described as a Toshiro Mifune type), who dies eating a peach {{because he is not}} pure of heart.|$|E
