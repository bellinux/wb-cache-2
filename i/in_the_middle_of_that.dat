Its cradle was in the Draa valley in Tagmadert, the current district of Fezouata between Zagora and Tamegroute.

500|$|All {{acknowledged}} subject {{experts and}} authorities {{agree that there}} is no evidence of cricket having evolved from another bat-and-ball sport and, equally, no evidence that any other bat-and-ball sport evolved from cricket. The authorities include writers Harry Altham, John Arlott, Derek Birley, Arthur Haygarth, David Underdown, Roy Webber and Peter Wynne-Thomas. Their consensus view is that the only thing that can definitely be said about the origin of cricket is that its earliest record is in a late 16th-century court case in Surrey which proves it was played by children in southeast England <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> century. There have been alternative theories of origin but these have been dismissed or ignored by authorities. For example, the writer Andrew Lang claimed in 1912 that cricket evolved from a bat-and-ball game which may have been played in Dál Riata as early as the 6th century and this claim has been dismissed, by Anthony Bateman among others, in terms of [...] "Lang's idiosyncratic belief in the Celtic origin of cricket". It is true that cricket is one of many bat-and-ball sports existing worldwide which have no known origin. Others are the definitely Celtic sports of hurling and shinty. Golf and hockey are other British ball games involving a club or stick while croquet was apparently imported from France and globally there are games such as Sweden's brännboll, Italy's , India's gilli-danda, Finland's pesäpallo and Samoa's kilikiti. However, it is generally believed that cricket essentially belongs to the same family of bat-and-ball games as stoolball, rounders and baseball but whether it evolved from any of these, or vice versa, cannot be determined. There is a 1523 reference to stoolball at a designated field in Oxfordshire; this may then have been a generic term for any game in which a ball is somehow hit with a bat or stick. 18th century references to stoolball in conjunction with cricket clearly indicate that it was a separate activity.|$|E
500|$|To the {{southeast}} of the hall is the stable block which partly surrounds a courtyard. [...] It has a south front of nine bays, the middle three of which project forwards and have a pediment carried on four large Doric pilasters. [...] The block originally had a cupola, but this has been removed. [...] A formal garden has been built between the east wing and the stable block. [...] Standing in this garden is a lead statue of a reclining, naked male figure, said to be Father Tiber, the river god. [...] This formerly stood in the Wilderness garden. [...] On {{the wall behind the}} statue are two carved unicorn heads, the emblem of the Legh family. [...] These formerly stood on pillars at the eastern entrance to the grounds. [...] The statues have been designated as a GradeII listed building. [...] A GradeII building is one that is [...] "nationally important and of special interest". [...] To the south of the formal garden is a stone statue of Napoleon carved by George Turner and dated 1837. [...] To the west of the hall is a ha-ha in rubble sandstone dating from the 18thcentury. It was built to act as a barrier between {{the west side of the}} garden and the deer park beyond it, and is listed GradeII. [...] Immediately to the south of the hall is a circular lawn, in the centre of which is a sundial that probably dates from about 1825. [...] Constructed in ashlar buff sandstone and standing on a pair of circular steps, it consists of an octagonal base with a partly fluted baluster supporting an octagonal moulded capstone. The capstone carries a copper plate inscribed with Roman numerals and the initials [...] "TL", and has a simple triangular gnomon. [...] The sundial is also listed GradeII. [...] Leading south from the lawn is a walk known as the Lime Avenue, which is entered through gates dated 1688. [...] The gates are in wrought iron and the piers in ashlar buff gritstone; these are again listed GradeII. [...] The avenue leads to another GradeII listed building, a structure known as the Shell House, so-called because its interior is decorated with shells and coloured mirrors. [...] It is a single-storey cottage constructed in red brick with buff sandstone dressings. [...] The roof is in stone-slate and the chimney is brick. [...] The wall is in brick with a stone coping. [...] In front of Shell Cottage another sundial, also listed GradeII. [...] This was probably built in the early 18thcentury for John Legh, and moved to its present position <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> century. [...] It is thought that the pillar on which it stands was originally a Saxon cross base. [...] The octagonal copper plate is inscribed with Roman numerals, the longitude of Adlington, and John Legh's initials. [...] To the front of the Shell House is another walk, known as the Yew Walk. [...] At the back and side of the house is a rockery. [...] To the south and west of the Shell House is a wooded area known as the Wilderness, through which runs the River Dean (or Dene). [...] Many of the winding paths created by Charles Legh in the Wilderness are now overgrown, and some of the buildings are in a poor condition, or have collapsed into ruin. [...] One building still in good condition is the Tig House, a small square pavilion overlooking the river, an early example of a building in the Chinoiserie style. [...] It is constructed in red brick and partly clad in black and white timber framing. [...] It has a stone-slate pyramidal roof with a wooden finial, and is listed GradeII. [...] Near to this is the a bridge known as the Chinese Bridge crossing the river, but the summerhouse which once stood on the bridge is no longer present. [...] Another structure in the Wilderness is the Temple of Diana. [...] This is a circular temple with a dome constructed in ashlar buff sandstone. [...] It stands on a stylobate which supports six Doric columns and an entablature. [...] The structure is listed GradeII. [...] This appears to be in good condition, but in the early 2000s was said to be suffering from damp. [...] Other buildings known as the Rathouse and the Hermitage, have been damaged by falling trees. [...] At the north entrance to the grounds is a pair of gate piers that are listed GradeII. [...] The piers are in rusticated ashlar sandstone and are surmounted by ball finials. The gates are iron and are similar to those at the end of the lime avenue. [...] At the other end of the grounds, at the site of the former south approach, is a pair of sandstone gate piers dating from the middle of the 18th century. [...] They originally carried the carved unicorn heads that are now in the formal garden, and were left isolated when the route of the turnpike road was moved. [...] They are listed GradeII.|$|E
