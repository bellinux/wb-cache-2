50|$|In the mid-1870s, a local {{committee}} gathered to discuss surtaxes on alcohol and absinthe {{as the law}} which authorized {{the collection of the}} surtax ceased being in effect on 31 December 1873. A special resolution was recommended to extend the surtax as its proceeds were an important financial resource for Milizac. Without the surtax, the village could not fulfill its commitments or pay for the maintenance of the town hall, reconstruction of the boys' school, the restoration of the cemetery wall, and rural road improvements. Municipal advisers ruled in favor of the surtax system on 15 February 1874. The passed bill, in effect from January 1875 until 31 December 1879 inclusive, applied a surcharge of 20 fr. per <b>hectolitre</b> of <b>pure</b> <b>alcohol</b> in spirits and liqueurs as well as per hectolitre of absinthe.|$|R

40|$|A prospective, randomised, {{comparative}} study {{was performed to}} assess {{the need for a}} <b>pure</b> <b>alcohol</b> injection after an epinephrine injection in the arrest of active peptic ulcer bleeding. Sixty four patients with active ulcer bleeding were enrolled in the study. The two groups (epinephrine and epinephrine plus <b>pure</b> <b>alcohol)</b> were matched for sex, age, site of bleed, endoscopic findings, shock, haemoglobin, and concomitant illness at randomisation. The volume of injected epinephrine in the epinephrine and the epinephrine plus <b>pure</b> <b>alcohol</b> groups mean (SD) was 6. 0 (3. 0) ml and 5. 5 (3. 0) ml respectively (p > 0. 05). The volume of injected <b>pure</b> <b>alcohol</b> in the epinephrine plus <b>pure</b> <b>alcohol</b> group was 1. 9 (1. 1) ml. Bleeding was initially controlled in 31 (97 %) of the epinephrine group and all of the epinephrine plus <b>pure</b> <b>alcohol</b> group. Rebleeding occurred in 11 (36 %) of the epinephrine group and in five (16 %) of the epinephrine plus <b>pure</b> <b>alcohol</b> group (p > 0. 05). Rebleeding was successfully controlled in some patients with treatment by a second injection. Other patients had heat probe thermocoagulation or surgery. Ultimate haemostatic rates were 69 % (22 / 32) and 88 % (28 / 32) for the epinephrine and the epinephrine plus <b>pure</b> <b>alcohol</b> groups respectively (p > 0. 05). The epinephrine plus <b>pure</b> <b>alcohol</b> group achieved a better haemostatic effect for spurting haemorrhage (9 / 10 v 5 / 11, p < 0. 05). The need for emergency operations and blood transfusions were comparable in both groups. The stay in hospital were less in the epinephrine plus <b>pure</b> <b>alcohol</b> group (mean 4. 3 v 7. 1, p < 0. 05). It is concluded that <b>pure</b> <b>alcohol</b> injection after an epinephrine injection can improve the haemostatic rate in patients with spurting haemorrhage and shorten the hospital stay for patients with active bleeding...|$|R

30|$|As to {{the main}} focus of this paper, our results suggest that the amount of {{consumed}} alcohol is a relevant factor in determining fathers’ child care time, influencing negatively and significantly (at 5 %) their weekly hours spent in this activity. Manually computing the average partial effect 17 of one additional gram of <b>pure</b> <b>alcohol</b> per day for the average male drinker -who drinks 9.7 grams of <b>pure</b> <b>alcohol</b> per day and has a BMI of 25.9 - implies a reduction of 2.5 minutes of child care time per week. In our opinion this is a rather large effect. Indeed, drinking one more grass of vodka per day, which contains about 10 grams of <b>pure</b> <b>alcohol,</b> reduces fathers’ child care time by almost half an hour. Along this line, drinking 5 glasses more would imply a reduction of more than two hours with respect to an average of 9.7 hours.|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} two decades, total (<b>pure)</b> <b>alcohol</b> {{consumption}} in Australia has declined by about 31 % and currently {{it is at the}} same level {{as it was in the}} 1950 s. Australians consumed about 10 litres of <b>pure</b> <b>alcohol</b> per person in 1982 and now the level has declined to about 7 litres of <b>pure</b> <b>alcohol</b> per person. During the last four decades, per capita beer consumption has reached a peak of 140 litres in 1975 and has fallen to a low 93 litres in 1999; wine consumption has increased four-fold while spirits consumption has stayed around the same level. This paper, using the Australian consumption data for beer, wine and spirits for the period 1956 - 1999, aims to explain the change in consumption patterns of beer, wine and spirits by considering the effects due to changes in economic and demographic factors. The results show that while income and prices significantly influence the consumption patterns of alcohol, the increasing Australian elderly population also plays an important role. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: In Australia and elsewhere, fiscal {{measures}} such as alcohol taxation are a commonly used intervention and cost-effective strategy to reduce alcohol consumption and associated harm. However, alcohol taxation policies distort the market for alcohol, specifically increasing the marginal cost of alcohol. It is proposed that a volumetric tax, which taxes alcohol equally across all beverage types, is less distortive of consumer preferences and more efficient at reducing alcohol consumption than the current Australian tax model, where taxes are charged at varying amounts per litre of <b>pure</b> <b>alcohol,</b> depending on the beverage type. Objective: This paper quantifies the effect of four different alcohol taxation systems, relative to the current Australian system: {{two different types of}} volumetric taxation (deadweight loss neutral and tax revenue neutral); the recent strategy trialled in Australia of increasing the tax only on ready-to-drink alcoholic beverages (i. e. premixed spirits); and a tiered tax system, which may be more politically acceptable. Methods: A partial equilibrium approach was used to measure taxation revenue, consumer welfare and consumption in alcohol markets. Estimates of taxation revenue, consumer welfare and consumption were first calculated for 2008 and then compared with the four scenarios considered. Results: Relative to the previous alcohol taxation scheme in Australia, the taxation strategy that increased the tax solely on ready-to-drink alcoholic beverages increased taxation revenue by 479 ?million Australian dollars ($A), reduced <b>pure</b> <b>alcohol</b> consumption by 754 ? 000 litres and increased the net deadweight loss of taxation by $A 62 ?million. For a tax-neutral approach, for the same level of taxation revenue as is currently generated, a volumetric tax could substantially reduce the cost of taxation (as described by the net loss in consumer welfare) by $A 177 ?million and reduce <b>pure</b> <b>alcohol</b> consumption by 4 68 ? 000 litres. Under a deadweight loss-neutral scenario, for the same amount of deadweight loss generated from the previous taxation scenario, taxation revenue could be increased by $A 1153 ?million, in addition to reducing <b>pure</b> <b>alcohol</b> consumption by 4 ? 316 ? 000 litres. A tiered taxation regime, as modelled here, could decrease <b>pure</b> <b>alcohol</b> consumption by 2 ? 616 ? 000 litres whilst increasing taxation revenue by $A 1101 ?million. However, this scenario would also increase the deadweight loss of taxation by $A 113 ?million. Conclusion: From these scenarios, it can be shown that, for the same tax revenue, consumer welfare can be reduced or, for the same level of loss to consumer welfare, taxation revenue can be increased. Both these scenarios result in a reduction of <b>pure</b> <b>alcohol</b> consumption. Griffith Health, School of MedicineNo Full Tex...|$|R
