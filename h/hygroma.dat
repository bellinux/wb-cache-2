25|$|Usually, fetuses with Turner {{syndrome}} can {{be identified}} by abnormal ultrasound findings (i.e., heart defect, kidney abnormality, cystic <b>hygroma,</b> ascites). In a study of 19 European registries, 67.2% of prenatally diagnosed cases of Turner Syndrome were detected by abnormalities on ultrasound. 69.1% of cases had one anomaly present, and 30.9% had two or more anomalies.|$|E

Larger <b>hygromas</b> may cause secondary localized mass effects on the adjacent brain parenchyma, enough to cause a neurologic deficit or other symptoms. Acute subdural <b>hygromas</b> can be a potential neurosurgical emergency, requiring decompression. Acute <b>hygromas</b> are typically a result of head trauma—they are a relatively common posttraumatic lesion—but can also develop following neurosurgical procedures, and have also been associated {{with a variety of}} conditions, including dehydration in the elderly, lymphoma and connective tissue diseases.|$|R
40|$|Children with lymphangiomatous {{macroglossia}} {{often have}} difficulty eating and talking, and their airways may be compromised because of bleeding and infection, especially when extensive cervicomediastinal cystic <b>hygromas</b> are present. We report {{a case of}} lymphangiomatous macroglossia associated with extensive cystic <b>hygromas</b> in the cervicomediastinal region. The 3 -year-old girl was treated with anterior wedge reduction of the tongue, needle aspiration of the cervicomediastinal cystic <b>hygromas,</b> and systemic steroids and antibiotics.

50|$|Cystic <b>hygromas</b> are {{increasingly}} diagnosed by prenatal ultrasonography. A common symptom is a neck growth. It {{may be found}} at birth, or discovered later in an infant after an upper respiratory tract infection. Cystic <b>hygromas</b> can grow very large and may affect breathing and swallowing. Some symptoms may include a mass or lump in the mouth, neck, cheek, or tongue. It feels like a large fluid-filled sac. In addition, cystic <b>hygromas</b> {{can be found in}} other body parts such as the arm, chest, legs, groin, and buttocks. Cystic <b>hygromas</b> are also often seen in Turner's syndrome, although a patient who does not have Turner's syndrome can present with this condition.|$|R
50|$|A {{baby with}} a prenatally {{diagnosed}} cystic <b>hygroma</b> should be {{delivered in a}} major medical center {{equipped to deal with}} neonatal complications, such as a neonatal intensive care unit. An obstetrician usually decides the method of delivery. If the cystic <b>hygroma</b> is large, a cesarean section may be performed. After birth, infants with a persistent cystic <b>hygroma</b> must be monitored for airway obstruction. A thin needle may be used to reduce the volume of the cystic <b>hygroma</b> to prevent facial deformities and airway obstruction. Close observation of the baby by a neonatologist after birth is recommended. If resolution of the cystic <b>hygroma</b> does not occur before birth, a pediatric surgeon should be consulted.|$|E
50|$|In cystic <b>hygroma,</b> large cysts {{can cause}} dysphagia, {{respiratory}} problems, and serious infection if they involve the neck. Patients with cystic <b>hygroma</b> should receive cytogenetic analysis {{to determine if}} they have chromosomal abnormalities, and parents should receive genetic counseling because this condition can recur in subsequent pregnancies.|$|E

40|$|Background A female fetus {{with massive}} truncal-limb hydrops and large, loculated, nuchal <b>hygromas</b> in midgestation is highly {{likely to have}} Turner syndrome. This {{phenotype}} is recognized to be usually lethal, with only more mildly affected fetuses surviving to term birth. Methods The morphology and morphometrics of 117 midgestation fetuses with phenotypic Turner syndrome were analyzed. Results More than 90 % of fetuses with phenotypic Turner syndrome {{were found to have}} heart weights below the 2. 5 centile, as well as lung hypoplasia and restricted limb growth for brain weight standards, although brain weight was only mildly reduced for gestational age. In contrast, subnormal heart weight was much less common among fetuses with other etiologies of hydrops, <b>hygromas,</b> or pleural effusions. Conclusions We hypothesize that myocardial hypoplasia is a primary defect in Turner syndrome, and it leads to or is a major contributor to the phenotypic features that end in midgestational death.

50|$|A cystic <b>hygroma,</b> {{also known}} as cystic lymphangioma and macrocystic lymphatic malformation, is an often {{congenital}} multiloculated lymphatic lesion that can arise anywhere, but is classically found in the left posterior triangle of the neck and armpits. This {{is the most common}} form of lymphangioma. It contains large cyst-like cavities containing lymph, a watery fluid that circulates throughout the lymphatic system. Microscopically, cystic <b>hygroma</b> consists of multiple locules filled with lymph. In the depth, the locules are quite big but they decrease in size towards the surface.|$|E
50|$|Lymphangiomas have {{traditionally}} been classified into three subtypes: capillary and cavernous lymphangiomas and cystic <b>hygroma.</b> This classification is based on their microscopic characteristics. A fourth subtype, the hemangiolymphangioma is also recognized.|$|E

50|$|A {{subdural}} <b>hygroma</b> is {{a collection}} of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), without blood, located under the dural membrane. Most subdural hygromas are believed to be derived from chronic subdural hematomas. They are commonly seen in elderly patients after minor trauma but can also be seen in children after an infection. One of the common causes of subdural <b>hygroma</b> is a sudden decrease in pressure as a result of placing a ventricular shunt. This can lead to leakage of CSF into the subdural space especially in cases with moderate to severe brain atrophy. In these cases the symptoms such as mild fever, headache, drowsiness and confusion can be seen, which are relieved by draining this subdural fluid.|$|E
50|$|Cystic <b>hygroma</b> is {{also known}} as lymphatic {{malformation}}. Currently, the medical field prefers to use the term lymphatic malformation because the term cystic <b>hygroma</b> means water tumor. Lymphatic malformation is more commonly used now because it is a sponge-like collection of abnormal growth that contains clear lymphatic fluid. The fluid collects within the cysts or channels, usually in the soft tissue. Cystic hygromas occur when the lymphatic vessels that make up the lymphatic system are not formed properly. There are two types of lymphatic malformations. They are macrocystic lymphatic malformations, large cysts, and microcystic, small cysts. A person may have only one kind of the malformation or can have a mixture of both macro and micro cysts.|$|E
5000|$|FNA {{and surgery}} {{is often not}} recommended, these can {{introduce}} infection and the <b>hygroma</b> will return larger. Donut bandage and soft bedding are key to treating. In the past it was common for veterinarians to treat hygromas by aspiration (using a syringe and drawing the fluid out) or surgically placing a drain. This can address the symptom, but does not treat {{the cause of the}} <b>hygroma.</b> In addition any incision at a joint can be difficult to close and may result in an open sore. Consequently, the recommended treatment of choice for most hygromas is no longer aspiration or surgery, but commercially available elbow pads made for the treatment of this condition.i ...|$|E
