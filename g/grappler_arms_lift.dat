40|$|A first {{space vehicle}} is {{attached}} {{with a second}} space vehicle which includes a rocket propulsion nozzle having a combustion chamber upstream from the nozzle throat. Apparatus 10 includes an elongate <b>grappling</b> <b>arm</b> 12 extending from the first space vehicle, a pair of inflatable bladders 16, 18 positioned about the <b>grappling</b> <b>arm</b> for engaging an inner surface of the combustion chamber upon inflation. {{and a pair of}} rear bladders 20, 22 positioned about the <b>grappling</b> <b>arm</b> for engaging an inner surface of the nozzle downstream from the combustion chamber upon inflation for aligning the <b>grappling</b> <b>arm</b> and the rocket propulsion nozzle. A pressurized fluid source 24 is provided on the first space vehicle for supplying fluid pressure to the inflatable bladders. and a fluid control valve manifold 30 selectively controls the release of pressurized fluid to the bladders. According to the method of the invention. the <b>grappling</b> <b>arm</b> is inserted into the rocket propulsion nozzle. and the control valves are actuated to first inflate the front bladders and thereby interconnect the <b>grappling</b> <b>arm</b> and the rocket propulsion nozzle. The rear bladders are subsequently inflated to align a central axis of the <b>grappling</b> <b>arm</b> with a central axis of the rocket propulsion nozzle. Inflation of the rear bladders provides an axial reaction load to balance the axial load provided by the front bladders. Attaching the vehicles in space may be controlled from the earth by activating the control valves to inflate the bladders. The cost of attaching space vehicles is significantly reduced by attaching a <b>grappling</b> <b>arm</b> on one vehicle with the existing rocket propulsion nozzle of another vehicle...|$|R

40|$|Background and aim : This study {{examines}} what effect <b>arm</b> <b>lifts</b> {{have on the}} movement of the center of pressure (COP) during quiet standing. Questions that were investigated were; is there evidence of Anticipatory Postural Adjustments (APA) in the opposite direction of upcoming arm movements and where is the COP positioned {{at the end of the}} <b>arm</b> <b>lift?</b> Methods: A 500 Hz ProReflex motion capture system and AMTI force platform were used to capture the participants’ unilateral and bilateral <b>arm</b> <b>lifts</b> in the diagonal, forward, and sideways direction. These measurements allowed for the APA and COP Arm Horizontal variables to be calculated. Results: The results indicated that there was no evidence for APA in the opposite direction of the upcoming <b>arm</b> movements. Before <b>lifting</b> one <b>arm</b> sideways the participants leaned in the same direction as the upcoming <b>arm</b> <b>lift.</b> When the <b>arms</b> had reached their horizontal position, the COP was typically positioned in the forward direction. The COP was positioned further away from the baseline when the lifting had occurred in the diagonal and forward directions than in the sideways direction. When one arm had reached the horizontal position when lifting sideways, the COP was positioned in the same direction as the <b>arm</b> <b>lift.</b> Discussion: In contrast to prior studies, APA was in the same direction as the upcoming arm movement. As expected, the participants leaned in the forward direction when both arms had reached their horizontal position. The participants leaned in the same direction as the previous <b>arm</b> <b>lift</b> when only one <b>arm</b> was <b>lifted</b> in the sideways direction. Further analyses could focus on the COP movements during the <b>arm</b> <b>lifts.</b> The study can be extended to investigating how postural control is affected in other age groups and patient groups. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: There is {{considerable}} professional debate over which technique {{is the best}} for lifting. The {{aim of this study}} is to compare three static lifting styles, the stoop, semi-squat and <b>arm</b> <b>lift,</b> using maximum isometric voluntary contraction (MIVC) as one indicator for recommending a lifting style. Methods: Thirty healthy women (mean age: 22. 37 years) participated in this quasi-experimental study. They performed the tests in static postures by standing on the platform of the Lift TrackTM and pulling the dynamometer of the instrument with maximum effort in three lifting styles: the stoop, semi-squat and <b>arm</b> <b>lift.</b> The subjects warmed-up by practicing the lifts first. The mean MIVC from the two other sets of lifts were used for statistical analysis by repeated measurements and SPSS (ver. 10) software. Results: There were significant differences between the MIVC of the three lifting styles in this study. The largest MIVC was for the semi-squat lift and was the least was for the <b>arm</b> <b>lift</b> (p< 0. 001). The MIVC of the stoop lift was larger than that of the <b>arm</b> <b>lift</b> (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: The largest MIVC for the semi-squat lift suggests that this style is useful for lifting objects from the floor. The differences in biomechanical and muscle pattern activity changes could explain these results. It seems that activation of the quadriceps muscles in the semi-squat lift was a main factor for producing more MIVC, so when this style is recommended for lifting, attention to the power of the quadriceps is important...|$|R

40|$|Objective The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{mechanical}} activity of the neck muscles during loaded <b>arm</b> <b>lifting</b> tasks in individuals with long-standing disability after anterior cervical decompression and fusion (ACDF) with that of healthy controls. Methods Ten individuals (mean age, 60 years; SD, 7. 1) who underwent ACDF (10 - 13 years previously) for cervical disc disease and 10 healthy age- and sex-matched controls participated in the study. Ultrasonography was used to investigate the degree of deformation and deformation rate of ventral and dorsal neck muscles at the C 4 segmental level during a single (1  × arm flexion to 120 °) and repeated (10  × arm flexion to 90 °) loaded arm elevation condition. Results The ACDF group showed greater deformation and deformation rate of the longus capitis (P =. 02) and deformation rate of the sternocleidomastoid (P =. 04) during the 120 ° <b>arm</b> <b>lift.</b> For repeated 90 ° <b>arm</b> <b>lift,</b> there was a significant group effect with higher deformation rate values observed in the longus capitis (P =. 005 -. 01) and multifidus (P =. 03) muscles in the ACDF group. Muscle behavior did not change the repeated <b>arm</b> <b>lifts</b> (no group × time interactions) for either the ventral or the dorsal muscles. Conclusions For study participants, greater muscle mechanical activity levels were observed in the ventral and multifidus muscles of patients with persistent symptoms after ACDF. These differences may indicate altered motor strategy in this patient group when performing the upper limb task and may need to be considered when prescribing exercise for postsurgical rehabilitation.

40|$|Background: Pregnancy-related lumbopelvic pain is common. More than 30 % {{of women}} have {{persistent}} pain 3 months after giving birth. There is no consensus regarding the pathology. However, coordination of muscle activity by appropriate timing and amplitude is necessary for maintaining adequate stability in the lumbopelvic area. The aim {{was to develop a}} method using surface electromyography to detect a feed-forward response in the pelvic floor muscles during limb movements performed at a comfortable speed applicable in future studies for women with lumbopelvic pain. Methods: Ten parous women with no lumbopelvic pain in the past 12 months were included. Surface electromyographic activity was recorded from the pelvic floor muscles and unilaterally from transversus abdominis/internal oblique, rectus abdominis, erector spinae, hip adductors, rectus femoris and deltoid. The subjects performed leg lift in supine and <b>arm</b> <b>lift</b> from standing. The electromyographic onset was related to the initiation of the movement. Findings: In the majority of the women the electromyographic onsets of the pelvic floor muscles occurred before the movement was initiated, regardless of whether it was a leg or an <b>arm</b> <b>lift.</b> In addition. electromyographic onsets for the other muscles, except the rectus abdominis during the <b>arm</b> <b>lift,</b> also occurred prior to the movements. Interpretation: The findings suggest a feed-forward response in the pelvic floor muscles during leg and <b>arm</b> <b>lifts</b> in women who had previously given birth and were without lumbopelvic pain. Movements performed at a comfortable speed seem to be useful in order to detect such a response.
