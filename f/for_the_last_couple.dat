5|$|Miller Huggins, {{who served}} as the Yankees' manager through 1929, had {{attempted}} to acquire Ruffing from the Red Sox <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> years of his Yankees' tenure. When Ruffing told him that he was considering moving to the outfield, Huggins told him he should continue as a pitcher. Bob Shawkey, a former pitcher who succeeded Huggins as the Yankees new manager in 1930, had convinced Ed Barrow, the Yankees' general manager, to acquire Ruffing. Shawkey believed he could change Ruffing's approach to pitching to obtain better results. Shawkey worked with Ruffing to change his pitching delivery, so that Ruffing used his body more. This helped Ruffing save his arm strength for the later innings of the game. The trade of Ruffing for Durst is now reckoned {{as one of the most}} lopsided trades in baseball history; Durst was a reserve outfielder who always batted at the bottom of the lineup when he was used. The 1930 season proved to be Durst's worst year in the majors. Ruffing had a 0–3 record with the Red Sox before the trade. He won 15 games for the Yankees after the trade, losing only five games.|$|E

The Dodgers made a trade early in spring training, sending pitcher Chase De Jong to the Seattle Mariners for minor league infielder Drew Jackson and minor league pitcher Aneurys Zabala. With most of the positions in the lineup locked in before camp, the major battle was <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> of spots in the starting rotation behind Clayton Kershaw, Rich Hill and Kenta Maeda. In the mix were veterans Brandon McCarthy, Scott Kazmir and Hyun-jin Ryu, {{all of whom were}} coming back from injuries as well as Alex Wood, Ross Stripling, Julio Urias and Brock Stewart. McCarthy and Ryu won the rotation spots, with Stripling and Wood in the bullpen to start.|$|E
25|$|Pinot Meunier {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely planted grapes in France but it is rather obscure to most wine {{drinkers}} and will rarely be seen on a wine label. The grape has been favored by vine growers in northern France due to its ability to bud and ripen more reliably than Pinot noir. The vine's tendency to bud later in the growing season and ripen earlier makes it less susceptible to developing coulure which can greatly reduce a prospective crop. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> of centuries, Pinot Meunier has been the most widely planted Champagne grape, accounting for more than 40% of the region's entire plantings. It is most prevalent in the cooler, north facing vineyards of the Vallee de la Marne and in the Aisne department. It is also widely grown in the Aube region in vineyards where Pinot noir and Chardonnay would not fully ripen.|$|E

500|$|Neutral Milk Hotel {{formed in}} 1989 as an {{offshoot}} of Milk, a high school musical project of singer-songwriter Jeff Mangum, and the band was largely a Mangum solo project in the group's earlier days. The group {{was a part of}} The Elephant 6 Recording Company, a collective of musicians that includes, among others, notable indie rock bands The Apples in Stereo, The Olivia Tremor Control, and Of Montreal. The 1993 single [...] "Everything Is" [...] was the band's first release, and it would later be reissued as an EP with additional tracks. The band's first studio album, On Avery Island, was released on the independent label Merge, and has sold a relatively high 5,000 copies. Afterwards, the band began to tour for the first time, and grew to include horns player Scott Spillane, multi-instrumentalist Julian Koster, and drummer Jeremy Barnes. In 1998 the band released In the Aeroplane over the Sea on Merge, an album which has since {{become one of the most}} popular and acclaimed indie rock albums of the 1990s.

500|$|Howe {{was opposed}} in his riding by CCF {{candidate}} Doug Fisher, a {{local high school}} teacher. Fisher's campaign was well financed, with support from his party, the unions, {{and a number of}} corporate enemies Howe had made over the years. Fisher was able to buy up the key time on the local television station—Howe initially scheduled no television appearances. The voters of Port Arthur saw Fisher on television every night, explaining why the Liberals had gone wrong in his view, and what his party proposed to do to correct matters. Called back to his riding after the remainder of his disastrous Prairie tour was canceled, Howe found that Fisher's appeals had caused defections among Liberals. Howe managed to get TV time just before the election and according to Bothwell and Kilbourn [...] "treated his viewers to the sight of a tired, harsh old man, telling them that the nice young fellow that they had been seeing on television <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> of months was, if not a communist himself, then associated with the communists. No one believed him." [...] Fisher defeated Howe by over a thousand votes. Howe was gracious in defeat, shaking Fisher's hand at the television station, and assuring the member-elect's mother, long a Howe admirer, that there were many things for him to do. [...] Howe's defeat came as the Liberals still led narrowly in the reported returns. The Tories forged ahead, and took the greater number of seats, 112 to 105. [...] St. Laurent could have remained in office until Diefenbaker and the Tories defeated him in the House, but chose not to—a course with which Howe agreed. The Liberals left office on 21 June 1957, with Howe the only remaining minister of those sworn in with Mackenzie King in 1935.|$|E

40|$|Modern large telescopes such as TAO, LSST, TMT and EELT require 0. 9 m- 4 m {{monolithic}} convex secondary mirrors. The fabrication {{and testing}} of these large convex secondary mirrors of astronomical telescopes is getting challenging as the aperture of the mirror is getting bigger. The biggest challenge to fabricate these large convex aspheric mirrors is to measure the surface figure to a few nanometers, while maintaining the testing and fabrication cycle to be efficient to minimize <b>the</b> downtime. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> a <b>couple</b> of decades there was huge advancement in the metrology and fabrication of large aspheric secondary mirrors.

40|$|Ad hoc {{networks}} are peer to peer, autonomous networks comprised of wireless mobile devices. The ease {{and speed of}} deployment of these networks makes them ideal for battlefield communications, disaster recovery and other such applications where fixed infrastructure is not readily available.

Specifically in unicast and multicast routing and security issues. In this thesis, we address the multicast routing problem for ad hoc networks. We present a novel multicast routing protocol called the source grouped flooding protocol. The protocol creates multicast routes between the source and group members based on hop count distance constraints. We also propose a probabilistic data forwarding mechanism to achieve efficient data dissemination. We present simulation results that capture the performance of our protocol against parameters that characterize an ad hoc network.
