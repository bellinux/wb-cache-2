40|$|The {{management}} of ventricular tachycardia (VT) has evolved considerably in recent times. The {{majority of patients}} with VT have structural heart disease and often <b>implantable</b> <b>defibrillators.</b> <b>Implantable</b> <b>defibrillators</b> can terminate ventricular arrhythmias and prevent sudden death but do not prevent these arrhythmias from occurring. Ventricular tachycardia may also occur in patients without structural heart disease and although these patients generally have a benign prognosis, the symptoms can be significant.

40|$|Background: <b>Implantable</b> <b>defibrillators</b> are {{the most}} {{effective}} means to prevent sudden death in patients with malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias. The availability of this type of devices is limited in Chile, due to their high price. Aim: To report the first patients treated with <b>implantable</b> <b>defibrillators</b> in our hospital. Patients and methods: Nine males and one female aged 13 to 65 years old are reported. Three presented with ventricular fibrillation (presenting out of the hospital in three) and the rest had ventricular tachycardia resistant to drugs or radiofrequency ablation. Results: All implants were performed using intracardiac electrodes. The generator was implanted in the pectoral region in nine and in the abdomen in one. A successful defibrillation was obtained with less than 15 J in four patients, with 20 J in three and with 24 J in three. There were no complications during the procedure. After a 12 months follow up, four patients have been treated by the implantable device. One of these subjects had a ventricular fibrillation in two occasions. One patient died of a bronchopneumonia two years after the implant. Conclusions: <b>Implantable</b> <b>defibrillators</b> are an effective therapy for the treatment of malignant ventricular arrhythmias with a high risk of sudden death...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{develop a}} model to assess the cost-efficacy of the <b>implantable</b> cardioverter <b>defibrillator</b> to prevent sudden death. The model must be {{sufficiently}} flexible to allow the use of cost and survival figures derived from different sources. SETTING [...] The {{study was conducted in}} a teaching hospital department of cardiology with experience of 40 <b>implantable</b> cardioverter <b>defibrillator</b> implants and a large database of over 500 survivors of myocardial infarction. PROCEDURE [...] The basic costs of screening tests, stay in hospital, and purchase of <b>implantable</b> cardioverter <b>defibrillators</b> were derived from St George's Hospital during 1991. To assess the cost-efficacy of various strategies for the use of <b>implantable</b> cardioverter <b>defibrillators,</b> survival data taken from published studies or from our own database. Implications of the national cost of the various strategies were calculated by estimating the number of patients a year requiring implantation of a defibrillator if the strategy was adopted. RESULTS [...] Use of <b>implantable</b> cardioverter <b>defibrillators</b> in survivors of cardiac arrest costs between 22, 400 pounds and 57, 000 pounds for each year of life saved. Most of the strategies proposed by the current generation of <b>implantable</b> cardioverter <b>defibrillator</b> trials have cost efficacies in the same range, and adoption of any one of these strategies in the United Kingdom could cost between 2 million pounds and 100 million pounds a year. Future technical and medical developments mean that cost-efficacy may be improved by up to 80 %. Due to the limitations of screening tests currently available restriction on the use of <b>implantable</b> cardioverter <b>defibrillators</b> to those groups where it seems highly cost-effective will result in a small impact on overall mortality from sudden cardiac death. CONCLUSION [...] Present and possible future applications of the <b>implantable</b> cardioverter <b>defibrillator</b> seem expensive when compared with currently accepted treatments. Technical and medical developments are, however, likely to result in a dramatic improvement in cost efficacy over the next few years...|$|R

In 1992, Mr. Imran invented a cooled RF ablation catheter for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias. This invention became the initial product of Cardiac Pathways, and is now widely used by cardiac electro-physiologists. In 1995, he developed a low-pressure balloon and aspirator system for use in catheter based interventions. Mr. Imran was the first to articulate the concept of embolic protection during high-risk interventions. Mr. Imran’s device became the primary innovation for Percusurge, which was acquired by Medtronic in December 2000. In the medical field Imran's interest is to develop medical devices that blur the distinction between organic and synthetic and advance patient treatment options.|$|E
50|$|Implantable {{medical devices}} require {{batteries}} that can deliver a steady, reliable power source {{for as long}} as possible. These applications call for a battery that has a low self-discharge rate, for when it’s not in use, and a high power rate, for when it needs to be used, {{especially in the case of}} an <b>implantable</b> <b>defibrillator.</b> Also, users of the product will want a battery that can go through many cycles, so these devices will not have to be replaced or serviced often. Thin film lithium ion batteries have the ability to meet these requirements. The advancement from a liquid to a solid electrolyte has allowed these batteries to take almost any shape without the worry of leaking, and it has been shown that certain types of thin film rechargeable lithium batteries can last for around 50,000 cycles. Another advantage to these thin film batteries is that they can be arranged in series to give a larger voltage equal to the sum of the individual battery voltages. This fact can be used in reducing the “footprint” of the battery, or the size of the space needed for the battery, in the design of a device.|$|E
40|$|Background: Cardiac {{pacemakers}} and <b>implantable</b> <b>defibrillators</b> {{are potentially}} susceptible to electromagnetic interferences {{as they have}} complex circuitry for sensing and communication purposes.

Related articles and references of relevant articles were also searched for suitable studies. Results: Fourteen studies on pacemakers and eight studies on <b>implantable</b> <b>defibrillators</b> were identified. No dangerous malfunction was found in any of the analyzed studies, but most of the studies noted interference with device function when the phone was operated very close to the device. Interference was minimally in those devices with built in feed-through filters for eliminating electromagnetic interference. Device programming and interrogation were the most susceptible phases of operation. Summary: Cellular phones are likely to interfere with implantable rhythm devices if operated i...|$|R
40|$|Objectives Arrhythmogenic right {{ventricular}} cardiomyopathy {{caused by}} a TMEM 43 p. S 358 L mutation is a fully penetrant autosomal dominant cause of sudden cardiac death where prophylactic <b>implantable</b> cardioverter <b>defibrillator</b> therapy significantly reduces mortality by returning lethal cardiac rhythms to normal. This qualitative study assessed the psychological ramifications of the <b>implantable</b> cardioverter <b>defibrillator</b> on recipients, their spouses and their mutation negative siblings. Design Qualitative interview study. Participants Twenty-one individuals (nine mutation positive, eight mutation negative and four spouses) from 15 families completed semi-structured interviews. Results No theoretical assumptions about the data were made: inductive sub-coding was accomplished with the constant comparison method and cohesive themes across all respondent interviews were determined. All interviewees had {{a family history of}} sudden cardiac death and appropriate <b>implantable</b> cardioverter <b>defibrillator</b> therapy in themselves or family members. Average length of time with an <b>implantable</b> cardioverter <b>defibrillator</b> was 10 years. Major themes included: (1) acceptance and gratitude, (2) grudging acceptance, (3) psychological effects (on emotional and psychological well-being; functioning of the broader family unit; and relationships), and (4) practical concerns (on clothes, travel, loss of driving licence and the effects of an <b>implantable</b> cardioverter <b>defibrillator</b> discharge). These affected all family members, regardless of mutation status.
