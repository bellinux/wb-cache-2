5|$|All of the wharves {{along the}} coast of Mississippi were {{reportedly}} ruined. In Mobile, Alabama, the storm uprooted trees and damaged several buildings, including a church. Tides rose several feet above normal, flooding low-lying streets such that fishermen were able to deliver their catches directly to market by boat. Some businesses sustained minor water damage, but overall, the city was spared any significant <b>destruction,</b> <b>and</b> received little impact on shipping. To the east, there were unconfirmed reports of significant damage to wharves and warehouses along the Florida Panhandle, but these accounts may have been exaggerated by rival companies.|$|E
5|$|As of June 26, 2011, the {{conservation}} status of Dendroaspis angusticeps {{has not been}} assessed by the IUCN. The eastern green mamba is, however, a fairly common species of snake throughout its geographical range, and populations {{are believed to be}} stable. Large concentrations of two to three individuals per hectare have been documented in coastal Kenya and southern Tanzania, and in one instance a group of five eastern green mambas were seen in a single tree. Although populations of this species are stable, habitat <b>destruction</b> <b>and</b> deforestation may pose a possible threat to this species.|$|E

5|$|As {{the bird}} became extinct before {{significant}} field observations could be made, not much {{is known about}} its behavior. The Lānai hookbill is only known to have eaten {{the fruit of the}} ōpuhe; however, it is unlikely that its unique bill would have developed to eat fruit, and {{it may have been a}} snail specialist. The hookbill has not been seen since 1918, and by 1940 nearly all of Lānai's forests were converted into pineapple fields, destroying the bird’s habitat. The combination of habitat <b>destruction</b> <b>and</b> the introduction of feral cats and rats are thought to have led to the Lānai hookbill’s extinction.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{reproducing}} readily {{in captivity}} {{and being the}} most populous lemur in zoos worldwide, numbering more than 2,000 individuals, the ring-tailed lemur is listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List due to habitat <b>destruction</b> <b>and</b> hunting for bush meat and the exotic pet trade. As of early 2017, {{the population in the}} wild is believed to have crashed as low as 2,000 individuals due to habitat loss, poaching and hunting, making them far more critically endangered.|$|E
5|$|<b>Destruction</b> <b>and</b> {{encroachment}} {{of habitat}} by humans is another threat to loggerhead sea turtles. Optimum nesting beaches are open-sand beaches above the high-tide line. However, beach development deprives them of suitable nesting areas, {{forcing them to}} nest closer to the surf. Urbanization often leads to the siltation of sandy beaches, decreasing their viability. Construction of docks and marinas can destroy near-shore habitats. Boat traffic and dredging degrades habitat and can also injure or kill turtles when boats collide with turtles {{at or near the}} surface.|$|E
