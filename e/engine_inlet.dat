5|$|Kulwicki {{died in an}} {{airplane}} crash on Thursday April 1, 1993. He was returning from an appearance at the Knoxville Hooters in a Hooters corporate plane on a short flight across Tennessee before the Sunday spring race at Bristol. The plane slowed and crashed just before final approach at Tri-Cities Regional Airport near Blountville. The National Transportation Safety Board attributed the crash to the pilot's failure to use the airplane's anti-ice system to clear ice from the <b>engine</b> <b>inlet</b> system.|$|E
25|$|The left <b>engine</b> <b>inlet</b> {{separated}} from the engine during the flight. Debris from the <b>engine</b> <b>inlet</b> damaged the airplane fuselage, wing and empennage.|$|E
25|$|The {{point of}} impact is usually any {{forward-facing}} edge of the vehicle such as a wing leading edge, nose cone, jet engine cowling or <b>engine</b> <b>inlet.</b>|$|E
25|$|The F/A-18E/F's radar {{cross-section}} was reduced greatly from some aspects, mainly {{the front and}} rear. The design of the <b>engine</b> <b>inlets</b> reduces the aircraft's frontal {{radar cross-section}}. The alignment of the leading edges of the <b>engine</b> <b>inlets</b> is designed to scatter radiation to the sides. Fixed fanlike reflecting structures in the inlet tunnel divert radar energy away from the rotating fan blades.|$|R
50|$|To {{protect the}} <b>engine</b> <b>inlets,</b> another wire ran diagonally from the {{nose to the}} slipper tank on each wing.|$|R
50|$|De-icing {{techniques}} are also employed {{to ensure that}} <b>engine</b> <b>inlets</b> and various sensors {{on the outside of}} the aircraft are clear of ice or snow.|$|R
25|$|Adding to the plane's {{troubles}} was the pilots' {{decision to}} maneuver closely behind a DC-9 that was taxiing {{just ahead of}} them prior to takeoff, due to their mistaken belief that the warmth from the DC-9's engines would melt the snow and ice that had accumulated on Flight 90's wings. This action—which went specifically against flight manual recommendations for an icing situation—actually contributed to additional icing on the 737. The exhaust gases from the other aircraft melted the snow on the wings, but during takeoff, instead of falling off the plane, this slush mixture froze on the wings' leading edges and the <b>engine</b> <b>inlet</b> nose cone.|$|E
25|$|The Scorpion {{had flown}} 76.4 hours in 41 test flights by 19 May 2014; no planned flights were {{cancelled}} due to mechanical or maintenance issues. Incremental improvements {{were to be}} made to the aircraft over the course of testing. Participation in the Farnborough International Airshow in 2014 accelerated changes; modifications included an <b>engine</b> <b>inlet</b> ice protection system and a metal inlet leading edge in place of the composite one for flying in a broader range of weather conditions, a cockpit ladder so the pilot does not need a ground crew ladder, an onboard oxygen-generating system in place of oxygen bottles, and other non-urgent items. The modified Scorpion resumed flights on 1 June 2014. In July 2014, the Scorpion made its first public appearance at Farnborough Airshow.|$|E
25|$|One major {{advantage}} of the new design was its larger fuel capacity, {{which has been a}} major problem for the original FD2. The Delta 2 had often run out of fuel while still accelerating, thereby never reaching its full performance. The modifications for the 221 meant it was not capable of the same levels of performance; however, speeds of Mach 1.6 were attained during its test flights. In total, the BAC 221 featured a new wing, <b>engine</b> <b>inlet</b> configuration, a Rolls-Royce Avon RA.28, modified vertical stabilizer and a lengthened undercarriage to mimic Concorde's attitude on the ground. It first flew in this form on 1 May 1964. The sole 221 was used for various test flight conducted from 1964 until 1973, after which the aircraft was soon after preserved and placed on public display.|$|E
40|$|The {{method and}} basic {{elements}} of computer solutions for both potential flow and viscous flow calculations for <b>engine</b> <b>inlets</b> are described. The procedure is applicable to subsonic conventional (CTOL), short-haul (STOL), and vertical takeoff (VTOL) aircraft engine nacelles operating in a compressible viscous flow. The calculated results compare well with measured surface pressure distributions {{for a number of}} model inlets. The paper discusses the uses of the program in both the design and analysis of <b>engine</b> <b>inlets,</b> with several examples given for VTOL lift fans, acoustic splitters, and for STOL engine nacelles. Several test support applications are also given...|$|R
50|$|All {{parts of}} the {{aircraft}} created reflections—the fuselage, tail, wings, <b>engine</b> <b>inlets</b> and exhaust. The anti-radar techniques investigated fell into two categories, either absorbing the radar energy or creating reflections that interfered with the reflections from the aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|Production {{aircraft}} were {{powered by}} {{an arrangement of}} four Avon 201 turbojet engines, each capable of generating 9,500 lbf (42 kN) of thrust. In addition to being the aircraft's primary source of propulsion, the engines also provided bleed air for the pressurization, ice protection, and air conditioning systems {{as well as the}} aircraft's assorted electrical generators. Napier Spraymat electric heaters were present within the <b>engine</b> <b>inlets</b> as a de-icing measure. The shape of the <b>engine</b> <b>inlets</b> were long rectangular slots in the first prototype, while the production Valiants featured oval or [...] "spectacle" [...] shaped inlets to permit greater airflow for the more powerful engines that were installed. The jet exhausts emerged from fairings above the trailing edge of the wings.|$|R
25|$|The two 117 engines {{incorporate}} thrust vectoring (TVC) nozzles whose rotational axes {{are each}} canted at an angle, {{similar to the}} nozzle arrangement of the Su-35S. This configuration allows the aircraft to produce thrust vectoring moments about all three rotational axes, pitch, yaw and roll. Thrust vectoring nozzles themselves operate in only one plane; the canting allows the aircraft to produce both roll and yaw by vectoring each engine nozzle differently. The <b>engine</b> <b>inlet</b> incorporates variable intake ramps for increased supersonic efficiency and retractable mesh screens to prevent foreign object debris being ingested that would cause engine damage. The 117 engine is to also incorporate infrared and RCS reduction measures. In 2014, the Indian Air Force openly expressed concerns over the reliability and performance of the 117 engines; during the 2011 Moscow Air Show, a T-50 suffered a compressor stall that forced the aircraft to abort takeoff.|$|E
500|$|As F-111 {{development}} continued, stall issues {{arose in}} certain parts of the flight regime; these were addressed by modifying the <b>engine</b> <b>inlet</b> in 1965–66, ending with the [...] "Triple Plow I" [...] and [...] "Triple Plow II" [...] designs. The F-111B was cancelled by the Navy in 1968 due to weight and performance deficiencies. The improved F-111E, F-111D, F-111F models were subsequently developed for the USAF. The FB-111A strategic bomber and the EF-111 electronic warfare versions were also later developed for the USAF. Production ended in 1976, with a total of 563 F-111s of all variants built, well below the prediction of 1,500.|$|E
500|$|While superficially {{similar to}} the later F-117, the Have Blue prototypes were smaller aircraft, about one quarter {{the weight of the}} F-117, with a wing sweep of 72.5° and inward-canted {{vertical}} tails (inverse V-tail). Radar-absorbent material (RAM), developed in a Lockheed laboratory, were applied to the aircraft's flat surfaces – for the windscreen, special coatings were applied to give them metallic characteristics. The aircraft's gross weight of 9,200–12,500lb (4,173–5,669kg) enabled the aircraft to use the landing gear from the Northrop F-5 fighter. The aircraft's powerplants were two [...] General Electric J85-GE-4As of the T-2C Buckeye. Because stealth took precedence above all else, the aircraft was inherently unstable. As a result, a quadruple redundant fly-by-wire (FBW) flight control system was integrated into the aircraft to give it normal flying characteristics. The flight control system was borrowed from the F-16. The overwing <b>engine</b> <b>inlet</b> was covered by a low-RCS grid; during takeoffs, when more air is needed, blow-in doors were constructed at the upper fuselage to admit additional airflow.|$|E
50|$|Ice {{accumulation}} on {{the leading}} edge (lip) of <b>engine</b> <b>inlets</b> causes flow problems and can lead to ice ingestion. In turbofan engines, laminar airflow is required at the face of the fan. Because of this, most engine ice protection systems are anti-ice systems (prevent build up).|$|R
40|$|Improved {{eddy-current}} electromagnetic-repulsion deicing systems {{developed for}} use on variety of exterior aircraft surfaces like leading edges of wings, <b>engine</b> <b>inlets,</b> propellers, and helicopter rotors. Fit to exterior surfaces, as retrofits or original equipment. Systems light in weight, consume little average power, and capable of protecting against severe icing conditions...|$|R
25|$|Most {{in-flight}} shutdowns are harmless {{and likely}} to go unnoticed by passengers. For example, it may be prudent for the flight crew to shut down an engine and perform a precautionary landing {{in the event of}} a low oil pressure or high oil temperature warning in the cockpit. However, passengers in a jet powered aircraft may become quite alarmed by other engine events such as a compressor surge — a malfunction that is typified by loud bangs and even flames from the <b>engine’s</b> <b>inlet</b> and tailpipe. A compressor surge is a disruption of the airflow through a gas turbine jet engine that can be caused by engine deterioration, a crosswind over the <b>engine’s</b> <b>inlet,</b> ingestion of foreign material, or an internal component failure such as a broken blade. While this situation can be alarming, the engine may recover with no damage.|$|R
2500|$|Initially {{there were}} {{compressor}} surge and stall issues {{in certain parts}} of the flight regime. NASA, the Air Force, and General Dynamics studies resulted in the <b>engine</b> <b>inlet</b> design being modified in 1965-66, ending with the [...] "Triple Plow I" [...] and [...] "Triple Plow II" [...] designs.|$|E
2500|$|Lacking {{experience}} with carrier-based fighters, General Dynamics teamed with Grumman for assembly and {{test of the}} F-111B aircraft. In addition, Grumman would also build the F-111A's aft fuselage and the landing gear. The first test F-111A was powered by YTF30-P-1 turbofans and used a set of ejector seats, since the escape capsule was not yet available. It first flew on 21 December 1964. The first F-111B was also equipped with ejector seats and first flew on 18 May 1965. To address stall issues {{in certain parts of}} the flight regime, the F-111's <b>engine</b> <b>inlet</b> design was modified in 1965–66, ending with the [...] "Triple Plow I" [...] and [...] "Triple Plow II" [...] designs. The F-111A achieved a speed of Mach1.3 in February 1965 with an interim intake design.|$|E
5000|$|The left <b>engine</b> <b>inlet</b> {{separated}} from the engine during the flight. Debris from the <b>engine</b> <b>inlet</b> damaged the airplane fuselage, wing and empennage.|$|E
50|$|The forward wing's {{angle of}} {{incidence}} is slightly {{greater than that of}} the main wing, so that it stalls before the main wing, producing an automatic nose-down effect prior to the onset of main wing stall; its five-degree anhedral (negative dihedral) keeps the stream wash interference clear of the <b>engine</b> <b>inlets,</b> the main wing and the tailplane.|$|R
50|$|Variable {{valve timing}} (VVT) {{is a system}} for varying the valve opening of an {{internal}} combustion engine. This allows the engine to deliver high power, but also to work tractably and efficiently at low power. There are many systems for VVT, which involve changing either the relative timing, duration or opening of the <b>engine's</b> <b>inlet</b> and exhaust valves.|$|R
40|$|The report {{describes}} {{progress in}} research directed towards the efficient {{solution of the}} inviscid Euler and Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations for transonic flows through <b>engine</b> <b>inlets,</b> and past complete aircraft configurations, with emphasis on the flowfields {{in the vicinity of}} <b>engine</b> <b>inlets.</b> The research focusses upon the development of solution-adaptive grid procedures for these problems, and the development of multi-grid algorithms in conjunction with both, implicit and explicit time-stepping schemes for the solution of three-dimensional problems. The work includes further development of mesh systems suitable for inlet and wing-fuselage-inlet geometries using a variational approach. Work during this reporting period concentrated upon two-dimensional problems, and has been in two general areas: (1) the development of solution-adaptive procedures to cluster the grid cells in regions of high (truncation) error;and (2) the development of a multigrid scheme for solution of the two-dimensional Euler equations using a diagonalized alternating direction implicit (ADI) smoothing algorithm...|$|R

This is the only version of the Centaur known to have seen combat, in service with the Royal Marines Armoured Support Group. The vehicles were fitted with wading gear to get them ashore. Trunking waterproofed the <b>engine</b> <b>inlets</b> and covers were fitted to the guns. 114 produced.|$|R
5000|$|Multiair is a {{hydraulically}} actuated {{variable valve}} timing (VVT) engine technology enabling [...] "cylinder by cylinder, stroke by stroke" [...] control of intake air directly via a gasoline <b>engine's</b> <b>inlet</b> valves. Developed by Fiat Powertrain Technologies, the technology bypasses a primary engine inefficiency: pumping losses caused by restriction of the intake passage by the throttle plate, used to regulate air feeding the cylinders.|$|R
5000|$|A {{bleed air}} {{system is the}} method used by most larger jet {{aircraft}} to keep flight surfaces above the freezing temperature required for ice to accumulate (called anti-icing).

50|$|Long Arrow (Chang-Jian or Changjian, 长箭, often {{abbreviated}} as CJ) is a fixed wing, jet powered UAV {{developed by}} NUAA developed in 2006. During {{the development of}} Long Arrow UAV, computer aided design was widely used. More importantly, most of the computer programs were indigenously developed by NUAA. The <b>engine</b> <b>inlet</b> of Long Arrow was completely designed via CAD, which reduced cost and time.The <b>engine</b> <b>inlet</b> is constructed fiber glass plastic that helped reduced radar cross section and thus improved stealth.|$|E
50|$|Many modern civil {{fixed-wing}} {{transport aircraft}} use anti-ice systems {{on the leading}} edge of wings, <b>engine</b> <b>inlets</b> and air data probes using warm air. This is bled from engines and is ducted into a cavity beneath the surface to be anti-iced. The warm air heats the surface up to a few degrees above 0 °C (32 °F), preventing ice from forming. The system may operate autonomously, switching on and off as the aircraft enters and leaves icing conditions.|$|R

Developed by Fiat Powertrain Technologies, the technology bypasses a primary engine inefficiency: pumping losses caused by restriction of the intake passage by the throttle plate, used to regulate air feeding the cylinders. Multiair was licensed to the Schaeffler Group in 2001, which also markets the system as Uniair.|$|R
50|$|Like the 707, the 720/720B used {{engine-driven}} turbocompressors {{to supply}} high-pressure air for cabin pressurization. The engines could not supply sufficient bleed air {{for this purpose}} without a serious loss of thrust. The small air inlets and associated humps are visible just above the main <b>engine</b> <b>inlets</b> on the two inner engine pods of all 720s and 720Bs; the lack of the turbocompressor inlet on the outer starboard pod (number 4 engine) helps spotters distinguish 720/720Bs from most 707s, which had three turbocompressors.|$|R
