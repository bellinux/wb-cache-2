40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this article is to discuss the results from a UK {{government-funded}} applied research programme on value chain analysis that examined the beef foodservice sector. The demands and dynamics of this sector differ markedly from those of the supermarket, which is the dominant channel for beef produce and which forms the focus of the existing literature. This is a challenging environment for the application of collaborative supply chain improvement principles because of its high level of regulatory control, power relationships and low profit margins. Design/methodology/approach – This is an applied research project that was case study based and employed the value chain analysis method. Empirical work was conducted over an 11 -month period and included a one-week whole-team study tour to Argentina. Informants encompassed UK and Argentine livestock producers, an Argentine meat processor, a UK meat <b>import</b> <b>operation,</b> a UK meat processor, a UK foodservice distribution centre and two foodservice restaurants. Findings – The paper concentrates on the key findings pertinent to the upstream members of the above chain. It highlights specific supply chain waste elimination opportunities at both producer and processor level. It also establishes valuable learning points for the UK beef industry as a whole. Originality/value – This study represents the first holistic and non-partisan study of its type within the UK beef industry. This paper adds to the limited body of knowledge on supply chain management within the foodservice sector. It also provides the first explanation and analysis of its kind on supply chain operations within the Argentine beef industry. It quantifies the magnitude and nature of the cost advantage afforded the Argentine producer over its best practice counterpart. Finally, it presents a number of reflections upon the implications of this study for the concept of best practice and also the Lean paradigm...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} Indian foreign trade policy on its economic development. Examining {{the evolution of the}} Indian foreign trade since the 1990 s, it is found out that trade reforms in India have had a strong positive impact on total economic growth. The analysis suggests that India should stimulate high effective and export oriented production by technological up-gradation of industry. The overall finding is that while industrial labor productivity has had major positive effects on efficiency in Indian manufacturing, they may not have had similar positive effects on provision of permanent export growth. Key words: economic development, manufacture sector, trade policy, labor productivity, special economic zones, R&D, GDP, export and <b>import</b> <b>operations...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{current period}} of globalization, still greater {{liberalization}} of business environment and growing competition put companies {{in a difficult}} situation. To succeed, they are expanding business to an international environment. Multinational companies are expanding into the markets, where they {{do not yet have}} their own effects. Entrepreneur or company can use several forms of entry, from export and <b>import</b> <b>operations,</b> through capital-saving forms of market presence, for example licensing, franchising or industrial cooperation, to capital inputs, that can be realized through portfolio or foreign direct investment. On the one hand, entrepreneur's interest to invest is affected by the economic situation of the country, but the effects of using ICT are crucial as well. One of these factors is the high-speed mobile internet access. Mobile network operators can meet demand due to holding of specific frequencies in different bands. Nowadays, the Czech Republic has initiated new selection procedure [...] auction to divide frequencies. This Auction is used to attract new mobile operators and also offer new forms of entry for them. Mobile operators need to grant permits, licenses to operate different networks. Significantly for them is entering through strategic alliances of large companies, since it is the area of telecommunications, which requires {{a lot of money on}} research and development, innovation and development of telecommunications infrastructure. The first part presents different types of expansion from export and <b>import</b> <b>operations</b> through capital-saving investments to the most complex capital inputs. The second part focuses on the current mobile service providers operating on the Czech market, and their entry into the Czech Republic. The third and last part presents a new selection procedure [...] an auction to obtain radio frequencies. There are outlined some new possibilities of entering mobile network operators on the Czech market with telecommunication, which brings this auction...|$|R

40|$|Financing (funding) is {{essentially}} the purchase of funds necessary for a business. This can be done from internal sources (company’s own funds) or external (borrowed funds).

Thus, it is frequent to resort to borrowed funds. In International Business Transactions, external financing is done both by classical techniques of credit (credit supplier and buyer credit) and modern techniques of financing (factoring, forfeiting, leasing) all trade tailored.

40|$|This paper {{argues for}} a more actor-centred {{approach}} in freight transportation studies, one that includes freight shippers and public authorities, as well as carriers, and that pays {{close attention to the}} relationships between these actors. One advantage of this approach is that it focuses on the conditions under which global logistics flows may become relatively fixed in particular localities. The perspective is illustrated through a discussion of the geography of port usage by importers of automobiles to the US since 1980. The need to secure space at or near marine terminals for vehicle processing activities is a driving factor in port selection. While the overall trade in automobiles has not become concentrated in fewer ports over the last 20 years, individual firms are concentrating the bulk of their <b>import</b> <b>operations</b> in fewer ports. This "mutual specialisation" involves a process of interpenetration between actors that is only visible in a disaggregated analysis.

40|$|Logistics service {{providers}} (LSPs) often {{face the challenge}} of uncertainty in air <b>import</b> <b>operations.</b> Due to the limited capacity of aircraft, the problem of cargo offload occurs frequently. Without prior notice, cargoes are delivered in separate flights, which increase handling complexity. On the other hand, due to the short transit time between flights, the shipper at the origin does not have sufficient time to inform the LSPs the details of cargo being loaded before its arrival. This results in a lack of time for LSPs to assign storage location for the arrived cargo at the distribution center (DC). Hence, the order picking process becomes inefficient and time-consuming, which leads to trucks idling in the docking area waiting for the consolidated goods. The problems become more obvious when handling electronic components and high tech products. In this study, a hybrid RFID case-based decision support system, integrating RFID and case-based reasoning technologies, is proposed for handling air cargo storage location assignment operations in distribution centers. After pilot study of the proposed system in a third-party LSP, the order-picking efficiency is improved while the truck idling time at the docking area is reduced significantly.

40|$|Outward {{operations}} such as {{exports and}} foreign investment have received {{most of the}} attention in international business research, but the internationalisation of businesses also includes activities that are inwardly oriented. Inward activities like purchase of machinery and equipment, and procurement of raw materials and semi-finished goods provide many opportunities for learning about international business and for building relations with foreign actors. Often such activities – directly or indirectly – also lead to the opening-up of outward operation possibilities for companies. Recent research shows that for many firms international operations have evolved via various forms of inward activities, especially since such activities help develop a range of potential links through which information relevant to outward operations might be transferred. This paper presents a case study of the Norwegian company Moelven and its operations in the Russian market. Moelven’s experience shows that inward operations should, at least, be considered as ways to initial entry and early development of a foreign market.
