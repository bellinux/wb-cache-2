Many motive, stylistic features, technical solutions appeared in all of the media and for Orosz it seemingly did not cause any problem to cross the borders of the different genres. When he was drawing a poster usually he did it with the preciseness of illustrators, when he was illustrating a book, he did it with the narrative mood of filmmakers, if he was animating films, sometimes he used the several layers approach of etchers and engravers and for prints he often chose the emblematic simplifying way of depiction of posters. If we call him only a poster designer based on his functional prints, we narrow down his <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity,</b> we go closer to the truth if we associate him with „postering" [...] as a way of thinking, or if we call his many sided image depicting ourselves and our age as the poster-mirror of István Orosz.

Related tasks and especially the organizational environment in which IT project portfolio management is embedded are often excluded. This paper relates existing findings from the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> IT governance to the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> IT project portfolio management. Based on a qualitative study, different <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> in IT project portfolio management are identified. Furthermore, governance issues in IT project portfolio management are illustrated and a category schema for the assessment of governance structures in the different <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> is introduced. In contrast to existing publications in this <b>field</b> <b>of</b> research, which usually employ a maturity level perspective, the paper focuses on {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} centralized, decentralized and federal structures in different <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> <b>of</b> IT project portfolio management.
