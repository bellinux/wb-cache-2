5|$|Clare and Henry marry, but Clare {{has trouble}} {{bringing}} a pregnancy to term {{because of the}} <b>genetic</b> <b>anomaly</b> Henry may presumably be passing on to the fetus. After six miscarriages, Henry wishes to save Clare further pain and has a vasectomy. However a version of Henry from the past visits Clare one night and they make love; she subsequently gives birth to a daughter, Alba. Alba is diagnosed with Chrono-Impairment as well but, unlike Henry, she has some control over her destinations when she time travels. Before she is born, Henry travels to the future and meets his ten-year-old daughter on a school field trip and learns that he dies when she is five years old.|$|E
5|$|On February 16, 2013, at age 37, Jolie {{underwent}} a preventive double mastectomy after learning {{she had an}} 87% risk of developing breast cancer due to a defective BRCA1 gene. Her maternal family history warranted genetic testing for BRCA mutations: her mother, actress Marcheline Bertrand, had breast cancer and died from ovarian cancer, while her grandmother died from ovarian cancer. Her aunt, who had the same BRCA1 defect, died from breast cancer three months after Jolie's operation. Following the mastectomy, which lowered her chances of developing breast cancer to under 5 percent, Jolie had reconstructive surgery involving implants and allografts. Two years later, in March 2015, after annual test results indicated possible signs of early ovarian cancer, she {{underwent a}} preventive oophorectomy, as she had a 50% risk of developing ovarian cancer due to the same <b>genetic</b> <b>anomaly.</b> Despite hormone replacement therapy, the surgery brought on premature menopause.|$|E

50|$|Dr. B.D. Hall first {{described}} the CHARGE association in a 1979 journal paper of about 17 {{children who had}} been born with choanal atresia. During the same year, Dr. H.M. Hittner described 10 children who had choanal atresia as well as coloboma, congenital heart defect, and hearing loss. Using both coloboma or choanal atresia {{and some of the other}} related characteristic malformations, Dr. R. A. Pagon first coined the acronym CHARGE in 1981 to emphasize that this cluster of associated malformations occurred together. It came to be recognised as a syndrome within the umbrella of the CHARGE association, a set of apparently random signs occurring together. Since the signs seen in CHARGE are caused by a <b>genetic</b> <b>anomaly,</b> its name was eventually changed to 'CHARGE syndrome'.|$|E

40|$|Nick {{translation}} {{is used to}} label DNA and RNA to produce probes for in situ hybridization and Northern and Southern blotting. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a widely applied technique used to determine chromosomal and <b>genetic</b> <b>anomalies</b> in many biological samples. Initially the technique was applied to metaphase preparations, but the usefulness of detecting <b>genetic</b> <b>anomalies</b> in solid tumors in situ {{has resulted in the}} development of modified protocols. Formalin fixed paraffin processed tissue sections present novel challenges when applying FISH; the probes must be small (between 200 and 600 base pairs) and pretreatment is necessary before the probes can be applied to tissue sections, to promote probe access to target DNA. Here we report on a modification of a nick translation method to produce a probe that can reliably be used with FISH in paraffin processed tissue sections...|$|R
50|$|Brendan Fraser and Keri Russell play John Crowley and his wife, Aileen, a Portland {{couple with}} two of their three {{children}} suffering from Pompe disease, a <b>genetic</b> <b>anomaly</b> that typically kills most before a child's tenth birthday. John, an advertising executive, contacts Robert Stonehill (Harrison Ford), a researcher in Nebraska who has done innovative research for an enzyme treatment for the rare disease. John and Aileen raise money to help Stonehill's research and the required clinical trials. John takes on the task full-time to save his children's lives, launching a biotechnology research company working with venture capitalists and then rival teams of researchers. This task proves very daunting for Stonehill, who already works around the clock. As time is running short, Stonehill's angry outburst hinders the company's faith in him, and the profit motive may upend John's hopes. The researchers race against time to save the children who have the disease.|$|E

50|$|Early {{attempts}} to create alien-human hybrids were pioneered by German and Japanese scientists shortly after World War II, {{and for some}} time during the Cold War. However, these often met with failure, and the Syndicate started to rely more on their own scientists. According to the Alien Bounty Hunter, in the 1950s, Soviet geneticists found a unique <b>genetic</b> <b>anomaly</b> within identical twins. The Colonists and Syndicate scientists used this to eventually develop human clones with alien elements and partial hybrids, {{but they were still}} ultimately inferior. Hybrids of this type include Samantha Mulder, Kurt Crawford, the Gregors, Ernest Calderon, and Dr. William Secare. Child and adult versions of Samantha and Kurt are also seen. These clones have the same caustic greenish blood of the aliens, have greater muscular strength and higher physical endurance levels than most normal humans, and can breathe underwater. In addition to their intended use by the alien colonists, the Syndicate is occasionally seen using these clones to perform various tasks, such as research and physical labor.|$|E

50|$|These {{circumstances}} are a contrast between a vernacular and language variant {{used by the}} same speakers. According to one school of linguistic thought, all such variants are examples of a linguistic phenomenon termed diglossia ("split tongue", {{on the model of}} the <b>genetic</b> <b>anomaly).</b> In it, the language is bifurcated, i.e. the speaker learns two forms of the language and ordinarily uses one but under special circumstances the other. The one most frequently used is the low (L) variant, equivalent to the vernacular, while the special variant is the high (H). The concept was introduced to linguistics by Charles A. Ferguson (1959), but Ferguson explicitly excluded variants as divergent as dialects or different languages or as similar as styles or registers. H must not be a conversational form; Ferguson had in mind a literary language. For example, a lecture is delivered in a different variety than ordinary conversation. Ferguson's own example was classical and spoken Arabic, but the analogy between Vulgar Latin and Classical Latin is of the same type. Excluding the upper-class and lower-class register aspects of the two variants, Classical Latin was a literary language; the people spoke Vulgar Latin as a vernacular.|$|E

In this story, he is a xenobiologist {{who came to}} Earth to {{investigate}} a <b>genetic</b> <b>anomaly,</b> {{pretending to be a}} human named Philip Lawson but ended up intrigued by humanity (and implicitly in love with Carol Danvers). When a Kree robot came to evaluate Earth's threat to the Kree, he sacrificed his false identity to save Carol, Wasp and Ant-Man, and in so doing accidentally duplicated some Kree powers to Carol. He assisted the Avengers in destroying the robot, nearly dying in the process, and left for the Kree homeworld to bargain on humanity's behalf. He was not successful, since the Kree later invaded, and Mar-Vell begged the Avengers to peacefully surrender, believing it to be Earth's only hope for survival. He was imprisoned along with Ronan the Accuser in Prison 42. Later he accompanied the Avengers to the Kree Empire in a last-ditch effort to intervene on humanity's behalf. After the shut down of the Supreme Intelligence, he became the new Kree leader.|$|E
50|$|What is {{the origin}} of these changes? In earlier work Crow {{considered}} but was able to rule out a viral causation. There is a genetic component but its nature has been obscure. Crow {{is known for his}} suggestion that schizophrenia is a widespread <b>genetic</b> <b>anomaly</b> which arose quite recently in human evolution. He believes that it arose with the evolution of language and that the two are linked. In his argument, he says that schizophrenia is associated with atypical patterns of lateralisation - which is the differential functioning of the left and right cerebral hemispheres. He argues that through studying epigenetic variation, we can look at the changes in human evolution and see where the alterations in our genes have occurred, that lead to language development and henceforth schizophrenia. Crow reported that lateralisation occurs greater in males, who undergo more severe psychosis. Crowâ€™s particular recent contribution has been the proposal that the origins of the psychoses relate particularly to those characteristics (e.g. cerebral asymmetry) that are associated with the specifically human capacity for language. This leads to a theory of {{the origin of}} psychotic symptoms - that they are associated with deviations in the subtle asymmetries of development of the cortex, and that the symptoms arise as confusions between thought and speech and through the abnormal attachment of meaning to perceived speech - and to its genetic basis in the change that led to the evolution of Homo sapiens as a species.|$|E
