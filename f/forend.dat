5|$|Weapons used by {{the space}} marines were based on fully {{functional}} weapons. British armorers used guns they {{found to be the}} most reliable when firing blanks and those which looked futuristic. The 'pulse rifles' were created from a Thompson SMG, with an attached <b>forend</b> of a Franchi SPAS-12 shotgun and a Remington 12 Gauge Model 870P receiver with barrel. The 'smart guns' carried by Vasquez and Drake were based on the German MG-42 machine gun and were maneuvered with Steadicam-like harnesses created using old motorcycle parts. The crew found flamethrowers the most difficult weapon to create and use, as they were the heaviest and most dangerous.|$|E
25|$|The wood {{stocks and}} <b>forend</b> are made {{specifically}} for Thompson Center by a sawmill in Kansas.|$|E
25|$|It {{had a full}} pistol-gripped in-line {{stock to}} control recoil, a plastic upper <b>forend</b> to save weight, a muzzle compensator, the BAR sling, an M2 bipod, and a folding metal {{vertical}} foregrip mounted under the <b>forend</b> of the stock. Although an improvement over the M14 when in full-auto, it was still difficult to control, overheated rapidly, and the 20-round magazine limited its ability to deliver suppressive fire.|$|E
5000|$|The gun is {{available}} in 20 gauge and 28 gauge. It uses a patented action that John Browning developed for the Browning Auto-5. Rounds are cycled through long recoil. Factory models are equipped with walnut stocks and <b>forends.</b> Franchi offers one model with a short stock, and one model with a “Prince-of-Wales” stock.|$|R
5000|$|Rail Mounted Fixed Loop (RMFL) {{allows for}} a sling {{mounting}} loop on the railed <b>forends</b> on MilSpec 1913 hand guard rails. It is issued on the USMC M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle, and is also approved for use with the M4, M4A1, and M16A4. With a NSN: 1005-01-589-7062 and NIIN: 01-589-7062 (As issued with the M27).|$|R
50|$|Surefire {{produces}} Picatinny rail <b>forends,</b> sound suppressors, muzzle brakes, flash suppressors, EarPro branded {{hearing protection}} and tactical communication earpieces, and Combat Utility knives. These knives combine some {{features of a}} multi-tool with the blade of a combat knife. In late 2010, Surefire introduced STANAG compatible high capacity magazines with a capacity of 60 or 100 rounds.|$|R
25|$|The 1928 Thompson {{would be}} the last small arm adopted by the U.S. Army that used a year {{designation}} in the official nomenclature. With the start of World War II, major contracts from several countries saved the manufacturer from bankruptcy. A notable variant of the Model 1928 with an aluminum receiver and tenite grip, buttstock, and <b>forend,</b> was made by Savage.|$|E
25|$|The M1928A1 variant entered mass {{production}} {{before the attack}} on Pearl Harbor, as on-hand stocks ran out. Changes included a horizontal <b>forend,</b> {{in place of the}} distinctive vertical foregrip ("pistol grip"), and a provision for a military sling. Despite new U.S. contracts for Lend-Lease shipments abroad to China, France, and the United Kingdom, as well as the needs of American armed forces, only two factories supplied M1928A1 Thompsons {{during the early years of}} World War II. Though it could use both the 50-round drum and the 20- or 30-round box magazines, active service showed the drums were more prone to jamming, rattled when moving, and were too heavy and bulky on long patrols. 562,511 were made. Wartime production variants had a fixed rear sight without the triangular sight guard wings and a non-ribbed barrel, both like those found on the M1/M1A1.|$|E
500|$|The Winchester Model 1897 and the Winchester Model 1893 {{were both}} {{designed}} by John Browning. The Model 1897 is an external hammer shotgun lacking a trigger disconnector. This {{means that the}} user can hold the trigger down while cycling the shotgun and once the action is returned to battery the shotgun fires. The firearm itself is classified as a slide action pump shotgun. It was the first truly successful pump-action shotgun produced. Throughout the time period the Model 1897 was in production, over a million of the type were produced in various grades and barrel lengths. 16-gauge guns had a standard barrel length of 28inches, while 12-gauge guns were furnished with 30-inch length barrels. Special length barrels could be ordered in lengths as short as 20inches, {{and as long as}} 36inches. Along with various grades and barrel lengths, the Model 1897 came in two different chamberings. One was the 12 gauge and the other was the 16 gauge. The shells should be of the [...] inch or [...] inch model. Any shells larger are not recommended. An average Model 1897 can hold 5 shotgun shells in the magazine tube. However, this could vary from grade to grade. When working the action of the Model 1897 the <b>forend</b> (fore grip) is pulled back, forcing the breech bolt to the rear which extracts and then ejects the spent shell while simultaneously cocking the external hammer by pushing it to the rear. When the <b>forend</b> is slid forward again, the breech bolt pushes a fresh shell into the gun's chamber and locks into place.|$|E
50|$|Varmint rifles can {{typically}} {{be distinguished}} from other light-caliber hunting or plinking rifles {{in the use of}} heavier barrels and (often) omission of open sights. Use of magnifying optics allows for more accurate fire (often on very small, distant moving targets). Barrels will generally be free-floated, and other accurizing techniques will be performed, either by the manufacturer or the owner. The stocks will generally have wider <b>forends,</b> designed for use on stable sandbag rests, and high combs for easy use with optics.|$|R
5000|$|The Sako TRG M10 Sniper Weapon System was {{unveiled}} by Sako in October 2011. It {{was designed as}} a user configurable multi caliber modular system and does not share its receiver and other technical features with the Sako TRG line. It can switch between [...]308 Winchester or 7.62×51mm NATO, [...]300 Winchester Magnum and [...]338 Lapua Magnum chamberings by changing the bolts, magazines, <b>forends</b> and barrels, to adapt to various requirements in the field. When it was first introduced, it was marketed for [...] "military and law enforcement only".|$|R
2500|$|Configurations of grips {{and stocks}} for riot {{shotguns}} vary widely, but often feature reinforced plastic [...] "furniture" [...] {{instead of the}} wood common on hunting firearms. Wood was used for riot gun stocks in the past, and sometimes still is. As compared to hunting shotguns, riot guns more often feature pistol grips, {{with or without a}} shoulder stock. Without a shoulder stock (or with a folding stock), a riot shotgun becomes more compact and thus is able to be brought to bear more rapidly in very close quarters. With the stock, the pistol grip facilitates control of the weapon and provides a more ergonomic grip when the shotgun is fired from the shoulder. Foregrips, or <b>forends,</b> also vary, often with the inclusion of a pistol-grip fore-end (further increasing control and absorbing recoil), and/or the addition of an accessory rail or other mounting point for a tactical light.|$|R
2500|$|One of the {{experimental}} ideas {{was the creation of}} a pistol-carbine for use by light cavalry. They had a [...] "slab-sided" [...] receiver, standard 10-round magazine, a permanently affixed wooden stock and <b>forend,</b> and a lengthened [...] (early production) or [...] (late production) barrel. They were dropped from production after 1899 due to poor sales and little military interest.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{member of}} the SG 550 family is the SG 550 Sniper variant (also {{designated}} SG 550-1) designed specifically for Swiss security forces. This accurized rifle has a refined two-stage trigger (the pull force was reduced from [...] to , a heavy, hammer-forged [...] long barrel with a 254mm (1:10 in) rifling twist rate (it has no flash hider) and is used exclusively with telescopic sights. The new folding stock has an adjustable cheek piece and a spacer system on the butt, the ergonomic pistol grip's angle of inclination can be regulated, the <b>forend</b> was shortened, and the bipod features a height and cant adjustment mechanism. This model {{is no longer in}} production.|$|E
2500|$|G36K (K—kurz [...] "short"): carbine variant with {{a shorter}} barrel (fitted with an open-type flash suppressor) and a shorter <b>forend,</b> which {{includes}} a bottom rail {{that can be used}} to attach tactical accessories, such as a UTL flashlight from the USP pistol. The carbine's barrel lacks the ability to launch rifle grenades and it will not support a bayonet. The weapon retained the ability to be used with the AG36 grenade launcher. G36Ks in service with German special forces are issued with a 100-round C-Mag drum. There are two variants of the G36K. The first and most commonly known has x3 scope/carry handle attached to the top, while the second is equipped with iron sights and a rail (no scope included).|$|E
5000|$|Browning Citoris {{come in all}} of {{the popular}} shotgun shell gauges, and are made in an over-under [...] "stacked" [...] barrel configuration, with <b>forends</b> and buttstocks made from high quality walnut wood. Barrel lengths can be {{purchased}} from 26 inches for skeet shooting to 32 inches for sporting clays and trap shooting. The top barrel has a vented rib attached by soldering for {{the entire length of the}} barrel tube. Newer Citori internal barrels are chrome-lined for added surface strength. All metal parts are bright blued for the standard model. [...] "In-the-white" [...] higher grade models with more elaborate machine-applied engraving can also be purchased. Rubber recoil butt pads (12 gauge) or plastic butt plates (sub-gauges) are standard. Citori actions are made with internal hammers and coil springs and all Citori models have shell ejectors, which expel spent shells when the breech is opened by pressing aside the top lever and bending the action fully open, which also re-cocks the internal hammers.|$|R
50|$|Weapon-mounted lights {{used to be}} {{specific}} to particular models of firearm, {{and to some extent}} that is still true; for example, SureFire makes dedicated lights that replace the <b>forends</b> of the Mossberg 500 and Benelli M3 shotguns, the Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine gun, and the M4 carbine. On the other hand, many modern firearms are incorporating Picatinny rail systems, allowing any appropriately sized Picatinny compatible system to be attached. Other mounting systems are simple clamps, designed to mount most cylindrical lights parallel to the barrel of most firearms. Using an infrared light in conjunction with night vision goggles can mitigate concern about revealing the user, so long as the target lacks night vision. Also partially mitigating this risk associated with a visible light tactical light is the ability of the tactical light user to temporarily disrupt the night vision of the target.For Police S.W.A.T. use, long-range weapon lights with exceptional range have always been a problem. Tactical weapon lighting companies such as ExtremeBeam for example have created small light duty lights which S.W.A.T. officers are able to mount to their modern weapons giving them an extended range out to beyond 300 meters (325+yards). This has allowed officer to blind suspects and protect officers closer at hand from being detected and thereby allowing for a better resolution of the situation with less lethal force.|$|R
2500|$|The SMLE {{design was}} a {{relatively}} expensive long arm to manufacture, because of the many forging and machining operations required. In the 1920s, a series of experiments resulting in design changes were carried out to help with these problems, {{reducing the number of}} complex parts and refining manufacturing processes. The SMLE Mk V (later Rifle No. 1 Mk V), adopted a new receiver-mounted aperture sighting system, which moved the rear sight from its former position on the barrel. The increased gap resulted in an improved sighting radius, improving sighting accuracy and the aperture improved speed of sighting over various distances. In the stowed position, a fixed distance aperture battle sight calibrated for [...] protruded saving further precious seconds when laying the sight to a target. An alternative developed during this period was to be used on the No. 4 variant, a [...] "battle sight" [...] was developed that allowed for two set distances of 300 yards and 600 yards to be quickly deployed and was cheaper to produce than the [...] "ladder sight". The magazine cutoff was also reintroduced and an additional band was added near the muzzle for additional strength during bayonet use. The design was found to be even more complicated and expensive to manufacture than the Mk III and was not developed or issued, beyond a trial production of about 20,000 rifles between 1922 and 1924 at RSAF Enfield. The No. 1 Mk VI also introduced a heavier [...] "floating barrel" [...] that was independent of the forearm, allowing the barrel to expand and contract without contacting the forearm and interfering with the 'zero', the correlation between the alignment of the barrel and the sights. The floating barrel increased the accuracy of the rifle by allowing it to vibrate freely and consistently, whereas wooden <b>forends</b> in contact with barrels, if not properly fitted, affected the harmonic vibrations of the barrel. The receiver-mounted rear sights and magazine cutoff were also present and 1,025 units were produced between 1930 and 1933.|$|R
2500|$|There {{are many}} {{variants}} of this rifle offered for sale. The first variant was sold with an aluminum Picatinny rail {{on the upper}} receiver {{and a series of}} plastic rails on the handguard. The market pushed SIG to produce the rifle with the slimmer profile 551-type handguards and a hooded front sight; this version is marketed as the SIG556 Classic. Several folding stock models have been released as well as variants with railed <b>forend</b> combinations. Another major variant is a SIG556 DMR. This features a [...] long barrel without flash suppressor, upgraded, a match type trigger, Magpul PRS stock and older style plastic handguards. SIGP556 pistol variants with 10 in barrels are also available. In 2012 the SIG556R or SIG556 Russian chambered for the 7.62×39mm cartridge and using AK-pattern box magazines was introduced. The first generation of SIG556R rifles had a number of performance issues that were later resolved in later production runs of the SIG556R.|$|E
50|$|Rifles {{found with}} this {{instead of the}} usual {{markings}} are believed to have been assembled from parts after the company went bankrupt in 1879. These were mostly 30” round barrel military muskets which had a short <b>forend</b> attached with a screw. This <b>forend</b> {{is quite different from the}} usual sporting <b>forend.</b>|$|E
50|$|They are {{equipped}} with Police-specific walnut or synthetic stocks which are fitted with sling mounts. Walnut stocks lack checkering as found on the Express/Wingmaster models. 870P models come with matching walnut or synthetic forends that are shortened to prevent interference with most vehicle-mounted rack systems. The shortened <b>forend</b> also allows quick visual inspection of the magazine regardless of what position the <b>forend</b> is in, whereas the lengthened sport-type <b>forend</b> on other models partially blocks the loading port when pulled to the rear.|$|E
50|$|A pump-action or slide-action firearm is one {{in which}} a <b>forend</b> can be moved forward and {{backward}} in order to eject a spent round of ammunition and to chamber a fresh one. It is much faster than a bolt-action and somewhat faster than a lever-action, as it does not require the trigger hand to be removed from the trigger while reloading. Once fired, the <b>forend</b> is slid rearward by hand and the expended cartridge ejected. It is then reloaded by manually moving the <b>forend</b> to the front.|$|E

The receiver is bedded to the V-shaped stock, whilst the barrel is free-floated above the <b>forend.</b> The three piece AR-50 stock is constructed from aluminum and features an extruded <b>forend,</b> {{as well as}} a skeleton butt stock with a removable and vertically adjustable butt plate.|$|E

50|$|Another variant was the Burgess Folding Shotgun {{from the}} late 19th century where instead of {{manipulating}} the <b>forend</b> to cycle the action, it had a sleeve around the grip area of the stock which the shooter would slide back and forward to cycle the gun.
