5|$|Iron {{represents}} {{an example of}} allotropy in a metal. There are at least four allotropic forms of iron, known as α, γ, δ, and ε; at very high pressures and temperatures, some controversial experimental <b>evidence</b> <b>exists</b> for a stable β phase.|$|E
5|$|During the Middle Ages, farming was {{the most}} {{important}} activity in the area, and farming, both arable and dairy, continues today. There were also orchards producing fruits such as apples, pears, and plums. <b>Evidence</b> <b>exists</b> of lime kilns, used in the production of mortar for the construction of local churches.|$|E

5|$|In The Warlord Chronicles (1995–97), Bernard Cornwell makes Portland the Isle of the Dead, a {{place of}} {{internal}} exile, where the causeway was guarded to keep the 'dead' (people suffering insanity) from crossing the Fleet and returning to the mainland. No historical <b>evidence</b> <b>exists</b> to support this idea.|$|E
5|$|Regarding the {{relations}} of early Philippine polities with the various state-level polities of Indonesia and Malaysia, legendary accounts often mention the interaction of early Philippine polities with the Srivijaya empire, {{but there is not}} much archeological evidence to definitively support such a relationship. Considerable <b>evidence</b> <b>exists,</b> on the other hand, for extensive trade with the Majapahit empire.|$|E
5|$|Since {{this report}} was released, several {{independent}} reviews {{have examined the}} body of published research for a possible thiomersal-autism link by examining the theoretical mechanisms of thiomersal causing harm and by reviewing the in vitro, animal, and population {{studies that have been}} published. These reviews determined that no significant <b>evidence</b> <b>exists</b> to establish thiomersal as the cause of autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders.|$|E

5|$|The {{demonstration}} profile {{as designed}} by Holland included a 360° turn around Fairchild's air-traffic-control tower. Holland had not attempted this maneuver in previous air-show demonstrations. During the final flight, Holland performed {{a series of}} 60° banked turns and a 68° pitch climb in violation of Brooks' orders. No <b>evidence</b> <b>exists</b> that McGeehan or Wolff attempted to intervene as Holland executed the maneuvers.|$|E
5|$|TiCl4 is soluble in toluene and chlorocarbons, as {{are other}} {{non-polar}} species. <b>Evidence</b> <b>exists</b> that certain arenes form complexes {{of the type}} +. TiCl4 reacts exothermically with donor solvents such as THF to give hexacoordinated adducts. Bulkier ligands (L) give pentacoordinated adducts TiCl4L.|$|E
5|$|According to the National Register of Historic Places nomination, {{the first}} bridge was {{constructed}} in the early 1870s by the New York and Boston Air Line Railroad. The details on this bridge are largely unknown, but contradictory <b>evidence</b> <b>exists</b> placing {{the construction of the}} bridge between 1876 and 1877. According to Marshall, the Air Line Railroad was completed in 1873 and the Colchester branch was completed in 1877.|$|E
25|$|Haarmann {{was acquitted}} of three murders at his trial: those of Adolf Hennies, Hermann Wolf, and Hermann Bock. In each instance, strong circumstantial <b>evidence</b> <b>existed</b> attesting to his guilt.|$|R

5|$|American {{alligators}} will occasionally prey {{on large}} mammals, such as deer, but will usually do so when fish and smaller prey levels go down. Rarely, American alligators {{have been observed}} killing and eating bobcats, but such events are not common and have little effect on bobcat populations. Although American alligators have been listed as predators of West Indian manatees, very little <b>evidence</b> <b>exists</b> of such predation. In the 2000s, when invasive Burmese pythons occupied the Everglades, American alligators have been recorded preying on them, possibly controlling populations, thus preventing the invasive species to spread up north.|$|E
5|$|Antigonid Macedonian kings {{relied on}} various {{regional}} officials to conduct affairs of state. This included high-ranking municipal officials, {{such as the}} military strategos and the politarch, i.e. the elected governor (archon) of a large city (polis), {{as well as the}} politico-religious office of the epistates. No <b>evidence</b> <b>exists</b> about the personal backgrounds of these officials, although they may have been chosen among the same group of aristocratic philoi and hetairoi who filled vacancies for army officers.|$|E
5|$|Body piercing, {{a form of}} body modification, is the {{practice}} of puncturing or cutting {{a part of the}} human body, creating an opening in which jewelry may be worn. The word piercing can refer to the act or practice of body piercing, or to an opening in the body created by this act or practice. Although the history of body piercing is obscured by popular misinformation and by a lack of scholarly reference, ample <b>evidence</b> <b>exists</b> to document that it has been practiced in various forms by both sexes since ancient times throughout the world.|$|E

50|$|At her trial {{she pleaded}} innocent, but Wakayama District Court sentenced {{her to death}} in 2002. On June 28, 2005, Osaka High Court upheld her death sentence. However, her lawyers (Yoshihiro Yasuda among them) insisted on her innocence because only circumstantial <b>evidence</b> <b>existed.</b>|$|R
5|$|Dummy {{horses were}} {{sometimes}} used to deceive the enemy into misreading {{the location of}} troops. They were effectively used by Allenby during his campaigns in the east, especially late in the war. <b>Evidence</b> <b>exists</b> that the Germans used horses in their experimentations with chemical and biological warfare. German agents in the US are suspected of infecting cattle and horses bound for France with glanders, a disease which can fatally spread to humans; similar tactics were used by the Germans against the Russians, causing breakdowns {{in their ability to}} move artillery on the Eastern Front.|$|E
5|$|Good <b>evidence</b> <b>exists</b> for the {{appearance}} of gastropods (e.g. Aldanella), cephalopods (e.g. Plectronoceras, ?Nectocaris) and bivalves (Pojetaia, Fordilla) towards {{the middle of the}} Cambrian period, c. , though arguably each of these may belong only to the stem lineage of their respective classes. However, the evolutionary history both of the emergence of molluscs from the ancestral group Lophotrochozoa, and of their diversification into the well-known living and fossil forms, is still vigorously debated.|$|E
5|$|However, both Clinton and Larson {{present the}} {{possibility}} that Margaret was in fact Tubman's daughter. Larson {{points out that the}} two shared an unusually strong bond, and argues that Tubman – knowing the pain of a child separated from her mother – would never have intentionally caused a free family to be split apart. Clinton presents evidence of strong physical similarities, which Alice herself acknowledged. Both historians agree that no concrete <b>evidence</b> <b>exists</b> for such a possibility, and the mystery of Tubman's relationship with young Margaret remains to this day.|$|E
50|$|On June 11, 2012, the Minnesota Office of Administrative Hearings {{ruled that}} {{sufficient}} <b>evidence</b> <b>existed</b> for a complaint the Minnesota DFL Party filed against Sviggum and 14 Republican Senators regarding the pamphlets to continue. The complaint against Senator Doug Magnus was dismissed.|$|R
2500|$|In 1968, American {{engineer}} James Harder {{argued that}} significant <b>evidence</b> <b>existed</b> to prove UFOs [...] "beyond reasonable doubt," [...] {{but that the}} evidence had been suppressed and largely neglected by scientists and the general public, thus preventing sound conclusions from being reached on the ETH.|$|R
5000|$|Anthropologist James B. Griffin {{concluded}} in 1942 that no historical <b>evidence</b> <b>existed</b> {{to indicate that}} Siouan speaking tribes resided there.

5|$|Little <b>evidence</b> <b>exists</b> of {{settlements}} within the Rhondda during the Norman period. Unlike the communal dwellings of the Iron Age {{the remains of}} the Medieval buildings discovered in the area follow the pattern similar to modern farmsteads; with separate holdings spaced out around the hillsides. The evidence of Medieval Welsh farmers comes from {{the remains of the}}ir buildings, with the foundations of platform houses having been discovered spaced out throughout both valleys. When the site of several platform houses at Gelligaer Common were excavated in the 1930s potsherds dating from the 13th-14th century were discovered.|$|E
5|$|Many of the Green Mountain Boys {{objected to}} Arnold's wish to command, insisting {{that they would}} go home rather than serve under anyone other than Ethan Allen. Arnold and Allen worked out an agreement, but no {{documented}} <b>evidence</b> <b>exists</b> concerning the deal. According to Arnold, he was given joint command of the operation. Some historians have supported Arnold's contention, while others suggest he was merely given the right to march next to Allen.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the capital}} Halab {{has not been}} excavated, the {{architecture}} of the kingdom is archaeologically best represented by the city of Alalakh, which was subordinate to Halab and ruled by a king belonging to the Yamhadite royal house. The Amorites in general built large palaces that bear architectural similarities to old Baylonian-era palaces. They were adorned with grand central courtyards, throne rooms, tiled floors, drainage systems and plastered walls, which suggest the employment of specialized labor. <b>Evidence</b> <b>exists</b> for the presence of Minoan Aegean fresco artists who painted elaborate scenes {{on the walls of the}} palaces in Alalakh.|$|E
