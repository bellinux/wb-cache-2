2500|$|From its beginning, the colonia {{has been}} home to a mix of {{socioeconomic}} classes, with small businesses owned by the lower middle class located in grand buildings, which mostly now hold cultural or large business institutions. It {{is a mix of}} traditional and modern architecture as the area is in transition. It is a traditional neighborhood filled with mom-and-pop stores, workshops to repair anything from electronics to shoes, small eateries, many cantinas, shops that sell only <b>fresh</b> <b>chicken,</b> Chinese-Mexican cafes, and even men who come around to sharpen knives and collect scrap iron and newspapers. In a number of sections, its streets are filled with people during the day and neighbors can often be seen chatting on sidewalks and in local markets. The main festival of the year has been that of Saints Cosmas and Damian {{since the beginning of the}} neighborhood and is celebrated each year on 27 September. It is celebrated with music, fireworks and foods such as pozole, enchiladas with mole sauce, quesadillas with squash flowers and atole. Here rich and poor alike eat and enjoy the events in the same space. Many of the interiors of the old mansions have been remodeled into apartments that average about 90m2 in size with two bedrooms, conserving the original facade. Most, including many artists, who live here are attracted by the area’s past charm, reasonable prices and do not want to live far from the city center.|$|E

40|$|Eighty-two {{chickens}} {{purchased at}} 11 retailers (supplied by 12 wholesalers) {{in the south}} of England were cultured for Campylobacter jejuni by a method involving total immersion. The organism was isolated from 22 (48 %) of 46 fresh birds, 12 of 12 uneviscerated (New York dressed) birds, but only 1 of 24 frozen birds. Viable counts of up to 1. 5 x 10 (6) /chicken were obtained from fresh birds and 2. 4 x 10 (7) /chicken from uneviscerated birds. Surface swabbing of breasts, thighs, wings and vents of <b>fresh</b> <b>chickens</b> showed that contamination was generally distributed over the carcasses. Salmonellas were found in only 2 of 69 of the <b>fresh</b> <b>chickens.</b> The prevalence of several Lior and Penner C. jejuni serogroups was similar in chickens and sporadic human cases of enteritis. Penner serogroup 4 (mostly of Lior serogroup 1) was found in 26 % of human isolates and 14 % of chicken isolates. The rising incidence of campylobacter enteritis during the last 6 years could well be a reflection of the increasing proportion of <b>fresh</b> <b>chickens</b> consumed over that period (32 % higher in 1986 than in 1981) ...|$|R

40|$|Freezing and thawing {{affect the}} sensory profile {{and the quality}} of chicken meat, {{resulting}} in lower marketability. Retailers are faced with the risk of mislabeling, as <b>fresh</b> and frozen/thawed <b>chicken</b> meat are visually indistinguishable and as there is currently no fast, reproducible, and inexpensive technique for the differentiation of <b>fresh</b> and frozen/thawed <b>chicken</b> implemented in practice. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy represents a new promising technique that determines the overall chemical composition of a sample, thus creating a metabolic spectral fingerprint that can be analyzed by various pattern recognition algorithms. In this study, we aimed to assess the performance of FTIR spectroscopy when applied to the differentiation of <b>fresh</b> and frozen/thawed <b>chicken</b> meat. To this end, we compared the FTIR spectra of chicken stored at 4 °C to those of chicken that was frozen and stored at − 20 °C for 2, 5, 15, 30, 60, 70, and 85 days. Hierarchical cluster analysis of FTIR spectra allowed to distinguish fresh samples from samples that have been frozen for longer periods. Samples of frozen storage of 15, 30, 75 and 85 days could be clearly identified as such. Further, the potential of combining FTIR spectroscopy with artificial neuronal network (ANN) analysis to enable identification of even shortly frozen products was determined. Twenty out of 21 samples were correctly classified in either <b>fresh</b> or frozen/thawed <b>chicken</b> meat based on the internal validation including frozen/thawed chicken meat samples derived from day 2 and 5. In conclusion, we provide proof of principle that FTIR spectroscopy enables rapid and reliable discrimination of <b>fresh</b> from frozen/thawed <b>chicken</b> meat. Due to its high–throughput capacity, it could represent a promising tool in routine inspections differentiating fresh from previously frozen meat products such as beef, pork, lamb and turkey...|$|R

40|$|Campylobacters were {{sought in}} swabs taken from work surfaces, sinks and floors of four kitchens-i. e. hospital, university, cook-freeze and commercial, {{processing}} frozen or <b>fresh</b> <b>chickens.</b> Each kitchen was visited on four occasions. In the large commercial kitchen environmental contamination {{was found on}} each visit, whereas campylobacters were isolated on six of the twelve visits to the other kitchens.

Cleaning with detergent and hot water (or steam) and drying appears to be sufficient to remove the organism from the environment. Evidence of carriage of campylobacters by the birds was obtained on all 16 visits. In the three kitchens where only frozen birds were used the organism was isolated from 30 % and 9. 8 % of swabs taken from the internal and external surfaces respectively, while 41 % of giblets and 22. 2 % of thawed juices yielded campylobacters.
