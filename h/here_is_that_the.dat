25|$|Wren's {{solution}} was to employ a Classical portico, as at Val-de-Grâce, but rising through two storeys, and supported on paired columns.

The gaps between the upper stage of the portico and the towers on either side are bridged by a narrow section of wall with an arch-topped window.|$|E

25|$|For example, if E is a vector bundle over X, {{then there}} is a bundle E* over X, called the dual bundle, whose fiber at x ∈ X is the dual vector space (Ex)*. Formally E* can be defined as the set of pairs (x, φ), where x ∈ X and φ ∈ (E'x)*. The dual bundle is locally trivial because the dual space of the inverse of a local trivialization of E is a local trivialization of E*: the key point <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{operation}} of taking the dual vector space is functorial.|$|E
25|$|Generalizing from static {{electricity}} to electromagnetism, {{we have a}} second potential, the magnetic vector potential A, which can also undergo gauge transformations. These transformations may be local. That is, rather than adding a constant onto V, one can add a function that takes on different values {{at different points in}} space and time. If A is also changed in certain corresponding ways, then the same E and B fields result. The detailed mathematical relationship between the fields E and B and the potentials V and A is given in the article Gauge fixing, along with the precise statement {{of the nature of the}} gauge transformation. The relevant point <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fields remain the same under the gauge transformation, and therefore Maxwell's equations are still satisfied.|$|E
25|$|This {{includes}} {{cases in}} which there is contact equilibrium between the system, and several subsystems in its surroundings, including separate connections with subsystems through walls that are permeable to the transfer of matter and internal energy as heat and allowing friction of passage of the transferred matter, but immovable, and separate connections through adiabatic walls with others, and separate connections through diathermic walls impermeable to matter with yet others. Because there are physically separate connections that are permeable to energy but impermeable to matter, between the system and its surroundings, energy transfers between them can occur with definite heat and work characters. Conceptually essential <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> internal energy transferred with the transfer of matter is measured by a variable that is mathematically independent of the variables that measure heat and work.|$|E

25|$|Modern mayflies have {{eliminated}} all the instars between imago and nymph, except the single instar called subimago, {{which is still}} not (at {{least not in the}} males) fully sexually mature. The other flying insects with incomplete metamorphosis (Exopterygota) have gone a little further and completed the trend; here all the immature structures of the animal from the last nymphal stage are completed at once in a single final moult. The more advanced insects with larvae and complete metamorphosis (Endopterygota) have gone even further. An interesting theory <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> pupal stage is actually a strongly modified and extended stage of subimago, but so far it {{is nothing more than a}} theory. Interestingly enough there are some insects within the Exopterygota, thrips and whiteflies (Aleyrodidae), who have evolved pupae-like stages too.|$|E
25|$|The La Nueva Viga seafood market {{next door}} alone handles about {{sixty percent of}} all that is {{consumed}} in the country of Mexico. This market commercializes 1,500 tons per day and was built in the 1990s to replace the older La Viga Market, although the latter still operates. The next largest market is the Mercado del Mar in Zapopan, Jalisco, which commercializes about ten percent of all the seafood sold in Mexico. The {{governor of the state of}} Baja California and the Comision Nacional de Acuacutura y Pesca (Conapesca) is working on a project to open a wholesale seafood market in the state to compete with the La Nueva Viga and Mercado del Mar markets. One reason to put such a market <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> seas around the Baja California peninsula produces about 75% of the country's seafood.|$|E
25|$|Conventional {{temporal}} probabilistic models such as {{the hidden}} Markov model (HMM) and conditional random fields (CRF) model directly model {{the correlations between the}} activities and the observed sensor data. In recent years, increasing evidence has supported the use of hierarchical models which take into account the rich hierarchical structure that exists in human behavioral data. The core idea <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> model does not directly correlate the activities with the sensor data, but instead breaks the activity into sub-activities (sometimes referred to as actions) and models the underlying correlations accordingly. An example could be the activity of preparing spaghetti, which can be broken down into the subactivities or actions of cutting vegetables, frying the vegetables in a pan and serving it on a plate. Examples of such a hierarchical model are Layered Hidden Markov Models (LHMMs) and the hierarchical hidden Markov model (HHMM), which have been shown to significantly outperform its non-hierarchical counterpart in activity recognition.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the indigenous Indian architecture which was of the trabeate order, i.e. all spaces were spanned by means of horizontal beams, the Islamic architecture was arcuate, i.e. an arch or dome was adopted {{as a method of}} bridging a space. The concept of arch or dome was not invented by the Muslims but was, in fact, borrowed and further perfected by them from the architectural styles of the post-Roman period. Muslims used a cementing agent in the form of mortar {{for the first time in}} the construction of buildings in India. They further put to use certain scientific and mechanical formulae, which were derived by experience of other civilisations, in their constructions in India. Such use of scientific principles helped not only in obtaining greater strength and stability of the construction materials but also provided greater flexibility to the architects and builders. One fact that must be stressed <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>the</b> Islamic elements of architecture had already passed through different experimental phases in other countries like Egypt, Iran and Iraq before these were introduced in India. Unlike most Islamic monuments in these countries, which were largely constructed in brick, plaster and rubble, the Indo-Islamic monuments were typical mortar-masonry works formed of dressed stones. It must be emphasized that the development of the Indo-Islamic architecture was greatly facilitated by the knowledge and skill possessed by the Indian craftsmen, who had mastered the art of stonework for centuries and used their experience while constructing Islamic monuments in India.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked if}} the 1995 thriller film Seven was an {{inspiration}} to Saw, Whannell said [...] "For me as the writer, definitely. I mean, Seven is just a very well constructed film, and if you're writing a thriller, it can't hurt to study it. In terms of the story though, James and I never really felt Seven was that close to our film. I guess if you stand back, you have two detectives chasing a psychopath, who uses vile methods to teach people lessons, and those points echo Seven. What we always liked about Saw, though, {{was the fact that}} the story is told from the point of view of two of the psychopath's victims, instead of the police chasing after him, as you so often see." [...] Entertainment Weekly Owen Gleiberman compared the plot to Seven saying, [...] "In a blatant imitation of Seven, Saw features a lunatic sadist whose ghoulish crimes are meant, in each case, to mirror the sins of his victims. The twist <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> psycho doesn't do the killing." [...] Richard J. Leskosky of Champaign-Urbana's The News-Gazette said [...] "Saw wants to be taken as another Seven. Though it features perverse gross-out scenes and a villain with a superficially pedantic motive behind his crimes (his victims, if they survive, have learned to appreciate life more), it lacks the finesse and polish of the David Fincher film." ...|$|E
