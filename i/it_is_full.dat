5|$|At the game, {{bisexual}} drama teacher Andrew LeGustambos {{attempts to}} grab the attention of both Larry and Miracle, but the whole school stands in shock as Stuart arrives with two full and augmented breasts; the pills he had taken were actually librarian Helen Klench's female hormone replacements. Nonetheless, the school loses the game. Sue finally reveals she was not planning on actually firing any teacher on her watch. Helen arrives to inform them {{that they did not}} need to win the game after all; she had found a rare time capsule with treasures. Upon opening the time capsule, it is revealed that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>full</b> of Willard's porn magazines that Ennis hid. Sue pitifully looks at Willard and tells him he is fired.|$|E
5|$|While a grind, lip, or manual {{trick is}} underway, a balance meter appears: unless the player {{prevents}} this meter from {{falling to the}} left or right, the character will bail and need a few seconds to recover. Bailing can also be caused by falling without one's board facing downward. Completing tricks in succession without bailing is called a combo. Comboing raises the player's score and fills up the Special Meter; when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>full,</b> the player is granted access to more elaborate tricks worth more points, such as the McTwist and 540 Flip. Underground introduces the ability to dismount one's skateboard, which allows the player to explore levels more carefully and reach new areas. Each level features at least one vehicle, usually a car, that the player can drive.|$|E
25|$|Adding {{elements}} to a dynamic array will occasionally (when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>full)</b> unexpectedly take linear (O(n)) instead of constant time (although it's still an amortized constant).|$|E

25|$|Growing a large array when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>full</b> may be {{difficult}} or impossible, whereas finding space for a new linked list node in a large, general memory pool may be easier.|$|E
25|$|Parque del perro: Located in the San Fernando neighborhood, {{this is one}} of {{the most}} popular areas in the city. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>full</b> of {{restaurants}} and bars. The park gets its name because it has a dog monument in the middle of it.|$|E
25|$|Felsőváros (Upper Town), {{formerly}} Csebokszári (Cheboksary – capital town of Chuvash Republic, Russia) – The largest {{housing estate}} of Eger, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>full</b> {{of four and}} ten-storied concrete buildings, providing homes for {{one third of the}} town's population.

25|$|Unlike other Jewish traditions, which depict God in {{relatively}} simple terms, the Zohar is intentionally obscure. As a work <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>full</b> of neologisms, linguistic borrowings, occasional grammatical mistakes, and inspired wordplay on rabbinic and biblical passages. Its ideas are often inconsistent and conflicting, referring to abstract concepts that are never completely expressed.|$|E
25|$|Patrick White and Christina Stead {{continue}} to be widely recognised as the foremost Australian novelists of the 20th century. His writing tackles existential questions as well as myriad human flaws, weaknesses and hypocrisies, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>full</b> of fresh and original metaphor. Admittedly, White's style is also often very condensed and perhaps at first somewhat difficult to approach – such noted writers as Robert Hughes and David Malouf have expressed their difficulties with some of White's writing. Nevertheless, Patrick White's greatness as a novelist remains undoubted.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} scene, Rosie is {{waiting in the}} flat ready. She has been {{reassured}} {{that she will be}} watched on camera, and help will come if there's any trouble. She is in the company of Tommy Angel, an ex-SAS bodyguard who makes wildly optimistic passes at Rosie, such as suggesting that many people find this sort of danger arousing. Tommy then asks Rosie to hit him on the head to show how tough he is. Rosie does so, and Tommy instantly falls unconscious, out of view. Seconds later, Edna calls at the door. Rosie plays the part of Joanna well, and hands over the case of money from a hidden compartment in a table as soon as she sees the drugs. Unfortunately, when Edna inspects the briefcase, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>full</b> of cut newspaper instead of money. Even though Rosie knows nothing about it, Edna tries to punish Rosie by spraying acid in her eyes. After a struggle, Edna catches her and is about to do the deed when Tracy comes in and brutally incapacitates her.|$|E

25|$|Loki's {{relation}} with the gods varies by source; Loki sometimes assists the gods and sometimes behaves in a malicious manner towards them. Loki is a shape shifter and in separate incidents he appears {{in the form of}} a salmon, a mare, a fly, and possibly an elderly woman named Þökk (Old Norse 'thanks'). Loki's positive relations with the gods end with his role in engineering the death of the god Baldr and Loki is eventually bound by Váli with the entrails of one of his sons. In both the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda, the goddess Skaði is responsible for placing a serpent above him while he is bound. The serpent drips venom from above him that Sigyn collects into a bowl; however, she must empty the bowl when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>full,</b> and the venom that drips in the meantime causes Loki to writhe in pain, thereby causing earthquakes. With the onset of Ragnarök, Loki is foretold to slip free from his bonds and to fight against the gods among the forces of the jötnar, at which time he will encounter the god Heimdallr and the two will slay each other.|$|E
500|$|Adaptive Coloration in Animals is a 500-page book, [...] in {{its first}} edition. It was {{published}} by Methuen (in London) and Oxford University Press (in New York) in 1940. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>full</b> of detailed observations of types of camouflage and other uses of colour in animals, and illustrated by the author with clear drawings and photographs. There is a coloured frontispiece showing eight of Cott's paintings of tropical amphibians. The book has 48 monotone plates and several illustrations.|$|E
500|$|Fleming {{compares the}} mass to Rossini's operas and early mass {{settings}} and finds restrained vocal lines, {{even in the}} melismas of the Agnus Dei, but observes his [...] "predilection for spicy harmonic twists". She summarizes his [...] "optimistic and deeply felt faith. Robert King, the conductor of The King's Consort, notes: [...] "It certainly is solennelle, for it is a heartfelt religious work which shows the extraordinary compositional capabilities of this astonishing man of the theatre: <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>full</b> of drama, pathos, colour and intensity." ...|$|E

500|$|Hoover Dam impounds Lake Mead, {{the largest}} {{reservoir}} in the United States by volume (when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>full).</b> The dam is located near Boulder City, Nevada, a municipality originally constructed for {{workers on the}} construction project, about [...] southeast of Las Vegas, Nevada. The dam's generators provide power for public and private utilities in Nevada, Arizona, and California. Hoover Dam is a major tourist attraction; nearly a million people tour the dam each year. The heavily traveled U.S. Route 93 (US93) ran along the dam's crest until October 2010, when the Hoover Dam Bypass opened.|$|E
500|$|The Everglades are {{dominated}} by sawgrass in water; this is the titular [...] "River of Grass" [...] popularized by Marjory Stoneman Douglas in 1947. This river contains {{a wide variety of}} plant and animal life. An early American environmentalist named Gifford Pinchot said of the Everglades, [...] "It is a region so different that it hardly seems to belong to the United States. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>full</b> of the most vivid and most interesting life on land, in the air, and in the water. It is a land of strangeness, separate and apart from the common things we all know so well." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{these last}} years at Idlewild, Willis {{continued}} contributing a weekly {{letter to the}} Home Journal. In 1850 he assisted Rufus Wilmot Griswold in preparing an anthology {{of the works of}} Poe, who had died mysteriously the year before. Griswold also wrote the first biography of Poe in which he purposely set out to ruin the dead author's reputation. Willis {{was one of the most}} vocal of Poe's defenders, writing at one point: [...] "The indictment (for it deserves no other name) is not true. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>full</b> of cruel misrepresentations. It deepens the shadows unto unnatural darkness, and shuts out the rays of sunshines that ought to relieve them".|$|E

500|$|Fields {{then left}} American Graffiti. It took {{another six months}} of editing to create a shorter, 110-minute version of the film, but upon its release in 1973 American Graffiti was {{extremely}} successful both with critics and at the box office. Shortly after its release, Roger Greenspun described the film and its editing: [...] "American Graffiti exists {{not so much in}} its individual stories as in its orchestration of many stories, its sense of time and place. Although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>full</b> of the material of fashionable nostalgia, it never exploits nostalgia. In its feeling for movement and music and the vitality of the night—and even in its vision in white—it is oddly closer to some early Fellini than to the recent American past of, say, The Last Picture Show or Summer of '42." ...|$|E
500|$|The game also {{features}} role-playing elements based on {{three types of}} experience points (XP): Triad, Face and Police XPs. Triad XP is obtained through melee combat and violent actions such as [...] "environmental kills". Face XP, obtained in civilian side missions, fills Shen's face meter and unlocks cosmetic items such as clothes and vehicles. By reaching a higher Face level, the player can freely buy vehicles or clothing. When <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>full,</b> Shen gains health regeneration, increased attack damage and other benefits. Police XP is gained by minimizing civilian casualties and property damage in missions and by completing police side missions. Gaining XP unlocks abilities such as hot-wiring cars and disarming opponents. The clothes, accessories and vehicles purchased by Shen affect non-player characters' reactions toward him. Players may also collect jade statues used to unlock melee combat skills.|$|E
500|$|While small minions {{require only}} a single combo attack for Crash to defeat, larger enemies, known as [...] "Titans", require more effort to subdue. Each of the fifteen unique Titans in the game possess a star meter that {{indicates}} how close they are to being stunned. The meter rises when Crash starts attacking a Titan, and depletes when he stops. When <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>full,</b> the Titan is stunned and susceptible to [...] "jacking", meaning Crash can mount the creature and control it. While controlled by the player, the Titan possesses a similar moveset to Crash, although some jacked Titans can shoot projectiles. Besides a greater health, the Titans controlled by Crash have a purple Titan Meter. When this meter is full, players can make the Titan unleash a special attack, which fully drains the meter in the process.|$|E
