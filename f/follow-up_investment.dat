40|$|We {{examine the}} extent to which Chinese {{government}} support of foreign direct investment (FDI) projects and host country institutional environments interact with prior entry experience by Chinese firms, and how this interrelationship affects FDI undertaken by Chinese firms. We hypothesize that home country government support and well-established host country institutions enhance organizational capabilities to take risks in FDI. As such, they reduce the need to accumulate experiential knowledge and capabilities relating to entering host countries based on prior entry experience in a particular country when undertaking <b>follow-up</b> <b>investment</b> projects. Using a unique, hand-collected panel data set of Chinese publicly listed firms during 2002 – 2009, we find that home government support and well-developed host country institutions reduce the importance of prior entry experience and significantly increase the likelihood of FDI entry into a host country. Further, from our subsample analyses we identify differences between entering developed and developing host countries in terms of the impact of home country government support and quality of host country institutions. Our findings help explain the puzzle concerning why emerging economy firms have rapidly internationalized {{in a short period of}} time and do not follow the pattern predicted by classical IB theories...|$|E

40|$|This paper compares optimal {{financial}} {{contracts with}} centralized and decentralized firms. Under centralized contracting headquarters raises funds {{on behalf of}} multiple projects and then allocates the funds on the firm’s internal capital market. Under decentralized contracting each project raises funds separately on the external capital market. The benefit of centralization is that headquarters can use excess liquidity from high-cash flow projects to buy continuation rights for low cash-flow projects. This allows headquarters to make greater repayments to investors, which eases financing constraints ex ante. The cost is that headquarters may pool cash flows from several projects, thereby accumulate internal funds, and make <b>follow-up</b> <b>investments</b> without having {{to return to the}} capital market.

50|$|The sales {{division}} {{is responsible for}} commercially selling real estate {{that the federal government}} no longer requires. This includes residential property, commercial property, land, military installations and culturally significant buildings. The Institute for Federal Real Estate considers the division's specialty to be the marketing of military areas that have been used by the armed forces of Germany (Bundeswehr) and foreign military forces. The division's long-term aim is to dispose about 30,000 properties, by selling around 3,000 annually. The properties sold are often subject to <b>follow-up</b> <b>investments,</b> such as converting former military areas into residential estates and recreational facilities. The Institute for Federal Real Estate does not by itself engage in such real estate development, but rather works together with state authorities, local authorities and investors. The revenue generated by the sales division accounts for around 50% of the total revenue generated.|$|R

40|$|We model an {{investment}} in a foreign subsidiary, the outside finance to which is injected by its parent company from abroad. Sinn’s (1993) initial “underinvestment” problem due to taxes on repatriated dividends is argued to also concern all <b>follow-up</b> <b>investments</b> of the subsidiary financed from its marginal profits that represent the required return on the initial investment. The dividend tax capitalization hypothesis in the international context, or the Sinn-Hartman neutrality theorem, is valid only if the initial investment generates intra-marginal profits and concerns their reinvestment, the returns of which are repatriated dividends. The results reveal that the ownership structure of the parent and the consequent tax preference for dividends affect foreign source intra-marginal profits differently from domestic source ones. In particular, the cost of capital for foreign intra-marginal profits is inversely affected by the home-country dividend tax. We calibrate the cost of capital formulae to the parameter values of the Estonian and Finnish systems of taxing international investment income. The calculations show that the Estonian subsidiaries, paying no tax on undistributed profits but a corporate dividend tax, offer tax benefits to their parent companies only by their intra-marginal profits...|$|R
40|$|A {{growing concern}} exists {{regarding}} {{the efficiency of}} public resources spent in transport infrastructures. In this paper, we measure the efficiency of seven highway projects in Portugal {{over the past decade}} by means of a data envelopment analysis and the Malmquist productivity and efficiency indices. We distinguish between technical and technological efficiency and find that most highways face a reduction over time in both types of efficiency. This reduction is mainly due to an increase in operating and maintenance costs, <b>follow-up</b> <b>investments,</b> and a decline in traffic. Some highways only experience a reduction in technological efficiency after a decrease in traffic. They compensate with cost controls and stable investments. While controlling for scale efficiencies, we find a lack of pure technical efficiency in highways that are not subject to a competitive environment, which produces a lack of incentives for better management. Not only does evidence exist of poor management {{due to a lack of}} competition, but the increased use of outsourcing also increases inefficiencies. The introduction of tolls and the outburst of the economic crisis in Portugal have substantially reduced traffic that further contributes to inefficiency. The local context, such as highways in low-income areas and rural regions with a lower traffic density, also affects highway performance...|$|R

40|$|International audienceModern paper {{machines}} {{are equipped with}} heat recovery systems that transfer heat from the humid exhaust air of the paper machine's dryer section to different process streams. As a result of process changes, the heat recovery systems may operate in conditions far from the original design point, creating a significant potential for energy efficiency improvement. In this paper we demonstrate this potential with {{a case study of}} three operating paper machines. Both operational and structural improvement opportunities are examined. Since the existing retrofit methodologies for heat exchanger networks can not be applied to cases with condensing air, we use thermodynamic simulation models presented earlier to assess the effects of possible changes on the existing heat recovery systems. In order to reduce the required processing time of the simulation models, {{only a limited number of}} pre-screened retrofit designs are considered. The pre-screening is carried out on the basis of guidelines presented earlier. The analysis in the case mill revealed savings of 110 GWh/a in process heat with profitable investments. According to the <b>follow-up</b> study, the <b>investments</b> carried out have resulted in 12 % lower fuel use and 24 % lower CO emissions.

The UK Commission for Employment and Skills' (UKCES) Employer Skills Survey is a biennial UK-wide individual establishment telephone survey, providing the most detailed picture of training, vacancies, skills gaps, and investment in training. The aims are to provide rigorous and robust intelligence on the UK labour market and the market for skills. The survey has two waves, with a mainstage questionnaire of c. 91, 000 establishments, and a <b>follow-up</b> survey of <b>investment</b> in training of c. 13, 000 establishments that have conducted training over the previous 12 months. A Secure Access version of the Employer Skills Survey for 2011 is held by the UK Data Archive under SN 7745. Two previous studies, the National Employer Skills Survey, 2007 - 2009 : Secure Access (NESS), covering England only, and the Scottish Employer Skills Survey, 2008 - 2010 : Secure Access, covering Scotland, are held at the Archive under SNs 6705 and 6857 repectively. Both studies are subject to restrictive Secure Access conditions (see the SN 6705 and 6857 catalogue records for full details). The UKCES also conducts the Employer Perspectives Survey (UKCEPS) series (held at the Archive under SN 33466), which began in 2010. The UKCEPS provides a comprehensive examination of employer perspectives on key aspects of the employment, skills and business support systems in the UK. Further information may {{be found on the}} UKCES Employer Skills Survey webpage. The Employer Skills Survey, 2011 harmonised skills surveys from across the four UK nations, following individual surveys undertaken in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. As predecessor surveys used different inclusion criteria for establishments, the 2011 survey had a broad sample frame to accommodate all UK nation requirements. A single unified sample frame was introduced for 2013, and this version of the 2011 study has been reweighted to be comparable with the 2013 data. For the third edition (June 2016) {{a new version of the}} Investment in Training file, reweighted to 2015 figures, and accompanying tables, were deposited. Main Topics : Establishment characteristics, retention and recruitment, vacancies, demand for skills and skills gaps, hard-to-fill vacancies, workforce development and training, skills utilisation and high performance working, business strategy and structure...|$|R
