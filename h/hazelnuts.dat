40|$|Although <b>hazelnut</b> is {{cultivated}} {{in many countries}} around the world, the number of countries producing <b>hazelnut</b> in international trade scale is limited.

40|$|<b>Hazelnut</b> is a {{frequently}} consumed tree nut. This thesis {{shows that}} allergic symptoms to <b>hazelnut</b> are common but highly variable in severity, and they differ between children and adults. <b>Hazelnut</b> allergy in adults is generally limited to mild and local symptoms {{in the oral}} cavity, whereas in children, more severe symptoms such as angio-edema, urticaria and dyspnea are frequently observed. In adults, <b>hazelnut</b> allergy is associated with birch pollen allergy, whereas in children, it is often accompanied by atopic dermatitis. A correct diagnosis is important, to advise appropriate dietary restrictions and emergency medication. In adults, a history with only oral symptoms specifically attributed to <b>hazelnut</b> in combination with birch pollinosis is convincing to diagnose a <b>hazelnut</b> allergy. A history of allergic reactions with previous ingestion of <b>hazelnut</b> is often unknown in children, because many children have an elimination diet solely based on sensitization. Therefore, the diagnosis in children strongly relies on diagnostic tests. The skin prick test (SPT) with <b>hazelnut</b> extract is a better predictor of a <b>hazelnut</b> allergy in children than laboratory tests for specific IgE to <b>hazelnut.</b> Although the SPT with <b>hazelnut</b> extract can {{reduce the number of}} double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges (DBPCFCs), a DBPCFC remains necessary in the majority of children to diagnose a <b>hazelnut</b> allergy. IgE to <b>hazelnut</b> seed storage proteins Cor a 9 and Cor a 14 was shown to be highly specific for a severe <b>hazelnut</b> allergy in children and adults. Determination of IgE to these components may identify almost all children and half of the adults with a severe <b>hazelnut</b> allergy, which may lead to a significant {{reduction in the number of}} high-risk DBPCFCs. The amount of <b>hazelnut</b> needed to elicit objective symptoms was comparable between children and adults. Several patient characteristics such as age, SPT to <b>hazelnut</b> extract and IgE to Cor a 9 and Cor a 14 influenced the threshold distribution curve (TDC) to <b>hazelnut.</b> Labeling information based on eliciting doses may improve the product choice of individuals with a severe <b>hazelnut</b> allergy. Allergy to peanut is common in individuals with a <b>hazelnut</b> allergy. Almost half of the children and adults with a sensitization to <b>hazelnut</b> seed storage proteins were also sensitized to their homologous proteins in peanut. This was shown not to be the result of IgE cross-reactivity, whereas at T cell level, cross-reactivity between <b>hazelnut</b> and peanut major allergens was observed. This suggests that cross-reactivity at T cell level may lead to IgE antibodies to related allergens that are not cross-reactive. This may explain the frequently observed co-sensitization to multiple tree nuts and peanut and may provide a basis to develop an immunotherapeutic target. In conclusion, our data show differences in clinical aspects of a <b>hazelnut</b> allergy between children and adults. Measurement of IgE to Cor a 9 and Cor a 14 may improve the diagnosis of a severe <b>hazelnut</b> allergy, which may result in a reduction of the number of DBPCFCs and unnecessary elimination diets. Better understanding of the mechanism leading to a concomitant <b>hazelnut</b> and peanut allergy may provide a basis for the development of preventive or therapeutic strategies...|$|R

40|$|In Turkey, <b>hazelnut</b> grows {{mostly in}} the Eastern Black Sea Region of the country, and has also a vital impact on {{regional}} economical development. Most important task is to determine what areas exactly <b>hazelnut</b> grows {{and how it can}} be grown-up productively in the region. The principle aim of this study is, firstly, to create a methodology for determining existing and potential <b>hazelnut</b> plantation areas, using GIS/Remote Sensing techniques in order to help <b>hazelnut</b> policies developers and economists. This study was done in the province of Trabzon {{which is one of the}} most <b>hazelnut</b> produced area of Turkey. In this study, Landsat ETM+ image was used to generate a current land cover classification. Using the supervised classification method, overall accuracy was determined as 84. 7 %. As for <b>hazelnut</b> growing areas, an 87. 9 % overall accuracy percentage was reached. It was determined that there is an area of 71. 401 hectares <b>hazelnut</b> plantation area in the Trabzon province. Because <b>hazelnut</b> production exceeds the consumption in Turkey, some new regulations have been released to find new land use policies since 1983. By putting into practice these regulations that restrict <b>hazelnut</b> plantation areas, a more efficient and productive <b>hazelnut</b> harvest policy should be reached. As a result, potential <b>hazelnut</b> areas were determined and examined with respect to raster-based spatial analysis functions of GIS. 1...|$|R

The most famous Italian wines are probably the Tuscan Chianti and the Piedmontese Barolo.

They chewed pine pitch like gum, and had a range of herbal medicines. Starting in June, mature salmon arrived at Kettle Falls, the farthest downriver that the Sinixt territory extended. The Sinixt caught only the salmon that were not strong enough to clear the falls, ensuring that the strongest went on to spawn. Both bands traveled to Red Mountain near Rossland, B.C. to harvest huckleberries in August. These seasonal events figured prominently in their culture.
