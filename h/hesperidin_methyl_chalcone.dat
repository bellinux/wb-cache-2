40|$|Since {{hesperidin}} {{is a poor}} {{water soluble}} compound, in pharmaceutical formulations its methylated derivatives (<b>hesperidin</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>chalcone,</b> HMC) are used. The {{aim of this study}} was to establish an efficient methylation method for preparation of hesperidin methyl derivatives. For this purpose hesperidin was isolated from tangerine peel, purified and its methyl derivatives were prepared using three different techniques, i. e. diazomethane, methyl iodide-sodium hydride and dimethylsulfate. The efficiency of the methods was evaluated in terms of the percentage of unchanged and intact hesperidin in the final methylated products the and amount of unchanged hesperidin was an indication of the better efficiency of the method. A reversed phase HPLC method was also developed for determination and quantification of hesperidin in the final methylated products. The method involved the use of a Shim pack CLC-ODS column, a mixture of methanol-phosphate buffer (37 : 63, v/v) of pH = 2. 6 as a mobile phase in an isocratic mode at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and UV detection at 280 nm. The results showed that methylation with methyl iodide-sodium hydride have the highest efficiency among different methylation methods...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCytokines and {{reactive}} {{oxygen species}} are inflammatory mediators that lead to increased sensitivity to painful stimuli, and their inhibition represents a therapeutic approach in controlling acute and chronic pain. The water-soluble flavonone <b>hesperidin</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>chalcone</b> (HMC) {{is used in the}} treatment of venous diseases, but its bioactivity as anti-inflammatory and analgesic is poorly understood. The present study evaluated the protective effects of HMC in widely used mouse models of acute and prolonged inflammation and pain. Male Swiss mice were treated with HMC (3 – 100 or 30 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) or vehicle (saline) 1 h before inflammatory stimuli. In overt pain-like behavior tests, HMC inhibited acetic acid- and phenyl-p-benzoquinone-induced writhing, and capsaicin-, Complete Freund’s Adjuvant (CFA) - and formalin-induced paw flinching and licking. HMC also inhibited carrageenan-, capsaicin- and CFA-induced mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia. Mechanistically, HMC inhibited carrageenan-induced cytokine (TNF-α, IL- 1 β, IL- 6, and IL- 10) production, oxidative stress and NF-κB activation. Furthermore, HMC did not cause gastric or hepatic injury in a 7 days treatment protocol. Thus, this is the first report that HMC reduces inflammation and inflammatory pain by targeting TRPV 1 (transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1) receptor activity, oxidative stress, cytokine production, and NF-κB activity, which suggests its potential applicability in inflammatory diseases...|$|E
40|$|ECV- 304 endothelial cells {{derived from}} human {{umbilical}} cords were maintained {{for up to}} 48 hours under hypoxia in {{presence or absence of}} CYCLO 3 FORT and its individual constituents, namely Ruscus extract Hesperidine <b>Methyl</b> <b>Chalcone</b> and Ascorbic Acid. The cell survival was determined by the MTT tetrazolium test. Cell survival after 24 or 48 hours of hypoxia did not exceed 8 % while in presence of the drug preparation at 330 mu g/ml the cell survival was about 37 %. and 25 % respectively. The protection was dose dependent and observed even at 12 mu g/ml. Each of the constituents afforded a dose dependant protection against hypoxia at doses higher than 100 mu g/ml. There seems to be a synergistic effect among them, since the sum of the protecting effects conferred by each constituent individually is at least 5 times lower than that of CYCLO 3 FORT. On endothelial cells from porcine pulmonary arteries maintained in normoxia we have observed a dose dependant stimulation of mitochondrial succinate deshydrogenase activity by CYCLO 3 FORT, with an optimal effect at 250 mu g/ml. The stimulation of the oxidative metabolism which normally leads to the production of ATP has also been observed with the constituents of the drug preparation, mainly by Hesperidine <b>Methyl</b> <b>Chalcone</b> and Ascorbic Acid. Therefore the protection against hypoxia conferred to endothelial cells by CYCLO 3 FORT and its constituents could be due to the stimulation of the oxidative metabolism of those cells. These observations could contribute {{to the understanding of the}} therapeutic properties of CYCLO 3 FORT...|$|R
40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} is {{a global}} disease, prevails all over the world, though the prevalence rate differs from country to country. Diabetes, a disorder of carbohydrate metabolism, is characterized by high blood glucose level and glycosuria resulting from dysfunction of pancreatic beta cells and insulin resistance. In advance stages of diabetes, metabolism of protein and lipid is also altered. Many factors like heredity, age, obesity, diet, sex, sedentary life style, socio economic status, hypertension and various stresses {{are involved in the}} etiology of diabetes mellitus. Drug, diet and recently spices therapies are the major approaches used for treatment and control of diabetes mellitus. In drug therapy, hypoglycemic medicines and insulin are used. In diet therapy, diet composition, amount, distribution and time of food intake are important factors. The diet must be acceptable, must supply adequate amount of nutrients, and be formulated in a way to normalize body weight. The diet for diabetic children should have sufficient calories for adequate nutrition, normal weight gain and growth. The diet should be high in complex carbohydrate, low in simple carbohydrate, low in fat and high in mono-unsaturated fatty acid. High fiber diets are beneficial for treatment of diabetes. Soluble fibers are more effective than insoluble fibers. Chromium is important for diabetes and functions in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism primarily via its role in potentiating insulin action in carbohydrate metabolism. In the spices therapy, cinnamon, cloves, bay leaves and turmeric have an insulin potentiating activity and are beneficial for diabetic individuals. Cinnamon is effective in reducing glucose level in type 2 diabetic individuals. The effective ingredient in cinnamon for hypoglycemic function has been identified as <b>methyl</b> hydroxy <b>chalcone</b> polymers. Other plant products have also hypoglycemic activities and may have beneficial role in treatment of diabetes mellitus. Cinnamon should be a part of diabetic diets for its hypoglycemic effect in diabetic individuals...|$|R
40|$|M. Tech. There {{are over}} 250 {{cinnamon}} species existing worldwide, and amongst them, 2 species Cinnamomum cassia and Cinnamomum zeylanicum, {{are commonly used}} {{all over the world}} as spices, fragrances in perfumes and as medicines. These two species are distinguished from each other by the presence and absence of certain compounds depending on the origin and distribution of the plant. Nevertheless, all cinnamon species contain essential oils and water soluble components and the composition of these components found in each species depends on the type of species involved. These components are made up of phenyl propanoids, terpenes, flavonoids and saponins. In general, the essential oil component contains the following compounds: cinnamaldehyde as a major constituent with its derivatives cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, ethyl cinnamate, cinnamyl acetate and 2 -methoxy cinnamaldehyde; eugenol; linalool; coumarin; carvone; carvacrol and β-caryophyllene. Most of these compounds are abundantly found in the bark except in the case of eugenol which is found in either leaves or bark depending on the species involved. The other water soluble component is composed of a group of compounds such as tannin, chalcone, catechins and anthocyanidins. These compounds polymerize to form <b>methyl</b> hydroxy <b>chalcone</b> polymers (MHCP) which has been shown {{to play an important role}} in lowering blood sugar levels in Type ll diabetic individuals. It is said that MHCP has an ability to promote the phosphorylation process which in turn activates the beta-cells and thereby creating insulin activity that will then convert glucose into glycogen. Besides all health benefits of cinnamon, the plant contains a toxic compound, coumarin which impacts badly on animals resulting in death, and little information on its toxicity to human beings has been documented. Concerns arose about the possible presence of coumarin in these formulations, since these formulations are made from the cinnamon and the plant contains coumarin. This work has investigated the potential toxicity of coumarin from cinnamon powder and cinnamon formulation. The components from both cinnamon samples were extracted using various solvents according to their polarities and these compounds were screened on thin layer chromatography (TLC). The essential oil components were separated by column chromatography, and quantified by using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), all components (essential oil and water soluble) were identified by HPLC, and finally the characterization of the essential oil components was done with infrared (IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) whereas those of the water soluble were characterized by using liquid chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer (LC-MS) ...|$|R
40|$|Morusalbanol A (42) and sorocein B (62) are biologically active natural {{products}} isolated from moraceous plants. They are postulated to be biosynthetically derived from an intramolecular cyclization/ketalization of a cis-trans mulberry Diels-Alder adduct. Thus far, {{there has been}} no report on the synthesis of these compounds since their first isolation in 1991. A model studies on construction of the oxabicyclic [3. 3. 1] core of morusalbanol A was conducted prior to embarking on the synthesis of morusalbanol A and sorocein B. The results showed that the required cis-trans Diels-Alder precursors of morusalbanol A was obtained via the thermal cycloaddition reaction which was proven to be dependent on the presence of a hydrogen-bonded ortho OH substituent on the chalcones dienophile. Acid catalyzed intramolecular cyclization of a cis-trans Diels-Alder adduct (endo- 181) afforded the desired oxabicyclic [3. 3. 1] core of morusalbanol A in a stereocontrolled manner. Results from the model study have been applied to the synthesis of morusalbanol A (42). The requisite cis-trans Diels-Alder precursor (endo- 204) of morusalbanol A was successfully prepared via the thermal cycloaddition reaction between the <b>methyl</b> ether protected <b>chalcones</b> dienophile 88 and the dehydroprenyl diene 191. Selective removal of the ortho OMe group of the endo- 204 by using MgI 2 gave (±) morusalbanol A methyl ethers 206 and 207. A number of key proton and carbon signals in the NMR spectra of 206 and 207 were absent as a result of atroisomerism due to the rotational hindrance of the Diels-Alder-rings about the C 5 ´´- 15 ´´ and C 4 ´´-C 8 ´´-C 9 ´´ bond. Global demethylation on the (±) morusalbanol A methyl ethers 206 and 207 by using MgI 2, BCl 3, TMSI-quinoline was unsuccessful. An efficient method for preparing 2 ´ 2 -dimethyl- 2 H-chromones via Pd(II) -catalyzed Heck coupling of o-halophenols with 2 -methyl- 3 -buten- 2 -ol has been developed during the synthesis of sorocein B. The method is very general and can be useful to the synthesis of some natural 2 ´, 2 -dimethyl- 2 H-chromones. Similar strategy was used for construction of the cis-trans Diels-Alder precursor of sorocein B. The thermal cycloaddition reaction between chalcones dienophile 89 and dehydroprenyl diene 106 afforded the requisite cis-trans Diels-Alder precursor (endo- 241) in 35...|$|R
