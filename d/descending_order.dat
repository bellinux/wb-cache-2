50|$|Another {{method for}} testing the proper {{function}} of a nerve is Quantitative sensory testing (QST). QST relies on analysis of a patient's response to external stimuli of controlled intensity. A stimulus {{is applied to the}} skin of the nerve area being tested in ascending and <b>descending</b> <b>orders</b> of magnitude. Clinicians can quantify the mechanical sensitivity of the tactile stimulus using von Frey hairs or Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments. Also, weighted needles can be used to measure pin-prick sensation, and an electronic vibrameter is used to measure vibration sensitivity. Thermal stimuli are quantified by using a probe that operates on the Peltier principle.|$|R

Feature {{selection}} serves {{for both}} {{reduction of the}} total amount of available data (removing of valueless data) and improvement of the whole behavior of a given induction algorithm (removing data that cause deterioration of the results). A method of proper selection of features for an inductive algorithm is discussed. The main idea consists in proper <b>descending</b> <b>ordering</b> of features according to a measure of new information contributing to previous valuable set of features. The measure is based on comparing of statistical distributions of individual features including mutual correlation. A mathematical theory of the approach is described.

Each province had a local governing body consisting of a minister (Mahapradhana) and a treasurer (Bhandari) that reported to the ruler of that province (Dandanayaka). Under this local ruler were officials called Heggaddes and Gavundas who hired and supervised the local farmers and labourers recruited to till the land. Subordinate ruling clans such as Alupas continued to govern their respective territories while following the policies set by the empire.|$|E

Smaller regions of the oceans are called seas, gulfs, bays and other names. There are also salt lakes, which are smaller bodies of landlocked saltwater that are not interconnected with the World Ocean. Two notable examples of salt lakes are the Aral Sea and the Great Salt Lake.|$|E

The top ratings were AA-1 through AA-4 in <b>descending</b> <b>order,</b> although there was also a special AAA rating reserved for emergencies. Ratings AA-1 and AA-2 were for essential weapons and equipment, so Colonel Lucius D. Clay, the deputy chief of staff at Services and Supply for requirements and resources, felt that the highest rating he could assign was AA-3, although he was willing to provide a AAA rating on request for critical materials if the need arose. Nichols and Marshall were disappointed; AA-3 was the same priority as Nichols' TNT plant in Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|Natural thorium {{is usually}} almost pure 232Th, {{which is the}} longest-lived and most stable isotope of thorium, having a {{half-life}} comparable {{to the age of}} the universe. Its radioactive decay is the largest single contributor to the Earth's internal heat; the other major contributors are the shorter-lived primordial radionuclides, which are 238U, 40K, and 235U in <b>descending</b> <b>order</b> of their contribution. (At the time of the Earth's formation, 40K and 235U contributed much more by virtue of their short half-lives, but they have decayed more quickly, leaving the contribution from 232Th and 238U predominant.) The other natural thorium isotopes are much shorter-lived; of them, only 230Th is usually detectable, occurring in secular equilibrium with its parent 238U, and making up at most 0.04% of natural thorium.|$|E
