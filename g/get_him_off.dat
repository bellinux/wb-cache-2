5|$|Veronica {{talks to}} the ex-boyfriend before {{learning}} that the Kurt's best friend is probably guilty. Veronica gets a disturbing phone call from Logan, so she tracks his cell phone, finding him gambling. Veronica and Logan have a fight before she learns that Keith had to stop working for a client when Weevil hit a suspect; Keith feels required to fire Weevil. Veronica tells Weevil the news before {{she gives him a}} job fixing the Dean’s car. Veronica confronts the best friend, but he’s not the perpetrator, and Veronica suddenly realizes that Trish is. Veronica lies to Trish about what happened to Kurt in order to elicit a true reaction from her; this plan works, and Veronica learns that Trish took the playbook in order to <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>off</b> the team. However, she lost it in the process. Kurt, Trish, and Veronica track it down to the ex-boyfriend, who gave the plays to another team to spite the couple.|$|E

Veronica and Keith have another fight, with Veronica insulting his character {{for having a}} relationship with Harmony. Veronica and Meryl track the cell phone in the Fitzpatricks’ bar. Liam Fitzpatrick drunkenly picks up Veronica and carries her around, but Vinnie supposedly takes {{a picture of it}} to <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>off</b> her. Veronica and Meryl go to the police station and find that Sully washed up on shore after surfing with a bump on his head and had mild amnesia. While cleared, Mercer is still being held in custody. Keith rejects Harmony, and Logan nervously calls Keith for the whereabouts of Veronica. At the food court, Veronica is listening to voicemails from Logan and Keith when she notices an issue with her food. She returns to the counter with her plate, leaving her drink unattended. She returns to her seat but, after eating and drinking, soon feels disoriented. She recognizes this feelings as identical to her experience after ingesting GHB previously. Veronica attempts to get into her car and collapses just outside of it but she manages to set off the alarm. A mysterious figure appears and stops the alarm. There is a buzzing sound the scene cuts to a nearby Logan hearing the alarm. Logan finds Veronica's car with her unconscious on the ground next to it. He picks her up to reveal some locks of Veronica's hair on the ground and a bald spot {{on the back of her}} head.|$|E
500|$|Accompanied by {{his brother}} Peter, Hodgson {{walked out of the}} Royal Courts of Justice a free and {{innocent}} man after 27years of wrongful imprisonment. Hodgson's barrister at the 1982 trial, Robin Grey QC, was there to shake his hand as he was released. Grey said: [...] "As a human being I feel glad that we no longer have capital punishment. As a defence barrister I didn't <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>off,</b> and I have bitter feelings of guilt about that." ...|$|E

500|$|In one storyline, Aden loans {{money from}} [...] "shady bookie" [...] Clint Mailer (Matt Zeremes). Clint then forces Aden to throw {{football}} matches so Clint can win bets. Aden {{is described as}} being desperate for money so goes along with the plan. Geoff finds out and is [...] "appalled" [...] by Aden's behaviour, as the storyline progresses Clint tries {{to force him to}} end Geoff's career. Lasance added, [...] "Aden tries to <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>off</b> the field, but that backfires - and Geoff scores the winning try." [...] This results in Aden being badly assaulted by Clint.|$|E
500|$|As soon as {{he enters}} the {{interior}} of the Spirit, however, he is attacked by two frightened Russians, who he is forced to kill. As he continues to explore, he encounters a multitude of panicking Russians, all of whom attack him. He also finds several horrifically mutilated bodies, including that of the Ravenswoods captain, Lt. Lansing. Hansen soon learns of a creature known as an [...] "exocel", which was accidentally discovered by the crew of a Russian oil rig, the Star of Sakhalin, owned by Colonel Dmitriy Yusupov, a member of the Russian mafia, and staffed by Major Yuri Anischenko and his team of mercenaries. Yusupov came to realize the exocels were parasitic organisms, which used other living organisms as hosts, and as such, he brought Dr. Viktor Kamsky to the Sakhalin to begin experimenting with infecting various species with exocel serum. These experiments led to the discovery that exocels could re-animate recently deceased humans, and the creation of an antidote to counter infection. Hansen heads to the radio room to request help, but instead he is answered by Bennett, who tells him that Yusupov is on board and must be captured for questioning. Bennett tells Hansen that if he finds Yusupov, the CIA will <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>off</b> the ship.|$|E
500|$|Although Washington and {{his aides}} arrived from the command post at Harlem Heights soon after the landing began, {{they were unable to}} rally the {{retreating}} militia. About a mile (1.6km) inland from Kip's Bay, Washington rode his horse among the men, trying to turn them around and impose some order on them, cursing furiously and violently. By some accounts, he lost control of his temper; he brandished a cocked pistol and drew his sword, threatening to run men through and shouted, [...] "Take the walls! Take the cornfield!" [...] When no one obeyed, he threw his hat to the ground, exclaiming in disgust, [...] "Are these the men with which I am to defend America?" [...] When some fleeing men refused to turn and engage a party of advancing Hessians, Washington reportedly struck some of their officers with his riding crop. The Hessians shot or bayoneted a number of American troops who were trying to surrender. Two thousand Continental Army troops under the command of Generals Samuel Parsons and John Fellows arrived from the north, but {{at the sight of the}} chaotic militia retreat, they also turned and fled. Washington, still in a rage, rode within a hundred yards of the enemy before his aides managed to <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>off</b> the field. More and more British soldiers came ashore, including light infantry, grenadiers, and Hessian Jägers. They spread out, advancing in several directions. By late afternoon another 9,000 British troops had landed at Kip's Bay, and Howe had sent a brigade toward New York City, officially taking possession. While most of the Americans managed to escape to the north, not all got away. [...] "I saw a Hessian sever a rebel's head from his body and clap it on a pole in the entrenchments," [...] recorded a British officer. The southern advance pushed for a half mile (0.8km) to Watts farm (near present-day 23rd Street) before meeting stiff American resistance. The northern advance stopped at the Inclenberg (now Murray Hill, a rise west of Kip's Bay), just west of the present Lexington Avenue, under orders from General Howe to wait for the rest of the invading force. This was extremely fortunate for the thousands of American troops south of the invasion point. Had Clinton continued west to the Hudson he would have cut off General Putnam's troops, nearly one third of Washington's forces, from the main army, trapping them in lower Manhattan.|$|E

60|$|Captain Peters {{smiled to}} himself, {{as he made}} the entry. He was convinced, by the calm {{manner in which the}} admiral took it, that he more than {{suspected}} that the prisoner had escaped, and that James Walsham had had a hand in <b>getting</b> <b>him</b> <b>off.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Jason Holland testified he {{was drunk}} and lagging behind the others and did not see how the {{argument}} between his brother Micah and McLoren started. [...] As he entered, the two dropped their heads and started fighting. [...] Brandon Hein, 18, jumped into the fight, as did Jason, {{who says he was}} trying to get the bigger McLoren off his brother Micah's back. [...] Jason opened a folding pocketknife and [...] "pricked" [...] McLoren twice in the back to <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>off</b> his brother, then stabbed him in the chest. [...] When Farris entered the fort to help McLoren, Jason stabbed him twice and Hein punched him in the head and face. [...] McLoren survived his wounds but Farris died in the emergency room. [...] When Jason Holland learned from his mother that he was wanted for murder, he went into hiding but several weeks later voluntarily surrendered.|$|E
2500|$|... "I have a countryman of ours with me, who {{was pinned}} on me by {{our friends in}} London. I was ordered to put him into your hands, and I long for an {{opportunity}} to <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>off</b> my own. I don’t know if he was designed for my guide, but I find myself under a necessity of being his, for to take him out of his wooden world, he knows no more about travelling than a child of six. He is in a prodigious hurry to be at Dunkirk before Saturday. I wish to God he maybe soon wanted. He is in such haste that I was forced to go halves with him in hiring a packet boat at the rate of £5 on purpose to be almost “drounded,” or what was very near as extravagant a reason, to humour my fellow traveller, for we came over in so prodigious a storm that nothing but our light heads could have kept us from the bottom." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jones {{was born}} in 1933, on the South Side of Chicago, to Sarah Frances (née Wells) (1903–1999) and Quincy Delightt Jones Sr (1895–1971). The elder Jones was a semi-pro {{baseball}} player and carpenter from Kentucky; his paternal grandmother was an ex-slave in Louisville. They had gone to Chicago {{as part of the}} Great Migration out of the South. Sarah was a bank officer and apartment complex manager. Jones later discovered that his paternal grandfather, Jones, was Welsh. [...] Quincy had a younger brother, Lloyd, who later became an engineer for the Seattle television station KOMO-TV. Lloyd Jones died in 1998. Quincy was introduced to music by his mother, who always sang religious songs; and by his next-door neighbor, Lucy Jackson. When Jones was five or six, Jackson played stride piano next door, and he would always listen through the walls. Lucy Jackson recalled that after he heard her that one day, she could not <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>off</b> her piano if she tried.|$|E

50|$|As the starfish enlarges one of {{his legs}} over Tom's nose, they both of them do an {{impression}} of Jimmy Durante. After that, Tom tries to get the starfish off of his head by tugging <b>him</b> <b>off,</b> but doesn't succeed, much to Jerry's amusement. Tom eventually manages to get the starfish off to his head, but finds <b>him</b> <b>getting</b> stuck on his hands. Then he <b>gets</b> <b>him</b> <b>off</b> by pushing it with his foot and when he <b>gets</b> <b>him</b> <b>off,</b> he thinks he succeeds... until he starts walking and realizes he's now stuck on his foot. After realizing this, he pulls <b>him</b> <b>off</b> with his hands, but ends up <b>getting</b> <b>him</b> stuck on his head again. After that, Jerry whispers a plan in Tom's ear. As the starfish protests, Tom carries it out anyway: Running the headfirst into a big rock. The starfish is still here, and just as Tom cries {{and points to the}} rock and his head, a bump forms, causing the impact to push the starfish off.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2005, America Right talker Michael Savage {{stated that}} {{satellite}} radio should be censored by the Federal Communications Commission. Savage claimed that his lawyers {{were working on}} <b>getting</b> <b>him</b> <b>off</b> of both satellite services because he didn't want {{to be associated with}} the type of talk presented by hosts who frequently use obscene language. His show, [...] "The Savage Nation" [...] left the XM and Sirius lineups the following week.|$|R
2500|$|In 1922, {{while in}} Europe for General Patrick, Mitchell met the Italian air power theorist Giulio Douhet and soon {{afterwards}} an excerpted translation of Douhet's The Command of the Air began to circulate in the Air Service. In 1924, Gen. Patrick again dispatched him on an inspection tour, {{this time to}} Hawaii and Asia, to <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>off</b> the front pages. Mitchell {{came back with a}} 324-page report that predicted future war with Japan, including the attack on Pearl Harbor. Of note, Mitchell discounted the value of aircraft carriers in an attack on the Hawaiian Islands, believing they were of little practical use because they were incapable of operating effectively on the high seas, nor capable of delivering [...] "sufficient aircraft in the air at one time to insure a concentrated operation." [...] Mitchell believed instead, a surprise attack on the Hawaiian Islands would be conducted by land-based aircraft operating from islands in the Pacific. His report, published in 1925 as the book Winged Defense, foretold wider benefits of an investment in air power, believing it at the time, and for the future, [...] " [...] a dominating factor in the world's development", both for national defense and economic benefit. Winged Defense sold only 4,500copies between August 1925 and January 1926, the months surrounding the publicity of the court martial, and so Mitchell did not reach a wide audience.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2017, Jack Off Jill vocalist Jessicka Addams {{alleged that}} she was sexually {{assaulted}} by the band's bassist Twiggy Ramirez in their shared apartment while the pair were a couple in the mid-90s. She wrote on Facebook: [...] "He forced me on {{to the floor with}} his hand around my neck. I said NO. I said it so loud enough, that my friend Pete came rushing in from the other room to <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>off</b> of me. But I had been raped. I had been raped by somebody I thought I loved." [...] Manson responded: [...] "I knew Jessicka and Twiggy had a romantic relationship many years ago and I considered and still consider Jessicka to be a friend. I knew nothing about these allegations until very recently and am saddened by Jessicka's obvious distress." [...] Soon after, Manson announced on Twitter that Twiggy had been fired from the band. Several days later, Twiggy said in a statement: [...] "I have only recently been made aware of these allegations from over 20 years ago. I do not condone non-consensual sex of any kind. I will be taking some time to spend with my family and focus on maintaining my several years of sobriety. If I have caused anyone pain, I apologize and truly regret it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 2003 {{event was}} {{disrupted}} by a defrocked priest, Cornelius Horan, who ran onto the Hangar Straight {{during the race}} while cars were coming at him at 160+ mph. Marshals were able to <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>off</b> the track before he hurt himself or anyone else and he was later arrested; Brazilian Rubens Barrichello won the race for Ferrari. A dispute between Silverstone's owners, the British Racing Drivers' Club (BRDC), and the Formula One authorities in 2003 over the funding of necessary improvements to the track's facilities led to doubts {{over the future of}} the race. In October 2004 the British Grand Prix was left off the preliminary race schedule for 2005 because the BRDC refused to pay the race fee demanded by Bernie Ecclestone. However, after months of negotiation between the BRDC, Ecclestone and the Formula One constructors, a deal was made for the Grand Prix to be held at Silverstone until 2009. 2008 saw Briton Lewis Hamilton win for McLaren; and on 4 July, it was announced that Donington Park had been awarded the contract to host the British Grand Prix for 10 years from 2010. However, Donington failed to secure the necessary funding to host the race, and its contract was terminated in November 2009. On 7 December 2009, Silverstone signed a 17-year contract to host the British Grand Prix from 2010 onwards. The 2010 race saw a new circuit configuration being used, using the brand new [...] "Arena" [...] layout. For 2011 a new pit complex was built between Club and Abbey Corners, to where the start/finish line was moved. Silverstone is still a very fast circuit- with average speeds up in the 145mph range for Formula 1 cars; one of the highest average speeds on the F1 calendar.|$|E

Bit by bit he admits that the problem was the gin shipment, knowing that his boss is a mortal enemy of the gin drinker.
