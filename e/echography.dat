40|$|Background: Endobronchial {{ultrasonography}} (EBUS) {{has been}} applied as a routine procedure for the diagnostic of hiliar and mediastinal nodes. The authors assessed {{the relationship between the}} echographic appearance of mediastinal nodes, based on endobronchial ultrasound images, and the likelihood of malignancy.; Methods: The images of twelve malignant and eleven benign nodes were evaluated. A previous processing method was applied {{to improve the quality of}} the images and to enhance the details. Texture and morphology parameters analyzed were: the image texture of the <b>echographies</b> and a fractal dimension that expressed the relationship between area and perimeter of the structures that appear in the image, and characterizes the convoluted inner structure of the hiliar and mediastinal nodes.; Results: Processed images showed that relationship between log perimeter and log area of hilar nodes was lineal (i. e. perimeter vs. area follow a power law). Fractal dimension was lower in the malignant nodes compared with non-malignant nodes (1. 47 (0. 09), 1. 53 (0. 10) mean(SD), Mann-Whitney U test p < 0. 05)).; Conclusion: Fractal dimension of ultrasonographic images of mediastinal nodes obtained through endobronchial ultrasound differ in malignant nodes from non-malignant.

Our work compares the data in the literature regarding diagnostic accuracy of the technique and results of routine use of the technique in two centers in Piedmont. Material and methods: 77 reports ultrasound with the final diagnosis of rectal cancer from the period 2008 – 2012 were examined. The <b>echographies</b> were performed by two experienced operators, using two ultrasound device with the same technical characteristics. Results: Sensitivity levels are high, {{with the exception of}} stage T 3. Specificity is always high. The relationships of verisimilitude, both negative and positive, showing that the accuracy of the test is still high. The risk of overstaging is higher for pT 1, while most important the risk of understaging concerns the stage T 3 (23. 5 %); on the contrary the ERU is able to exclude infiltration of perirectal organs with a good accuracy (NPV of 99. 3 %).

Design: Prospective, observational,descriptive study. Method: We performed anultrasound of the vitreous of patients elegiblefor refractive surgery. Vitreous Changes weremeasured by video B scan ultrasonographybefore {{and at the}} first and third month after Lasikat Fundación Oftalmológica Nacional betweenJune 2002 and March 2003. Results: A total of 16 patients, 67 % women, 33 % men, mean ageof 31. 6 years (range between 22 and 40 years). A total of 29 eyes were studied, 16 right and 13 left for a total of 87 <b>echographies.</b> The refractiveerrors in a range of - 10. 50 and + 3. 50 of sphericalequivalent. There were 24 myopic and 5 hypermetropic eyes. The vitreous changes correspondedto a posterior vitreous detachment(PVD) and the presence of opacities in thevitreous. At the beginning of the study 18 eyes(62 %) had evidenced PVD and all of the 29 eyes(100 %) had opacities; At the end of the controls changes were evidenced in 22 eyes (81 %), thevitreous opacities increased in 14 eyes (48. 27 %),while they remained without changes in 15 eyes(51. 7 %). The presence of newly developed PVDwas documented in 10 eyes (30 %), there was anincrease of PVD in 8 eyes (27. 5 %), and in onecase we observed the presence of a traction areaat the vitreoretinal interfase that correspondedto 3. 4 % of the eyes studied; it was an hypermetropicpatient in whom ophthalmoscopically,after the echographic findings, we evidenced twooperculated like retinal holes that requiredtreatment with laser. Conclusions: We demostratedthat true changes are evidenced at thevitreous post Lasik. Posterior vitreous detachmentis the most significant discovery and itcould be implied in the genesis of tears anddetachment of the retina, but its incidence is evensmaller than in the general population and thisallows refractive surgery to remain as a safeprocedure, even though we suggest patientsfollow a dilated indirect fundoscopy examinationbefore and after Lasi...|$|R

A total of 52 patients (chronic pancreatitis (42); pancreatic cysts (three); and carcinoma of the pancreas (seven)) were studied and the results compared with those from other diagnostic techniques. In 65 7 % of chronic pancreatitis patients, and in all cases of carcinoma of the pancreas, <b>echography</b> provided evidence of pancreatic abnormality but in no case could an un-ambiguous diagnosis of the disease be made.

40|$|Purpose: To {{correlate}} clinical {{findings of}} Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease with standardized <b>echography</b> findings in a cross-sectional, descriptive and observational study. Methods: Patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada {{disease in the}} convalescent and recurrence phases were evaluated with standardized ocular <b>echography.</b> Eyes with opaque media were excluded. Clinical findings were correlated with echographic data. Results: Thirty-seven eyes of 25 patients were included. Best corrected visual acuity was in average 20 / 100 (0. 70 logMAR). Clinical findings included: sunset glow fundus (92 %), pigment migration (92 %), nummular chorioretinal depigmented scars (68 %) and subretinal fibrosis (64. 8 %). Standardized <b>echography</b> was able to recognize all the cases with subretinal fibrosis (n= 24) described clinically. Standardized <b>echography</b> showed a 100 % sensitivity and specificity of finding subretinal fibrosis. Subretinal fibrosis in patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada represents {{a risk factor for}} low vision. In our patients&# 8217; eyes, presence of subretinal fibrosis had a 2. 5 time relative risk of having a visual acuity equal or worst to 20 / 70. Conclusions: Standardized <b>echography</b> represents a useful tool in patients with VKH in the chronic (convalescence and recurrence) phase of the disease. Subretinal fibrosis, a sight threatening complication in the convalescence and recurrent phases of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada, can be diagnosed with ocular <b>echography,</b> with characteristic images.
