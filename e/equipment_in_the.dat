5|$|Alvarez {{proposed}} Muon tomography in 1965 {{to search}} the Egyptian pyramids for unknown chambers. Using naturally occurring cosmic rays, his scheme was to place spark chambers, standard <b>equipment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> high-energy particle physics of this time, beneath the second pyramid of Chephren in a known chamber. By measuring the counting rate of the cosmic rays in different directions the detector would reveal the existence of any void in the overlaying rock structure.|$|E

The method for allocating a device-to-device (D 2 D) communications resource <b>in</b> <b>the</b> present invention comprises: a first network device receiving device-to-device (D 2 D) communications capabilities sent by user <b>equipments</b> <b>in</b> coverage; <b>the</b> first network device sending, according to the communications capabilities, a resource identification to each of <b>the</b> user <b>equipments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coverage of the first network device in a D 2 D group, the D 2 D group comprising at least two user equipments; and the first network device sending a resource allocation message, the resource allocation message carrying D 2 D communication resource allocation information corresponding to <b>the</b> resource identification. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> embodiments {{of the present}} invention, by allocating a same resource identification to user <b>equipments</b> <b>in</b> a D 2 D communications group, and using a same resource allocation message to carry resource allocation information corresponding to the resource identification, signaling overheads are reduced and the allocation efficiency is improved {{in a process of}} allocating resources used in a discovery stage and resources used in a communication stage to <b>the</b> user <b>equipments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> D 2 D group...|$|R
5|$|At first, USB was {{considered}} a complement to IEEE 1394 (FireWire) technology, which {{was designed as a}} high-bandwidth serial bus that efficiently interconnects peripherals such as disk drives, audio interfaces, and video <b>equipment.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> initial design, USB operated at a far lower data rate and used less sophisticated hardware. It was suitable for small peripherals such as keyboards and pointing devices.|$|E

No further debate took place, and on 15 December Churchill informed Curtin that shipping would be made available in late January to transport the division and a small portion of its equipment to Australia.|$|E
5|$|Die casting {{equipment}} {{was invented in}} 1838 {{for the purpose of}} producing movable type for the printing industry. The first die casting-related patent was granted in 1849 for a small hand-operated machine for the purpose of mechanized printing type production. In 1885 Otto Mergenthaler invented the linotype machine, an automated type-casting device which became the prominent type of <b>equipment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> publishing industry. The Soss die-casting machine, manufactured in Brooklyn, NY, was the first machine to be sold in the open market in North America. Other applications grew rapidly, with die casting facilitating the growth of consumer goods and appliances by making affordable the production of intricate parts in high volumes. In 1966, General Motors released the Acurad process.|$|E
5|$|During the Mission Status briefing, Lead Flight Director Tony Ceccacci {{noted that}} during the camera survey of the <b>equipment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> payload bay, the team noticed some fine {{particulate}} matter around the box containing the Wide Field Camera 3 and asked the crew to take additional images using a higher resolution camera for the ground teams to assess. Cain later confirmed that the dust was not present prior to launch, and was most likely particulate shaken loose from the thick insulation blankets inside the payload bay during launch. The team advised the crew to avoid the particulate {{as much as possible}} during the spacewalks, and use caution when working around the container to avoid the debris, {{but it was not a}} significant concern.|$|E

5|$|For {{exceptionally}} meritorious {{conduct in}} the performance of outstanding service while serving on board the U.S.S. TRITON from 16 February 1960 to 10 May 1960. As Commanding Officer, Captain Edward L. Beach, United States Navy, led his crew with courage, foresight and determination in an unprecedented circumnavigation of the globe, proving man's ability under trying conditions to accomplish prolonged submerged missions as well as testing new and complex <b>equipment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world's largest submarine. This historic voyage took his ship into strange waters under difficult and frequently unknown conditions, as a result, the TRITON collected much valuable oceanographic information. Captain Beach's sound judgment, masterful leadership, professional skill and devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the naval service.|$|E
5|$|For {{her maiden}} voyage in June 1861, Amazon sailed to Five Islands {{to take on}} a cargo of timber for passage across the Atlantic to London. After supervising the ship's loading, Captain McLellan fell ill; his {{condition}} worsened, and Amazon returned to Spencer's Island where McLellan died on June 19. John Nutting Parker took over as captain, and resumed the voyage to London, in the course of which Amazon encountered further misadventures. She collided with fishing <b>equipment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> narrows off Eastport, Maine, and after leaving London ran into and sank a brig in the English Channel.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, Kenyatta {{moved to}} Narok, {{where he was}} {{involved}} in transporting livestock to Nairobi, possibly as an administrative clerk or a ranching hand. After the British Army conquered German East Africa, Kenyatta relocated to Nairobi where he worked in a store selling farming and engineering <b>equipment.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> evenings, he took classes in a Church Mission School. Several months later he returned to Thika to work with another company, and then gained employment constructing houses for the Thogota Mission. He also lived for a time in Dagoretti, where he became a retainer for a local sub-chief, Kioi; in 1919 he assisted Kioi in putting the latter's case in a land dispute before a Nairobi court.|$|E

North Korean and US forces unexpectedly ran into one another and a confused battle ensued. American forces were better equipped with heavy weapons and armor thanks to newly arrived <b>equipment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country, and their better ground during the battle allowed them to repel North Korean advances.|$|E
5|$|Tennessee Eastman {{was hired}} to manage Y-12. Y-12 {{initially}} enriched the uranium-235 content to between 13% and 15%, and shipped the first few hundred grams of this to Los Alamos laboratory in March 1944. Only 1 part in 5,825 of the uranium feed emerged as final product. The rest was splattered over <b>equipment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process. Strenuous recovery efforts helped raise production to 10% of the uranium-235 feed by January 1945. In February the Alpha racetracks began receiving slightly enriched (1.4%) feed from the new S-50 thermal diffusion plant. The next month it received enhanced (5%) feed from the K-25 gaseous diffusion plant. By April 1945 K-25 was producing uranium sufficiently enriched to feed directly into the Beta tracks.|$|E
