25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that in contrast to Cubist painters, Cubist sculptors did not create a new art of 'space-time'. Unlike a flat painting, high-relief sculpture from its volumetric nature could never be limited to a single view-point. Hence, as Peter Collins highlights, it <b>is</b> <b>absurd</b> to state that Cubist sculpture, like painting, was not limited to a single point of view.|$|E
25|$|But, second, {{not only}} can we {{not know that the}} {{objective}} world is nonmentalistic, we also cannot intelligibly suppose that it could be material. To conceive of a dualism entails attributing material properties to the objective world. However, this presupposes that we could observe that the objective world has material properties. But this <b>is</b> <b>absurd,</b> for whatever is observed must ultimately be the content of our own consciousness, and consequently, nonmaterial.|$|E
25|$|Many Jewish {{scholars}} such as Rabbi Saadia Gaon, Rabbi Bahya ibn Paquda, and Rabbi Yehuda Halevi have elaborated on {{the issues}} of idolatry. One of the oft-cited discussions is the commentary of Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon (Maimonides) on idolatry. According to the Maimonidean interpretation, idolatry in itself is not a fundamental sin, but the grave sin is the belief that God can be corporeal. In the Jewish belief, the only image of God is man, one who lives and thinks; God has no visible shape, and it <b>is</b> <b>absurd</b> to make or worship images; instead man must worship the invisible God alone.|$|E

25|$|Granting {{the strict}} logical {{consistency}} of post-Cantorian, axiomatized infinite set theory, Craig {{concludes that the}} existence of an actually infinite number of things is metaphysically impossible due to the consequential absurdities that arise. Craig illustrates this point using the example of Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel. In Hilbert's hypothetical fully occupied hotel with infinitely many rooms, one can add an additional guest in room #1 by moving the guest in room #1 to room #2, the guest in room #2 into room #3, the guest in room #3 into room #4 and continue the shifting of rooms out to infinity. Craig points out that it <b>is</b> <b>absurd</b> to add an additional guest to a fully occupied hotel and the absurd result that the hotel has the same number of guests, infinity, both before after adding the additional guest. Stating that the mathematical conventions stipulated to ensure the logical consistency of this type of transfinite arithmetic have no ontological force, Craig concludes that finitism is most plausibly true, which means that the series of past events in the universe must be finite, so it must have had a beginning.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the nuclear}} {{stalemate}} became apparent, the Governments of East and West {{have adopted the}} policy which Mr. Dulles calls 'brinkmanship'. This is a policy adapted from a sport which, I am told, is practiced by some youthful degenerates. This sport is called 'Chicken!'. It is played by choosing a long straight road with a white line down the middle and starting two very fast cars towards each other from opposite ends. Each car is expected to keep the wheels {{on one side of}} the white line. As they approach each other, mutual destruction becomes more and more imminent. If one of them swerves from the white line before the other, the other, as he passes, shouts 'Chicken!', and the one who has swerved becomes an object of contempt. As played by irresponsible boys, this game is considered decadent and immoral, though only the lives of the players are risked. But when the game is played by eminent statesmen, who risk not only their own lives but those of many hundreds of millions of human beings, it is thought on both sides that the statesmen on one side are displaying a high degree of wisdom and courage, and only the statesmen on the other side are reprehensible. This, of course, <b>is</b> <b>absurd.</b> Both are to blame for playing such an incredibly dangerous game. The game may be played without misfortune a few times, but sooner or later it will come to be felt that loss of face is more dreadful than nuclear annihilation. The moment will come when neither side can face the derisive cry of 'Chicken!' from the other side. When that moment is come, the statesmen of both sides will plunge the world into destruction.|$|E

Granted that the outlook and the engraving style were Bewick's, and that these were notable contributions, {{the fact that the}} results were so close to his own points more to an effective method of illustration than to the outpourings of genius."

500|$|In India the film's {{reception}} was enthusiastic. The Times of India wrote, [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>absurd</b> {{to compare}} it with any other Indian cinema... Pather Panchali is pure cinema". Chief Minister Roy arranged a special screening in Calcutta for Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, {{who came out of}} the theatre impressed. Despite opposition from some within the governments of West Bengal and India because of its depiction of poverty, Pather Panchali was sent to the 1956 Cannes Film Festival with Nehru's personal approval. It was screened {{towards the end of the}} festival, coinciding with a party given by the Japanese delegation, and only a small number of critics attended. Although some were initially unenthusiastic at the prospect of yet another Indian melodrama, the film critic Arturo Lanocita found [...] "the magic horse of poetry... invading the screen". Pather Panchali was subsequently named Best Human Document at the festival.|$|E

500|$|Long's most {{effective}} tactic against Roosevelt, however, {{was not to}} argue biological matters, but to attack the President's motives in becoming involved in such a debate. In reference to Roosevelt's published works describing his hunting expeditions, Long wrote: [...] "I find after carefully reading two of his big books that every time he gets near {{the heart of a}} wild thing he invariably puts a bullet through it." [...] The Boston Globe published an article titled [...] "President a Slayer Not Lover of Animals", while the same missive was called [...] "Long Will Combat Roosevelt Until Latter is Whipped" [...] in Philadelphia's Public Ledger; in it, Long wrote: [...] "Roosevelt is a man who takes savage delight in whooping through the woods killing everything in sight."

500|$|Reception of Knight's {{idea in the}} {{mainstream}} media has been mixed. Writing in the San Francisco Chronicle, Gregory Dicum states that there is an [...] "undeniable logic" [...] to VHEMT's arguments, but he doubts whether Knight's ideas can succeed, arguing that many people desire to have children and cannot be dissuaded. Stephen Jarvis echoes this skepticism in The Independent, noting that VHEMT faces great difficulty owing to the basic human reproductive drive. At The Guardians website, Guy Dammann applauds the movement's aim as [...] "in many ways laudable", but argues that it <b>is</b> <b>absurd</b> to believe that humans will voluntarily seek extinction. Freelance writer Abby O'Reilly writes that since having children is frequently viewed as a measure of success, VHEMT's goal is difficult to attain. Knight contends in response to these arguments that though sexual desire is natural, human desire for children is a product of enculturation.|$|E

To be sure she <b>is</b> <b>absurd</b> sometimes and has her humours. But there are such things more or less in all families." [...] The couple, while living quietly, enjoyed entertaining, with Mrs. Jordan writing in late 1809: [...] "We shall have a full and merry house this Christmas, 'tis what the dear Duke delights in." [...] George III was accepting of his son's relationship with the actress (though recommending that he halve her allowance); in 1797, he created William Ranger of Bushy Park, which included a large residence, Bushy House, for William's growing family. William used Bushy as his principal residence until he became king. His London residence, Clarence House, was constructed to the designs of John Nash between 1825 and 1827.|$|E
500|$|With a {{loan from}} the West Bengal government, Ray finally {{completed}} the film. It was released in 1955 to great critical and popular success. It earned numerous prizes and had long runs in both India and abroad. In India, {{the reaction to the}} film was enthusiastic; The Times of India wrote that [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>absurd</b> to compare it with any other Indian cinema [...] Pather Panchali is pure cinema." [...] In the United Kingdom, Lindsay Anderson wrote a glowing review of the film. But, the reaction was not uniformly positive. After watching the movie, François Truffaut is reported to have said, [...] "I don't want to see a movie of peasants eating with their hands." [...] Bosley Crowther, then the most influential critic of The New York Times, wrote a scathing review of the film. Its American distributor Ed Harrison was worried Crowther's review would dissuade audiences, but the film had an exceptionally long run when released in the United States.|$|E
