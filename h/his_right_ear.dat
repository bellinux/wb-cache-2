A passerby testified to having stopped to help Frank, and saw Frank try to speak, but he died where he fell, before he could be moved.|$|E

These two try to track down Karera for reasons relating to the Rokakaka tree. They also seem to know Josefumi Kujo, as they are surprised at how Soft & Wet's abilities are similar to his. They fight both Josuke and Karera, and Josuke appears to be outnumbered until Karera returns after being set on fire by their original attack. Josuke manages to steal the poison gas within the soccer ball, stopping their combination attack, and then Karera uses Love Love Deluxe to grow hair around them to set on fire. While they are distracted by the flames, Josuke unleashes the poison he stole earlier, killing both of them and reducing them to rubble.|$|R

Welsh had spent $150,000 on Long Hill, his entire life's earnings, and he {{placed it on the}} market for $20,000 cash as his business was close to collapse. He was still unable to find a buyer.

On 11 October 1919, Welsh was the only diner in a restaurant on 50th and Broadway, when by complete coincidence Harry Pollok walked in. The men became violent, and a fight ensued which ended with Pollok being rushed to the Polyclinic Hospital with half <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>ear</b> in an ice bucket. Pollok swore out a warrant against Welsh who was arrested upon complaint that he had bitten his former manager's ear in half. Welsh denied the charges and after Pollok failed to appear to press the charge for a third time, the case was dismissed.|$|E

50|$|The Veteran appealed a Board of Veterans Appeals {{decision}} that determined that new and material evidence {{had not been}} submitted to reopen <b>his</b> claim for <b>right</b> <b>ear</b> hearing loss and that denied his claim for service connection for tinnitus. The Veteran served on active duty from December 1943 to September 1945. The VA Regional Office denied his original claim for service connection for hearing loss of the <b>right</b> <b>ear</b> in 1945 {{on the basis that}} the condition was not found on his discharge examination and there was no in-service treatment for the condition. In 1998, the Veteran filed a reopened claim and a new claim for tinnitus. He was scheduled for an examination in April 1999 and diagnosed with hearing loss and tinnitus. He attended a hearing at the Regional Office in May 1999 and testified regarding his in-service noise exposure and experience of having had ringing in his ears during and since service.
