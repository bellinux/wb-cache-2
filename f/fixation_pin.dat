This study sought to biomechanically evaluate construct strength using self-drilling (SD) and self-tapping (ST) pins inserted with either bicortical or unicortical fixation. SD and ST 5. 0 mm stainless steel pins were used in combination with bicortical self-drilling (BCSD), bicortical self-tapping (BCST), unicortical self-drilling (UCSD), and unicortical selftapping (UCST) techniques. Pre-drilling for the self-tapping pins was completed with a 4. 0 mm drill bit using ¾ inch polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe as the insertional medium. The PVC pin constructs were then loaded to failure in a cantilever bending method using a mechanical testing system. Ten trials of each technique were analyzed. BCSD insertion technique had the highest maximum failure force and stiffness of all tested techniques (P< 0. 0001). SD pins were significantly stronger to bending forces than ST pins in both the unicortical and bicortical setting (P< 0. 0001). Three point bending tests of the 5. 0 mm SD and ST threaded area showed that threaded portion of the SD pins had a 300 N greater maximum failure force than the ST pins. Biomechanical analysis of external <b>fixation</b> <b>pin</b> insertion techniques demonstrates that bicortical fixation with SD pins achieved the greatest resistance to bending load.

30|$|Pin or wire {{colonisation}} by bacteria starts {{during surgery}} {{or in the}} early postoperative period and {{has been described as}} occurring in steps [19, 20]. Immediately after insertion of the wire or pin, plasma proteins rapidly coat the surface of the <b>fixation</b> <b>pin</b> implant [21]. The current belief is that the initial interaction between bacteria and the adsorbed proteins is probably non-specific, occurring through a combination of Van der Waals, gravitational and Coulombic forces [22]. Membrane proteins and polysaccharides subsequently allow the bacteria to bind firmly to the proteins on the device surfaces. Finally, certain bacterial species secrete a protective exopolysaccharide layer—the biofilm—which renders them resistant to antibiotics [23, 24]. Biofilm-related bacterial infections are recognised as being exceedingly difficult to treat with conventional systemic antibiotic therapies [24], thus validating the promising strategy of seeking to inhibit bacterial adhesion prior to biofilm formation.|$|E

40|$|Pin tract {{infection}} is a prevalent complication in treatments with external fixation. This {{study focused on}} the external fixation utilized for the knee joint distraction treatment. In a previous study initiated by the UMC Utrecht 85 % of the patients got at least one pin tract infection during this treatment. A pin tract {{infection is}} caused by bacteria (mainly staphylococci) that form a biofilm {{on the surface of}} the external <b>fixation</b> <b>pin.</b> Currently, antibiotics are used to treat pin tract infections. High doses of antibiotics are needed to resolve a biofilm. Prevention of biofilm development is necessary to minimize the antibiotic use. The literature suggested that a small electric current could have an influence on the biofilm formation and therewith the chance of infection. The first aim of this study was to investigate the effect of three different current heights (20, 100 and 500 µA) on the bacteria on the surface of external fixation pins. The secondary aim was to develop a wearable device for the knee joint distraction treatment that could deliver this current to the pin tract. Results from the experiments showed that: it was possible to form a starting biofilm in 24 hours with Staphylococcus aureus on an external <b>fixation</b> <b>pin</b> and an electric current decreases the amount of viable bacteria on the pin and in the fluid surrounding it. The amplitude of the current had an influence on the extent to which the bacteria were killed. The ratio of viable bacteria {{on the surface of the}} anode pins was: 1 out of 18 (20 µA), 1 out of 200 (100 µA) and 1 out of 11 (500 µA). On the surface of the cathode pins this was: the same as control (20 µA), 1 out of 12 (100 µA) and zero (500 µA). In the fluids the ratio of viable bacteria were: 1 out of 9 (20 µA), 1 out of 10. 000 (100 µA) and 1 out of 100. 000 (500 µA). A different process was observed on the anode pins than on the cathode pins. A current of 500 µA was used in the developed prototypes of a wearable device. One of the two prototypes tested in-vitro, successfully killed bacteria and prevented biofilm formation on the surface of the external fixator pins. The developed wearable device has the potential to make pin tract infection a rare complication during the use of external fixation for the knee joint distraction treatment.

30|$|The Checketts–Otterburn PTI {{classification}} {{is commonly}} used {{as a guide to}} decision-making because it provides valuable information regarding treatment [34]. This classification distinguishes between two groups of PTI—minor (grades 1 – 3) and major (grades 4 – 6)—with the main difference being that the external <b>fixation</b> <b>pin</b> has to be removed in cases of major infection (see Table 1). Although PTI is common, very few cases lead to major complications, and most PTI are mild and may therefore respond to increased local pin site care. It is thus legitimate and safe to start treatment of a grade 1 PTI by increasing the frequency of local cleaning and dressing changes; it is also advisable to use more absorbent dressings in cases with excessive exudate. Hydrofibres can absorb large amounts of wound fluids, including exudate with bacteria. This is then transformed into a soft gel which creates a moist environment to support the body’s healing process. Furthermore, silver-releasing dressings have been proven to be as effective as oral antibiotics for controlling PTI; they could thus constitute the first-line therapy [78]. For a grade 2 Checketts–Otterburn PTI, not only should pin site care be improved, but patients should be treated with a course of oral antibiotics. Swabbing of the infected pin site is advised before initiating 7 – 10  days of oral antibiotics aimed at S. aureus. If the PTI resolves within that 7 - to 10 -day course of antibiotic, the medication can be discontinued, and regular pin site care may be resumed. A patient with grade 3 Checketts–Otterburn PTI should be admitted to hospital for intravenous antibiotics, inpatient pin site care and limb elevation. If these grade 3 PTI do not respond adequately to treatment, the pins or wires involved should be removed and changed, but external fixation can continue.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{determine}} the outcomes in patients who underwent conversion from an external fixator to an internal fixation device. This is a retrospective review of 18 patients (24 limbs) who underwent conversion from external to internal fixation. The patients had external fixators applied for traumatic bone defects or congenital deformities. Conversion to internal fixation was performed for reasons of patient dissatisfaction with external <b>fixation,</b> <b>pin</b> track sepsis, persistent non-union or refracture. The complexity of cases was graded using Paley’s level of difficulty score. Patients were either converted acutely or delayed. Internal fixation devices were either intramedullary nails or plate and screws. Outcome was regarded as excellent if the patients were fully weight-bearing and pain-free on a mechanically well-aligned limb and without need for further surgery: good if the patient required subsequent surgery to achieve union and poor if irreversible complications occurred. Acute conversions (fixator removal and introduction of internal fixation device at same surgery) were done in 19 limbs and delayed conversion (interval between fixator removal and internal fixation) in 5. In the acute group, 17 limbs (89. 4 %) had at least a good outcome, 16 of these limbs had an excellent result. Two limbs (10. 6 %) had a poor result and required amputation. Both cases were after acute conversion to intramedullary nails; the original presenting diagnosis was of an infected non-union of the tibia and both had Paley scores above 7. In the delayed conversion group, all limbs (100 %) had at least a good outcome, with 4 limbs (80 %) having an excellent result. The mean external fixator time was 185 days (61 – 370). Both the cases with poor outcomes had longer external fixation times. This series supports the practice of conversion of external fixation to internal fixation with the majority of patients attaining good results. It identifies that plate devices appear to produce fewer deep sepsis complications, as compared to intramedullary nails, particularly when the original presenting diagnosis is a septic non-union.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{literature}} research and clinical studies are presented to assist physicians {{in the decision}} making process for surgical treatment of dislocated midshaft clavicle fractures (DMCF). In Chapter 1 an introduction is given regarding the background, aim and outline of this thesis. Chapter 2 is a systematic review comparing plate fixation and intramedullary fixation for DMCF. The quality of evidence of each included study is evaluated using two different quality-scoring systems. All four included studies report {{no significant difference in}} function or complications. Despite the limited number and low quality of the available studies, there is no difference in shoulder function between patients treated with plate fixation or intramedullary fixation for DMCF. Chapter 3 specifically focuses on the complications after plate fixation. Another literature search is performed and a total of eleven studies are found. Quality tools are used to qualify the included studies. Complications are divided into two groups: major and minor complications. Only three studies are of high quality evidence. With regards to major complications plate fixation is a safe treatment option for DMCF but implant related complications are relatively frequent. In Chapter 4 the same approach is used to assess the complications following intramedullary fixation for DMCF. A total of six studies are included and analyzed. This chapter shows that intramedullary fixation is a safe treatment option for DMCF. The advantage of intramedullary fixation is that revision or removal of the implant can be performed minimally invasive with small incisions and short operating times. Minor complications (medial protrusion) occur frequently. As a result of routine implant removal, treatment with intramedullary fixation requires an additional surgical procedure. In Chapter 5 a retrospective comparison of plate fixation and intramedullary fixation using a titanium elastic nail (TEN) is presented focussing on complications. Records of 90 patients who were treated with either plate fixation or intramedullary fixation are reviewed and complications are reported. This chapter shows a tendency towards more major complications (implant failure and refracture after implant removal) after plate fixation in comparison with intramedullary fixation. Minor complications (medial protrusion) are more frequent after intramedullary fixation. After comprehensive literature and retrospective research for the optimal surgical treatment of DMCF, Chapter 6 presents the rationale and design of a multicentre prospective randomized trial comparing plate fixation with intramedullary <b>fixation</b> (<b>pin</b> or plate: POP-study). Short-term results of the POP-study are presented in Chapter 7. A total of 120 patients were included and treated according to block-randomization with either plate fixation or intramedullary fixation using TEN. Operative time, post-operative pain, shoulder function scores and complications were documented up until six weeks post-operatively. This chapter reports better functional results of the shoulder six weeks postoperatively favouring plate fixation. More complications are seen in the TEN-group but the time of surgery is significantly shorter.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Twenty peri-implant box-shaped bone defects were created in 10 pig mandibles. Every bone defect was augmented once with each of the following GBR procedures: Granulate (particulated xenograft + collagen membrane), Granulate + Pins (particulated xenograft + collagen membrane + <b>fixation</b> <b>pins),</b> and Block (block xenograft + collagen membrane). Cone-beam computed tomography scans were obtained prior and after blinded wound closure. The horizontal thickness (HT) of the augmented region (bone substitute + membrane) was assessed at the implant shoulder (HT 0 mm) and at 1 - 5 mm apical to the implant shoulder (HT 1 mm -HT 5 mm). The changes of HT during flap suturing were calculated as absolute (mm) and relative values (%). Repeated-measures ANOVA was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS Wound closure induced a statistically significant change of HT 0 mm and of HT 1 mm in all the treatment groups (P ≤ 0. 05). The change in HT 0 mm measured - 42. 8 ± 17. 9 % (SD) for Granulate, - 22. 9 ± 21. 2 % (SD) for Granulate + Pins, and - 20. 2 ± 18. 9 % (SD) for Block. The reduction in HT 0 mm, HT 1 mm, HT 2 mm, and HT 3 mm for the Granulate procedure was significantly higher as compared to the Granulate + Pins and the Block procedures (P ≤ 0. 05). There were no statistically significant differences in the change of HT between the Granulate + Pins and the Block procedures (P > 0. 05). CONCLUSION Wound closure induced displacement of the bone substitute resulting in a partial collapse of the collagen membrane in the coronal portion of the augmented site.

Stainless steel <b>fixation</b> <b>pins</b> are coated with crystalline TiO 2 by cathodic arc evaporation forming the bioactive layer for biomimetic deposition of Tobramycin con-taining HA. Tobramycin is either introduced by co-precipitation during HA formation or by adsorption-loading after HA deposition. The samples containing antibiotics are inserted into bone mimicking polyethylene foam after which the drug release is monitored using high performance liquid chromatography. This analysis shows that HA coating wear and delamination significantly decrease the amount of drug released during initial burst, but only marginally influence the sustained release period. Spalled coating fragments are found to remain within the synthetic bone material structure. The presence of HA within this structure supports {{the assumption that the}} local release of Tobramycin is not only ex-pected to eliminate bacteria growth directly at the pin interface but as well at some distance from the implant. Further-more, no negative effect of gamma sterilization could be observed on the drug release profile. Overall, the observed results demonstrate the feasibility of a multifunctional implant coating that is simultaneously able to locally deliver clinically relevant doses of antibiotics and an HA coating capable of promoting osteoconduction. This is a potentially promising step toward orthopaedic devices that combine good fixation with the ability to treat and prevent post-surgical infections...|$|R
