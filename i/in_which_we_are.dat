5|$|Applying the {{categorical}} imperative, duties arise because {{failure to}} fulfil them would either {{result in a}} contradiction in conception or in a contradiction in the will. The former are classified as perfect duties, the latter as imperfect. A perfect duty always holds true—there is a perfect duty to tell the truth, so we must never lie. An imperfect duty allows flexibility—beneficence is an imperfect duty {{because we are not}} obliged to be completely beneficent at all times, but may choose the times and places <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>are.</b> Kant believed that perfect duties are more important than imperfect duties: if a conflict between duties arises, the perfect duty must be followed.|$|E

25|$|Hypermediated: This form of {{remediation}} {{attempts to}} “refashion the older medium or media entirely, while still marking {{the presence of}} the older media and therefore maintaining a sense of multiplicity or hypermediacy” (p.46). This {{can be seen in the}} use of simultaneous window frames, which are able to run different programs representative of different media. Hypermediated remediation is akin to “a mosaic <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> simultaneously aware of the individual pieces and their new, in-appropriate setting” (p.47).|$|E
25|$|Vice Premier Wang Qishan said in {{his speech}} that History and reality both have shown and future will {{ultimately}} prove that no difficulty can ever stop the trend of cooperation between China and the US, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> full of confidence. Such confidence comes from the wide common interest between the two countries, from the common aspiration of the Chinese and the US people and from historic and philosophic thoughts. The two sides should take the opportunity of this round of SED to carefully implement the important consensus reached between the two heads of state, comprehensively deepen cooperation {{in the fields of}} trade and economy, investment, finance and infrastructure and boost the strong, sustained and balanced growth of their own economy and the world economy at large.|$|E

500|$|Liptak said it portrays {{people as}} victims of technology, while Joyner commented it denotes that [...] "the way <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> spoon-fed an almost {{constant}} stream of information through technology has turned us into passive consumers". Joyner believes that Brooker implicates the viewer with the story's credits scene, noting [...] "we're {{the ones with the}} smartphones, passively absorbing abuses to human rights and decency, and yet revelling in the image from the safety of the screen". Jeffery and Parker affirmed it contains the idea that people are preferring to document life rather than living it, as exemplified by [...] "people who see violence break out ... and decide to film it rather than intervene." [...] Leigh Alexander of Boing Boing said the episode reflects how violence is easily accessed on the Internet and quickly arouses people's attention. She noted, [...] "you can view the episode as a critique of all kinds of themes: Mob mentality, reality television, even the complicated treatment of women in the justice system ... Primarily, though, this episode is a critique of our deep, often-unexamined mass desensitization, or at least a dread portent of its potential to grow. It aims to ask: To what extent can you stand by and watch horror before you are complicit, punishable?" ...|$|E

500|$|During the 1970s, {{some critics}} pointed {{out how the}} lines of the poems were memorable and popular while others {{emphasised}} the poem's place in the greater tradition of English poetry. W. K. Wimsatt, in 1970, suggested, [...] "Perhaps we shall be tempted to say only that Gray transcends and outdoes Hammond and Shenstone simply because he writes a more poetic line, richer, fuller, more resonant and memorable in all the ways <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> accustomed to analyze the poetic quality." [...] In 1971, Charles Cudworth declared that the elegy was [...] "a work which probably contains more famous quotations per linear inch of text than any other in the English language, not even excepting Hamlet." [...] When describing how Gray's Elegy is not a conventional elegy, Eric Smith added in 1977, [...] "Yet, if the poem at so many points fails to follow the conventions, why are we considering it here? the answer is partly that no study of major English elegies could well omit it. But it is also, and more importantly, that in its essentials Gray's Elegy touches this tradition at many points, and consideration of them is of interest to both to appreciation of the poem and to seeing how [...] they become in the later tradition essential points of reference." [...] Also in 1977, Thomas Carper noted, [...] "While Gray was a schoolboy at Eton, his poetry began to show a concern with parental relationships, and with his position among the great and lowly in the world [...] But in the Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard these longstanding and very human concerns have their most affecting expression." [...] In 1978, Howard Weinbrot noted, [...] "With all its long tradition of professional examination the poem remains distant for many readers, as if the criticism could not explain why Johnson thought that [...] "The Church-yard abounds with images that find a mirrour in every mind". He continued by arguing that it is the poem's discussion of morality and death that is the source of its [...] "enduring popularity".|$|E

2500|$|After Smith officiated in Brigham Young's {{endowment}} in 1842 Smith told him, [...] "Brother Brigham, {{this is not}} arranged perfectly; however we {{have done}} {{the best we could}} under the circumstances <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> placed.

Young did as Smith directed, and under Young's direction the Nauvoo endowment ceremony was introduced to the church at large in the Nauvoo Temple during the winter of 184546. A spacious hall in the temple's attic was arranged into appropriate ordinance [...] "rooms" [...] using canvas partitions. Potted plants were used in areas representing the Garden of Eden, and other areas were furnished appropriately, including a room representing the celestial kingdom.
