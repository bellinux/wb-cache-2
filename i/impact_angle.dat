5|$|Another bout advertised for {{the event}} was Angle versus Abyss in a Falls Count Anywhere match. At Bound for Glory IV, Angle lost to TNA founder and {{on-screen}} co-owner Jeff Jarrett with Foley as Special Guest Enforcer. On the Impact! after Bound for Glory IV, Angle challenged Jarrett to another match at Turning Point, however, Jarrett refused. Angered by Jarrett's refusal, Angle began assaulting several wrestlers in TNA to persuade Jarrett into accepting the challenge. On the October 23 episode of <b>Impact!,</b> <b>Angle</b> challenged Jarrett again to a rematch, which Jarrett again refused. Jarrett, however, recommended Abyss as Angle's opponent, who was a casualty of Angle's attacks the previous week. On the October 30 episode of <b>Impact!,</b> <b>Angle</b> fought Abyss in a contest which ended in a disqualification after Angle struck Abyss with a steel chair. Following their encounter, a match was promoted pitting Angle against Abyss in a Falls Count Anywhere match at Turning Point.|$|E
5|$|Another {{encounter}} {{connected to}} the narrative that was advertised for Turning Point was Kurt Angle versus Abyss in a Falls Count Anywhere match. After Angle lost to Jeff Jarrett at Bound for Glory IV, Angle challenged Jarrett to a rematch, which was refused on the October16 episode of Impact!. To get Jarrett to accept his challenge, Angle assaulted several wrestlers in TNA. On the October23 episode of <b>Impact!,</b> <b>Angle</b> challenged Jarrett to a rematch for the second time. Jarrett refused the offer for a second time, but recommended a casualty of Angle's attacks, Abyss, as Angle's opponent.

5|$|The main storyline {{heading into}} Final Resolution {{revolved}} around the group The Angle Alliance. On November 11, 2007 at TNA's Genesis PPV event partners in Christian's Coalition, A.J. Styles and Tomko, aided Kurt Angle in retaining the TNA World Heavyweight Championship in the main event without Coalition leader Christian Cage's consent. Afterwards on the November 15, 2007 episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact!, Styles and Tomko joined Angle in creating The Angle Alliance, while remaining tied to Cage. Styles followed by trying to join the two fractions together {{leading up to the}} December 6, 2007 episode of Impact!, where Cage became leader of a joint alliance, until Angle and Robert Roode attacked Cage later in the episode. On the December 20, 2007 episode of <b>Impact!,</b> <b>Angle</b> versus Cage for the title was promoted for Final Resolution.|$|E
40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} and theoretical calculations often use vertical <b>impact</b> <b>angles</b> (90 deg) {{in order to}} avoid the complicating effect of asymmetry. Nevertheless, oblique impacts represent the most likely starting condition for planetary cratering. Changing both <b>impact</b> <b>angles</b> and atmospheric pressure not only allows testing previous results for vertical impacts but also reveals phenomena whose signatures would otherwise be masked in the planetary cratering record. The laboratory studies were performed for investigating impact cratering processes. <b>Impact</b> <b>angles</b> can be increased from 0 to 90 deg in 15 deg increments while maintaining a flat target surface. Different atmospheres (nitrogen, argon, and helium) characterized the effects of both gas density and Mach number. Targets varied according to purpose. Because of the complexities in atmosphere-impactor-ejecta interactions, no single combination allows direct simulation of a planetary-scale (10 - 100 km) event. Nevertheless, fundamental processes and observed phenomena allow formulating first-order models at such broad scales...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In gymnastics, {{the wrist}} {{is exposed to}} many {{different}} stresses including increased extension, especially during back handsprings. Currently a wrist extension <b>angle</b> during <b>impact</b> that places the wrist in danger has not been established. The {{purpose of this study}} was to: (1) determine the mean <b>impact</b> wrist <b>angle</b> during a standing back handspring in female preadolescent and adolescent gymnasts and (2) determine which factors predict <b>impact</b> wrist <b>angles.</b> METHODS: Fifty female gymnasts from six facilities, ages 8 - 15 were included in this study. Each gymnast completed a questionnaire about gymnastics participation and history of wrist pain. Active range of motion of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, and ankle was measured. Each gymnast was asked to perform a standard back handspring, which was videotaped. The wrist and shoulder flexion <b>angles,</b> at maximum <b>impact,</b> were recorded and measured using motion analysis software. Two-sample t-test was used to assess the relationship between <b>impact</b> wrist <b>angle</b> and wrist pain. Multiple linear regression was used to determine the association between related variables and <b>impact</b> wrist <b>angle.</b> RESULTS: The mean back handspring <b>impact</b> wrist <b>angle</b> was 95 °. Fifteen subjects (30 %) reported wrist pain. Years of participation (p= 0. 02) and <b>impact</b> shoulder <b>angle</b> (p= 0. 04) were predictive of <b>impact</b> wrist <b>angles.</b> CONCLUSION: Shoulder angles and years of participation correlate with <b>impact</b> wrist <b>angles</b> during the performance of a standing back handspring. Future studies are necessary to determine if addressing these factors can affect the <b>impact</b> wrist <b>angles.</b> LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3...|$|R

5|$|Angle {{went on to}} {{have two}} {{successful}} defenses as champion. His first defense came in TNA in a feud against Samoa Joe. Angle first appeared with the title belt in TNA on the July 5, 2007, episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact!. The title belt became relevant to the storyline rivalry between Joe and Angle heading into TNA's Hard Justice pay-per-view (PPV) event. Leading up to TNA's Victory Road PPV event on July 15, 2007, TNA X Division Champion Joe and TNA World Heavyweight Champion Angle teamed together to face TNA World Tag Team Champions Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray) in a Tag Team match with the stipulation being whoever scored the pinfall or submission for their team won the championship of the person pinned or made to submit. Joe pinned Brother Ray in the bout, thus winning the World Tag Team Championship for himself and a partner of his choosing. Joe chose to hold the title alone and challenged Angle to a Winner Take All match at Hard Justice for the TNA World Heavyweight, TNA X Division, TNA World Tag Team, and the IWGP Heavyweight Championships on the July 19 2007, episode of <b>Impact!.</b> <b>Angle</b> accepted the match, with Joe and Angle facing at Hard Justice on August 12, 2007 in Orlando, Florida {{for all of the}} titles. Angle defeated Joe at the event to win the TNA World Tag Team and TNA X Division Championships, while retaining the TNA World Heavyweight and IWGP Heavyweight Championships. Afterwards, TNA slowly fazed out the IWGP Heavyweight Championship with Angle going on to defend the title at IGF and NJPW promoted shows, with the title being referred to as both the IWGP Heavyweight Championship and the IWGP 3rd Belt Championship.|$|E
5|$|At TNA's {{previous}} No Surrender PPV {{event on}} September14, Sting announced that TNA management {{had decided that}} he would challenge the TNA World Heavyweight Champion for the title at Bound for Glory. Later in the show, Joe defeated Christian Cage and Angle in a Three Ways to Glory match to retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship after Jarrett interfered in the bout by bashing a guitar over Angle's head. Following No Surrender on the September18 episode of Impact!, Sting discussed his actions further, stating that when he was younger he learned from the veterans in the industry and that Joe and Styles had been disrespectful in their rivalries with Booker T and Angle. Jarrett responded to Sting's comments later in the show, stating that the issue was not about disrespect, it was about the veterans in the company not wanting to retire and let the younger wrestlers be stars. Angle argued that he made TNA a success, not the efforts of Jarrett, Sting, Joe, or Styles. Angle then challenged Jarrett to a match at Bound for Glory IV, which Jarrett declined. On the September25 episode of <b>Impact!,</b> <b>Angle</b> challenged Jarrett to a match again, this time threatening and mocking him along with his daughters. Jarrett accepted Angle's challenge afterwards. Sting also expressed his reasons for having a desire to face Joe for the title on the same telecast, stating that he was taught respect by veterans in his youth so he was going to defeat Joe for the championship at Bound for Glory to teach Joe respect. Mick Foley was announced as the Special Ringside Enforcer for the Jarrett versus Angle bout on the October2 Impact! episode. Sting and Joe signed the contract for their encounter on the October9 episode of Impact!, with the stipulation added {{that there would be no}} rematch between the two after the event regardless of the outcome.|$|E
25|$|On the {{following}} episode of <b>Impact!,</b> <b>Angle</b> announced the disbanding of the Main Event Mafia, which Steiner refused to accept.

25|$|At Bound for Glory IV, Styles faced Christian Cage and Booker T in a {{three-way}} match in which Booker T won. Shortly after that, Booker T, Kurt Angle, Kevin Nash and Sting formed The Main Event Mafia, and Styles {{teamed up with}} Samoa Joe to fight them. On the October 30 episode of Impact!, Styles and Joe formed a faction of younger wrestlers known as The TNA Front Line to combat The Main Event Mafia, who recruited Scott Steiner. Styles challenged Sting for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at Turning Point and again in an eight-man tag team match at Final Resolution, but was unsuccessful each time. On the January 22, 2009 episode of <b>Impact!,</b> <b>Angle</b> vowed to end Styles' career and later that night beat Styles in a tables match, where Styles was injured (kayfabe).|$|E
25|$|The cruise stage {{carried the}} MSL {{spacecraft}} through the void {{of space and}} delivered it to Mars. The interplanetary trip covered the distance of 352 million miles in 253 days. The cruise stage has its own miniature propulsion system, consisting of eight thrusters using hydrazine fuel in two titanium tanks. It also has its own electric power system, consisting of a solar array and battery for providing continuous power. Upon reaching Mars, the spacecraft stopped spinning and a cable cutter separated the cruise stage from the aeroshell. Then the cruise stage was diverted into a separate trajectory into the atmosphere. In December 2012, the debris field from the cruise stage was located by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.

25|$|Upon {{impacting}} the ground, some translational {{kinetic energy}} {{can be converted}} to rotational kinetic energy and vice-versa depending on the ball's <b>impact</b> <b>angle</b> and angular velocity. If the ball moves horizontally at impact, friction will have a 'translational' component in the direction opposite to the ball's motion. In the figure, the ball is moving to the right, and thus it will have a translational component of friction pushing the ball to the left. Additionally, if the ball is spinning at impact, friction will have a 'rotational' component in the direction opposite to the ball's rotation. On the figure, the ball is spinning clockwise, and the point impacting the ground is moving to the left with respect to the ball's center of mass. The rotational component of friction is therefore pushing the ball to the right. Unlike the normal force and the force of gravity, these frictional forces will exert a torque on the ball, and change its angular velocity (omega&).|$|E
25|$|At Turning Point, Jarrett {{defeated}} Joe after choking him {{out with}} a baton, following interference from Gunner and Murphy, his security officers. On the following episode of Impact!, Jarrett assaulted Joe after he had defeated Gunner and Murphy in a handicap match, but was then chased away by the returning Kurt Angle. At Final Resolution, Jarrett faced Joe in a submission match; after a pre–match assault and later an interference by Gunner and Murphy, Jarrett managed to force Joe to submit with an ankle lock. On the January 6, 2011 episode of <b>Impact!,</b> <b>Angle</b> interrupted Jarrett's $100,000 mixed martial arts (MMA) challenge and signed a contract to face him at Genesis in an MMA exhibition match, since he had promised not to wrestle again.

At Destination X, Angle defeated Anderson by submission in a rematch. Anderson and Angle were booked in a rubber match inside a steel cage at Lockdown. On the April 5 edition of Impact!, Anderson defeated Angle in a ladder match to win possession of the key to the cage door. At Lockdown, Angle defeated Anderson in a steel cage match. At Sacrifice, Anderson was defeated by Jeff Hardy. After the match, Anderson offered to shake Hardy's hand, but the offer was declined.

500|$|Angle {{returned}} on the October 10 {{episode of}} Impact attacking EGO and challenged Bobby Roode to a match at Bound For Glory. The following week, Angle stated his discontentment with Roode mocking his Hall of Fame induction and told Roode {{he would make}} him [...] tap out. Roode responded by attacking Angle with help from his faction, EGO, forcing Angle {{to submit to the}} crossface hold in a precursory act prior to their match. At the PPV Angle was inducted into the TNA Hall of Fame but he refused to accept the offer as he felt he had let himself, TNA and the fans down and didn't deserve a Hall of Fame induction ceremony. He also said he would accept the offer when he feels he has earned it and he still has great things to do in TNA. Later in that night, Angle was defeated by Roode, after he landed awkwardly from a running belly-to-belly suplex. [...] On the October 31 episode of <b>Impact,</b> <b>Angle</b> lied about gaining medical clearance as Angle suffered (kayfabe) convulsions during the match against Bobby Roode after a bad landing from the same move again, which resulted in referee Brian Hebner rewarding a knock out/count-out victory to Roode. After the match, he also showed signs of post-concussive amnesia. On November 5, Angle was reported to had tested negative for the concussion, but his recurring knee injuries still required monitoring. The following week, Angle saw the New Main Event Mafia being disbanded, then he was attacked by Roode after he accused him to use his injuries {{to get out of the}} match. On November 14, Angle won a submission match against Austin Aries in the World title tournament, but by using Roode's finisher: the arm trap crossface, with Roode watching on at the ramp.

Cage was set to defend the NWA Championship against Sting at Sacrifice, however, on the May 3, 2007 episode of <b>Impact!</b> <b>Angle</b> was added to the match, making it a three way match. The day of the PPV, the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), the owners of the NWA World Heavyweight and the NWA World Tag Team Championships, stripped Cage of the title and Team 3D of the tag team titles. NWA Executive Director Robert K. Trobich stated the reason was that Cage refused to defend the NWA Title at NWA live events. At the PPV event, Cage, still holding the physical NWA Championship belt, defended what was billed as the [...] "World Heavyweight Championship" [...] against Angle and Sting. Angle was the victor of said contest by making Sting submit, who had [...] "technically" [...] just pinned Cage at the very same moment, and was announced as the new [...] "World Heavyweight Champion". The Impact! following the event, Angle came to the ring with a new championship belt in-toe, and announced he was the new [...] "TNA World Heavyweight Champion", a championship that TNA had just introduced at Sacrifice. Afterwards, Cage and Sting came to the ring and the three began to argue over who was the new TNA World Heavyweight Champion. Due to the controversial finish to their match at Sacrifice, the title was declared vacant by Cornette. A tournament was held for the title which culminated in a King of the Mountain match at TNA's Slammiversary PPV event on June 17, 2007. Cage won entry into the match on the June 14, 2007 episode of Impact!, by defeating Abyss.
