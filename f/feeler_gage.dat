50|$|DTIs are a {{function}} of induced tension. As a fastener assembly is tightened, the arch-like protrusions are compressed and the change in distance between {{the base of the}} protrusions of the DTI washer and the protrusion apex, correlates to a value of tensile force induced into the fastener. This distance can be verified by insertion of a tapered <b>feeler</b> <b>gage</b> between the protrusions to the bolt shank. The number of instances the bolt shank can be reached by the <b>feeler</b> <b>gage</b> is then compared to either the results of a pre-installation verification procedure or the manufacturer's instructions.|$|E

40|$|In late 1959 a {{spectrophotometer}} laboratory {{was established}} at JPL {{to be used}} as a support for temperature-control programs. The immediate task was spectroradiometric measurements of light sources to be used in a simulated-deep-space environment chamber. It was also necessary to have permanent provisions for measuring reflectances of surfaces for the calculation of solar absorptance alpha, and thermal emittance epsilon. The spectral distribution of an unknown source, in this case a Ventarc carbon-arc lamp, was derived from the ratio of detector outputs (with monochromatic light) of the arc lamp and a tungsten lamp, and the spectral intensity of the tungsten lamp. The tungsten lamp is a ribbonfilament lamp calibrated from 0. 25 to 2. 6 microns. A recording of pen deflection (linearly proportional to detector output) of each source over the visible and near infrared range is made with all parameters (slit width, amplifier gain, and source focusing) identical; then the ratios are computed at discrete wavelengths from these recordings. Because the spectral intensities of the tungsten lamp and a solar simulator are very different in most of the range, an adjustable slit is placed immediately in front of the detector to obtain comparable pen deflections for the two sources. This slit is set by means of a <b>feeler</b> <b>gage,</b> and the attenuation coefficient is evaluated by a transmission measurement...|$|E
