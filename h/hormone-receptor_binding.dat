40|$|A {{mechanism}} of signal transduction by human choriogonadotropin (hCG) has been proposed. Competitive inhibition of the binding of hCG to its receptor by the serine protease inhibitors {{led to the}} identification of local structural homology of an extracellular region of the receptor with the reactive site loop of chymotrypsin inhibitor. Synthetic peptides from the extracellular domain of luteinizing hormone-choriogonadotropin (LH/CG) receptor, rationally designed {{on the basis of}} this homology, were found to affect <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>binding</b> and bioactivity. A receptor peptide incorporating one complete structural unit of the leucine-rich repeats motif of the extracellular domain of the receptor significantly increased hCG-receptor binding in a dose-dependent manner. However, the testosterone production in a Leydig cell bioassay was inhibited in the presence of this peptide. The agonistic effect on the hCG-receptor binding and the antagonistic effect on the testosterone production of a receptor peptide suggests the possibility of more than one quasi-equivalent receptor-binding site on the hormone. Hormone-induced receptor oligomerization may therefore be involved in the {{mechanism of}} signal transduction by hCG...|$|E
40|$|In mouse Ltk- {{cells that}} were {{transfected}} with recombinant bacteriophage DNA containing a complete proviral copy {{of an integrated}} endogenous mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) with its flanking cellular sequences, the newly acquired MMTV proviruses were transcribed in a glucocorticoid-responsive fashion. After hormone treatment of selected cell clones in culture we isolated the nuclei, elongated the nascent RNA chains in vitro, and determined the number of RNA polymerase II molecules on the transcribed MMTV DNA {{as well as on}} the flanking mouse DNA sequences. We found that the specific increase in the polymerase loading after hormone treatment is proportional to the increase in the amount of stable MMTV mRNA. When the DNA sequences which are responsible for <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>binding</b> and for the increased MMTV mRNA levels were deleted, no increase in RNA polymerase II loading on MMTV DNA was observed. Nuclear RNA chains which were transcribed in response to hormone treatment were detected not only from the transfected MMTV DNA but also from the mouse DNA sequences adjacent to the 3 ' end of the provirus...|$|E
40|$|Regulation {{of human}} {{thyrotropin}} beta subunit gene (TSHB) expression by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) was examined in a clonal rat pituitary-cell line (GH 3). Transient expression studies {{were done with}} various 5 '-flanking DNA sequences of TSHB coupled to reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. Deletion analysis defined two discrete regions (- 128 to - 92 base pairs and - 28 to + 8 base pairs) that each mediated an approximately 2 -fold TRH induction. The upstream site contains a DNA sequence with close homology to the DNA-binding site for a pituitary-specific transcriptional factor Pit- 1 /GHF- 1. DNase I footprinting analysis of mouse thyrotropic tumor extract as well as DNA-transfection studies using an expression vector containing an N-terminal deletion of Pit- 1 /GHF- 1 cDNA suggest that Pit- 1 /GHF- 1 or a closely related protein in the thyrotroph mediates TRH responsiveness of this gene. In addition, the downstream site overlaps with the recently characterized thyroid hormone-inhibitory element of TSHB. In fact, deletion of DNA sequences important in thyroid <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>binding</b> (c-erbAB/c-ERBA 2) from + 3 to + 8 base pairs, significantly reduced (30 %) TRH responsiveness. The location of a TRH-stimulatory element near a thyroid hormone-inhibitory element may allow for fine control of TSHB expression in vivo...|$|E
40|$|It is well {{established}} that cortisol excess causes insulin resistance in man, but the mechanisms responsible for this insulin resistance are poorly understood. We studied five women with Cushing's syndrome with impaired oral glucose tolerance tests and seven normal subjects, plotting {{the shape of the}} insulin-induced disposal dose-response curve obtained by means of the euglycemic clamp procedure during four different plasma insulin plateaus at four infusion rates of 21, 73, 760, and 1200 mU/M 2. min. Glucose disposal (M = mg/M 2. min) was calculated as glucose amount infused to maintain euglycemia. In Cushing's syndrome the dose-response curve was shifted to the right in comparison with normal subjects, with a significantly lower M (337 +/- 35 vs. 657 +/- 76 P less than 0. 01) during the highest insulin infusion rate [maximal glucose disposal (MGD) ] without any significant difference in the levels of insulin half-maximally effective in the stimulation of glucose utilization. Neither erythrocyte nor monocyte maximum insulin receptor binding were different between the two populations. Four Cushing's syndrome patients were studied again after surgical treatment. A marked improvement of MGD was observed without any significant change in insulin-binding capacity. These results, particularly the marked decrease in MGD, a typical feature of postreceptor defects, indicate that cortisol-induced insulin resistance in man is due to an impairment of peripheral insulin action located beyond the <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>binding</b> step...|$|E
40|$|AbstractProtein-Protein-Interactions (PPIs) {{play the}} most {{important}} roles in most (if not all) of the biological processes. A few such examples include <b>hormone–receptor</b> <b>binding,</b> signal transduction, chaperone activity, antigen-antibody interactions. The disruptions of PPIs may therefore {{lead to the development}} of human inherited diseases. There are different analytical techniques to identify amino acid residues in protein interfaces. But they are time consuming, labour intensive and above all very expensive. As an alternative approach to the analytical methods, we have tried to develop machine learning tools to differentiate between protein interface and non-interface amino acid residues. We used sequence- and structure-based features derived from a set of protein hetero-complex structure files from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). We have built supervised predictors based on Random Forests (RF) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). We have evaluated them with 10 -fold cross-validations. Both of our sequence and structure based RF predictors performed better than SVM based ones. The most predictive sequence- and structure- based features are the attributes which measure sequence conservation at a specified amino acid residue and various other measurements of the amino acid residue's neighbouring charge distributions. Our sequence- and structure-based RF classifiers have been validated by evaluating them against the protein complexes with experimentally proven interaction sites. Our predictors are found to detect the protein interface residues in practice. Availability: [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Young female mice fed a choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented (CDE) diet rapidly develop acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis. We have {{observed}} that pancreatic acini prepared from these mice are unable to secrete amylase in response to addition of the cholinergic agonist carbachol, although they retain the ability to secrete amylase {{in response to the}} Ca 2 + ionophore A 23187. The CDE diet does not alter the binding characteristics (Kd or the maximal number of binding sites) for muscarinic cholinergic receptors as tested using the antagonist [3 H]N-methylscopolamine nor the competition for this binding by carbachol. Addition of carbachol to acini prepared from mice fed the CDE diet does not result in as marked an increase in cytosolic free Ca 2 + levels as that noted in control samples (evaluated using quin 2 fluorescence). These observations indicate that the CDE diet interferes with stimulus-secretion coupling in mouse pancreatic acini at a step subsequent to <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>binding</b> and prior to Ca 2 + release. This conclusion is confirmed by our finding that the hormone-stimulated generation of [3 H]inositol phosphates (inositol trisphosphate, inositol bisphosphate, and inositol monophosphate) from acini labeled with [3 H]myoinositol is markedly reduced in acini prepared from mice fed the CDE diet. This reduction is not due to a decrease in phosphatidylinositol- 4, 5 -bisphosphate. This communication represents the first report of a system in which a blockade of inositol phosphate generation can be related to a physiologic defect and pathologic lesion...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Insect neuropeptides play a {{vital role}} in the hormone release {{processes}} associated with insect flight Elucidation of the metabolic flight pathways requires a knowledge of the peptide secondary structure to allow predictions to be made regarding <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>binding</b> processes. The three insect neuropeptides under investigation were taken from the corpora cardiaca of the migratory locust (Locusta migratoria) and belonged to the Lom peptide series - Lom-AKH-I, II and Ill. The secondary structure of these hormones was investigated using high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques and various molecular mechanics computations. The interproton distances and φ torsion angles obtained from the NMR data were used to constrain the peptides in subsequent Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics (simulated annealing) calculations. The results of these calculations indicated that Lom-AKH-I and Lom-AKH-III adopt a definite structure in d⁶-DMSO solution, while Lom-AKH-II appeared to be fluctional with a minimum of three structures being required to satisfy the experimental data. Lom-AKH-I and ill were shown to adopt a loose open turn structures stabilised by the presence of a single hydrogen bond. Both had an additional concave structure with hydrophobic clustering on the convex surface of the molecule. The results suggest that Lom-AKH-I and Lom-AKH-III are more reactive than Lom-AKH-II. These predictions are in agreement with literature results obtained for Lom-AKH-I and II for lipid mobilisation and phosphorylase activation. However, when measured against cAMP production, Lom-AKH-II has higher activity. Insufficient literature was available to make structure/activity comparisons for Lom-AKH-III...|$|E
40|$|Myoglobin (MB) is {{not only}} {{strongly}} expressed in myocytes, but also at much lower levels in different cancer entities. 40 % of breast tumors are MB-positive, with the globin being co-expressed with markers of tumor hypoxia in a proportion of cases. In breast cancer, MB expression {{is associated with a}} positive hormone receptor status and patient prognosis. In prostate cancer, another hormone-dependent cancer type, 53 % of tumors were recently shown to express MB. Especially in more aggressive prostate cancer specimen MB expression also correlates with increased patient survival rates. Both findings might be due to tumor-suppressing properties of MB in cancer cells. In contrast to muscle, MB transcription in breast and prostate cancer mainly depends on a novel, alternative promoter site. We show here that its associated transcripts can be upregulated by hypoxia and downregulated by estrogens and androgens in MCF 7 breast and LNCaP prostate cancer cells, respectively. Bioinformatic data mining of epigenetic histone marks and experimental verification reveal a hitherto uncharacterized transcriptional network that drives the regulation of the MB gene in cancer cells. We identified candidate <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>binding</b> elements that may interact with the cancer-associated MB promoter to decrease its activity in breast and prostate cancer cells. Additionally, a regulatory element, 250 kb downstream of the promoter, acts as a hypoxia-inducible site within the transcriptional machinery. Understanding the distinct regulation of MB in tumors will improve unraveling the respiratory protein's function in the cancer context and may provide new starting points for developing therapeutic strategies...|$|E
40|$|Corticotropin (ACTH) -releasing factor, {{vasoactive}} intestinal peptide, and catecholamines [...] {{hormones that}} stimulate ACTH secretion and cAMP generation [...] increased cytosolic calcium in AtT- 20 cells. The increase in intracellular calcium is presumably {{a consequence of}} the stimulated cAMP synthesis, since forskolin, an activator of the catalytic unit of adenylate cyclase, and the cAMP analog 8 -bromoadenosine 3 ', 5 '-cyclic monophosphate (8 Br-cAMP) also increased the cytosolic levels of this ion. Pretreatment with somatostatin, a neuropeptide that inhibits stimulation of the adenylate cyclase system and the secretion of ACTH blocked the increase of cytosolic calcium. The effect of 8 Br-cAMP, which bypasses the cyclase, was not inhibited by somatostatin pretreatment. The source of the increased calcium appears to be mainly extracellular. This is indicated by the inability of the secretagogues to increase cytosolic calcium in a medium deprived of this ion or in the presence of blockers of voltage-gated calcium channels. The involvement of calcium channels in the calcium rise evoked by the secretagogues was supported by experiments using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. In these experiments 8 Br-cAMP increased voltage-dependent calcium currents. These results suggest the following chain of events in the receptor-mediated elevation of cytosolic calcium and the concomitant release of ACTH from AtT- 20 cells: <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>binding</b> [...] cAMP synthesis [...] protein kinase activation [...] calcium channel activation [...] increase in cytosolic calcium [...] many steps [...] ACTH release.

40|$|Vasopressin, {{angiotensin}} and phenylephrine stimulate glycogenolysis in postnatal rat liver by a Ca 2 +-mediated mechanism not involving cyclic AMP. To {{determine whether}} these hormones promote glycogenolysis in foetal liver, we have examined their effects, {{and those of}} the Ca 2 + ionophore A 23187, on glycogen metabolism in cultured foetal-rat hepatocytes. Vasopressin and angiotensin (0. 1 nM- 0. 1 microM) had no effects on either glycogen synthesis (as assessed by [14 C]glucose incorporation into glycogen) or phosphorylase a activity. However, A 23187 at 1 and 10 microM inhibited glycogen synthesis by 31. 3 and 89. 1 % respectively (both P less than 0. 001) and stimulated phosphorylase a activity by 66. 9 and 184. 1 % respectively (both P less than 0. 01). Incubation of cells in Ca 2 +-deficient medium attenuated the effects of 10 microM-A 23187 on glycogen synthesis and abolished the effects of 1 microM-A 23187. As in postnatal liver, glucagon (1 and 20 nM) and isoprenaline (1 and 10 microM), which activate adenylate cyclase, inhibited glycogen synthesis and stimulated phosphorylase a activity in foetal hepatocytes. The minimal effective concentration of phenylephrine was 10 times that of isoprenaline. These results indicate striking differences in the ontogeny of cyclic AMP-mediated and Ca 2 +-mediated processes which regulate hepatic glycogenolysis. Since increases in cytosolic Ca 2 + induce glycogenolysis in foetal-rat liver, the weak or absent responses to vasopressin, angiotensin and the alpha-adrenergic agonists may result from defects in <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>binding</b> or in post-receptor events leading to the mobilization of intracellular Ca 2 + stores...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE — Glucagon-like peptide (GLP) - 1 {{receptor}} is encoded by GLP 1 R. The {{effect of}} genetic variation at this locus on {{the response to}} GLP- 1 is unknown. This study assessed the effect ofGLP 1 R polymorphisms on insulin secretion in response to hyperglycemia and to infused GLP- 1 in nondiabetic subjects. RESEARCHDESIGNANDMETHODS — Eighty-eight healthy individuals (aged 26. 3 0. 6 years, fasting glucose 4. 830. 04 mmol/l) were studied using a hyperglycemic clamp. GLP- 1 was infused for the last 2 h of the study (0. 75 pmol/kg/min over 121 – 180 min, 1. 5 pmol/kg/min over 181 – 240 min). -Cell responsivity (Total) was measured using a C-peptide minimal model. The effect of 21 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in GLP 1 R onTotal was examined. RESULTS — Two SNPs (rs 6923761 and rs 3765467) were nominally associated with altered -cell responsivity in response to GLP- 1 infusion. CONCLUSIONS — Variation inGLP 1 Rmay alter insulin secretion in response to exogenous GLP- 1. Future studies will determine whether such variation accounts for interindividual dif-ferences in response to GLP- 1 –based therapy. Diabetes Care 33 : 2074 – 2076, 2010 E xpression of a nonsynonymous sin-gle nucleotide polymorphism (SNP),which results in substitution of me-thionine for threonine at position 149 of GLP 1 R in cell systems, decreases binding affinity for glucagon-like peptide (GLP) - 1 and intracellular signaling after <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>binding</b> (1). These functional ef-fects suggest that genetic variation in GLP 1 R may alter responsiveness to GLP- 1 in vivo. To examine this hypothesis, we used a hyperglycemic clamp, together with GLP- 1 –amide (7, 36) infusion, and measured insulin secretion using a mod-ification of the C-peptide minimal model to determine -cell responsivity (Total) to GLP- 1 in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Transcription of mouse mammary {{tumor virus}} DNA is stimulated by steroid hormones. The DNA {{sequences}} {{involved in this}} regulation {{are located in the}} viral long terminal repeat between positions - 200 and - 50 with respect to the transcription initiation site. In this region four, one distal and three proximal, in vitro binding sites for the glucocorticoid hormone-receptor complexes have been identified. We have prepared a series of 5 ' and 3 ' deletions of this region, using the exonuclease ExoIII. Combination of suitable 5 ' and 3 ' fragments enabled us to reconstitute the entire long terminal repeat with small internal deletions. The mutated long terminal repeats linked to the coding region of the Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene were introduced into LTK- aprt- cells by transfection. Transcription from the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter in {{the presence or absence of}} hormone was assayed by nuclease S 1 mapping. Deletion of the proximal in vitro binding sites resulted in a decrease in hormonal inducibility. When a synthetic oligonucleotide harboring the sequence of the distal in vitro binding site was inserted at the site of the proximal ones, hormone response was restored. This indicated that the distal binding site can replace the proximal ones in their hormone-regulatory function. However, insertion at the same site of an oligonucleotide containing the sequence 5 ' TGTTCT 3 ' found in all four binding sites, did not restore the hormone response, indicating that sequences flanking the TGTTCT motif are required for hormone response. Insertion of an unrelated DNA fragment at the site of the proximal binding element deletion completely abolished the hormone response. Analyses of different proximal binding-site deletion and insertion mutants suggested the presence of a transcriptional element located downstream from the most proximal <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>binding</b> site...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the role of cyclic AMP in the phosphaturic response to parathyroid hormone in vitamin D-deficient rats. Infusion of purified bovine parathyroid hormone (13. 3 mug/h) into control, D-fed, or D-deficient, thyroparathyroidectomized rats produced a sixfold increase in renal phosphate and cyclic AMP excretion in D-fed rats, but only a two- to threefold increase in both parameters in D-deficient animals. Intravenous injection of parathyroid hormone over the dosage range from 1 - 50 mug/kg resulted in a dose-dependent increase in phosphate and cyclic AMP excretion with both D-fed and D-deficient thyroparathyroidectomized rats. However, the D-deficient rats responded to these injections of parathyroid hormone with a two- to threefold increase in both renal phosphate and cyclic AMP excretion at the highest dose of 50 mug/kg, whereas the D-fed animals' response was 35 -fold and 11 -fold over control excretion levels of phosphate and cyclic AMP, respectively. To directly examine {{the role of the}} renal cortical adenylate cyclase system in the blunted phosphaturic and urinary cyclic AMP responses to parathyroid hormone in D-deficient rats, we prepared a plasma membrane fraction enriched in this enzyme activity from the renal cortex of D-fed and D-deficient thyroparathyroidectomized rats. The renal cortical adenylate cyclase of D-deficient rats showed significantly (P less than 0. 001) less activation by parathyroid hormone over the hormone concentration range from 0. 3 to 7. 0 mug/ml than was observed with the enzyme prepared from D-fed animals. Basal adenylate cyclase activity and the fluoride-stimulated enzyme activity were not altered by the state of D-deficiency. These experiments demonstrate that the blunted phosphaturic response to parathyroid hormone observed in D-deficient rats is associated with the reduced responsiveness of the renal cortical adenylate cyclase to the hormone. Moreover, the defect in the renal membrane adenylate cyclase system appears to be localized at the level of PTH binding to membrane receptors or, alternatively, at the level of transmission of the <b>hormone-receptor</b> <b>binding</b> signal to the catalytic moiety of this membrane enzyme...|$|E
