40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{results of a}} global {{resource}} assessment for geothermal energy within deep aquifers for <b>direct</b> <b>heat</b> utilization. Greenhouse heating, spatial heating, and spatial cooling are considered in this assessment. We derive subsurface temperatures from geophysical data and apply a volumetric heat-in-place method to improve current global geothermal resource base estimates for <b>direct</b> <b>heat</b> applications. The amount of thermal energy stored within aquifers depends on the Earth's heat flow, aquifer volume, and thermal properties. We assess the thermal energy available by estimating subsurface temperatures up {{to a depth of}} three kilometer depending on aquifer thickness. The distribution of geothermal resources is displayed in a series of maps and the depth of the minimum production temperature is used as an indicator of performance and technical feasibility. Suitable aquifers underlay 16 % of the Earth's land surface and store an estimated 4 · 10 5 to 5 · 10 6 EJ that could theoretically be used for <b>direct</b> <b>heat</b> applications. Even with a conservative recovery factor of 1 % and an assumed lifetime of 30 years, the annual recoverable geothermal energy is in the same order as the world final energy consumption of 363. 5 EJ yr − 1. Although the amount of geothermal energy stored in aquifers is vast, geothermal <b>direct</b> <b>heat</b> applications are currently underdeveloped with less than one thousandth of their technical potential used. </p...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{geothermal}} energy for <b>direct</b> <b>heat</b> purposes {{by the private}} sector within the US has been quite limited to date. However, there is a large potential market for thermal energy in such areas as industrial processing, agribusiness, and space/water heating of commercial and residential buildings. Technical and economic information is needed to assist in identifying prospective <b>direct</b> <b>heat</b> users and to match their energy needs to specific geothermal reservoirs. Technological uncertainties and associated economic risks can influence the user's perception of profitability to the point of limiting private investment in geothermal direct applications. To stimulate development in the <b>direct</b> <b>heat</b> area, the Department of Energy, Division of Geothermal Energy, issued two Program Opportunity Notices (PON's). These solicitations are part of DOE's national {{geothermal energy}} program plan, which has as its goal the near-term commercialization {{by the private sector}} of hydrothermal resources.

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 A {{thermodynamic}} {{analysis of}} forced geoheat recovery from aquifers has been accomplished. The system investigated {{consists of a}} single recharging-discharging well pair, in a horizontally extensive aquifer, with either power generation or space heating as surface applications. The space heating systems investigated are (i) <b>direct</b> <b>heating,</b> (ii) heat pumps and (iii) a combination of <b>direct</b> <b>heating</b> and heat pumps. The thermodynamic performance parameters considered are the effectiveness (Second Law Efficiency) and fossil fuel savings. Previous work on this problem has considered only the surface system with a specified temperature at the wellhead. Also, in the previous work, the surface system was either power generation only or heating only. This thesis includes the subsurface system in the analysis and the surface application of this work is treated as an important parameter. Due to {{the interaction between the}} surface and subsurface systems, the load conditions and geologic conditions play important roles in determining the optimum operation. The analysis indicates that the well separation should be large enough to insure a constant production temperature during the project life time. For high temperature resources(higher than about 435 K), power generation yields the best performance and is therefore recommended. The relative desirability of the combination (heating and heat pumps) requires consideration of the load condition, resource temperature and other geologic conditions. Such evaluations for these automatically determine the appropriate ranges of <b>direct</b> <b>heating.</b> The optimum operation of each system is also dependent on the same parameters as well as the injection temperature. Analysis also has been done on a given well system with a small well separation. In such a case, operation must be continued after thermal breakthrough in order to obtain a moderate output {{for the life of the}} system. Power generation and the combination do not have good performance with this model. <b>Direct</b> <b>heating,</b> with careful control of flow rate, appears to be the preferred system. For low temperature resources, heat pumps can only be used with careful control of the flow rate and injection temperature...|$|R
