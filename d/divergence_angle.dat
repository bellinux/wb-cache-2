50|$|Especially, the {{violation}} of energy and momentum conservation laws have been heavily criticized. In a presentation at Nasa Ames Research Centre in November, 2014, Harold White {{addressed the issue of}} conservation of momentum by stating that the Q-thruster conserves momentum by creating a wake or anisotropic state in the quantum vacuum.

White stated that this principle was similar to how a submarine uses its propeller to push water in one direction, while the submarine recoils to conserve momentum.
