GM 1 <b>gangliosidosis,</b> a lysosomal storage disease that affects the brain and multiple systemic organs, is due to an autosomal recessively inherited deficiency of acid β-galactosidase activity. Pathogenesis of GM 1 <b>gangliosidosis</b> may include neuronal apoptosis and abnormal axoplasmic transport and inflammatory response, which are perhaps consequent to massive neuronal storage of GM 1 ganglioside. In the present study, we assessed some possible CSF biomarkers, such as GM 1 ganglioside, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and myelin basic protein (MBP). Periodic studies demonstrated that GM 1 ganglioside concentration, activities of AST and LDH, and concentrations of NSE and MBP in CSF were significantly higher in dogs with GM 1 <b>gangliosidosis</b> than those in control dogs, and their changes were well related with the months of age and clinical course. In conclusion, GM 1 ganglioside, AST, LDH, NSE and MBP could be utilized as CSF biomarkers showing CNS degeneration in dogs with GM 1 <b>gangliosidosis</b> to evaluate the efficacy of novel therapies proposed for this disease. In addition, we preliminarily treated an affected dog with long-term oral administration of prednisolone and evaluated the efficacy of this therapeutic trial using CSF biomarkers determined in the present study.

40|$|Background: GM- 1 <b>gangliosidosis</b> is {{included}} in the group of lysosomal diseases and is characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme b-galactosidase, which as a consequence produces accumulation of GM 1 ganglioside in nervous cells and galactosil oligosaccharides and products of keratan sulfate degradation in other tissues. Clinically this disease presents with an early psychomotor impairment, macular cherry red spots, facial dysmorphia, bone deformities and hepatosplenomegaly. It has a hereditary autosomic-recessive pattern. Objective: To determine of β-galactosidase acid activity in patients with suspicion of GM- 1 <b>gangliosidosis.</b> Methods: From 1986 to 2006, 1851 patients have been received in our laboratory from all the country, of which 851 had the diagnostic impression of GM- 1 <b>gangliosidosis.</b> In samples from patients, parents and controls, the activity of leukocyte b-galactosidase was determined by a fluorimetric technique (metilumbelliferil derivatives) and leukocyte protein level was determined according to Lowry’s method.

40|$|Diagnosis of GM 1 <b>gangliosidosis</b> (OMIM 230500) {{is usually}} {{based on the}} {{presence}} of physical signs of storage such as coarse facial features, corneal clouding, cherry red macula, hepatosplenomegaly and skeletal dysostosis. More rarely it can present as nonimmune hydrops. We describe a male patient with GM 1 <b>gangliosidosis</b> born to healthy first-cousin parents of Indian Asian descent. The disease was recognized on the basis of diffuse vacuolization of cyto- and syncytiotrophoblasts, stromal cells and amniocytes on histological analysis of the placenta. The placental examination was prompted by the prenatal detection of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) and oligohydramnios at 32 weeks of gestation. The diagnosis of GM 1 <b>gangliosidosis</b> was supported by both biochemical and molecular data. The beta-galactosidase enzymatic activity on leukocytes was severely reduced, while the neuraminidase activity on fibro blasts was normal, thereby excluding galactosialidosis. The molecular analysis of the beta-galactosidase gene (GLB 1) revealed a previously unreported splicing mutation (IVS 1 + 2 insT) in homozygous state. Our case further illustrates the value of histological examination of the placenta in the diagnosis of lysosomal storage disorders and shows that either hydrops or IUGR can be presenting features of GM 1 <b>gangliosidosis</b> in the neonatal period...|$|E

The enzyme deficiency prevents the normal, stepwise degradation of ganglioside, which accumulates unchecked within the cellular lysosome, particularly in neurons. As a result, individuals with GM 2 <b>gangliosidosis</b> experience progressive neurological diseases including motor deficits, progressive weakness and hypotonia, decreased responsiveness, vision deterioration, and seizures. Mice and cats are well-established animal models for Sandhoff disease, whereas Jacob sheep are the only known laboratory animal model of Tay–Sachs disease to exhibit clinical symptoms. Since the human diseases are relatively rare, animal models are indispensable tools for further study of pathogenesis and for development of potential treatments.
