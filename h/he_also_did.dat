5|$|Brown {{formally}} {{described and}} named the species in his 1810 On the Proteaceae of Jussieu. He {{did not identify}} a type specimen, but the one specimen in his collection has since been formally declared the lectotype for the species. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>did</b> not explicitly give an etymology for the specific epithet, but it is accepted that the name derives from the Latin verticillatus ("whorled"), {{in reference to the}} whorled leaf arrangement.|$|E
5|$|Following his one-minute role in Govind Nihalani's Drohkaal (1994), Bajpayee {{acted in}} the biographical drama Bandit Queen (1994). Tigmanshu Dhulia, the casting {{director}} of the film suggested his name to its director Shekhar Kapur. Bajpayee was considered {{for the role of}} dacoit Vikram Mallah in the film, which eventually went to Nirmal Pandey. Bajpayee got the role of dacoit Mann Singh in the film.

5|$|Knittel {{made many}} errors, {{especially}} in Latin text, <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>did</b> not decipher every word and left several lacunae in the reconstructed text (e.g. Romans 11:35; 12:2; 15:8). Tischendorf {{made a new}} and more accurate collation for the Latin text and edited in 1855. Tischendorf used abbreviations for the nomina sacra, he did not leave any lacunae.|$|E

In 1952, Vonnegut's first novel, Player Piano, was published by Scribner's. The novel has a post-Third World War setting, in which factory workers {{have been replaced by}} machines.|$|E
5|$|Priestley {{tried to}} {{continue}} his scientific investigations in America {{with the support of}} the American Philosophical Society. He was hampered by lack of news from Europe; unaware of the latest scientific developments, Priestley was no longer on the forefront of discovery. Although the majority of his publications focused on defending phlogiston theory, <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>did</b> some original work on spontaneous generation and dreams. Despite Priestley's reduced scientific output, his presence stimulated American interest in chemistry.|$|E

5|$|Van Gogh {{used the}} Impressionist concept of broken color to give light to a work, innovatively drawing in color, giving the {{painting}} light and form, as <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>did</b> {{in his paintings}} of plowed fields, mountains, rocks, and heads and figures. The series is unified by a more refined approach, without the thick application of paint {{to which he was}} more accustomed.|$|E
5|$|Baird's first {{press conference}} as a cabinet {{minister}} {{was held in}} July 1999, and was intended to highlight the Harris government's record in reducing the provincial welfare rolls. Baird told reporters that 15,000 people had left the system since the introduction of workfare, and used this figure {{to argue that the}} government's policy was a success. At the time, he lacked information on the number of workfare recipients who actually found jobs, and <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>did</b> not account for 40% of the welfare recipients who had been cut from the list. A number of media reports subsequently criticized both the principle and the implementation of workfare in Ontario.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{published}} a formal description and {{name for the}} species in his 1810 On the Proteaceae of Jussieu. He did not designate a type specimen (a specimen to {{be representative of the}} species) for the species, but the one specimen in his collection has since been formally declared the lectotype for the species. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>did</b> not state the etymology of the specific epithet, but it is accepted that the name derives from the Ancient Greek sphaera- ("round"), and carpos ("fruit"), in reference to the shape of its infructescences.|$|E

5|$|Chamberlin was a {{prolific}} taxonomist who named over 4,000 new animal species in over 400 scientific publications. He specialized in arachnids (spiders, scorpions, and relatives) and myriapods (centipedes, millipedes, and relatives), ranking {{among the most}} prolific arachnologists and myriapodologists in history. He described over 1,400 species of spiders, 1,000 species of millipedes, {{and the majority of}} North American centipedes, although the quantity of his output was not always matched with quality, leaving a mixed legacy to his successors. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>did</b> pioneering ethnobiological studies with the Goshute and other indigenous people of the Great Basin, cataloging indigenous names and cultural uses of plants and animals.|$|E
5|$|Hugh may {{not have}} {{attended}} the coronation of King Henry II of England and his queen Eleanor of Aquitaine. Some sources place him at the coronation, others do not. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>did</b> not attend the Council of Clarendon in 1164 that issued the Constitutions of Clarendon, that {{was the cause of}} the quarrel between the king and Thomas Becket. In the ensuing dispute between the king and Becket, Hugh did not take sides. He was, however, present with Roger de Pont L'Evêque the Archbishop of York at the coronation of the king's eldest son Henry the Young King in 1170, and consequently was suspended by Alexander III. The coronation of the Young King eventually led to Becket's martyrdom in December 1170.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Capello {{returned}} to Milan, subsequently stating Baggio {{was not a}} part of his plans with the club. Baggio chose to move to Parma, but the manager at the time, Carlo Ancelotti, impeded the transfer, as <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>did</b> not feel Baggio would fit into his tactical plans. Ancelotti would later state he regretted this decision, stating that in his naïveté, he believed that the 4–4–2 formation was the ideal formation for success, and he felt that at the time, creative players such as Gianfranco Zola and Baggio were not compatible with this system.|$|E

5|$|Many readers {{praised the}} series for its {{attention}} to detail and realism {{in the area of}} military tactics and procedures. Much of this was due to Hama's military experience (he was drafted into the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers during the Vietnam war), but <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>did</b> a large amount of research in order to be as up-to-date as possible. He frequented Sky Books, a military-oriented bookstore in New York, and read many U.S. Army field manuals and technical manuals, and also credits his friend Lee Russel, a military historian, for helping him with research.|$|E
5|$|Prost was {{partnered with}} fellow Frenchman René Arnoux for 1981. Motor sports author Nigel Roebuck {{reports that there}} were {{problems}} between Prost and Arnoux {{from the start of}} the season, Prost being immediately quicker than his more experienced teammate. He did not finish the first two Grands Prix, due to collisions with Andrea de Cesaris in Long Beach and Didier Pironi at Jacarepaguá, but scored his first podium finish at Buenos Aires. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>did</b> not finish in the next four races, and then won his first Formula One race at his home Grand Prix in France at the fast Dijon circuit, finishing two seconds ahead of his old teammate John Watson.|$|E
5|$|Romney {{attended}} {{public elementary}} schools until the seventh grade, when he enrolled {{as one of}} only a few Mormon students at Cranbrook School, a private upscale boys' preparatory school a few miles from his home. Many students there came from backgrounds even more privileged than his. Not particularly athletic, <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>did</b> not distinguish himself academically. He did participate in his father's successful 1962 Michigan gubernatorial campaign, and later worked as an intern in the Governor's office. Romney took up residence at Cranbrook when his newly elected father began spending most of his time at the state capitol.|$|E

5|$|Terry George was {{the first}} {{director}} to join the project, and <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>did</b> some revisions to the script, but he soon left the project. Peter Berg was the next director to consider, but he too, eventually dropped out for undisclosed reasons. A year later {{it was confirmed that}} Phillip Noyce would direct. Noyce was attracted to Salt for its espionage themes, which are present in most of his filmography, as well as the tension of a character who tries to prove his innocence yet also does what he was previously accused of.|$|E
5|$|A gas-station scene {{within the}} episode {{was meant to}} {{establish}} what the brothers and the series are about—bantering, credit card scams, and classic rock; Kripke feared {{that it would be}} cut because it was character-based and did not further the episode's plot. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>did</b> not want the series to feature ballad music typical of The WB network, and forced the use of classic rock for the soundtrack by writing the music into the script. For the episode's villain, Kripke used the well-known urban legend of the vanishing hitchhiker, but combined it with the Mexican legend of La Llorona to give the spirit more motivation and characterization. The ghost was younger in an earlier version of script, and murdered her parents instead of her children; this was revised to allow for the casting of an older actress.|$|E
5|$|Coolidge {{has often}} been criticized for his actions during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, the worst natural {{disaster}} to hit the Gulf Coast until Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Although he did eventually name Secretary Hoover to a commission in charge of flood relief, scholars argue that Coolidge overall showed {{a lack of interest}} in federal flood control. Coolidge did not believe that personally visiting the region after the floods would accomplish anything, {{and that it would be}} seen as mere political grandstanding. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>did</b> not want to incur the federal spending that flood control would require; he believed property owners should bear much of the cost. On the other hand, Congress wanted a bill that would place the federal government completely in charge of flood mitigation. When Congress passed a compromise measure in 1928, Coolidge declined to take credit for it and signed the bill in private on May 15.|$|E
