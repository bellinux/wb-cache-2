40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is three-folded. First, it aims to study the complex and organic interaction of SSE in the school contexts with reference to uniqueness of Policy, Place and People. Second, it intends to provide a new perspective for the theoretical debate between the managerialists and the critical performativists on the perceived effects of SSE on school improvement or managerial control. Third, it aims at providing an answer to the theoretical debate on the implementation approach of SSE from the top-down, bottom-up or hybrid approaches in policy studies. In this regard, this study presents three research questions: 1. From the perspective of teacher administrators and teachers, how was SSE implemented in the three sample schools? 2. From the perspective of teacher administrators and teachers, what were the perceived effects and/or consequences of SSE? 3. Given these implementation experiences and perceptions, how could the implementation of SSE be accounted for from the perspectives of policy implementation within the policy studies in education? This study was qualitative in nature. Only 3 selected secondary schools experiencing a complete cycle of External School Review (ESR) or Quality Assurance Inspection (QAI) and SSE were studied. The use of descriptive and exploratory approach was adopted. Qualitative design of the study provided a platform for closer exploration into their description of implementation process, perceived effects and implementation approaches of SSE. The research has theoretical implications for the literature of policy implementation, literature of school administration, literature of perceived effects of SSE. Furthermore, this research has policy implications for policy <b>instrumentalisations,</b> policy alienation and instrumental rationalism and policy localisation at schools. Finally, this research ends with practical implications for school administrators. The study investigates how teacher administrators and teachers in Hong Kong secondary schools experienced the implementation process of School Self-Evaluation (SSE), perceived the effects of SSE and described the implementation approach of SSE from the perspectives of policy implementation within the policy studies in education. Given that this area is under-researched in Hong Kong context, the study aims to add to the knowledge base of implementation process, perceived effects and implementation approach of SSE and inform policy administrators of SSE in the government and the schools. There were three arguments made in this study. First, it argued that the implementation of SSE was an organic and complex interaction of the Policy to be implemented, Place where the policy embedded, and the People who implemented the policy. Second, this study argued that the debate between the managerialists and critical performativists might not be applicable to the Hong Kong context. Instead, {{it was found that the}} implementation situation of the school, the biographical and professional background of teachers in which they grew up and socialised and the position of a teacher shaped the perception lens of teachers, through which they perceived the effects of SSE on school improvement or managerial control. The last contribution of this study was to provide interpretations to account for the implementation of SSE. It was argued that the implementation of SSE was neither accounted by the top-down, bottom-up or hybrid approaches, but the complexity of the implementation context including the Policy to be implemented, the Place and the People who implemented the policy.

50|$|His {{works have}} focused on {{political}} Islam and rise of Islamism in Bangladesh. His books God Willing: The Politics of Islamism in Bangladesh (2004) and Islamist Militancy in Bangladesh: A Complex Web (2008) focus on the transformation of a country which was founded {{on the basis of}} a secular principle, but forsook its secularist tradition of centuries in less than a decade and embraced Islam as state religion. The political actors, their strategies, and methods of <b>instrumentalisation</b> of Islam in the third largest Muslim majority country of the world are indicative of how and why the ideology of Islamism appeals, and how domestic, regional and international events influence the dynamics. The findings that the war in Afghanistan between 1979 and 1989, US foreign policy towards the Middle East, and the fifty year regional rivalry between India and Pakistan facilitated this transformation as much as domestic power jockeying made other analysts take pause before presenting simplistic interpretations such as poverty or Muslim exceptionalism as the causes.|$|E
50|$|Particularly {{within the}} public Culture of Remembrance, {{expressions}} {{can be found in}} a variety of initiatives and approaches, for example the archiving of information, its scientific renovation and finally public documentation and other media presentation. Apart from these forms which are more linked to the event itself, other crucial forms of Remembrance Culture are memorial sites, commemoration days and monuments. Certain events, like for example the Historians Dispute provide a rather constant discussion platform for it in the short term but there are many intense social discussions surrounding it from different topic areas. They very quickly touch on political interests and for that reason they are also subjected to a potential <b>instrumentalisation</b> through current affairs. Thereby, questions concerning the Culture of Remembrance, thus the perception of it is closely linked with questions regarding authorizing claims to power and that of creating a national identity. In many cases, this leads to the government ritualization of the Culture of Remembrance and determines a number of taboos in society. The politicization of Erinerungskultur is above all noticeable in regime changes, in which the previous understanding of past events is altered under new leadership. An obvious example is the way in which we approach monuments, which commemorate heroes from past regimes in the past. They however are not honoured in the same way following a change in regime.|$|E
5000|$|For {{cultural}} historian Jeffrey Melnick, Cayce's {{obsession with}} the footage is born out of her exceptional experience of the 9/11 attacks as something which [...] "fundamentally challenged the commercialization of all human experience and emotion". Like the imagery of 9/11, the footage is free of the hegemonic cultural context of the capitalist superstructure and thereby seems to escape commodification, to be beyond [...] "the reified society of brands in which objects assume the status of social relations in contrast to people's objectified ones ... to which Cayce has such an involuntary affinity". Pollard is ever-aware of her complicity as a conduit between the authentic culture {{of the street and}} the reconstructed cultural units manifested as products of branded corporations. Philosopher Nikolas Kompridis casts her desire in terms of a novelty which defies contextualization, positing that Cayce is [...] "yearning for the unconsumably and unsubsumably new", citing a line preceding a description of the footage: [...] "It is as if she participates in the very birth of cinema, that Lumière moment, the steam locomotive about to emerge from the screen, sending the audience fleeing, out into the Parisian night." [...] For Kompridis, the footage is at the crux of Cayce's existential angst as an agent of unearthing novelty and facilitating commodification who also holds out hope for the possibility of a future immune to commodification and <b>instrumentalisation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Three {{members of}} the {{administration}} council (Michel Sitbon, Gilles Alfonsi and Jean-Luc Guilhem) resigned in February 2005, over what {{they consider to be}} an adhesion to the theory of the so-called [...] "Clash of Civilizations", although the Network's publications clearly oppose the theory as a neo-conservative strategy to control the world's last remaining oil reserves, and the <b>instrumentalisation</b> of the network. They object that [...] "With the pretext of resisting American Imperialism, lenience toward Chinese and Russian imperialisms and closeness with Islamists is symptomatic of a latent anti-Semitic drift among the direction." [...] They also claim the existence of links with intelligence agencies, arguing that the Voltaire Network had been constructed against such organizations. However, they also underline that the new stance of the direction shouldn't cause the previous work of the network to be forgotten. Since 2002, these members had been in conflict with Bruno Drweski, director the Communist review La Pensée. These accusations were denied by the Réseau Voltaire, which evokes mere [...] "changes in dimension." [...] Founding member Michel Sitbon cited the arrival of controversial personalities like Claude Karnoouh (who was never actually an administrator) and Bruno Drweski, while the Réseau, in a 2005 declaration, said that [...] "administrators favourable to a French petty political conception of the association have been put in minority.

40|$|On the 8 th of March 2004 the NextGENDERation network made {{a public}} {{statement}} called ‘Not in our names!’. Involved in its making, {{in this article}} I {{give an account of}} the impulses and motivations that pushed us to produce ‘Not in our names!’ The statement is concerned with the <b>instrumentalisation</b> of women’s emancipation for assimilationist, racist, islamophobic and xenophobic agendas. This <b>instrumentalisation</b> is part and parcel both of the belligerent ‘clash of civilizations’ paradigm dominating current geopolitics and of national debates and discourses on ‘integration’ and ‘the multicultural society’ in various West-European countries (specific reference is made to the Dutch context). I also point to the colonial history of this <b>instrumentalisation</b> of women’s emancipation. The complicity between the <b>instrumentalisation</b> and parts of the women’s movement is raised, and in offering some tools to resist colonial feminism (Ahmed) and racist feminism (Lorde), I turn to the critical genealogy of Black feminism. I conclude with a note on the discussion on the headscarf in the Belgian context, characterized by a very marginal recognition for both postcolonial thought and black and migrant feminism. The headscarf debate not only presents itself as symptomatic for a crucial conflict within the women’s movement; it also provides a challenge to appropriate the struggle against racism {{as an integral part of}} the women’s movement. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|This article centres around objectification. It {{offers an}} {{analysis}} of the notions that are involved in this phenomenon, their moral wrongness, as well as the connections that exist between them. Martha Nussbaum has suggested that seven notions are involved in objectification: instrumentality, denial of autonomy, inertness, fungibility, violability, ownership, and denial of subjectivity. She espouses the view that the <b>instrumentalisation</b> of human beings (the treatment of human beings instrumentally to achieve our purposes) is especially problematic as compared to the other ways in which we can treat human beings as objects (for example, denying their autonomy and subjectivity, or treating them as violable). In this paper, I argue against the view that <b>instrumentalisation</b> should be thought of as more suspicious from a moral point of view {{than the rest of the}} ways in which people can be treated as objects. Singling out extreme instrumentality for being especially problematic might lead us to underestimate the wrongness involved in the other ways of treating human beings as objects, and can therefore potentially distort our understanding of what, more generally, is wrong with objectifying human beings...|$|E

Any transformation of space (or <b>instrumentalisation</b> of the space, according to Lefebvre, 2000), therefore, has an impact on social organisation. This impact can only be explained by shifting the analysis towards the means by which space is appropriated 2 or used. In this process, professionals believe they have designed a space for certain uses but in reality something else has taken place. The reflection is based here on the concept of the <b>instrumentalisation</b> of the space elaborated by Lefebvre (2000), who believed that there is an important distinction between what is happening in the space (what is lived and perceived by the inhabitants) and what is done of the space by the urban planning professionals.

40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} adult {{education}} in Britain, {{and other parts}} of the Western world, is undergoing a process of <b>instrumentalisation</b> which is detrimental to its identity and ethos. Opposition to this <b>instrumentalisation</b> requires the development of a theory of adult education which will protect its ethos and identity, and challenge the neo-liberal ideas of the policy-makers who are initiating this process. This theory must not only explain the role of adult education, by locating it in its historical, educational and social context, but also demonstrate its educational and social importance or intrinsic worth. This requires that the theory also satisfies the criteria of theoretical adequacy: the theory must demonstrate explanatory power and reach. An examination of the main traditions of adult education theory in Britain shows that these traditions do not meet these conditions. This thesis argues that Habermas' theory of communicative action can provide the basis for the required theory of adult education. This is demonstrated through a dialogical, methodological approach to the research which reflects Habermas' method in constructing his theory. This approach takes three forms. The detailed, critical study of the Habermasian oeuvre identifies those themes important and relevant to a theory of adult education, and highlights their major strengths and weaknesses. A representative overview of the main critiques of these thematic areas is integrated into this critical study to enable further assessment of the validity of Habermas' theory. This assessment affirms the theoretical adequacy of Habermas' communicative project, but also identifies problematic areas which need further investigation or development if that adequacy is to be strengthened. The thesis then examines the extent to which adult education theorists recognise the possibilities of an Habermasian-informed adult education theory. This examination demonstrates that the overall level of understanding and familiarity with the Habermasian oeuvre, and its important, relevant themes, is not sufficient to satisfy the theoretical conditions identified above. The thesis concludes by drawing from Habermas' work, and from the more relevant interpretations of adult educators and educators, to present a Habermasian-informed adult educational theory which does satisfy these conditions, and thus could provide an effective challenge to the neo-liberal <b>instrumentalisation</b> of adult education currently taking place...|$|E
