40|$|ObjectiveTo {{develop a}} {{research}} productivity scoring program within an academic department of surgery {{that would help}} realign incentives to encourage and reward research. Although research is highly valued in the academic mission, financial incentives are generally aligned to reward clinical productivity. MethodsA formula assigning points for publications and extramural grants was created and used to award a research incentive payment proportional to the research productivity score, beginning July 2007. Publication points reflect journal impact factor, author role, and manuscript type. Grant points reflect total funding and percentage of effort. Publication data were gathered from Web of Science/PubMed/Medline and grants data from the departmental grants office. An annual award is presented to {{the person with the}} greatest improvement. The research productivity score data after July 2007 were compared with control data for the 2 preceding years. A 33 -question survey to 28 clinical faculty was conducted after the first year to measure satisfaction and solicit constructive feedback. ResultsThe mean annual point scores increased from the preresearch productivity score to the postresearch productivity score academic years (2180 vs 3389, respectively, P = . 08), with a significant change in the <b>grant</b> <b>component</b> score (272 vs 801, P = . 03). Since research productivity score implementation, the operative case volumes increased 4. 3 % from 2006 to 2011.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} a {{wide range}} of issues relating to the mix between loans and grants as well as the degree of concessionality of loans. A number of empirical tests are carried out based on annual panel data over 1970 to 1999 for 22 donor countries and 72 recipient countries. Based on the tests, we are able to identify a number of economic and political factors that have influenced donors 2 ̆ 019 past decisions on the grant-loan mix. We also observe that for bilateral donors, past grant-loan mix (and, hence, reflows from past transfers) do not influence the volume of current resource transfers. In addition, we find that loans are better suited than grants in promoting recipient governments budgetary discipline, as is commonly understood in fiscal reform literature. Our tests also show that the rate of official borrowing by the recipients (and, by deduction, the extent of their past debt burden) is positively influenced by the extent of the concessionality of such loans 2 ̆ 014 irrespective of whether it is in the form of subsidized interest rates or longer grace periods. The paper concludes with a review of the circumstances in which grants, soft loans and non-concessional loans might have their respective comparative advantage, as well as a discussion of the need, so as to overcome the negative incentive problems of soft loans, for a typical concessional loan package to be separated into two constituent parts. This would enable the recipient to be given the <b>grant</b> <b>component</b> and the option to take from the non-concessional loan component as much as desired. 2 ̆ 013 aid; ODA; grants; official loans; soft loans; grant element; grace period; bilateral aid; multilateral ai...|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} on the roles that governance/political and economic stability play to attract capital flows into African economies has been burgeoning. Good governance, liberalization, infrastructure, incentive packages have been regarded as cures to break the deadlock to reverse the economic plight, to attract inflow of capital and, in some cases, to reverse outflows of African economies. The flow of capital, however, has undesirable side effects on host economies’ working conditions, environmental standard, inequality, and culture, among others. These economic and social external or negative spillover effects are due to the phenomenon of “race-to-the-bottom” where companies invest in economies with lax regulations and generous incentive packages. Given the highly expected significant economic impacts of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and foreign aid in Africa,, it is becoming clear that the increased inflow of FDI and foreign aid may also have impacts on the political institutions and governance of a nation, especially for the case of economically low income African economies. However, these effects of capital flow on democratic institutions and governance of host economies have not been formally addressed. Using data on governance indicators, FDI, and foreign aid recently made available and other control variables, the present study explores whether FDI and foreign aid promotes or retards governance in African economies. Appropriate estimation techniques that take into account endogeniety in the data as well as heterogeneity of the sample countries are employed. The {{results of the study}} show that foreign aid (official development aid) has had immediate and persistent positive effects during the study period. Flow of FDI also has positive, though weak, effects on governance but with no persistent effect. Other forms of official flow, with less <b>grant</b> <b>component,</b> have both immediate and lag negative effects on governance in African economies...|$|E

40|$|Ethiopia {{is one of}} the {{countries}} receiving large proportions of aid, especially since the introduction of the policy changes (1992) there is a substantial amount of aid flows. This lead to raise government expenditure on various productive activities, contribute either directly to the improvement of economic growth of the country (accelerator) and/or to the development of services (multiplier). In both ways I deem that the undergoing efforts made by the government using aid as an additional resource are contributing to the enhancement of the economic development of the country. But I still argue that the achievements made are not up to the expectation of the government and the donor. Therefore this study is trying to answer the question: What role has aid played in the economic growth and poverty reduction process in Ethiopia since the introduction of policy change (1992 / 93) ? Main hypothesis of this paper falls on the idea of: for aid to be effective, change in policy or development strategy is not the only factor but there are various domestic and foreign factors (aid coordination, allocation and disbursement, and earmarking criteria) that needs more attention. In order to answer this question I used quantitative method; traditional production function with special emphasis to the new (endogenous) growth model. But in order to examine aid effectiveness in a detail manner aid is disaggregated into loan and <b>grant</b> <b>component</b> and is estimated using time series data for the period 1981 to 2003. Following the third generation aid studies this work tried to examine whether aid effectiveness is conditional on policy (macro and institutional) or not. My empirical model is estimated using the Error Correction cointegration approach proposed by Engle and Granger (1987). The findings provide little evidence of aid impacts on intensive economic growth in Ethiopia. According to the model economic growth of the country is influenced by human capital. The result strongly supports the above hypothesis. In the case of intensive growth (considering all variables used in the model in per capita term), there is no significant relationship between aid given in the form of loan and economic growth, but the relationship between aid given in the form of grant and economic growth of Ethiopia is negatively related and significant whereas in the case of extensive growth foreign aid given in the form of grant does have some positive impact on growth...|$|E
