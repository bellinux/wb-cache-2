5|$|After the Battle of Manila, MacArthur {{turned his}} {{attention}} to Yamashita, who had retreated into the mountains of central and northern Luzon. Yamashita chose to fight a defensive campaign, being pushed back slowly by Krueger, and was still holding out at the time the war ended, much to MacArthur's intense annoyance as he had wished to liberate the entire Philippines before the war ended. On 2 September 1945, Yamashita (who had a <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>believing</b> that the Emperor had ordered Japan to sign an armistice) came down from the mountains to surrender with some 100,000 of his men.|$|E
25|$|The Quinlan Quints: four {{quintuplets}} (the fifth {{one went}} missing {{and has never}} been found) who live in Buchans, Newfoundland and Labrador – inspired by the fame of the Dionne quintuplets; portrayed by Cathy Jones, Rick Mercer, Greg Thomey and Mary Walsh (Colin Mochrie plays Mercer's quint role for seasons 9 and 10). Usually interviewed by Mercer's character J.B. Dickson, the Quints would boast about something outlandish that Dickson has a <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>believing</b> until one of the quints (usually Jones) spills the beans and reveals that what they were promoting was really a scam.

25|$|Judith finally convinces Godolphin {{to bring}} her to Yzordderrex {{with the threat of}} leaving him. They head to the retreat where they {{originally}} met, but as Godolphin starts their transference to the second dominion, Dowd comes and interferes and ends up going through to Yzordderrex with Judith instead of Godolphin. They arrive in the house of Peccable, a merchant friend of Godolphin's. Arriving in Yzordderrex, Gentle, Pie and Huzzah encounter an entourage containing the Autarch's Queen, Quaisoir, and Gentle is shocked to find out that her appearance is identical to that of Judith's. With the rebellions in Yzordderrex getting out of control, she flees and Gentle becomes convinced that he has to head to the palace to find out if it's really her. Judith meanwhile has another out of body experience where she witnesses Quaisoir after a fight with the Autarch, who is upset with her becoming enamored with religion, and Father Athanasius, the leader of the 'Dearther' group of rebels (and the man who wed Gentle and Pie at the Cradle). Gentle, Pie and Huzzah arrive at the Eurhetemec Kesperate(district) that Pie is from and find it mostly deserted except for four people, who have a <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>believing</b> that they're not the enemy. Pie tells Gentle and Huzzah to meet him later at a cafe they were eating at. Although Huzzah and Gentle return there, with the chaos going on they leave and encounter a group that includes a Nullianac that kidnaps Huzzah. Gentle chases after them and eventually defeats the Nullianac, but not before it kills Huzzah.|$|E

The album has sold over 500,000 copies, to date. The album received backlash because Usher was singing about sex which the public had a <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>believing</b> {{coming out of a}} 14-year-old's mouth. Again the LaFace had their reservations about signing Usher because the album wasn't as successful as they anticipated.

40|$|This short study aims to {{consider}} how educators might help students to develop metacognitive skills in their writing. Many studies demonstrate that metacognitive skills – in other words, {{the ability to think}} about thinking – are strongly correlated with academic success. Yet often, such studies understand metacognition reductively, as a student’s general awareness of the overall quality of their work, as reflected by a grade. How can educators help students to develop metacognitive awareness of their writing process in their own terms, by paying attention to the singularities and subtleties of their thought, and their creative process as writers? A structured interview of rst year Goldsmiths BA (Hons) Fine Art students aimed to identify what factors impacted how, and whether, students were able to develop student-centered metacognitive parameters to understand their writing processes. The interview revealed how excellent writers make the essay material their own, trust their instincts as to what is important, and consciously enter into dialogue with other thinkers as they engage in the writing process. It also revealed that students’ self-assessment of their strengths and weaknesses in academic writing was coloured by their self-perception as classed subjects. In other words, students who may have had a <b>harder</b> <b>time</b> <b>believing</b> that they belonged in higher education, perhaps due to their self-perceived class position, tended to underestimate their writing abilities; and this had the potential to hinder their writing experience. These findings support an approach to teaching metacognitive writing skills that emphasizes how a student might understand their writing process according to the experience of immersing oneself in – and contributing to – a rich dialogue of ideas and debates that extends beyond their own thinking...|$|R
40|$|Personally, I {{have had}} a <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> intellectually <b>believing</b> {{that there is a}} God. I {{have had a}} <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> {{understanding}} religion or philosophy as somehow approaching the true reality of the universe, somehow getting it right, finding objective truth. It seems to me that any claim about how things are is inherently colored by our human methods, desires, dreams, fears, etc. I understand God less as a metaphysical possibly-existent entity, and more as an embodiment of those dreams, desires, and fears, as a psychological barometer. And so I agree with Nietzsche, contra Plato and Kant, that any hope of actual transcendence of our human contingency and practice, to even point towards the thing-in-itself as part of a separate suprahuman realm, seems flawed. However, I've found this less of a reason to abandon the striving, and more of a reason to examine it, and respect it. I've found this more of a reason to examine the rational behind the very endeavor. After all, as we emphasize a pragmatic focus on human practice, {{it seems to me we}} must't disregard this human practice, the very desire for transcendence of that practice...|$|R
