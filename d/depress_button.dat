50|$|Since {{the release}} of Fasciinatiion, three of the band members, Clark Baechle, Todd Fink and Jacob Thiele have been quietly, with little advertising, {{performing}} under the name <b>Depressed</b> <b>Buttons,</b> playing remixes of other artists, and DJing for various small clubs and venues.|$|R
50|$|The {{push-button}} {{light switch}} has two buttons that alternatively close {{and open the}} contacts. Pushing the raised button opens or closes the contacts and pops out the previously <b>depressed</b> <b>button</b> so the process can be reversed. Push button switch reproductions {{are available on the}} market today for vintage or authentic styling.|$|R
50|$|Some {{shifters}} with a {{shift button}} allow {{the driver to}} freely move the shifter from R to N or D without actually <b>depressing</b> the <b>button.</b> However, the driver cannot shift back to R without <b>depressing</b> the shift <b>button,</b> to prevent accidental shifting which could damage the transmission, especially at high speeds.|$|R
40|$|In {{search of}} {{suitable}} methods {{for measuring the}} affective state of video-game players, this study investigates {{the hypothesis that the}} player’s state of arousal will correspond with the pressure used to <b>depress</b> <b>buttons</b> on a gamepad. A video game was created that would detect the force of each button press during play. It was found that as the difficulty level of the game increased, players would hit the gamepad buttons significantly harder...|$|R
5000|$|List of open windows: Along {{the length}} of the taskbar, open windows are {{represented}} by their corresponding program icons. And once pinned, they will remain even after their respective windows are closed. Until Windows 7, the operating system displayed active windows as <b>depressed</b> <b>buttons</b> in this list. Starting with Windows 7, the icon for each open window is framed by a translucent box, and multiple open windows for the same program can be accessed by clicking the program's icon. However, the taskbar can be changed to function more as it does with older versions of Windows.|$|R
50|$|With some clickers, {{the user}} {{depresses}} the metal directly with thumb or finger; with others, a button extends {{above the surface}} of the casing so that <b>depressing</b> the <b>button</b> makes the metal click.|$|R
50|$|A grenade {{launcher}} {{is located on}} top of the main body, above the pistol grip. The launcher extends upwards, and the spring-loaded grenade is launched by <b>depressing</b> a <b>button</b> {{on the side of the}} rifle.|$|R

50|$|Like most {{professional}} 35 mm cameras of the 1970s, the F-1 had interchangeable viewfinders. To remove the viewfinder, one depressed the two small buttons {{at the rear}} sides of the finder, and slid the finder {{toward the back of}} the camera (or <b>depress</b> one <b>button</b> on the bottom of the Speed Finder).|$|R
50|$|A user could select any {{available}} {{telephone line}} by pressing the appropriate pickup key {{and taking the}} handset off-hook. While on a telephone call, a user could place the call on hold by pressing the hold button, which also released the <b>depressed</b> line <b>button</b> mechanically, enabling the user to select another line for placing a call.|$|R
50|$|The Canonflex was {{inspired}} to an extent by the company's rangefinder camera models. It has a thumb-operated wind-on lever on the camera's base and a removable meterless finder prism, which slides off after <b>depressing</b> a <b>button</b> on the left hand camera front. The rewind release is situated at the base. Long time exposure is accomplished by sliding a switch next to the shutter release to the left, before or while <b>depressing</b> the release <b>button.</b> It must be returned to terminate the exposure. At the right-hand camera front is a wide accessory shoe taking a selenium exposure meter, which couples to the shutter speed dial. The camera stayed in production for one year before it {{was replaced by the}} Canonflex R2000, adding the 1/2000 sec. shutter speed.|$|R
50|$|The {{rear wheels}} of {{self-propelled}} wheelchairs typically range from 20-24 inches (51-61 cm)in diameter, and commonly resemble bicycle wheels. Wheels are rubber-tired {{and may be}} solid, pneumatic or gel-filled. The wheels of folding chairs may be permanently attached, but those for rigid chairs are commonly fitted with quick-release axles activated by <b>depressing</b> a <b>button</b> at {{the centre of the}} wheel.|$|R
50|$|The SPAS-12 was {{designed}} to function primarily as a semi-automatic firearm, with the pump-action mode used to reliably fire low-pressure ammunition such as tear gas rounds or less-lethal bean bags. The firing mode is switched by <b>depressing</b> the <b>button</b> under the foregrip and also sliding the foregrip forwards or backwards until it clicks into position allowing the rotating sleeve to open or close the two gas ports.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} features of the Z9 is the gull wing door, though unusually conventional doors are also fitted into the gull wings, allowing the doors to function in both ways. The full-length gull wing doors can be opened automatically at the press of a button on the electronic key. <b>Depressing</b> the <b>button</b> on the remote control will both open and close a door.|$|R
50|$|Archery - Firing of {{the arrow}} {{controlled}} by action button; the elevation angle {{is controlled by}} <b>depressing</b> the action <b>button</b> and releasing at the proper time. There are three attempts at passing the qualifying score.|$|R
50|$|Three-row concertinas add a {{third row}} of accidentals (i.e., sharps and flats not {{included}} in the keys represented by the two main rows) and redundant notes (i.e., notes that duplicate those in the main keys but are located in the third, outermost row) that enable the instrument to be played in virtually any key. A series of sequential notes can be played in the home-key rows by <b>depressing</b> a <b>button,</b> compressing the bellows, <b>depressing</b> the same <b>button</b> and extending the bellows, moving to the next button and repeating the process, and so on. A consequence of this arrangement is that the player often encounters occasions requiring a change in bellows direction, which produces a clear separation between the sounds of the two adjacent notes. This tends to give the music a more punctuated, bouncy sound that can be especially well suited to hornpipes or jigs.|$|R
50|$|The New F-1 {{system has}} 5 {{different}} viewfinders, {{which can be}} quickly and easily changed by <b>depressing</b> the two <b>buttons</b> on {{the rear of the}} finder, pulling it off the camera body, and pushing the new finder into place.|$|R
50|$|Lamy {{produces}} multisystem pens, which {{combine a}} ballpoint and another feature within the one pen, {{such as the}} Pickup, which integrates a ballpoint and a highlighter into one body. The highlighter is released {{from the body of}} the pen by <b>depressing</b> a <b>button</b> on the body of the pen, and can be reinserted into the body of the pen. The Pickup was also designed by Wolfgang Fabian, and has won the red dot award for product design.|$|R
50|$|In 1949, AT&T commercialized Mobile Telephone Service. From {{its start}} in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1946, AT&T {{introduced}} Mobile Telephone Service {{to one hundred}} towns and highway corridors by 1948. Mobile Telephone Service was a rarity with only 5,000 customers placing about 30,000 calls each week. Calls were set up manually by an operator and the user had to <b>depress</b> a <b>button</b> on the handset to talk and release the button to listen. The call subscriber equipment weighed about 80 lb.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} type of {{audiometer}} generates pure tones, or transmits parts of speech.Another kind of audiometer is the Bekesy audiometer, in which the subject follows a tone of increasing and decreasing amplitude as the tone is swept through the frequency range by <b>depressing</b> a <b>button</b> when the tone is heard and releasing it when it cannot be heard, crossing {{back and forth over the}} threshold of hearing. Bekesy audiometry typically yields lower thresholds and standard deviations than pure tone audiometry.|$|R
50|$|Being an ex-SEAL, John Mayor {{is able to}} use {{all sorts}} of {{firearms}} and so, the player can move while armed and automatically lock on to enemies by <b>depressing</b> the aim <b>button.</b> There is an option for the player to switch manually between targets.|$|R
50|$|The {{paper tape}} {{recording}} was driven {{directly by the}} wheels of the locomotive, with the paper spool moving at a fixed rate per kilometre travelled. Three graphs were recorded, the first being time elapsed (with the trace moving vertically if the train was stationary), the second being a speed curve. and the third recording the driver's attentiveness to signals ("Vigilance") by marking one tick above a line when the driver <b>depressed</b> a <b>button,</b> and another below the line when the engine went over the signal ramp.|$|R
40|$|Digital (avoid PDAs; {{use only}} high quality image capable cell phone {{if this is}} the only camera option available) Minimum 800 X 600 pixels; {{preferred}} resolution of 1024 X 768 pixels or greater (about 0. 8 Megapixels) Macro mode capability is ideal (“flower ” image) 3. TAKING THE IMAGE Background- Use a solid, neutral color perpendicular to camera angle. Lighting- Diffuse, indirect light is best. Avoid shadows. Indoors – fluorescent day-light or full spectrum bulbs are best (avoid incandescent). Outdoors – use well-lit, but evenly shaded area if sunny. Flash- Helps to eliminate shadows. Test to see if needed. May cause white-out if too close. Compression- Use JPEG medium or low setting (no more than 20 : 1). Focus- Adjust camera and patient to have camera angle perpendicular to the skin lesions being imaged. Use auto-focus with area of interest in center of frame. If not possible, focus first on the area of interest, <b>depress</b> shutter <b>button</b> half-way to focus, then move the camera to center the image before fully <b>depressing</b> shutter <b>button.</b> Views- Take to show location and arrangement of lesions. Take several views o Far- entire body or obvious region o Medium- area involved central but include an anatomical landmark such as the navel or han...|$|R
50|$|The {{chromatic}} harmonica {{is a type}} of harmonica {{that uses}} a button-activated sliding bar to redirect air from the hole in the mouthpiece to the selected reed-plate desired. When the button is not pressed, an altered diatonic major scale of the key of the harmonica is available, while <b>depressing</b> the <b>button</b> accesses the same scale a semitone higher in each hole. Thus, the instrument is capable of playing the 12 notes of the Western chromatic scale. The chromatic harmonica can thus be contrasted with a standard harmonica, which can play only the notes in a given musical key.|$|R
50|$|One {{variation}} was {{the press}} button can, which featured two pre-cut buttons—one small and one large—in {{the top of}} the can sealed with a plastic membrane. These buttons were held closed by the outward pressure of the carbonated beverage. The consumer would open the can by <b>depressing</b> both <b>buttons,</b> which would result in two holes. The small hole would act as a vent to relieve internal pressure so the larger button could then be pressed down to create the hole used for drinking the beverage. Consumers could also easily cut themselves on the edges of the holes or get their fingers stuck.|$|R
50|$|The rifle uses stamped {{upper and}} lower {{assemblies}} held together by a pin at the front and a button at the rear. <b>Depressing</b> the <b>button</b> allows the two main assemblies to separate so the bolt can be removed and the internal parts accessed. The safety is a lever located inside the trigger guard, which both blocks the firing mechanism and locks the bolt in the forward position when flipped down. The trigger mechanism is the type popular in some submachine guns, where a partial pull will fire single shots and a complete pull will fire full auto.|$|R
5000|$|Twelve of Willis' color slides with {{descriptions}} {{served as}} [...] "Willis Exhibit 1" [...] for the Warren Commission. Willis {{testified to the}} Commission that his fifth photo was inadvertently snapped when, just after he had prepared his 35mm Argus camera to capture a photo, he was suddenly startled by a gunshot related noise (the first of three shots he remembered hearing), and his finger that {{was already on the}} camera shutter button reacted to the gunshot related noise, then, he quickly <b>depressed</b> the <b>button</b> and the fifth photo was captured. As documented by the House Select Committee on Assassinations, this fifth photo was captured concurrent with Zapruder film frame 202.|$|R
50|$|The first {{staircase}} timers were pneumatic pushbuttons. A large push-button, distinctly {{larger than}} a normal electrical switch, is pressed manually. An internal mechanism provides the delay. The internal piston is <b>depressed</b> by the <b>button</b> and holds the electrical contacts closed. This piston is spring-loaded to return upwards but is prevented from returning quickly by a pneumatic dashpot. This dashpot provides the timing function.|$|R
5000|$|... ==Gameplay== <b>Depress</b> {{the fire}} <b>button</b> for a missile. The missile speed {{increases}} when <b>depressing</b> the fire <b>button</b> continuously. Guide the missile from a stationary launch pad {{to the top}} of the screen to blow up the invading fleet of armed UFOs while dodging meteorites and bombs. Points are awarded for blowing up various ships and range from 50-550 depending on the ship. There is a bonus chance of 600 points for one pattern. After clearing a level or [...] "pattern" [...] as the back of the flyer calls it, the player was rewarded with messages like [...] "Good!!" [...] after 3 screens cleared, [...] "Very Good!!" [...] after 7 screens cleared, [...] "Wonderful!!" [...] after 10 screens cleared, and [...] "Fantastic!!" [...] after 15 screens cleared. Players who failed to score any points were told to [...] "Give Up!!" [...] A launcher appears every 3,000 additional points (5,000 if the adjustment is made in the controlling dip switches in the arcade cabinet).|$|R
50|$|Aerosol paint (also called spray paint) {{is a type}} {{of paint}} that comes in a sealed {{pressurized}} container and is released in a fine spray mist when <b>depressing</b> a valve <b>button.</b> A form of spray painting, aerosol paint leaves a smooth, evenly coated surface. Standard sized cans are portable, inexpensive and easy to store. Aerosol primer can be applied directly to bare metal and many plastics.|$|R
50|$|Car glass {{includes}} windscreens, {{side and}} rear windows, and glass panel roofs on a vehicle. Side windows {{can be either}} fixed or be raised and lowered by <b>depressing</b> a <b>button</b> (power window) or switch or using a hand-turned crank. The power moonroof, a transparent, retractable sunroof, may be considered {{as an extension of}} the power window concept. Some vehicles include sun blinds for rear and rear side windows. The window shield of a car is appropriate for safety and protection of debri in the road. It also comforts the driver as well. The majority of car glass is held in place by glass run channels, which also serve to contain any fragments of glass if the glass breaks.|$|R
5000|$|Spray paint (scientific name {{aerosol paint}} [...] ) {{is a type}} of paint that comes in a sealed {{pressurized}} container and is released in a Aerosol spray when <b>depressing</b> a valve <b>button.</b> Spray paint leaves a smooth, evenly coated surface, unlike many traditional rolled or brushed paints. Standard sized cans are lightweight, portable, cheap, and easy to store. Aerosol primer can be applied directly to bare metal and many plastics.|$|R
2500|$|A {{standard}} fitting on single-hose second stages, both mouth-held {{and built}} into a full-face mask or demand helmet, is the purge-button, which allows the diver to manually deflect the diaphragm to open the valve and cause air to flow into the casing. This is usually used to purge the casing [...] or full-face mask of water if it has flooded. This will often happen if the second stage is dropped or removed from the mouth while under-water. It is either a separate part mounted in the front cover or the cover may be made flexible and serves as the purge <b>button.</b> <b>Depressing</b> the purge <b>button</b> presses against the diapragm directly over the lever of the demand valve, and this movement of the lever opens the valve to release air through the regulator. The tongue {{may be used to}} block the mouthpiece during purging to prevent water or other matter in the regulator from being blown into the diver's airway by the air blast. This is particularly important when purging after vomiting through the regulator.|$|R
50|$|There were {{no further}} circus related {{releases}} until the Jean Richard Circus Set (GS48) which was issued in November 1978. This large set included {{models of the}} new 1/36 scale Land Rover Estate and Chevrolet Van which had been updated to become a parade vehicle and mobile booking office respectively. Also included were an animal cage trailer and models of horses and an elephant and figures of a clown and a ringmaster, together with various Big Top accessories. The most interesting model, however, was the Berliet tractor unit which had been adapted to become a human cannonball launcher complete with die-cast cannon attached to the rear and a human cannonball figure that could be fired from the cannon by means of <b>depressing</b> a <b>button.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{joystick}} {{is required}} for control, and the player <b>depresses</b> the firing <b>button</b> to fire the machine gun, which carries enough ammunition for 99 shots. Nazis require two well-placed shots to eliminate, and Nazis {{sitting at a table}} only require one well-placed shot. The player can sustain up to 50 shots from enemy soldiers. While inside the castles, the player finds crates which may contain art objects or explosives. The player can also find ammunition dumps, first-aid kits, and goods in the castles.|$|R
5|$|Combat {{occurs in}} real-time, and the player {{character}} may use both melee and ranged weapons. The player attacks by holding the cursor over the game screen and clicking, <b>depressing</b> the <b>button</b> longer to inflict greater damage. Some weapons allow for {{different types of}} attacks depending on where the cursor is held; for example, clicking {{near the bottom of}} the screen may result in a jab, while clicking in the middle produces a slash. Simulated dice rolls occur behind the scenes to determine weapon accuracy. Enemies sometimes try to escape when near death, and the game's stealth mechanics may occasionally be used to avoid combat altogether. The player may cast spells by selecting an appropriate combination of runestones. Like mantras, runestones must be found in the game world before use. There are over forty spells, some undocumented; their effects range from causing earthquakes to allowing the player character to fly.|$|R
