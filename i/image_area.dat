5|$|To avoid violating Edison's patents, Biograph cameras from 1895 to 1902 used a large-format film {{measuring}} 2-23/32 inches (68mm) wide, with an <b>image</b> <b>area</b> of 2 × 2½ inches, {{four times}} that of Edison's 35mm format. Biograph film was not ready-perforated; the camera itself punched a sprocket hole {{on each side of}} the frame as the film was exposed at 30 frames per second. Sherlock Holmes Baffled ran to 86.56 metres in length, giving the film a running time of 30 seconds (although in practice, due to the hand-cranked gearing of the Mutoscope this would have varied).|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, {{the motion}} picture {{industry}} was threatened by the advent of television—TV kept moviegoers at home, reducing box office revenues. Film studios sought to lure audiences to theaters with attractions that television could not provide. These included a revival of color films, three-dimensional films, stereophonic sound, and widescreen movies. Cinerama {{was one of the}} first widescreen movie processes of the era. In its initial conception, the cumbersome system required three cameras for shooting and three synchronized projectors to display a picture on one wide, curved screen. Along with the logistical and financial challenges of tripling equipment usage and cost, the process led to distracting vertical lines between the three projected images. Looking for a high-impact method of widescreen filmmaking that was cheaper, simpler, and less visually distracting, 20th Century Fox acquired the rights to a process it branded CinemaScope: in this system, the film was shot with anamorphic lenses. The film was then exhibited with a complementary anamorphic lens on the projector that expanded the image, creating a projected aspect ratio (the ratio of the image's width to its height) twice that of the <b>image</b> <b>area</b> on the physical frame of film. By the time the first CinemaScope movie—The Robe (1953)—was announced for production, Gottschalk, Moore and Nicholson had a demo reel of work with their anamorphic underwater system.|$|E

The MGM Camera 65 used special 65mm Eastmancolor film stock with a 2.76:1 aspect ratio. 70mm {{anamorphic}} camera lenses developed by the Mitchell Camera Company were manufactured to specifications submitted by MGM. These lenses squeezed the image down 1.25 times to fit on the <b>image</b> <b>area</b> of the film stock. Because the film could be adapted to the requirements of individual theaters, movie houses did not need to install special, expensive 70mm projection equipment. Six of the 70mm lenses, each worth $100,000, were shipped to Rome for use by the production.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{effective}} segmentation algorithm of <b>image</b> lesion <b>areas</b> in Department of Internal Medicine is {{an important}} problem {{in the field of}} medical imaging. The current segmentation techniques of <b>image</b> lesion <b>areas</b> in Department of Internal Medicine are using the difference characters of edge pixels, due to visceral adhesions, the segmentation threshold is difficult to be accurately defined, and the precision is low. Therefore, this paper proposed a segmentation method of <b>image</b> lesion <b>areas</b> in Department of Internal Medicine based on improved cuckoo search algorithm to optimize maximum entropy. Firstly, by the maximum entropy method to find segmentation objective function of <b>image</b> lesion <b>areas</b> in Department of internal medicine, then the improved cuckoo search algorithm is adopted to optimize the objective function, find the best segmentation position of <b>image</b> lesion <b>area</b> in Department of internal medicine, so as to achieve <b>image</b> lesion <b>area</b> segmentation, finally multiple images of internal medicine are utilized to conduct simulation experiment, in order to test the performance of the proposed algorithm. The results show that, this method not only solves the defects existing in the traditional segmentation algorithm, while improving the precision of <b>image</b> lesion <b>area</b> of internal medicine, has better robustness, and better practical value...|$|R

After the MRI scanning, native brain scans (nat) were reoriented into the two different artificial planes (anterior commissure – posterior commissure axis (AC-PC) and hippocampal horizontal long axis (hipp)).
