5|$|SkyClan and the Stranger is a trilogy {{detailing}} events {{experienced by}} SkyClan after its revival in Firestar's Quest {{and the events}} of SkyClan's Destiny. It also details how Sol came {{to know about the}} Clans. The trilogy begins with The Rescue, which was released on 5 July 2011. The second book <b>is</b> <b>Beyond</b> <b>the</b> Code and was released 22 November 2011, and the third book is After the Flood and was released 3 April 2012.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{structure}} of the charted regions of the Solar System consists of the Sun, four relatively small inner planets surrounded by a belt of mostly rocky asteroids, and four giant planets surrounded by the Kuiper belt of mostly icy objects. Astronomers sometimes informally divide this structure into separate regions. The inner Solar System includes the four terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt. The outer Solar System <b>is</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> asteroids, including the four giant planets. Since {{the discovery of the}} Kuiper belt, the outermost parts of the Solar System are considered a distinct region consisting of the objects beyond Neptune.|$|E

25|$|The nasal {{lining of}} the distal two-thirds of the nose can be covered with {{anteriorly}} based septal mucosal flaps; however, if bilateral septal-flaps are used, the septal cartilage does become devascularized, possibly from iatrogenic septal perforation. Furthermore, if the nasal defect <b>is</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> wound-correction scope of a septal mucosal flap, the alternative techniques are either an inferiorly based pericranial-flap (harvested from the frontal bone) or a free flap of temporoparietal fascia (harvested from the head), either {{of which can be}} lined with free grafts of mucosa to achieve the nasal reconstruction.|$|E
