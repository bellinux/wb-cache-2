40|$|The normal {{distribution}} based likelihood ratio (LR) statistic {{is widely used}} in structural equation modeling.

By extending results in the literature, this paper develops {{normal distribution}}s to describe the behavior of the LR statistic for mean and covariance structure analysis. A sequence of local alternative hypotheses is not necessary for the proposed distributions to be asymptotically valid.

Since efficient human resources are the greatest and most important assets of all organizations, they constantly work to train, retain, and get the best of these valuable assets. The main objective of this work was to prioritize the motivational factors and satisfaction of the volunteer forces participating in treatment and health programs in the case of emergencies. Materials and Methods: The study population of this research was all volunteers (N= 600) in treatment and health programs of Kerman Province. Using the Morgan Table, 360 subjects were selected. The data-gathering instrument was Andam’s questionnaire of motivational factors with reliability of 0. 94, and Galindo-Kuhn and Guzley (2001) questionnaire of satisfaction with reliability of 0. 92. To determine research data <b>distribution,</b> <b>Kolmogorov-Smirnov</b> test was applied. Moreover, for data analysis inferential statistics tests of Friedman, Mann–Whitney U, and Kruskal–Wallis were used at significance level of P< 0. 05. Results: The present research revealed that the most and least important motivational factors in volunteers of treatment and health units were purposeful motivation and financial motivation with average rankings of 5. 45 and 1. 99, respectively. In addition, among the satisfaction factors, the volunteers reported communication with volunteers and organizational communication as the most and least important satisfaction factors, respectively. The results of this research indicated that the female volunteers participated in volunteer activities with greater occupational, support, progress, and social motivations. In addition, single participants had greater occupational, social, and financial motivations towards participation in these activities as compared to married participants. Conclusion: The results of this research revealed that to absorb a higher number of volunteers in health and treatment organizations, commitment and purposeful aspects must be emphasized on, as by improving the motivational and satisfaction factors, we can expect that satisfaction and retention level increases in volunteers.

The second group consisted 1571 patients irradiated from February 1 st, 2002 and included respectively: head and neck – 407, breast – 309, gynaecology – 681 and the lung – 309. Doses were calculated with the use of the Cadplan planning system and measured with semiconductor detectors: PTW Freiberg for photons 6 – 12 MV, Sun Nuclear Insured for photons 1 – 4 MV and 15 – 20 MV. The detectors were placed in a central axis at the entry. The institutional protocol implemented during the period between two evaluated groups of patients required that doses had to be measured during the first week of the treatment. The next measurement was performed in the middle of the radiotherapy course. Additional dose checks were done after any modification of the fields and on the request of the clinician or physicist.

MÉTODOS: Foram examinados trinta e oito olhos de 19 pacientes pela manhã (9 am) e à tarde (6 pm), obtendo-se refração esfero-cilíndrica dinâmica, acuidade visual (logMAR) sem correção (AVsc) e corrigida (AVcc) e parâmetros do ORA (Ocular Response Analyzer) : histerese corneana (corneal {{hysteresis}} - CH), fator de resistência da córnea (corneal {{resistance factor}} - CRF), pressão intraocular (intraocular pressure &- IOP) calibrada para o padrão Goldmann (IOPg) e pressão compensada da córnea (IOPcc). Considerando a não distribuição normal das variáveis (teste de Kolmogorov-Smirnov), o teste de Wilcoxon signed rank foi utilizado para verificar significância nas diferenças entre as medidas da manhã e as da tarde de cada variável. O teste de Spearman foi utilizado para verificar correlações das medidas do ORA com o estado refracional e com a acuidade visual pela manhã e à tarde, assim como para verificar as correlações entre as medidas do ORA pela manhã e à tarde e as variações da refração e da acuidade visual. RESULTADOS: Grau esférico (E), equivalente esférico (EE), equivalente desfoco (ED), AVsc, IOPcc e IOPg variaram significativamente (Wilcoxon, p PURPOSE: To verify {{the morning to}} evening variations of refraction, visual acuity, intraocular pressure and biomechanical parameters on patients operated by radial keratotomy who presented for refractive re-treatments; and to correlate the biomechanical parameters with refraction, visual acuity and their variations among morning and evening. METHODS: 19 patients were examined, respectively thirty-eight eyes in the morning (9 am) and evening (6 pm), recording sphere-cylindrical dynamic refraction, visual acuity (logMAR) without correction (AVsc) and corrected (AVcc) and ORA (Ocular Response Analyzer) parameters: corneal hysteresis (CH), corneal resistance factor (CRF), intraocular pressure calibrated for Goldmann (IOPg) e corneal compensated (IOPcc). Variables had no normal <b>distribution</b> (<b>Kolmogorov-Smirnov</b> test), so that the Wilcoxon signed rank was used for testing the significance on the differences for each variable between morning and afternoon. The Spearman test was used for assessing {{the correlations between the}} ORA parameters and refraction, visual acuity in the morning and afternoon, as well as to verify the correlations between the ORA parameters and the variations on refraction and visual acuity. RESULTS: Sphere (E), spherical equivalent (EE), defocus equivalent (ED), AVsc, IOPcc e IOPg varied significantly (Wilcoxon, p< 0. 05) between morning and evening. There was more hyperopia, worse visual acuity, higher pressure and lower CH in the morning measurements. In the morning measurements, there was a positive correlation (Spearman, p< 0. 05) between EE and ED and IOPcc (rs= 0. 39 and 0. 34 respectively), but not with IOPg. In the evening measurement, there were no correlations between the refractive and pressure measurements. Negative correlations were observed (Spearman, p< 0. 05) between AVsc (logMAR) and CH in the morning and in the evening (rs= - 0. 48 e rs= - 0, 51), between E and CH in the morning and in the evening (rs= - 0. 66 and - 0. 76), between E and CRF in the morning and in the evening (rs= - 0. 40 and - 0. 47), between EE and CH in the morning and in the evening (rs= - 0. 70 and - 0. 68), between EE and CRF in the morning and in the evening (rs= - 0. 41 and - 0. 46), between ED and CH in the morning and in the evening (rs= 0. 64 and - 0. 54) and between ED and CRF in the morning and in the evening (rs= - 0. 35 and - 0. 34). There was a significant negative correlation between the morning measurement of CRF and the variation of defocus equivalent (p = 0. 05; rs = - 0. 30) and the variation of AVsc (p = 0. 04; rs = - 0. 33). CONCLUSION: More hyperopia was recorded in the morning which was associated with higher compensated pressure (IOPcc) but not with IOPg ten years after RK. Lower biomechanical parameters (CRF e CH) were associated with higher hyperopia and worse visual acuity. A trend was observed for having higher fluctuation on weaker corneas. New studies involving the variables derived from the waveform signals, beyond CH and CRF (derived from the applanation pressures) along with data from corneal tomography and wavefront aberrometry are necessary...|$|R
40|$|The Dungeness is {{a popular}} food and the most commercially {{important}} crab in the western states in the U. S. Like all agricultural production, the crab fisherman face yield risks and must manage these risks. In addition to weather risk, crab fisherman may experience low yields if the crabs are over fished in previous years. Farmers for many traditional agricultural crops can purchase crop insurance to insure against low yields. However, crab fishermen at this time do not have this option. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to estimate a fair insurance premium based on the historical yields of the Dungeness crab. This information can then be used in risk/return models for crab fishing to determine if it would be optimal for fisherman to purchase crop insurance. An important input into the fair insurance premium estimation is the yield distribution. Sherrick et al. estimated alternative yield distributions to evaluate traditional crop insurance. However, no one has looked at the yield distributions for the Dungeness crab nor explored possible crop insurance. Much of the past literature for the fishing industry has focused on production functions, cost function models, and optimal catching yields for specific fish species. Moreover, most research has focused on the endangered commercial ocean species such as tuna and swordfish. Data and Methodology This research collects the annual landing data including metric tons, pounds, and price per pound from NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries Service) to analyze the yield distributions of Dungeness crab in California, Oregon, Washington, and Alaska from 1950 to 2009. Dickey Fuller test is conducted for each state to test if the data is stationary. The Durbin-Watson test was used to make sure the data did not have autocorrelation problems. We find that the detrended data has positive Skewness contrary to traditional crop yield data. The positive Skewness indicates that the tail on the right sides is longer than the left side and the mass of the distribution is concentrated on the left. It also has relatively few high values. The candidate distributions used include normal, Gamma, Weibull, logistic, lognormal, and loglogistic distributions. The fitted distributions are compared with formal goodness- of- fit tests including Chi-Square, Anderson-Darling, and <b>Kolmogorov-Smirnov.</b> The loglogistic <b>distribution</b> is best to estimate the yield losses of Alaska, Oregon, and California respectively while the logistic is best for Washington. The Gamma and normal distribution are the worst for the four states. Actual Production History (APH) policies insure crop producers against yield losses due to natural causes. After Just and Weninger found that crop yield losses were nonnormally distributed, many agricultural researchers use parametric (Goodwin and Ker) and nonparametric distributions (Sherrick et al) and the insured price to estimate the insurance premium. The premium refers to the periodic payment made on the insurance policy. When the yields are below the insured level (the predicted level each year), the insurance company has to pay indemnities to the producers to compensate them for their losses. Our study uses different parametric distributions to forecast the crab yields. Along with the yield distributions and yield forecasts, we assume that the crop insurance insures up to 80 % of the yield distribution. We also assume that the insured price is the predicted price per pound for 2010 (since the price model are Pth-order autoregressive (AR(p)) processes) to estimate the fair insurance premium. The insured prices per pound of the four states from north to south are $ 1. 88, $ 2. 39, $ 1. 94, and $ 1. 99 respectively. If the random value (that the realized yields fall below the guaranteed yields) generated by the best distributions which may generate different parametric value for the four states falls below zero, it will means that the fisherman suffer yield losses, and that the insurance company has to compensate the fishermen’s revenue. The insurance company pays the fishermen the dollars that the insured price times 80 % of the yield that the fishermen suffer from loss. The indemnities will be either zero or positive. Next, we adopt Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) to simulate the indemnities 500 times to calculate the average indemnities. If we don’t consider the capital and administration fees of the insurance company, the average indemnities will be the actuarially fair insurance premium. The average indemnity and thus the actuarially fair premiums of the overall crab industry are $ 1, 380, 924, $ 702, 344, $ 2, 823, 855, and $ 3, 470, 998 one year for the all ships in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, and California respectively. Unlike traditional crop insurance that estimates the premium per acre, we use the total premium shared by all fishing vessels in the state and account for the total tons that the fishing vessels load because the crabs and the fishing vessel move everywhere. After simulated, half of the time the insurance company must pay indemnities. To avoid the high risk of yield losses and uncertainty, the existence of insurance is necessary to protect the fishermen’s revenue. Finally, we will try to use non-parametric method to estimate the fair premium and compare the results of the parametric and non-parametric distributions for the rigorous study. We will also estimate the potential welfare gain of fishermen from this insurance policy.
