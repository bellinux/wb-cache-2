5|$|<b>For</b> <b>live</b> shows, The White Stripes {{were known}} for Jack's {{employment}} of heavy distortion, {{as well as}} audio feedback and overdrive. The duo performed considerably more recklessly and unstructured live, never preparing set lists for their shows, believing that planning too closely would ruin the spontaneity of their performances.|$|E

5|$|A recent {{economics}} {{report says}} that the music industry in Italy made €2.3 billion in 2004. That sum refers to the sale of CDs, music electronics, musical instruments, and ticket sales <b>for</b> <b>live</b> performances; it represents a 4.35% growth over 2004. The actual sale of music albums has decreased slightly, {{but there has been}} a compensatory increase in paid-for digitally downloaded music from industry-approved sites. By way of comparison, the Italian recording industry ranks eighth in the world; Italians own 0.7 music albums per capita as opposed to the USA, in first-place with 2.7.

5|$|After {{signing a}} {{recording}} contract with EMI Latin in 1989, the label denied Selena a requested crossover after she made three demonstration recordings. After her Grammy Award nomination <b>for</b> <b>Live</b> (1993) was announced, Selena signed with SBK Records to begin recording her crossover album, which was front-page news in Billboard magazine. In March 1994, she released Amor Prohibido; in interviews {{she said her}} English-language album was still being developed. Recording sessions for Dreaming of You began in December 1994; Selena recorded four tracks slated for the album. On March 31, 1995, she was shot dead by Yolanda Saldívar, the former manager of her Selena Etc. boutiques over a dispute about claims of embezzlement.|$|E
5|$|As La Dispute have {{promoted}} {{their music}} on headline tours {{they have tried}} to create a play different songs and create a different experience for each live show. They have also used songs after a certain period of time: an example is 'King Park', which although was initially considered too emotionally draining <b>for</b> <b>live</b> performances, the band eventually started to play the song live. The band played 'St Paul Missionary Baptist Church Blues' from Wildlife at its first performance in September 2012.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1992 Parry favoured a deal with ITV, but thought the network {{should be prepared to}} pay up towards £30 million <b>for</b> <b>live</b> football. At a meeting in January 1992, Dyke made it clear ITV would not be positioned as they were already paying too much for football. He and executive director Trevor East commented on BSkyB's debt and felt the company would be forced to increase their borrowing if they were awarded a contract. This did not dissuade Quinton, who urged Murdoch to bid. Quinton even informed Chisholm that there were no bidding rules.|$|E

Fleming conducted research <b>for</b> <b>Live</b> and Let Die, and completed the novel before Casino Royale {{was published in}} January 1953, four months before his second book was published. Fleming and his wife Ann flew to New York before taking the Silver Meteor train to St. Petersburg in Florida and then flying on to Jamaica. In doing so they followed the same train route Fleming had taken with his friend Ivar Bryce in July 1943, when Fleming had first visited the island.|$|E
5|$|Beyond {{recognition}} {{on their}} albums and concerts; his unauthorised {{use of other}} artists' works has led to disputes with musicians, most notably with Rickie Lee Jones. During their live shows of the 1990s, the Orb performed using digital audio tape machines optimised <b>for</b> <b>live</b> mixing and sampling before switching to laptops and digital media. Despite changes in performance method, the Orb maintained their colourful light shows and psychedelic imagery in concert. These visually intense performances prompted critics to compare the group to Pink Floyd.|$|E

5|$|Due to the band's slow progress, Shields {{contemplated}} relocating to New York City, {{where members}} of his family were living at the time. However, Creation Records co-founder Joe Foster had decided to establish his own record label, Kaleidoscope Sound and persuaded My Bloody Valentine to record and release an EP. The New Record by My Bloody Valentine, produced by Foster, was released in October 1986 and was a minor success, peaking at number 22 on the UK Indie Chart upon its release. On the strength of the release, the band began performing more frequent shows, later developing a small following and travelling outside London <b>for</b> <b>live</b> performances, supporting and opening for bands such as The Membranes.|$|E
