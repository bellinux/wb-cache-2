5000|$|The idea of <b>eco-innovation</b> {{is fairly}} recent. One {{of the first}} {{appearances}} {{of the concept of}} <b>eco-innovation</b> in the literature is in the book by Claude Fussler and Peter James. In a subsequent article, Peter James defines <b>eco-innovation</b> as [...] "new products and processes which provide customer and business value but significantly decrease environmental impacts". Klaus Rennings introduces the term <b>eco-innovation</b> addressing explicitly three kinds of changes towards sustainable development: technological, social and institutional innovation.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{position}} held (for example, by {{the organisation}} Eco Innovation) {{is that this}} definition should be complemented: eco-innovations should also bring greater social and cultural acceptance. In this view, this [...] "social pillar" [...] added to James's definition is necessary because it determines learning {{and the effectiveness of}} eco-innovations. This approach gives eco-innovations a social component, a status that is more than a new type of commodity, or a new sector, even though environmental technology and <b>eco-innovation</b> are associated with the emergence of new economic activities or even branches (e.g., waste treatment, recycling, etc.). This approach considers <b>eco-innovation</b> in terms of usage rather than merely in terms of product. The social pillar associated with <b>eco-innovation</b> introduces a governance component that makes <b>eco-innovation</b> a more integrated tool for sustainable development.|$|E
40|$|The {{environmental}} economics literature emphasises the key role that environmental regulations play in stimulating <b>eco-innovations.</b> Innovation literature, {{on the other}} hand, underlines other important determinants of <b>eco-innovations,</b> mainly the supply-side factors such as firms’ organisational capabilities and demand-side mechanisms, such as customer requirements and societal requirements on corporate social responsibility (CSR). This paper brings together the views of these different disciplines and provides empirical insights on the drivers of <b>eco-innovations</b> based on a novel dataset of 1566 UK firms that responded to the Government Survey of Environmental Protection Expenditure by Industry in 2006. By applying the Heckman selection model, our findings indicate that demand factors affect {{the decision of the}} firm to undertake <b>eco-innovations</b> whilst these factors exhibit no impact upon the level of investments in <b>eco-innovations.</b> Hence, we suggest that firms initiate <b>eco-innovations</b> in order to satisfy the minimum customer and societal requirements, yet, increased investments in <b>eco-innovations</b> are stimulated by other factors such as cost savings, firms’ organisational capabilities, and stricter regulations. Based on a quantile regression analysis, the paper offers interesting insights for policy makers, by showing that the stringency of environmental regulations affects <b>eco-innovations</b> of the less innovative firms differently from those of the more innovative firms...|$|R
40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{the role of}} <b>eco-innovations</b> in sustainable development. The {{first part of the}} paper pertains to the essence and meaning of sustainable development, with a particular attention paid to the technical dimen-sion. Then a qualitative model of <b>eco-innovations,</b> which are the main factor of green growth, is introduced. The last part of the article contains the analysis of the results of CIS 2008 survey in relation to the propensity and motivations to introduce the <b>eco-innovations,</b> as well as the benefits from the introduction of the <b>eco-innovations</b> in enterprises from EU countries...|$|R
5000|$|Literature in {{the field}} of <b>eco-innovations</b> often focuses on policy, regulations, technology, market and firm {{specific}} factors rather than diffusion. However, understanding of diffusion of <b>eco-innovations</b> recently has gained more importance given the fact that some <b>eco-innovations</b> are already at a mature stage. Survey research shows that most customers hold positive attitudes towards various types of <b>eco-innovations.</b> At the same time, adoption rates of solutions such as dynamic electricity tariffs remain unsatisfactorily low. The [...] "Not In My Back Yard" [...] (NIMBY) concept is often used to describe what at first seems to be a confusing intention-behavior gap between high levels of public support for <b>eco-innovations</b> and frequent non-engagement or even local hostility towards specific project proposals. Social psychology and economic behavior models could and should be used to overcome these challenges.|$|R

40|$|Financial {{constraints}} have {{an important}} impact {{on the development of}} <b>eco-innovations,</b> but their effect varies according to the type of funds taken into account. This article studies the impact of the lack of funds on the development of <b>eco-innovations,</b> distinguishing between internal, external and public funds. In particular, we investigate the interaction between public funding, on the one hand, and internal and other external sources of funding. The empirical analysis is based upon a sample of European SMEs belonging to different sectors that are involved in products, processes and organizational <b>eco-innovations.</b> Our results show that a lack of internal funding always decreases the probability to introduce <b>eco-innovations,</b> while the lack of private external funds does not appear to hinder the development of <b>eco-innovations.</b> Interestingly, we find that access to public funds or incentives is effective in improving a firm's ability to introduce <b>eco-innovations,</b> but only when the firm is not short of funds (either from internal or external sources), thus suggesting that public funds are somewhat complementary to other funds. Further analysis shows that these effects are mostly relevant in small firms...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the {{importance}} of the management of <b>eco-innovations</b> has been growing, more in practice than in academia. However, although in the literature there are already some evidences focussed on management of <b>eco-innovations,</b> there is no comprehensive review on the knowledge base of diffusion of <b>eco-innovations.</b> This paper provides a current overview of the existing body of literature, identifying the most active scholars and relevant publications in this field, and deepening in the major disciplines and research streams. Results show that the theory of diffusion of innovations which provided the philosophical underpinnings of how innovations are diffused is not the main knowledge base to explain the diffusion of <b>eco-innovations.</b> Lead market hypothesis, sustainable transitions and the ecological modernization appear as the initial base of the cognitive platform that can contribute to the understanding of diffusion of <b>eco-innovations...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{theoretical}} and empirical innovation literature {{stresses the importance of}} regional fac-tors and locational conditions for location choice of firms and their innovation success. Innovation activities are not equally distributed in space because agglomeration effects and specific regional infrastructures may promote innovation success. Concerning environmentally oriented innovations, the so-called <b>eco-innovations,</b> there is a widespread empirical literature analyzing their determinants but - {{because of the lack of}} adequate data - the inclusion of regional and locational factors has been neglected. This paper tries to close this gap by using the establishment panel of the German Institute for Employment Research in Nuremberg combined with data at the regional level. To explore specific regional determinants of <b>eco-innovations</b> compared to other innovations including variables at the firm and the regional level, a two-level mixed effects logistic regression has been applied. Our econometric results show that external knowledge sources such as the regional proximity to research centers and universities are more important for <b>eco-innovations</b> compared to other innovations. <b>Eco-innovations</b> seem to be a chance for under-developed, disadvantaged regions because especially regions characterized by a high unemployment rate are more likely to adopt <b>eco-innovations.</b> Furthermore, <b>eco-innovations</b> need more effort concerning R&D inputs, further education measures within a firm and the qualifi-cation of the personnel...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Eco-innovation</b> {{is closely}} linked {{to a variety of}} related concepts. It is often used interchangeably with [...] "{{environmental}} innovation", and is also often linked with environmental technology, eco-efficiency, eco-design, environmental design, sustainable design, or sustainable innovation. While the term [...] "environmental innovation" [...] is used in similar contexts to [...] "eco-innovation", the other terms are mostly used when referring to product or process design, and therefore focus more on the technological aspects of <b>eco-innovation</b> rather than the societal or political aspects. Ecovation is the process by which responsible capitalism aligns with ecological innovation to construct products which have a generative nature and are recyclable back into the environment for usage in other industries.|$|E
30|$|The {{purpose of}} this case study was to {{contribute}} to the body of knowledge on the assessment of <b>eco-innovations</b> by carrying out an experimental case study in the agricultural plantations industry. Innovations mainly aimed at enhancing economic gains can have accidental impact on the environment. However the assessment of the impact of these <b>eco-innovations</b> is the challenge. Since due to the underdeveloped theoretical and methodological approaches to analyze these benefits (Rennings 2000; Peiris and Gunarathne, 2015), the study used the triple bottom line approach. In doing so physical and monetary sustainability information was used (Burritt et al. 2002, International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) 2005) to quantify these impacts. Yet there are many potential impacts that were not captured in the present paper. It is only when these impacts are considered that the full benefit of <b>eco-innovations</b> can be evaluated. This case study reveals the difficulty in having a standardized set of indicators to measure the impact of <b>eco-innovations</b> owing to the multidimensionality of sustainability. Further, this case study emphasizes that the problems associated with measuring sustainability are common to the assessment of <b>eco-innovations</b> as well. Hence {{there is a need for}} further development of sustainability indicators to make inter and intra industry comparisons of the <b>eco-innovations</b> meaningful. The way forward would be to adopt broad sustainability indicators that represent the wholeness of the system while capturing the long term impacts.|$|R

Accordingly, they tend to emerge from cooperation between different entities, {{in addition to the}} constitution of partnerships among public sector, academia and private sector (Carrillo-Hermosilla et al. 2010).|$|R

Its final purpose is to {{contribute to the development of}} sustainable and ecological ways of production and consumption. In this process, consumers’ environmental expectations are met; firms increase their created and captured value and enhance their sustainability, and governments and institutions foster cleaner production and consumption.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} {{presented}} in this article is to assess, from an environmental standpoint, a set of <b>eco-innovations</b> applied to the production process of an automotive component. The <b>eco-innovations</b> were developed by a supply network of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the framework of a project named “Hi-reach”. The component considered is a motorcycle rear wheel spindle. The conventional version is obtained by machining a single forged steel part. The Hi-reach version is indeed manufactured by joining a shaft to a flange; in addition, conventional surface treatments are replaced by a plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) treatment and other machining steps are improved. This process was conceived with the aim of maintaining (or enhancing) the technical performance of the spindle and reducing production costs. A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was carried out to compare the two scenarios described. Those <b>eco-innovations</b> resulted in significant improvements of the environmental performance of the analysed component, ranging, on average, between 50 % and 70 % for the impact indicators considered.

30|$|Our {{case study}} further {{highlights}} {{the difficulties in}} carrying out a priori cost-benefit analysis {{in terms of an}} investment appraisal (Drury 2009; Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 1995) since <b>eco-innovations</b> would involve capital expenditure. This difficulty could arise owing to several reasons. One reason is the difficulty in monetizing some of the environmental and social impact. As explained in the previous paragraph, another issue lies with the selection of the suitable indicators and the time period. These issues converge to highlight the typical problems associated with capital budgeting (refer Rossi 2014; Drury 2009; Brounen et al. 2004). Another interesting issue that makes a priori cost benefit analysis difficult is the nature of <b>eco-innovations.</b> As most <b>eco-innovations</b> are unintentional (Carrillo-Hermosilla et al. 2010; Horbach et al. 2012; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 2009) an entity would only realize its potential once the innovation is carried out. Hence what is possible is post-completion sustainability investment appraisal only. According to Burritt et al.’s (2002) comprehensive framework, this leads a company to apply ex-post investment assessments which should be done both in physical and monetary terms.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we adopt {{a recent}} OECD {{framework}} {{and examine the}} role of external policy tools and internal firm specific factors for stimulating three different types of <b>eco-innovations</b> that range on a spectrum of lower to higher technological and environmental impacts: End-of-Pipeline Pollution Control Technologies, Integrated Cleaner Production Technologies and Environmental R&D. Using a novel firm-level dataset from a DEFRA survey, we estimate a Tobit model, which provides empirical evidence showing that these <b>eco-innovations</b> are motivated by different external policy tools and internal firm specific factors. Our findings indicate that End of Pipeline Technologies and Integrated Cleaner Production Technologies are mainly driven by equipment upgrade motives {{with a view of}} improving efficiency while environmental regulations are effective in stimulating the End-of-Pipeline technologies and Environmental R&D. Interestingly, alongside government induced regulations, we find that market factors, mainly motivated by cost savings, are effective in driving Environmental R&D. Finally, ISO 14001 certification is effective in strengthening the positive impact of environmental management systems on both End-of-Pipeline technologies and Environmental R&D while CSR policies have no significant impact on motivating any of the <b>eco-innovations...</b>|$|R

30|$|Problems {{associated}} with measuring sustainable development (Hamilton and Atkinson 2006; Boggia and Cortina 2010), corporate sustainability performance (Escrig-Olmedo et al. 2017), and developing suitable indicators (Krajnc and Glavič 2003) {{are common to}} the assessment of <b>eco-innovations.</b> Hence this case study, while highlighting the difficulties in measuring impact of <b>eco-innovations,</b> emphasizes {{the need for the}} further development of sustainability indicators. Without proper assessment it is difficult to gauge how far the intended outcomes have been reached. As Krajnc and Glavič (2003) suggest “…to cope with the complexity of sustainability-related issues for different systems, the indicators have to reflect the wholeness of the system as well as the interaction of its subsystems (p. 281)”. We used only simple and easy–to-implement indicators, but when a company advances it is necessary to move towards more complex indicators (Escrig-Olmedo et al. 2017; Krajnc and Glavič 2003). Perhaps, the way forward can be the development of fuzzy multi-criterion decision-making (MCDM) methods (Escrig-Olmedo et al. 2017; Boggia and Cortina 2010; Krajnc and Glavič 2003) {{to assess the impact of}} <b>eco-innovations.</b> On the other hand, most of the impact of <b>eco-innovations</b> are long term, particularly in the plantation agriculture industry. Therefore, in addition to the selection of a set of indicators there is the challenge to determine the suitable time frame for the assessment. This highlights the challenges faced in the development of indicators considering the main dimensions of sustainability indicators, i.e. unit of measurement, type of measurement, tracking period and measurement boundary (Krajnc and Glavič 2003).|$|R
