The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether there is a relationship between the presence of plasma cells and other cells, and immunoglobulin levels in BAL fluid of patients with <b>extrinsic</b> <b>allergic</b> <b>alveolitis.</b> METHODS [...] Thirty non-smoking patients with <b>extrinsic</b> <b>allergic</b> <b>alveolitis</b> who had a bronchoalveolar lavage 2 - 7 days after their last exposure to the causative antigen were selected, retrospectively. RESULTS [...] Patients suffering from <b>extrinsic</b> <b>allergic</b> <b>alveolitis</b> with plasma cells in the BAL fluid (n = 18) had increased absolute numbers of lymphocytes, eosinophils and mast cells, a decreased percentage of alveolar macrophages and lower CD 4 /CD 8 ratio, as well as higher immunoglobulin levels, when compared with patients with <b>extrinsic</b> <b>allergic</b> <b>alveolitis</b> having no plasma cells in the BAL fluid (n = 12). CONCLUSIONS [...] The results suggest a relationship between the presence of plasma cells and the other constituents in BAL fluid and a more intense alveolitis.

The question, concerning violations features of leukocytes phagocytic activity in blood and their role in pathogenesis of <b>allergic</b> <b>alveolitis</b> development against the adrenalin myocardial injury before and after application of the antioxidants has not been studied till now. Research objective was to find out changes of the leukocytes phagocytic activity in blood in dynamics of formation of the experimental <b>allergic</b> <b>alveolitis</b> and adrenalin myocardial injury, as well as to determine the influence of the tiotriazolini preparation on them. Experiments were carried out on 68 guinea pigs, which were divided into six groups. The first – control, the second, third, fourth and fifth groups – animals with the experimental <b>allergic</b> <b>alveolitis</b> and adrenalin myocardial injury respectively on the first, seventh, fourteenth and twenty fourth days of experiment. The sixth group – guinea pigs after application of the tiotriazolini, which was inserted intramuscularly once a day in a dose of 100 mg per 1 kg of weight within 10 days (from 14 to 24 days). The gradual increase of level of the phagocytic index and phagocytic number in blood of animals in the 1 st, 7 th, 14 th and 24 th days of experimental <b>allergic</b> <b>alveolitis</b> development in the conditions of adrenalin myocardial injury has been determined during experiment. Application of the tiotriazolini caused corrective action on the specified indicators downwards. Thus, the conducted researches of indicators of the phagocytic index and phagocytic number in blood made it possible to study features of changes and to define an important role of leukocytes phagocytic activity in pathogenesis of experimental <b>allergic</b> <b>alveolitis</b> and adrenalin myocardial injury, as well as the positive correcting action of tiotriazolini on the specified markers has been established.

In this study we investigated the immunoreactivity of two important superoxide radical scavenging intracellular antioxidant enzymes, manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and copperzinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), in pulmonary sarcoidosis and <b>extrinsic</b> <b>allergic</b> <b>alveolitis.</b> In histologically normal lung MnSOD was variable but mostly positive in the cells of bronchial epithelium, alveolar epithelium especially in type II pneumocytes, and alveolar macrophages. Copperzinc SOD showed positive immunoreactivity most markedly in the bronchial epithelium.

40|$|<b>Extrinsic</b> <b>allergic</b> <b>alveolitis</b> and {{pulmonary}} sarcoidosis are granulomatous {{diseases of}} the lung for which clinical presentation and anatomic site of granuloma formation differ. <b>Extrinsic</b> <b>allergic</b> <b>alveolitis</b> is caused by inhaled antigens, whereas the nature and source of the inciting antigen in sarcoidosis is unknown. To test {{the hypothesis that the}} route via which antigen is introduced to the lung contributes to the clinicopathological presentation of pulmonary granulomatous disease, rats immunized with intravenous (i. v.) Corynebacterium parvum were challenged after 2 weeks with either intratracheal (i. t.) or i. v. C. parvum. The granulomatous inflammation elicited by i. t. challenge predominantly involved alveolar spaces and histologically simulated <b>extrinsic</b> <b>allergic</b> <b>alveolitis.</b> In contrast, the inflammation induced by i. v. challenge was characterized by granulomatous angiitis and interstitial inflammation simulating sarcoidosis. Elevations of leukocyte counts and TNF levels in bronchoalveolar fluid, which reflect inflammation in the intra-alveolar compartment, were much more pronounced after i. t. than after i. v. challenge. Tumor necrosis factor, interleukin- 6, CC chemokine, CXC chemokine, and adhesion molecule mRNA and protein expression occurred in each model. In conclusion, i. t. or i. v. challenge with C. parvum in sensitized rats caused pulmonary granulomatous inflammation that was histologically similar to human <b>extrinsic</b> <b>allergic</b> <b>alveolitis</b> and sarcoidosis, respectively. Although the soluble and cellular mediators of granulomatous inflammation were qualitatively similar in both disease models, the differing anatomic source of the same antigenic challenge was responsible for differing clinicopathological presentations...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} whether occupational exposure to raw tobacco causes respiratory or allergic diseases, {{an excess of}} respiratory symptoms, a decrease in lung function, or parenchymal changes in chest radiography among Finnish cigar workers. METHODS: This cross sectional study included all Finnish cigar workers (n = 106) exposed to raw tobacco and also a group of unexposed matched referents. Data were collected with a self administered questionnaire, flow volume spirometry, measurements of diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, chest radiography and skin prick tests. A questionnaire was also sent to former workers of the factory. RESULTS: There {{were no significant differences}} between the groups in the prevalence of respiratory symptoms and chest radiography findings. Nine of 102 tobacco workers had pulmonary fibrosis of at least 1 / 0 (according to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) 1980 classification) and the corresponding figure was five for the referents. The tobacco workers tended to have a low forced vital capacity (FVC), and they had impaired forced expiratory volume in 1 second and lower means of the maximal expiratory flow at 25 % of the FVC significantly more often than the referents. Diffusing capacity tended to be lower among the referents. The referents more often had atopy and earlier atopic diseases than the exposed workers. These results indicate the possibility of selection among the exposed workers. CONCLUSIONS: No excess of prevalence of respiratory symptoms in the tobacco workers was found. According to the questionnaire episodes of <b>allergic</b> <b>alveolitis</b> may have occurred in the cigar factory workers. However, in the absence of impairments in lung function and radiological changes it was not possible to distinguish humidifier fever and <b>allergic</b> <b>alveolitis.</b> In exposure conditions that include humidification of the air humidifier, fever and <b>allergic</b> <b>alveolitis</b> constitute a risk for tobacco workers.

Б. Пандус Danylo Halytsky Lviv National Medical University, Lviv, Ukraine Львівський національний медичний університет ім. Данила Галицького, м. Львів, Україна Abstract Allergic diseases cover more than 20 % of people living on the earth, among who exogenous <b>allergic</b> <b>alveolitis</b> (AA) occupies a prominent place. However, the frequency of this disease increases and there is a number of complications with not only medical but also socio-economic values. Today the question remains to be not studied that concerns changes of selected indicators of clinical and humoral immunity in the blood for experimental allergic alveoli (EAA) and adrenaline myocardial injury (AMI) and the possibility of their correction with antioxidants. The goal of study was to elucidate peculiarities of changes of immunological reactivity in the EAA in terms of AMI and set the effect of thiotriazoline on them. The study of individual markers of cellular and humoral immunity showed a malfunction of the immune system in the formation of EAA and AMI and set monocristalline the effect of thiotriazolin on the level of T and B-lymphocytes and CIC in blood. Key words: experimental <b>allergic</b> <b>alveolitis,</b> adrenaline myocardial injury, thiotriazolin.
