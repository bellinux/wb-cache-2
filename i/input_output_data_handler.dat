40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{conventional}} Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is {{to evaluate the}} performance of a set of firms or Decision-Making Units using deterministic <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> <b>data.</b> However, the <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> <b>data</b> in the real-life performance evaluation problems are often stochastic. The stochastic <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> <b>data</b> in DEA can be represented with random variables. Several methods have been proposed to deal with the random <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> <b>data</b> in DEA. In this paper, we propose a new chance-constrained DEA model with birandom <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> <b>data.</b> A super-efficiency model with birandom constraints is formulated and a non-linear deterministic equivalent model is obtained to solve the super-efficiency model. The non-linear model is converted into a model with quadratic constraints to solve the non-linear deterministic model. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the robustness of the proposed super-efficiency model. Finally, two numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed chance-constrained DEA model and sensitivity analysis...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{classical}} cost efficiency (CE) models to include data uncertainty. We {{believe that many}} research situations are best described by the intermediate case, where some uncertain <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> <b>data</b> are available. In such cases, the classical cost efficiency models cannot be used, because <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> <b>data</b> appear {{in the form of}} ranges. When the data are imprecise in the form of ranges, the cost efficiency measure calculated from the data should be uncertain as well. So, in the current paper, we develop a method for the estimation of upper and lower bounds for the cost efficiency measure in situations of uncertain <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> <b>data.</b> Also, we develop the theory of efficiency measurement so as to accommodate incomplete price information by deriving upper and lower bounds for the cost efficiency measure. The practical application of these bounds is illustrated by a numerical example.

40|$|System Identification is {{the process}} of {{constructing}} a mathematical model from <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> <b>data</b> for a system under testing, and characterizing the system uncertainties and measurement noises. The mathematical model structure can take various forms depending upon the intended use. The SYSTEM/OBSERVER/CONTROLLER IDENTIFICATION TOOLBOX (SOCIT) is a collection of functions, written in MATLAB language and expressed in M-files, that implements a variety of modern system identification techniques.
