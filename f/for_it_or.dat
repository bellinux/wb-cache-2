5|$|A hub is able {{to support}} low {{bandwidth}} devices mixed with other speed device via a special PID value, PRE. This is required as a USB hub functions as a very simple repeater, broadcasting the host message to all connected devices regardless if the packet was <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> not.

Such larvae have soft bodies with no limbs, and have a blind gut (presumably so that they do not foul their cell).|$|E
5|$|Sifton's {{successor}} as Premier was Charles Stewart, the Minister of Public Works in his cabinet. Stewart, {{who supported}} conscription {{but did not}} actively campaign <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> the Unionists, kept Cross as Attorney-General, despite rumours that he would not. Cross's major challenge was enforcing prohibition, which was proving challenging. The Conservatives, and in particular George Douglas Stanley, were unreluctant to accuse Cross of mismanagement. In the meantime, a rift was opening between Cross and Stewart (whom the Conservatives accused, somewhat ironically, of being unduly influenced by his Attorney-General). Stewart found Cross neglectful of his duties, and after Cross refused to dismiss two detectives from his department whose work Stewart felt could be better done by the Alberta Provincial Police, Stewart requested his resignation. When twelve days passed without a reply from Cross, Stewart fired him August 26, 1918. His replacement as Attorney-General was Boyle, his nemesis of the Alberta and Great Waterways era.|$|E

25|$|Because {{the common}} skate is {{long-lived}} and slow to mature, {{it is difficult}} for it to repopulate quickly. Coupled with overfishing, this means that the common skate's population has drastically decreased and it is likely it will disappear entirely unless more is done to preserve it. It is strictly protected within the EU, making it illegal for commercial fishers to actively fish <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> keep it if accidentally landed.

25|$|Corruption, in {{this context}} the {{diversion}} of public finance from {{the needs of the}} army, may have contributed greatly to the Fall. The rich senatorial aristocrats in Rome itself became increasingly influential during the fifth century; they supported armed strength in theory, but did not wish to pay <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> to offer their own workers as army recruits. They did, however, pass large amounts of money to the Christian Church. At a local level, from the early fourth century, the town councils lost their property and their power, which often became concentrated {{in the hands of a}} few local despots beyond the reach of the law.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} {{separating}} {{church and state}} is often credited to the writings of English philosopher John Locke (1632–1704). According to his principle of the social contract, Locke argued that the government lacked authority {{in the realm of}} individual conscience, as this was something rational people could not cede to the government <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> others to control. For Locke, this created a natural right in the liberty of conscience, which he argued must therefore remain protected from any government authority. These views on religious tolerance and the importance of individual conscience, along with his social contract, became particularly influential in the American colonies and the drafting of the United States Constitution.|$|E
25|$|In May 1991, Horizon Air, a US-based airline, {{placed an}} order for 35 aircraft, this was the largest order for the 328 at that point and was larger than any other order <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> its {{competitors}} to be placed that year. In October 1991, the first prototype of the 328 was formally rolled out. On 6 December 1991, the first prototype conducted the type's maiden flight. On 4 June 1992, a second 328 prototype performed its first flight. On 14 December 1992, one of the 328 prototypes suffered a near-catastrophic in-flight propeller failure when all six propeller blades on one engine detached before puncturing the fuselage, the subsequent temporary loss of control caused the aircraft to roll 280 degrees and descend 5,000 feet before control was recovered.|$|E
25|$|At the time, the Schuylkill Valley was a {{hotly contested}} territory, with {{constant}} conflicts over titles, some dating to before the American Revolution and British colonial rule, and rights. Had {{any of their}} competitors became aware of what Tower and Munson were up to, they may well have bought up the land the pair were after, and charged exorbitant prices <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> <b>or</b> worse, refused to sell it at all. The partners operated secretly to protect their interests. Tower would make the purchases, and convey the titles to legal dummies to hide the ownership of the land. By 1858 Tower and Munson had acquired eleven thousand acres (45km2). By now, Munson and Tower's plan was well out of the bag, and anyone who had even a partial claim {{to any of the}} lands began to litigate. Only Tower's considerable skill as a lawyer kept the whole enterprise from falling apart.|$|E

25|$|When teams start a leg, {{arrive at}} Route Markers, or {{complete}} certain tasks, they normally receive a letter-sized tear-away envelope that contains their next clue inside a vertical-fold folder. The clues themselves are typically printed on a vertical strip of paper, although additional information is often provided inside the clue folder. After retrieving the clue, teams open {{the envelope and}} read aloud the instructions given on the clue sheet and then follow those instructions. Teams are generally required to collect each clue during each leg and keep that information with them until they reach the next Pit Stop, surrendering them once they have checked in. Teams may not take an additional clue from the clue box should they lose their first one, otherwise they are assessed a penalty. Teams are not directly penalized for misplacing their clue but will lose time either searching <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> trying to learn from other teams of where to go next.|$|E

500|$|The radio engineers' {{preoccupation with}} static and the {{techniques}} {{being used to}} reduce {{it led to the}} idea that noise could be totally eliminated by, in some way, compensating <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> canceling it out. The culmination of this viewpoint was expressed in a 1928 paper by Edwin Armstrong. This led to a famous retort by Carson in a subsequent paper, [...] "Noise, like the poor, will always be with us". [...] Armstrong was technically in the wrong in this exchange, but in 1933, ironically and paradoxically, went on to invent wide-band FM which enormously improved the noise performance of radio by increasing the bandwidth.|$|E

500|$|Wheeler's delayed choice {{experiment}} is actually several thought experiments in quantum physics that he proposed, {{with the most}} prominent among them appearing in 1978 and 1984.

Danja, a protégé of Timbaland, stated: [...] "We had no direction at all other than 'Cry Me a River,' and not in the sense of mimicking the track, but in how big the song was. There was no direction for how he wanted the song to sound, because there was no direction for how he wanted [...] to sound." ...|$|E
500|$|Monteverdi {{retained}} {{emotional and}} political attachments to the Mantuan court and wrote <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> <b>or</b> undertook to write, {{large amounts of}} stage music including at least four operas. The ballet Tirsi e Clori survives through its inclusion in the seventh book, {{but the rest of}} the Mantuan dramatic music is lost. Many of the missing manuscripts may have disappeared in the wars that overcame Mantua in 1630. The most significant aspect of their loss, according to Carter, is the extent to which they might have provided musical links between Monteverdi's early Mantuan operas and those he wrote in Venice after 1638: [...] "Without these links... it is hard to a produce a coherent account of his development as a composer for the stage". Likewise, Janet Beat regrets that the 30-year gap hampers the study of how opera orchestration developed during those critical early years.|$|E
