40|$|Abstract — An {{autonomous}} wall <b>inspection</b> <b>control</b> {{based on}} a stereo optical flow, suitable for unmanned aerial vehicles endowed with a stereo vision system, is proposed in this paper. The inspection task consists of simultaneously controlling the inspection velocity along the surface, the relative yaw angle between the vehicle and the observed plane, {{as well as the}} orthogonal distance. A virtual spherical camera is considered at the center of gravity of the vehicle. Then, a stereo optical flow, {{as if it had been}} acquired by the virtual camera, is generated from the visual data provided by the stereo vision system. The 3 D visual measurements are also employed to estimate the relative position and orientation of the observed plane. Hence, the absolute vehicle velocity is estimated by using a robust translational average optical flow by integrating the total stereo flow. Finally, an <b>inspection</b> <b>control</b> and a hovering control are proposed. The effectiveness of the described approach has been demonstrated with a dynamic simulation in an environment composed of two adjacent walls. I...|$|E

Inspection task was performed by using computer. Subjects were 10 undergraduate randomly selected and test for 20 / 20. Then, subjects {{were divided into two}} groups, five for regular <b>inspection</b> (<b>control</b> group) and five for complex inspection (treatment group) tasks. Result was showed that performance on regular and complex inspectors was significantly difference at the level of 0. 05. Inspector performance on regular inspection was showed high percentage on defects detected by using equal time to complex inspection. This would be indicated that inspector performance was affected by visual inspection task. Keywords—Visual inspection task, Regular and complex task. A I...|$|E

The Aw values weren’t influenced by addition of water, as it showed by two water added samples (with 3 % and 6 %). The pH values were the same of low acid meat product (pH about 6). The redox potential was negative because of oxygen reduction and presence of reducing ingredients and additives.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, we {{introduce}} {{a mathematical model}} for estimating the use of defect inspection capacity. Until recently, the selection of lots to be inspected was only done {{at the beginning of}} the manufacturing process. With the introduction of dynamic controls on production tools, the selection of lots to be inspected is done according to the production state. Our problem focuses on the Wafer at Risk (W@R) on process tools. The W@R is the number of processed wafers between two control operations. The W@R depends on several factors such as the availability of measurable products, control limits, defect inspection capacity and defect <b>inspection</b> <b>control</b> plans of products. Our model aims at calculating the defect inspection capacity required for given values of the listed factors. Experimental results on actual factory data are presented and discussed...|$|E

40|$|The statechart {{formalism}} {{allows for}} the specification of behavior models of complex, reactive systems. It is employed in the embedded systems domain to specify and verify applications at design time. By enabling the interpretation of formalised behaviour models one earns the favourable abilities of application behaviour <b>inspection,</b> <b>control,</b> and substitution at runtime. One of the major arguments against such an approach concerns poor interpretation performance and high-resource overhead. We are answering this argument by showing that it is feasible to implement a statechart interpreter on a resource-limited platform. We define the utilised statechart formalism {{and use it as}} a base for implementing a resource-efficient interpreter on a 8 bit microcontroller with 2 kByte RAM. Performance overhead of key aspects of the interpretation engine is evaluated using suitable behaviour models and by comparison with compiled cod...|$|E

40|$|Control {{limits in}} use at {{metrology}} stations are traditionally set by yield requirements. Since excursions from these limits usually trigger machine stoppage, the monitor design {{has a direct}} impact on the station's availability, and thus on the product cycle time (CT). In this work we lay the foundation for a bi-criteria trade-off formulation between expected CT and die yield based on the impact of the <b>inspection</b> <b>control</b> limits on both performance measures. We assume a single machine plagued by a particle deposition process and immediately followed by a monitor step. We explore the impact of the upper control limit on the expected final yield on one hand, and on the distribution of the station time between consecutive stoppages on the other. The obtained model enables decision makers to knowingly sacrifice yield to shorten CT and vice versa. ...|$|E
