40|$|Abstract. <b>Hydrostatic</b> <b>Curves</b> {{is widely}} used to {{calculate}} vessel’s displacement by ship’s officers and surveyors. However, under some specific circumstances such as light ballast arrival condition, {{it is difficult to}} obtain an accurate figure of displacement by using <b>Hydrostatic</b> <b>curves.</b> At this time, Bonjean curves as an alternative can be employed in calculating vessel’s displacement. The procedures are introduced step by step to calculate the vessel’s displacement by Bonjean’s curves. The differences of calculation by two means are demonstrated on a specific bulk carrier and therewith the reasons are analyzed. Finally, the article appeals the detailed Bonjean curves shall be provided on board by shipyard for improving the accuracy of calculation...|$|E

Consequently detailed knowledge of this material, especially while under shock loading, is extremely useful {{for the design of}} components that could be subjected to impact during their lifespan. The shock Hugoniot equation of state for phenolic resin (Durite SC- 1008), with initial density of 1. 18 gcm − 3 have been determined using the plate-impact technique with in situ manganin stress gauges. The Hugoniot equation in the shock velocity-particle velocity plane was found to be non- linear in nature with the following equation: Us = 2. 14 + 3. 79 up - 1. 68 up 2. Further, the Hugoniot in the pressure-volume plane was observed to largely follow the <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>curve.</b> Lateral gauge measurements were also obtained. An ANSYS Autodyn TM 2 D model was used to investigate the lateral stress behaviour of the SC- 1008. A comparison of the Hugoniot elastic limit calculated from the shear strength and measured sound speeds gave reasonable agreement with a value of 0. 66 ± 0. 35 GPa obtai...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{suggests}} using a formwork {{system based}} on cement bonded particle boards (CBPB) filled with coarse pore expanded clay concrete {{in order to improve}} the technical efficiency of the building envelope. Such a structure is made of lightweight or honeycomb concrete units, has a thickness equal to that of heavyweight concrete blocks and provides increased resistance to heat, better fire resistance and longer durability. The relatively modest price of the suggested option is seen as a notable advantage. The effects of coarse pore expanded clay concrete have been shown as being similar to the effects of heavyweight concrete, with the nature of the effects demonstrated on a <b>hydrostatic</b> pressure <b>curve.</b> The author has substantiated the geometric parameters for the suggested heat-efficient envelope design: a 800 × 800 × 370 mm block of CBPB filled with coarse-pore expanded clay concrete γ= 500 kg/m 3...|$|R

This will structure features or steps to be followed to perform and have a good design. Like any other procedure, we have a beginning and an end. The beginning of the design of a naval structure will start from the requirements of the vessel, like its geometry, structure, propulsive system, etc. As the end, to obtain the physical structure and the objective that has been proposed for that vessel.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{constitutive}} modelling of contiguous rock located between rock joints. A fully explicit kinematically constrained microplane-type constitutive model for hardening and softening non-linear triaxial behaviour of isotropic porous rock is developed. The microplane framework, {{in which the}} constitutive relation is {{expressed in terms of}} stress and strain vectors rather than tensors, makes it possible to model various microstructural physical mechanisms associated with oriented internal surfaces, such as cracking, slip, friction and splitting of a particular orientation. Formulation of the constitutive relation is facilitated {{by the fact that it}} is decoupled from the tensorial invariance restrictions, which are satisfied automatically. In its basic features, the present model is similar to the recently developed microplane model M 4 for concrete, but there are significant improvements and modifications. They include a realistic simulation of (1) the effects of pore collapse on the volume changes during triaxial loading and on the reduction of frictional strength, (2) recovery of frictional strength during shearing, and (3) the shear-enhanced compaction in triaxial tests, manifested by a deviation from the <b>hydrostatic</b> stress–strain <b>curve.</b> The model is calibrated by optimal fitting of extensive triaxial test data for Salem limestone, and good fits are demonstrated. Although these data do not cover the entire range of behaviour, credence in broad capabilities of the model is lend by its similarity to model M 4 for concrete}an artificial rock. The model is intended for large explicit finite-element programs. Copyright # 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

40|$|Porosity {{reduction}} during mechanical compaction of a sediment {{generally has}} been {{assumed to be}} controlled by the increase in vertical effective stress, which is convenient because vertical stress profiles may be readily calculated from density logs. Poroelasticity theory shows, however, that mean effective stress controls porosity reduction. According to published data, horizontal stresses increase with overpressure, as well as with depth, so mean stress and vertical stress profiles are poorly correlated in overpressured sections. We have used wireline logs to compare the pore pressures estimated in mudrocks by relating porosity to mean effective stress and to vertical effective stress for overpressured Tertiary sections in southeast Asia. Wells from three different basins were studied. Mudrock porosities were estimated from the sonic log response and sorted by lithology according to the natural gamma-log response. Two sets of normal compaction curves, relating porosity to mean effective stress and to vertical effective stress, were determined empirically by fitting data points where the pore pressure was thought to be <b>hydrostatic.</b> These <b>curves</b> were then used to estimate the minimum pore pressure corresponding to mudrock porosity values in the overpressured sections. The pore pressures inferred using the mean effective stress are consistent with direct measurements of pore pressure in the adjacent sands. In contrast, pore pressures inferred in mudrocks using the vertical effective stress are significantly lower for the overpressured sections, implying discontinuities in the pore pressure profiles at lithological boundaries, which cannot readily be explained. We conclude that the pore pressures estimated using the vertical effective stress are wrong and that empirical relationships between porosity and vertical effective stress should not be used for estimating pore pressures: porosity should be empirically related to mean effective stress instead. ...|$|R
40|$|The microplane {{material}} {{model for}} concrete, formulated mathematically {{in the preceding}} Part I, is here calibrated by material test data from all the typical laboratory tests taken from the literature. Then the model is verified by finite elements simulations of data for some characteristic tests with highly nonuniform strain fields. The scaling properties of model M 7 are determined. With the volumetric stress effect taken from the previous load step, the M 7 numerical algorithm is explicit, delivering in each load step the stress tensor from the strain tensor, with no iterative loop. This makes the model robust and suitable for large-scale finite element computations. There are 5 free, easily adjustable material parameters, which {{make it possible to}} match the given compressive strength, the corresponding strain, the given <b>hydrostatic</b> compression <b>curve,</b> and certain triaxial aspects. Besides, there are many fixed, hard-to-adjust, parameters, which can be taken the same for all concretes. The optimum values of material parameters are determined by fitting a particularly broad range of test results, including the important tests of compression-tension load cycles, mixed-mode fracture, tension-shear failure of double-edge-notched specimens, and vertex effect when axial compression is followed by torsion. Because of the lack of information on the material characteristic length or fracture energy, which can be obtained only by size effect tests on the same concrete, and on the precise boundary conditions and precise gauge locations, the finite element fitting of the present test data can hardly be expected to give better results than single-point simulations of specimens with approximately homogeneous strain states within the gauge length. Nevertheless, tensile test data with severe localization are delocalized on the basis of assumed material length. Model M 7 is shown to fit a considerably broader range of test data than the preceding models M 1 –M 6. Postprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of the LBR- 5 ‘‘Stiffened Panels Software’ ’ {{is included in the}} {{development of}} a new design methodology to ease and to improve preliminary studies of naval structures and floating hydraulic structures. The ultimate target is to link standard design tools (steel structure CAD, hull form, <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>curves,</b> floating stability, weight estimation, etc.) with a rational optimization design module and a minimum construction cost (or minimum weight) objective function. This paper is the first part of a series of two articles. It focuses on the ‘Module-Oriented Optimization ’ methodology and on the rational constraints. The second paper presents the optimization technique using convex linearization and a dual approach, and the optimization of an FSO unit as an example (Rigo and Fleury, Marine Stuructures, 2001). LBR- 5 allows, as of the first draft, an optimization of the scantling of the structure’s constituent elements. Relevant limit states of the structure are taken into account thanks to a 3 D rational analysis of the structure based on the general rules of solid-mechanics and structure behaviour. The optimization module is composed of 3 basic modules (OPTI, CONSTRAINT and COST) and a group of sub-modules (in external databases). Among these the user selects a set of relevant sub-modules (i. e. geometrical and structural constraints). Since the present optimization deals with least construction costs (as objective function), and uses an explicit objective function (not empirical), the user must specify labor costs (unitary materia...|$|E

Assim este aparato será projetado para ser simulado no Tanque do Laboratório de Arquitetura Naval, para podermos ter condições que ajudem a estudar os diversos modos de {{calcular}} forças e momentos de um navio soçobrado. Esta dissertação divide-se em duas partes, uma teórica e outra prática. Numa primeira parte, na seção do enquadramento teórico, foram abordados conceitos que serviram de base, para o estudo do comportamento da plataforma durante o processo de alagamento, com base em princípios da Arquitetura Naval, nomeadamente da Estabilidade. Com isto, foram realizados cálculos em Excel por forma a conseguir obter os gráficos de carenas direitas e inclinadas. Depois de ter obtido o gráfico de carenas inclinadas, foi mais acessível chegar ao cálculo dos momentos. Com esta base, a parte teórica fica concluída restando apenas a parte prática que irá ser comparada com esta e de seguida conseguiremos tirar algumas conclusões da viabilidade do aparato. Para realizarmos a parte prática, foi necessário fazer algumas alterações ao batelão, como poderemos ver nos capítulos seguintes. Com a ajuda da oficina da EN e da SA, foi possível contruir o aparato. Após construído o aparato, calcular-se-á os respetivos momentos e forças necessários para fazer com que o navio retome a sua posição inicial, tendo em conta as caraterísticas do tanque e adotando determinados pressupostos. Depois de efetuadas a provas no tanque e calibrado os componentes conclui que o sistema funcionava como pretendido inicialmente, pois devido aos pressupostos assumidos, o erro que resultou até foi relativamente baixo como irei demonstrar ao longo da dissertação. The aim of {{the present}} dissertation {{is to develop a}} device which allows to measure accurately the forces and moments of shipwrecked vessels. Thus, this device will be designed to be simulated in the tank of the Naval Architecture Laboratory so that there will be the right conditions to help us study the different ways to calculate the forces and moments of shipwrecked vessels. For it is the only place in EN which has conditions that could help in studying the calculations of forces and moments of a capsized ship. This dissertation is divided in two parts- a theoretical and a practical one. In the first part, the theoretical framework section, there’s an approach to the concepts that were the support {{for the study of the}} performance of the platform during the overflowing process, taking into account the principles of Naval Architecture, namely the principle of stability. With these fundamentals, calculations were performed in Excel have been done in order to obtain graphs of cross curves and <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>curves.</b> After having obtained the cross curves graphic it was easier to calculate the moments. On this basis, the theoretical part is concluded. The practical part will be compared with the theoretical one in order to draw some conclusions on the viability of the device. To accomplish the practical part, it was necessary to make some changes to the barge, as it can be seen in the following chapters. With the help of the EN and SA workshop, it was possible to build the. After having developed this part of the project, the moments and forces necessary to put the vessel in its initial position will be calculated taking into account the characteristics of the tank and adopting certain assumptions. After the tests performed in the tank and calibrated components concludes that the system worked as intended originally, because due to the assumptions made, the error that resulted was relatively low even as I will demonstrate throughout the dissertation...|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringTransient flow {{modelling}} {{is actively}} used to understand dynamic flow scenarios. In this thesis a modification and improvement has been performed for a transient flow model called AUSMV (Advective upstream splitting method). To get a understanding behind {{some of the}} simulation scenarios, a brief literary study has been performed on the dual gradient drilling concept and the dynamics behind underbalanced drilling The dual gradient drilling concept is built on the manipulation of pressure using two different fluid densities. The <b>hydrostatic</b> pressure <b>curve</b> produced using dual gradient {{makes it easier to}} handle low margins between pore and fracture pressure. Drilling can be performed faster, cheaper and give better completion solutions. The downside with the dual gradient concept is the need for rig modification, re-training of personnel and new well control procedures. The AUSMV scheme can be used to solve the transient drift flux model. This transient drift flux model uses a set of conservations and closure laws. The conservations of liquid and gas mass and the conservation of momentum. To close the system, four closure laws are added. Two of these closure laws are for the liquid and gas densities. These two closure laws were changed with new models which incorporate temperature effects. An existing Matlab code of the AUSMV scheme was used as basis for the modifications and simulations. Two different drilling cases were simulated. The first one was a underbalanced drilling scenario with three different configurations. The main purpose of this simulation was to include and test the temperature dependent density and viscosity models for liquid and gas. The simulation results were compared against results produced from the original code. First the density models were implemented and tested. Then the viscosity was modified to include temperature. Simulation showed that the largest effect of including temperature, was related to the density models and their impact on the hydrostatic pressure which was reduced. The second simulation was a controlled mudcap drilling scenario. The objective for this simulation was to control the mud level using a suction pump. A suction pump removed mud {{from the middle of the}} well during simulation and the hydrostatic column dropped along with the bottom hole pressure. A steady state was reached when the injection rate of mass was equal to the suction rate. By adjusting the mass rates, the mud column could be adjusted and the hydrostatic bottom hole pressure controlled. Several modification had to be done to the model in order to make this simulation possible. First a sink term had to be implemented in the liquid mass conservation equation. In addition, the floating mud level in the well causes challenges for the outlet boundary condition treatment and several approaches for handling this was investigated. Finally the effect of numerical diffusion on the mud level interface was demonstrated and by refining the grid, a more accurate description of the mud interface was obtained. However this type of refinement had a computational time cost...|$|R
40|$|The {{action of}} first-year ice ridges on {{offshore}} structures was studied using model basin tests, small-scale laboratory investigations and finite element modelling (FEM). Scalemodel experiments were performed at Hamburgische Schiffbau-Versuchsanstalt (Hamburg Ship Model Basin HSVA) in Germany. Seabed structures were impacted by modelled first-year ice ridges. Ice ridge keel geometry, ice thickness and driftspeed were all modelled at 1 : 20 scale, corresponding to a full-scale ridge with a keel 10 m deep. Four ice ridges were built with keel depths between 0. 45 and 0. 55 m. The main test variables were {{the temperature and}} rubble submersion time (5 h with Tair = - 0. 5 °C and 18 h with Tair = 4 °C) and the interaction speed (0. 045 and 0. 22 m/s). The structures included two underwater cubes with 0. 7 m side lengths and one cone with a 60 ° slope and a waterline diameter of 0. 6 m. Additional tests were performed to characterise the mechanical properties of the model ice keels, including punch tests, retaining wall tests, oedometer tests and piling tests. Small-scale laboratory work was performed in the cold laboratory at NTNU to investigate freeze-bond effects on the resistance of first-year ice ridges and their deformation process. The rubble was composed of saline ice blocks at - 7 °C, and freeze-bonds of three different strengths were created between the blocks by submerging them for 0 min, 10 min or 20 h. Fourteen shear box tests with three different vertical confinements were analysed. The punch tests and interaction tests were modelled in three dimensions using Abaqus V 8. 2 with the nonlinear Eulerian finite element method. The rubble's behaviour was described with the Drucker-Prager material model. The following points were highlighted {{in the analysis of}} the experiments: • The horizontal loads on the subsea structures reached a steady state of progressive local failure correlated with the keel profiles. • The time series from the retaining wall tests showed that the plate load was correlated with the penetration speed, and a wedge extrusion was observed. • The oedometer test showed behaviour typical of a loose soil. The Young modulus was measured at 0. 9 MPa, and the <b>hydrostatic</b> compressive yield <b>curve</b> was determined. • The finite element analysis of the punch tests showed that: A cohesive softening occurred in the rubble. It was assumed that the cohesion decreased linearly from its initial (peak) value to 0 over the first 2 % of plastic strain. For the short-submersion-time ridges, it was necessary to use a vertical distribution of the cohesion representing the vertical distribution of the freeze-bond strength. The cohesion was distributed linearly in the keel, from 0 Pa to 1. 2 kPa at the keel top. In the long-submersion-time tests, the cohesion was uniformly distributed in the keel and its value did not exceed 0. 5 kPa. The ice density and the keel depth were the main parameters governing the frictional resistance of the keel. Because of the low confinement at the rubble failure planes, the importance of the friction angle was reduced; therefore, this test is not the most appropriate for determining this angle. • In the pile tests, the critical angle was higher than the repose angle, indicating that cohesion can develop {{in a short period of}} time (less than 5 min). The friction angle was estimated to be between 30 º and 45 °. • The shear box experiments at NTNU showed that rubble failure was initiated by the breaking of freeze-bonds. The analyses revealed that increased freeze-bond strength contributed to: o Higher rubble shear resistance in the primary failure mode. o Higher strain localisation and dilatation under low confinement deformations. Finite element simulations of the model ice ridge keel interactions with the structures were performed using the material model and mechanical parameters determined from mechanical tests: • The numerical models were able to estimate the keel load and its deformed shape. • A progressive failure of the keel occurred, which agreed with observations reported from small- and medium-scale physical tests. The action of the model ice ridge keels on the cone was computed by analytical and numerical methods. The analytical method involved keel load calculations using the recommendations given in ISO/FDIS 19906 with minor modifications to account for the geometry of the structure. The following conclusions were drawn: • ISO recommendations are insufficient and potentially underconservative with respect to the calculation of loads from wide ridge keels on simple conical structures (at model scale). • It is necessary to consider the surcharge due to rubble accumulation. • Numerical methods can be used to better understand the behaviour of unconsolidated ridge keels and to calibrate analytical models.
