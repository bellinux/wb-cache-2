40|$|Results of a 12 month {{study of}} {{traditional}} guinea-pig {{production in the}} western highlands of Cameroon are reported. The mean age of <b>guinea-pigs</b> (<b>Cavia</b> <b>porcellus</b> L.) at ¢rst parturition, kidding interval and litter size at birth were 126. 30 + 10. 40 d, 64. 8 + 1. 70 d and 1. 63 + 0. 26 kids respectively. The annual reproductive rate was 9. 18 kids/breeding doe while the doe post-partum weight was 530 g. Mean body weights at birth, presumed weaning (21 d) and 15 weeks of age were 78. 36 + 3. 20, 147. 51 + 8. 10 and 418. 88 + 32 g respectively. Type of birth and sex had a signi¢cant e¡ect on body weight at all ages. Birth weight dropped signi¢cantly from 83. 88 + 2. 87 g for singles to 81. 57 + 3. 40 g for twins, 74. 25 + 2. 39 g for triplets and 73. 75 + 4. 12 g for quadruplets. These di¡erences were maintained to maturity (15 weeks). Males were generally heavier than females. Mortality rates were relatively high among kids: 24 % at birth, 39 % at 3 weeks and 40 % at 15 weeks. Productivity indices were 0. 827 kg of young weaned per doe per year, 1560 g of young weaned per kg of doe per year and 2. 52 kg of young weaned per kg metabolic weight (kg 0. 75) of female per year...|$|E

The potentialisation of activity between griseofulvin and the essential oil was evaluated. The proportions of essential oil/griseofulvin tested were 8 : 2 and 10 : 1 (w/w). Also, the acute dermal toxicity of this oil was evaluated on <b>guinea-pigs</b> (<b>Cavia</b> <b>porcellus)</b> using a standard method. Agar dilution method with serial dilution of the oil and the mixtures was used for antidermatophytic tests. The percentage inhibition of the fungal growth at each concentration was determined. The MIC of the essential oil was 80 μg mL - 1 for the tested dermatophytes. That of the 8 : 2 mixture was 20 μg mL - 1, whereas those of the 10 : 1 mixture were 8 and 10 μg mL - 1 for Microsporum gypseum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes, respectively. Compared to the control group, we noted no diarrhoea, no change in treated skin and on the fur appearance. In the contrary, the degree of sensitivity to noise, reaction to pinch, activity (locomotion) and reactivity decreased with increase in the dose. The LD 50 was determined to be 5 g kg - 1 b. wt. These data suggest that the essential oil of the leaves of Ageratum houstonianum contains antidermatophytic compound(s) and may not be toxic when used topically. A potentialisation effect was observed between the essential oil and griseofulvin...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the origin and}} diversity of domestic <b>guinea-pigs</b> <b>Cavia</b> <b>porcellus</b> (Linnaeus, 1758; Rodentia, Caviidae), we sequenced the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene of 12 domestic and 10 wild specimens from six species, including the two presumed as ancestral to the domestic one: Cavia tschudii and Cavia aperea. All maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses grouped C. porcellus with C. tschudii (mean K 2 P distance = 3. 2 %); best trees had 609 steps (CI = 0. 796; Bremer support Index (SI) = 28), and a -Ln = 4419. 52, with 100 % and 97 % bootstrap support respectively. This clade, supported by three substitutions and 96 % bootstrap, is also obtained in the cladistic analysis of corresponding amino acids. When the C. aperea node was forced to join C. porcellus, these trees were consistently longer, less likely and robust, and with less defining characters than the optimal one. All C. porcellus sequences also clustered in a node defined by 15 substitutions. The sub-node containing animals from city markets, pet shops and laboratories was characterized by four substitutions (one non-silent, SI = 7, and 91 % bootstrap). Some South American C. porcellus, called "criollos" (creoles) by local breeders, were more diverse. Probably, a particular clade from southern Peru and Chile may represent a pre-Columbian lineage. Mean K 2 P distance between C. tschudii and C. aperea was rather large, 7. 7 %. Cavia appeared as a robust node (100 % bootstrap). These results indicate that C. tschudii is the species most closely related to C. porcellus...|$|E

Minilivestock encompasses all animals of small site, and little-known in terras of production but usable as food, feed or revenues if not eaten. Sustainable breeding becomes possible, and should progressively replace uncontrolled gathering in the wild. Amongst vertebrates, an important meat supply is based on edible rodents like Thryonomys, Cricetomys, Xerus, Atherurus, Tenrec; Hydrochoerus, Dasyprocta, Myocastor, Capromys, Dolichotis, Agouti, etc. The saine applies to the <b>guinea-pig</b> <b>Cavia</b> <b>porcellus</b> and to frogs. Invertebrates farming is also practised through breeding of maggots, termites, butterflies (pupae and adults) for consumption or sale; giant snails are also highly appreciated in many African countries.

The demand for minilivestock product is high but there is still reluctance often from the official authorities, unfortunately.

40|$|Summary. The {{breeding}} {{characteristics of}} three species of wild guinea-pig (F. Caviidae) are reported. Cavia aperea, Galea musteloides and Micro-cavia australis were studied in Argentina {{in the field}} and in outdoor pens, and laboratory colonies of the two former species were also established in England. Pens ofdomestic <b>guinea-pigs</b> (<b>Cavia</b> <b>porcellus)</b> and of C. aperea =x. porcellus hybrids were maintained in Argentina for comparisons with C. aperea. C. aperea and G. musteloides gave birth in every month but there was a breeding peak in spring (September to December). Microcavia had a more restricted breeding season; in the field study area, births occurred only between August and April. Gestation length in C. aperea was variable but the mode was at 61 days, while the modes of Galea and Microcavia were much shorter at 53 and 54 days, respectively. All three species exhibited a post-partum oestrus and Galea may experience a lactation anoestrus. Oestrous cycle lengths in C. aperea and Galea varied consider-ably but the mean length in Cavia was 20 =. =+-=. days and in Galea it was 22 =. =+-=. days; in the latter species, the presence ofa male in the same cage was necessary for the induction of oestrus. Average litter size was 2 =. for C. aperea, 2 =. for Galea and 2 =. for Microcavia. In the Argentine colonies, the age at first conception in C. aperea and Galea varied with the time of year of birth, but this variation was not maintained under the more equable laboratory conditions...|$|E
