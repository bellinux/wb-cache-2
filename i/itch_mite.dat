50|$|Pyemotes herfsi, {{also known}} as the oak leaf gall mite or <b>itch</b> <b>mite,</b> is an ectoparasitic mite {{identified}} in central Europe in 1936 and subsequently found in India, Australia, and the United States. The mite parasitizes a variety of insect hosts and bites humans, causing red, itchy, and painful s (welts). The mites are barely visible, measuring about 0.2 millimeters; their great reproductive potential, small size, and high capacity for dispersal by wind make them difficult to control or avoid.|$|E
50|$|The {{discovery}} of the <b>itch</b> <b>mite</b> in 1687 marked scabies as the first disease of humans with a known cause. The Italian biologist Diacinto Cestoni showed in the 18th century that scabies {{is caused by the}} mite Sarcoptes scabiei, variety hominis. The disease produces intense, itchy skin rashes when the impregnated female tunnels into the stratum corneum of the skin and deposits eggs in the burrow. The larvae, which hatch in three to 10 days, move about on the skin, moult into a nymphal stage, and then mature into adult mites. The adult mites live three to four weeks in the host's skin.|$|E
5000|$|Rashes {{resulting}} from the bite of P. herfsi were first documented in Europe in 1936. The first documented outbreak in the US {{is thought to have}} occurred in 1994 in Kansas City, Kansas. The closely related straw <b>itch</b> <b>mite</b> (Pyemotes tritici), was initially suspected, but no specimens of this species were found. The reports indicated that the bites occurred on people after being outdoors in or near wooded areas. Based on this information, a search was initiated and resulted in the discovery of Pyemotes herfsi preying on midge larvae in leaf galls on pin oak trees.|$|E

50|$|Humans {{typically}} report <b>itching</b> from <b>mite</b> bites within 10 to 16 {{hours after}} contact. The victims {{often do not}} recall being bitten. The rash that results from the bites is usually described as a red patch with a small blister in the center, most often found on the neck, face, arms, or upper torso. A secondary bacterial infection sometimes arises when the bite is scratched. The suggested treatments include the application of calamine lotion, an antihistamine cream such as diphenhydramine, or a corticosteroid cream; a suggested preventive measure is the application of DEET before outdoor activity. Anecdotal reports from the Kansas outbreak, however, suggest that DEET might not provide complete protection against P. herfsi.|$|R
50|$|Newly {{emerged and}} mated females inject a neurotoxin-containing saliva into their hosts, which paralyzes the host and enables the gravid female mites {{to feed on}} the host's hemolymph. The {{posterior}} portion (opisthosoma) of the female enlarges as its progeny develops inside, and, within a few days, up to 250 adult mites emerge from the gravid female. Bruce and Wrensch (1990) found that progeny of the straw <b>itch</b> <b>mite</b> averaged 254 offspring of which 92% were females. Males emerge before the females, position themselves around the mother's genital opening, and mate with emerging females. Then, mated females disperse to find new hosts. These mites often are dispersed by wind, and when they land on vertebrate hosts, they attempt to feed, resulting in the bites. A life cycle can be completed within seven days, and progeny emergence can be extended to 15 days.|$|E
50|$|The {{misplaced}} {{theory of}} Humorism was largely dominant during this time. Arab physician Ibn Zuhr provided proof that scabies {{is caused by}} the <b>itch</b> <b>mite</b> and that it can be cured by removing the parasite without the need for purging, bleeding or other treatments called for by humorism, making a break with the humorism of Galen and Ibn Sina. Rhazes differentiated through careful observation the two diseases smallpox and measles, which were previously lumped together as a single disease that caused rashes. This was based on location and the time of the appearance of the symptoms and he also scaled the degree of severity and prognosis of infections according to the color and location of rashes. Al-Zahrawi was the first physician to describe an ectopic pregnancy, and the first physician to identify the hereditary nature of haemophilia.|$|E
5000|$|Sarcoptes anthracis was {{classified}} by Dmitri Ivanovsky in 1901 after first occurrences of infection on Asian Tufted Deers. The parasitic <b>itch</b> <b>mite</b> burrows into skin and causes sarcoptic mange, mostly seen on even-toed ungulates. Pregnant female mites tunnel into the stratum corneum of a host's skin and deposit {{eggs in the}} burrows. Young mites move about on the skin and molt into a [...] "nymphal" [...] stage, hosting Bacillus anthracis in their digestive tract. They act as a vector that carries and transmits anthrax to their hosts causing an infection, which often results in death because the immune system was weakened by scabies before. The high host specificity of the mites is {{held responsible for the}} fact that mostly even-toed ungulates struggled with these consequences. In late 1950s the last foci of infection were reported in semi-domesticated reindeers after which no greater incidences were observed.|$|E
500|$|Common {{forms of}} {{preventive}} medication for sheep are vaccinations and treatments for parasites. Both {{external and internal}} parasites are the most prevalent malady in sheep, and are either fatal, or reduce the productivity of flocks. Worms {{are the most common}} internal parasites. They are ingested during grazing, incubate within the sheep, and are expelled through the digestive system (beginning the cycle again). Oral anti-parasitic medicines, known as drenches, are given to a flock to treat worms, sometimes after worm eggs in the feces has been counted to assess infestation levels. Afterwards, sheep may be moved to a new pasture to avoid ingesting the same parasites. [...] External sheep parasites include: lice (for different parts of the body), sheep keds, nose bots, sheep <b>itch</b> <b>mites,</b> and maggots. Keds are blood-sucking parasites that cause general malnutrition and decreased productivity, but are not fatal. Maggots are those of the bot fly and the blow-fly. Fly maggots cause the extremely destructive condition of flystrike. Flies lay their eggs in wounds or wet, manure-soiled wool; when the maggots hatch they burrow into a sheep's flesh, eventually causing death if untreated. In addition to other treatments, crutching (shearing wool from a sheep's rump) is a common preventive method. Some countries allow mulesing, a practice that involves stripping away the skin on the rump to prevent fly-strike, normally performed when the sheep is a lamb. [...] Nose bots are fly larvae that inhabit a sheep's sinuses, causing breathing difficulties and discomfort. Common signs are a discharge from the nasal passage, sneezing, and frantic movement such as head shaking. External parasites may be controlled through the use of backliners, sprays or immersive sheep dips.|$|R
50|$|Skin disease {{caused by}} sarcoptic mites is variably called scabies, {{or in some}} {{countries}} mange. (The adjectives 'mangy' and 'scabby' are used similarly to 'lousy', as both a description of animals probably infested with mites or lice, respectively, and as a general expression of disgust. When wild animals such as foxes and coyotes are sometimes found heavily infested with sarcoptic mites, the description 'mangy' is apt.) Sarcoptes scabiei {{is an example of}} a mite that burrows within the living layers of the epidermis of its host. It infests many species of mammals. (Infestations of humans may be zoonotic, that is: transmitted from a wild or domestic animal, for example to a farmer or veterinarian handling an infested pig. Such an infestation is called a zoonosis. However, the subspecies or strain of S. scabiei adapted to humans is transmitted directly between humans, so it is not zoonotic.) Other sarcoptic mites of importance to livestock are in the genus Knemidokoptes (or Cnemidocoptes) which infest birds. Knemidokoptes gallinae, the depluming <b>itch</b> <b>mite</b> of poultry tends to infest the head and upper body, whilst K. mutans the scaly-leg mite, infests the feet.|$|E

40|$|Background: Infestation of {{the skin}} by the “itch mite” Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis results in a {{contagious}} skin infection in humans called “sca­bies”. By resolving morphology issues, {{the present study was}} designed to be acquainted with <b>itch</b> <b>mite</b> by molecular markers. Methods: The mite samples were collected from scabies patients by visiting government hospitals of twin City, Pakistan. For successful molecu­lar detection approach, preparation of Sarcoptes mite DNA by commer­cial DNA extraction kit method. Furthermore, two primers i. e. Sarms 15 F/R and 16 S D 1 /D 2 were used to amplify target sequence by using PCR. The amplified products were then separated by agarose gel, electrophoresis and analyzed after staining and visualizing in UV transillu­minator. Results: Analysis of PCR product showed one specific band of 178 bp with primer Sarms 15 F/R, while, with primer 16 S D 1 /D 2 bands of 460 bp and 600 bp were observed on 2 % agarose gel. The appearance of different band of 600 bp revealed that it might be due to heteroplasmy state present in the Pakistani Sarcoptes mites population.

40|$|Infestation of skin by the {{parasitic}} <b>itch</b> <b>mite</b> Sarcoptes scabiei afflicts 300 {{million people}} worldwide {{and there is}} a need for novel and efficient therapies. We have previously identified a multigene family of serine proteases comprising multiple catalytically inactive members (scabies mite-inactivated protease paralogs (SMIPPs)), which are secreted into the gut of S. scabiei. SMIPPs are located in the mite gut and in feces excreted into the upper epidermis. Scabies mites feed on epidermal protein, including host plasma; consequently, they are exposed to host defense mechanisms both internally and externally. We found that two recombinantly expressed SMIPPs inhibited all three pathways of the human complement system. Both SMIPPs exerted their inhibitory action due to binding of three molecules involved in the three different mechanisms which initiate complement: C 1 q, mannose-binding lectin, and properdin. Both SMIPPs bound to the stalk domains of C 1 q, possibly displacing or inhibiting C 1 r/C 1 s, which are associated with the same domain. Furthermore, we found that binding of both SMIPPs to properdin resulted in prevention of assembly of the alternative pathway convertases. However, the SMIPPs were not able to dissociate already formed convertases. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated the presence of C 1 q in the gut of scabies mites in skin burrows. We propose that SMIPPs minimize complement-mediated gut damage and thus create a favorable environment for the scabies mites...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} acaricidal {{activity}} of Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) oil (TTO) {{and some of}} its individual active components on the <b>itch</b> <b>mite</b> Sarcoptes scabiei var hominis. Design: In vitro acaricide sensitivity assessment. Setting: The Menzies School of Health Research laboratory, located near the Infectious Diseases Ward of the Royal Darwin Hospital, Australia, where patients are admitted and treated for crusted scabies. Participants: Scabies mites (S scabiei var hominis) were collected from a 20 -year-old Aboriginal woman admitted to the Royal Darwin Hospital with crusted scabies. Interventions: Within 3 hours of collection, scabies mites were placed in continuous direct contact with the TTO products and control acaricides and were observed at regular intervals. Main Outcome Measures: Percentage of mites dead at regular observation intervals between 5 minutes and 24 hours during continuous exposure to the TTO products and acaricides. Results: The 5 % TTO and active component terpinen- 4 -ol were highly effective in reducing mite survival times. Statistically significant differences in mite survival curves were observed for 5 % TTO, 2. 1 % terpinen- 4 -ol, 5 % permethrin, and ivermectin (100 μg/g of Emulsifying Ointment British Pharmacopoeia 88). In vivo effectiveness was also observed. Conclusions: Documentation of resistance against antiectoparasiticcompounds is increasing. Reported S scabiei treatment failures with lindane, crotamiton, and benzyl benzoate, as well as likely emerging resistance to 5 % permethrin and oral ivermectin, are of concern and advocate for the identification and development of novel acaricidal drugs. Tea tree oil is a membrane-active biocide extracted from the tree M alternifolia. It is a principal antimicrobial {{in a wide range of}} pharmaceuticals sold in Australia, with themain active component being oxygenated terpenoids. The results suggest that TTO has a potential role as a new topical acaricide and confirm terpinen- 4 -ol as the primary active component...|$|E

40|$|Examination {{performed}} five days,after provocative injections {{had been}} given revealed a remarkable swelling of glomeruli, multiplication of nuclei of endothelial cells, albuminous exudate in the capsular cavities, infiltration of round cells around the blood vessels and fibrinoid swelling of the arterial walls. In ten days, adhesions of capillaries in glomeruli had become apparent in considerable number of specimens, and proliferation of epithelial cells of Bowman 2 ̆ 7 s capsules had been observed in some specimens. In 15 days and thereafter, while adhesions of glomeruli were still prominent and epithelial cells of Bowman 2 ̆ 7 s capsules still tended more or less to proliferate, typical 2 ̆ 2 crescents 2 ̆ 2 had scarcely been noted. These changes coincided with those of diffuse glomerulonephritis experimentally proved by Prof. Masugi and his coworkers, and these findings agree with those of diffuse glomerulonephritis of socalled intracapillary type reported by Volhard and Fahr. Changes in the skin were seen in the subcutaneous tissue; they were intense edema and fibrinoid swelling of the connective tissue, around the blood vessels, formation of granuloma and hemorrhage in the perivascular tissue. No marked changes were observed in the glomeruli and skin in the control. The results of the histological studies conducted by the author in rats were similar to the findings made by Dr. Shinozaki in human scabious nephritis. The present experiments will prove that allergic reaction to itch mites {{can be one of}} the causes for scabious nephritis. It has been reported by many investigators that the symptoms of nephritis sometimes appear in the course of scabies. Scabious nephritishas been identified with a form of nephritis ascribed to the following causes: 1) Disturbance of the kidney due to absorption of the mite poison; 2) Disturbance of the kidney due to absorption of bacterial poison as a result of secondary pyogenic infection; 3) Disturbance of the kidney caused by the stimulus of drugs used for therapeutic purposes; and 4) Stimulation of scabies producing albuminuria in the patients with the kidneies having an antecedent history of disease. Dr. Shinozaki has reported that the occurrence of glomerulonephritis was high in the cases of human scabies, and that allergy would play an important role in bringing about this change. He has also reported that the following three substances would be identified as antigens that might produce allergic reactions : 1) Foreigh protein of the itch mite; 2) Foreign protein of bacteria responsible for secondary pyogenic infection, and 3) Intermediate products of tissue albumin which has been destroyed through these infections. In the present experiments, the author performed investigations to prove if foreign protein of the <b>itch</b> <b>mite</b> caused glomerulonephritis due to allergic reaction.
