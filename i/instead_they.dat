5|$|Viral populations do {{not grow}} through cell division, {{because they are}} acellular. <b>Instead,</b> <b>they</b> use the {{machinery}} and metabolism of a host cell to produce multiple copies of themselves, and they assemble in the cell.|$|E
5|$|Crucially, the Prussians did not {{retreat to}} the east, along their own lines of communication. <b>Instead,</b> <b>they,</b> too, fell back northwards—parallel to Wellington's line of march, still within {{supporting}} distance and in communication with him throughout. The Prussians rallied on Bülow's IV Corps, which had not been engaged at Ligny and was in a strong position south of Wavre.|$|E
5|$|Despite the K Foundation's {{reported}} moratorium, further national screenings of {{the film}} organised by Chris Brook took place as planned. At each screening, Drummond and Cauty announced they would not answer questions after the film; <b>instead,</b> <b>they</b> would ask questions of the audience. These screenings were held in Bradford, Hull, Liverpool, Cheltenham Ladies College, Eton College, Bristol, Aberystwyth, Glastonbury Tor and Brick Lane, London.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{phrases that}} require the {{indicative}} <b>instead,</b> because <b>they</b> express certainty, include: ...|$|R

5|$|Fans of Ultra {{were open}} about liking it {{and sent a}} {{significant}} amount of correspondence to Image and the Luna Brothers. The series was intended as a finite story, but its success prompted Image to ask the creators to continue the story. <b>Instead,</b> <b>they</b> chose to move on to a different project, Girls, which began in May 2005.|$|E
5|$|Gignac {{and colleagues}} also noted, however, that bone {{puncture}} marks from Deinonychus are relatively rare, and unlike larger theropods with many known puncture marks like Tyrannosaurus, Deinonychus {{probably did not}} frequently bite through or eat bone. <b>Instead,</b> <b>they</b> probably used their high bite force in defense or prey capture, rather than feeding.|$|E
5|$|In 1996 CMLL {{decided not}} to {{acknowledge}} that La Pantera had lost the CMLL World Welterweight Championship during a tour of Japan, declaring the title vacant <b>instead.</b> <b>They</b> held a 16-man tournament from May 7 to May 21, 1996, to crown a new champion. In the finals Máscara Mágica defeated El Felino to become the seventh champion.|$|E
5000|$|Quadrangles {{that lie}} on the pole of a body are also {{sometimes}} called [...] "areas" [...] <b>instead,</b> since <b>they</b> are circular rather than four-sided.|$|R
50|$|Originally, plans {{had been}} to number them E7001-E7010, but once rebuilt they were {{numbered}} E6101-E6110 <b>instead.</b> Later <b>they</b> were renumbered 74001-74010 under the TOPS system.|$|R

5|$|In 2002, a {{molecular}} study by Austin Mast again {{showed that the}} three eastern species formed a natural group, or clade, but they were only distantly related to {{other members of the}} series Banksia. <b>Instead,</b> <b>they</b> formed a sister group to a large group comprising the series Prostratae, Ochraceae, Tetragonae (including Banksia elderiana), Banksia lullfitzii and Banksia baueri.|$|E
5|$|In Hell on Wheels season 1, Eva tells Elam she was traded, {{for three}} {{blankets}} and a horse, to the tribe that tattooed her. In episode 8 ("Derailed"), Eva tells Lily the Yavapi hacked up and scalped Eva's parents, and raped her sister then bashed out her brains with rocks, but Eva had the pox and they wouldn't touch her. <b>Instead,</b> <b>they</b> traded her to some Mojave.|$|E
5|$|In Roman times, {{parsnips}} {{were believed}} to be an aphrodisiac. However, parsnips do not typically feature in modern Italian cooking. <b>Instead,</b> <b>they</b> are fed to pigs, particularly those bred to make Parma ham. In traditional Chinese medicine, the root of Chinese parsnip is used as an herbal medicine ingredient.|$|E

25|$|They do not {{generate}} local clustering and triadic closures. <b>Instead</b> because <b>they</b> have a constant, random, {{and independent}} probability of two nodes being connected, ER graphs {{have a low}} clustering coefficient.|$|R
5|$|Penny (Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting), Amy (Mayim Bialik) and Bernadette (Melissa Rauch) go for {{afternoon}} tea at a tea parlor {{in an attempt}} to feel more like adults. Once they arrive, they see that only mothers and their children are there; they decide to hit the lobby bar <b>instead.</b> <b>They</b> discuss how they do not feel grown up and how being an adult is not necessarily a good thing.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of food riots had ended by 1801, {{and there were}} certain political undertones to the actions, though lack of leadership meant that little came of it. By the 1870s, 60% of Wales was owned by 570 families, most of whom did no farming. <b>Instead,</b> <b>they</b> employed workers, who were forced to vote Tory or lose their jobs.|$|E
5|$|A {{prominent}} predator is the short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) that {{eats the}} virgin queens during nuptial flight {{due to their}} high percentage of fat. Echidnas do not consume Iridomyrmex ants all year; <b>instead,</b> <b>they</b> usually attack nests during August to October, which is when the winged females and males, known as alates emerge from their nest. Queens will also face more threats during nuptial flight or after; birds such as currawongs, magpies and ravens, attracted by recently excavated soil, will dig out nests shortly after the queens have founded their colonies. Parasitic flatworms in the class Cestoda are known to infect Iridomyrmex.|$|E

5|$|After decades, the Oneida became {{frustrated}} {{by the failure of}} the case to settle. <b>Instead,</b> <b>they</b> began to purchase land within the claim area in fee simple, asserting sovereignty over the re-acquired parcels and refusing to pay property tax. In City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York (2005), the Supreme Court held that laches barred the re-assertion of sovereignty over ancestral land re-acquired in fee simple; the Court did not consider whether the original aboriginal title over the disputed parcels was validly extinguished, and thus did not disturb its holding in Oneida II.|$|E
5|$|After the Omagh bombing, the RIRA {{leadership}} {{were unwilling}} to launch a full-scale campaign in Northern Ireland due {{to the possibility of}} civilians being killed. <b>Instead</b> <b>they</b> decided to launch a series of attacks in England, in particular London, which they hoped would attract disenchanted Provisional IRA members to join the RIRA. On 1 June 2000 a bomb damaged Hammersmith Bridge; a symbolic target for Irish republican paramilitary groups. The bridge had been targeted by the Irish Republican Army on 29 March 1939 as part of its Sabotage Campaign, and by the Provisional IRA on 24 April 1996.|$|E
5|$|Alternative views {{have been}} {{expressed}} that the amendments were not seeking {{to replace the}} common law of judicial review. <b>Instead,</b> <b>they</b> borrowed from the common law by turning the clock back, and merely clarified the limits of judicial power {{in relation to the}} ISA. It has also been noted that the amendments do not compel the application of Lee Mau Seng, a High Court decision. If Lee Mau Seng is wrong, the Court of Appeal can still overrule it now.|$|E

5|$|Although Lenin was {{influenced}} by agrarian-socialist Pëtr Tkachëvi, he and the Social-Democrats clashed with the Socialist–Revolutionary Party (SR), who were inspired by the defunct People's Freedom Party. Advocating a Narodnik agrarian-socialist platform, the SR emphasised the revolutionary role of the peasant, who in 1881 numbered 75 million, {{in contrast to the}} 1 million urban proletariat in Russia. In contrast, the Marxists believed that the peasant class' primary motivation was to own their land, and that they were capitalists; <b>instead,</b> <b>they</b> saw the proletariat as the revolutionary force to advance socialism.|$|E
5|$|Although congressional Republicans {{had opposed}} Clinton's Deficit Reduction Act of 1993, a key {{aspect of the}} 1994 Contract with America was {{the promise of a}} {{balanced}} federal budget. After the end of the government shutdown, Gingrich and other Republican leaders acknowledged that Congress {{would not be able to}} draft a balanced budget in 1996. <b>Instead,</b> <b>they</b> opted to approve some small reductions that were already approved by the White House and to wait until the next election season.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the team}} was {{considered}} successful, {{in spite of the}} failure to recapture The Ashes, the problems between the players and the administrators continued. Before the team departed Australia, the players arbitrarily replaced one of the selected players without recourse to the ACC. After the final match in England, Trott and his players broke an agreement to return home in time for the 1896–97 Australian season. <b>Instead,</b> <b>they</b> organised matches in North America and New Zealand.|$|E
