5|$|A high {{accident}} rate may also occur because Thoroughbreds, {{particularly in the}} United States, are first raced as 2-year-olds, well before they are completely mature. Though they may appear full-grown and are in superb muscular condition, their bones are not fully formed. However, catastrophic injury rates are higher in 4- and 5-year-olds than in 2- and 3-year-olds. Some believe that correct, slow training of a young horse (including foals) may actually be beneficial to the overall soundness of the animal. This is because, during the training process, microfractures occur in the leg followed by bone remodeling. If the remodeling is given sufficient time to <b>heal,</b> <b>the</b> bone becomes stronger. If proper remodeling occurs before hard training and racing begins, the horse will have a stronger musculoskeletal system and will have a decreased chance of injury.|$|E
5|$|After {{losing a}} Casket match to Yokozuna at the 1994 Royal Rumble, The Undertaker {{did not appear}} in the WWF for several months. In reality, he was given time off to allow a back injury to <b>heal.</b> <b>The</b> WWF foreshadowed his return by airing videos of people who claimed to have seen The Undertaker. Eventually, DiBiase, who {{introduced}} The Undertaker to the WWF in 1990, claimed to have brought The Undertaker back to the WWF. but Paul Bearer informed him that DiBiase’s Undertaker was an impostor and that Bearer had located the true Undertaker. This led to a match at SummerSlam pitting The Undertaker against The Undertaker. In the buildup to the match, Leslie Nielsen perform short segments trying to solve the mystery of how two Undertakers could exist in a spinoff of his roles on Police Squad! and The Naked Gun films.|$|E
5|$|After playing League cricket for Blackpool in 1939, on the {{outbreak}} of war Larwood left the game altogether, to work away from the public eye as a market gardener. In 1946 he used his savings to buy a sweet shop in Blackpool. Although he generally kept away from organised cricket and avoided all personal publicity, he was persuaded to attend a farewell luncheon for Don Bradman {{at the end of}} the Australians' 1948 tour. He and Bradman exchanged polite courtesies, though he was warmly welcomed by other members of the Australian team, including their premier fast bowler Ray Lindwall. The following year Larwood became one of 26 former professional Test cricketers awarded honorary membership of the MCC. This recognition, he said, went some way to help <b>heal</b> <b>the</b> hurt he had felt over his treatment by the game's ruling body 15 years earlier.|$|E

5|$|Battles {{take place}} on a grid-based battle arena, with {{characters}} and enemies moving according to their position on the grid. Four commands are available to the party: Attack (fight enemies), Contact (talk with an enemy), Analyze (check an enemy for its strength and weaknesses), and Form (rearrange the party on the grid). The character's main means of attack is their Persona, beings summoned into battle to cast a spell that can <b>heal</b> <b>the</b> party, and inflict physical or elemental damage on an enemy. Each Persona has access to up to eight skills, and each character can change their Persona during their turn. Personas earn experience points independent of the characters they are assigned to, and gain new abilities through extended use. Experience is awarded based on how often the player uses certain characters or Personas. Alongside their Personas, each character is able to attack with an equipped melee weapon or firearm, use an item, or attempt {{to talk with the}} demons that act as the game's standard enemies.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{resignation}} of Strachan {{at the end of}} the 2008–09 season, Brown's former Hibs boss Tony Mowbray became Celtic manager. Brown underwent surgery during pre-season in an attempt to rectify his ankle problem, but this didn't work, and he played matches despite not being fully fit. Celtic had a fairly good start to their league campaign, going into the first Old Firm match four points ahead of Rangers, but they lost 2–1. Celtic beat Dynamo Moscow in Champions League qualifying, but then lost the play-off to Arsenal, which meant that they dropped into the Europa League group stage. The 1–0 home defeat by Hamburg on 22 October 2009 was Brown's last action of the year, as Celtic initially chose to rest him in another effort to <b>heal</b> <b>the</b> ankle injury. This proved unsuccessful, and he underwent a second operation in Rotterdam to try and clear up his ankle injury.|$|E
