5|$|Rotblat {{retired from}} St Bartholomew's in 1976. In 1975–1976, he was Montague Visiting Professor of International Relations at the University of Edinburgh. He {{believed}} that scientists have an individual moral responsibility and, {{just as the}} <b>Hippocratic</b> <b>Oath</b> provides a code of conduct for physicians, he thought that scientists should have their own code of moral conduct, a <b>Hippocratic</b> <b>Oath</b> for scientists. During his tenure {{as president of the}} Pugwash conferences, Rotblat nominated Israeli nuclear technician Mordechai Vanunu for the Nobel Peace Prize every year from 1988 to 2004. Vanunu had disclosed the extent of Israel's nuclear weapons programme and consequently spent 18 years in prison, including more than 11 years in solitary confinement.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Hippocratic</b> <b>Oath,</b> {{a seminal}} {{document}} on {{the ethics of}} medical practice, was attributed to Hippocrates in antiquity although new information shows {{it may have been}} written after his death. This is probably the most famous document of the Hippocratic Corpus. Recently the authenticity of the document's author has come under scrutiny. While the Oath is rarely used in its original form today, it serves as a foundation for other, similar oaths and laws that define good medical practice and morals. Such derivatives are regularly taken today by medical graduates about to enter medical practice.|$|E
5|$|Some {{clinical}} {{symptoms and}} signs {{have been named}} after Hippocrates as he {{is believed to be}} the first person to describe those. Hippocratic face is the change produced in the countenance by death, or long sickness, excessive evacuations, excessive hunger, and the like. Clubbing, a deformity of the fingers and fingernails, is also known as Hippocratic fingers. Hippocratic succussion is the internal splashing noise of hydropneumothorax or pyopneumothorax. Hippocratic bench (a device which uses tension to aid in setting bones) and Hippocratic cap-shaped bandage are two devices named after Hippocrates. Hippocratic Corpus and <b>Hippocratic</b> <b>Oath</b> are also his namesakes. The drink hypocras is also believed to be invented by Hippocrates. Risus sardonicus, a sustained spasming of the face muscles may also be termed the Hippocratic Smile.|$|E
2500|$|This mentality {{carries over}} into practice. Peer {{recognition}} {{goes to the}} most thorough and aggressive physicians. The prudent physician is not deemed particularly competent, but rather inadequate. This culture is further reinforced by a unique understanding of professional obligations, specifically, the <b>Hippocratic</b> <b>Oath's</b> admonition to [...] "use my power to help the sick {{to the best of}} my ability and judgment" [...] as an imperative to do everything for the patient regardless of cost or effect on others.|$|R
5000|$|Physicians and Psychologists {{use of the}} “No Blood, No Foul” {{policy to}} get around their <b>Hippocratic</b> <b>oaths</b> have sparked controversy, [...] "It is unthinkable that any {{psychologist}} could assert that stress positions, forced nudity, sleep deprivation, exploiting phobias, and waterboarding — along with other forms of torture techniques that the American Psychological Association has condemned and prohibited — cause no lasting damage to a human being's psyche". [...] “The American Psychiatric Association and the American Psychological Association adopted Position Statements absolutely prohibiting their members from participating in torture under any and all circumstances, and, to a limited degree, forbidding involvement in interrogations”.|$|R
50|$|Of {{the seven}} {{articles}} in the Vejjavatapada, the first {{highlights the importance of}} care (hita), kindness (dayā) and compassion (anukampā) in the healing process. The second concerns the physician's responsibility to be fully trained in and skilled in the administration of drugs, given that the physician's raison d'Ṝtre is effective healing and that some medicines and surgical procedures can be potentially dangerous. According to Dhammika, this second article is equivalent to the <b>Hippocratic</b> <b>Oath's</b> third and fourth stipulation that the physician shall never do anything to harm a patient, even if asked to do so. It is the primum non nocere of Western medical ethics. The fourth article counsels the physician to put their welfare above his or her personal gain. The fifth article recognizes that at times it might be necessary to deal with the loathsome aspects of the human body and that the physician should do this with detachment, both for his or her own mental balance and so as not to embarrass the patient. The sixth article recognizes the fact that spiritual counselling or comfort can have a part to play in healing and that the physician needs to have at least some abilities in this area. There are several discourses which describe the Buddha doing just this. The seventh and final article requires the physician to minister to the patient even if all the signs indicate {{that he or she is}} not responding to the treatment and will probably die. Even a dying patient may needs palliative care and being made physically and mentally comfortable. In an interesting comparison to this, Srusruta, the father of Indian medicine, advises the physician not to treat a patient he suspects of being incurable so as not to be blamed for the patient's death and injure his reputation.|$|R
5|$|From 1945 to 1947, {{eighteen}} human {{test subjects}} were injected with plutonium without informed consent. The tests {{were used to}} create diagnostic tools to determine the uptake of plutonium in the body {{in order to develop}} safety standards for working with plutonium. Ebb Cade was an unwilling participant in medical experiments that involved injection of 4.7 micrograms of Plutonium on 10 April 1945 at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. This experiment was under the supervision of Harold Hodge. Other experiments directed by the United States Atomic Energy Commission and the Manhattan Project continued into the 1970s. The Plutonium Files chronicles the lives of the subjects of the secret program by naming each person involved and discussing the ethical and medical research conducted in secret by the scientists and doctors. The episode is now considered to be a serious breach of medical ethics and of the <b>Hippocratic</b> <b>Oath.</b>|$|E
25|$|From {{the time}} of the <b>Hippocratic</b> <b>Oath</b> {{questions}} of the ethics of medical practice have been widely discussed, and codes of practice have been gradually developed as a response to advances in scientific medicine.|$|E
25|$|They {{find that}} {{conversion}} therapy is ineffective, risky {{and can be}} harmful. Anecdotal claims of cures are counterbalanced by assertions of harm, and the American Psychiatric Association, for example, cautions ethical practitioners under the <b>Hippocratic</b> <b>oath</b> to do no harm and to refrain from attempts at conversion therapy.|$|E
40|$|A {{chilling}} subplot in {{the twentieth-century}} saga of state-sponsored mass murder, torture, and other atrocities was the widespread incidence of medical complicity. Nazi doctors’ human “experiments” and assistance in genocidal killing {{are the most}} oft-cited exemplar, but wartime Japanese physicians’ human vivisection and other grotesque practices rivaled the Nazi medical horrors. Measured by these standards, Soviet psychiatrists’ role in repressing dissent, Latin American and Turkish military doctors’ complicity in torture, and even the South African medical profession’s systematic involvement in apartheid may seem, to some, almost prosaic. Yet these and other reported cases of medical complicity in human rights abuse compel an inquiry into medicine’s vulnerability to becoming an adjunct to illicit state purposes. To many practicing physicians, the idea of such vulnerability may seem anathema. The <b>Hippocratic</b> <b>Oath’s</b> pledge of undivided loyalty—“[i]n every house where I come, I will enter only {{for the good of}} my patients” — and the oft-quoted maxim, “first do no harm,” express the profession’s ethical commitment to the sick people it primarily serves. Well-meaning practitioners might reasonably presume that this commitment safeguards the profession against involvement in illicit purposes and that physicians who collude in human rights abuses are a rogue element, not evidence of a deeper problem. But I shall argue here that the Hippocratic commitment of undivided loyalty to patients tells {{only part of the story}} of medicine’s purposes, that clinical work in contemporary societies serves myriad state and social ends, and that physician complicity in state-sanctioned human rights abuse is a perverse corollary of this seldom- acknowledged reality. Were the ethic of undivided loyalty and the maxim, “first do no harm,” the inviolate precepts many take them to be, then efforts to prevent such complicity could concentrate on the conceptually simple tasks of dissuading physicians from doing anything that serves state purposes at their patients’ expense and pressing governments to respect the profession’s adherence to these precepts. But the pervasive links between clinical work and state purposes — in the industrialized democracies no less than in repressive regimes — complicate the work of prevention and put physicians at risk for becoming collaborators when state purposes turn illicit. This risk is heightened by the near-absence of ethical guidance as to how to distinguish between acceptable and intolerable furtherance of state objectives...|$|R

25|$|The <b>Hippocratic</b> <b>Oath,</b> {{written in}} the 5th century BC {{provides}} the earliest protocol for professional conduct and ethical behavior a young physician needed to abide by in life and in treating and managing the health and privacy of his patients. The multiple volumes of the Hippocratic corpus and the <b>Hippocratic</b> <b>Oath</b> elevated and separated the standards of proper Hippocratic medical conduct and its fundamental medical and surgical principles from other practitioners of folk medicine often laden with superstitious constructs, and/or of specialists of sorts some of whom would endeavor to carry out invasive body procedures with dubious consequences, such as lithotomy. Works from the Hippocartic corpus include; On the Articulations or On Joints, On Fractures, On the Instruments of Reduction, The Physician's Establishment or Surgery, On Injuries of the Head, On Ulcers, On Fistulae, and On Hemorrhoids.|$|E
25|$|Until Corner Gas, {{his most}} famous role on {{television}} was his award-winning role as Leon Robinovitch, a left-wing lawyer, on Street Legal. His more notable television work includes 1998's Nothing Sacred (a movie for which he also co-produced and appeared in the stage version), Night Heat and This Is Wonderland. He also appeared as Hank Stewart in the <b>Hippocratic</b> <b>Oath</b> episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents for AHF Film Productions.|$|E
25|$|In medicine, Hippocrates (c. 460 BC– c. 370 BC) and his {{followers}} {{were the first to}} describe many diseases and medical conditions and developed the <b>Hippocratic</b> <b>Oath</b> for physicians, still relevant and in use today. Herophilos (335–280 BC) was the first to base his conclusions on dissection of the human body and to describe the nervous system. Galen (129– c. 200 AD) performed many audacious operations—including brain and eye surgeries— that were not tried again for almost two millennia.|$|E
25|$|In March 2004, 15,000 {{public health}} workers were {{dismissed}} including nurses, midwives, school health visitors and orderlies. In February 2005 all hospitals outside Aşgabat were ordered shut, with the reasoning that the sick {{should come to}} the capital for treatment. According to the paper Neitralniy Turkmenistan physicians were ordered {{to swear an oath}} to the President, replacing the <b>Hippocratic</b> <b>Oath.</b> All libraries outside of the capital were also closed, as Niyazov believed that the only books that most Turkmen needed to read were the Qur'an and his Ruhnama.|$|E
25|$|To many, the specialness {{of health}} care meant that cost {{should not be a}} {{consideration}} in care. Ethical physicians could and should not consider money in deciding what they should do for sick patients. Patients were to receive whatever services they needed, regardless of its cost. Reasoning based on cost has been strenuously resisted; it violated the <b>Hippocratic</b> <b>Oath,</b> was associated with rationing, and derided as putting a price on life, akin to the economist who knew the price of everything but the value of nothing. Indeed, many physicians were willing to lie to get patients what they needed from insurance companies that were trying to hold costs down.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} other codes of conduct. The <b>Hippocratic</b> <b>Oath</b> {{discusses}} basic principles for medical professionals. This document {{dates back to}} the fifth century BCE. Both The Declaration of Helsinki (1964) and The Nuremberg Code (1947) are two well-known and well respected documents contributing to medical ethics. Other important markings in the history of Medical Ethics include Roe v. Wade in 1973 and the development of Hemodialysis in the 1960s. As this field continues to develop and change throughout history, the focus remains on fair, balanced, and moral thinking. Medical ethics encompasses a practical application in clinical settings as well as scholarly work on its history, philosophy, and sociology.|$|E
25|$|Historically, Western {{medical ethics}} may {{be traced to}} {{guidelines}} on the duty of physicians in antiquity, such as the <b>Hippocratic</b> <b>Oath,</b> and early Christian teachings. The first code of medical ethics, Formula Comitis Archiatrorum, {{was published in the}} 5th century, during the reign of the Ostrogothic king Theodoric the Great. In the medieval and early modern period, the field is indebted to Islamic scholarship such as Ishaq ibn Ali al-Ruhawi (who wrote the Conduct of a Physician, the first book dedicated to medical ethics), Avicenna's Canon of Medicine and Muhammad ibn Zakariya ar-Razi (known as Rhazes in the West), Jewish thinkers such as Maimonides, Roman Catholic scholastic thinkers such as Thomas Aquinas, and the case-oriented analysis (casuistry) of Catholic moral theology. These intellectual traditions continue in Catholic, Islamic and Jewish medical ethics.|$|E
25|$|Epistulae diversorum de qualitate et observatione medicinae (“Letters {{by various}} authors on ‘quality’ and ‘observation’ in medicine”), {{a series of}} seven epistles, each {{attributed}} to a different medical writer. The epistles serve as a literary device for discussing methodology, diagnosis, {{and the importance of}} ethical and accurate treatment. They are not, or not wholly, fictional; just as Marcellus’s work begins with a prefatory epistle addressed to his sons, the seven letters represent prefaces to other authors’ works, some now lost. Marcellus has detached them from the works they headed and presented them collectively, translating, sometimes taking liberties, those originally in Greek, as a kind of bonus for his sons. For instance, the “Letter from Celsus”, addressed to a Callistus, deals with the physician’s ethical duty in relation to the <b>Hippocratic</b> <b>Oath.</b>|$|E

500|$|However, the {{achievements}} of the writers of the Corpus, the practitioners of Hippocratic medicine, and the actions of Hippocrates himself were often commingled; thus very little is known about what Hippocrates actually thought, wrote, and did. Hippocrates is commonly portrayed as the [...] of the ancient physician, and credited with coining the <b>Hippocratic</b> <b>Oath,</b> still relevant and in use today. He is also credited with greatly advancing the systematic study of clinical medicine, summing up the medical knowledge of previous schools, and prescribing practices for physicians through the Hippocratic Corpus and other works.|$|E

500|$|In the courtroom, Peter exaggerates the story. The {{judge is}} not convinced, and even recalls his own {{prostate}} exam being uneventful. However, after further prompting from Peter, the judge [...] "remembers" [...] being abused and declares Hartman guilty, revoking his license. As Peter celebrates his victory at The Drunken Clam, his frequent need to urinate causes great concern among his friends, where Seamus informs {{him that his}} prostate may be infected. However, his lawsuit makes it unlikely that any doctor would treat him, and indeed, not one does. Peter visits Dr. Hartman in disguise and unsuccessfully tries to trick him into giving the exam, but the doctor decides that his <b>Hippocratic</b> <b>Oath</b> requires him {{to go ahead with}} the examination anyway. Peter's constant urinating turns out to be due to a minor infection and blockage caused by Mr. Sulu somehow being up Peter's rectum. In the epilogue, Dr. Hartman's license is reinstated and he and Peter reconcile.|$|E
500|$|The ancient Greeks gleaned much {{of their}} {{medicinal}} knowledge from Egypt and Mesopotamia. Hippocrates (460–377 BCE), the [...] "father of medicine" [...] (renowned for the eponymous <b>Hippocratic</b> <b>oath),</b> used about 400 drugs, most being of plant origin. However, the first Greek herbal of any note was written by Diocles of Carystus {{in the fourth century}} BC—although nothing remains of this except its mention in the written record. It was Aristotle’s pupil Theophrastus (371–287 BCE) in his Historia Plantarum, (better known as the Enquiry into Plants) and De Causis Plantarum (On the Causes of Plants) that established the scientific method of careful and critical observation associated with modern botanical science. Based largely on Aristotle’s notes, the Ninth Book of his Enquiry deals specifically with medicinal herbs and their uses including the recommendations of herbalists and druggists of the day, and his plant descriptions often included their natural habitat and geographic distribution. With the formation of the Alexandrian School c. 330 BCE medicine flourished and written herbals of this period included those of the physicians Herophilus, Mantias, Andreas of Karystos, Appolonius Mys, and Nicander. The work of rhizomatist (the rhizomati were the doctors of the day, berated by Theophrastus for their superstition) Krateuas (fl. 110 BCE) is of special note because he initiated the tradition of the illustrated herbal in the first century BCE.|$|E

2500|$|Millennia ago, Hippocrates {{recognized}} {{the potential for}} injuries that arise from the well-intentioned actions of healers.

2500|$|The rule {{dates back}} to at least the <b>Hippocratic</b> <b>Oath,</b> which reads: [...] Whatever, in {{connection}} with my professional service, or not in connection with it, I see or hear, {{in the life of}} men, which ought not to be spoken of abroad, I will not divulge, as reckoning that all such should be kept secret.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Hippocratic</b> <b>Oath</b> makes {{explicit}} statements against {{deliberate harm}} {{not in the}} patient's best interests. These statements are often translated as [...] "I will prescribe regimens {{for the good of}} my patients according to my ability and my judgment" [...] and [...] "to never deliberately do harm to anyone, for anyone else's interest." [...] (Note: these statements are formulations of the ethical principles of beneficence and non-maleficence.) ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{chiropractic}} oath is {{a modern}} variation of the classical <b>Hippocratic</b> <b>Oath</b> historically taken by physicians and other healthcare professionals swearing to practice their professions ethically. The American Chiropractic Association (ACA) has an ethical code [...] "based upon the acknowledgement that the social contract dictates the profession's responsibilities to the patient, the public, and the profession; and upholds the fundamental principle that the paramount purpose of the chiropractic doctor's professional services shall be to benefit the patient." [...] The International Chiropractor's Association (ICA) also has a set of professional canons.|$|E

He found this abhorrent and refused to take part; this was confirmed by witnesses' testimony at his trial. The book on SS physicians of Auschwitz by Robert Jay Lifton (1986) mentions Münch as the only physician whose commitment to the <b>Hippocratic</b> <b>oath</b> proved stronger than that to the SS.|$|E

2500|$|The ancient Greek {{physician}} Hippocrates {{is considered}} the [...] "father of western medicine", who {{laid the foundation for}} a rational approach to medicine. Hippocrates introduced the <b>Hippocratic</b> <b>Oath</b> for physicians, which is still relevant and in use today, and was the first to categorize illnesses as acute, chronic, endemic and epidemic, and use terms such as, [...] "exacerbation, relapse, resolution, crisis, paroxysm, peak, and convalescence". After the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the onset of the Early Middle Ages, the Greek tradition of medicine went into decline in Western Europe, although it continued uninterrupted in the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire. Today the country is a medical services centre and an evolving destination of medical tourism.|$|E
