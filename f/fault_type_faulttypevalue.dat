30|$|It was {{inferred}} from the stress tensor inversion that the stress {{state is a}} reverse <b>fault</b> <b>type</b> in the deepest part in the focal region {{before and after the}} mainshock, but, in the central part, the stress state changed from reverse <b>fault</b> <b>type</b> before the mainshock to normal <b>fault</b> <b>type</b> after the mainshock. In this way, we succeeded in estimating the depth-dependent stress states after the mainshock.

40|$|AbstractDependability is a {{qualitative}} term {{referring to a}} system's ability to meet its service requirements {{in the presence of}} <b>faults.</b> The <b>types</b> and number of faults covered by a system play a primary role in determining the level of dependability which that system can potentially provide. Given the variety and multiplicity of <b>fault</b> <b>types,</b> to simplify the design process, the system algorithm design often focuses on specific <b>fault</b> <b>types,</b> resulting in either over-optimistic (all fault permanent) or over-pessimistic (all faults malicious) dependable system designs. A more practical and realistic approach is to recognize that faults of varied severity levels and of differing occurrence probabilities may appear as combinations rather than the assumed single <b>fault</b> <b>type</b> occurrences. The ability to allow the user to select/customize a particular combination of <b>fault</b> <b>types</b> of varied severity characterizes the proposed customizable fault/error model (CFEM). The CFEM organizes diverse fault categories into a cohesive framework by classifying faults according to the effect they have on the required system services rather than by targeting the source of the fault condition. In this paper, we develop (a) the complete framework for the CFEM fault classification, (b) the voting functions applicable under the CFEM, and (c) the fundamental distributed services of consensus and convergence under the CFEM on which dependable distributed functionality can be supported...|$|R

30|$|We have {{examined}} the focal mechanism distributions in the source region of the 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake, {{before and after the}} mainshock, using F-net data, and then performed a stress tensor inversion by using the multiple inverse method. It is found that earthquakes were mainly reverse <b>fault</b> <b>type</b> events all over the source region before the main shock, whereas, after the main shock, many normal <b>fault</b> <b>type</b> events occurred in the hanging wall but focal mechanisms did not change in the deepest part in the source region. It is inferred from the stress tensor inversion that the stress state is a reverse <b>fault</b> <b>type</b> in the deepest part before, and after, the mainshock but that, in the central part, the stress state changed from reverse <b>fault</b> <b>type</b> before the mainshock to normal <b>fault</b> <b>type</b> after the mainshock. These results suggest that the absolute shear stress on the plate boundary fault in this region was almost completely released by the mainshock. Furthermore, we examined, in detail, the focal mechanism distributions and stress states in the shallower part near the trench axis off the Miyagi Prefecture and found that strike-slip events with the P-axis in the NS direction occurred in the footwall east of the mainshock hypocenter. This finding can be well explained by a slip model with a large moment release near the hypocenter. Our analysis constrains the spatial distribution of the moment release of the 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake around the mainshock hypocenter rather than {{in the vicinity of the}} trench axis.|$|R

The studied system consists of six DFIG wind turbines with a capacity of 1.5  MW for each of them. The operation mechanism of proposed technique is used to connect a set of crowbar resistors in different connection ways via activation of controllable circuit breakers (CBs) depending on the detected <b>fault</b> <b>type.</b> For each phase of DFIG, a crowbar resistor {{is connected in parallel}} with a controllable CB and all of them are connected in series to grid terminals. The adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) networks are designed to detect the fault occurrence, classify the <b>fault</b> <b>type,</b> activate the CBs for crowbar resistors associated with faulted phases during fault period, and deactivate them after fault clearance. The effectiveness of proposed CBFT protection technique is investigated for different <b>fault</b> <b>types</b> such as symmetrical and unsymmetrical faults taking into account the single-phase to ground fault is the most frequently <b>fault</b> <b>type</b> that occurs in power systems.
