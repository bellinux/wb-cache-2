5|$|His {{subsequent}} {{involvement in}} a conference promoting adolescent sexuality caused the party to announce that {{it would no longer}} publish his material. In March 1933 Freud told <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> contract with the International Psychoanalytic Publishers to publish Character Analysis had been cancelled. Sharaf writes that this was almost certainly because of Reich's stance on teenage sex.|$|E

5|$|A {{variation}} of this origin of Chamba {{is that it}} originated as a hermitage which Champavati, a devout Hindu, used to frequent. The king, being suspicious of his daughter's fidelity, one day investigated and followed her to the hermitage, but surprisingly he found neither his daughter nor the hermit there. Suddenly he {{was said to have}} heard a voice which informed <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> suspicions were ill-founded, admonishing him and informing <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> daughter had been taken away from him permanently as a punishment for his lack of trust in her morals. The King, fully chastened, sought redemption for his sin by expanding the hermitage into a temple, named in his daughter’s honour and built a city around the temple. Today this temple, called the Champavati Temple, belongs to the Royal family and the King’s daughter is venerated as a goddess. Every year, since 935, the Minjar festival or fair has been held. It lasts for 21 days, coinciding with the first day of Baisakhi.|$|E
5|$|After a long siege, Andi Guru and Tiku's former {{lieutenant}} Tandi Bunna'– both by {{then working}} for the Dutch– approached Tiku on 26 October and offered a cease fire. Although initially unwilling, Tiku was reportedly convinced by civilians who reminded <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> mother– {{who had died in}} the siege– needed to be buried. After three days of peaceful intermingling, on the night of 30 October the Dutch forces took over the fortress, appropriated all weapons, and captured Tiku. He and his soldiers were forced to go to Tondon.|$|E
5|$|Bob Bishop confronts Noah Bennet (Jack Coleman), telling <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> {{daughter}} Claire Bennet (Hayden Panettiere) {{is trying}} to expose The Company {{and that they will}} have to take drastic measures. Claire is packing up her father's files, when her boyfriend West Rosen arrives to try and stop her from revealing his secret. Angered, she gives him his file and breaks up with him. Noah returns home and tells Claire not to expose The Company, informing her that he has made a deal. He will work for them and in exchange his family will be left alone to lead normal lives.|$|E
5000|$|In Fate/Grand Order he {{is portrayed}} as a spy for Morgan who grew to be truly loyal to King Arthur. He is a {{misogynist}} due to how Morgan treated <b>him,</b> unaware <b>that</b> <b>his</b> king is also a woman. It is stated that he kept the Round Table united in their dislike of <b>him,</b> and <b>that</b> <b>his</b> death {{marked the beginning of}} Camelot's fall.|$|R

5|$|Louis XVIII {{was forced}} {{once again to}} leave Jelgava when Alexander of Russia {{informed}} <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> safety could not be guaranteed on continental Europe. In July 1807, Louis boarded a Swedish frigate to Stockholm, bringing with him only the Duke of Angoulême. Louis did not stay in Sweden for long; he arrived in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, England, in November 1807. He took up residence in Gosfield Hall, leased {{to him by the}} Marquess of Buckingham.|$|E
5|$|On 16 November 1936, Edward invited British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin to Buckingham Palace and {{expressed}} {{his desire to}} marry Wallis Simpson when she became free to remarry. Baldwin informed <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> subjects would deem the marriage morally unacceptable, largely because remarriage after divorce was opposed by the Church of England, and the people would not tolerate Simpson as queen. As king, Edward was the titular head of the Church of England, and the clergy expected him to support the Church's teachings.|$|E
5|$|On November 22, 1963, Kennedy was {{presiding}} over the Senate—a task given to junior members—when an aide rushed in to tell <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> brother, President John F. Kennedy, had been shot. His brother Robert soon {{told him that the}} President was dead. Ted and his sister Eunice Kennedy Shriver immediately flew to the family home in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, to give the news to their invalid father, who had been afflicted by a stroke suffered two years earlier.|$|E

5|$|Scully {{introduces}} Mulder to Kritschgau, {{who claims}} that everything Mulder {{thinks he knows}} about aliens is a lie. He tells <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> sister's abduction was fabricated, that all evidence of alien biology are merely scientific anomalies, and that the alien body he has just examined was fake. Kritschgau claims that the entire alien mythos is a hoax perpetrated by the U.S. government as a cover for {{the activities of the}} military–industrial complex. Mulder dismisses these claims until Scully tells him Kritschgau told her that she was given cancer to make him believe.|$|E
5|$|Sue's cheer squad loses at Regionals for {{the first}} time in seven years, and she is named Loser of the Year in a {{televised}} interview with Katie Couric. Furthering her ire, the cheerleading budget is slashed due to the cannon being seen as endangering the lives of children. The money is then handed over to the glee club so they can pay to go to regionals. Karofsky dismisses Finn's suggestion that he join the glee club permanently. Finally, Quinn kisses Finn, telling <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> actions have reminded her of why she loved him.|$|E
5|$|The man {{who will}} become the Joker is an unnamed {{engineer}} who quits his job at a chemical company to become a stand-up comedian, only to fail miserably. Desperate to support his pregnant wife Jeannie, he agrees to guide two criminals through the chemical plant where he previously worked {{so that they can}} rob the playing card company next to it. During the planning, the police inform <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> wife has died in a household accident. Grief-stricken, the engineer tries to withdraw from the plan, but the criminals strong-arm him into keeping his commitment to them.|$|E

5|$|Tom later {{searches}} Black's office, stealing his gun {{and finding}} Green's name and address. Tom confronts Green at his home, demanding to know where his wife is. The police, who have been watching Green's house, intervene and take Tom home before anyone is harmed. Black apologizes for keeping information from Tom, but warns <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> outburst is exactly why he did so. Watts has meanwhile tracked forensic evidence from the abandoned car to a cabin in the woods; blood found there matches both Green and Helen, and a ring is discovered which is identified as Helen's wedding ring.|$|E
5|$|Wyatt {{said that}} he saw Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury in Spangenberger's gun and {{hardware}} store on 4th Street filling their gun belts with cartridges. Ike testified afterward that Tom was not there {{and that he had}} tried to buy a new revolver but the owner saw Ike's bandaged head and refused to sell him one. Ike apparently had not heard Virgil tell <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> confiscated weapons were at the Grand Hotel around the corner from Spangenberger's shop.|$|E
5|$|At Moe's Tavern, Moe informs Homer and {{his friends}} {{that one of them}} must be a {{designated}} driver, and Barney loses the choosing draw. After Barney drives the drunken men home in Homer's car, Homer allows him to use it to drive himself home, expecting Barney to return it the following morning. In his distressed state, Barney disappears with the car. Two months later, Barney returns to Moe's Tavern, unable to recall where he left the car. Homer later receives a letter from the New York City government, which informs <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> car has been found parked in the World Trade Center plaza. Homer reveals to the family that he had once been to New York before when he was 17 years old and had a horrible experience. Marge and the children persuade Homer to go retrieve the car and he reluctantly agrees.|$|E
60|$|Jacques, {{standing}} behind <b>him,</b> perceived <b>that</b> <b>his</b> hair, although now in some disorder, bore signs {{of having been}} carefully dressed.

Then he found himself dismissed abruptly by a gesture.|$|R

5|$|Based on {{his play}} during {{the high school}} {{basketball}} season, AAU tournaments and national summer camps, experts from ESPN RISE, ESPN College Basketball Recruiting and other talent evaluators selected him to the August 2010 Boost Mobile Elite 24 event. By {{the time of the}} event, he was the fourth ranked basketball player in the ESPNU 100. Following his tournament play, ESPN HS began comparisons with him to Kevin Durant. At the event, his pass to Bello during the slam dunk contest appeared on SportsCenter. The following week, he played at the UIC Pavilion in the fourth annual adidas Nations global experience with many of the world's elite high school players. In the September 2010 ScoutsFocus Elite 80 All Star Game in Greensboro, North Carolina, after fans heckled <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> team was trailing, he rattled off 18 consecutive points.|$|E
5|$|Bradman {{arranged}} for Lindwall {{to see his}} Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, who restored the paceman’s leg to prime condition in a fortnight. On the public relations front, Bradman stated his firm belief in the fairness of Lindwall's delivery. During the lengthy sea voyage to England, Bradman {{emphasized the importance of}} caution with respect to his bowling action. Bradman advised Lindwall to ensure that his dragging rear right foot was further behind the line than usual to avoid being no-balled, and to refrain from bowling at full speed until the umpires were satisfied with his delivery stride. The Australian captain guaranteed Lindwall selection for the Tests and told <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> first priority in the lead-in tour matches was passing the umpires' scrutiny. Bradman recalled how paceman Ernie McCormick had been no-balled 35 times in the traditional tour opener against Worcester during the 1938 campaign, destroying his confidence {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|By 1770, Sabrina {{began to}} {{question}} Day's techniques and {{to complain about the}} chores she had to perform. In December, the propriety of Day's arrangement with Sabrina was questioned by the local community, especially Anna Seward. Edgeworth joined Day for Christmas at Stowe, and convinced <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> experiment had been unsuccessful. He also persuaded Day that Sabrina was too old to live with him without a chaperone. Day appeared to accept Edgeworth's point of view, as he paid for Sabrina to attend Sutton Coldfield boarding school in Warwickshire early in 1771. She remained at the boarding school for three years, including weekends and holidays, with infrequent visits from Day. The school normally focused on preparing high society daughters for marriage, with subjects such as needlework and the arts. Day stipulated that she was to be taught academic subjects but should not dance or learn music.|$|E
