40|$|AbstractWe {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} signaling through CD 28 family molecules on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) replication in vitro. A monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for inducible costimulator (ICOS) suppressed both X 4 and R 5 HIV- 1 replication in CD 4 + {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC). This suppression was not attributable to reduced cell growth or viability. CD 28 mAb showed variable effects and also suppressed HIV- 1 replication when immobilized. Replication of pseudotype viruses with HIV- 1 -but not with vesicular stomatitis virus G-envelope was efficiently suppressed in CD 4 + PBMC treated with ICOS or CD 28 mAbs. However, CD 4, CXCR 4, and CCR 5 expression on the surface was not down-regulated. Moreover, HIV- 1 replication in CD 4 + PBMC was suppressed by a soluble form of human B 7 -H 2, a ligand of ICOS, but was enhanced by soluble B 7 - 1, a ligand for CD 28. These findings suggest that natural or artificial ligands for ICOS potentially suppress HIV- 1 replication mainly at the <b>entry</b> <b>stages...</b>|$|R
40|$|Poly(styrene 4 -sulfonate), {{cellulose}} sulfate, polymethylenehydroquinone, and PRO 2000 are sulfated or sulfonated polymers (SPs) {{under development}} as topical microbicides. They are presumed {{to work through}} similar mechanisms of action, although to date {{there has been no}} extensive comparison of their anti-human immunodeficiency virus activities. To determine whether any of these candidate microbicides offers a potential advantage, their in vitro activities, mechanisms of action, stabilities in biological secretions, and toxicities were compared. All four compounds were found to be active against X 4, R 5, and dualtropic primary isolates and against X 4 and R 5 laboratory-adapted strains in CD 4 + T cells, macrophages, and single-coreceptor cell lines. Our single-cycle experiments using pseudotyped virus suggest that all four SPs function at the binding and <b>entry</b> <b>stages</b> of the viral life cycle but differ in degree of postentry effect. Surface plasmon resonance analyses demonstrate that SPs bind to X 4 and R 5 monomeric glycoprotein 120 with similar high binding affinities.

In this study, {{for the first time}} we show that BoHV- 1 infection manipulated phospholipase C (PLC) signaling, as demonstrated by the activation of PLCγ- 1 at both early stages [at 0. 5  h post-infection (hpi) ] and late stages (4 – 12  hpi) during the virus infection of MDBK cells. Viral entry, and de novo protein expression and/or DNA replication were potentially responsible for the activation of PLCγ- 1 signaling. PLC signaling inhibitors of both U 73122 and edelfosine significantly inhibited BoHV- 1 replication in both bovine kidney cells (MDBK) and rabbit skin cells (RS- 1) in a dose-dependent manner by affecting the virus <b>entry</b> <b>stage(s).</b> In addition, the activation of Erk 1 / 2 and p 38 MAPK signaling, and the enhanced generation of ROS by BoHV- 1 infection were obviously ameliorated by chemical inhibition of PLC signaling, implying the requirement of PLC signaling in ROS production and these MAPK pathway activation. These results suggest that the activation of PLC signaling is a potential pathogenic mechanism for BoHV- 1 infection...|$|R

The Irish Coolmore Stud organisation was represented by two runners from the Aidan O'Brien stable: Highland Reel was a proven international campaigner, having won the Secretariat Stakes and the Hong Kong Vase, whilst Sir Isaac Newton had won the International Stakes at the Curragh on his last start. France's representative Erupt had won the Grand Prix de Paris in 2015 and finished second in the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud on his most recent appearance. The only three-year-old in the race was Wings of Desire who had won the Dante Stakes before finishing fourth in the 2016 Epsom Derby.

40|$|Workload control (WLC) is a {{production}} planning and control (PPC) concept designed for complex manufacturing environments, with particular relevance to make-to-order (MTO) companies and small and {{medium sized enterprises}} (SMEs). Despite receiving much attention in the literature, few successful implementations have been reported. Moreover, a lack of awareness regarding WLC in industry affects the support it receives from employees within a company and, if implemented, it is sometimes misused or neglected. This article presents a new interactive WLC training and implementation tool developed within a WLC decision support system (DSS) which uses simulation to generate the incoming order stream at the customer enquiry and job <b>entry</b> <b>stages</b> and to mirror the throughput time variability {{on the shop floor}} of real-life manufacturing environments. This provides an action-learning package for end-users in order to improve understanding of the concept and generate support prior to implementation. In particular, the tool provides training and decision-making experience in: parameter setting; due date setting; the acceptance/rejection of jobs; scheduling intervention; order release decisions; and capacity management. This article reports on the application of the tool as part of a strategy to implement WLC in a small subcontract MTO company. Among other results, use of the tool: improved understanding of WLC; highlighted gaps between current business processes and those supported by WLC; and led to rethinking the choice of end-user for the DSS...|$|R
40|$|Only {{a subset}} of {{patients}} who enter stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD) progress to stage 4. Identifying which patients entering stage 3 {{are most likely to}} progress could improve outcomes, by allowing more appropriate referrals for specialist care, and spare those unlikely to progress the adverse effects and costliness of an unnecessarily aggressive approach. We hypothesized that compared to non-progressors, patients who enter stage 3 CKD and ultimately progress have experienced greater loss of renal function, manifested by impairment of metabolic function (anemia, worsening acidosis and mineral abnormalities), than is reflected in the eGFR at <b>entry</b> to <b>stage</b> 3. The purpose of this case-controlled study was to design a prediction model for CKD progression using laboratory values reflecting metabolic status. Using data extracted from the electronic health record (EHR), two cohorts of patients in stage 3 were identified: progressors (eGFR declined > 3 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2 /year; n = 117) and non-progressors (eGFR declined < 1 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2; n = 364). Initial laboratory values recorded a year before to a year after the time of <b>entry</b> to <b>stage</b> 3, reflecting metabolic complications (hemoglobin, bicarbonate, calcium, phosphorous, and albumin) were obtained. Average values in progressors and non-progressors were compared. Classification algorithms (Naïve Bayes and Logistic Regression) were used to develop prediction models of progression based on the initial lab data. At the <b>entry</b> to <b>stage</b> 3 CKD, hemoglobin, bicarbonate, calcium, and albumin values were significantly lower and phosphate values significantly higher in progressors compared to non-progressors even though initial eGFR values were similar. The differences were sufficiently large that a prediction model of progression could be developed based on these values. Post-test probability of progression in patients classified as progressors or non-progressors were 81 % (73 %[*]−[*] 86 %) and 17 % (13 %[*]−[*] 23 %), respectively. Our studies demonstrate that patients who enter stage 3 and ultimately progress to stage 4 manifest a greater degree of metabolic complications than those who remain stable at the onset of stage 3 when eGFR values are equivalent. Lab values (hemoglobin, bicarbonate, phosphorous, calcium and albumin) are sufficiently different between the two cohorts that a reasonably accurate predictive model can be developed...|$|R
