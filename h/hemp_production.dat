25|$|Cannabis sativa L. subsp. sativa var. sativa is {{the variety}} grown for {{industrial}} use, while C. sativa subsp. indica generally has poor fiber quality and female buds from this variety are primarily used for recreational and medicinal purposes. The major {{differences between the}} two types of plants are the appearance, and the amount of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) secreted in a resinous mixture by epidermal hairs called glandular trichomes, although they can also be distinguished genetically. Oilseed and fiber varieties of Cannabis approved for industrial <b>hemp</b> <b>production</b> produce only minute amounts of this psychoactive drug, not enough for any physical or psychological effects. Typically, hemp contains below 0.3% THC, while cultivars of Cannabis grown for medicinal or recreational use can contain anywhere from 2% to over 20%.|$|E

50|$|Hemp juice {{made from}} {{industrial}} hemp is a drug-free, non-psychoactive juice pressed with {{pressure from the}} Cannabis sativa plant. The juice is obtained through a large-scale industrial cold-pressing procedure using the upper parts of the hemp plant {{as well as the}} leaves. This procedure clearly distinguishes hemp juice from other hemp products such as hemp oil, hemp sprouts or hemp milk, which are solely obtained through the seeds of the hemp plant as opposed to the green hemp leaves used for the juice. The <b>hemp</b> juice <b>production</b> therefore makes use of a valuable part of the industrial hemp plant which has previously been neglected and not been used but instead been left on the fields to decompose. In particular, hemp juice offers a base for a variety of drug-free products in the areas of nutrition, medicine, cosmetics, and relaxing beverages. Moreover, its full-bodied umami flavor offers the ability to enhance dishes and drinks in their specific flavor, especially sweet or savory and harmonizes tastes overall.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{complexity}} of the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method requires many subjective choices throughout the procedure, which make decision making difficult and LCA results insecure. Our approach consists in combining life cycle thinking and sensitivity analysis to provide information to the actor of a foreground system within a product's life cycle. For any parameter of a foreground system, the trends and quantified influence on impact categories are systematically compared to determine the most effective action levers for actors controlling the process. This approach has been previously applied to a single actor, the farmer, in {{a case study of}} <b>hemp</b> crop <b>production.</b> In this study, we introduce a second life cycle actor: the industrial producer for transformation of hemp straw into insulation products for buildings. The relationships between farming and industrial actors are examined and demonstrate that industrial actors have action levers limited to climate change and energy consumption.

40|$|Sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea L.) is a {{tropical}} legume that produces plant biomass and nitrogen (N) quickly. Our objectives were {{to assess the}} growth of a new sunn hemp cultivar breed to produce seed in a temperate climate and determine the residual N effect on a rye (Secale cereale L.) cover crop in east-central Alabama from 2007 to 2009. Plant populations, plant height, stem diameter, biomass production, and N content were determined for two sunn hemp planting dates, following corn (Zea mays L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) harvest, across different seeding rates (17, 34, 50, and 67 [*]kg/ha). Rye biomass was measured the following spring. Sunn <b>hemp</b> biomass <b>production</b> was inconsistent across planting dates, but did relate to growing degree accumulation. Nitrogen concentrations were inversely related to biomass production, and subsequent N contents corresponded to biomass levels. Neither planting date nor seeding rate affected rye biomass production, but rye biomass averaged over both planting dates following wheat/sunn hemp averaged 43 % and 33 % greater than rye following fallow. Rye biomass following corn/sunn hemp was equivalent to fallow plots.

25|$|Currently {{there is}} a small niche market for hemp pulp, for example as {{cigarette}} paper. Hemp fiber is mixed with fiber from other sources than hemp. In 1994 there was no significant production of 100% true hemp paper. World <b>hemp</b> pulp <b>production</b> was believed to be around 120,000 tons per year in 1991 which was about 0.05% of the world's annual pulp production volume. The total world <b>production</b> of <b>hemp</b> fiber had in 2003 declined to about 60,000 from 80,000 tons. This can be compared to a typical pulp mill for wood fiber, which is never smaller than 250,000 tons per annum. The cost of hemp pulp is approximately six times that of wood pulp, mostly because of the small size and outdated equipment of the few hemp processing plants in the Western world, and because hemp is harvested once a year (during August) and needs to be stored to feed the mill the whole year through. This storage requires a lot of (mostly manual) handling of the bulky stalk bundles. Another issue is that the entire hemp plant cannot be economically prepared for paper production. While the wood products industry uses nearly 100% of the fiber from harvested trees, only about 25% of the dried hemp stem—the bark, called bast—contains the long, strong fibers desirable for paper production. All this accounts for a high raw material cost. Hemp pulp is bleached with hydrogen peroxide, a process today also commonly used for wood pulp.|$|R

Exper-imentally the GPDs can be accessed in exclusive measurements such as Hard Exclusive Meson (; :::) <b>Production</b> (<b>HEMP)</b> and Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS). The latter reaction is the simplest from the theoretical point of view but also the most difficult experimentally because one has to select per-fectly the final state (one lepton, one proton and one photon) among all the possible reactions.
