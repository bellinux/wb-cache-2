5|$|US-64 and SH-51 proceed {{southeast}} {{from downtown}} along another freeway, the Broken Arrow Expressway. Between Lewis Avenue and Sheridan Road, a rail line {{runs down the}} median of the highway. After the freeway splits away from the railroad alignment, it comes to an interchange with I-44/ SH-66. From here, the Broken Arrow Expressway heads southeast to an interchange with the Mingo Valley Expressway, which carries US-169. Here, US-64 splits away to follow the southbound Mingo Valley Expressway, while SH-51 continues southeast on the Broken Arrow Expressway. US-64/ US-169 follow a due south course to an interchange with the Creek Turnpike. The freeway merges with a <b>free</b> <b>section</b> of the turnpike, heading west. At an interchange with Memorial Drive, US-64 turns south, splitting away from the freeway. US-169 ends at this point, and tolls resume on the Creek Turnpike {{to the west of}} the interchange.|$|E
25|$|The longest <b>free</b> <b>section</b> of main lanes is on {{the north}} side of Houston, {{stretching}} from Ella Boulevard east to Mesa Dr. This is maintained by the Texas Department of Transportation east of roughly the Hardy Toll Road interchange. This particular <b>free</b> <b>section</b> has remained untolled since its 1969 opening because of accessibility to George Bush Intercontinental Airport. It includes the interchanges with I-69/US 59, the Hardy Toll Road, and Interstate Highway 45 (North Freeway).|$|E
25|$|On 4 August 2006 Kennedy {{hosted a}} {{documentary}} on Channel 4 about {{what he saw as}} the increasing disenchantment felt by voters towards the main parties in British politics because of their hesitation to discuss the big issues, especially at election time, and the ruthless targeting of swing-voters in key constituencies {{at the expense of the}} majority.

50|$|In {{addition}} to the preludial and expositional themes, the exposition typically contains various <b>free</b> <b>sections</b> that show off the piano; but, contrary to the popular conception of the piano concerto, and to how it developed in the nineteenth century, these sections are not merely empty displays, but rather, short sections that fit into the overall scheme.|$|R
25|$|As an {{alternative}} {{location for the}} airport to serve Sogn, Høyanger was considered and test flights were flown there. Also Gaupne was considered by an industrial conglomerate led by Aker, although also these plans were shelved. Haukåsen was therefore selected {{as the site of}} the airport. Mayor of Sogndal, Nils Knagenhjelm, offered a <b>free</b> <b>section</b> of land at Haukåsen if the airport was located there. He had built a road to the area in the 1960s. The terms were accepted and the land and the road were taken over by the airport {{at the time of the}} aerodrome's completion.|$|E

The Creek Turnpike's western terminus is at the Turner Turnpike in Sapulpa, while its northeastern terminus is at the Will Rogers Turnpike in Fair Oaks; both ends of the Creek Turnpike connect with Interstate 44 (I-44). Along the way, the highway passes through the cities of Sapulpa, Jenks, Tulsa, and Broken Arrow, and the counties of Creek, Tulsa, Wagoner and Rogers. The road is maintained by the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority (OTA), except for a brief <b>free</b> <b>section</b> shared with U.S. Route 64 (US-64) and US-169.

The Guardian also had a number of talkboards that were noted for their mix of political discussion and whimsy, until they were closed on Friday, 25 February 2011.

6000|$|My case is typical. For {{three or}} four days before my first ordeal, I could not eat. A mysterious uneasiness {{developed}} in my solar plexus, a pain which never left me--except possibly in the morning before I had time to think. Day by day I drilled and drilled and drilled, out in the fields {{at the edge of the}} town or at home when mother was away, in the barn while milking--at every opportunity I went through my selection with most impassioned voice and lofty gestures, sustained by the legends of Webster and Demosthenes, resolved upon a blazing victory. I did everything but mumble a smooth pebble--realizing that most of the boys in my section were going through precisely the same struggle. Each of us knew exactly how the others felt, and yet I cannot say that we displayed acute sympathy one with another; on the contrary, those in the <b>free</b> <b>section</b> considered the antics of the suffering section a very amusing spectacle and we were continually being [...] "joshed" [...] about our lack of appetite.|$|E

50|$|In 1979 the new {{deliveries}} of the Hitachi fleet were {{catching up}} with the Tait numbering block, so some carriages were renumbered into <b>free</b> <b>sections</b> of the roster. This started with the gap 462M-469M and 474M-499M, and later cars took numbers of Tait motor cars previously scrapped. By 1983 deliveries of the Comeng fleet made even this measure insufficient, so the 19x remaining Motors simply had a 1 prefix added to their numbers, i.e. 383M became 1383M.|$|R
