5|$|Despite {{releasing}} the PC version, Virgin {{was not interested}} in publishing the <b>game</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> PlayStation, feeling that only 3D games would sell for the console. As a result, Cecil contacted Sony Computer Entertainment, who agreed to release the game for the console. In North America, Broken Sword was renamed to Circle of Blood. Cecil was uneasy about the name change, feeling that it gave a wrong impression of what type of game it was. In 1998 however, THQ published the <b>game</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> PlayStation platform under its original Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars title.|$|E

It is the first game to have built-in enhancement for the Super Game Boy accessory. The arcade version makes an appearance in Donkey Kong 64 in the Frantic Factory level.|$|E

50|$|The PAL {{versions}} of all 3D Classics <b>games</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Nintendo 3DS except Xevious and TwinBee run much smoother at 60 Hz unlike the Wii's Virtual Console versions which only run at 50 Hz, mainly {{due to the}} fact the 3DS versions are semi-modified ports of their original NES and arcade versions.

5|$|Chu {{made his}} debut as a {{contestant}} on the January 28, 2014, episode of Jeopardy!, winning $37,200 {{in his first}} <b>game.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> January 29 episode, Chu made a Final Jeopardy! wager that caused him to tie fellow contestant Carolyn Collins. Chu claimed that he {{made the decision to}} wager for a tie not out of kindness but because of the advice of 2003 College champion Keith Williams, who claims that game theory favors wagering for a tie over the more common practice of wagering to win by a dollar. Chu defeated Collins on the January 30 episode.|$|E
5|$|Clemson {{received}} Georgia Tech's kickoff with 1:20 {{remaining in}} the <b>game.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> Tigers' first play, they committed a 10-yard penalty. Two incomplete passes followed from Parker, who then completed an 18-yard throw to Xavier Dye. This set up a fourth-and-two for the Tigers, who needed to gain a first down to keep their potential game-winning drive going. Instead, Parker was stymied {{in his attempt to}} run for the needed yards, and Clemson turned the ball over on downs. Georgia Tech's offense ran out the remaining seconds on the clock and ensured their 39–34 victory.|$|E

5|$|Clemson's {{defense was}} strongest against the rush. During the regular season, the Tigers allowed {{an average of}} 101.8 yards per <b>game</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground, good enough for No. 18 nationally.

On average, the Tigers allowed 238.6 yards per game through the air, making their pass defense the 97th best in {{division}} I-A football during the regular season. With both categories combined, the defense was ranked No. 37. In terms of points allowed, rather than yardage, the Tigers were ranked No. 23 after giving up an average of 19.3 yards per game.|$|E
5|$|During {{its first}} week of sales in the United Kingdom Batman: Arkham Origins was the number-one-selling game on all {{available}} formats, topping the all-format chart.

5|$|Evidence of {{large-scale}} Mesolithic nut processing, radiocarbon dated to circa 7000BC, {{has been found}} in a midden pit at Staosnaig on Colonsay. The dig discovered the remains {{of hundreds of thousands of}} burned hazelnut shells and gives an insight into communal activity and forward planning in the period. The nuts were harvested in a single year and pollen analysis suggests that the hazel trees were all cut down at the same time. The scale of the activity, unparalleled elsewhere in Scotland, and the lack of large <b>game</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island, suggests the possibility that Colonsay contained a community with a largely vegetarian diet for the time they spent on the island.|$|E

5|$|For {{the next}} Bungie title, 1993's Pathways Into Darkness, Seropian hired a third team member for {{graphics}} work. The game {{was the first}} three-dimensional texture-mapped <b>game</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Mac and the first true first-person shooter. By 1994 Bungie had grown to a staff of six and had moved into a rundown Chicago office—a converted former religious school located {{in front of a}} crack house. Their next title, Marathon, began development as a sequel to Pathways but grew larger. On release it won several awards and established Bungie as the top Mac game developer.|$|E

Appearances in other competitions were more common due to Rafael Benítez's squad rotation policy. On 25 October 2006 Fowler was named as Liverpool's captain {{for the first time since}} his return in a League Cup tie against Reading, scoring just before half-time in a 4–3 win.|$|E
