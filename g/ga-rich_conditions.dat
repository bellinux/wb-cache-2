40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to design semiconductor material structures for a number of different devices, including GaN metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM), InGaAs/InAlAs MSM, and InAs/GaAs quantum dot photodetectors, and to study the growth conditions for epitaxial material using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) augmented with an rf-plasma nitrogen source. GaN was grown on a LiGaO 2 substrate, which has multiple advantages over the most commonly used substrates for III-nitride growth. LiGaO 2 substrates have a small lattice mismatch of approximately 1 % with GaN, which leads to high-quality epitaxy film by optimization of the growth condition. The combination of nitridation, buffer, super lattice, and <b>Ga-rich</b> <b>condition</b> is the key to improving the quality of GaN film grown by MBE on LiGaO 2. The first GaN MSM grown on LiGaO 2 was reported, which has the dark current in the range of 10 - 12 A. The device was then lift off and bonded on SiO 2 /Si wafer. The performance of the device did not degrade after integration. However, the orthorhombic crystal structure of LiGaO 2 results in the unusual asymmetric strains within GaN, causing changes in the microstructure of GaN and making integration difficult. The strains within GaN grown on LiGaO 2 were investigated using high resolution x-ray. It was found that the critical thickness of GaN on LGO was around 10 nm, and the strains relieve with film thickness increasing. The dislocation densities were also calculated and confirmed by AFM, which can be as low as 2 䥱 07 /cm 2. Through studying of the strains with the insertion of AlGaN/GaN superlattice buffer, {{it was found that the}} strain of the epitaxial layer is dependent on the thickness and critical thickness of both epitaxy and buffer layer. For thin GaN films, Al 0. 12 GaN superlattice buffer would relieve the strain most, and for the thicker layers, the Al 0. 44 GaN superlattice buffer relieves the strain most. The dislocation density measurement shows that an insertion of buffer decreases dislocations significantly. Insertion of superlattice buffers does not decrease dislocation density further. The material structure of InGaAs/InAlAs was studied. The device quality was improved by optimizing the material structure. Depends on the application as optical interconnects, the optimized material structure should insure the device with high speed but reasonable responsivity. Finally, devices were fabricated that achieve speeds as high as 50 - 70 GHz, comparable with the commercial ultra-fast MSM. The research of quantum dots was focused on modification of the size, strains, and structures of quantum dots by annealing the spacer between quantum dot layers using As 4 and P 2, respectively, at different temperatures. It was found that the annealing under P 2 results in surface exchange, and the annealing under As 4 mostly changes dots?zes, causing the changes of energy level. Ph. D.

Experimental evidence of the presence of N-vacancies was noted from electron energy loss spectroscopy measurements which further correlated with the high electrical conductivity observed in GaN nanowall network. We find that the Fermi level pins at 0. 35 $\pm$ 0. 02 eV below Ga derived surface state. Presence of atomic steps in the nanostructure due to formation of N-vacancies at the (10 $\overline{ 1 }$ 0) surface makes its electronic structure metallic. Clustering of N-vacancies and Ga-Ga metallic bond formation near these vacancies, is seen to be another source of electrical conductivity of faceted GaN nanostructure that is observed experimentally...|$|R
