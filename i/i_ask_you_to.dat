Immediately after taking the oath of office in the East Room of the White House, he spoke to the assembled audience in a speech broadcast live to the nation.

[...] Epstein then supposedly said, [...] "Would you find it embarrassing if <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> stay in a hotel overnight?" [...] Best replied {{that he was not}} interested, and the two never mentioned the incident again. There were reports of a brief sexual encounter between Lennon and Epstein during a four-day holiday in Barcelona, in April 1963. Lennon always denied the rumours, telling Playboy in 1980: [...] "Well, it was almost a love affair, but not quite. It was never consummated... but we did have a pretty intense relationship." [...] Lennon's first wife Cynthia also maintains that Lennon's relationship with Epstein was platonic. A fictionalised account of the Spanish holiday is featured in the 1991 film The Hours and Times.|$|E

[...] Frank, unwilling to eat the moldy doughnuts, buried the rest in the backyard. However, Maud, peering through the window, noticed his actions and immediately scooped them out. [...] "Dust off" [...] them, she gave one to Frank. [...] Annoyed, Frank told her he no longer wanted to eat the doughnuts because they were [...] "not fit to eat and you know it".

2500|$|... “The {{ministry}} {{is not like}} the Senate. The {{ministry is}} not a Congress for anyone {{to come here to}} express his opinion. The ministry has no capacity for that.

All the saints who have left the denominations, the divisive sects, and stand on the proper ground are a local church in their locality. They can express their opinions, but they may {{have nothing to do with}} this ministry... This does not mean that <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> stay away from your local church or that your local church is no longer a local church... I am not talking about the churches, I am talking about the ministry. The ministry is one thing, and the churches are another thing. These two things can be differentiated in the Epistles written by Paul. Paul’s ministry is one category, and the churches are another category. Paul never tried to force all the churches to follow him in his ministry, but Paul surely had a ministry for the churches.” ...|$|E

Speechmaking is a new thing to me, you must therefore please excuse my words being few.

We most earnestly desire the establishment of law, and if you will help us it can be done. We want to govern Fiji in every respect as this land is governed. I have come to white man's land to be trained at Newington College. I am anxious to be taught. You were born in the light, I in the darkness. You were born in a Christian land, I in a heathen country. I wish to be trained here that I may be of service in the government of my own country.

2500|$|Senegal {{people are}} not prosecuted for their sexual {{orientation}}. Sexual orientation in Senegal is a purely private matter. It is a private matter, nothing more. For many years now, we have seen homosexuality in our country and that has never lead to situations where homosexuals are harassed, persecuted, or prosecuted. What {{has happened is that}} there have been sutiations where shocking behavior which ran counter to our religious beliefs and morality which [...] punishes unnatural sexual relations. I would ask you to understand the social realities of our country. This is an issue which is very complex. It is a very complicated issue in Senegal. Let me say once again in Senegal homosexuals lead freely ... we even had a federal republic to authorize a homosexual to have their name changed to a woman's name in order to emphasize their feminine side. No one was shocked when the president authorized the man to adopt the woman's name. But when homosexuality becomes blatantly public, it leads to embarrassing situations. You have to understand that we are a country with a particularly tolerant form of Islam. And that is why we must avoid, we must avoid the development of fundamentalism. We must ensure social cohesion. We must also take measures to protect the lives of homosexuals. That is why <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> bear in mind our society, our sociological realities. This is a perfectly complicated issue for us where there are some problems but we are aware of them. ... I would like {{to go back to a}} very important issue. We are all struggling for the independence of our judges, for the independence of our justice system. If the courts hand down a decision, you cannot say the government is responsible for that court decision. The ... independent justice system which hands down a decision. And that is what the courts did in the case of the trials of these homosexuals. And I must say ... for 25 years I was a lawyer at the bar. I know the Senegalese justice system from the inside. ... Over those years there have been three cases where homosexuals were brought before the courts. The first case was an organized homosexual marriage with a lot of fuss, a lot of publicity. The police arrested them and the court case led to an acquittal. The second case of homosexuals related to a foreign national who was already rather elderly who married a young Senegalese boy. And I would like to warn you ... that if an elderly man marries a young boy, the young boy does it so that he can emigrate and go in live in France or some other country abroad, that is the interest of the young person in getting married. This led to a conviction and an appeal was made against the conviction and ... the foreigner was able to leave the country after they were acquitted on appeal. And the third case ... is the case of homosexuals who joined together again with a great deal of fuss, carried out activities which led to disturbances in the neighborhood. The neighbors complained and the police acted. This has already been tried in the first instance, and an appeal has been made against that judgment, and the justice system is now dealing with this case independently on appeal.|$|E
