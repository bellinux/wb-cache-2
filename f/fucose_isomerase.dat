40|$|L- 1, 2 -Propanediol is an irretrievable {{end product}} of L-fucose {{fermentation}} by Escherichia coli. Selection for increased aerobic growth rate on propanediol {{results in the}} escalation of basal synthesis of the NAD+-linked oxidoreductase encoded by fucO, {{a member of the}} fuc regulon for the utilization of L-fucose. In general, when fucO becomes constitutively expressed, two other simultaneous changes occur: the fucA gene encoding fuculose- 1 -phosphate aldolase becomes constitutively expressed and the fucPIK operon encoding fucose permease, <b>fucose</b> <b>isomerase,</b> and fuculose kinase becomes noninducible. In the present study, we show that fucO and fucA form an operon which is divergently transcribed from the adjacent fucPIK operon. In propanediol-positive and fucose-negative mutants the cis-controlling region shared by the operons fucAO and fucPIK is lengthened by 1. 2 kilobases. DNA hybridization identified the insertion element to be IS 5. This element, always oriented in the same direction with the left end (the BglII end) proximal to fucA, apparently causes constitutive expression of fucAO and noninducibility of fucPIK. The DNA of the fucAO operon and a part of the adjacent fucP was sequenced...|$|E
40|$|Wild-type {{strains of}} Escherichia coli {{are unable to}} use L- 1, 2 -propanediol as a carbon and energy source. Strain 3, a mutant {{selected}} for the ability to grow on this compound at progressively more rapid rates, synthesizes constitutively a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-linked propanediol oxidoreductase. This enzyme is normally synthesized during anaerobic growth on L-fucose when it functions as a lactaldehyde reductase. Propanediol, the end product of this fermentation process, escapes irretrievably into the medium. The propanediol-utilizing mutant can no longer grow on fucose in either {{the presence or absence}} of molecular oxygen. In the present study nine independent lines of propanediol-positive mutants were characterized. One mutant, strain 418, attained a propanediol growth rate close to that of strain 3 without loss of the ability to grow on fucose. In all cases examined, however, prolonged selection on propanediol did result in the emergence of fucose-negative mutants. All of these mutants had enzyme patterns similar to that of strain 3; namely, fucose permease, <b>fucose</b> <b>isomerase,</b> and fuculose kinase were noninducible, whereas fuculose 1 -phosphate aldolase was constitutive. In strain 418 and in the fucose-positive predecessors of the other mutants, the first four enzymes in the pathway remained inducible, as in the wild-type strain. Improvements in the growth rate on propanediol appeared to reflect principally the increased activity level of the oxidoreductase during the early stages of evolution. According to transductional analysis, the mutations affecting the ability to grow on propanediol and those that affect the expression of the first enzymes in the fucose pathway were very closely linked. The loss of the ability to grow on fucose is thought to be a mechanistic consequence incidental to the remodeling of the regulatory system in favor of the utilization of the novel carbon source...|$|E
