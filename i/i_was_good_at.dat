500|$|Gallagher {{began to}} suffer drug-induced panic attacks during this period. His {{depression}} and paranoid well-being inspired the song [...] "Gas Panic!", subsequently {{included on the}} 2000 album Standing on the Shoulder of Giants. He claimed to have quit using illicit drugs on 5 June 1998. Gallagher stated in 2001, [...] "I liked drugs, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> them. But I'd had panic attacks {{for about a year}} and I stopped because [...] I wanted to. After you make the decision, it is quite easy." [...] Between 1993 and 1998, Gallagher claims, [...] "I can hardly remember a thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Fonda became {{interested}} in acting in 1954, while appearing with her father in a charity performance of The Country Girl, at the Omaha Community Playhouse. After dropping out of Vassar, she went to Paris for two years to study art. Upon returning to the states, in 1958, she met Lee Strasberg and the meeting {{changed the course of}} her life, Fonda saying, [...] "I went to the Actors Studio and Lee Strasberg told me I had talent. Real talent. It {{was the first time that}} anyone, except my father – who had to say so – told me <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>good.</b> <b>At</b> anything. It was a turning point in my life. I went to bed thinking about acting. I woke up thinking about acting. It was like the roof had come off my life!" ...|$|E
500|$|After leaving {{school at}} 16, {{he decided to}} be a painter and began {{training}} in commercial illustration at Saint Martin's School of Art. While attending a rehearsal for a workshop at the Oval House, a fire eater was teaching people how to eat fire {{and he decided to}} join. A circus agent saw him busking and hired him for three years. He later trained for three years as an actor at the Drama Centre London. Brosnan has described the feeling of becoming an actor and the impact it had on his life: [...] "When I found acting, or when acting found me, it was a liberation. It was a stepping stone into another life, away from a life that I had, and acting was something <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>at,</b> something which was appreciated. That was a great satisfaction in my life." ...|$|E
50|$|Another {{struggling}} minority {{student in}} Japan, a Peruvian sixth-grader, tells Vaipae: {{in my country}} I had a good life... everything goes as I like, for instance, soccer, volleyball, swimming, running, talking and studying. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> really <b>good</b> <b>at</b> these things and I also had many friends. Now <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> nothing.|$|R
5000|$|His {{conversion}} {{took place}} as he asked God for help, praying that [...] "God would decide for me, for <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> thinking but bad at acting, like Hamlet." [...] It {{was then that}} he says he [...] "seemed to sense" [...] the call of saints and his favorite heroes, to which he assented.|$|R

2500|$|Hard rock {{musician}} Lemmy of {{the band}} Motörhead gained a lot from his tenure in Hawkwind. He has remarked, [...] "I really found myself as an instrumentalist in Hawkwind. Before that I was just a guitar player who was pretending to be good, when actually I was no good at all. In Hawkwind I became a good bass player. It was where I learned <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> something." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Many of {{you know}} me as a legendary boxer, and I'm proud of that," [...] he said. [...] "However, that journey was not always easy. When I was younger, I became a fighter because I had to survive. I had nothing. I {{had no one to}} depend on except myself. I {{realized}} that boxing was something <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>at,</b> and I trained hard so that I could keep myself and my family alive." ...|$|E
6000|$|But soon I {{found that}} there was good in her too. She used {{sometimes}} to give me pennies, so that once I had four in my pocket all at the same time; but the best part of her was the stories that she could tell. She was sore frightened of frogs, so I would bring one to her, and tell her that I would put it down her neck unless she told a story. That always helped her to begin; but when once she was started it was wonderful how she would carry on. And the things that had happened to her, they were enough to take your breath away. There was a Barbary rover that had been at Eyemouth, and he was coming back in five years in a ship full of gold to make her his wife; {{and then there was a}} wandering knight who had been there also, and he had given her a ring which he said he would redeem when the time came. She showed me the ring, which was very like the ones upon my bed curtain; but she said that this one was virgin gold. I asked her what the knight would do if he met the Barbary rover, and she told me that he would sweep his head from his shoulders. [...] What they could all see in her was more than I could think. And then she told me that she had been followed on her way to West Inch by a disguised prince. I asked her how she knew it was a prince, and she said by his disguise. Another day she said that her father was preparing a riddle, and that when it was ready it would be put in the papers, and anyone who guessed it would have half his fortune and his daughter. I said that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> riddles, and that she must send it to me when it was ready. She said it would be in the Berwick Gazette, and wanted to know what I would do with her when I won her. I said I would sell her by public roup for what she would fetch; but she would tell no more stories that evening, for she was very techy about some things.|$|E
3000|$|Creative self-efficacy was {{measured}} by three items adapted from Tiernery and Farmer(2002). Examples included [...] "I feel <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> generating novel ideas" [...] and “I have confidence in my ability to solve problems creatively.” Responses were also made on a 7 -point scale ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree.” The Cronbach’s alpha for this scale was 0.80.|$|R
6000|$|The poor Truant {{was silent}} for an instant, and then he said: [...] "That {{is not the kind}} of thing <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>good</b> <b>at,</b> but <b>I</b> expect some of the other fellows could tell you easily enough. Our windows must be all in a row, and you can climb up and ask some of them; and if any one tells you, will you get us all out?" ...|$|R

40|$|Science and {{research}} consume a substantial – {{some might say}} the greater part – of my life. It is an all-consuming passion that many fail to understand. Professionally, I divide my time between managing a substantial research programme and running what is arguably the largest science faculty in South Africa, if not the continent. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not only passionate about my research but also about sharing this passion with others, particularly young researchers, and <b>I</b> believe <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> what <b>I</b> do.

50|$|I was {{a basket}} case when I left! I'd already {{had too much}} of it. That kind of work suits some people, but it didn't suit me. It was my {{decision}} to leave and I was desperate, really desperate, to go. Because I knew <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> comedy {{and there was no}} way that Valerie Barlow was ever going to be funny.|$|E
5000|$|Gallant {{was born}} Ira Gallantz in the Bronx, New York into a Russian Jewish family. [...] He {{had a brother}} who was murdered in the 1980s. Gallant, who was openly gay, {{eventually}} began styling hair. He later admitted [...] "...I hated it styling.

30|$|You need to redo the {{analysis}} for each cell, but, this time, asking a different question: If <b>I,</b> or we, <b>were</b> to take decision 1, would that make scenario A more likely in reality? Besides answering a different {{question in the}} cell-by-cell analysis, shaping and transforming differ in another crucial detail: how you choose your preferred future. The {{way to do it}} in ‘shaping’ is a very pragmatic, almost mechanical and certainly detached manner. You pick the future in which your decisions, pending, overdue and just around the corner, lead to the biggest advantage to you. This approach originates in a good, deep and honest look at yourself - what <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>good</b> <b>at?</b> - and answers the question of how can I shape the future so that what <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> gives me an advantage over others in that future.|$|R

5000|$|King {{has complained}} about his media {{coverage}} since his conviction. In 2005 {{he went to}} the Press Complaints Commission about an article in the News of the World that said he had gone to a park to [...] "ogle" [...] boys. In fact he had gone there at the request of a documentary maker. The complaint was not upheld, but Roy Greenslade argued that King had a good case. In October 2011 then BBC Director-General Mark Thompson apologised to King for the removal of King's performance of [...] "It Only Takes a Minute" [...] from a repeat, on BBC Four, of a 1976 episode of Top of the Pops. King described the cut as a [...] "Stalinist revision approach to history". [...] When asked by a newspaper in 2012 if he believed he had anything to apologise for, to anybody from his past, King replied, [...] "The only apology I have is to say that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> seduction. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> making myself seem attractive when I wasn't very attractive at all." ...|$|E

"I liked archery because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> it and I got {{to travel}} for free, but also, when you shoot that perfect arrow {{and you see}} it hit {{the center of the}} target, there’s just {{something}} about that, you know, to keep shooting that perfect arrow. I mean, it is a thrill to shoot that perfect arrow, from whatever distance, and see it hit. Boom. That’s a good feeling. You want to keep going until you get that perfect arrow." ...|$|E
5000|$|His {{brother was}} seven years younger, {{outgoing}} and precocious, attracting attention. Marshall stood up to defend him and suffered in fights. The brothers were estranged for a 44-year interval. [...] "My brother is like my mother is like my wife Gloria. They stir things up everywhere they go. Now I love that characteristic in all of them, but..." [...] Marshall explained, [...] "I {{was in the hospital}} a lot, though from sports, violent ones that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>at,</b> probably more than fights." ...|$|E

5000|$|His stage name {{is derived}} from Khalifa, an Arabic word meaning [...] "successor", and wisdom, which was {{shortened}} to Wiz when Khalifa was a young boy. Khalifa stated to spinner.com that the name also came from being called [...] "young Wiz 'cause <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> everything I did, and my granddad is Muslim, so he gave me that name; he felt like that's what I was doing with my music."
