2500|$|In 2014 Watson {{published}} {{a paper in}} The Lancet suggesting that biological oxidants may have a different role than is thought in diseases including diabetes, dementia, <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>and</b> <b>cancer.</b> For example, type 2 diabetes is usually thought {{to be caused by}} oxidation in the body that causes inflammation and kills off pancreatic cells. Watson thinks the root of that inflammation is different: [...] "a lack of biological oxidants, not an excess", and discusses this in detail. One critical response was that the idea was neither new nor worthy of merit, and that The Lancet published Watson's paper only because of his name. However, other scientists have expressed their support for his hypothesis and have proposed that it can also be expanded to why a lack of oxidants can result in cancer and its progression.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Background: Recent {{epidemiologic}} studies {{promote the}} notion that high intake of food rich in phy-tochemicals protects against degenerative diseases such as coronary <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> <b>and</b> <b>cancer.</b> Phytochemicals are detoxified in mammalian tissues by conjugation with glucuronic acid yielding less active glucuronide conju-gates. However, in several tissues glucuronide conjugates are reactivated by the cleaving enzyme &beta;-glucuronidase. The aim {{of the present study}} was to develop a routinely manageable, rapid technique to localize the &beta;-glucuroni-dase activity in the small intestinal tissue. Methods: His-tologic slices of rat duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were incubated with a specific chromogenic &beta;-glucuroni-dase substrate, 5 -bromo- 4 -chloro- 3 -indolyl-&beta;-D-glucuro-nide (X-GlcU).

2500|$|Studies on {{the health}} effects of {{vegetarian}} diets observe heterogeneous effects on mortality. One review found a decreased overall risk of all cause mortality, cancer (except breast) and cardiovascular disease; however, a meta-analysis found lower risk for ischemic <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>and</b> <b>cancer</b> but no effect on overall mortality or cerebrovascular disease. Possible limitations include varying definitions used of vegetarianism, and the observation of increased risk of lung cancer mortality in those on a vegetarian diet for less than five years. An analysis pooling two large studies found vegetarians in the UK have similar all cause mortality as meat eaters. [...] An older meta analysis found similar results, only finding decreased mortality in vegetarians, pescatarians, and irregular meat eaters in ischemic heart disease, but not from any other cause.|$|E
2500|$|Back in 1984, the {{extrapolated}} {{statistics from}} relatively few records in only several {{states of the}} United States estimated that between 44,000-98,000 people annually die in hospitals because of medical errors. Much {{work has been done}} since then, including work by the author of that study who moved on from those low estimates back in the 1990s. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently says that 75,000 patients die annually, in hospitals alone, from infections alone - just one cause of harm in just one kind of care setting. From all causes there have been numerous other studies, including [...] "A New, Evidence-based Estimate of Patient Harms Associated with Hospital Care" [...] by John T. James, PhD that estimates 400,000 unnecessary deaths annually in hospitals alone. Using these numbers, medical malpractice is the third leading cause of death in the United States, only behind <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>and</b> <b>cancer.</b> Less than one quarter of care takes place in hospitals. Across all care settings the numbers are higher.|$|E
2500|$|Ethical {{standards}} of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO), the American Medical Association (AMA) Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs, and the American College of Physicians Ethics Manual require disclosure {{of the most serious}} adverse events. However, many doctors and hospitals do not report errors under the current system because of concerns about malpractice lawsuits; this prevents collection of information needed to find and correct the conditions that lead to mistakes. , 35 US states have statutes allowing doctors and health care providers to apologize and offer expressions of regret without their words being used against them in court, and 7 states have also passed laws mandating written disclosure of adverse events and bad outcomes to patients and families. In September 2005, US Senators Clinton and Obama introduced the National Medical Error Disclosure and Compensation (MEDiC) Bill, providing physicians protection from liability and a safe environment for disclosure, as part of a program to notify and compensate patients harmed by medical errors. It is now the policy of several academic medical centers, including Johns Hopkins, University of Illinois and Stanford, to promptly disclose medical errors, offering apologies and compensation. This national initiative, hoping to restore integrity to dealings with patients, make it easier to learn from mistakes and avoid angry lawsuits, was modeled after a University of Michigan Hospital System program that has reduced the number of lawsuits against the hospital by 75% and has decreased the average litigation cost. The Veterans Health Administration requires the disclosure of all adverse events to patients, even those that are not obvious. However, [...] these initiatives have only included hospitals that are self-insured and that employ their staffs, thus limiting the number of parties involved. Medical errors are the third leading cause of death in the US, after <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>and</b> <b>cancer,</b> according to research by Johns Hopkins University. Their study published in May 2016 concludes that more than 250,000 people die every year due to medical mix-ups. Other countries report similar results.|$|E

40|$|Development of a {{potential}} antioxidant molecule is gaining importance {{in the recent years}} as it plays an important role, in preventing or delaying the onset of certain pathological consequences such as hepatotoxicity, <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> <b>and</b> <b>cancer.</b> Cassia tora Linn.

In the present study, antioxidant activity of ethanolic extract of Cassia tora leaves was investigated using three in vitro assays, viz., total antioxidant capacity by phosphomolybdenum method, DPPH free radical scavenging assay and ferric ion reducing assay. L-Ascorbic acid was used as a reference antioxidant. The extract showed strong antioxidant activities in all the three assays, indicating that Cassia tora ethanolic extract functions as an efficient antioxidant to scavenge free radicals and reduces free radical induced cellular damage...|$|R

Stress can be defined, as a physical and psychological response of our body towards any external or internal stimuli. Stress is capable of corrupting the way an individual absorbs reality, solves problem, and thinks logically. Repeated exposures to psychological stress can lead to many chronic ailments such as <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> <b>and</b> <b>cancer.</b> Lack of robust methods to continuously monitor a person’s exposure to stress in the natural environment is the biggest challenge today.
