40|$|Refractories {{are used}} {{in a variety of}} {{processing}} industries including the ceramic, steel, aluminum, metal casting and heat treatment industries. Refractories provide thermal insulation, and do so by providing stagnant or "dead " gas space, namely, they contain a large volume fraction of voids. The prime criterion for material selection is refractoriness (i. e. use temperature) and the dimensional stability. One key property required for <b>insulating</b> <b>refractory</b> qualification is the service temperature limit (STL), which is related to composition, sinterability at use temperature, sintering temperature, and void volume.

40|$|Glass {{production}} is an energy intensive process, primarily requiring high temperature (≈ 1500 oC) heat, usually provided by combustion of fossil fuels. Concerns {{about the future}} depletion of fossil fuels and the emissions due to their combustion have driven a shift towards the use of alternative energy sources. Concentrated solar radiation is the only form of renewable energy which could directly provide the high temperature process heat required for glass production, without the otherwise necessary intermediate conversion to electricity and thereby avoiding the associated efficiency and capital costs. The technology for concentrating solar radiation using fields of heliostat mirrors to collectively generate a high intensity beam at a central focal point, is already well developed. However, {{the ability to use}} of such a solar beam to effect a viable glass making process involves significant challenges associated with the fact that glass furnaces typically require continuous and consistent process heat smoothly distributed, over large areas while concentrated solar radiation is only intermittently available and provides heat over relatively small areas with steep intensity gradients. In this project, experiments were conducted to incrementally develop and investigate the feasibility of an efficient and scalable process for manufacturing useful glasses with the primary process heat demand provided by a realistic concentrated solar beam. A High Flux Solar Simulator (HFSS) consisting of an array of xenon arc lamps, each coupled with an ellipsoidal reflector, was used to generate an artificial, controllable ‘solar’ beam. First, the HFSS beam was used to directly irradiate pure silica and soda-lime-silica glass forming batches contained inside <b>insulated,</b> <b>refractory</b> crucibles and directly irradiated by a realistic solar beam (intensity < 2000 kW/m 2). All silicate batches generated complete melt pools with full conversion from crystalline raw materials, to x-ray amorphous glasses but only soda-lime-silica batches would generate melts with sufficient fluidity to homogenise and remove entrained gases (fining) and thereby produce transparent glasses. Next, a series of experiments were conducted to investigate factors affecting the continuity of the process. Glass forming batch, directly irradiated by a vertical HFSS beam, was contained inside a modified apparatus which enabled the melt produced to sustain a continuous flow. A specially made batch feeder enabled additional raw materials to be intermittently fed into the melting zone while the beam was still on. It was demonstrated that a semi-continuous glass melting process could be realised using primarily concentrated solar heat. However, secondary heating was necessary to sustain the flow beyond the focal spot of the beam while avoiding fracture of the crucible due to thermal gradients induced by the beam. Also, the efficiency of this process was very poor (3 - 4...|$|R

Ceramics can be broken down into two general categories, traditional and advanced ceramics. Traditional ceramics include common household products such as clay pots, tiles, pipe, and bricks, porcelain china, sinks, and electrical insulators, and thermally <b>insulating</b> <b>refractory</b> bricks for ovens and fireplaces. Advanced ceramics, also referred to as ''high-tech'' ceramics, include products such as spark plug bodies, piston rings, catalyst supports, and water pump seals for automobiles, thermally insulating tiles for the space shuttle, sodium vapor lamp tubes in streetlights, and the capacitors, resistors, transducers, and varistors in the solid-state electronics we use daily. The major differences between traditional and advanced ceramics are in the processing tolerances and cost. Traditional ceramics are manufactured with inexpensive raw materials, are relatively tolerant of minor process deviations, and are relatively inexpensive. Advanced ceramics are typically made with more refined raw materials and processing to optimize a given property or combination of properties (e. g., mechanical, electrical, dielectric, optical, thermal, physical, and/or magnetic) for a given application.

The replacement of shaped instead of unshaped refractories is recently and strongly industrially demanded and belongs to ongoing research topics.

The foaming process was achieved by mixing of separately prepared aqueous foam into raw castable slurry or by in situ foaming of intensively mixed castable slurry with the surfactant additive. Nevertheless, the study of foam behaviour and the influence of additives on binder hydration and setting processes (i. e. calciumaluminate cement) was substantial for successful preparation of the experimental samples.

The incineration of MSW under existing legislation and operational boundary conditions is a very complex process with the application of two-stage combustion, minimization of emissions and production of energy (generally heat and electricity). In MSW incinerators, the first stage consists of combustion of heterogeneous waste on a moving grate that transports and mixes the waste during the combustion process. The grate combustion process involves drying, devolatilization, gasification/combustion and char burn-out. Thus, gasification and pyrolysis are subsets of the combustion problem. Mathematical modeling of combustion on the grate requires the solution of the flow field and concentrations of gaseous species in a reacting and moving bed, taking into account various heat transfer mechanisms.

40|$|The UCAR ® CHILL-KOTE ™ freeze lining concept {{combines}} wall cooling {{with carbon}} and graphite refrac-tories of higher thermal conductivities to “chill ” the refractory lining by transferring {{heat from the}} refractory lining. Effective sidewall water cooling, together with {{the efficiency of the}} heat dissipating conductive refrac-tories, lowers the temperature of the lining to below that of the molten process materials. This causes a layer of slag and process metal to solidify or “freeze ” and form a protective “skull ” which completely coats the refractory hot face. Once formed, the slag skull <b>insulates</b> the <b>refractories,</b> reducing heat loss and protect the lining from erosion, chemical attack, thermal shock, and other stresses. The result: extended life and greatly improved refractory performance. The Ilmenite smelting process depends on the presence of a solidified slag skull to protect sidewall refrac-tory material from chemical attach by molten slag. No known refractory material is able to withstand this corrosive material. To date, UCAR has not applied their Chill Kote ™ technology in the ilmenite smelting industry. This paper revolves around the results obtained from conducting an ilmenite smelting campaign on a 500 kW DC open-arc furnace with a UCAR designed refractory system. The purpose of this test was to es-tablish the effects such a lining has on refractory wear and the reduction-smelting process. Proper thermo-couple management enabled the authors to monitor lining wear {{for the duration of the}} campaign. Prior to the pilot-scale campaign, modeling work was completed to evaluate the feasibility of applying UCAR ® CHILL-KOTE ™ technology to ilmenite smelting furnaces. The successful operation of a pilot-scale furnace equipped with the UCAR ® CHILL-KOTE ™ lining as well as concise modeling suggest that it should be a viable option to consider for an industrial-scale furnace. 1...|$|R

Neither of these results make the fossil energy option desirable in the long term. Clean renewable energy sources provide one means of avoiding these problems. Many renewable energy resources, however, suffer from the problem of varying in power during diurnal and annual cycles. Solar energy suffers from both predictable variations (e. g., the daily solar cycle) and unpredictable variations (e. g., cloud cover). This problem can be addressed by any of several proposed energy storage options. In the present work, we develop a thermochemical storage concept where a reversible Ca(OH) 2 /CaO reaction is used to store energy. The system is integrated with a central receiver tower solar power plant using two circulating fluidized bed reactors. One reactor is used for an energy absorption process during the day, where the excess energy is used to drive the endothermic Ca(OH) 2 to CaO reaction. The other releases energy during the night using the reverse exothermic reaction. The energy absorbing reactor {{is placed in the}} tower where it receives heat reflected from the heliostat field where extended surfaces (fins) are used to improve heat flow into the fluidized bed. The energy discharging reactor is <b>insulated</b> using <b>refractory</b> with heat being absorbed by water/steam flowing inside water-walls that are in contact with the fluidized bed material. Conceptual design work suggests that one reactor will have a 7. 2 m diameter and a the other will have a 8 m diameter, with a height of 37. 5 m for both. It is estimated that the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) will be 19 cents/kWh, which is higher than LCOE of a concentrated solar power (CSP) plant with no storage system, however, electricity with the thermochemical thermal energy storage (TES) system will be produced consistently for 24 hours overcoming the intermittency problem of renewable energy source...|$|R

40|$|Rotary kilns are {{important}} {{in a variety of}} different manufacturing areas for e. g. calcination and sintering of materials. In fact, two of the most produced materials in the world, cement and iron, are likely to start their journey in a rotary kiln. A rotary kiln is a large cylinder-formed furnace which rotates about its axis and where certain chemical and physical reactions take place by the influence of heat. The slope and the rotation make the material inside to move through the kiln from feed to discharge end. Due to high process temperatures the casing of the kiln is <b>insulated</b> by a <b>refractory</b> lining. Service conditions inside the kiln are rough and the lining is continuously degrading, especially pronounced in the hot zone of the kiln. If the lining is significantly deteriorated and can no longer protect the casing from the heat − the production is shut-down − leading to very high production losses. Despite many improvements of rotary kilns in the past decades there is still a gap in the knowledge regarding refractory linings during usage. Many assumptions are based on practical knowledge. One explanation to this could be the difficulty to study and observe the lining due to kiln size and high operating temperatures. Today, computer programs are of a great help for studying various issues without causing production delays or risking failures. However, the field of rotary kilns has stagnated on this matter and very little documentation can be found regarding numerical simulations of the lining, especially of the thermomechanical character. Purpose of this licentiate work is to study the mechanical behaviour of the lining by means of the finite element method (FEM). For this, a simplified model of a kiln was created and various fundamental cases were studied. The commercial FE-software LS-DYNA is used for the FE-calculations. The main work is based on cases of the kiln in cold condition. However, an initial study in warm condition is presented as well. The studied lining was a brick lining used in a kiln of dimensions typical for iron-ore pelletizing. Additionally, this licentiate thesis gives an overview {{of some of the most}} fundamental issues encountered in a refractory brick lining of a rotary kiln in general. Some material tests are presented as well. Model’s geometry was based on a section at the position of the support wheels, having a thickness of one brick. Some simplifications, such as choice of the material model and a rigid riding tyre, were done and a three-fold faster computational time was achieved. Response of the created model was partly verified analytically, by available in-house data and data from literature. It was confirmed that the model gives a good response. One of the important findings is that despite variation of conditions in cold state, e. g. rotational speed and relative ovality of the kiln, the induced stresses in the lining remained harmless. This challenges traditional believes which imply that ovality is of considerable importance for stress generation in the lining. On the other hand, by continuously tracing gaps between the bricks and the casing, it was found that integrity of the lining was significantly affected by rotational speed and ovality. Gaps as large as 80 mm could be observed between bricks and casing in a worst case scenario. An initial study on the kiln in hot state was made. Thermal expansion of a perfectly lined and an disordered brick lining were performed. The results indicate that stresses due to thermal expansion are rising slightly but are harmless in both cases. Additionally, expansion of the kiln stabilizes the lining and the effect of rotation compared to rotation in cold state is small. Analytical and numerical calculations were compared, indicating that analytical assumptions are often coarse and misleading from the reality.

40|$|ISOLDE, the CERN Isotope Separator On-line DEvice is {{a unique}} source of low energy beams of {{radioactive}} isotopes - atomic nuclei that have too many or too few neutrons to be stable. The facility is like a small ‘chemical factory’, giving the possibility of changing one element to another, by selecting the atomic mass of the required isotope beam in the mass separator, rather as the ‘alchemists’ once imagined. It produces {{a total of more}} than 1000 different isotopes from helium to radium, with half-lives down to milliseconds, by impinging a 1. 4 GeV proton beam from the Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB) onto special targets, yielding a wide variety of atomic fragments. Different components then extract the nuclei and separate them according to mass. The post-accelerator REX (Radioactive beam EXperiment) at ISOLDE accelerates the radioactive beams up to 3 MeV/u for many experiments. A wide international user radioactive ion beam (RIB) community investigates fundamental aspects of nuclear physics, particle and atomic physics, solid-state physics, materials science, astrophysics, biophysics and medicine. However, there are still a number of radioactive isotopes which are not accessible for experimental physics, either because it has been impossible to produce the element of interest, too low yields (number of isotopes per second measured in the beam line) are obtained or due to the higher post-acceleration energies required f or the user’s experiments. The aim of this thesis was to synthesize oxide and carbide porous materials, to be used as thick targets to increase the intensity of exotic RIBs. This was done by the evaluation of their radioactive isotope release properties and of their stability under irradiation conditions at high temperatures. This thesis is focused on the study of the chemical and physical processes occurring in the target system where the isotopes are produced, before these enter the ion-source system, are mass-separated and are sent to the user beam lines. The products formed in nuclear reactions between a proton beam and the target must, at a first step, diffuse from the interior of the target out to the surface and evaporate from it. Minimum delay times for the diffusion process can be realized by achieving the shortest diffusion lengths of highly-permeable, lowdensity, open-structure targets and by operating at the highest possible temperature so that release times are minimized and commensurate with the half-life of the isotopes of interest. Whereas until now target materials with micro-scale structures have been synthesized and used for RIB production, new porous submicro- and nano-structured materials offer the advantage of having lower diffusion activation energy of atoms and thus larger diffusion coefficient than the corresponding bulk counterpart, thanks to the increase of surface to volume ratio of these materials. The potential of this phenomenon for isotope mass separation online (ISOL) targets and many other applications is an evident drop of temperature to maintain a fast diffusion process, and higher release efficiency for the production of intense exotic isotope beams. In Chapter 1 the ISOL technique and the RIB production issues are introduced, followed by a review of recent progresses on target materials to increase yield production in the principal existing and next-generation ISOL and In-Flight facilities worldwide. Chapter 2 gives the theoretical fundamentals of diffusion and effusion in solid materials, and addresses specifically diffusion, effusion and release properties of ISOL targets. The study presented in Chapter 3 consists in the evaluation of release properties in different polycrystalline silicon carbide samples. The diffusion coefficients for Be, Na, Mg and F isotopes were extracted from off-line release measurements done at ISOLDE. The full characterization of the release time structure inherent to the physical and chemical processes of the ISOL RIB production on a submicrometric SiC target material (target SiC # 334) used at ISOLDE, was made. This last target development resulted in improvement of magnesium short-lived isotopes yields. This was the first demonstration of the successful use of a submicrometric porous material as an ISOL target material, which delivered unprecedented 8 x 104 21 Mg ions per μC. In Chap ter 4, the synthesis of porous submicro- and nano-structured alumina to be used as an ISOL target, was followed by materials characterization in terms of microstructure and related with selected isotope release properties. Whenever possible, the release mechanisms were explained or proposed. The approach is relevant for the study of microstructure effects in other solid porous oxide and carbide targets, for optimization of their release performance. Chapter 5 shows the results of the TARPIPE experiment, set up within the design study task of the foreseen ISOL-type European facility called EURISOL, to investigate proton irradiation damage on typical and novel ISOL target materials under continuous proton irradiation at high temperature (&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; 1273 K). Materials such as SiC, Al 2 O 3, Y 2 O 3, C and Ta in a variety of forms were irradiated at the 72 MeV proton irradiation station of injector 1 at PSI (Paul Scherrer Institute). The effects of radiation damage on these materials were evaluated from microstructure and chemical analyses before and after irradiation by visual inspection, gamma spectroscopy, scanning electronic microscopy and electron dispersive X-ray analysis on a case-by-case basis. The moderate structure evolution of the porous oxide and carbide samples tested confirms that these materials are good candidates for high-power solid targets to be used at the existing and next generation hig h-power ISOL facilities, such as TRIUMF (TRI-University Meson Facility) and EURISOL (EURopean Isotope Separator On-line). In Chapter 6, the development and testing of a composite high-power alumina target for neon isotope production associated to a cold FEBIAD ion-source exposed to unprecedented proton beam intensities is reported. A 0. 5 GeV proton beam from TRIUMF was used up to 25 μA, a factor 10 with respect to the present oxide targets in operation. The yields obtained were compared to the ones delivered by using a 70 μA proton beam in SiC targets at this facility. The target performance in terms of diffusion properties was evaluated. A general conclusion and discussion are given in Chapter 7. The release studies obtained with irradiation and ion implantation techniques on prospective SiC and Al 2 O 3 matrices resulted in the identification of alternative target matrices for fast radioisotope release; this was confirmed experimentally from Na and Mg elements release efficiency determined online for a SiC target. A high-power oxide/metal composite target made of micrometric structural length scale Al 2 O 3 pellets and Nb foils was operated online at unprecedented beam power intensities. Composite targets made of Nb foils and submicro- and nano-structured porous Al 2 O 3 are expected to further increase yields of exotic isotopes. This ISOL target concept can be applied in the future for many other <b>refractory</b> <b>insulating</b> ceramics by u sing gradient microstructures and/or different ceramic/metallic combinations. Special care has to be taken, in order to minimize the stress induced by a mismatch of the coefficient of thermal expansion in the different ceramic layers and/or the underlying metallic substrate. Micro- and nano-technology fabrication techniques can be used to tailor pore and grain size distribution in ceramic and metallic complex-shaped composite materials and to shape these in compacts, monoliths and fenestrated structures. A balance between large surface area and large macropore volume for optimum target radioisotope release performance must be achieved. The resulting target material must in addition be stable at high temperatures, have good thermomechanical resistance and high thermal conductivity under irradiation for long irradiation time. The understanding of isotope release mechanisms in different solid materials, including the porous and dense fast-ion conductors will contribute to the production of exotic RIB at unprecedented high-intensity...|$|R
