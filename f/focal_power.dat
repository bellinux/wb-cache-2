In January 1918, General Allenby used five Australian pilots from No. 1 Squadron AFC to photograph a 624 sq mi area in Palestine as an aid to correcting and improving maps of the Turkish front. This was a pioneering use of aerial photography as an aid for cartography. Lieutenants Leonard Taplin, Allan Runciman Brown, H. L. Fraser, Edward Patrick Kenny, and L. W. Rogers photographed a block of land stretching from the Turkish front lines 32 mi deep into their rear areas. Beginning 5 January, they flew with a fighter escort to ward off enemy fighters. Using Royal Aircraft Factory BE.12 and Martinsyde airplanes, they not only overcame enemy air attacks, but also had to contend with 65 mph winds, antiaircraft fire, and malfunctioning equipment to complete their task.|$|E
5000|$|The young {{human eye}} can change focus from {{distance}} (infinity) to {{as near as}} 6.5 cm from the eye. This dramatic change in <b>focal</b> <b>power</b> of the eye of approximately 15 dioptres (the reciprocal of focal length in metres) occurs {{as a consequence of}} a reduction in zonular tension induced by ciliary muscle contraction. This process can occur in as little as 350 milliseconds [...] The amplitude of accommodation declines with age. By the fifth decade of life the accommodative amplitude can decline so that the near point of the eye is more remote than the reading distance. When this occurs the patient is presbyopic. Once presbyopia occurs, those who are emmetropic (do not require optical correction for distance vision) will need an optical aid for near vision; those who are myopic (nearsighted and require an optical correction for distance vision), will find that they see better at near without their distance correction; and those who are hyperopic (farsighted) will find that they may need a correction for both distance and near vision. Note that these effects are most noticeable when the pupil is large; i.e. in dim light. The age-related decline in accommodation occurs almost universally to less than 2 dioptres by the time a person reaches 45 to 50 years, by which time most of the population will have noticed a decrease in their ability to focus on close objects and hence require glasses for reading or bifocal lenses. Accommodation decreases to about 1 dioptre at the age of 70 years. The dependency of accommodation amplitude on age is graphically summarized by Duane's classical curves.|$|E
40|$|Switchable {{liquid crystal}} contact lenses with {{electrically}} controllable focal powers have previously been investigated {{as an alternative}} to bifocal contact lenses and spectacles for the correction of presbyopia. The simplest lens design uses a meniscus shaped cavity within the lens to contain the liquid crystal. The design of such a lens is considered in detail, including the nematic alignment and electrodes materials. The organic transparent conductor PEDOT:PSS was used as both electrode and planar alignment. Four different configurations are considered, using both planar and homeotropic orientations with either homogenous or axial alignment. Controllable switching of the <b>focal</b> <b>power</b> was demonstrated for each mode and <b>focal</b> <b>power</b> changes of up to ΔP= 3. 3 ± 0. 2 D achieved.

40|$|This note {{concerns}} the focusing {{properties of the}} positron-capture solenoid. Such a solenoid will be placed before {{the entrance of the}} 450 MeV positron linear-accelerator injector in the APS. The 1. 25 A, 40 ns electron beam is accelerated in the 200 MeV electron linac. This beam is then focused onto a 3 mm diameter spot at the 7 mm thick tungsten target. By the process of multiple nuclear-scattering the target generates the positron particles. These positrons, in general, can have a large diverging angle. In order to capture these rapidly diverging positrons, a relatively strong focusing lens is placed close to the converter. In this case a magnetic solenoidal lens has an advantage over the usual quadrupole lens because of its larger phase-space acceptance. In particular, the solenoidal lens is noted for its capability of controlling the spin direction of polarized ions. The authors first wrote down the expression for the magnetic field distribution on the axis for the solenoidal lens. From this expression they derive the expressions for the first- and second-order field distributions at any point in the region. They then calculate and compare the <b>focal</b> <b>powers</b> at various distances off the axis. Further, they calculate and include the third- and fourth-order components of the fields and compare them with the previous results. Finally, they briefly consider the particle trajectories through these fields and present the result in terms of the particle motion in phase space...|$|R

The model builds on previous research on IOS {{adoption and}} proposes that the relative power of a firm and its intent of adoption toward a specific IOS together predetermine its position in the decision.

40|$|In lightcraft vehicle system, a ringy {{laser beam}} is focused by a 90 ° {{off-axis}} annular parabolic mirror. In this paper, methods are applied combining the geometrical optics {{and the physical}} optics. The effects of the angular misalignment of the optical axis and divergent angle on the <b>focal</b> <b>power</b> density are analyzed. Ray tracing shows that a pair of vertical focal lines is produced due to the angular misalignment. Basing on this, and from the theory of diffraction optics, we can know that the incident Gaussian beam will become the beam {{that is similar to}} the elliptical Gaussian mode for the misalignment. Moreover, the <b>focal</b> <b>power</b> density is decreased due to the angular misalignment. The parabolic mirror is very sensitive to misalignment of the incident beam, and the misalignment angle on the order of magnitude of mrad magnitude is enough to decrease peak power density down to the half.

When the incident angle has a divergent angle, coma is produced that also decrease the power density at focal plane...|$|E
40|$|Presbyopia is an age-related {{disorder}} {{where the}} lens of the eye hardens so that focusing on near objects becomes increasingly difficult. This complaint affects everyone over the age of 50. It is becoming progressively more relevant, as {{the average age of the}} global population continues to rise. Bifocal or varifocal spectacles are currently the best solution for those that require near and far vision correction. However, many people prefer not to wear spectacles and while multifocal contact lenses are available, they are not widely prescribed and can require significant adaptation by wearers. One possible solution is to use liquid crystal contact lenses that can change <b>focal</b> <b>power</b> by applying a small electric field across the device. However, the design of these contact lenses must be carefully considered as they must be comfortable for the user to wear and able to provide the required change in <b>focal</b> <b>power</b> (usually about + 2 D).

40|$|Presbyopia is a {{ubiquitous}} age-related disability of the eye, affecting {{an estimated}} 1. 04 billion people worldwide, reducing {{their ability to}} focus on nearby objects. The various solutions to this inevitable vision deterioration are not compromise-free, with a growing need for approaches beyond conventional spectacles. The research motivation for this work is the unique solution offered by liquid crystal (LC) contact lenses to create compromise-free vision across the whole field of view. The distinctive property of LC lenses {{is that they are}} switchable, with the application of a voltage activating the lens. The change in <b>focal</b> <b>power</b> is facilitated via a voltage-dependent change in refractive index of the LC. We have successfully demonstrated several versions of electrically switchable LC contact lenses with variable additional optical power of up to + 3. 00 D, ideal for the correction of presbyopia. This paper offers a review of the optical and electro-optical performance recently demonstrated for the different modes of operation realized in nematic systems, including planar (homogeneous) and vertically aligned (homeotropic) aligned devices. The change in optical power obtained depends on the choice of geometry and LC material. A material with higher birefringence allows a thinner LC-lens layer to achieve a particular <b>focal</b> <b>power.</b> In the homeotropic geometry, the refractive index of the LC layer is a minimum in the ‘off’ state (ordinary refractive index, n_o) and the mode is polarization-independent, offering a significant advantage over planar lens designs. The construction is also simplified as only one alignment layer needs to be rubbed. Depending on the geometry used, continuously variable changes in <b>focal</b> <b>power</b> of up to + 3. 00 D have been achieved. The response time of the lenses can be better than half a second, achieved with small applied voltages of ~ 7 V_rms. A further important stage in the optimization of the contact lenses is the inclusion of graphene as the electrodes. Conventional ITO electrodes are too brittle for these flexible optical systems. The paper also reviews the successful incorporation of graphene into the lenses, with excellent optical and electro-optical results. The device demonstrates the huge potential of graphene in an unconventional liquid crystal device geometry that includes curvature over a relatively large area...|$|E
