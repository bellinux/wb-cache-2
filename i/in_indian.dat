40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} {{hypothesis}} that the higher rates of coronary heart disease (CHD) <b>in</b> <b>Indians</b> (South Asians) compared with Malays and Chinese is partly because of differences in antioxidants (vitamins A, C, and E, and selenium) and pro-oxidants (iron). DESIGN: Cross sectional study of the general population. SETTING: Singapore. PARTICIPANTS: Random sample of 941 persons aged 30 to 69 years. MAIN RESULTS: There were moderate correlations between vitamin A and vitamin E, and between these vitamins and selenium. Mean plasma vitamins A and E were similar by ethnic group. Vitamin A concentration for Indians were (men 0. 66 and women 0. 51 mg/l), Malays (men 0. 67 and women 0. 54 mg/l), and Chinese (men 0. 68 and women 0. 52 mg/l). Vitamin E concentrations for Indians were (men 12. 9 and women 12. 8 mg/l), Malays (men 13. 6 and women 13. 3 mg/l), and Chinese (men 12. 6 and women 12. 6 mg/l). In contrast, mean plasma vitamin C concentrations were lower <b>in</b> <b>Indians</b> (men 5. 7 and women 6. 9 mg/l) and Malays (men 5. 1 and women 6. 4 mg/l) than Chinese (men 6. 3 and women 8. 4 mg/l). Mean serum selenium was lower <b>in</b> <b>Indians</b> (men 117 and women 115 micrograms/l) than Malays (men 122 and women 122 micrograms/l) and Chinese (men 126 and women 119 micrograms/l). Mean serum ferritin was much lower <b>in</b> <b>Indians</b> (men 132 and women 50 micrograms/l) than Malays (men 175 and women 85 micrograms/l) and Chinese (men 236 and women 92 micrograms/l). MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Lower vitamin C and selenium <b>in</b> <b>Indians,</b> particularly <b>in</b> combination, could play a part in their increased risk of CHD. Vitamins A and E, and ferritin (iron) have no such role. Lower vitamin C <b>in</b> <b>Indians</b> and Malays is probably because of its destruction by more prolonged cooking. <b>In</b> <b>Indians,</b> lower selenium is probably because of a lower dietary intake and the much lower ferritin to a lower dietary intake of iron and its binding by phytates...|$|R
