5000|$|The <b>latch</b> <b>hook</b> tool traces {{its origin}} to the {{invention}} of the latch needle. Invented in 1847, the latch needle was part of a knitting machine that wrapped yarn around the latch and pushed through a canvas before pulling it through and knotting the yarn to the canvas. In the 1920s, the tool was created by combining the hand <b>hook</b> with the <b>latch.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A <b>latch</b> <b>hook</b> is {{both the}} tool and the textile art of <b>latch</b> <b>hooking.</b> <b>Latch</b> <b>hooking</b> differs from {{traditional}} rug hooking and locker hooking by the physical knotting of the yarn to canvas. <b>Latch</b> <b>hook</b> was invented {{in the nineteenth century}} with the latch needle, in the twentieth century the latch needle underwent numerous variations including the hand tool used by artisans and crafters to produce <b>latch</b> <b>hook</b> rugs. While rug hooking uses a base fabric of burlap or hessian, <b>latch</b> <b>hooking</b> uses specially woven rug canvas. Rug canvases range from 3.3 holes per inch (hpi) to 5 hpi. The pattern may be stencilled onto the canvas or worked from a chart similar to a needlepoint pattern. <b>Latch</b> <b>hook</b> yarns may be bough pre-cut (usually 2.5 inch lengths) or in skeins and cut to the desired length.In his book [...] "The Hooked Rug," [...] published in 1930, American writer William Winthrop Kent describes a form of rugmaking [...] "A canvas is used like cross-stitch canvas only coarser, which has every third mesh a large one. It is held on the knee or on a table. The pieces of wool yarn are cut exactly the same length by a gauge. The hook used has a catch or latch on it and is inserted in one hole and out the next in the next row, as follows: The wool is held in the left hand and above the canvas, then doubled and the double end is slipped over the hook, the catch being up or open. The hook is then drawn out through the canvas toward the worker, the cut ends being kept in the left hand. The catch by this action drops down and secures the wool. The tool is next pushed forward through the wool loop and catches the two ends held in the left hand, then the loop is held in the left hand and has the two ends pulled through it with the hook. To pull out hook and draw tight the two cut ends finishes the knot. This is really a pile fabric and is known as a Turkey Rug but sprang from the hooking process as the earlier hook used was of the crochet hook form." ...|$|R

Lene Schneider-Kainer, (16 May, 1885, Vienna, Austria - 15 June, 1971, Cochabamba, Bolivia), was a Jewish-Austrian artist, daughter of the painter Sigmund Schneider. She studied art throughout Europe, and married Ludwig Kainer in 1910. Schneider-Kainer made her debut as an artist in 1917 with an exhibition at the Galerie Gurlitt, and through the 1920 s she became renowned as painter and illustrator. In 1926 Lene left Berlin after her divorce and for two years accompanied the poet Bernhard Kellermann on an extended odyssey retracing the steps of Marco Polo.

5|$|Chris Hadfield, a Canadian Space Agency {{astronaut}} and STS-74 mission specialist, {{used the}} shuttle's robot arm to hoist the docking module {{out of the}} aft portion of the payload bay, rotated it to a vertical position, and moved it to within five inches of the Orbiter Docking System. At that point, the shuttle fired its downward steering jets and moved the shuttle toward the docking module. Once the two spacecraft were locked together, the docking ring on the Orbiter Docking System retracted, {{and a series of}} <b>hooks</b> and <b>latches</b> were engaged to ensure an airtight seal between the two spacecraft.|$|R
50|$|Soft Docking was {{confirmed}} shortly thereafter and <b>hooks</b> and <b>latches</b> were closed 10 minutes after docking {{to form a}} hard-mate between space station and the Soyuz TMA-03M spacecraft.

40|$|The {{international}} Low Impact Docking System (iLIDS) {{provides a}} structural arrangement {{that allows for}} visiting vehicles to dock with the International Space Station (ISS) (Fig 1). The iLIDS docking units are mechanically joined together {{by a series of}} active and passive <b>latch</b> <b>hooks.</b> In order to preserve docking capability at the existing Russian docking interfaces, the iLIDS <b>latch</b> <b>hooks</b> are required to conform to the existing Russian design. The <b>latch</b> <b>hooks</b> are classified as being fail-safe. Since the <b>latch</b> <b>hooks</b> are fail-safe, the hooks are not fracture critical and a fatigue based service life assessment will satisfy the structural integrity requirements. Constant amplitude fatigue testing to failure on four sets of active/passive iLIDS <b>latch</b> <b>hooks</b> was performed at load magnitudes of 10, 11, and 12 kips. Failure analysis of the hook fatigue failures identified multi-site fatigue initiation that was effectively centered about the hook mid-plane (consistent with the 3 D model results). The fatigue crack initiation distribution implies that the fatigue damage accumulation effectively results in a very low aspect ratio surface crack (which can be simulated as thru-thickness crack). Fatigue damage progression resulted in numerous close proximity fatigue crack initiation sites. It was not possible to determine if fatigue crack coalescence occurs during cyclic loading or as result of the fast fracture response. The presence of multiple fatigue crack initiation sites on different planes will result in the formation of ratchet marks as the cracks coalesce. Once the stable fatigue crack becomes unstable and the fast fracture advances across the remaining ligament and the plane stress condition at a free-surface will result in failure along a 45 deg. shear plane (slant fracture) and the resulting inclined edge is called a shear lip. The hook thickness on the plane of fatigue crack initiation is 0. 787 ". The distance between the shear lips on this plane was on the order of 0. 48 " and it was effectively centered about the mid-plane of the section. The numerous ratchet marks between the shear lips on the fracture initiation plane are indicative of multiple fatigue initiation sites within this region. The distribution of the fatigue damage about the centerline of the hook is consistent with the analytical results that demonstrate peak stress/strain response at the mid-plane that decreases {{in the direction of the}} hook outer surfaces. Scanning electron microscope images of the failed sections detected fatigue crack striations in close proximity to the free surface of the hook radius. These findings were documented at three locations on the fracture surface : 1) adjacent to the left shear lip, 2) adjacent to the right shear lip, and 3) near the centerline of the section. The features of the titanium fracture surface did not allow for a determination of a critical crack size via identification of the region where the fatigue crack propagation became unstable. The fracture based service life projections where benchmarked with strain-life analyses. The strainrange response in the hook radius was defined via the correlated finite element models and the modified method of universal slopes was incorporated to define the strain-life equation for the titanium alloy. The strain-life assessment confirmed that the fracture based projections were reasonable for the loading range of interest. Based upon the analysis and component level fatigue test data a preliminary service life capability for the iLIDS active and passive hooks of 2 lifetimes is projected (includes a scatter factor of 4) ...|$|R
