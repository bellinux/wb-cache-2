Connors refuses to rush the drug-testing {{procedure}} and put innocent people at risk. Ratha fires Connors and decides to test Connors' serum at a Veterans Administration hospital {{under the guise of}} a flu shot. In an act of desperation, Connors tries the formula on himself.

Discovering that Ratha <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the VA hospital, Connors, whose skin is turning green and scaly, goes to intercept him. By the time he gets to the Williamsburg Bridge, Connors has become a violent hybrid of lizard and man, tossing cars, including Ratha's, over the side. Peter, now calling himself Spider-Man, snatches each falling car with his web-lines.|$|E

She tricks her way in to see Ragnar and claims she is Iorek's dæmon, created in an experiment at Bolvangar. As panserbjørne do not have dæmons, Ragnar is furious that Iorek should have something he cannot possess, and so Lyra tells him that for her to become his dæmon, he must kill Iorek in single combat. As such, Ragnar orders the guards to allow Iorek to approach. Iorek and Ragnar fight, and Iorek kills Ragnar.|$|E
25|$|Sambhāvanā (Hindi: सम्भावना, meaning Competency): Sambhāvanā or {{competency}} is vividly {{described in}} the first ten verses of the canto. Aṣṭāvakra is brimming with confidence as he approaches Mithilā. Mithilā is replete with scholars versed in the Vedas and all the six Āstika schools. The twelve-year olds Aṣṭāvakra and Śvetaketu run into Janaka, who <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the court. Janaka asks his guards to get the handicapped boy out of his way. Aṣṭāvakra responds by saying that Janaka {{should get out of}} his way instead, as he (Aṣṭāvakra) is a Brāhmaṇa versed in the scriptures. Pleased with his brilliance, Janaka tells Aṣṭāvakra that he is free to roam anywhere in Mithilā. However, Janaka's gatekeeper does not let Aṣṭāvakra into the court, and tells him that only the learned and wise elders deserve to be in Janaka's court. Aṣṭāvakra makes the gatekeeper speechless by his definition of elders – only those grown in knowledge are the elders. The gatekeeper now lets him into an assembly consisting of sages like Yājñavalkya, Gārgī and Maitreyī. Aṣṭāvakra openly challenges Bandī for a scriptural debate. Janaka asks Aṣṭāvakra to satisfy him first in debate, and poses him six cryptic questions, which Aṣṭāvakra answers convincingly. Janaka offers him Bandī, who knows within himself he will lose to Aṣṭāvakra, but decides to openly debate. Bandī mocks Aṣṭāvakra's deformities and the assembly laughs. Aṣṭāvakra chides both Bandī and the assembly and declares his intention to leave the assembly.|$|E

500|$|Gaga covered [...] "Orange Colored Sky" [...] {{during a}} {{surprise}} appearance at The Oak Room in New York City on September 29, 2010, {{and again on}} January 5, 2011. Brian Newman served as a guest performer on trumpet for performances at the Robin Hood Gala on May 9, 2011, to benefit the Robin Hood Foundation, and at BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend in Carlisle, England on May 15, 2011. Gaga later performed it on the ABC Christmas special A Very Gaga Thanksgiving, along with a cover version of [...] "White Christmas". Gaga put emphasis on the jazz side of the song. She added a second verse, describing the original song as [...] "too short". In the verse, Gaga describes a snowman, saying that Santa Claus <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> meet him. The lyrics end with Gaga saying, [...] "Okay, so I suppose it's not very white outside yet." [...] The songs on A Very Gaga Holiday were recorded during the shooting of A Very Gaga Thanksgiving at the Convent of the Sacred Heart, New York City.|$|E
500|$|The album's opening song is [...] "Reception", an instrumental, {{in which}} McCartney {{attempted}} {{to capture the}} effect of turning a radio dial and finding [...] "about four stations at once". The track features a guitar-controlled synthesizer (played by Juber) over a funk-inspired bassline, and spoken voices, including a reading of part of [...] "The Poodle and the Pug", from Vivian Ellis's opera Big Ben (1946). A brief segment from the track [...] "The Broadcast", which appears later on Back to the Egg, is previewed in this opening piece. The next three songs – [...] "Getting Closer", [...] "We're Open Tonight" [...] and [...] "Spin It On" [...] – adhere to the proposed album-wide concept. Writing in Melody Maker in June 1979, Mark Williams interpreted [...] "Reception" [...] as representing a radio being tuned in a car, whereby [...] "the occupant <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> a gig, hence 'Getting Closer' [...] and, upon arrival, 'We're Open Tonight'". The notion of live performance is then reflected in the sequencing of what Madinger and Easter term [...] "heavier rock tracks such as 'Spin It On'".|$|E
500|$|Rossen filmed The Hustler {{over six}} weeks, entirely in New York City. Much {{of the action}} was filmed at two now-defunct pool halls, McGirr's and Ames Billiard Academy. Other {{shooting}} locations included a townhouse on East 82nd Street, which served as the Louisville home of Murray Hamilton's character Findley, and the Manhattan Greyhound bus terminal. The film crew built a dining area that was so realistic that confused passengers sat there and waited to place their orders. Willie Mosconi served as technical advisor on the film and shot {{a number of the}} trick shots in place of the actors. All of Gleason's shots were his own; they were filmed in wide-angle to emphasize having the actor and the shot in the same frames. Rossen, in pursuit of the style he termed [...] "neo-neo-realistic", hired actual street thugs, enrolled them in the Screen Actors Guild and used them as extras. Scenes that were included in the shooting script but did not make it into the final film include a scene at Ames pool hall establishing that Eddie <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> town (originally slated to be the first scene of the film) and a longer scene of Preacher talking to Bert at Johnny's Bar which establishes Preacher is a junkie.|$|E

A little girl [...] is a passenger in the same train. She shows that she feels sorry for the man. He in turn appreciates her sympathy. The train is wrecked, and the sheriff, who is handcuffed to Bill, is killed. Bill takes the key of the handcuffs {{from the pocket of}} the dead man, frees himself, and is about to escape, when he notices that the little girl, abandoned by her nurse, is lying unconscious in the car, which is now on fire. The convict risks his life to save the child, and carries her out in his arms. He takes her to her nurse and is recognized by a policeman and taken in custody, his chance for freedom lost. The child, who is the daughter of the governor, although Bill does not know it, is restored to her parent. The nurse fears to mention the incident, and the governor does not know how his darling's life was saved. Later the governor goes to the state prison on a tour of inspection, and Nell accompanies him. She has some flowers which she wants to give to the prisoners. In her tour of the prison, she recognizes Bill. She tells her father about it, and he pardons the hero-convict on the spot...." ...|$|E
2500|$|The game {{begins as}} the Roman army, {{under the command}} of centurion Agrippa (voiced by Rick Weiss), is {{fighting}} a Germanic army in the northeastern provinces.

[...] As he is cremated in the Foro Romano, Cicero (Peter Renaday) reveals the assassin to the public; Vipsanius (Daniel Riordan), Agrippa's father. As Vipsanius maintains his innocence, Cicero announces Caesar's successor, Antonius (Chris Cox). Listening from the crowd, Octavianus (Scott Menville), Caesar's nephew, refuses to believe Vipsanius is guilty. Meanwhile, in Germania, Agrippa receives word of Caesar's death, and orders him men to return to Rome.|$|E
