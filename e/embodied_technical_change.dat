In sharp contrast to Phelps (1962), we show that {{a change in the}} composition of <b>technical</b> <b>change</b> affects the growth rate in the long run. We also provide an alternative explanation for the productivity slowdown: an increase in the fraction of <b>embodied</b> <b>technical</b> progress, through an improvement in the learning efficiency of the capital goods sector, permanently lowers the growth rate of technological progress, by increasing the obsolescence costs of investment. The productivity slowdown occurs together with a rise in the rate of decline of investment goods prices.

This paper attempts to fill this gap by merging the estimates of quality change obtained from the price literature on quality change with a version of the conventional sources of growth model which allows for both <b>embodied</b> and disembodied <b>technical</b> <b>change.</b> This resulting estimates suggest that as much as 20 percent of the total factor productivity in growth U.

40|$|International audienceIt {{has been}} {{suggested}} that disasters might have positive economic consequences, through the accelerated replacement of capital. This possibility {{is referred to as the}} productivity effect. This effect is investigated using a model with <b>embodied</b> <b>technical</b> <b>change.</b> in this framework, disasters can influence the production level but cannot influence the growth rate, in the same way than the saving ratio in a Solow-like model. Depending on reconstruction quality, indeed, accounting for <b>embodied</b> <b>technical</b> <b>change</b> can either decrease or increase disaster costs, but is never able to turn disasters into positive events. Moreover, a better but slower reconstruction amplifies the short-term consequences of disasters, but pays off over the long-term. Regardless, the productivity effect cannot prevent the existence of a bifurcation when disaster damages exceed the reconstruction capacity, potentially leading to poverty traps. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.

40|$|This study investigates whether capital-skill {{complementarity}} is {{the explanation}} for skill-biased technical change. For {{this to be the}} case, capital-skill complementarity must exist in the first place and, secondly, all technical change must be embodied in nature, i. e. embedded in new capital equipment. To test if these conditions are satisfied, a capital-age adjusted translog production function incorporating both embodied and disembodied technical change is implemented on a 14 -industry panel for Swedish manufacturing 1985 - 95. The findings cast doubt on the claim that capital-skill complementarity can explain skill-biased technical change. In several industries, the capital-skill complementarity hypothesis is not supported. Moreover, it is found that the demand for skilled labor is affected by both disembodied and <b>embodied</b> <b>technical</b> <b>change.</b> An additional important result {{is that there is a}} negative skill-bias associated with <b>embodied</b> <b>technical</b> <b>change.</b> Capital-skill complementarity; skill-biased technical change...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{technical}} {{progress in the}} energy efficiency of US households' capital stock (appliances and passenger cars) and its potential for energy saving. An increase in the energy efficiency of households can only be achieved via a different capital stock. The link between the average energy efficiency and the stock of energy-using durables is econometrically estimated based on a new data set of household appliances and passenger cars. This relationship complements a Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System (QUAIDS) for six consumption categories (non-durables), including heating, electricity and transport. Any increase in energy efficiency lowers the corresponding "service" price and leads to a "rebound effect".

40|$|Modern {{economic}} growth is characterized by structural changes based on {{the introduction of new}} technologies into economics. The replacement and renova­ tion of technologies in industrial environments undergoing <b>technical</b> <b>change</b> is clearly one of the key aspects of economic development. The mathematical modeling of evolutionary economics under <b>technical</b> <b>change</b> (TC) has been rigorously considered by many authors during last decades. There is a wide variety of economic approaches and models describing different aspects of <b>technical</b> <b>change.</b> Among these are the models of <b>embodied</b> <b>technical</b> progress [19], [35], [70], [129], endogenous growth models [94], [102], the models of technological innovations [31], [32], [41], and others. The perspective self­ organization evolutionary approach is developed in [20], [38], [122], [123], [124], [126], which unites the aspects of diffusion of new technologies, technological and behavioral diversity of firms, learning mechanisms, age-dependent effects, and other important features of real-life economics. On the whole, an interest in evolutionary economics has brought considerable progress in the description and conceptualization of the sources, characteristics, direction and effects of <b>technical</b> <b>change</b> [125]. However, the modeling and control of technology lifetime under <b>technical</b> <b>change</b> has received rather little attention in mathematical economics in con­ trary to other aspects of technical progress.
