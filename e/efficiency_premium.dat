40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the first {{analysis of the}} two-tier market hypothesis, regarding realized operational efficiency in the VLCC spot freight rates. Investigating this hypothesis is an important objective, because {{the existence of an}} <b>efficiency</b> <b>premium</b> in the spot market will induce ship owners to invest in more environmentally friendly vessels. We utilize a panel data set of 1, 007 voyage rate fixtures between January 2013 and September 2016, on routes between the Persian Gulf and the Eastern part of Asia. We test for an energy <b>efficiency</b> <b>premium</b> by implementing two different multiple regression models, firstly by adopting the traditional approach using an “external” market index as the market proxy. Our results suggest that the market rate proxy for a standardised vessel is dominant in terms of explanatory power, and our findings show no evidence for an <b>efficiency</b> <b>premium</b> after controlling for macro-, contract- and ship-specific variables. Secondly, seeking to circumvent the problems, which the market rate proxy presents, we construct a new market indicator from microdata. We control for contract- and ship-specific variables, as well as time, charter and owner fixed effects, and we find weak evidence for a two-tier market where energy-efficient vessels attract a premium in the freight rates. In a separate analysis, we examine whether fuel-inefficient vessels, which in theory should have a competitive disadvantage against more efficient ships, compensate by slowing down their speed. By estimating a multiple regression model with macro- and ship-specific variables, our findings suggest that energy-inefficient vessels tend to correspond to higher operational speed...|$|E
40|$|To {{explain why}} firms with high {{research}} and development (R&D) intensity offer their investors higher stock returns, we argue that (1) high R&D capacity relative to firm valuation makes R&D-intensive firms attractive takeover targets, and that (2) the higher takeover probability leads their investors to face higher takeover risk, as proposed by Cremers, Nair, and John (2009), and require higher returns. We find evidence consistent with our hypothesis. Furthermore, we find that takeover probability also relates to large R&D increases, but not to innovation efficiency. Accordingly, we expect and find that takeover risk helps to explain the premium associated with large R&D increases, but not the innovation <b>efficiency</b> <b>premium</b> previously documented.

40|$|Empirical work on Akerlof 2 ̆ 019 s {{theory of}} gift {{exchange}} in labor markets has {{concentrated on the}} fair wage-effort hypothesis. In fact, however, the theory also contains a social component that stipulates that homogenous agents that are employed for the same wage level will exert more effort, resulting in higher rents and higher market efficiency, than agents that receive different wages. We present the first test of this component, which we call the fair uniform-wage hypothesis. In our laboratory experiment, we establish {{the existence of a}} significant <b>efficiency</b> <b>premium</b> of uniform wages. However, it is not the consequence of a stronger level of reciprocity by agents, but of the retrenchment of sanctioning options on the side of principals with uniform wages.

40|$|In {{this article}} we perform an {{economic}} analysis of different regulatory frameworks that aim at guaranteeing solidarity in competitive health insurance markets. Thereafter, we analyse the legal conformity of these intervention strategies with EC law. We find that risk compensation schemes are the first-best intervention strategy because they guarantee an ‘acceptable level of solidarity’ without hindering free trade and competition and without reducing efficiency. Second-best options are premium and excess-loss compensation schemes, which guarantee solidarity {{at the expense of}} some <b>efficiency.</b> <b>Premium</b> rate restrictions and open enrolment should be avoided because they reduce efficiency and are unnecessary, not proportional, and undesirable to the pursuit of the general good. These conclusions are relevant for EU countries that adopt premium rate restrictions and open enrolment in combination with a risk compensation scheme, such as Ireland and the Netherlands. In these countries policy makers should design the health insurance schemes in conformity with EC law, for example by replacing premium rate restrictions and open enrolment with premium and/or excess-loss compensation schemes...|$|E

We utilise the Australian Business Longitudinal Survey (1995 - 98) and the BHPS (1990 - 2002) to estimate the impact of excess managerial pay on labour productivity and worker pay satisfaction.

5000|$|For 60 Hz operation, the IE2 and IE3 minimum {{full-load}} efficiency {{values are}} virtually {{identical to the}} North American National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) [...] Energy Efficient and <b>Premium</b> <b>Efficiency</b> motor standards, respectively. (NEMA does specify different full-load efficiency values for motors with Totally Enclosed Fan-Cooled and Open Drip-proof enclosures and from 200HP IEC IE3 efficiency is slightly higher than NEMA <b>Premium</b> <b>Efficiency).</b> The IEC minimum full-load efficiency standards are higher for 60 Hz motors than for 50 Hz motors. This is because {{as long as the}} motor torque is constant, I2R or winding resistance losses are the same at 50 Hz and 60 Hz. The motor output power, however, increases linearly with speed, increasing by 20% when the frequency is increased from 50 Hz to 60 Hz. In general, the 60 Hz efficiency is about 2.5% to 0.5% greater than the 50 Hz values. The efficiency gain is greater for smaller motor power ratings.|$|R

In order to promote the implementation of these measures, the Tariff Code establishes that the implementation costs of a measure {{and half of the}} net benefits will be reflected in the SEP supply tariffs. In this paper we analyze different criteria for valuing DSM measures, evaluating its effect in benefit cost ratio of the measures, in its merit order, in the total benefits value and, lastly, in the value that will be accepted in the SEP supply tariffs. It is shown that despite the attribution of high environmental premiums for the implementation of DSM measures, the costs for ton of CO 2 avoided are more reduced than those which would result from the implementation of equivalent measures from the supply side.

40|$|Following the {{implications}} of term structure theory in an efficient bond market, this study formulates a random walk model that produces unbiased and efficient forecasts of the 30 -year mortgage rate for 1987 - 2006. Forecast accuracy improves with a reduction in lead time but deteriorates {{with an increase in}} the forecast horizon. We find, however, no clear trend indicating that forecast accuracy has improved over time. From a more practical perspective, the random walk forecasts of the 30 -year mortgage rate and prepayment premium (the spread between 30 -year mortgage and 10 -year Treasury rates) accurately predict directional change and thus are of value to a user. In exploring the view that the 30 -year mortgage rate often moves in tandem with the 10 -year Treasury rate, we further find that these rates are cointegrated and thus converge to an equilibrium relation in the long-run.

The paper then focuses on the theoretical foundation of the EMH, and show that market efficiency could co-exit with heterogeneous beliefs and individual irrationality so long as individual errors are cross sectionally weakly dependent in the sense defined by Chudik, Pesaran, and Tosetti (2010). But at times of market euphoria or gloom these individual errors are likely to become cross sectionally strongly dependent and the collective outcome could display significant departures from market efficiency. Market efficiency could be the norm, but {{it is likely to be}} punctuated with episodes of bubbles and crashes.

40|$|As part of {{the design}} of the Process and Environmental Technology Laboratory (PETL) in FY 97, an energy {{conservation}} report (ECR) was completed. The original energy baseline for the building, established in Title 1 design, was 595, 000 BTU/sq. ft. /yr, site energy use. Following the input of several reviewers and the incorporation of the various recommendations into the Title 2 design, the projected energy consumption was reduced to 341, 000 BTU/sq. ft. /yr. Of this reduction, it is estimated that about 150, 000 BTU/sq. ft. /yr resulted from inclusion of more energy efficient options into the design. The remaining reductions resulted from better accounting of energy consumption between Title 1 ECR and the final ECR. The energy efficient features selected by the outcome of the ECR were: (1) Energy Recovery system, with evaporative cooling assist, for the Exhaust/Make-up Air System; (2) Chilled Water Thermal Storage system; (3) <b>Premium</b> <b>efficiency</b> motors for large, year-round applications; (4) Variable frequency drives for all air handling fan motors; (4) <b>Premium</b> <b>efficiency</b> multiple boiler system; and (5) Lighting control system. The annual energy cost savings due to these measures will be about $ 165, 000. The estimated annual energy savings are two million kWhrs electric, and 168, 000 therms natural gas, the total of which is equivalent to 23, 000 million BTUs per year.

40|$|This paper builds an {{endogenous}} growth model whose {{purpose is to}} show how the inequality rise experienced by most OECD countries in the last 25 years may be linked to permanent changes {{in the structure of the}} product life cycle. Most recent papers interpret the inequality rise as the result of an increase of the skillpremium, notwithstanding the fact that 50 % of the inequality rise is residual (ie cannot be explained by observable differences). In order to account for the rise of both between-group and within-group inequality we make the assumption of a dual labor market. Each firm offers two kind of jobs: primary and secondary jobs. Primary jobs, which are located in the core activities of the firm, are paid an efficiency-wage premium, whereas the secondary jobs, located in the non essential activities, are paid the market clearing wage. Workers may have different skills, but the skilled ones may perform both kind of jobs. The <b>efficiency</b> wage <b>premium</b> paid to core workers is our measure of between-group inequality. This structure is embedded in an {{endogenous growth}} model where innovation triggers a two period product cycle. The key assumption is that new goods use (relatively) more core workers than old goods. This implies that both within-group and between-group inequality are linked to the pace of innovation and the structure of the cycle (i. e. the relative length of two periods). The inequality rise can be explained as the result of a series of changes in the product cycle that have increased the share of new, primary jobs-intensive, goods...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the possibility of}} enhancing <b>efficiency</b> by awarding <b>premiums</b> {{to a set of}} highest bidders in an English auction - in a setting that extends Maskin and Riley (1984, Econometrica 52 : 1473 - 1518) in three aspects: (i) the seller can be risk averse, (ii) the bidders can have heterogeneous risk preferences, and (iii) the auction can have a binding reserve price. Our analysis reveals that the premium has an intricate joint effect on risk sharing and expected revenue, which in general benefits risk averse bidders. When the seller is more risk averse than the pivotal bidder - a condition often verifiable by deduction prior to the auction - the premium also benefis the seller and therefore leads to a Pareto improvement of the English auction. The advantage of such premium tactics is directly related to (a) the seller's degree of risk aversion, (b) the reserve price, (c) the riskiness of the object for sale, (d) the degree of heterogeneity in risk preferences among the bidders, and (e) the number of the potential bidders...|$|R
