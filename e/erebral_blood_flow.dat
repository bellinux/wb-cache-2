BackgroundAn array of vasoconstrictor and vasodilator agents {{have the potential}} to control intrarenal circulation; however, their relative functional importance is unclear. We compared here the importance of nitric oxide and renal nerves in studies involving sequential blockade of nitric oxide synthesis and renal denervation. MethodsIn anesthetized rats, N-nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME) was used for nonselective inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis and 7 -nitroindazole (7 -NI) for inactivation of neuronal isoform of nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). Acute unilateral renal denervation was performed noninvasively enabling observation of rapid changes. Renal cortical and medullary <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> was determined by laser Doppler flowmetry. ResultsL-NAME decreased medullary <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> and cortical <b>blood</b> <b>flow,</b> by 22 % to 24 %, whereas after 7 -NI, medullary <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> decreased by 22 % and cortical <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> about 10 % (all changes significant). In untreated rats denervation significantly increased cortical <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> (10 % to 15 %) but not medullary <b>blood</b> <b>flow.</b> In rats treated with L-NAME denervation partly prevented the post-inhibitor decrease in cortical <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> but not in medullary <b>blood</b> <b>flow.</b> After 7 -NI treatment, the decrease in cortical <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> and medullary <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> did not occur or a partial restoration of flow was seen. The denervation natriuresis was intact under L-NAME but attenuated following 7 -NI. ConclusionA reduction of medullary <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> after 7 -NI, similar as after L-NAME, suggests that nitric oxide generated by nNOS is mainly responsible for adequate perfusion of the medulla whereas activity of nNOS and other isoform(s) is required to maintain cortical <b>blood</b> <b>flow.</b> Renal denervation partly restored cortical <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> reduced by nitric oxide blockade.

40|$|Regional {{cerebral}} <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> (rCBF) {{was measured}} with xenon-enhanced CT(Xe-CT) in 21 cases of intracranial tumors (13 meningiomas, 5 gliomas, 3 metastatic brain tumors). Peritumoral edema was graded as mild, moderate or severe based {{on the extent of}} edema on CT and MRI. According to intratumoral <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> distribution patterns, three patterns were classified as central type with relatively high <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> {{at the center of the}} tumor, homogeneous type with an almost homegeneous <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> distribution, and marginal type with relatively high <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> at the periphery of the tumor. High grade astrocytoma and metastatic brain tumor showed marginal type <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> and moderate or severe edema except in one case. Five meningiomas with severe peritumoral edema revealed marginal type <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> and four with mild peritumoral edema showed central type <b>blood</b> <b>flow,</b> except for one cace. No correlation was found between the extent of peritumoral edema and histological subtype, tumor size, locaton, duration of clinical history, vascularization on angiogram, and mean <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> in the tumor. These results suggest that <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> distribution patterns within the tumor may affect the extension of peritumoral edema. Pre-and postoperative rCBFs were evaluated with Xe-CT and IMP-SPECT in 7 cases. mean rCBF of peritumoral edema was 6. 2 ml/ 100 g/min preoperatively, and discrepancy between rCBF on Xe-CT and that on IMP-SPECT was shown in the remote cortical region ipsilateral to the tumor.

30|$|Under normal conditions, {{distribution}} of organ <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> {{is determined by}} local metabolic demands. For example, cerebral <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> increases in the cortex when the mind is actively thinking [9], and splanchnic <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> {{at the site of}} peristalsis and absorption increases after a meal [10]. Actively metabolizing tissues are thought to increase <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> by releasing vasoactive substances such as adenosine, a potent vasodilator [11].

Assessment of <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> may provide information about severity of the disease. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has potential use for simple, fast quantitative <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> measurement. We investigated normal <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> values for age and sex in the common femoral artery and popliteal artery in 50 healthy volunteers. In addition, we examined reproducibility and determinants of <b>blood</b> <b>flow.</b> MethodsWe performed cardiac-triggered phase-contrast quantitative flow measurements in the common femoral artery and popliteal artery, and MRI of the calves in 50 healthy volunteers (age, 26 - 80 years). Ten persons underwent MRI three times, to analyze reproducibility. ResultsAll measurements were technically successful. Mean <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> was 353 mL/min in the femoral artery and 61. 9 mL/min in the popliteal artery. Coefficient of variation of femoral measurements was 16 %, and of popliteal measurements was 19 %. Femoral <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> {{was significantly related to}} age and sex. Popliteal <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> was significantly related to calf muscle volume, adjusted for age and sex. ConclusionNormal values for <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> to the legs are presented.

An excellent correlation was found between regional spinal and epidural <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> over a physiological range of Paco 2 (27. 8 - 66. 7 torr) and blood pressure (30 - 130 torr), while a poor correlation was demonstrated between regional spinal or epidural <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> and regional muscle <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> {{in response to these}} same physiological parameters. Moreover, the rates of change in regional spinal and epidural <b>blood</b> <b>flows</b> were almost the same in response to both Paco 2 and blood pressure.

40|$|Measurement of resting <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> to {{the skin}} and other organs is an {{important}} indicator of health and disease {{and a way to}} assess the reaction to various stimuli and pharmaceutical interventions. However, unlike plasma ions such as sodium or potassium, {{it is difficult to determine}} what the proper value for resting <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> really is. Part of the problem is in the measurement of blood flow; various techniques yield very different measures of skin <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> even in the same area. Even if there were common techniques, resting <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> to tissue, such as the skin, is determined by the interaction of a plurality of factors, including the sympathetic nervous system, temperature, pressure, shear forces on blood vessels, tissue osmolality, and a variety of other stimuli. Compounding this variability, the <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> response to any stressor is reduced by free radicals in the blood and diminished by aging and diabetes. Race also has an effect on resting <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> {{to the skin}}. All these factors interact to make the exact resting <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> difficult to determine in any one individual and at any one time.

40|$|Purpose: We {{examined}} the xenon/CT method of measuring cerebral <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> {{in assessing the}} location, pattern of onset, and severity of delayed cerebral ischemia. Patients and Methods: Fourteen patients with delayed neurologic deficits due to ischemia were selected {{from a group of}} 66 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. All <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> studies were performed within 12 hours of deterioration and at regular intervals during medical management. Results: In 10 of the 14 patients, noncontrast CT did not identify a cause for deterioration, whereas the <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> study revealed diminished flow values. Location of <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> reduction was variable. In five of the 14 patients, <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> reduction was closely related anatomically to the vessel of aneurysm origin. In another three, <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> reduction was anatomically remote to the vessel of origin. The remaining six experienced local and remote cerebral <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> reduction. Six of 14 patients suffered sudden, devastating deterioration, refractory to therapy and associated with <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> of 15 cc/ 1 00 g ·min or less, resulting in local or widespread infarction. The remaining eight had less severe <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> reduction and did not infarct those territories. Conclusions: Vasospasm can affect remote vessels as severely as local vessels and can affect remote vessels alone. Diminished cerebral <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> correlated closely with clinical vasospasm in this group of patients.

40|$|Flow in {{hemodialysis}} grafts after angioplasty: Do radiologic criteria predict success?BackgroundThe anatomic {{success of}} percutaneous angioplasty of venous stenosis {{is determined by}} the improvement in cross-sectional diameter of the vessel. A successful outcome is defined as a residual stenosis of < 30 %. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether the angiographic assessment of a venous stenosis correlates with the change in graft <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> following angioplasty. MethodsTwenty-two hemodialysis patients with decreased intragraft <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> (< 700 mL/min) underwent diagnostic fistulography and angioplasty. All grafts were patent at the time of the procedure. Intragraft <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> was measured before and after angioplasty using the ultrasonic dilution technique. Change in graft <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> after angioplasty was correlated to the morphologic changes of the treated stenosis. ResultsThe mean preangioplasty and postangioplasty graft <b>blood</b> <b>flows</b> were 457 ± 136 and 818 ± 202 mL/min, respectively. The mean degree of stenosis before angioplasty was 74 ± 15 % and 18 ± 14 % after dilation (P < 0. 001). The only variable that significantly correlated with postangioplasty <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> was preangioplasty flow (r 2 = 0. 22, P < 0. 001). The postangioplasty <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> was not significantly different than the highest recorded <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> measured in that graft (798 ± 213 mL/min, P = NS). There was no significant correlation between the change in <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> and the change in percentage of stenosis. ConclusionFollowing angioplasty of a venous stenosis, the graft <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> is most closely predicted by the preprocedural <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> and is similar to the highest recorded <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> ever measured in that graft.
