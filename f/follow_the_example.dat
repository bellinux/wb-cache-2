5|$|There is a socio-political {{cycle of}} order and {{disorder}} where, regardless of who is in power, the same injustices take place: when the blacks take control, they betray their own traditions and <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> <b>example</b> of European states. By means of these repeated scenarios, history {{is presented as a}} cyclical re-enactment of the same human dilemmas.|$|E
5|$|A {{native of}} Van, {{one of the}} largest cities in Turkish (Western) Armenia, Khrimian became a celibate priest (vardapet) in 1854 {{after the death of his}} wife and daughter. In the 1850s and 1860s he served as the abbot of two {{important}} monasteries in Turkish Armenia: Varagavank near Van and Surb Karapet Monastery near Mush. During this period he established schools and journals in both monasteries. He served as Patriarch of Constantinople—the most influential figure within the Ottoman Armenian community—from 1869 to 1873 and resigned due to pressure from the Ottoman government which saw him as a threat. He was the head of the Armenian delegation at the 1878 Congress of Berlin. Returning from Europe, he encouraged Armenian peasants to <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> <b>example</b> of Christian Balkan peoples by launching an armed struggle for autonomy or independence from the Ottoman Turks.|$|E

5|$|In 1943 Barbirolli {{made another}} Atlantic crossing, {{avoiding}} {{death by a}} fluke: he changed flights with the actor Leslie Howard when the latter wished to postpone his own flight for a few days. Barbirolli's plane landed safely; Howard's was shot down. In Manchester, Barbirolli immediately set about reviving the Hallé. The number of players in the orchestra was down to about 30. Most younger players were serving in the armed forces, and to compound the shortage {{the management of the}} orchestra had ended the arrangement by which many of its players were also members of the BBC Northern Orchestra. The Hallé board resolved that its orchestra must <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> <b>example</b> of the Liverpool Philharmonic, which the Hallé's former conductor Malcolm Sargent had transformed into a full-time, permanent orchestra. Only four of the players shared with the BBC chose to join the Hallé.|$|E
5|$|As the Belgian forces, {{together}} with their French and British allies, were forced to retreat, Leopold decided that surrendering the army was the only viable course of action. On 24 May, as the government was leaving the country for exile in France, a group of ministers including Pierlot held a final meeting with Leopold at the Kasteel van Wijnendale. They called for him to <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> <b>example</b> of the Norwegian king, Haakon VII, and join them in exile {{as a symbol of}} continued resistance. Leopold refused, believing that as commander, he should surrender alongside his army, provoking real animosity. He also believed that, by leaving for France, the Belgian government would surrender its neutrality and become a puppet government. He also believed that, as a neutral power with no formal treaty of alliance with France or Britain, the Belgian army was not obliged to hold out as long as it possibly could if it incurred huge casualties and had no change of defending its own territory. On 28 May, after a brief attempt to form a new government of sympathetic politicians under Henri De Man and after denouncing Pierlot and his government, Leopold surrendered to the Germans and was made a prisoner of war.|$|E
5|$|When Maribor was established, some of {{the club}} {{officials}} were favouring the red and white colours, while the traditional colours of Branik were black and white. Because {{of the fact that}} many football teams in Yugoslavia wore red and white or black and white jerseys, most notably Red Star Belgrade and Partizan, Maribor officials decided for a new and fresh combination. They decided to <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> <b>example</b> of Fiorentina, which at the time {{was one of the most}} successful clubs in Europe, and their purple and white combination. Oto Blaznik, the first captain in history of the club, was the one who proposed the combination after seeing the Italian side play. Eventually, they changed the secondary colour to yellow. In July 2015, white replaced yellow as the secondary colour. Today, Maribor play their home matches in purple and away matches in white kits. Since July 2011, the club's kit manufacturer is Adidas.|$|E

25|$|Holloway was {{relieved}} as CINCNELM by Admiral Robert L. Dennison in March 1959.

After his retirement from the Navy, he served as Governor of the United States Naval Home in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from 1964 until 1966.|$|E
25|$|Creech Jones {{specialised}} in Colonial {{affairs in}} Parliament, {{especially those in}} Africa. In June 1936 he pressed the Government, which were encouraging colonies to set up memorials to King George V, to <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> <b>example</b> of Uganda {{and set up a}} technical educational institution. The Labour Party nominated him to the Colonial Office's Educational Advisory Committee in 1936, on which he served for nine years. In 1937, he was {{a founding member of the}} Trades Union Congress Colonial Affairs Committee, and in 1940 he founded the Fabian Colonial Bureau.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} part of Scouting education is the personal example of the leader. The Scout is impressed by the leader because of his age, his knowledge, and his position as a leader. If the leader is popular, leadership {{will be seen as}} an attractive goal, and the Scout will <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> <b>example</b> of the leader. The Scoutmaster living the Scout law will have more influence than one who simply talks about it. In the boys' eyes it is what a man does that counts and not so much what he says.|$|E

25|$|As a Liberal nationalist, Mommsen favored {{assimilation}} of ethnic minorities into German society, not exclusion. In 1879, his colleague Heinrich von Treitschke began {{a political campaign}} against Jews (the so-called Berliner Antisemitismusstreit). Mommsen strongly opposed antisemitism and wrote a harsh pamphlet in which he denounced von Treitschke's views. Mommsen viewed a solution to antisemitism in voluntary cultural assimilation, suggesting that the Jews could <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> <b>example</b> {{of the people of}} Schleswig-Holstein, Hanover and other German states, which gave up some of the special customs when integrating in Prussia.|$|E
25|$|Many {{objects in}} fiction <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> <b>example</b> of false antecedents or false consequents. For example, The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien {{is based on}} an {{imaginary}} book. In the Appendices to The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien's characters name the Red Book of Westmarch as the source material for The Lord of the Rings, which they describe as a translation. But the Red Book of Westmarch is a fictional document that chronicles events in an imaginary world. One might imagine a different translation, by another author.|$|E

However, on March 1, under the terms of the Protocol of Florence the town surrendered to the Albanian Gendarmerie. The Greek Prime Minister, Eleftherios Venizelos, immediately ordered the withdrawal and handover of the nearby region of Kolonjë to the Albanian units, before the population could join the uprising too. As a result, bishop Spyridon, who planned to become the head of the autonomy movement in this region, was arrested and expelled by the Greek authorities.|$|E

25|$|The Friend of Singa Award was {{the brain}} child of Vincent Lam, {{a member of}} the Singapore Courtesy Council in 1991 as a means to {{recognise}} courteous conduct by students, and to function symbiotically with the school's efforts to teach courteous behaviour within students as well. It was established with the hope that other students would see winners of the Friend of Singa Award as role models, and <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> <b>example</b> set by them as well. The award, opened to any school in Singapore, involved the nomination of a student from each school by recounting the respective student's act of kindness and courtesy. Among all the nominations, a student would then be chosen for the Most Courteous Student Award and 10 other students for Merit Awards.|$|E
25|$|In Final Fantasy X-2, Kimahri is {{depicted}} as the new Elder of the Ronso tribe. Kimahri's difficulties as chief comprise several playable missions, most notably involving a disagreement he has with a young Ronso named Garik, who desires to seek vengeance upon the Guado for the Ronsos killed by Seymour in the previous game as well as find two Ronso children, Lian and Ayde, who are in search of adventure {{and a way to}} fix Kimahri's broken horn. Eventually, Kimahri realizes that all Ronso should <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> <b>example</b> of Lian and Ayde in trying to find their own individual paths while working together to forge a better future for one another, and that he alone can not provide a single answer to what the future of the entire group should be.|$|E
25|$|Copenhagen's {{relatively}} well-developed bicycle {{culture has}} given rise to the term copenhagenization. This is the practice where other cities try to <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> <b>example</b> Copenhagen has set in recent decades, by moving from their own (often long-held) car-centric transport policies to those that attempt to greatly increase the number of journeys by bicycle; they do this by developing bicycle infrastructure and/or improving their current bicycle infrastructure just as Copenhagen has done and continues to do. An example of a city which has introduced bike lanes acknowledging inspiration from Copenhagen is Melbourne in Australia where kerbside bike lanes separated from moving and parked cars by a low concrete kerb are referred to as 'Copenhagen lanes'. The concept of Copenhagenization has been featured by CNNs Richard Quest in the Futures Cities series and on Al Jazeera's Earthrise series.|$|E
