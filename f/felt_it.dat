5|$|Growing up, Takako Matsu practiced {{piano and}} took vocal {{training}} as a child. Prior to releasing music, she acted in various television drama and plays. In 1996, she acted in the drama Long Vacation, which became very popular in Japan. At the wrap up party of the drama, {{the director of the}} series at that time heard her perform karaoke and suggested that she try singing. Although taken aback and hesitant at first, she later agreed, as she <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was not a chance that everyone received and because she liked singing; she <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> might work out somehow.|$|E
5|$|Jonny Santos, who is {{best known}} as the vocalist and {{songwriter}} for the Grammy Award nominated industrial metal group Spineshank was displeased with the direction the band was going in and <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> had 'run its course'. Santos <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was time to move on and left Spineshank, although he was unsure what direction he wanted with his music career. He would play with local bands and friends, while performing production and engineering duties in studios to 'pay the bills'. However, after leaving Spineshank, Santos lost everything and was basically homeless, 'couch surfing' from friend’s house to friend’s house.|$|E
5|$|After Crisis Cores release, Kitase {{expressed}} {{surprised at}} {{the quality of the}} cutscenes, {{to the point where he}} <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> could almost be a PlayStation 2 game. He also enjoyed the game's ending, surprised by how moving Zack's story became.|$|E
50|$|The very {{worst part}} was, after that surgery {{they had to}} take all my {{bandages}} off in this place called the whirlpool room. That was pure hell because <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> like they were just ripping my skin off. The pain wasn’t like anything I’ve ever <b>felt.</b> <b>It’s</b> so different from anything that I’ve ever felt happen to me on a skateboard. <b>It</b> <b>felt</b> like <b>it</b> was constantly burning, like I was still on fire.|$|R

Creative director Ralph Fulton cited Europe's [...] "fantastic driving roads, amazing environmental diversity, and just stunning vistas that {{you really want to}} explore" [...] as some of the major points in selecting it for Horizon 2. Fulton also noted that most of the recent open-world driving games were set in North America and that Southern Europe [...] "just <b>felt</b> fresh, <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> different, <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> new, and <b>it</b> was a gimme for us".|$|R

5|$|Donald Fagen of Steely Dan has {{favored the}} sound of the Rhodes over the Wurlitzer Electric Piano, because he <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was a {{technically}} superior instrument.

5|$|Harry Connick, Jr. as Dean McCoppin, a beatnik {{artist and}} junkyard owner. Bird <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> {{appropriate}} {{to make the}} character {{a member of the}} beat generation, as they were viewed as mildly threatening to small-town values during that time. An outsider himself, he is among the first to recognize the Giant as no threat.|$|E
3000|$|... “It was {{the first}} time (to have an oral English class) so I was worried at first but I <b>felt</b> that <b>it</b> was fun and that I would be able to pass. I got used to <b>it</b> and <b>felt</b> that <b>it</b> was fun to speak English.” [...]...|$|R
60|$|It {{was but a}} {{momentary}} look, inasmuch as she checked it, and said in her soft little voice, 'Oh, Mr John! Is it you?' But she <b>felt</b> what <b>it</b> had been, as he <b>felt</b> what <b>it</b> had been; and they stood looking at one another equally confused.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{some critics}} criticized [...] "the lack of vocals" [...] in the album. Consequence of Sound senior staff writer Dan Caffrey stated: [...] "Although MC Ride’s {{presence}} is definitely <b>felt,</b> <b>it’s</b> more in repeated phrases and abstract vocalizations than the nasty stream-of-consciousness rhymes from other Death Grips releases." ...|$|R

And <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> good. <b>It</b> <b>felt</b> good. <b>It</b> <b>felt</b> like being, frankly, appreciated. I was happy to go back to work." [...] Nimoy subsequently befriended Quinto. Although Quinto watched some episodes of The Original Series during breaks in filming, he said Nimoy was his main resource in playing Spock.|$|R

5|$|The {{dialogue}} between Sharon and Randy that would provoke significant attention was not scripted until Tuesday morning, less than 48 hours prior to broadcast, {{and was one}} of the last completed parts of the show.

5000|$|T.I. {{felt the}} song {{needed to reach}} more people so he had the song reworked, {{removing}} the sample: [...] "I rocked {{out as soon as}} I heard <b>it.</b> <b>It</b> <b>felt</b> relevant, <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> urgent. However, I was not able to work out a clearance. I didn't want to waste the opportunity because it was such a great performance and meaningful message from myself and B.o.B and Kendrick.”, T.I. said to Rap-Up.|$|R
5|$|The early 20th {{century was}} {{the era of the}} Great Migration of blacks from the Southern United States to the Northeast, Midwest and West.

5|$|The goal of {{his policy}} was to {{withdraw}} all the U.S. forces from Europe.

5|$|The reason I haven't {{spoken to}} you before now is this: You deserve the truth.

There's been enough of that.|$|E
