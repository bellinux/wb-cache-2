40|$|BACKGROUND: BK virus-associated hemorrhagic {{cystitis}} (BKV-HC) is {{a severe}} complication after allogeneic {{hematopoietic stem cell}} transplantation (HSCT), but antiviral treatment for this condition has not been evaluated. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective survey on the safety and outcome of cidofovir treatment for patients with BKV-HC in centers affiliated with the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation. RESULTS: From 1 April 2004 to 31 December 2007, 62 patients received a diagnosis of BKV-HC after a median interval of 35 days after HSCT (range, 3 - 577 days). Fifty-seven patients (92 %) received <b>intravenous</b> <b>cidofovir,</b> whereas 5 patients received cidofovir intravesically. Complete response (CR) was recorded in 38 (67 %) of 57 patients with HC treated with <b>intravenous</b> <b>cidofovir,</b> whereas partial response (PR) was documented in 7 patients (12 %). CR was documented in 3 patients and PR in 1 patient with HC treated with intravesical cidofovir. A reduction of 1 - 3 logs in BKV load was documented in 8 of the 10 patients achieving CR. Mild-to-moderate toxic effects were recorded in 18 of 57 patients who received <b>intravenous</b> <b>cidofovir</b> administration. In a multivariate analysis, the factors significantly associated with response to cidofovir were the stem cell source (P =. 01) {{and the use of}} total body irradiation (P =. 03).

Design: Incidence-based simulation model of CMV treatment from a government payer perspective. Setting: Swiss healthcare system. Patients and participants: Patients with AIDS and newly diagnosed CMV retinitis. Interventions: Patients were assigned to 1 of 4 treatment regimens for induction and maintenance therapy: 1. <b>intravenous</b> (IV) <b>cidofovir</b> induction and maintenance (cidofovir IV/IV); 2. IV foscarnet induction and maintenance (foscarnet IV/IV); 3. IV ganciclovir induction and maintenance (ganciclovir IV/IV); and 4.

Results: The median time to first progression was longest for cidofovir IV/IV, followed by foscarnet IV/IV, ganciclovir IV/IV and ganciclovir IV/PO. Mean survival was 13 months and mean costs for this period in the base case were lowest in those initially treated with cidofovir (SwF 146 742), followed by initial treatment with foscarnet IV/IV (SwF 194 809), ganciclovir IV/PO (SwF 195 190) and ganciclovir IV/IV (SwF 243 964).

40|$|AIM—Intravenous {{cidofovir}} is used {{to treat}} cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis, and {{has been reported to}} cause anterior uveitis. Relations were sought between this complication and patient characteristics that might help predict its occurrence.  METHODS— 17 patients with AIDS and CMV retinitis who were treated with <b>intravenous</b> <b>cidofovir</b> were identified, and the following data collected in a retrospective chart review: demographic characteristics, duration of CMV retinitis, retinal lesion characteristics, dose and duration of cidofovir therapy, tests of renal function, CD 4 + T lymphocyte counts, visual acuity, intraocular pressure, iris colour, history of diabetes mellitus, and use of concomitant medications. Case-control analyses were performed to determine risk factors for developing cidofovir associated uveitis.  RESULTS—Anterior uveitis characterised by pain, ciliary injection, and decreased visual acuity occurred in 10  patients (59 %). Median interval to development of uveitis was 11  doses of cidofovir. Symptoms developed 4. 4  (SD 2. 5) days (median 3. 5) after an infusion of cidofovir. Patients who developed uveitis had a significantly greater rise in CD 4 + T lymphocyte count while receiving cidofovir (68. 4  (75. 7) × 106 /l versus 5. 0  (0. 6) × 106 /l, (p =  0. 04)). By stepwise linear regression, this factor accounted for 33 % (p =  0. 03) of the effect of developing uveitis. Mean follow up time, intraocular pressure decline during cidofovir therapy, serum creatinine and urine protein concentrations, and rates of protease inhibitor use were not significantly different between patients who developed uveitis and those who did not. Uveitis responded to topical corticosteroids and cycloplegia.  CONCLUSION—Anterior uveitis in patients receiving <b>intravenous</b> <b>cidofovir</b> therapy may be related to improving immune function.

40|$|AbstractAdoptive {{immunotherapy}} with antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) {{has proven}} effective in restoring cellular immunity to cytomegalovirus (CMV) and preventing viral reactivation after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). In {{an effort to}} develop a cost-effective, relatively rapid method of CMV CTL expansion, we investigated {{the use of a}} pool of overlapping CMV peptides. Because the possibility exists of vaccinating CMV-seronegative donors, and these individuals may have T cell responses predominantly against IE- 1, commercially available peptide mixes for pp 65 as well as IE- 1 were used to stimulate CTLs from 10 seropositive donors. Of these 10 donors, 4 responded to pp 65 only, 1 did not respond to either pp 65 or IE- 1, 4 responded to both pp 65 and IE- 1, and 1 responded to IE- 1 only. These CMV- specific T cells included a mixture of CD 4 + and CD 8 + effectors, and specific cytotoxicity correlated with interferon-γ production. The costs associated with a 28 -day maintenance course of <b>intravenous</b> ganciclovir, <b>cidofovir,</b> foscarnet, and valganciclovir, as well as the preparation and shipping a single dose of CTLs, were determined. The price of generating CMV CTLs using this method was comparable to or less expensive than a 28 -day maintenance course for these agents, not including the costs associated with drug administration, supportive care, and the treatment of drug-related complications. Considering the relative ease, low cost, and the fact that CTL administration can result in CMV-specific immune reconstitution, this option should be considered for patients with CMV reactivation or for prophylaxis in patients at high risk for infection...|$|R
40|$|Human {{herpesvirus}} 6 (HHV- 6) infections {{occur in}} > 95 % of humans. Primary infection, which occurs {{in early childhood}} as an asymptomatic illness or manifested clinically as roseola infantum, leads {{to a state of}} subclinical viral persistence and latency. Reactivation of latent HHV- 6 is common after liver transplantation, possibly induced and facilitated by allograft rejection and immunosuppressive therapy. Since the vast majority of humans harbor the virus in a latent state, HHV- 6 infections after liver transplantation are believed to be mostly due to endogenous reactivation or superinfection (reactivation in the transplanted organ). In a minority of cases, however, primary HHV- 6 infection may occur when an HHV- 6 negative individual receives a liver allograft from an HHV- 6 positive donor. The vast majority of documented HHV- 6 infections after liver transplantation are asymptomatic. In a minority of cases, HHV- 6 has been implicated as a cause of febrile illness with rash and myelosuppression, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and encephalitis after liver transplantation. In addition, HHV- 6 has been associated with a variety of indirect effects such as allograft rejection, and increased predisposition and severity of other infections including cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis C virus, and opportunistic fungi. Because of the uncommon nature of the clinical illnesses directly attributed to HHV- 6, there is currently no recommended HHV- 6 -specific approach to prevention. However, ganciclovir and valganciclovir, which are primarily intended for the prevention of CMV disease, are also active against HHV- 6 and may prevent its reactivation after transplantation. The treatment of established HHV- 6 disease is usually with <b>intravenous</b> ganciclovir, <b>cidofovir,</b> or foscarnet, complemented by reduction in the degree of immunosuppression.

40|$|Proof-of-concept {{studies suggest}} that current defences against {{smallpox}} could be strengthened by supplementing vaccination with antiviral drug prophylaxis, based on aerosolized or orally available forms of the long-acting medication cidofovir. Delivery of aerosolized cidofovir to mice results in its prolonged retention in respiratory tissues and protection against lethal intranasal or aerosol poxviral challenge. Although cidofovir itself is not orally available, the addition of an alkoxyalkanol ether side-chain allows it to be absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. This also markedly increases its antiviral activity and lengthens its intracellular half-life from roughly 3 to 8 – 10 days. Oral treatment also pro-tected mice against lethal poxviral challenge. These results suggest that a single aerosol dose of cido-fovir (or an alkoxyalkanol–ether derivative) could provide prolonged protection against initiation of smallpox infection, whereas oral treatment could prevent both initiation of infection and internal dis-semination of virus.

30|$|Compared {{to other}} {{treatments}} for CMV retinitis, cidofovir has several advantages, including a long intracellular half-life [7]. However, it is rarely used today due to several important side effects, {{the most serious}} of which is potentially irreversible nephrotoxicity. In addition, cidofovir {{has been shown to}} induce a non-granulomatous anterior uveitis in 17 % to 89 % of cases and hypotony in approximately 10 % of cases [8 – 14]. These side effects occurred more frequently if patients received concomitant protease inhibitors, were previously treated for CMV retinitis, had chronic or recurrent retinitis, or had immune recovery [13]. Cidofovir-associated uveitis is more common following intravitreal administration and typically occurs after multiple injections, with a mean of 4.2 injections in one study [11]. Although nearly all cases of cidofovir-associated uveitis occur in the eyes with a history of active or treated CMV retinitis, there is one report in a patient with non-ocular CMV [15] and a second report of 5 of 14 patients treated with low-dose <b>intravenous</b> <b>cidofovir</b> for polyomavirus-associated nephropathy [16]. The incidence of ocular side effects decreases significantly with concomitant administration of oral probenecid, with one study reporting a decrease from 71 % to 18 % [8]. Probenecid is believed to inhibit intraocular secretion of cidofovir from the ciliary body, thereby minimizing its intraocular concentration [13]. Previously, the pathogenesis of cidofovir-associated uveitis was hypothesized to be due to a direct reaction with the CMV; however, uveitis has been {{associated with the use of}} cidofovir in non-CMV-related viral infections as well [16].|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Adenovirus {{infections are}} {{associated}} with significant morbidity and mortality among immunocompromised hosts. Adenovirus pneumonia is a rare and often fatal disease in patients with AIDS. Case Report: We report {{a case of a}} 28 -year-old woman with advanced HIV/AIDS, who developed pneumonia four weeks after initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Despite empiric antibiotics, the patient developed worsening hypoxemia and progressive pneumonia on chest x-ray. Culture data from a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was negative for bacteria, fungi, pneumocystis jirovecii, but was positive for adenovirus detected by PCR. After transfer to a tertiary care hospital intensive care unit, a repeat BAL confirmed the presence of adenovirus by immunohistochemical staining. Tissue samples sent for histopathology revealed "smudge cells". Serum adenovirus viral load was 1. 6 × 10 5 copies/mL. <b>Intravenous</b> <b>cidofovir,</b> 1 mg/kg/day, was initiated and scheduled three times a week. The patient exhibited remarkable improvement and was discharged to home in stable condition after four doses of cidofovir treatment. Discussion: Prior to our case, the few published accounts of HIV patients with adenovirus pneumonia treated with cidofovir have all resulted in death. Our case is distinct from these cases by the lack of concomitant pulmonary infection and the initiation of HAART prior to presentation. Conclusion: To our knowledge, we present the first case of adenovirus pneumonia in a patient with AIDS successfully treated with cidofovir.

40|$|Cytomegalovirus (CMV) {{is among}} the most com-mon {{opportunistic}} infections in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (1 - 3). In the era of prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, disease caused by CMV has been reported to affect as many as 45 % of patients with AIDS at some time during the course of disease (2). Although CMV may affect the eyes, gastrointestinal tract, lungs, and central nervous system, CMV ret-initis accounts for 85 % of all CMV disease in pa-tients with AIDS (3). Untreated CMV retinitis spreads through the retina and causes total retinal destruction and blindness (4, 5). Hence, CMV ret-initis is a major cause of morbidity in patients with AIDS. As of 1 May 1996, the treatments approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for CMV retinitis were intravenous ganciclovir, intrave-nous foscarnet, oral ganciclovir (for maintenance therapy), and the sustained-release ganciclovir in-traocular device. <b>Intravenous</b> <b>cidofovir</b> was recom-mended for approval by the FDA Antiviral Advi-sory Committee in March 1996 but has not yet received full approval. Systemically administered drugs for treatment of CMV retinitis are given in two steps: An initial high dose is given to control the infection (induction), and then a lower dose is given to prevent relapse (maintenance). Although it suppresses viral replication, treatment does not eliminate CMV from the retina (6); thus, discontin-uation of therapy results in prompt relapse of reti-nitis. Both intravenous ganciclovir (4, 5, 7) and in-travenous foscarnet (8) are effective for induction and maintenance therapy for CMV retinitis. Th...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of cidofovir (HPMPC; (S) - 1 -[3 -hydroxy- 2 -(phosphonylmethoxy) propyl]cytosine) {{were examined}} at five dose levels in three phase I/II studies {{in a total}} of 42 human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients (with or without asymptomatic cytomegalovirus infection). Levels of cidofovir in serum following intravenous infusion were dose proportional over the dose range of 1. 0 to 10. 0 mg/kg of body weight and declined biexponentially with an overall mean +/- standard deviation terminal half-life of 2. 6 +/- 1. 2 h (n = 25). Approximately 90 % of the intravenous dose was recovered unchanged in the urine in 24 h. The overall mean +/- standard deviation total clearance of the drug from serum (148 +/- 25 ml/h/kg; n = 25) approximated renal clearance (129 +/- 42 ml/h/kg; n = 25), which was significantly higher (P < 0. 001) than the baseline creatinine clearance in the same patients (83 +/- 21 ml/h/kg; n = 12). These data indicate that active tubular secretion {{played a significant role in}} the clearance of cidofovir. The steady-state volume of distribution of cidofovir was approximately 500 ml/kg, suggesting that the drug was distributed in total body water. Repeated dosing with cidofovir at 3. 0 and 10. 0 mg/kg/week did not alter the pharmacokinetics of the drug. Concomitant administration of <b>intravenous</b> <b>cidofovir</b> and oral probenecid to hydrated patients had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of cidofovir at a 3. 0 -mg/kg dose. At higher cidofovir doses, probenecid appeared to block tubular secretion of cidofovir and reduce its renal clearance to a level approaching glomerular filtration...|$|E
40|$|Recurrent {{respiratory}} papillomatosis (RRP) is {{a chronic}} {{and difficult to}} treat disease of the larynx. In 1998, the first article was published that described {{the use of the}} antiviral substance cidofovir to treat this disease. Although the results are promising, there remains some concern about the potential carcinogenicity of cidofovir. There is a demand for a qualitative review of the side-effects of this medicine. In this review, the side-effects of cidofovir are investigated. Special attention was given to the potential carcinogenicity of cidofovir. For this review a search is performed in PubMed and EMBASE for relevant articles in which the use of intralesional cidofovir for patients with RRP is described. Eventually, 31 articles could be included for this review. In these articles a total of 188 patients with RRP were described who underwent therapy with intralesional cidofovir. Five of these patients have developed dysplasia of the larynx during the treatment with cidofovir. This is a percentage of 2. 7. This percentage is concurrent with the incidence of spontaneous malignant degeneration of RRP (2 - 3 %). Based on this review, it can be concluded that the use of intralesional cidofovir does not increase the risk of laryngeal dysplasia. Apart from the articles that describe the intralesional administration of cidofovir, some articles have been published in which the use of <b>intravenous</b> <b>cidofovir</b> is described as a therapy for RRP. Therefore, a summary is given on the side-effects of intralesional cidofovir as well as a summary on the reported side-effects of the intravenous administration of cidofovir. Based on the outcomes of this review, recommendations are given for a safe use of cidofovir for treatment of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis in the future...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} and bioavailability of 1 -[((S) - 2 -hydroxy- 2 -oxo- 1, 4, 2 -dioxaphosphorinan- 5 -yl) methyl]cytosine (cyclic HPMPC) {{were examined}} at four doses in 22 patients with {{human immunodeficiency virus}} infection. Two groups of six patients received a single dose of cyclic HPMPC at 1. 5 or 3. 0 mg/kg of body weight by each of the oral and intravenous routes in a random order with a 2 -week washout period between administrations. Additional patients received single intravenous doses of cyclic HPMPC at 5. 0 mg/kg (n = 6) or 7. 5 mg/kg (n = 4). Serial serum and urine samples were collected at intervals over 24 h after dosing. The concentrations of cyclic HPMPC and cidofovir in serum and urine samples were determined by validated reverse-phase ion-pairing high-performance liquid chromatography methods with derivatization and fluorescence detection. After intravenous administration of cyclic HPMPC, concentrations of cyclic HPMPC declined in a biexponential manner, with a mean ± standard deviation half-life of 1. 09 ± 0. 12 h (n = 22). The pharmacokinetics of cyclic HPMPC were independent of dose over the dose range of 1. 5 to 7. 5 mg/kg. The total clearance of cyclic HPMPC from serum and the volume of distribution of intravenous cyclic HPMPC were 198 ± 39. 6 ml/h/kg and 338 ± 65. 1 ml/kg, respectively (n = 22). The renal clearance of cyclic HPMPC (132 ± 27. 3 ml/h/kg; n = 22) exceeded the creatinine clearance (86. 2 ± 16. 3 ml/h/kg), indicating active tubular secretion. The cyclic HPMPC excreted in urine in 24 h accounted for 71. 3 % ± 16. 0 % of the administered dose. Cidofovir was formed from cyclic HPMPC in vivo with a time to the maximum concentration in serum of 1. 64 ± 0. 23 h (n = 22). Cidofovir levels declined in an apparent monoexponential manner, with a mean terminal half-life of 3. 98 ± 1. 26 h (n = 22). The cidofovir excreted in urine in 24 h accounted for 9. 40 % ± 2. 33 % of the administered cyclic HPMPC dose. Exposure to cidofovir after intravenous administration of cyclic HPMPC was dose proportional and was 14. 9 % of that from an equivalent dose of cidofovir. The present study suggests that intravenous cyclic HPMPC also has a lower potential for nephrotoxicity in humans {{compared to that of}} <b>intravenous</b> <b>cidofovir.</b> The oral bioavailabilities of cyclic HPMPC were 1. 76 % ± 1. 48 % and 3. 10 % ± 1. 16 % with the administration of doses of 1. 5 and 3. 0 mg/kg, respectively (n = 6 per dose). The maximum concentrations of cyclic HPMPC in serum were 0. 036 ± 0. 021 and 0. 082 ± 0. 038 μg/ml after the oral administration of doses of 1. 5 and 3. 0 mg/kg, respectively. Cidofovir reached quantifiable levels in the serum of only one patient for each of the 1. 5 - and 3. 0 -mg/kg oral cyclic HPMPC doses...|$|E
