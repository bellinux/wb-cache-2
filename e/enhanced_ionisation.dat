In particular, the ionograms contain unusual traces at frequencies close to and above the conventional or basic maximum usable frequency, i. e. above the junction frequency of {{the high and low}} angle modes. A series of experiments have been undertaken {{over a period of several}} years to investigate off-great-circle propagation mechanisms over high latitude and sub-auroral oval paths. In addition to measurements of the signal direction of arrival, oblique ionograms were also recorded over several of the paths. By these means, the characteristic ionogram signatures associated with off-great-circle propagation effects arising due to the presence of convecting patches of <b>enhanced</b> <b>ionisation</b> or sun-aligned arcs within the polar cap ionosphere, or to the presence of steep gradients to the side of the path within the mid-latitude trough region, have been identified...|$|E

40|$|Triode {{discharges}} {{are widely}} used in plasma assisted physical vapour deposition techniques to <b>enhance</b> <b>ionisation</b> even under low pressures. In addition to this, the triode discharges enable independent control of substrate bias currents irrespective of bias voltage and pressure, compared to magnetron discharges. One of {{the problems associated with}} triode discharge is non-uniform distribution of plasma density. The extent of nonuniformity depends {{on the size of the}} chamber, characteristics of the thermionic filament, location of the electrodes with respect to one another, operating potentials at the electrodes, and pressure. Hence it is necessary to carry out the discharge studies to study space charge distribution in the chamber. A Langmuir probe is used in the present study, to estimate the density of ions and electrons for different triode discharge currents, substrate bias voltages, pressures and at different locations in the plasma in a triode ion plating system.

40|$|The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} evolution of a depleted atomic distribution created by laser <b>enhanced</b> <b>ionisation</b> (LEI) was employed to determine both a diffusion coefficient for sodium (Na) and an electron (e(-)) and sodium ion recombination rate coefficient in an analytical air-C 2 H 2 flame. A depleted distribution of neutral sodium atoms was produced in a flame by ionising approximately 80 % of the irradiated sodium atoms in a well defined region using a two step LEI excitation scheme. Following depletion by ionisation, planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) images of the depleted region recorded the diffusion and decay of the depleted Na distribution for different depletion-probe delays. From measurements of the diffused width of the distribution, an accurate diffusion coefficient D = (1. 19 +/- 0. 03) x 10 (- 3) m(2) s(- 1) for Na was determined in teh burnt gases of the flame. Measurements of the integrated fluorescence intensity in the depleted region for different depletion-probe delays were related {{to an increase in}} atomic sodium concentration caused by electron-ion recombination. At high concentrations (greater than or equal to 50 mu g ml(- 1)), where the electron and ion concentrations in the depleted region were assumed equal, a recombination rate coefficient of 4. 2 x 10 (- 9) cm(3) s(- 1) was calculated.

40|$|Analysis of the diurnal and {{seasonal}} variation of polar patches, as identified {{in two years}} of HF-radar data from Halley, Antarctica during a period near sunspot maximum, shows {{that there is a}} broad maximum in occurrence centred about magnetic noon, not local noon. There are minima in occurrence near midsummer and midwinter, with maxima in occurrence between equinox and winter. There are no significant correlations between the occurrence of polar patches and the corresponding hourly averages of the solar wind and IMF parameters, except that patches usually occur when the interplanetary magnetic field has a southward component. The results can be understood in terms of UT {{and seasonal}} differences in the plasma concentration being convected from the dayside ionosphere into the polar cap. In summer and winter the electron concentrations in the polar cap are high and low, respectively, but relatively unstructured. About equinox, a tongue of <b>enhanced</b> <b>ionisation</b> is convected into the polar cap; this tongue is then structured by the effects of the interplanetary magnetic field, but these Halley data cannot be used to separate the various competing mechanisms for patch formation. The observed diurnal and seasonal variation in the occurrence of polar patches are largely consistent with predictions of Sojka et al.

40|$|Supercritical fluid {{chromatography}} (SFC) is {{fast becoming}} a technique of choice {{for the analysis of}} a wide range of compounds and has been found to be complementary to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The combination of SFC and mass spectrometry (MS) affords a very useful tool in the separation and analysis of compounds. In this study the ionisation of samples in the absence of an applied electrospray voltage has been observed when using SFC/MS, with some compounds showing increased sensitivity when all ionisation source high voltage (HV) is removed. In an attempt to understand the mechanism of ionisation, a series of test compounds were analysed using standard electrospray ionisation (ESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation (APCI) source configurations and also different API source designs. In both cases, data were acquired with the applied high voltage on (normal conditions) or with the high voltage off, i. e. no voltage spray (novo-spray). The standards were analysed with a range of pressure and modifier percentage conditions. To understand the nature of the ionisation process observed, this was compared with three established liquid-to-gas ionisation mechanisms. These were thermospray (TSP), charge residue model (CRM) of ESI and sonic spray ionisation (SSI). Experiments were undertaken in an attempt to explain this ionisation phenomenon and quantify any observed change in sensitivity. The most important point to note is that <b>enhanced</b> <b>ionisation</b> was observed under novo-spray conditions in a SFC/MS configuration, which in certain cases provides a lowering in the overall limit of detection (LOD) ...|$|E

The processing procedure customary used was modified and further steps {{relating to the}} new {{plasma nitriding}} were added. In particular the total pressure during nitriding was reduced from 2 - 5 mbar, which is typical for pulse plasma nitriding process, to 5 - 10 x 10 (- 3) mbar. To <b>enhance</b> <b>ionisation</b> to a sufficiently high level the available four magnetrons were ignited at a low power level (0. 5 W/cm(2)).

Scratch test results showed a substantial enhancement of the critical load (L-C > 80 N) compared to un-nitrided coated samples (Lc similar to 50 N).

Nevertheless, this work is particularly difficult due to the wide dynamic range of protein concentration in eukaryotic tissues. In this paper, we present a shotgun method whereby the peptides are fractionated using OFFGEL electrophoresis after iTRAQ labelling. Results We demonstrated that iTRAQ peptide labelling <b>enhances</b> MALDI <b>ionisation</b> and that the OFFGEL fractionation of the labelled peptides introduces a supplementary criterion (pI) useful for validation and identification of proteins. We showed that iTRAQ samples allowed lower-concentrated proteins identification in comparison with free-labelled samples.

A simple Beam forming and some superresolution direction finding (SRDF) algorithms, Loaded Capon, Iterative Null Steering (INS) and MUSIC, were utilised to measure the azimuth, elevation and amplitude of this signal. The validity of the SRDF Spread Maximum Likelihood (SML) algorithm was tested. The array aperture and shape was changed by using 12 and 8 antenna arrays. The performance of the five algorithms was compared under {{a wide variety of}} propagation conditions.;The effect of the integration time and the time over which the estimates are averaged on the measurements has been evaluated. For a fixed integration time value, an increase in the time/average resulted in a decrease in the standard deviation of the bearing estimates for all algorithms and array geometries.;Simulations of <b>enhanced</b> <b>ionisation</b> structures (patches) drifting across the great circle path agreed well with the observed azimuth and elevation swings. The simulated trajectories were often consistent with the direction of the convection flow.;The behaviour of experimental observations was reproduced by two simulations. In the first, the effect of one signal spread in azimuth was studied. In the second, two spread signals were modelled with a variety of azimuth spreads, angular separation and relative amplitude. While Loaded Capon and INS were able to resolve the two spread signals at angular separations close to and above the signal spread, MUSIC succeeded for unspread signals only.;For Loaded Capon and INS secondary energy arose which closely tracked the stronger signal - a feature commonly observed in the data.

40|$|An {{experimental}} method is presented for assigning vibronic spectra of van der Waals molecules {{based on the}} measurement of the velocity- and mass-resolved resonance <b>enhanced</b> multiphoton <b>ionisation</b> (VMR-REMPI) spectrum. The basis of the technique is that at each wavelength one measures the velocity map image of the ions produced at a chosen mass. If this mass corresponds to the parent ion for the transition, the image shows a central spot only. However, if this mass is from a fragment ion, the image is enlarged due to the velocity gained by the ion during dissociation. VMR-REMPI spectra consist of plots of the integrated signal in an appropriate image area versus laser wavelength or frequency. The technique is demonstrated with two examples, benzene–acetylenen (n= 1 – 3) and p-difluorobenzene–Ar. Application of the technique to the former system leads to a reassignment of the spectrum.

The REMPI spectrum is assigned to the ClO(C 2 S 2, v’ ~ 0 B X 2 PV, v ~ 0) transition. The non-thermal population of rotational states is highly inverted, peaking at J ~ 107. 5. The photodissociation of Cl 2 O is a classical example for the pure impulsive model, {{as a consequence of}} the Cl 2 O mass distribution and a weak dependence of the upper potential energy surface on the bond angle.

In this thesis, the S 1 electronic states of monohalosubstituted benzene molecules and their deuterated isotopologues are investigated, using resonance <b>enhanced</b> multiphoton <b>ionisation</b> spectroscopy. The observed vibrational bands are assigned using the Mi nomenclature proposed by Gardner and Wright where ring localised vibrations {{having the same}} atomic motion are given the same label, allowing straightforward comparisons of vibrational motions across monosubstituted benzene molecules to be achieved.

As a consequence a new nomenclature, Di, for labelling the vibrational motions of para disubstituted benzene molecules is proposed in this work. The Di labelling scheme is based on the vibrations of the para difluorobenzene molecule.

The research has been carried out as part of a collaboration between the SOCAR and Reid groups at the University of Nottingham and also involved external research teams. The work combines the results from experiments employing several different spectroscopic techniques with theoretical calculations, which support the experimental data, assist in their interpretation and provide new information. Resonance <b>enhanced</b> multiphoton <b>ionisation</b> spectroscopy is employed to investigate the Au–Xe and Au–Ne neutral complexes in the region of the 62 PJ ← 62 S 1 / 2 Au atomic transition. High-level ab initio calculations provide further insight, which is necessary to explain the unusual spectra obtained. A theoretical study of complexes containing Group 2 metal cations and rare gases also reveals some unexpected trends that are related to some of the effects seen in the Au–RG series. A combination of nanosecond zero electron kinetic energy spectroscopy and time-resolved picosecond photoelectron spectroscopy is employed to investigate the vibrational dynamics of pFT.

Both, cis- and trans-isomers of formanilide, were observed under molecular beam conditions. Trans-formanilide displayed predominantly in-plane vibrational excitation indicative of a planar geometry with modest geometry changes upon excitation and ionisation. In cis-formanilide the side-chain is twisted compared to the phenyl plane in the S sub 0 state, but planar in the S sub 1 and D sub 0 states, revealed in characteristic side-chain torsional and out-of-plane bending excitations. Additionally, the ZEKE spectra provide evidence that excess cationic charge is delocalised from the aromatic ring to the side chain. The work on trans-formanilide was extended to its van der Waals complex with Argon {{with the purpose of}} investigating the torsional potential of the side-chain and probing charge delocalisation. Complexation of amides with water is of considerable interest since water is not only present as a bulk solvent surrounding a peptide but also attached to specific binding sites in its interior.

In this study, surface hardening of Ti 6 Al 4 V is achieved by Triode Plasma Oxidation (TPO) which differs from conventional diode plasma treatments through the use of a third electrode; a negatively biased tungsten filament to <b>enhance</b> the <b>ionisation</b> levels in the plasma. The resultant surface generally consists of a top oxide layer with an oxy- gen diffusion zone lying immediately underneath it. The effects of process parameters such as substrate tem- perature, current density and oxygen partial pressure have been investigated. Surface hardness measurements at various indentation loads were carried out to assess the changes in hardness with depth across the diffusion layer. The hardness profiles obtained confirmed the gradual decrease in hardness with treatment depth and provided an indication of the thickness of the hardened layer produced. Ball-on-plate reciprocating sliding wear data and glancing angle XRD analyses of the oxidised samples are also presented. The results indicate that a harder and deeper case is achieved at both high substrate temperature and high oxygen partial pressure.

The size of the Pd-aggregates was systematically varied between 5 Angstrom and 80 Angstrom. Different morphologies were chosen depending on the growth conditions of the aggregates by Pd-atom deposition on the support. The aggregates were either amorphous (deposition at 100 K) or ordered (deposition at 300 K) with the aggregates having a cubooctahedral shape with dominating (111) terraces and a minority of (100) terraces. Adsorption is only similar to single crystal data for aggregate sizes beyond 75 Angstrom. For smaller aggregates NO is bound on on-top sites of palladium. On small amorphous aggregates {{a substantial amount of}} NO is weakly bound, which has only been observed for stepped single Pd-crystals. Dissociation of NO occurs at elevated temperatures above 350 K. The system was excited with nanosecond laser pulses at 6. 4 eV.

It was found that dead space increases the order of carrier groups involved in multiplication, and hence the length of the multiplication chains, as impact ionisation events initiated by feedback carriers become more important. This degrades the improvement in bandwidth expected from reducing the multiplication layer thickness. To study the effects of <b>enhanced</b> speed to <b>ionisation</b> of early ionising carriers and of carrier diffusion on the avalanche time response, a technique has been developed for calculating the probability of fusion (pdf) of avalanche duration using general models for pdfs of ionisation in space and time and also for carrier transport. While diffusion plays only a minor role, the speed enhancement of carriers to ionisation events early in their trajectories is found to speed up the avalanche process significantly in short devices...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the essential design {{features of a}} guided-ion-beam experiment and then continues to report measurements of state-specific integral reactive cross sections for a selected set of ion-molecule reactions. Particular emphasis {{was given to the}} low end of the collision energy scale, which extends down to 10 meV in the center-of-mass frame. The preparation of the reacting ions was effected by resonantly <b>enhanced</b> multiphoton <b>ionisation</b> which allowed to select individual electronic and vibrational states, as proven by photoelectron time-of-flight spectrometry. This technique of excitation affords independent tunability of the kinetic energy, unrestricted by the particular quantum state that has been singled out. This characteristic represents a substantial advantage over schemes that rely on collisional relaxation, as do all flow tube experiments. The reaction products were identified with respect to their mass, while no attempt was made to label their quantum state. In particular, the following reactions were examined with respect to the influence of ionic quantum state and collisional energy: N"+_ 2 (#CHI#" 2 #SIGMA#"+_g,v"+ = 0, [...] , 4) + H_ 2 #-># N_ 2 H"+ + H (1) This process is exoergic. Additional reaction channels, though conceivable, have not been observed in this experiment. The close proximity of the ionisation potentials of the colliding molecules suggests to reckon with a near-resonant coupling between the two potential energy hypersurfaces, (N"+_ 2 + H_ 2) and (H"+_ 2 + N_ 2). Footing on this concept the reaction coordinate which sets out on the first surface is assumed to switch over to the second where it continues to evolve. A model based on this hypothesis plausibly reproduces the kinetic- and vibrational energy dependence of the cross sections that have been observedAvailable from FIZ Karlsruhe / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekSIGLEDEGerman...|$|R
40|$|We {{incorporate}} {{a contribution to}} reionisation from X-rays within analytic and semi-numerical simulations of the 21 -cm signal arising from neutral hydrogen during the epoch of reionisation. The relatively long X-ray mean free path (MFP) means that ionisations due to X-rays {{are not subject to}} the same density bias as UV ionisations, resulting in a substantive modification of the statistics of the 21 -cm signal. We explore the impact that X-ray ionisations have on the power spectrum (PS) of 21 -cm fluctuations by varying both the average X-ray MFP and the fractional contribution of X-rays to reionisation. In general, prior to the epoch when the intergalactic medium is dominated by ionised regions (H II regions), X-ray-induced <b>ionisation</b> <b>enhances</b> fluctuations on spatial scales smaller than the X-ray MFP. Conversely, at later times when H II regions dominate, small-scale fluctuations in the 21 -cm signal are suppressed by X-ray ionisation. However, our modelling also shows that the modification of the 21 -cm signal due to the presence of X-rays is sensitive to the relative scales of the X-ray MFP, and the characteristic size of H II regions. We therefore find that X-rays imprint a...|$|R
40|$|Proteomics is {{the branch}} of science {{concerned}} with understanding the expression, interactions and functions of proteins. Recent technical advances in the separation, analysis and identification of proteins combined with sophisticated bioinformatics, have allowed the technique {{to be applied to}} a multitude of diseases, including urological malignancies. Although two-dimensional gel electrophoresis combined with peptide mass fingerprinting has been the 'workhorse' of proteomics, other techniques such as Surface <b>Enhanced</b> Laser Desorption <b>Ionisation</b> Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS), Isotope Coded Affinity Tag (ICAT) and Stable Isotope Labelling by Amino-acids in Culture (SILAC), are amongst the emerging technologies showing great promise. Much of the previous studies into urological malignancies have been fuelled by the urgent need to identify accurate biomarkers for the diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of disease. The purpose of this review is to firstly give an overview of the basic concepts of commonly used proteomic techniques and to highlight their advantages and limitations. Secondly, the applications of these techniques to the study of urological malignancies (prostate, bladder and kidney) are reviewed. Finally, the future challenges faced by proteomics are discussed. © 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundFor cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) patients {{there is a}} lack of good assays of disease activity and response to new therapeutic interventions, including gene therapy. Current measures of airways inflammation severity are insensitive or non-specific. MethodsBronchoalveolar lavage fluid from 39 CF children and 38 respiratory disease controls was obtained at bronchoscopy and analysed by surface <b>enhanced</b> laser desorption <b>ionisation</b> time of flight (SELDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Recognized proteins were assessed for CF disease specificity. Individual protein identification of specific peaks was performed. Results 1277 proteins/peptides, > 4  kDa, were detected using 12 different surfaces and binding conditions. 202 proteins/peptides were differentially expressed in the CF samples (p< 0. 001), 167 up-regulated and 35 down-regulated. The most discriminatory biomarker had a mass of 5. 163  kDa. The most abundant, with a mass of 10. 6  kDa, was identified as s 100 A 8 (calgranulin A). ConclusionsThe application of SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry allows evaluation of proteins in BAL fluid avoiding the limitations of only analysing predetermined proteins and potentially identifying proteins not previously appreciated as biomarkers. Its application to {{cystic fibrosis}} should enable appropriate evaluation of evolving illness, of gene therapy and other new therapies...|$|R
40|$|The {{interstellar}} medium (ISM) is {{the region of}} space between stars, where star and planet formation occurs. Molecular hydrogen is vitally important to the chemistry that happens in the ISM, as it initiates most of the reactions. The molecules that result from these reactions act as a coolant for the huge molecular clouds that collapse to form stars. The abundance of molecular hydrogen in the ISM is too high to form through gas phase processes alone. The accepted formation mechanism for H_ 2 is via heterogeneous catalysis {{on the surface of}} interstellar dust grains. These dust grains make up approximately 1 % mass of the ISM and are carbonaceous or silicate in composition. The experiment presented in this thesis has been designed to probe ro-vibrational energy of nascent HD formed on an interstellar dust grain analogue. The experiment involves the use of two atom sources, to produce H and D atoms, ultrahigh vacuum chambers and cryogenic cooling to obtain conditions relevant to the ISM. The laser technique of resonance <b>enhanced</b> multiphoton <b>ionisation</b> (REMPI) is employed to state selectively ionise the HD, in order to investigate the internal energy of the newly formed HD when itdesorbs from the highly orientated pyrolitic graphite surface. The results are presented here and are compared to other theoretical and experimental studies; the astrophysical implications are discussed. Also included in this thesis is a study of the electron impact ionisation of OCS using pulsed time-of-flight in conjunction with a 2 -D coincidence technique. The experimentalset-up allows fragment ions to be formed by dissociative single, double and triple ionisation to be detected and quantified. The relative partial ionisation cross sections (PICS) and precursor specific relative PICS are derived as well as information on OCS^{ 2 +}. OCS is found in the atmospheres of Jupiter and Venus, where it may exist in a doubly charged state, OCS has been observed in the {{interstellar medium}}. ...|$|R
40|$|Bioprocesses for {{therapeutic}} protein production typically require significant resources to {{be invested in}} their development. This development could be improved with technologies that can elucidate the physicochemical properties of process stream components with small sample volumes in a rapid and readily performed manner. This {{is especially true in}} early phase development when material and established analytical methods are limiting. This thesis has investigated various process materials but was focussed mainly on those existing in an ApolipoproteinA-IM (ApoA-IM) process, produced using an Eschericia coli (E. coli) host. Using a mass spectrometric technique this project began by monitoring the product and contaminant during the ApoA-IM process and how this analytical approach compares to traditional analytical methods such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results showed that, unlike many other analytical methods, surface <b>enhanced</b> laser desorption <b>ionisation</b> mass spectrometry (SELDI-MS) can handle early process samples that contain complex mixtures of biological molecules with limited sample pre-treatment and thereby provide meaningful process-relevant information. The change in material during the flocculation/centrifugation stage of the process was then examined. When only a change in cellular debris was observed an existing methodology developed at University College London (UCL) was implemented to maximise cellular debris removal. The predictive scale down methodology enabled rapid optimization of the operating conditions for a flocculation followed with a centrifugation step using only small volumes (20 mL) of a high solids (20...|$|R
40|$|Edge Cloud 2 (EC 2) {{is a large}} {{molecular}} cloud {{with one of the}} largest galac-tocentric distances known to exist in the Milky Way. We present observations of the cloud and use these to determine its physical characteristics. We calcu-late a gas temperature of 20 K and a density of n(H 2) ∼ 10 4 cm− 3. Based on our CO maps, we estimate the mass of EC 2 at around 104 M ⊙ and continuum observations suggest a dust-to-gas mass ratio as low as 0. 001. Chemical mod-els have been developed to reproduce the abundances in EC 2 and they indicate that: heavy element abundances may be reduced by a factor of five relative to the solar neighbourhood (similar to dwarf irregular galaxies and damped Lyman alpha systems); very low extinction (AV < 4 mag) due to a very low dust-to-gas ratio; an <b>enhanced</b> cosmic ray <b>ionisation</b> rate; and a higher UV field compared to local interstellar values. The reduced abundances may be attributed to the low level of star formation in this region and are probably also related to the continuing infall of low metallicity halo gas since the Milky Way formed. Finally, we note that shocks from the old supernova remnant GSH 138 – 01 – 94 may have determined the morphology and dynamics of EC 2...|$|R
40|$|The {{technique}} of two-dimensional laser induced fluorescence (2 D-LIF) spectroscopy {{has been used}} to observe the van der Waals complexes fluorobenzene-Ar and fluorobenzene-Ar 2 in the region of their S 1 -S 0 electronic origins. The 2 D-LIF spectral images reveal a number of features assigned to the van der Waals vibrations in S 0 and S 1. An advantage of 2 D-LIF spectroscopy is that the LIF spectrum associated with a particular species may be extracted from an image. This is illustrated for fluorobenzene-Ar. The S 1 van der Waals modes observed in this spectrum are consistent with previous observations using mass resolved resonance <b>enhanced</b> multiphoton <b>ionisation</b> techniques. For S 0, the two bending modes previously observed using a Raman technique were observed along with three new levels. These agree exceptionally well with ab initio calculations. The Fermi resonance between the stretch and bend overtone has been analysed in both the S 0 and S 1 states, revealing that the coupling is stronger in S 0 than in S 1. For fluorobenzene-Ar 2 the 2 D-LIF spectral image reveals the S 0 symmetric stretch van der Waals vibration to be 35. 0 cm− 1, closely matching the value predicted based on the fluorobenzene-Ar van der Waals stretch frequency. Rotational band contour analysis has been performed on the fluorobenzene-Ar math transition to yield a set of S 1 rotational constants A′ = 0. 05871 ± 0. 00014 cm− 1, B′ = 0. 03803 ± 0. 00010 cm− 1, and C′ = 0. 03103 ± 0. 00003 cm− 1. The rotational constants imply that in the S 1 00 level the Ar is on average 3. 488 Å from the fluorobenzene centre of mass and displaced from it towards the centre of the ring at an angle of ∼ 6 ° to the normal. The rotational contour for fluorobenzene-Ar 2 was predicted using rotational constants calculated {{on the basis of the}} fluorobenzene-Ar geometry and compared with the experimental contour. The comparison is poor which, while due in part to expected saturation effects, suggests the presence of another band lying beneath the contour...|$|R
