5|$|On 21 April 2005, Oneworld {{became the}} first airline {{alliance}} to enable its customers to fly throughout its members' network on electronic tickets (e-tickets) only, with the completion of <b>interline</b> e-ticketing (IET) links between all its member airlines.|$|E
5|$|Through the mid-2000s, EVA Air's {{route network}} was {{affected}} by the political status of Taiwan, which has historically limited access for Taiwanese airlines to Europe and certain Asian countries. Because Taiwanese carriers did not have direct access to China, EVA Air has used Hong Kong, Bangkok and Macau as <b>interline</b> destinations. EVA Air operated regular charter flights to China in 2008. The airline began regularly scheduled, direct cross-strait operations in December 2008, following the restoration of direct travel links.|$|E
5|$|In August 1992, Greyhound {{canceled}} its {{bus terminal}} license (BTL) agreements with other carriers at 200 terminals, and imposed {{the requirement that}} Greyhound be the sole-seller of the tenant's bus tickets within a 25-mile radius of such a Greyhound terminal. In 1995, The United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division brought suit to stop this practice, alleging {{that it was an}} illegal restraint of trade, bad for consumers, and reduced competition. In February 1996, the United States won its case, and Greyhound agreed to permit its tenants to sell tickets nearby and permit its tenants to honor <b>interline</b> tickets with competitors.|$|E
50|$|A few service {{changes were}} made to improve on-time {{performance}} on certain routes. Routes 1 and 3 were no longer <b>interlined,</b> although Route 1 is still <b>interlined</b> with Route 32. Routes 14 and 34 were <b>interlined</b> to improve the former route's on-time performance. Route 25 was split into two routes; Route 25 and Route 27, due to poor on-time performance on weekday afternoons and on weekends. Routes 25 and 27 remained <b>interlined</b> for weekday service until 1 PM, when the routes start to operate alone and an additional bus is added to Route 25. For weekday evening and weekend service, Route 25 is <b>interlined</b> with Route 5, and Route 27 is <b>interlined</b> with Route 7.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This study aims {{to analyze}} {{the changes in the}} {{mechanical}} properties of woven fabrics(cotton, linen, wool, silk, and polyester) by bonding fusible interlinings with varying deniers(10 D, 20 D, and 30 D) for a 3 D virtual try-on system(one that a user to try garments through screens using Avatar) developed over the last decade. We experimented with four mechanical properties and thicknesses of twenty-three specimens of <b>interlining</b> bonded fabrics including face fabrics and interlinings by using the KES-FB-AUTO system. The results showed that the tensile property increased(LT and RT increased and WT decreased) as the denier of the <b>interlining</b> increased; however, the change was slight. In contrast, the bending and shear properties increased significantly as the denier of the <b>interlining</b> increased on both the warp and the weft. This showed evidence that the <b>interlining</b> gives the fabrics size stability. The compression property was slight changed as the tensile property varies depending on the fibers and the denier of <b>interlining.</b> As expected, the thickness increased by bonding the <b>interlining</b> as the denier of <b>interlining</b> increased. From these results, we conclude that 3 D users need to reflect these changes of woven fabrics by bonding interlinings when they try screen fittings to accurately express the fabric reality of manufactured garment. Key words: woven fabric, mechanical properties, <b>interlining,</b> 3 D virtual try-on system 1...|$|R

25|$|In {{parallel}} to the forensic work, detectives were also tracing the origin of every piece of luggage that had been checked onto PA 103, either in London or through the <b>Interline</b> baggage system. <b>Interline</b> baggage is baggage checked onto a flight in one location and automatically routed by the airline to other locations. It is the weak link in airline security, because provided it is tagged correctly a bag not properly x-rayed by a low-risk airline in a low-risk airport may be routed without further checks through several other airports to high-risk airlines.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, Taguchi robust design {{methods were}} applied for {{optimization}} a fusing process conditions {{to maximize the}} bonding strength between a fabric and a fusible <b>interlining</b> before and after laundering process. Four parameters, including type of fusible <b>interlining,</b> fusing temperature, pressure, and time were selected to optimize the quality of fused textile system. Nine experiments were performed {{with respect to the}} L 9 orthogonal design for the Taguchi method. The results show a considerable improvement in the S/N ratio as compared to the initial condition. Taguchi method proved convenient in determining the optimum fusing conditions for the maximization of the bonding strength.

40|$|Electromagnetic {{interference}} (EMI) {{have become}} very serious {{in a variety of}} different electronic equipments, such as personal computers (frequency at several GHz), mobile devices (0. 9 – 2. 4 GHz) and similar. This imposes the need for setting boundaries for EM emission of electric and electronic devices in order to minimize the possibility of interference with radio and wireless communications. Functional textiles can offer protective properties against EM radiation. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the degree of protection against EM radiation provided by polyamide copper-coated <b>interlining</b> fabric before and after dry cleaning treatment. EM protection efficiency of the <b>interlining</b> functional fabric is explored on both sides at the frequencies of 0. 9; 1. 8; 2. 1 and 2. 4 GHz. The results obtained have shown that the <b>interlining</b> fabric has good protective properties against EM radiation, but after dry cleaning, treatment reduction is observed. Scanning electron microscopy micrographs of the <b>interlining</b> surface confirms shield effect decline due to degradation and firing of the copper layers during the process of dry cleaning...|$|R

25|$|At its {{inception}} in 2000, Virgin Blue did not have <b>interline</b> or marketing alliances with other airlines. However, {{after the collapse of}} its domestic competitor Ansett Australia, it began a codeshare agreement with United Airlines. This allowed United customers to fly from the United States to any of Virgin Blue's Australian destinations that United did not already serve. In 2006, in an effort to compete with Qantas, Virgin Blue started exploring these relationships, forming frequent flyer agreements with Emirates, Hawaiian Airlines and Malaysia Airlines. Virgin Blue also has an <b>Interline</b> Agreement with Regional Express Airlines for travellers to and from smaller regional centres in the eastern states of Australia, and operates its own two routes with Virgin Australia Regional Airlines in Western Australia. In November 2007, the airline announced an agreement with Garuda Indonesia, offering easy transfer from a domestic Virgin Blue flight to an international Garuda service departing from Perth, Melbourne, Sydney or Darwin. Since then Virgin Blue has also announced an agreement with Vietnam Airlines which allows passengers to fly from Melbourne and Sydney and connect with Vietnam Airlines's destinations through its flight network.|$|E
