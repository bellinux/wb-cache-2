40|$|This {{study is}} Research and Development (R & D). The {{subjects}} of the research were the 3 rd semester students of <b>Informatics</b> <b>Engineering</b> Education program in the academic year of 2013 / 2014 at Yogyakarta State University. The data collection {{was carried out by}} employing questionnaires. The data were analyzed using quantitative data analysis. The objectives of this research are (1) to identify the target needs of the 3 rd semester students of <b>Informatics</b> <b>Engineering</b> Education program atYogyakarta State University in learning English, (2) to identify the learning needs of the 3 rd students of <b>Informatics</b> <b>Engineering</b> Education program at Yogyakarta State University in learning English, (3) to develop the appropriate English learning materials for the 3 rd semester students of <b>Informatics</b> <b>Engineering</b> Education program at Yogyakarta State University. 	Based on the research findings, the students learn English because they want to get equipped with sufficient knowledge of language function used in <b>informatics</b> <b>engineering</b> context. Most of the students were at the level of beginner in terms of proficiency level. For the learning needs, most of the students wants dialogue related to the topic of the unit and the same text as given for the example as the input. For the learning activities, they like to answer comprehensive questions, read dialogue, role play and write a text. The appropriate English learning materials for the students of <b>Informatics</b> <b>Engineering</b> Education program are developed into three units, each unit consists of 20 - 23 tasks. Every unit consists of several sections, namely introduction task, main task and reinforcement. For unit 1, the topic is jobs which consists of 23 tasks. The second unit, the social media is the topic and consists of 20 tasks. The last unit, the topic is work place and consists of 21 tasks...|$|R

40|$|Biomedical <b>informatics,</b> imaging, and <b>engineering</b> {{are major}} forces driving the {{knowledge}} revolutions that are shaping the agendas for biomedical research and clinical {{medicine in the}} 21 st century. These disciplines produce the tools and techniques to advance biomedical research, and continually feed new technologies and procedures into clinical medicine. To sustain this force, an increased investment is needed in the physics, biomedical science, engineering, mathematics, information science, and computer science undergirding biomedical <b>informatics,</b> <b>engineering,</b> and imaging. This investment should be made primarily through the National Institutes of Health (NIH). However, the NIH is not structured to support such disciplines as biomedical <b>informatics,</b> <b>engineering,</b> and imaging that cross boundaries between disease- and organ-oriented institutes. The solution to this dilemma {{is the creation of}} a new institute or center at the NIH devoted to biomedical imaging, <b>engineering,</b> and <b>informatics.</b> Bills are being introduced into the 106 th Congress to authorize such an entity.
