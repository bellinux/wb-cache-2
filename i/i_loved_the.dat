5|$|<b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> Spitfire {{in all of}} {{her many}} versions. But I {{have to admit that}} the later marks, {{although}} they were faster than the earlier ones, were also much heavier and so did not handle so well. You did not have such positive control over them. One test of manoeuvrability was to throw her into a flick-roll and see how many times she rolled. With the Mark II or the Mark V one got two-and-a-half flick-rolls but the Mark IX was heavier and you got only one-and-a-half. With the later and still heavier versions, one got even less. The essence of aircraft design is compromise, and an improvement {{at one end of the}} performance envelope is rarely achieved without a deterioration somewhere else.|$|E

50|$|In 2002, VH1 {{broadcast}} a ten-part series entitled <b>I</b> <b>Love</b> <b>the</b> '80s. The series {{was adapted from}} a BBC series, first broadcast in 2000, in which current entertainers and pop-culture figures offered their take on the trends, events, and personalities of another decade. The success of VH1's <b>I</b> <b>Love</b> <b>the</b> '80s, coupled with the growing nostalgia for ever-more-recent times, led the network to create a parade of similarly themed programs. These ranged from 2003's <b>I</b> <b>Love</b> <b>the</b> '70s, to further variants like <b>I</b> <b>Love</b> <b>the</b> '80s Strikes Back, <b>I</b> <b>Love</b> <b>the</b> '90s, and <b>I</b> <b>Love</b> <b>the</b> '90s: Part Deux. More recently, VH1 premiered <b>I</b> <b>Love</b> <b>the</b> '80s 3-D and <b>I</b> <b>Love</b> <b>the</b> '70s: Volume 2. So eager was the network {{to capitalize on the}} trend while it was hot, that it devoted a series to the 2000s, {{despite the fact that the}} decade had not yet ended (<b>I</b> <b>Love</b> <b>the</b> New Millennium, broadcast in 2008, covered only the years 2000-2007). This was thought to be final installment of the series until 2014, when <b>I</b> <b>Love</b> <b>the</b> 2000s continued the format.|$|R

500|$|I {{spent a lot}} of {{time after}} [...] left the studio {{tightening}} up the rough. In fact, I'm sure she let me mix it just because <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> track so much! I mixed this in the fantastic penthouse room in Jungle City. This record was, of course, about the vocals — but a lot of it was about the production elements too. Everything had to be audible; there's some interesting percussion, and the hook had to feel nice and big.|$|E
500|$|Howard Blake recalls: [...] "I {{went to a}} {{viewing and}} saw that the film was very profound, with a serious anti-war theme, but a certain amount of 'found' choral music had already been laid in by the editors...I {{explained}} that <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> film and I thought the choral/orchestral music worked brilliantly but it was very big and rich and I felt a score would have to emerge from it and be very pure and expressive and quite small — and that I could only hear this in my head as done by strings only." ...|$|E

Conversely, Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "B+".|$|E
500|$|Along with The Dark Knight Returns, Tim Burton has {{mentioned}} that The Killing Joke influenced his film adaptation of Batman: [...] "I {{was never a}} giant comic book fan, but I've always loved the image of Batman and the Joker. The reason I've never been a comic book fan — and I think it started when I was a child — is because I could never tell which box I was supposed to read. I don't {{know if it was}} dyslexia or whatever, but that's why <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>The</b> Killing Joke, because for the first time I could tell which one to read. It's my favorite.

500|$|Volk {{enrolled}} at the University of Michigan in 1963. His decision to attend Michigan rather than Ohio State was influenced by family ties, including Bob Chappuis, who was Volk's uncle and {{finished second in the}} Heisman Trophy voting while playing for the undefeated 1947 Wolverines. Volk noted:"I had all these stories growing up. He [...] was my hero, so I always wanted to go to Michigan. ... And I didn't like Woody [...] anyway.

I've worked with some people that you've had to coax the performance out of them. With Courtney, there was no attitude. She was gonna give it all. And she did and it was really impressive to me... <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> whole band; they were a lot of fun. That early lineup of Hole—I felt they were the real deal.

[...] Malone notes that she rarely appeared in an interview without mentioning this fact. O'Hara was disconcerted with Ford's harsh treatment of Wayne during the production and constant ribbing.

So {{as soon as the}} movie came on, it was like familiar, things that my pop seen and my uncles seen and, you know, different things like that, things I've seen growing up. So they resonated with me in a way, the story, as well as, I mean, even though everything happens, you know, the way it turns out, you know, it's one of those movies that where you champion the bad guy, because the bad guy, you know, he don't seem like a bad guy, and the good guy — I mean the good guys are bad. You know, that complex — the complexity of human beings in this thing was amazing to me. <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> complexity of the human beings".|$|E
500|$|The Huffington Post Michael Pascua praised Dempsey's character, in {{comparison}} to his performance in [...] "Good Mourning", writing: [...] "Derek was set up as a real character in the second half, not just a one-sided McDreamy. First, Arizona and Derek finally fix the problem with Andy, then the two had some genuine interaction. Derek confronted Alex about his problems with Izzie. He {{took a moment to}} talk to Mark about the hospital's situation and ended the episode by confronting a very edgy Bailey. Miraculously, he had the time {{to have a lot of}} sex with Meredith." [...] Pascua also enjoyed Leigh's performance, commenting: [...] "Lexie continued to evolve. <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> anxiety that Lexie had with Callie. She wasn't really a doctor in any sense in this episode, just a friend to lean on." [...] Though he was impressed with the majority of the episode, Pascua had mixed feelings on the character of Stevens, attributing it to his dislike of Heigl.|$|E
