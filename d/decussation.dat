2500|$|Enamel tufts do not {{normally}} lead to enamel failure, due to these defects stabilizing potential fractures. The processes involved include them creating ‘‘stress shielding’’ by increasing [...] the compliance of enamel [...] {{next to the}} dentin. <b>Decussation</b> is another factor by which cracks form wavy stepwise extensions that arrest their further development. Enamel tufts also self-heal {{through a process of}} being filled with protein rich fluids. Odontologically they can be filled by light-cured composite resin when applied in two applications.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{multiple}} theories that explain {{the outcome of}} allochiria. [...] The current and most widely accepted explanation of allochiria is Hammond's Theory. [...] This theory assumes {{that there is an}} almost complete <b>decussation</b> of sensory fibers within the grey matter. [...] He concludes that with a lesion on one posterior side, this would reach center in the corresponding hemisphere, and thus, the sensation is then referred by this hemisphere to {{the opposite side of the}} body. Hammond goes on to say that if another unilateral lesion supervened at a different level from the first, the sensation that was previously deflected to the wrong hemisphere was now redirected by meeting with another obstacle and so arrived at its proper hemisphere. [...] Allochiria occurs equally with [...] and [...] lesions as long as they are asymmetrical. Another theory is Huber's theory which assumes that an appearance of a new lesion on the opposite side from that of the block redirecting the impulse towards its original destination. Disappearance of symptoms due to retrogression of the lesion and track are cleared.|$|E

30|$|BPA {{expands the}} {{brainstem}} and is {{typically associated with}} an exophytic growth, usually from its dorsal surface [20, 31]. It is characterised by sharp margins with cyst-like areas. The dorsal extension {{is a result of}} the inability of the low-grade tumour to infiltrate caudally below the <b>decussations</b> of the corticospinal tracts and medial lemnisci at the craniocervical junction. Therefore, dorsally exophytic tumours should be considered focal BSTs. However, ventral exophytic PAs have also been observed. Diffusely infiltrative brainstem gliomas are usually fibrillary astrocytomas located in the ventral pons, which present with abducens palsy, often engulf the basilar artery, and are associated with a grim prognosis [32]. Symptoms and signs are usually related to increased intracranial pressure. Nausea, vomiting, and ataxia with evidence of torticollis, papilledema, and nystagmus palsies of the sixth and seventh cranial nerves are usually observed at physical examination.|$|R
40|$|Joubert {{syndrome}} is a genetically heterogeneous disorder. The diagnostic criteria include episodic hyperventilation, abnormal eye movements, psychomotor retardation, hypotonia, ataxia, and the characteristic neuro-imaging findings (molar-tooth sign). Many of these clinical features {{have been observed}} in new-borns with mitochondrial disorders as well. Congenital brain malformations, including cerebellar hypoplasia, have been described in pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency. Malformations of the vermis and the cerebellar peduncles, {{with the lack of}} axonal <b>decussations,</b> however, are characteristic for Joubert syndrome but unique in patients with mitochondrial disorders. Here, we describe a child with Joubert syndrome presenting with primary lactic acidemia, decreased pyruvate oxidation rates, decreased ATP production, and a mildly decreased pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity measured in a fresh muscle biopsy. Sequence analysis of the PDHc E 1 alpha gene and the PDHX genes revealed no mutations. The patient received continuous feeding through a feeding tube for two years and showed a significant clinical improvement with a complete resolution of the chronic lactic acidemia. A second muscle biopsy revealed significantly decreased pyruvate oxidation rates and ATP production, but a normal pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity. We suggest that the described mitochondrial dysfunction in our patient is secondary to an underlying mutation leading to Joubert syndrome. status: publishe...|$|R
2500|$|Nerve fibres in the corticospinal tract {{originate}} from pyramidal cells in layer V of the cerebral cortex. Fibres {{arise from the}} primary motor cortex (about 30%), supplementary motor area and the premotor cortex (together also about 30%), and the somatosensory cortex, parietal lobe, and cingulate gyrus supplies the rest. The cells have their bodies in the cerebral cortex, and the axons form {{the bulk of the}} pyramidal tracts. [...] The nerve axons travel from the cortex through the posterior limb of internal capsule, through the cerebral peduncle and into the brainstem and anterior medulla oblongata. Here they form two prominences called the medulla oblongatary pyramids. Below the prominences, the majority of axons cross over to the opposite side from which they originated, known as <b>decussation.</b> The axons that cross over move to the outer part of the medulla oblongata and form the lateral corticospinal tract, whereas the fibres that remain form the anterior corticospinal tract. [...] About 80% of axons cross over and form the lateral corticospinal tract; 10% do not cross over and join the tract, and 10% of fibres travel in the anterior corticospinal tract.|$|E

40|$|The {{musculature}} of the ureter has a {{layered arrangement}} {{in which the}} internal layer is mainly longitudinal and the external layer is largely circular. There is, however, intermingling and migration of fascicles between layers. At {{the passage of the}} ureter through the bladder wall this layering is lost and all fascicles become oriented longitudinally. At the ureterovesical junction fibers of the detrusor muscle of the bladder, interspersed with delicate connective tissue, reflect onto the ureter over a distance to 2 to 3 cm. This “sheath” of the ureter, as it has been designated, is a reflection of bladder wall muscle onto the ureter. At its passage through the bladder wall, the ureter is loose and an injectable space exists around it. This is properly termed “Waldeyer's separation” since he called attention to it in 1892. Within the bladder, the ureteric wall flattens and widens, allowing the lumen to migrate to the surface to constitute the ureteral aperture at the angle of the vesical trigone. Delicate muscular <b>decussations</b> occur proximal and distal to the aperture. Ureteric muscle mainly forms the vesical trigone. Most fascicles run to the midline and blend with those of the opposite side in the interureteric fold. Others spread through the trigone, its lateral margin being formed of somewhat more numerous fascicles directed toward the vesical orifice. Very few fibers actually descend into the urethra. The principal fixation of the ureter into the bladder is to the mucous membrane of the trigone area and to the deeper lying muscle and connective tissue...|$|R
40|$|Tooth enamel {{microstructure}} is {{a reliable}} and widely used indicator of dietary interpretations and data for phylogenetic reconstruction, if all levels of variability are investigated. It is usually difficult to have a thorough examination {{at all levels of}} enamel structures for any mammals, especially for the early mammals, which are commonly represented by sparse specimens. Because of the random preservation of specimens, enamel microstructures from different teeth in various species are often compared. There are few examples that convincingly show intraspecific variation of tooth enamel microstructure in full dentition of a species, including multituberculates. Here we present a systematic survey of tooth enamel microstructures of Lambdopsalis bulla, a taeniolabidoid multituberculate from the Late Paleocene Nomogen Formation, Inner Mongolia. We examined enamel structures at all hierarchical levels. The samples are treated differently in section orientations and acid preparation and examined using different imaging methods. The results show that, except for preparation artifacts, the crystallites, enamel types, Schmelzmuster and dentition types of Lambdopsalis are relatively consistent in all permanent teeth, but the prism type, including the prism shape, size and density, may vary in different portions of a single tooth or among different teeth of an individual animal. The most common Schmelzmuster of the permanent teeth in Lambdopsalis is a combination of radial enamel in the inner and middle layers, aprismatic enamel in the outer layer, and irregular <b>decussations</b> in tooth crown area with great curvature. The prism seam is another comparably stable characteristic that may be a useful feature for multituberculate taxonomy. The systematic documentation of enamel structures in Lambdopsalis may be generalized for the enamel microstructure study, and thus for taxonomy and phylogenetic reconstruction, of multituberculates and even informative for the enamel study of other early mammals...|$|R
40|$|Radial glial {{cells and}} their {{processes}} play critical roles in organizing the spatial {{arrangement of the}} nervous system in the embryonic brain. It has been thought that following completion of their roles in the embryo, most of the radial glial processes disappear before or shortly after birth. Here we use R 2 D 5, a monoclonal antibody to a soluble cytosolic protein, to demonstrate that a specific system of midsagittal radial glial cells persists in postnatal and adult brain. In the brainstem of postnatally developing and adult rabbits and cats, the R 2 D 5 -positive processes of radial glial cells were observed to be arranged in a precisely parallel array at the midsagittal seam. These radial glial processes formed a continuous palisade separating the right and left brainstem. In early postnatal animals, R 2 D 5 -positive radial processes were found to reach the pial surface and to cover the entire midsagittal seam of the brainstem. These processes embraced dendrites and somata of neurons in almost all of the midsagittal nuclei, including the raphe nuclei, suggesting that the radial glial cells may interact with the midsagittal groups of neurons. In addition, the palisade of R 2 D 5 -positive radial processes formed loose openings for crossing axonal bundles at the midline <b>decussations</b> of fiber tracts. In more mature brains, somata of R 2 D 5 -positive radial glial cells that had migrated ventrally were observed within the palisades, and in adult cats, most of the R 2 D 5 -positive radial processes were found to have retracted from the ventral parts of the midsagittal seam. The spatial arrangement of R 2 D 5 -positive processes suggests that they may have persistent functional roles as an interface between ventricular humoral signals and midsagittal groups of neurons in the postnatally developing brainstem and in the adult brainstem. The structure of the midline glial system suggests also that it plays a role in organizing the spatial arrangement of decussating axons during development...|$|R

50|$|A nerve tract, is {{a bundle}} of nerve fibers (axons) {{connecting}} nuclei of the central nervous system. In the peripheral nervous system {{this is known as}} a nerve fascicle. The main nerve tracts in the central nervous system are of three types - association fibers, commissural fibers, and projection fibers.

Examples are the posterior commissure and the corpus callosum.
