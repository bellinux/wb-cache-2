40|$|A bone of {{contention}} always arises in labour relations and ADR {{systems have been}} established so as to rectify labour disputes. Zimbabwe has a dual juncture labour system whereby the labour laws are not harmonized as {{both private and public}} sector are governed by different labour statutes. The Public Service Regulations Act governs the Public service employees excluding the security forces whereas the Labour Act governs private sector employees, metropolitan councils and parastatals. The study addressed how labour disputes are resolved through conciliation and arbitration procedures in Zimbabwe. The underlying principles of conciliation and arbitration practice in the country which involves a number of factors namely accessibility, speed, privacy and costs which provides for parties concerned to seek justice. It can be noted that there are major drawbacks to conciliation and arbitration practice in Zimbabwe due to a number of challenges that are encountered which include the lack of competence amongst conciliators and arbitrators as there are no clear specific guidelines on how conciliation proceedings are conducted with each conciliator conducts proceedings {{in his or her own}} way deemed necessary as there are no training services offered by the Ministry of Labour on how disputes should be rectified. The study found out that the ADR conciliation and arbitration practice in Zimbabwe is ineffective as it lacks enforceable mechanisms for its determinations and awards and as a result disputes take a longer period to be finalized as they spill into local courts for registration and enforcement. The regulatory environment on labour relations is shallow in the sense that it lacks clear indications on the resolution of industrial conflicts in the provision of the time frame labour disputes are to be administered and finalized.

40|$|New Zealand and Australia share {{a common}} {{heritage}} of compulsory arbitration. This article explores {{the way in which}} New Zealand has departed from this tradition. Three phases in the deconstruction of compulsory arbitration and reregulation of industrial relations are identified. The first is associated with the events that led up to the Industrial Relations Act 1973. That statute formally endorsed the growth of free collective bargaining and introduced the North American distinction between <b>disputes</b> <b>of</b> interest and <b>disputes</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights.</b> The second is identified with the fourth Labour government (1984 - 1990), which made arbitration voluntary in a climate of extensive economic liberalization and encouraged a shift from occupational awards to a mixture of industry and enterprise bargaining. The third is presently unfolding as the new National government begins work on its election pledge to shift the basis of union legitimacy from historical registration to employee choice. If completed, the third phase will ensure the substitution of centralization and compulsion with decentralization and voluntarism in the framework of collective labour law in New Zealand.

40|$|The {{meaning of}} the term “benefits” in the context of unfair labour {{practice}} jurisprudence, having previously been unsettled for more than a decade, has now been settled by the Labour Appeal Court in the Apollo. 1 Prior to Apollo, 2 our courts have struggled to adopt a stance to maintain the distinction between <b>disputes</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> and <b>disputes</b> <b>of</b> interest as separate compartments. The prevalent view at that stage was that, in order for an employee to lodge a dispute at the CCMA or Bargaining Council the employee would have to show that he or she had a right to the benefit that arises by virtue of contract, statute or collective agreement, failing which the CCMA or a Bargaining Council would not have the jurisdiction to determine the dispute, in which case it may constitute a <b>dispute</b> <b>of</b> interest and the employee will have to embark on an industrial action to secure a benefit. Apollo 3 endorsed a previous decision of the Labour Court, 4 i. e. by placing “benefits” into the following two categories: (1) Where the dispute is about a demand by employees concerning their benefits, it can be settled by way of industrial action. (2) Where the dispute concerns the fairness of the employer's conduct, it must be settled by way of adjudication or arbitration. As a result of the above categorisation, the CCMA or Bargaining Council may adjudicate a dispute relating to benefits where there is a pre-existing benefit and the employer refuses to comply with its obligation towards the employer in that regard. It may also adjudicate disputes relating to the provision of a car allowance (i. e. where the employer retains the discretion to grant or withhold the allowance) and disputes relating to the provision of bonuses (i. e. where the employer retains the discretion to grant or withhold the bonus). In this treatise, I set out the history and development of the legislation in relation to the concept of “benefits” (in the context of unfair labour practice) so as to understand how our Labour Appeal Court has now come to settle the issues above...|$|R
40|$|The {{uncertainty}} {{surrounding the}} concept benefit as provided for in section 186 (2) of the Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995 was created {{not by the}} courts but rather by the legislature. The concept is not defined and clearly has a wide ambit. In previous decisions the courts upheld a restrictive interpretation of benefits to maintain the divide between <b>disputes</b> <b>of</b> interest and <b>disputes</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> {{and to ensure that}} issues that should be the subject of negotiation could not become issues that can be decided by an arbitrator. Previously the courts insisted that a benefit was something arising out of a contract or law. In the Apollo case the court had to determine what constitutes a benefit and if a benefit is limited to an entitlement which arises ex contractu or ex lege. The court found that the early retirement scheme was a benefit, although the employee at that stage did not have a contractual entitlement to the benefit and that the benefit was subject to the employer's discretion. What becomes clear from this case is that the unfair labour practice jurisdiction cannot be used to assert an entitlement to new benefits, new forms of remuneration or new policies. The Labour Appeal Court criticizes the distinction between salaries and remuneration drawn by our courts and describes it as artificial and unsustainable. Under the unfair labour practice regime the conduct of the employer may be scrutinized by the CCMA in at least two instances, namely when an employer fails to comply with a contractual obligation, an entitlement or right that an employee may have in terms of a statute, and secondly when an employer exercises a discretion under the contractual terms of a scheme conferring a benefit, including situations where the employer enjoys a discretion in terms of benefits provided in terms of a policy or practice – rights created judicially. This decision places the emphasis on the employer's actions and the unfairness of such acts or omissions. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{ideal of}} the rule of law speaks {{differently}} to law-makers and law-appliers. The judge, being the legal official tasked with the application of law by the court, is not in the lawmaker’s position of choosing what, legally, ought to obtain, but rather is tasked with furthering, by administering, what, legally, already obtains. This demarcation of responsibilities rests on the ability of the law-maker to settle authoritatively moral-political questions in such a way as to render possible the artificial techne of legal reasoning. Bills <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> are unusual law-making acts insofar as they deliberately fail to settle moral-political questions under law by declining to specify the general right ‘P has the right to x’. How, then, have judges sought to satisfy their law-applying role in relation to <b>disputed</b> claims <b>of</b> <b>rights?</b> The approach shared by judges in Europe and much of the Commonwealth is to interpret the open-ended <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> bills <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> to include nearly all possible instances of conduct that could be related to the right, with the consequence that nearly all legislation, including legislative specifications <b>of</b> open-ended <b>rights,</b> could be held to infringe the bill <b>of</b> <b>rights.</b> In turn, the legality of legislation turns on judiciallycreated standards of proportionality and balancing, which lack the discipline afforded by technical legal reasoning. As a consequence, judges have assumed the function of law-makers, with all of the associated challenges to the rule of law when law-applying institutions make law in the very moment the legal subject is before them...|$|R
