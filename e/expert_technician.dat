40|$|One of {{the most}} {{critical}} issues in the management of post-earthquake emergency is the prompt identification {{of the most}} damaged urban areas. Rapid detection of damage distribution is crucial for Civil Protection during the management of the first emergency phase, in order to both address assistance teams and identify priorities in planning the usability inspections, thus permitting people to go back, as safe as possible, to their houses. Generally, the estimation of building usability is performed by means of a building-by-building survey based on a form to be filled out by <b>expert</b> <b>technicians</b> (Masi et al. 2016). Different countries adopt different forms whose result in terms of usability is dependent essentially on building damage and, in some cases, vulnerability conditions of buildings. When the affected area is large, usability inspections can require {{a lot of time and}} a huge number of <b>expert</b> <b>technicians.</b> Therefore, great efforts have been made during past earthquakes in order to define rapid procedures to identify areas not severely damaged and then potentially with a low percentage of unusable buildings.

40|$|Lamb {{waves are}} widely used to detect damage in both {{metallic}} and composites structures. The technique is based on ultrasonic wave packets propagating in solids having one dimension {{on the order of}} magnitude of a wavelength. Although Lamb waves have demonstrated great capabilities in detecting even small local defects, they suffer the effect of environmental noise and often require the intervention of an <b>expert</b> <b>technician</b> for the collection and analysis of a large amount of data collected by the sensors. Laser based sensing has the potential to alleviate some of these problems due to its ability to perform automatic acquisition scans over a given array of points selected by the operator. The data analysis can then be carried out through the use of appropriate algorithms. In this paper our preliminary work utilizing a laser vibrometer for Lamb wave sensing is presented. A comparison between experimental data and numerical results obtained from an explicit finite element model is then reported.

VR and AR systems are now widely regarded as promising training platforms for complex and highly demanding IMA tasks. However, {{there is a need to}} empirically evaluate their efficiency and effectiveness compared to traditional training methods. Forty <b>expert</b> <b>technicians</b> were randomly assigned to four training groups in an electronic actuator assembly task: VR (training with the VR platform twice), Control-VR (watching a filmed demonstration twice), AR (training with the AR platform once), and Control-AR (training with the real actuator and the aid of a filmed demonstration once). A post-training test evaluated performance in the real task. Results demonstrate that, in general, the VR and AR training groups required longer training time compared to the Control-VR and Control-AR groups, respectively. There were fewer unsolved errors in the AR group compared to the Control-AR group, and no significant differences in final performance between the VR and Control-VR groups, probably due to a ceiling effect created by the use of two training trials in the selected task for participants who were <b>expert</b> <b>technicians.</b> The results suggest that use of the AR platform for training IMA tasks should be encouraged and use of the VR platform for that purpose should be further evaluated.

40|$|Three {{automatic}} blood-gas analysers {{were compared}} {{for ease of}} use; calibration; reproducibility and accuracy of results; maintenance; fault-finding; and use of <b>expert</b> <b>technician</b> time. Results obtained from arterial and capillary blood were compared with duplicate values obtained with a semi-automatic analyser controlled and calibrated with tonometered blood. No analyser was fully automatic, and all three needed maintenance by expert technicians. Difficulties were encountered when inexperienced operators used the machines. One automatic blood-gas analyser gave aberrant values for oxygen pressure (PO 2) due to electrode dysfunction that was not indicated by the fault-finding system. A second analyser gave significantly lower values for blood pH than the standard machine. A comparison of pH, carbon dioxide pressure (PCO 2), and PO 2 measured in 40 simultaneous paired samples of arterial and arterialised capillary blood showed no significant difference for pH or PCO 2, but the PO 2 values were significantly lower in the capillary samples over the range studied. We conclude that all machines perform satisfactorily in terms of blood-gas analysis, but none may be regarded as fully automatic. Some degree of technical supervision is essential, as is proper training for all potential users...|$|E

There are many developments for detecting a single induction motor fault using several methodologies and techniques. Different methodologies have been developed for multiple fault detection having the disadvantage of giving a qualitative result requiring an <b>expert</b> <b>technician</b> for estimating the motor condition, with the possibility of inducing observation errors. This work proposes a quantitative {{general methodology}} for online induction motor monitoring and identification of multiple faults in an automatic way, and its hardware processing unit for real time applications, based on the startup vibration transient analysis. The proposed methodology is tested on three different cases of study: a motor with broken rotor bars, an unbalanced motor shaft, and a motor with misaligned load. The results show that the proposed methodology is highly reliable for detecting different faults in induction motors with a certainty of 99. 7 %. The developed approach can be extended for detecting other faults by a proper calibration, thanks to its generalized nature...|$|E
40|$|Malaria is a {{worldwide}} health problem, where {{almost half of}} the worldâs population is at risk of infection, and in 2015 it caused 500. 000 deaths. This disease is has a global distribution, but mainly found in developing areas. One of the Sustainable Development Goals established by the WHOc for 2030 is to eradicate this disease. Thus, prevention and transmission control are the keys to getting it. This may be possible if there is a thorough and rapid diagnosis to establish the most appropriate treatment. Despite the new diagnosis tools developed in recent years, optical microscopy remains the tool for excellence in the diagnosis of malaria. It has a high sensitivity and specificity if it is performed by a skilled and trained microscopist. Nevertheless, in endemic areas of the disease, most technicians of health centers are not familiarized with malaria parasites or do not have a high experience. Therefore, an automatic diagnostic system, which is based on microscopy but does not require the presence of an <b>expert</b> <b>technician,</b> is a good solution for these areas and it can help to control the disease and its transmission. This automatic diagnosis is based on the development of a mobile application. For this, it needs an extensive database of images to train the application software and thus reduce false positives and negatives that may occur due to other forms similar to parasites. The images have been obtained from blood samples stained with Giemsa. In total 62 samples of the four species causing human malaria were examined to get the corresponding image. 1714 images were obtained between positive (1328) and negative (386). Most of the images obtained correspond to the specie Plasmodium falciparum because of its relevance in the disease. The first results of the application are encouraging because it is able to detect 80 % of the parasites examined. In conclusion, an automatic diagnosis allows rapid and careful diagnosis, and also lower cost than current and rapid detection techniques: a drop of 5 to 9 â¬ versus 30 â¬ for the rapid screening tes...|$|E
