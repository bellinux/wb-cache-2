5|$|Bob {{finds the}} action and higher pay rejuvenating; he begins {{rigorous}} training while awaiting more work from Mirage {{for the next two}} months. Discovering a tear in his suit, he visits superhero costume designer Edna Mode. Mode, assuming that Helen knows what Bob is doing, makes new suits for the entire family. However, she rejects Bob's request for a cape, citing the large number of Supers who perished when their capes got caught <b>in</b> <b>something.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lisa {{complains}} to Marge that Homer {{never gets}} involved with her interests. Marge suggests that Lisa {{take an interest}} <b>in</b> <b>something</b> her father does, so she decides to join Homer on the couch while he is watching football on television. After being ripped off by a premium rate betting advice hotline, a desperate Homer turns to Lisa to pick a winner. She picks the Miami Dolphins, prompting Homer to call Moe's Tavern to place his $50 bet. In the end, the Dolphins win, and Homer and Lisa celebrate. Meanwhile, Marge takes Bart shopping for new clothes that the bullies taunt him for.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{has played}} an enormous role in refining the wings, control and sensory systems, {{and anything else}} that affects aerodynamics or kinematics. One noteworthy trait is wing twist. Most insect wings are twisted, as are helicopter blades, with a higher angle of attack at the base. The twist generally is between 10 and 20 degrees. In addition to this twist, the wing surfaces are not necessarily flat or featureless; most larger insects have wing membranes distorted and angled between the veins {{in such a way that}} the cross-section of the wings approximates an airfoil. Thus, the wing's basic shape already is capable of generating a small amount of lift at zero angle of attack. Most insects control their wings by adjusting tilt, stiffness, and flapping frequency of the wings with tiny muscles in the thorax (below). Some insects evolved other wing features that are not advantageous for flight, but play a role <b>in</b> <b>something</b> else, such as mating or protection.|$|E

5|$|Some misguided Hollywood {{press agent}} sought to alter Como's life story by {{changing}} his previous occupation from barber to coal miner, claiming {{it would make}} for better press. Fred Othman, a Hollywood columnist, publicly stated that he believed Como the barber was just a publicity gimmick. Perry gave him a shave and haircut at the Fox Studios barber shop to prove him wrong. In 1985, Como related {{the story of his}} first film role experience <b>in</b> <b>Something</b> for the Boys. He sat ready to work in his dressing room for two weeks without being called. Perry spent the next two weeks playing golf, still not missed by the studio. It was five weeks before he was actually called to the set, despite the studio's initial urgent report for work notice. When Como finally appeared, the director had no idea who he was.|$|E

25|$|Phaedrus {{believes}} {{that one of}} the greatest goods given is the relationship between lover and boy. This relationship brings guidance and love into the boy’s life. Because the boy has a lover as such a valuable role model, he is on his best behavior to not get caught <b>in</b> <b>something</b> shameful. To get caught <b>in</b> <b>something</b> shameful would be like letting down his lover, therefore the boy is consistently acting his best. The absence of shame makes room for a sense of pride to come in; pride from the wealthy feeling of impressing one's own lover. Impressing one's own lover brings more learning and guidance into the boy's life.|$|E
6000|$|... "Every psychical {{phenomenon}} {{is characterized by}} what the scholastics of the Middle Ages called the intentional (also the mental) inexistence of an object, and what we, although with not quite unambiguous expressions, would call relation to a content, direction towards an object (which is not here {{to be understood as}} a reality), or immanent objectivity. Each contains <b>something</b> <b>in</b> itself as an object, though not each in the same way. <b>In</b> presentation <b>something</b> is presented, <b>in</b> judgment <b>something</b> is acknowledged or rejected, <b>in</b> love <b>something</b> is loved, <b>in</b> hatred hated, in desire desired, and so on.|$|R

25|$|Traditionally Judaism credits Ezra with {{establishing}} the Great Assembly of scholars and prophets, {{the forerunner of}} the Sanhedrin, as the authority on matters of religious law. The Great Assembly is credited with establishing numerous features of contemporary traditional Judaism <b>in</b> <b>something</b> like their present form, including Torah reading, the Amidah, and celebration of the feast of Purim.|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah in Pirkei Avot deduced {{that the}} {{controversy}} of Korah {{and his followers}} was not {{for the sake of}} Heaven, and thus was destined not to result in permanent change. The Mishnah contrasted Korah's argument to those between Hillel and Shammai, which the Mishnah taught were controversies for the sake of Heaven, destined to result <b>in</b> <b>something</b> permanent.|$|E

25|$|If a {{rotation}} around a point or axis {{is followed by}} a second rotation around the same point/axis, a third rotation results. The reverse (inverse) of {{a rotation}} is also a rotation. Thus, the rotations around a point/axis form a group. However, a rotation around a point or axis and a rotation around a different point/axis may result <b>in</b> <b>something</b> other than a rotation, e.g. a translation.|$|E
25|$|Newton's method {{requires}} that the derivative be calculated directly. An analytical expression for the derivative may not be easily obtainable and could be expensive to evaluate. In these situations, it may be appropriate to approximate the derivative by using the slope of a line through two nearby points on the function. Using this approximation would result <b>in</b> <b>something</b> like the secant method whose convergence is slower than that of Newton's method.|$|E

25|$|Passion {{is closely}} aligned with faith in Kierkegaard's thought. Faith as a passion is what drives humans to seek reality and truth in a transcendent world, even though {{everything}} we can know intellectually speaks against it. To live and die for a belief, to stake everything one has {{and is in the}} belief <b>in</b> <b>something</b> that has a higher meaning than anything in the world—this is belief and passion at their highest.|$|E
25|$|In another short, Little Beau Pepé, Pepé, {{attempting}} {{to find the}} most arousing cologne with which to impress Penelope, sprays a combination of perfumes and colognes upon himself. This resulted <b>in</b> <b>something</b> close to a love-potion, leading Penelope to fall madly in love with Pepé in an explosion of hearts. Pepé is revealed to be extremely frightened of overly-affectionate women ("But Madame!"), much to his dismay, as Penelope quickly captures him and smothers him in more love than even he could imagine.|$|E
25|$|Pratt kicked 15 goals 3 behinds (eight of {{his goals}} were kicked <b>in</b> <b>something</b> like ten minutes) in round three against Essendon, a VFL record that would stand until 1949.
