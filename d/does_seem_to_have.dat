25|$|In {{light of}} this and other events, {{historian}} B. A. Saletare has described Tipu Sultan as a defender of the Hindu dharma, who also patronised other temples including one at Melkote, for which he issued a Kannada decree that the Shrivaishnava invocatory verses there should be recited in the traditional form. The temple at Melkote still has gold and silver vessels with inscriptions indicating that they were presented by the Sultan. Tipu Sultan also presented four silver cups to the Lakshmikanta Temple at Kalale. Tipu Sultan <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> repossessed unauthorised grants of land made to Brahmins and temples, but those which had proper sanads (certificates) were not. It was a normal practice for any ruler, Muslim or Hindu, on his accession or on the conquest of new territory.|$|E

500|$|The {{main source}} for the Great Greco-Persian Wars is the Greek {{historian}} Herodotus. Herodotus, who {{has been called the}} 'Father of History', was born in 484 BC in Halicarnassus, Asia Minor (then under Persian overlordship). He wrote his 'Enquiries' (GreekHistoria; English(The) Histories) around 440430 BC, trying to trace the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars, which would still have been relatively recent history (the wars finally ending in 450 BC). Herodotus's approach was entirely novel, and at least in Western society, he <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> invented 'history' as we know it. As Holland has it: [...] "For the first time, a chronicler set himself to trace the origins of a conflict not to a past so remote so as to be utterly fabulous, nor to the whims and wishes of some god, nor to a people's claim to manifest destiny, but rather explanations he could verify personally." ...|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} for {{the plot of}} Outlaw Star has been mixed. Churosh found that though the series features many clichés of 1990's science fiction anime, Outlaw Star manages to transcend them as well. [...] "Maybe it doesn't go anywhere that other series haven't already been", the reviewer stated. [...] "But boy, {{does it have a}} damn good time getting there." [...] Upatkoon observed that the plot [...] " [...] off with a bang at the beginning" [...] and then begins to drag. Keith Dawe of Animerica also noted this about the anime's pacing, stating that even as the first few episodes do well to begin the narrative, the show's writers rely too heavily on inertia to advance it. He went on to remark that the series suffers from [...] "unfocused scripting" [...] and that [...] "one has to endure the occasional cheesy episode to reap the rewards of a show that is clever, pragmatic and amusing". However, Dawe did regard the English script writing and voice acting, and called the over-the-top introductory narration for each episode a reminder that the show should be enjoyed for what it was. Owens commented that the plot will not seem very original, but that it <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> direction, despite said direction not being very clear.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{he is now}} on {{a closer}} social {{standing}} to Blackadder than before, he still receives the same (and possibly more) level of abuse as his Elizabethan ancestor. Blackadder punches him; kicks him; breaks a milk-jug over his head; smashes a huge turnip on his head; roasts {{him for a few}} minutes on a spit; grabs him by the shirt collar; threatens to cut him up into strips and tell the prince that he [...] "walked over a very sharp cattle grid in an extremely heavy hat"; and promises five minutes of hellish tortures involving a small pencil, surpassing anything possible from Beelzebub over all eternity. However, he <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a higher level of friendship with Blackadder than the other series.|$|E

2500|$|... "It {{is fairly}} clear that most Anglo-Saxon cemeteries are unrepresentative {{of the whole}} population, and {{particularly}} the whole age range. This was, therefore, a community which made decisions about the {{disposal of the dead}} based upon various factors, but at those we can barely guess. Was the inclusion of some but not all individuals subject to political control, or cultural screening? Was this a mark of ethnicity or did it represent a particular kinship, real or constructed, or the adherents of a particular cult? Was it status specific, with the rural proletariat – who would have been {{the vast majority of the}} population – perhaps excluded? So are many of these cemeteries associated with specific, high-status households and weighted particularly towards adult members? We do not know, but the commitment of particular parts of the community to an imported and in some senses 'Germanic', cremation ritual <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been considerable, and is something which requires explanation." ...|$|E
2500|$|He was {{the subject}} of a {{controversial}} incident in Peshawar during the MCC tour of 1955–56. One evening some of the English players, fed up with what they regarded as Baig's pomposity on the field and his bias in favour of Pakistan, kidnapped him, took him back to their hotel and tipped a bucket of water over him. The incident caused outrage in Pakistan and almost led to the abandonment of the tour, but diplomacy by the MCC president, Lord Alexander, and Iskander Mirza, the president of the Board of Control for Cricket in Pakistan, smoothed things over sufficiently to allow the tour to continue. Peter Oborne, who has researched the incident, doubts if the suggestions of bias were valid. He points out, for example, that Henry Cooper, who managed the New Zealand cricket team that toured Pakistan in 1955, had singled out Baig as the best of the Pakistan umpires, calling him [...] "first rate". Baig <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been more than usually vain, however; he told the MCC team's manager that people came to his matches to watch him umpire.|$|E
