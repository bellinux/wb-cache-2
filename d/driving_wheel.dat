5|$|The net {{aerodynamic}} drag forces {{may be considered}} to act at a single point, called the center of pressure. At high speeds, this will create a net moment about the rear <b>driving</b> <b>wheel</b> and result in a net transfer of load from the front wheel to the rear wheel. Also, depending on {{the shape of the}} bike and the shape of any fairing that might be installed, aerodynamic lift may be present that either increases or further reduces the load on the front wheel.|$|E
5|$|The {{first batch}} of twenty {{locomotives}} was ordered in April 1941, although {{the changes in}} design to the Light Pacific arrangement meant that production was delayed until late 1944. Due to wartime contract work at Brighton works, the boilers were built under contract at the North British Locomotive Company. Before {{the first of the}} class had been delivered, the order was increased to thirty, with a second batch of ten ordered in September 1944. Deliveries from Brighton works began in May 1945 with prototype No. 21C101 Exeter, and proceeded at the rate of about two locomotives per month. The class was gradually run in on the Central Section until October 1945, when they were successfully trialled on Plymouth and Kentish services. By the time the first fifteen had entered traffic a further order of fifteen was placed, with these entering service between June and October 1946. From this batch onwards, traction was improved by the addition of steam sanding to the front <b>driving</b> <b>wheel,</b> with covers added to protect the motion from sand falling from the filler pipes.|$|E
25|$|Vehicles with {{a single}} <b>driving</b> <b>wheel.</b> Besides motorcycles, which are {{generally}} not classified as automobiles, this group includes most three-wheeled cars. These were quite common in Europe in the mid-20th Century, but have now become rare there. They are still common {{in some areas of}} the developing world, such as India. Some early four-wheeled cars also had only one <b>driving</b> <b>wheel</b> to avoid the need for a differential. However, this arrangement led to many problems. The system was unbalanced, the <b>driving</b> <b>wheel</b> would easily spin, etc. Because of these problems, few such vehicles were made.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> on {{locomotives}} varied quite a bit. Some early locomotives had {{as few as}} two <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> (one axle). The largest number of total <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> was 24 (twelve axles) on the 2-8-8-8-2 and 2-8-8-8-4 locomotives. The largest number of coupled <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> was 14 (seven axles) on the ill-fated AA20 4-14-4 locomotive.|$|R

25|$|The Butler Petrol Cycle was a {{three-wheeled}} vehicle, {{with the}} rear wheel directly driven by a 5/8hp (466W) 600 cc (40 in3; 2¼×5-inch {57×127-mm}) flat twin four stroke engine (with magneto ignition replaced by coil and battery) equipped with rotary valves and a float-fed carburettor (five years before Maybach) and Ackermann steering, {{all of which were}} state of the art at the time. Starting was by compressed air. The engine was liquid-cooled, with a radiator over the rear <b>driving</b> <b>wheel.</b> Speed was controlled by means of a throttle valve lever. No braking system was fitted; the vehicle was stopped by raising and lowering the rear <b>driving</b> <b>wheel</b> using a foot-operated lever; the weight of the machine was then borne by two small castor wheels. The driver was seated between the front wheels. It wasn't, however, a success, as Butler failed to find sufficient financial backing.|$|E
25|$|On 25 September 1933, S301 broke {{a driving}} axle while hauling the 16:00 express to Albury, causing the left centre <b>driving</b> <b>wheel</b> to {{separate}} from the locomotive. There were no casualties, although the locomotive suffered significant damage. An investigation into the accident found that the axles were overstressed and the VR Commissioners announced that all four Sclass locomotives would be equipped with axles of a revised design.|$|E
50|$|The motor {{framework}} {{with the}} wheelset bearing is located between the wheel disks of the <b>driving</b> <b>wheels.</b> The gear wheel, which {{is housed in}} an auxiliary frame outside the <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> and {{is surrounded by a}} protective casing, is {{on one side of the}} <b>driving</b> <b>wheels.</b> Each gear wheel is driven by an individual traction motor, which is located above the gear wheel in the locomotive body.|$|R

25|$|Vehicles with {{separate}} motors for the driving wheels. Electric cars {{can have a}} separate motor for each <b>driving</b> <b>wheel,</b> {{eliminating the need for}} a differential, but usually with some form of gearing at each motor to get the large wheel torques necessary. A multi-motor electric vehicle such as the Dual Motor Tesla Model S can electronically control the power distribution between the motors on a millisecond scale, in this case acting as a centre differential where open differentials are still employed left-to-right.|$|E
25|$|Larger {{machines}} printing {{from two}} to sixteen colours are precisely similar in principle to the above, but differ somewhat in detail and are naturally more complex and difficult to operate. In a twelve-colour machine, for example, twelve copper rollers, each carrying one portion of the design, are arranged round a central pressure cylinder, or bowl, common to all, and each roller is driven by a common <b>driving</b> <b>wheel,</b> called the crown wheel, actuated, in most cases, by its own steam-engine or motor. Another {{difference is that the}} adjustment of pressure is transferred from the cylinder to the rollers which works in specially constructed bearings capable of the following movements: (1) Of being screwed up bodily until the rollers are lightly pressed against the central bowl; (2) of being moved to and fro sideways so that the rollers may he laterally adjusted; and (3) of being moved up or down for the purpose of adjusting the rollers in vertical direction. Notwithstanding the great latitude of movement thus provided each roller is furnished with a box-wheel, which serves the double purpose of connecting or gearing it to the <b>driving</b> <b>wheel,</b> and of affording a fine adjustment. Each roller is further furnished with its own colour-box and doctors.|$|E
25|$|Locomotives {{have their}} own braking system, {{independent}} {{from the rest of}} the train. Locomotive brakes employ large shoes which press against the <b>driving</b> <b>wheel</b> treads. With the advent of air brakes, a separate system also allowed the driver to control the brakes on all cars. These systems require steam-powered compressors, which are mounted on the side of the boiler or on the smokebox front. Almost all of these compressors were of the Westinghouse single-stage or cross-compound variety. Such systems operated in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.|$|E
50|$|Between 1869 and 1873, new {{locomotives}} {{were built}} to replace {{four of the}} original 9 ft diameter <b>driving</b> <b>wheeled</b> engines, re-using the engine numbers of the locomotives being replaced. These four replacement engines had slightly smaller 8 ft diameter <b>driving</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R

40|$|Autonomous Mobile Locomotion is {{of extreme}} {{importance}} in RoboCup robots. Even though in 2050 the robotic team will very likely use legs rather than wheels, {{at the moment}} all teams on middle size league use wheels to overcome other problems first. Most teams are using two <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> (with one or two cast <b>wheels),</b> four <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> and even three <b>driving</b> <b>wheels.</b> The Minho team has been using two <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> for the last 5 years (with two caster wheels), but for reaction speed optimization purposes a new approach of three wheels is being developed. This paper deals with the description of such platform, it describes the advantages and also the type of control used...|$|R
25|$|Vehicles {{using two}} freewheels. A freewheel, as {{used on a}} pedal bicycle for example, allows a road wheel to rotate faster than the {{mechanism}} that drives it, allowing a cyclist to stop pedalling while going downhill. Some early automobiles had the engine driving two freewheels, one for each driving road wheel. When the vehicle turned, the engine would continue to drive the wheel {{on the inside of}} the curve, but the wheel on the outside was permitted to rotate faster by its freewheel. Thus, while turning, the vehicle had only one <b>driving</b> <b>wheel.</b> Driving in reverse is impossible as is engine braking due to the freewheels.|$|E
25|$|Steam {{locomotives}} are locomotives with a {{steam engine}} that provides adhesion. Coal, petroleum, or wood is burned in a firebox, boiling {{water in the}} boiler to create pressurized steam. The steam travels through the smokebox before leaving via the chimney or smoke stack. In the process, it powers a piston that transmits power directly through a connecting rod (US: main rod) and a crankpin (US: wristpin) on the <b>driving</b> <b>wheel</b> (US main driver) or to a crank on a driving axle. Steam locomotives have been phased out {{in most parts of}} the world for economical and safety reasons, although many are preserved in working order by heritage railways.|$|E
25|$|In its {{simplest}} {{form the}} roller-printing machine {{consists of a}} strong cast iron cylinder mounted in adjustable bearings capable of sliding up and down slots in {{the sides of the}} rigid iron framework. Beneath this cylinder the engraved copper roller rests in stationary bearings and is supplied with colour from a wooden roller that revolves in a colour-box below it. The copper roller is mounted on a stout steel axle, at one end of which a cogwheel is fixed to gear with the <b>driving</b> <b>wheel</b> of the machine, and at the other end a smaller cogwheel to drive the colour-furnishing roller. The cast iron pressure cylinder is wrapped with several thicknesses of a special material made of wool and cotton lapping, the object of which is to provide the elasticity necessary to enable it to properly force the cloth to be printed into the lines of engraving.|$|E
50|$|Under the Whyte {{notation}} for {{the classification}} of steam locomotives, 2-2-4-0T represents the wheel arrangement of two leading wheels on one axle, two <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> powered from the inside cylinders, four coupled <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> powered from the outside cylinders but no trailing wheels.|$|R
40|$|Traditional two wheels {{differential}} drive normally used on mobile robots have manoeuvrability limitations and {{take time to}} sort out.

50|$|A {{coupling}} rod or side rod connects the <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> of a locomotive. Steam locomotives in particular usually have them, but some diesel and electric locomotives, especially older ones and shunters, also have them. The {{coupling rod}}s transfer {{the power to}} all <b>driving</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
25|$|The torque {{applied to}} each <b>driving</b> <b>wheel</b> {{is the result}} of the engine, transmission, and drive axle {{applying}} a twisting force against the resistance of the traction at that roadwheel. In lower gears, and thus at lower speeds, and unless the load is exceptionally high, the drivetrain can supply as much torque as necessary, so the limiting factor becomes the traction under each wheel. It is therefore convenient to define traction as the amount of force that can be transmitted between the tire and the road surface before the wheel starts to slip. If the torque applied to one of the drive wheels exceeds the threshold of traction, then that wheel will spin, and thus provide torque only at the other driven wheel equal to the sliding friction at the slipping wheel. The reduced net traction may still be enough to propel the vehicle slowly.|$|E
500|$|A tank {{suspension}} (for each side) {{consisted of}} two bogies, four rubber-covered return rollers, a track <b>driving</b> <b>wheel</b> and a track idler. Each bogie consisted of a cast box, four twin rubber-covered road wheels connected by balancing levers and two one-quarter elliptic leaf springs. The cast track <b>driving</b> <b>wheel</b> with removable sprocket ring was located in front, and the track idler with a crank lever tightener was located in the rear part of the vehicle. A track made from chrome-nickel steel was [...] wide and consisted of 108–109 links.|$|E

50|$|These {{types of}} engines, that Casey pilots, are very {{different}} and have different wheel arrangements, such as the 4-6-0s having ten wheels (four leading, six <b>driving</b> <b>wheels,</b> and no trailing wheels), and the 4-4-0s having eight wheels (four leading, four <b>driving</b> <b>wheels,</b> and no trailing wheels).|$|R
