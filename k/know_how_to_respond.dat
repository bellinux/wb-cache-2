By 17 May, {{as students}} from across the country poured into the capital to join the movement, protests of varying sizes were occurring in some 400 Chinese cities. Students demonstrated at provincial party headquarters in Fujian, Hubei, and Xinjiang. Without a clearly articulated official position from the Beijing leadership, local authorities did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond.</b> Since the demonstrations now incorporated a wide array of social groups, each carrying its own set of grievances, it became increasingly unclear with whom the government should negotiate, and what exactly the demands were. The government, continuing to be split {{on how to deal with}} the movement, saw its authority and legitimacy gradually erode as the hunger strikers took the limelight and gained widespread sympathy.

The Morning Telegraph understood the historical fiction being presented and praised the production though they also highlighted technical issues in the splitting of the troops on the landing and the poor pulling of a prop cannon. The Billboard praised the film's acting and photography, but did not specifically refer to whether the film was fictional when it stated, [...] "An incident from history at the period of the Revolution is the makeup of this picture." [...] Some of the highest praise was given by the reviewer of The Moving Picture World which stated, [...] "The story is so well told that the audience is held almost spellbound in places as the reel moves through the changing scenes.

The Nasserites sought to reestablish the United Arab Republic, the former federation encompassing Egypt and Syria from 1958 to 1961, on Gamal Abdel Nasser's terms, the Ba'athists were skeptical of a new union with Nasser, and wanted a loose federation where the Ba'ath Party could rule Syria alone without interference.

He perceived a charm, that would be recognized anywhere, in her manner, though it was not of his world; her fresh pleasure in all she saw, though he did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to it, was very winning; he respected what he thought the good sense running through her transports; he wondered at the culture she had somewhere, somehow got; and he was so good as to find that her literary enthusiasms had nothing offensive, but were as pretty and naive as a girl's love of flowers. Moreover, he approved of some personal attributes of hers: a low, gentle voice, tender long-lashed eyes; a trick of drooping shoulders, and of idle hands fallen into the lap, one in the other's palm; a serene repose of face; a light and eager laugh. There was nothing so novel in those traits, and in different combination he had seen them a thousand times; yet in her they strangely wrought upon his fancy. She had that soft, kittenish way with her which invites a caressing patronage, but, as he learned, she had also the kittenish equipment for resenting over-condescension; and she never took him half so much as when she showed the high spirit that was in her, and defied him most.|$|E

Furthermore, the Creature is depicted as a rational being rather than a senseless force of destruction.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} system that motivates adaptive, curious {{behavior}} in a robot in a survival scenario.

Neural nets are efficient for producing survival behavior, but the robot only <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> stimuli it has seen before- it cannot handle situations it has not trained for. In this study, we couple Intelligent Adaptive Curiosity [1] with a NEAT-evolved [2] survival brain to encourage exploration and learning new situations. We find that this “dual-brain ” approach encourages intelligent exploration and learning in the robot, which benefits survival, and that the survival brain gives the curious brain time to do this learning. Our system shows a statistically significant increase in survival time as compared to two baseline systems, a pure survival brain and a survival brain augmented by random movements. ...|$|R
