5|$|The AFL became {{involved}} in politics when seventeen soldiers launched a coup on April 12, 1980. The group {{was made up of}} Master Sergeant Samuel Doe, two staff sergeants, four sergeants, eight corporals, and two privates. They found President Tolbert sleeping in his office in the Executive Mansion and there they killed him. While then-Sergeant Thomas Quiwonkpa led the plotters, it was the group led by Samuel Doe that found Tolbert <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>office,</b> <b>and</b> it was Doe, as a master sergeant the highest ranking of the group, who went on the radio the next day to announce the overthrow of the long-entrenched True Whig Party government.|$|E
5|$|After he {{completed}} his law degree in 1930 at Fordham Law, {{he worked as}} an assistant engineer for the New York City Subway. After earning his law degree he needed to obtain a clerkship, but {{it was during the}} depression and no one could afford to hire him. He allowed a struggling lawyer to use space <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>and</b> paid for his own clerkship. After working for the Subway, he worked for Thomas F. Riley, who owned the Riley Drilling Company, and they formed the partnership of Riley and O'Malley. With the help of Edwin O'Malley's political connections, Walter's company received contracts from the New York Telephone Company and the New York City Board of Education to perform geological surveys. Subsequently, Walter started the Walter F. O'Malley Engineering Company and published the Subcontractors Register with his uncle, Joseph O'Malley (1893–1985).|$|E

50|$|In {{the midst}} of this crisis, King John died, {{prompting}} many of the barons to desert Louis in favor of John's nine-year-old son, Henry III. In 1217 Prince Louis retook Castle Hedingham and restored it to Oxford, but despite this Oxford transferred his allegiance to the new King in October 1217. Although he did homage to Henry, he was not fully restored <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>offices</b> <b>and</b> lands until February 1218.|$|R
5|$|In his 1931 autobiography, {{the public}} {{relations}} pioneer Harry Reichenbach {{claimed responsibility for the}} controversy surrounding September Morn– and the work's resulting popularity. He stated that Braun and Company had acquired some 2,000 reproductions of the painting which they could not sell, and then hired him for $45 so that he could unload the stock. They then paid for a large lithograph reproduction to be made and put on display. Reichenbach, he stated, then contacted public figures to protest against the display. When there was no response, he accosted Comstock <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>and</b> dragged him to the dealership, where some young children, whom Reichenbach had hired for fifty cents each, lusted over the display. The public relations man then worked towards maintaining interest in the work, prints of which had already increased in price– from 10 cents to a dollar.|$|E
5|$|Little {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} and most successful practitioners of market manipulation, making his fortune by leveraging both short sales and short sellers. In the former, he would sell stocks to other traders under contract to purchase it at a later date, betting that the market value would go down in the future and he could pocket the difference (trade rules have changed, and short selling is more complicated than this today). In the latter he would execute the opposite maneuver, corner a market by buying up all of the bonds of a particular company or sector, up-ticking the price so as to make a profit at the expense of any short sales based on those stocks. Hardworking, highly ambitious, and with his eyes set on the very top from the very beginning, Little commonly spent twelve hours a day working on such maneuvers <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>and</b> a further six during the evening engaged in currency speculation.|$|E
5|$|To {{sequester}} Clayton {{from the}} {{affairs in the}} state, the Brindles and the Democrats decided {{the only thing they}} could do was elect him to the US Senate. However, even though he won unanimously, he refused to take his seat, which would mean letting Johnson become governor. In 1871, the state House of Representatives drafted articles of impeachment against Clayton, charging him {{with a wide variety of}} impeachable actions, including depriving Johnson and several other state officials of offices to which they had been fairly elected, removing state officials and judges from offices to which they had been fairly elected, aiding in fraudulent elections, taking bribes for state railroad bonds, and various other high crimes and misdemeanors. The members of the House then tried to suspend Clayton from his duties as governor by force. They even apparently tried locking him <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>and</b> nailing the door shut. However, Clayton responded that they had no right by the state constitution to deprive him of his office. At the same time, the House also brought impeachment charges against Chief Justice John McClure for his part in trying to deny Johnson the privileges of his office of lieutenant governor.|$|E

Charles then confirmed Robert <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>offices</b> <b>and</b> possessions, after which he continued to defend northern Francia from the attacks of Vikings. Robert defeated a large band of Vikings in the Loire Valley in 921, after which the defeated invaders converted to Christianity and settled near Nantes.|$|R

5|$|When Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman) demands £4000 {{for some}} goods he asked Anthony and Tyler to sell, Anthony says he only has £3000 as {{he needed to}} pay some bills. He agrees to sell a {{necklace}} {{to get some of}} the money, but instead, he gives it to Amira. He then gambles the rest but loses it. Derek then asks Anthony and Tyler to either pay up or steal cable from the railway, otherwise he will break their legs. Anthony goes to Michael for financial help but Michael locks Anthony <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>and</b> calls the police, who arrest Derek and Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker), who offered to help the brothers. They are released without charge, but Derek then accuses Anthony and Tyler of calling the police, and increases their debt to £8000. They realise Michael called the police and confront him, and his partner Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks) discovers what is going on. She pays off the debt, but Michael takes a beating from Derek.|$|E

25|$|In March 1974, Harold Wilson invited Heffer to be Minister of State at the Department of Industry under Tony Benn. Heffer {{accepted}} the offer, while remaining {{concerned that he}} would be cocooned <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>and</b> lose his links with the wider Labour movement outside. He had some difficulties coping with the concept of 'collective responsibility' - denouncing the government's decision to continue a contract to build warships with the right-wing government of Chile on 10 April. Wilson, reluctant to cause trouble with the left-wing, decided not to sack him on the grounds that he was inexperienced. Heffer received many minutes from Wilson asking him to follow government policy in speeches, such that he minuted Wilson to tell him not to send them.|$|E

25|$|The affair {{began with}} the arrest of five men for {{breaking}} and entering into the DNC headquarters at the Watergate complex on Saturday, June 17, 1972. The FBI investigated and discovered a connection between cash found on the burglars and a slush fund used by the Committee for the Re-Election of the President (CRP), the official organization of Nixon's campaign. In July 1973, evidence mounted against the president’s staff, including testimony provided by former staff members in an investigation conducted by the Senate Watergate Committee. The investigation revealed that Nixon had a tape-recording system <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>offices</b> <b>and</b> that he had recorded many conversations.|$|R

25|$|Packer {{was often}} the centre of controversy. One of the {{earliest}} incidents occurred on 7 June 1960, {{when his father was}} trying to take over the Anglican Press, a small publisher run by Francis James. According to author Richard Neville, Frank Packer was angered by James' refusal to sell the Anglican Press, so he sent Kerry and some burly friends to pressure him into selling. They forced their way in and reportedly began vandalising the premises, but James was able to barricade himself <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>and</b> call his friend Rupert Murdoch, Packer's most powerful rival. Murdoch quickly dispatched his own team of 'heavies', who threw Kerry and friends out. Not surprisingly, the Murdoch press had a field day with the news that the son of Australia's biggest media tycoon had been caught brawling in the street.|$|E
25|$|During the {{transfer}} window, the club acquired Les Ferdinand and Rufus Brevett, {{and more importantly}} got Di Canio and Kanouté both back on the pitch and off the treatment table. The club's form improved {{and they began to}} claw their way up the table towards safety. In April, Roeder collapsed <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>and</b> was diagnosed with a brain tumour. He was immediately given a leave of absence and 1980 FA Cup final hero Trevor Brooking took over for the final three games of the Premiership season. However, despite an upturn in the team's form (winning two and drawing one), they were unable to overhaul Bolton and finished 18th in the final table, two points short of the relegation safety zone. West Ham drew early in the season and then lost against Bolton during the run in; a draw against Bolton in their second match would have been sufficient to see West Ham survive. Their ten-year spell in the Premiership was over.|$|E

5000|$|In 2006, McClatchy speculated {{openly about}} resigning, {{possibly}} even selling the team, if the Pirates did not improve. He affirmed {{that he was}} frustrated with his own team, referencing popular and political complaints about the [...] "promise" [...] he made that the publicly funded PNC Park would provide the owners will all the resources they needed to field a winning team. On October 4, 2006, however, McClatchy announced that despite another losing season, he would remain <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>offices,</b> <b>and</b> made only a few minor personnel changes. On January 12, 2007, the Pirates announced that Robert Nutting would replace McClatchy as the Pirates principal owner.

After paying for her items, she sees a moto-sticker on a notice board which reads, [...] "All women are created equal, then some become Marines". The increasingly emotional Perry gathers her possessions from her car trunk, enters a nearby restroom, and begins her change of identity. She cuts her hair short (at this point bursting into tears), removes her bracelets, flattens her breasts, and changes into a hoodie and jeans.|$|E
500|$|Hay and Nicolay divided their responsibilities: Nicolay {{tending to}} assist Lincoln <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>and</b> in meetings, while Hay {{dealt with the}} correspondence, which was very large. Both men tried to shield Lincoln from office-seekers and others who wanted {{to meet with the}} President. Unlike the dour Nicolay, Hay, with his charm, escaped much of the hard {{feelings}} from those denied Lincoln's presence. Abolitionist Thomas Wentworth Higginson described Hay as [...] "a nice young fellow, who unfortunately looks about seventeen and is oppressed with the necessity of behaving like seventy". Hay continued to write, anonymously, for newspapers, sending in columns calculated to make Lincoln appear a sorrowful man, religious and competent, giving of his life and health to preserve the Union. Similarly, Hay served as what Taliaferro deemed a [...] "White House propagandist", in his columns explaining away losses such as that at First Manassas in July 1861.|$|E
