50|$|Clay {{minerals}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} diverse minerals but all have a commonalty of crystal or grain sizes below 2 µm. Chemically clays are defined by crystal structure and chemical composition. Sometimes fine grain sediments are mistakenly describes as clays, this is actually a description of the “clay-size fraction” rather than the mineralogy of the sediment. There are three crystallographic clay groups: platy clays (phyllosilicates), <b>fibrous</b> <b>clay</b> minerals, and amorphous clay. Phyllosilicates are the most abundant clays and are categorized based on the layering of a tetrahedral and an octahedral layer. For most clays, the octahedral layer is centered with Al3+, Fe3+, or Mg(OH)2, but sometimes Zn2+, Li+, and Cr3+ can substitute as well. Si4+ is normally the center of the tetrahedral layer but Al3+ will often partially substitute and create a charge imbalance. Two-layer clays are composed of a tetrahedral layer and an octahedral layer (T-O) while three-layer clays contain an octahedral layer sandwiched by two tetrahedral layers (T-O-T). When substitution of Al3+ for Si4+ creates a charge imbalance, an interlayer cation will fill in between tetrahedral layers to balance the charge of the clay.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Veins of intimately {{associated}} fibrous and granular saponitic lay {{occur in}} a basalt quarry at Orrock, Fife, Scotland. Preliminary X-ray diffraction studies uggested that both fibrous and granular forms consisted of pure saponite but chemical and thermal studies showed the presence of subsidiary amounts of interstratified chlorite. The <b>fibrous</b> <b>clay,</b> which is strongly oriented around the a axis but with a uniform distribution of the b and c POleS. consists mainly of highly-crystalline laths with minor amounts of turbostratically-ordered particles. The granular clay consists of turbostratically-ordered particles only. The swelling behaviour of both types of clay in water and in ethylene glycol {{is similar to that}} of pure saponite. With glycerol, only the granular clay swells completely but the <b>fibrous</b> <b>clay</b> behaves similarly if first subjected to grinding or chemical pre-treatment. These observations are accounted for on the basis that the <b>fibrous</b> <b>clay</b> has better order than the granular form, thus enabling the interlamellar constituents to participate more fully in layer-to-layer bonding. The occurrence of fibrous saponite (or bowlingite) as vein fillings in extrusive basic igneous rocks has often been recorded.

Many soils in semi-arid areas contain palygorskite and a few also sepiolite (Singer, 1984).

Both geographical areas were compared with each other, then compared with the area south of Biscay Bay (Site 398, DSDP Leg 47). In Aptian to Paleogene sediments the clay fraction is dominated by smectite. In Biscay Bay the mineral is rich in Al-Fe and chiefly expresses the erosion of soils formed under arid-warm climatic conditions with contrasted wet and dry seasons. Two stages with <b>fibrous</b> <b>clays</b> occur in Albian (attapulgite, palygorskite) and Paleocene/Eocene (attapulgite, sepiolite) sediments, suggesting the existence of wet and warm periods and of nearly closed marginal basins. In the south part of the Iceland Sea the smectite is of a Fe-Mg type and mainly results from the transformation of volcanic material, probably in subaerial conditions. In post-Paleogene sediments the primary minerals (illite, chlorite, quartz, feldspars) and mixed-layers increase irregularly, expressing both periodic continental cooling, the major stages of which occurred in late Miocene and Pleistocene times, {{an increase in the}} intensity of the north/south oceanic current. In general, kaolinite and <b>fibrous</b> <b>clays</b> are less abundant, smectite more abundant, and coolings appear to have been stronger in Pleistocene time in the more northern drill sites. The diagenetic changes are unusual. There is no modification with depth of burial and no basic chemical sedimentation. An in situ evolution in volcanic environment appears locally in Rockall sites only. The "black shales " facies does not induce any argillaceous modification in north Biscay Bay and affects only some chemical elements such as Ca, Fe, and Mn.

These series consist of alternation of marl, dolomite, limestone, gypsum and phosphatic beds. Palygorskite currently constitutes more than 90 % of the clay fraction of these facies. The {{aim of this}} study is to characterise the structure and the physicochemical properties of these <b>fibrous</b> <b>clays.</b> Several technics were performed to characterise these clay sediments: X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns to study its crystal structure. XRF analysis was performed to study the chemical compositions. Differential thermogravimetric analyses (DTA) were used to study the weight loss due to dehydration and dehydroxylation. The microstructure of these <b>fibrous</b> <b>clays</b> is determined by transmission and scanning electron microscop (TEM/SEM). Physical properties were characterised using the plasticity index of Casagrande, the test for shear strength and the oedometer test. The parameter concerning the adsorption capacity of methylene blue is also determined. The palygorskite clays of the Marrakech High Atlas consist of a silty clay of uniform appearance, greyish in color, and very low organic plastic. The thickness of deposit varies from several meters to several hundred meters. SEM and TEM observations show that palygorskite clay minerals display bundle of long fibres wish occurs as interwoven fibrous mats forming the laminae and as coatings and pore-filling, and pore-bridging cements in dolomite. These fibres are characterized by Mg rich chemical compositions, high crystalline structure, high specific surface area and excellent sorptive capacity. XRD show reflections (110) at 10. 5 A, associated with all harmonics. The ATD curves show three endothermic peaks (100 - 200, 250 - 300 and 400 - 500 °C) corresponding to different dehydration process. A fourth exotherm peak often preceded by an endothermic reaction (800 - 900 °C) reflet the crystallization of new mineral phases including mullite. Palygorskite rich samples exhibit a high plasticity index of about 70. The swelling index generally increases with increasing content of palygorskite.

In arid landscapes, the way the soil sheds, admits, stores, diverts and transmits water is crucially important. Namaqualand's soils possess special features, which modify water infiltration, hydraulic conductivity and subsurface storage and provision of water to plants. These include pedodermal crusts; a natural mulch of surface gravel or desert pavement; water-repellent soils with fingered infiltration of rain water; textural discontinuities at depth; subsurface horizons cemented with silica, calcite, <b>fibrous</b> <b>clays</b> or gypsum; soluble salts that affect plant water uptake osmotically; clay minerals having exceptional water-absorbing capacity and that are unique to arid environments; and a mechanism, in deeper sandy soils, for thermally induced upward transport of water vapour-a kind of nocturnal distillation-that seems to lessen the need for plants to root deeply.

40|$|The <b>fibrous</b> <b>clay</b> {{minerals}} attapulgite and sepiolite {{have been}} subjected to hydrothermal reactions between 149 C (300 F) and 427 C (800 F). A 4 % suspension of each of these clays was autoclaved for 16 to 24 hours with and without the addition of salts of NaCl and KC 1 at 1 % concentration. These <b>fibrous</b> <b>clay</b> minerals start to convert at 204 C (400 F) to a smectite with a lamellar morphology. In fact, attapulgite converts more readily than sepiolite, and the attapulgite-to-smectite transformation is fully completed at 316 C (600 F), whereas 20 % to 50 % of the sepiolite remains intact at this temperature. The conversion of the fibrous double- and triple-chain silicates of attapulgite and sepiolite to a layered silicate, such as smectite, favorably affects the rheology of the drilling fluids based on these clays. The mechanism of the conversion is, however, different for these fibrous clays. Attapulgite dissolves first and then smectite precipitates whereas this mechanism takes place for sepiolite at 316 C (600 F). Both attapulgite and sepiolite, and their reaction products, have been examined with an analytical electron microscope (JEM- 100 CX) in TEM, STEM, SEM, and SAD modes. The intensities of the characteristic X-ray spectra for the elements Mg, Al, Si, Fe, Ca, and K are measured.

On one hand, the properties of both components may be coupled in the resulting material. On the other hand, a strong interaction at the interface may result in modified properties, adding potential to this synthetic strategy for the development of new functional materials. Organic–inorganic, [2, 3] organic–organic, [4, 5] as well as inorganic–inorganic heterostructures, [6, 7] recently including silica-sepiolite nanostructures, [8] have been reported. When the controlled arrangement of nanoscale structural units affords “a configuration that creates a novel functionality through mutual interactions among those units” the approach is termed “nanoarchitectonics” [9, 10, 11]. Within these systems, several clay-based nanoarchitectures of interest for adsorption and catalysis processes have been developed [12].

The highly smectitic composition of the I/S and its association with bentonite layers and zeolite minerals suggest that much of the I/S was derived from the alteration of volcanic material. The condensed middle to Upper Cretaceous sediments consist of palygorskite and detrital I/S that contains 30 % to 60 % illite layers. The condensed Paleogene sediments contain no palygorskite and are dominated by detrital clay minerals or by highly smectitic I/S associated with bentonite layers and zeolite minerals. The overlying, rapidly deposited Neogene clayey calcareous turbidites consist of three distinct clay mineral associations. Middle Miocene sediments contain palygorskite, kaolinite, and a tentatively identified mixed-layered illite/smectite/chlorite (I/S/C) or saponite. Upper Miocene sediments contain abundant sepiolite and kaolinite and lesser amounts of detrital I/S. Detrital I/S and kaolinite dominate the clay mineralogy of Pliocene and Pleistocene sediments. The <b>fibrous,</b> magnesium-rich <b>clay</b> minerals sepiolite and palygorskite appear to be authigenic and occur intimately associated with authigenic dolomite. The magnesium required to form these Mg-rich minerals was supplied by diffusion from the overlying seawater, and silica was supplied by the dissolution of associated biogenic silica...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this article is to {{understand}} the underlying mechanisms of the potential of nanohybrids. Two types of fillers were dispersed in a biocompatible organic matrix, poly-(hydroxyethyl acrylate) (PHEA) : either a natural <b>fibrous</b> <b>clay</b> (pristine sepiolite), or a natural nanopigment (Maya Blue). In comparison with the pure polymer, the mechanical properties of the composites have been already greatly improved with the addition a small amount of Maya Blue. However the PHEA/pristine sepiolite nanohybrid gives better results than the PHEA/Maya Blue for the same ratio of fillers. The stress-strain curves (with unloading and reloading) show that the presence of indigo modifies the interactions between the filler and the matrix. These analyses demonstrate that there is a direct correlation between the filler/matrix local interactions, the dispersion of the fillers and some macroscopical mechanical properties...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] In vitro {{studies of}} the {{destruction}} (lysis) of bovine red blood cells (erythrocytes) by some silicate minerals howed the reaction to be complete in less than 1 hr and very destructive tothe cell membrane. The activity as lysing agents {{was found to be}} in the order smectites> silica> palygorskite-~sepiolite> chrysotile> kaolinite. Different compositions (Fe, A 1, Mg, Li, vacancy) of the octahedral sheet of the smectite and <b>fibrous</b> <b>clay</b> minerals did not appreciably alter their hemolytic activity. The most active particle size range for kaolinite and montmoriUonite was 0. 2 - 2 ~m. Structural folding of palygorskite reduced lysis suggesting that edge surfaces and silanol groups are important in this process. Aluminum oxides and hydroxides caused no lysis, and coatings of positively charged aluminum-hydroxy polymers on montmorillonite, silica, palygorskite, and kaolinite significantly reduced lysis...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} the soiling behavior of solar energy systems like photovoltaics or concentrated solar power, glass samples {{were exposed to}} outdoor conditions in Doha, Qatar for one month. Soil formation on the glass was characterized at microstructural level using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Further, elemental analysis of the crust was done with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Small fibrous structures {{were found on the}} glass surface and dust particles, providing evidence of a cementation process leading to a strong adhesion of airborne dust particles. In contrast to the common perception, that cementation occurs via the precipitation of salt (sodium chloride) these needle structures were found to be mainly composed of oxides of Si, Mg and Al. This indicates that cementation processes in desert regions are enhanced by the growth of <b>fibrous</b> <b>clay</b> minerals...|$|E
40|$|Groundwork results {{showing the}} {{possibility}} of applying supported graphene materials prepared from natural resources {{in the use of}} clean energy are introduced here. These nanomaterials were generated in an ecofriendly approach from caramel adsorbed on the <b>fibrous</b> and porous <b>clay</b> mineral sepiolite, which was thermally treated at relatively moderate temperature in the absence of oxygen. The supported graphenes produced in this way exhibit good electrical conductivity and an elevated specific surface area, making them excellent candidates as electrodes for storage devices such as Li-ion batteries and supercapacitors. In this way, electrochemical cells involving supported graphenes as anode materials and lithium metal as cathode material were successfully tested in model Li-rechargeable batteries, which exhibited specific capacity values close to 400 mA h/g and enhanced cyclability behavior. In the same way, the use of clay-supported graphenes in supercapacitors was tested showing specific capacity values higher than 30 F/g. In addition, these carbon nanomaterials can act as adsorbents for hydrogen storage, achieving at 77 K and 40 MPa adsorption capacities above 0. 6 wt. % of hydrogen related to the total mass of the system and a maximum value close to 1. 7 wt. % of hydrogen specifically related to the carbon mass. © 2014 by American Scientific Publishers.

40|$|Five geomorphic {{surfaces}} {{present in}} the northern Pahranagat Valley, Lincoln County, Nevada {{range in age from}} Early Pleistocene to Recent (Q 1 -Q 5) and vary in clast lithology from dolomite to volcanic tephras. Two chronosequences and 5 lithosequences were compared to evaluate micro and macromorphic characteristics and development of soil pendants. This study presents a new interpretation for soil pendant development. Key features observed in the Pahranagat Valley pendants provide evidence for precipitation at the clast-pendant contact suggesting that newer deposits are not always found at the pendant terminus as other studies have assumed. These features include a void at the clast-pendant contact where precipitates such as calcium carbonate, silica and/or fibrous silicate clays may precipitate. Other features {{present in the}}se pendants include significant amounts of parent clast grains that are incorporated into the pendant, detrital grain and parent material displacement and/or dissolution and presence of the <b>fibrous</b> <b>clay</b> sepiolite...|$|E
40|$|Palygorskite is <b>fibrous</b> <b>clay</b> {{in which}} the {{structural}} tetrahedral and octahedral layers are organized {{in a way that}} structural channels are formed, leading to high surface area. However, impurities inside the channels and aggregated ones considerably reduce the available area. In order to increase the surface area, an activation treatment can be considered useful. The goal of this work is the activation of palygorskite from Guadalupe, Piauí, via sulfuric acid treatment using a two-level factorial design. The influence of three parameters (solution molarity, temperature and time) on BET surface area was determined. Moreover, samples were characterized via X-ray diffraction (XRD) and fluorescence (XRF), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The largest surface area (282 m 2 /g) without considerable changes in clay structure and morphology was found in a sample treated with 5 M H 2 SO 4 at 70 °C for 1 h. The main parameters that favored the improvement of the surface area were the solution’s molarity, temperature and their interaction...|$|E
