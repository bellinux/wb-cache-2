5|$|The hoop snake, a {{creature}} of legend in the United States and Australia, is said to grasp its tail in its mouth and roll like a wheel towards its prey. Japanese culture includes a similar mythical creature, the Tsuchinoko. Buer, a demon mentioned in the 16th-century grimoire Pseudomonarchia Daemonum, was described and illustrated in Collin de Plancy's Dictionnaire Infernal as having radially-arranged arms on which <b>it</b> <b>rolled.</b>|$|E
5|$|On May 28, Bonds passed Ruth, {{hitting his}} 715th career home run to center field off Colorado Rockies pitcher Byung-hyun Kim. The ball was hit an {{estimated}} 445feet (140m) into center field where {{it went through}} the hands of several fans but then fell onto an elevated platform in center field. Then <b>it</b> <b>rolled</b> off the platform where Andrew Morbitzer, a 38-year-old San Francisco resident, caught the ball {{while he was in}} line at a concession stand. Mysteriously, radio broadcaster Dave Flemming's radio play-by-play of the home run went silent just as the ball was hit, apparently from a microphone failure. But the televised version, called by Giants broadcaster Duane Kuiper, was not affected.|$|E
5|$|On 4 March 1941, Pattle claimed three enemy Fiat G.50bis fighters (nos 22–24) {{belonging}} to 24oGruppo. He claimed the first, while Nigel Cullen — another leading fighter ace — flew as his wingman. Escorting Blenheims to attack Italian warships, the pair were engaged by a lone G.50. Pattle engaged the Fiat and shot it down — its landing gear dropped down and <b>it</b> <b>rolled</b> over {{and into a}} mountainside just north of Himare. Pattle searched for Cullen, expecting him to be behind him but saw {{no sign of the}} Australian. He assumed Cullen had gone off to scout for more enemy aircraft after missing out on Pattle's victory. Now alone, he was attacked by another lone G.50bis while flying towards Vlorë. After a brief combat, he shot down the Fiat. It crashed into the sea southwest of Vlorë harbour. He then became involved with a third such fighter over Valona harbour and claimed to have shot this down into the sea in flames {{on the west side of}} the promontory. After his return to base, he was informed Cullen had been posted missing in action. Pattle and the squadron considered he had most likely been shot down and killed.|$|E

50|$|The common {{analogy is}} with the rolling of a snowball down a snow-covered hillside. As <b>it</b> <b>rolls</b> the ball will pick up more snow, gaining more mass and surface area, and picking up even more snow and {{momentum}} as <b>it</b> <b>rolls</b> along.|$|R
5|$|These flights covered {{performance}} tests {{such as we}} do on planes undergoing Navy tests. The very first flight exposed weaknesses of the Zero which our pilots could exploit with proper tactics... immediately apparent {{was the fact that}} the ailerons froze up at speeds above 200 knots so that rolling maneuvers at those speeds were slow and required much force on the control stick. <b>It</b> <b>rolled</b> to the left much easier than to the right. Also, its engine cut out under negative acceleration due to its float-type carburetor. We now had the answer for our pilots who were being outmaneuvered and unable to escape a pursuing Zero: Go into a vertical power dive, using negative acceleration if possible to open the range while the Zero's engine was stopped by the acceleration. At about 200 knots, roll hard right before the Zero pilot could get his sights lined up.|$|E

The {{aircraft}} then {{came to rest on}} the left wing and suffered substantial damage. The aircraft was repaired and returned to service. The cause of the accident was that a hammer, lodged between the inboard drag strut and sliding member, caused the landing gear to collapse.|$|E

25|$|At around 1:00 AM on 18 August in Cambrils, {{the five}} men drove an Audi A3 {{automobile}} into {{a crowd of}} pedestrians before <b>it</b> <b>rolled</b> over {{at the intersection of}} Passeig Miramar, Passeig Marítim and Rambla de Jaume I streets. The five individuals inside were wearing fake suicide vests, and attacked bystanders with knives. A 63-year-old Spanish woman was stabbed to death. Six other people were injured in the attack, including a Cuban tourist and a police officer.|$|E
25|$|Gateshead 52 was {{originally}} a single-deck 'California' style tram until the open end compartments were covered over around 1903. Was {{involved in an}} accident in 1916 after <b>it</b> <b>rolled</b> down a steep hill with passengers on board. After this it was rebuilt to its present format and was withdrawn in 1951. Bought by its former driver, it passed to the National Tramway Museum on his death, where it was stored, and damaged in an arson attack. It was transferred to Beamish in 2014, with a full restoration planned.|$|E
25|$|On 19 January 2008, a 3rdInfantry Division U.S. Army soldier {{operating}} as the exposed turret gunner, {{was killed in}} a Navistar MaxxPro MRAP vehicle by an ANFO IED estimated at 600lb. It is unknown whether the gunner was killed by the explosion or by the vehicle when <b>it</b> <b>rolled</b> over after the blast. The vehicle’s v-hull was not compromised. The crew compartment also appeared to be uncompromised, and the three other crew members inside the vehicle survived; one with a shattered left foot, a broken nose and several broken teeth; one with a fractured foot; and the third physically unharmed.|$|E

25|$|One witness {{interviewed by}} the NTSB, a pilot driving on a road {{southwest}} of the airport, told investigators that he saw the airplane in normal flight at normal altitudes, and that {{he believed that the}} approach was not abnormal. The airplane completed a 180-degree turn from the downwind leg of the approach and continued the turn. He then saw the aircraft pitch slightly, before <b>it</b> <b>rolled</b> to the left until the wings were vertical. The airplane then turned nose-down and smashed into the ground. He saw no fire or smoke during the flight and he believed both propellers were rotating.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the company}} in the train were four ladies, who are deserving of honourable mention, from the courage they {{displayed}} in accompanying it, namely, Mrs. Nichs. Wood, and Miss F. Wood, Mrs. I. L. Bell, and her sister, Miss Pattinson of Washington. As the train passed steadily over the bridge the anxiety of the immense multitude seemed intense, and the scene was truly exciting, yet fearful—not only from the lofty eminence occupied by the train, but, from the apparent narrowness and nakedness of the platform on which <b>it</b> <b>rolled</b> along. It seemed from its noiselessness, rather an aerial flight, than the rattling sweep of the iron horse.|$|E
25|$|It {{was against}} {{regulations}} for officers {{to drive a}} convoy vehicle, but First Lieutenant Ben Keating took the wheel while returning an armored supply truck to the Naray FOB. He wanted to avoid risking {{the lives of his}} men while traveling on an unstable road subject to ambush with an overweight vehicle. During the highly risky convoy, the road collapsed under the weight of Keating's vehicle. He was thrown from the truck and <b>it</b> <b>rolled</b> over him and sank into the Landay-Sin river. His death had a traumatic effect on the morale of 3-71 Cav. The Allies stopped using the Kamdesh-Naray road as a result.|$|E

In the next inning, Hilldale added on. With two outs, Stephens grounded to short and beat out Moore's throw. He then stole second and advanced to third on a passed ball. Briggs singled to right, scoring Stephens. In the bottom of the seventh, Sweatt led off with a hit to right. After Duncan struck out, Drake hit a fly ball to center, which the wind caused George Johnson to misjudge; when <b>it</b> <b>rolled</b> away, Drake reached third with a triple, driving in Sweatt, and narrowing Hilldale's lead to 3–2.|$|E
25|$|On September 21, 2005, JetBlue Flight 292, an Airbus A320 {{discovered}} {{a problem with}} its landing gear as it took off from Bob Hope Airport in Burbank, California. It flew in circles for three hours to burn off fuel, then landed safely at Los Angeles International Airport on runway 25L, balancing on its back wheels as <b>it</b> <b>rolled</b> {{down the center of}} the runway. Passengers were able to watch their own coverage live from the satellite broadcast on JetBlue in-flight TV seat displays of their plane as it made an emergency landing with the front landing gear visibly becoming damaged. Because JetBlue did not serve LAX at the time, the aircraft was evaluated and repaired at a Continental Airlines hangar.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of January 25, 1875, Pinkerton agents {{surrounded}} the James farm in Kearney, Missouri. Frank and Jesse James had been there earlier but had already left. When the Pinkertons threw an iron incendiary device into the house, it exploded when <b>it</b> <b>rolled</b> into a blazing fireplace. The blast nearly severed the right arm of Zerelda Samuel, the James boys' mother (the arm had to be amputated at the elbow that night), and killed their 9-year-old half-brother, Archie Samuel. On April 12, 1875, an unknown gunman shot dead Daniel Askew, a neighbor and former Union militiaman {{who may have been}} suspected of providing the Pinkertons with a base for their raid. Allan Pinkerton then abandoned the chase for the James–Younger Gang.|$|E
