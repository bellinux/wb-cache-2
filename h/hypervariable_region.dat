5|$|Though {{the general}} {{structure}} of all antibodies is very similar, a small region {{at the tip}} of the protein is extremely variable, allowing millions of antibodies with slightly different tip structures, or antigen-binding sites, to exist. This region is known as the <b>hypervariable</b> <b>region.</b> Each of these variants can bind to a different antigen. This enormous diversity of antibody paratopes on the antigen-binding fragments allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens. The large and diverse population of antibody paratope is generated by random recombination events of a set of gene segments that encode different antigen-binding sites (or paratopes), followed by random mutations in this area of the antibody gene, which create further diversity. This recombinational process that produces clonal antibody paratope diversity is called V(D)J or VJ recombination. Basically, the antibody paratope is polygenic, made up of three genes, V, D, and J. Each paratope locus is also polymorphic, such that during antibody production, one allele of V, one of D, and one of J is chosen. These gene segments are then joined together using random genetic recombination to produce the paratope. The regions where the genes are randomly recombined together is the hyper variable region used to recognise different antigens on a clonal basis.|$|E

The mtDNA sequences of the HVR I (<b>hypervariable</b> <b>region</b> I) from Okladnikov 2 confirmed that the individual was Neanderthal. On the basis of mtDNA analysis, Okladnikov 2 {{was found to be}} more related to European and western Asian Neanderthals. A 2014 re-analysis teasing out ancient DNA from contaminated sequences allowed researchers to complete the mtDNA sequence from Okladnikov 2. The completed sequence shows that the Okladnikov 2 mtDNA is basal to that sequenced from Mezmaiskaya 1 from Mezmaiskaya Cave and is even closer to western Neanderthals than previously thought.|$|E
25|$|To {{determine}} which epitopes are shared between pathogen and self, large protein databases are used. The largest protein database in the world, {{known as the}} UniProt database (formerly SwissProt), has shown reports of molecular mimicry becoming more common with expansion of the database. The database currently contains 1.5 X 107 residues. The probability of finding a perfect match with a motif of 5 amino acids in length is 1 in 3.7 X 10−7 (0.055). Therefore, within the SwissProt database, {{one would expect to}} find 1.5 X 107 X 3.7 X 10−7 = 5 matches. However, there are sequence motifs within the database that are overrepresented and are found more than 5 times. For example, the QKRAA sequence is an amino acid motif in the third <b>hypervariable</b> <b>region</b> of HLA-DRB1*0401. This motif is also expressed on numerous other proteins, such as on gp110 of the Epstein-Barr virus and in E. coli. This motif occurs 37 times in the database. This would suggest that the linear amino acid sequence may not be an underlying cause of molecular mimicry since it can be found numerous times within the database. The possibility exists, then, for variability within amino acid sequence, but similarity in three-dimensional structure between two peptides can be recognized by T cell clones. This, therefore, uncovers a flaw of such large databases. They may be able to give a hint to relationships between epitopes, but the important three-dimensional structure cannot yet be searched for in such a database.|$|E

50|$|The {{bacterial}} 16S gene contains nine <b>hypervariable</b> <b>regions</b> (V1-V9) {{ranging from}} about 30-100 base pairs long {{that are involved}} in the secondary structure of the small ribosomal subunit. The degree of conservation varies widely between <b>hypervariable</b> <b>regions,</b> with more conserved regions correlating to higher-level taxonomy and less conserved regions to lower levels, such as genus and species. While the entire 16S sequence allows for comparison of all <b>hypervariable</b> <b>regions,</b> at approximately 1500 base pairs long it can be prohibitively expensive for studies seeking to identify or characterize diverse bacterial communities. These studies commonly utilize the Illumina platform, which produces reads at rates 50-fold and 12,000-fold less expensive than 454 pyrosequencing and Sanger sequencing, respectively. While cheaper and allowing for deeper community coverage, Illumina sequencing only produces reads 75-150 base pairs long, and has no established protocol for reliably assembling the full gene in community samples. Full <b>hypervariable</b> <b>regions</b> can be assembled from a single Illumina run, however, making them ideal targets for the platform.|$|R

40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 evolves rapidly, and random base change {{is thought to}} act as a major factor in this evolution. However, segments of the viral genome differ in their variability: there is the highly variable env gene, particularly <b>hypervariable</b> <b>regions</b> located within env, and, in contrast, the conservative gag and pol genes. Computer analysis of the nucleotide sequences of human {{immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 isolates reveals that base substitution in this virus is nonrandom and affected by local nucleotide sequences. Certain local sequences 6 base pairs long are excessively frequent in the <b>hypervariable</b> <b>regions.</b> These sequences exhibit base-substitution hotspots at specific positions in their 6 bases. The hotspots tend to be nonsilent letters of codons in the <b>hypervariable</b> <b>regions</b> [...] thus leading to marked amino acid substitutions there. Conversely, in the conservative gag and pol genes the hotspots tend to be silent letters because of a difference in codon frame from the <b>hypervariable</b> <b>regions.</b> Furthermore, base substitutions in the local sequences that frequently appear in the conservative genes occurred at a low level, even within the variable env. Thus, despite the high variability of this virus, the conservative genes and their products could be conserved. These may be some of the strategies evolved in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 to allow for positive-selection pressures, such as the host immune system, and negative-selection pressures on the conservative gene products...|$|R
