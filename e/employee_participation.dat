40|$|In {{this paper}} <b>employee</b> {{financial}} <b>participation</b> (EFP) is investigated {{in the context}} of the enterprise bargaining principle. It is argued that <b>employee</b> financial <b>participation</b> should be seen as a logical consequence of the decentralisation of the industrial relations system. This is the case as the rationale for enterprise bargaining has been the need for workplace reform and demand for increased productivity at the enterprise level. <b>Employee</b> financial <b>participation</b> on a collective basis can also materially afford employees opportunities to participate at a high level in the decision-making processes of an organisation. <b>Employee</b> financial <b>participation</b> will be also be assessed {{in the context of}} (strategic) human resource management (HRM). The type of business strategy and consequent HRM taxonomy will have a congruent type of EFP implemented in the workplace. The industry incidence and the "contingencies" of <b>employee</b> financial <b>participation</b> are considered. Specifically the context in which companies implementing these strategies are assessed, for example, does <b>employee</b> financial <b>participation</b> exist within the context of other innovations. The literature suggests that the implementation of an <b>employee</b> financial <b>participation</b> scheme is not an isolated event and will co-exist with other "best practice" initiatives such as team based work. Conversely, it is also possible that such strategies could exist alone and at the expense of other workplace innovations (Mathews 1994), which mirrors the archetypical human resource practices that are aligned with different types of competitive business strategies as defined by Schuler and Jackson (1987). The enterprise agreements used in this investigation draws upon agreements (EBAs) held on the Australian Centre for Industrial Relations Research and Teaching (ACIRRT) database (Agreements Database and Monitor: ADAM). From a total of 3747 state and federal agreements, it was found that 147 had an <b>employee</b> financial <b>participation</b> component (3. 9 %). The contents of these 147 enterprise agreements were analysed to ascertain whether there were any other "best practice" initiatives present.

Moreover, under the European Company Statute, businesses that reincorporate as a Societas Europaea may opt to follow the Directive for employee involvement.

In the 1977 Report of the committee of inquiry on industrial democracy the Government proposed, in line with the new German Codetermination Act 1976, and mirroring an EU Draft Fifth Company Law Directive, that the board of directors should have an equal number of representatives elected by employees as there were for shareholders. But reform stalled, and was abandoned after the 1979 election. Despite successful businesses like the John Lewis Partnership and Waitrose that are wholly managed and owned by the workforce, voluntary granting of participation is rare. Many businesses run employee share schemes, particularly for highly paid employees; however, such shares seldom compose more than a small percentage of capital in the company, and these investments entail heavy risks for workers, given the lack of diversification.|$|E
2500|$|Probably {{the most}} {{fundamental}} guarantee that directors will act in the members' interests {{is that they can}} easily be sacked. During the Great Depression, two Harvard scholars, Adolf Berle and Gardiner Means wrote The Modern Corporation and Private Property, an attack on American law which failed to hold directors to account, and linked the growing power and autonomy of directors to the economic crisis. In the UK, the right of members to remove directors by a simple majority is assured under s.168 CA 2006 Moreover, Art.21 of the Model Articles requires a third of the board to put themselves up for re-election every year (in effect creating maximum three year terms). 10% of shareholders can demand a meeting any time, and 5% can if it has been a year since the last one (s.303 CA 2006). In Germany, where <b>employee</b> <b>participation</b> creates the need for greater boardroom stability, §84(3) AktG states that management board directors can only be removed by the supervisory board for an important reason (ein wichtiger Grund) though this can include a vote of no-confidence by the shareholders. Terms last for five years, unless 75% of shareholders vote otherwise. §122 AktG lets 10% of shareholders demand a meeting. In the US, Delaware lets directors enjoy considerable autonomy. §141(k) DGCL states that directors can be removed without any cause, unless the board is [...] "classified", meaning that directors only come up for re-appointment on different years. If the board is classified, then directors cannot be removed unless there is gross misconduct. Director's autonomy from shareholders is seen further in §216 DGCL, which allows for plurality voting and §211(d) which states shareholder meetings can only be called if the constitution allows for it. The problem is that in America, directors usually choose where a company is incorporated and §242(b)(1) DGCL says any constitutional amendment requires a resolution by the directors. By contrast, constitutional amendments can be made at any time by 75% of shareholders in Germany (§179 AktG) and the UK (s.21 CA 2006).|$|E
