40|$|The {{most recent}} {{studies on the}} {{applications}} of nanostructured carbon materials, including carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, and graphene oxides, <b>in</b> <b>constructions</b> are presented. First, the preparation of nanostructured carbon/infrastructure material composites is summarized. This part is mainly focused on how the nanostructured carbon materials were mixed with cementitious or asphalt matrix to realize a good dispersion condition. Several methods, including high speed melting mixing, surface treatment, and aqueous solution with surfactants and sonication, were introduced. Second, the applications of the carbon nanostructured materials <b>in</b> <b>constructions</b> such as mechanical reinforcement, self-sensing detectors, self-heating element for deicing, and electromagnetic shielding component were systematically reviewed. This paper not only helps the readers understand the preparation process of the carbon nanostructured materials/infrastructure material composites but also sheds {{some light on the}} state-of-the-art applications of carbon nanostructured materials <b>in</b> <b>constructions...</b>|$|R
