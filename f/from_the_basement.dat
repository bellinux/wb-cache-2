5|$|In August 2007, {{the stadium}} was {{planned to be}} built in three stages, with a {{combined}} budget of NOK156.6 million. The first stage would involve the northern and western sides and cost NOK78.4 million, the second stage would involve the eastern side and cost NOK43.0 million, while the third stage would involve the southern side and cost NOK35.1 million. After construction started, BG changed two specifications, moving public rest rooms <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> to the ground floor, and changing the angle of roof.

5|$|In 1872 a major {{programme}} of building works was undertaken to a design by Edward Middleton Barry. This provided {{a roof over}} the central court of the Exchange and a new suite of offices {{on the first floor}} above the colonnades around the court. Other internal alterations appear to {{have been made in the}} late 19th century, possibly also by Barry in 1872. This is uncertain as Barry's plans are yet to be found. Further extensive alterations were made in the 1900s when the City Valuer's Department moved to the Exchange in 1907. These included the provision of a lift <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> and cellars to the first floor and major alterations to the cellars under the central part of the Exchange. Since 1945 further alterations have included the replacement of the roof over the central court by a temporary roof at a lower level, the removal of the clock tower at the back of the building and the internal rebuilding of all four floors of the coffeehouse together with the corresponding floors over the main entrance.|$|E
5|$|To {{help get}} the Rohm and Haas Corporate Headquarters {{listed as a}} landmark, RMJM Hillier and Rohm and Haas focused renovations on opening up floor space and modernizing systems. A part of the {{original}} plan that altered the building's facade was abandoned, but the facade received a thorough cleaning. Inside, most of the enclosed office space was removed and replaced with open workstations. The new layout was also designed to let more light into the interior of the building. The work spaces also received new furniture, which replaced some that dated back to the 1960s. The dining area was moved <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> to street level in a space that was previously occupied by a bank, but had lain vacant for several years. Security, telecommunications, and central plant systems were also upgraded and modernized. The interior renovations finished around May 2008, with improvements to the surrounding plaza completed several months later.|$|E
5|$|In Reverse/Rebirth, Riku {{has been}} transported from {{the realm of}} {{darkness}} and fights his inner darkness as he battles upward <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> levels of Castle Oblivion. Vexen fights Riku to obtain his data and creates the replica of him to counter Marluxia's plan. Ansem, still possessing Riku's body, tries to regain control of Riku, but Mickey's power keeps Ansem at bay. On the way, Riku battles and defeats Lexaeus, a member of Vexen's circle, only to be dragged into the realm of darkness. However, he is saved by King Mickey when Ansem nearly succeeds in taking Riku's body as his own. With Marluxia eliminated by this time, another of Vexen's allies, Zexion, attempts to dispose of Riku by drowning him in light. Riku is saved by Naminé disguised as Kairi, who helps him to control his darkness, allowing him to defeat Zexion. Riku later meets DiZ, an enigmatic individual interested in Riku who sends him to find Naminé. Riku's replica, who has since learned of his altered memories and seeks to justify his existence, fights Riku only to be destroyed by him. Riku chooses to face Ansem upon learning from Naminé that Ansem lives in his heart, and defeats him after DiZ summons him for Riku to fight. Riku then sets out on a journey to utilize both his darkness and his light with King Mickey as his companion.|$|E
