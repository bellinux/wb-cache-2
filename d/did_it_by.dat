2500|$|By contrast, György Ligeti {{published}} {{a detailed analysis}} of the first chapter of this last piece in 1958, concluding that its [...] "ascetic attitude [...] akin to compulsion neurosis", and that Boulez [...] "had to break away from it... and so he created the sensual, feline world of the Marteau." [...] Speaking of Structures, Book I in 2011 Boulez described it as a piece in which [...] "the responsibility of the composer is practically absent. Had computers existed at that time I would have put the data through them and made the piece that way. But I <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>by</b> hand ... It was a demonstration through the absurd." [...] Asked whether it should still be listened to as music, Boulez replied: [...] "I am not terribly eager to listen to it. But for me it was an experiment that was absolutely necessary." ...|$|E
2500|$|Released on {{the same}} day as the album was Bob Dylan's Blonde on Blonde, which Leibovitz calls [...] "two strands in the same conversation, the one that turned American popular music, for one {{fleeting}} moment of one year in the middle 1960s, into a religious movement". Author Geoffrey Himes relates Wilson's achievements to Dylan's: [...] "The challenge for the pop songwriter is to mirror real life's conflicts in the song and still deliver the satisfying resolution pop music requires. Bob Dylan <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>by</b> introducing irony into rock'n'roll lyrics, and Brian's introduction of non-standard harmonies and timbres proved just as revolutionary... Most pop music unifies its lyric, melodic, harmonic and rhythmic devices so it can communicate one simple emotion as powerfully as possible.... This unified approach can be quite satisfying, but it can't reflect the complications of adult emotions in real life." ...|$|E

2500|$|She enjoyed {{climbing}} so {{much that}} she moved to Colorado where she was an exchange student at Colorado State University (CSU) for a year. She graduated with a bachelor's degree from the University of Maryland and then moved to Colorado and attended CSU to get a master's degree in English. Her thesis focused on the canon of mountaineering literature and [...] "the ways in which reality can be so disparate and shifting for each individual who is living through extreme circumstances", as Davis describes it. She considered attending PhD programs in English but decided against it. She attended University of Colorado's law school, but after five days in September 1995 she quit, knowing it was not the life for her. Against the will of her parents, she decided to pursue her passion for climbing. Davis' mother, Connie, said [...] "It was a big shock.

[...] He told the CPAC audience that he arrived in Washington as [...] "a foot soldier in the Reagan Revolution", and addressed the issue of illegal immigration - one of the major issues where conservatives have attacked McCain. He said that [...] "it would be among my highest priorities to secure our borders first", before addressing other immigration laws. [...] Mike Huckabee spoke to CPAC two days later and said, [...] "I know that there was some speculation that I might come here today to announce that I would be getting out of the race. But I {{want to make sure you}} understand. Am I quitting? Well, let's get that settled right now. No, I'm not. And the reason is simple—I never learned arithmetic. You see folks, while I didn't get a college degree in mathematics and writing, I majored in miracles. Mathematically impossible miracles. It is because I go back to that which helped crystallize in me a conservative viewpoint as a teenager when it wasn't easy or popular to be a Republican or a conservative in my hometown, because I do believe that America is about making choices, not simply echoing that of others. Let others join the [...] "Me, too" [...] crowd. But I didn't get where I am today and I didn't fight the battles in a state that, when I became its governor, was 90 percent Democrat, by simply echoing the voices of others. I <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>by</b> staking out a choice, stating that choice, making that choice and fighting for that choice, to believe that some things were right, some things were wrong, and it's better to be right and even to not win than it is to be wrong and to be a part of the crowd." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was in 1896 that D. Ward King first {{dragged the}} road with an old frostbitten pump stock and an oak post. The {{improvement}} in the dirt roads it worked was dramatic. Until then, {{the only way to}} firm up dirt roads had been to dump layers of stone on them and then press it in with a heavy roller to make a road surface resistant to turning into muck after every rain. This method was fairly effective, but it was also labor-intensive and expensive. These stone-permeated roads were called [...] "macadamized roads". These roads took their name from their Scotch inventor, John Loudon McAdam. Using his method, roads were covered with several layers of stone, starting with large ones and then reducing their size in each successive layer. The stones in the first level would be {{about the size of a}} human head. The stones in the next layer would be about the size of a fist. The final layer would be of stones of about the size of golf balls. It was grueling work to haul this heavy stone to the places needed, to unload it in the right places and then to spread it evenly over the road surface with only horse-drawn wagons and hand-held shovels and rakes. Further, in the days before powered stone crushers, there was the additional and very arduous task of smashing much bigger rocks down to the right size for use in the respective layers. This work came to be known as [...] "making the big ones into the small ones." [...] Men <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>by</b> hand by smashing large rocks with sledgehammers. In many states, convicts did this work and sometimes even built these macadamized roads by working on the roads themselves. When these convict crews worked directly on these roads, necessarily outside the walls of the prison, each man was typically chained to the next to prevent runaways. These convict road crews became the infamous [...] "chain gangs" [...] of that day. In the days of horse power, this method was just too time-consuming and expensive to be practical for widespread use.|$|E
