40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that <b>elderberry</b> (Sambucus nigra) has many positive health benefits, {{some of which}} might slow the rate of cancer growth. The objective {{of this research is}} to identify active components of <b>elderberry</b> capable of modulating melanoma cell proliferation in both in vitro experiments and in an in vivo murine model. Melanoma is of interest because incidence of melanoma increases annually and treatment of melanoma is crucial before stages of metastasis. A diet including <b>elderberry</b> extracts may be a naturopathic strategy to slow melanoma growth in at-risk patients, including elderly and immune-suppressed individuals. In a murine model, groups of mice were given intraperitoneal injections of either sterile water (control) or sterile crude <b>elderberry</b> (treatment) before challenge by murine melanoma. 13 days following successful cancer cell challenge, mice were sacrificed and tumor size and weight were recorded. On average, control mice had larger tumors compared to treatment mice in both tumor size and weight. Also, two out of three control mouse tumors metastasized into the peritoneal cavity (whereas all treatment mouse tumors remained local), suggesting that crude <b>elderberry</b> may also decrease risk of tumor metastasis. <b>Elderberry</b> extracts were separated and purified. Human melanoma (MeWo) cells were supplemented with individual <b>elderberry</b> fractions to examine tumor suppressive activity by radioactive thymidine uptake assays. Several <b>elderberry</b> fractions showed in vitro evidence of decreased melanoma proliferation and were pooled based upon similar suppressive abilities. These pooled fractions suppressed human neuroblastoma (SH- 545 Y) and murine melanoma (B 16 F 10) growth in vitro, suggesting that pooled <b>elderberry</b> fractions are effective in suppressing multiple lines of cancers. I am currently preparing active pooled <b>elderberry</b> fractions to use in a similar murine model. Proper identification of melanoma-suppressing <b>elderberry</b> fractions may lead to diet-based strategies for natural suppression of melanoma. [URL]...|$|R

25|$|The main {{food source}} for the Crow was the American bison which was hunted {{in a variety of}} ways. Before the use of horses the bison were hunted on foot and {{required}} hunters to stalk close to the bison, often with a wolf-pelt disguise, then pursue the animals quickly on foot before killing them with arrows or lances. The horse allowed the Crow to hunt bison more easily as well as hunt more at one time. Riders would panic the herd into a stampede and shoot the targeted animals with arrows or bullets from horseback or lance them through the heart. In addition to bison the Crow also hunted bighorn sheep, mountain goats, deer, elk, bear, and other game. Buffalo meat was often roasted or boiled in a stew with prairie turnips. The rump, tongue, liver, heart, and kidneys all were considered delicacies. Dried bison meat was ground with fat and berries to make pemmican.

40|$|Abstract Societal {{constraints}} often limit full process restoration {{in large}} river systems, making local rehabilita-tion activities valuable for regeneration of riparian vegetation. A target of much mitigation and restoration is the federally threatened Valley <b>elderberry</b> longhorn beetle and its sole host plant, blue <b>elderberry,</b> in upper riparian floodplain environments. However, blue <b>elderberry</b> ecol-ogy {{is not well}} understood and restoration attempts typically have low success rates. We determined broad-scale habitat characteristics of <b>elderberry</b> in altered systems and examined associated plant species composition in remnant habitat. We quantified vegetation community composition in 139 remnant riparian forest patches along the Sacramento River and <b>elderberry</b> stem diameters along this and four adjacent rivers. The greatest proportion of plots containing <b>elderberry</b> was located on higher and older floodplain surfaces and in riparian woodlands dominated by black walnut. Blue <b>elderberry</b> saplings and shrubs with stems. 0 cm in diameter were rare, suggesting a lack of recruitment. A complex suite of vegetation was associated with blue <b>elderberry,</b> including several invasive species which are potentially outcompeting seedlings for light, water, or other resources.

This type of restoration frequently occurs on highly regulated rivers, where the natural processes that shape riparian plant communities have been modified and truncated. The truncation of river processes places importance on restoration planting designs, which must consider the heterogeneous nature of the environment, complex natural vegetation structure {{as well as the}} succession of plants adapted to fluvial systems. One of the largest riparian restoration efforts in the country is along the regulated Sacramento River in the Central Valley of California, where restoration targets imperiled xii wildlife such as the federally threatened Valley <b>elderberry</b> longhorn beetle (Desmocerus californicus dimorphus, VELB). The VELB is endemic to the Central Valley and specializes on facultative riparian blue <b>elderberry</b> shrubs. As a target species of the restoration, over 96, 000 <b>elderberry</b> shrubs have been planted in the last 16 years in a range of planting designs to create VELB habitat.

40|$|The {{incidence}} {{rates of}} melanoma {{continue to rise}} annually despite recent progression in cancer treatments. Cancer is the most prevalent amongst elderly individuals, where immunosenescence has compromised some immune function, and therefore decreased certain tumor detection abilities. Current tumor removal strategies include radiation, chemotherapy and surgical excision: treatments that aim to lower cancer cells, but may also affect normal cells in the process. In the case of chemotherapy, which targets and kills rapidly dividing cells, many immune cells are lowered as a side effect, leaving many patients immune-suppressed and more susceptible to infection. There {{is a need for}} naturopathic treatments capable of decreasing tumor cell proliferation without compromising the body 2 ̆ 7 s normal immune function. Extracts from <b>elderberry</b> (Sambucus nigra) may be able to satisfy this need. Previous reports suggest that phytochemicals, such as the ones present in <b>elderberry,</b> may stimulate the immune response by secretion of cytokines, provide antioxidant protection to prevent cellular damage, and inhibit tumor growth directly. ^ Our primary goal was to separate the active components of <b>elderberry</b> and assess their inhibitory effects on the growth of multiple cancerous and transformed cell lines, as well as characterize their effects on stimulation of T lymphocyte proliferation and IL- 2 secretion in vitro. Murine melanoma model experiments were also performed with crude <b>elderberry</b> and <b>elderberry</b> fractions to analyze the tumor-suppressive activity of <b>elderberry</b> treatments in vivo. Spleen cell proliferation and in vivo experiments were also performed with different aged groups of mice to uncover the tumor -inhibiting and immune-inducing effects of <b>elderberry</b> and active <b>elderberry</b> fractions on aged mice. Active <b>elderberry</b> fractions were then preliminarily identified. ^ All separated <b>elderberry</b> fractions were able to significantly suppress the growth of B 16 -F 10 murine melanoma and SH-SY 5 Y human neuroblastoma cells in vitro. Several separated fractions also inhibited growth of a human melanoma cell line, MeWo, and a transformed non-cancerous line, CHO-K 1. When incubated with concanavalin A (Con A, a known mitogen) and spleen cells from a middle aged and old mouse, separated fractions of <b>elderberry</b> did not increase proliferation above the positive control (cells incubated with con A only), however, they induced a larger proliferation response in the older mouse spleen cells. Three active fractions induced secretion of IL- 2 from spleen cells above the positive control. In general, mice induced to produce tumors developed smaller, localized tumors when treated with crude <b>elderberry</b> compared to mice treated with water, whose tumors were larger and metastatic. The active <b>elderberry</b> fractions were too potent to be successfully implemented in an in vivo experiment, and need to be diluted for future mouse model experiments. Of the four primary anthocyanins in <b>elderberry,</b> cyanidin 3 -sambubioside and cyanidin 3 -glucoside were identified as the major tumor-inhibiting, immune-inducing components in different active fractions separated from <b>elderberry.</b> ^ The positive benefits of active fractions on tumor suppression and potentially on modulation of immune-inducing mechanisms provide further support for the use of bioactive phytochemicals in preventative cancer treatment. ...|$|R
