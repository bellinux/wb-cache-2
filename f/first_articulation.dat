40|$|The aim of {{this chapter}} is to {{describe}} {{the evolution of the}} Misesian theory of interventionism from its <b>first</b> <b>articulations</b> by Ludwig von Mises to its modern reformulation by Murray N.

It will be argued that Mises's theory of interventionism has undergone substantive changes, by both Mises and Rothbard, and further that these changes can be called extensions and improvements. The changes are extensions of the scope of the concept of interventionism to an increasing variety of categories of government policy to which the original form of argument was applicable. They can be called improvements because it is only this more comprehensive concept of interventionism that can adequately fit into the analytical role that Mises tried to make it play in his overall theory of economic policy. 1 Origins of the Theory: Price Control The earliest discussion by Mises of interventionism was a short sectio...|$|R

5000|$|Congregationalist polity, or Congregational polity, often {{known as}} congregationalism, {{is a system}} of church {{governance}} ("ecclesiastical polity") in which every local church congregation is independent, ecclesiastically sovereign, or [...] "autonomous". Its <b>first</b> <b>articulation</b> in writing is the Cambridge Platform of 1648 in New England. Among those major Protestant Christian traditions that employ congregationalism are those Congregational Churches known by the [...] "Congregationalist" [...] name that descended from the Independent Reformed wing of the Anglo-American Puritan movement of the 17th century, Quakerism, the Baptist churches, {{and most of the}} groups brought about by the Anabaptist movement in Germany that migrated to the U.S. in the late 18th century, as well as the Congregational Methodist Church. More recent generations have witnessed also a growing number of non-denominational churches, which are most often congregationalist in their governance. In Christianity, congregationalism is distinguished most clearly from episcopal polity, which is governance by a hierarchy of bishops. But it is also distinct from presbyterian polity, in which higher assemblies of congregational representatives can exercise considerable authority over individual congregations.|$|E
50|$|The {{philosophical}} {{formation of}} Gómez Martínez starts in Germany {{as a reaction}} to the Spanish repression (Franco’s dictatorship) and the reading in German of Ortega y Gasset. Once in the United States, it will be the influence of Américo Castro, José Gaos and Leopoldo Zea who will bring him back to Ortega y Gasset. These early influences will then permeate all his intellectual work. The first expression of his thought was a seminal study, “Américo Castro y Sánchez Albonoz” (1972), and the more in-depth examination in his book Américo Castro y el origen de los españoles (1975). Then he complemented this <b>first</b> <b>articulation</b> of his philosophy of history with a theoretical reflection about the essay as a means of communication of thought (Teoría del ensayo, 1981). However, it was through his participation in the biannual international gatherings at the University of Salamanca, that his theoretical base acquired a precise objective in the study of Latin American Thought. His published books, as well as numerous chapters in books and articles in professional journals embody this path. Within the published work of Gómez-Martínez there are three facets that seem to define his achievements: historian of ideas, theoretician, and organizer of projects for the dissemination of Hispanic Thought.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>first</b> <b>articulation</b> of a Pax Americana {{occurred}} {{after the end}} of the American Civil War with reference to the peaceful nature of the North American geographical region, and was abeyant at the commencement of the First World War. Its emergence was concurrent with the development of the idea of American exceptionalism. This view holds that the U.S. occupies a special niche among developed nations in terms of its national credo, historical evolution, political and religious institutions, and unique origins. The concept originates from Alexis de Tocqueville, who asserted that the then-50-year-old United States held a special place among nations because it was a country of immigrants and the first modern democracy. From the establishment of the United States after the American Revolution until the Spanish-American War, the foreign policy of the United States had a regional, instead of global, focus. The Pax Americana, which the Union enforced upon the states of central North America, was a factor in the United States' national prosperity. The larger states were surrounded by smaller states, but these had no anxieties: no standing armies to require taxes and hinder labor; no wars or rumors of wars that would interrupt trade; there is not only peace, but security, for the Pax Americana of the Union covered all the states within the federal constitutional republic. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first time the phrase appeared in print was in the August 1894 issue of Forum: [...] "The true cause for exultation is the universal outburst of patriotism in support of the prompt and courageous action of President Cleveland in maintaining the supremacy of law throughout the length and breadth of the land, in establishing the pax Americana." ...|$|E

5000|$|Smith {{also taught}} as a visiting {{associate}} professor at Stanford University (1961-1962) and there made contact with Sidney Siegel, who was also doing work in experimental economics. Smith moved {{with his family to}} Massachusetts and got a position first at Brown University (1967-1968) and then at the University of Massachusetts (1968-1972). Smith also received appointments at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences (1972-1973) and Caltech (1973-1975). At Caltech, Charlie Plott encouraged Smith to formalize the methodology of experimental economics, which he did in two articles. In 1976, [...] "Experimental Economics: Induced Value Theory" [...] was published in the American Economic Review (AER). It was the <b>first</b> <b>articulation</b> of the principle behind economic experiments. Six years later, these principles were expanded in [...] "Microeconomic Systems as an Experimental Science," [...] also in the AER. This paper neatly adapts the principles of a microeconomic system developed by Leonid Hurwicz, a recent winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, to the development of economic experiments. In Hurwicz's formulation, a microeconomic system consists of an economic environment, an economic institution (or economic mechanism), and an economic outcome. The economic environment is simply the preferences {{of the people in the}} economy and the production capabilities of the firms in the economy. The key insight in this formulation is that the economic outcome can be affected by the economic institution. The mechanism design provides a formal means for tests of the performance of an economic institution, and experimental economics, as developed by Smith, provided a means for formal empirical assessment of the performance of economic institutions. There is a second key contribution of his influential paper [...] "Microeconomic Systems as an Experimental Science," [...] but it goes beyond adaptation of the concepts of mechanism design developed by Hurwicz. In his paper, Smith describes the technique of induced values, the method used in controlled laboratory experiments in economics, political science, and psychology. This technique is what allows experimental economists to create a replica of a market in a laboratory. Subjects in an experiment are told that they can produce a [...] "commodity" [...] at a cost and then sell it to buyers. The seller earns the difference between the price received and its cost. Buyers are told that the commodity has a value to them when they consume it, and they earn the difference between the value of the commodity to them and its price. Using the technique, Smith and his coauthors have examined the performance of alternative trading mechanisms in resource allocation.|$|E
