In many room and pillar mines, the pillars are taken out starting at the farthest point from the stope access, allowing the roof to collapse and fill in the stope.

40|$|This {{exploratory}} {{study investigated the}} relationship between vision obstructions from <b>body</b> <b>pillars</b> and lane-change crashes. The vision obstructions were quantified by measuring, from the driver’s perspective, the horizontal angular sizes and locations of the driver-side A-, B-, and C-pillars. The sample consisted of 21 vehicle models, including 13 passenger cars, 6 SUVs, 1 minivan, and 1 pickup truck. To control for driver differences, going-straight crashes were used for comparison, with the dependent variable being the ratio of lane-change crashes to going-straight crashes. The analysis used North Carolina crash data. The results of a multiple regression indicate that the relative frequency of lanechange crashes tended to increase with both wider A-pillars and with A-pillars located farther away from straight ahead. This finding supports the hypothesis that visibility obstructions due to A-pillars have safety implications. However, a more comprehensive analysis {{would be needed to}} conclusively exclude other factors as potentially accounting for the obtained finding...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{light-weight}} {{design has}} absorbed attentions in automotive industry {{due to its}} beneficial impacts such as reducing fuel consumption and CO 2 emission and, at the same time, maintain or even improve structural efficiency and performance. Beside other materials, such as aluminum, {{which can be used}} in light-weight design, composites play an important role due to their high strength, low weight and more durability. In this paper efforts have been made to investigate the design of a roof panel with different composite material solutions paying particular attention to its response in the car frontal crash. The roof panel modeling is carried out in the explicit finite element code LS-DYNA, which is suitable for crashworthiness analysis, with three material solutions of steel (that being the normal production solution will be the reference), aluminum and composite. MAT 24 "Piecewise Linear Plasticity" is applied to model the steel and aluminum roof panels which is an elasto-plastic material model that can analyze failure based on plastic strain. MAT 54 "Enhanced Composite Damage" along with the Chang-Chang failure criterion is utilized to model the composite roof. This material model is quite common to model composite material because it reduces the number of experimental input parameters compared to damage mechanics-based material models and it can develop the progressive failure and material degradation during the crash. Roof sections are defined near the car <b>body</b> <b>pillars</b> to obtain the results in a wide range and ease to compare set of data. Results including section forces, section displacements and roof absorbed energy are computed and compared for different materials. Results reveal that the composite roof has almost similar response with aluminum and steel panels in frontal crash but is giving larger contribution to vehicle stiffnes...|$|R

This study aimed to determining body esteem components in women with PCOS. Materials and methods:  This study was done on 100 women with PCOS who were selected by consecutive sampling in Tehran, 2013. Data were collected by body esteem questionnaire and then analyzed using t student test. P < 0. 05 was considered as a statistically significant level. Results: Total mean score and standard deviation (SD) of body esteem in PCOS women was 31. 64 ± 3. 51 and mean and SD of body esteem components was 2. 57 ± 0. 55 in sexual attractiveness, 7. 54 ± 1. 50 in being comfort with body, 11. 11 ± 1. 99 in own body comparison with healthy body, and 7. 85 ± 1. 64 in own and others ideas about sexual attractiveness.
