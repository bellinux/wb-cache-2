Compared to the Black-Scholes case, a trader generally buys more stock and borrows more (shorts and lends more) to replicate a call (put). The excess replicating cost over the Black-Scholes price is significant. Furthermore, price impact implies that an out-of-money option has lower implied volatility than an <b>in-the-money</b> <b>option.</b> This finding has important implications for empirical analysis on “volatility smile. ...|$|E

Based on prospect theory and agency theory, we emphasize the legacy conservation and wealth preservation concerns of CEOs and investigate how their holdings of in-the-money unexercised options and firm equity accentuate or mitigate the career horizon problem. The model is tested {{in the context of}} international acquisitions with a sample of 293 U. S. firms over a five-year period (1995 - 1999). We find that a longer CEO career horizon is associated with a higher likelihood of international acquisitions. We also find that CEOs nearing retirement with high levels of in-the-money unexercised options and equity holdings are less likely to engage in international acquisitions than CEOs with low levels of in-the-money options and equity holdings.

The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. The proposed rule change would reiterate or modify portions of OCC’s margin rules for options on securities that are subject to a cash merger. When a corporation is acquired by cash merger, each share of stock must be converted into an amount of cash specified in the merger documents. Trading in both the security and in any option on the security ceases on or about the effective date of the merger. OCC has adopted special policies for dealing with any unexpired options on securities that {{are the subject of}} a cash merger (called “cash options”). Currently, when a cash merger occurs, OCC determines, pursuant to OCC By-Law Art.

40|$|Stochastic {{volatility}} {{models on}} option pricing have received much study {{following the discovery}} of the non-at implied surface following the crash of the stock markets in 1987. The most widely used stochastic volatility model is introduced by Heston (1993) because of its ability to generate volatility satisfying the market observations, being non-negative and mean-reverting, and also providing a closed-form solution for the European options. However, little research has been done on Heston model used to price early-exercise options. This presumably is largely due to the absence of a closed-form solution and the increase in computational requirement that complicates the required calibration exercise. This thesis examines the performance of the Heston model versus the Black-Scholes model for the American Style equity option of Microsoft and the index option of S&P 100 index. We employ a finite difference method combined with a Projected Successive Over-relaxation method for pricing an American put option under the Black-Scholes model, while an Alternating Direction Implicit method is utilized to decompose a multi-dimensional partial differential equation into several one dimensional steps under the Heston model. For the calibration of the Heston model, we apply a two step procedure where in the first step we apply an indirect inference method to historical stock prices to estimate diffusion parameters under a probability measure and then use a least squares method to estimate the instantaneous volatility and the market risk premium which are used to switch from working under the probability measure to working under the risk-neutral measure. We find that option price is positively related with the value of the mean reverting speed and the long-term variance. It is not sensitive to the market price of risk and it is negatively related with the risk free rate and the volatility of volatility. By comparing the European put option and the American put option under the Heston model, we observe that their implied volatility generally follow similar patterns. However, there are still some interesting observations that can be made from the comparison of the two put options. First, for the out-of-the-money category, the American and European options have rather comparable implied volatilities with the American options' implied volatility being slightly bigger than the European options. While for the in-the-money category, the implied volatility of the European options is notably higher than the American options and its value exceeds the implied volatility of the American options. We also assess the performance of the Heston model by comparing its result with the result from the Black-Scholes model. We observe that overall the Heston model performs better than the Black-Scholes model. In particular, the Heston model has tendency of underpricing the <b>in-the-money</b> <b>option</b> and overpricing the out-of-the-money option. Whereas, the Black-Scholes model is inclined to underprice both the <b>in-the-money</b> <b>option</b> and the out-of-the-money option. b 1 yea...|$|E

40|$|The Duan Options Pricing Model is an {{alternative}} to the Black & Scholes Model (B&S), but considers the heteroskedasticity and the non-normality of the asset-returns. This study analyzes the performance and the characteristics of this model when applied to the Brazilian market, specifically on Telebrás calls, during the period of July 1995 to June 2000. For this purpose, the prices found with the model are compared with the market prices and the ones found with the B&S model. For the construction of the Duan model, a random process is selected between GARCH(1, 1), EGARCH(1, 1) and TARCH (1, 1) in each semester. Three different ways of estimating volatility are used in the model: the implicit one of the B&S equation, the historical one, and the GARCH one. The results suggest that the differences between the prices generated by the model and by the market are less when pricing <b>in-the-money</b> <b>options,</b> when the model uses the EGARCH(1, 1) process in its construction and when the implicit volatility of B&S is used. The model highly overprices the majority of the options when it uses the GARCH (1, 1) in its construction and it underprices at-the-money and out-of-the-money options when the EGARCH (1, 1) process is used. The <b>in-the-money</b> <b>options</b> are always overpriced, independent of the process used. ...|$|R

Empirical results using Australian data show that a five-minute window for matching transactions does not remove the nonsimultaneity bias for near-the-money and out-of-the money options.

40|$|This study aims {{to examine}} whether a manager uses {{discretion}} in determining impairment loss on goodwill in the years subsequent {{to the adoption of}} International Accounting Standards (IAS) 36, based on executive incentives and corporate governance characteristics. This study was conducted on 66 New Zealand companies which were listed on the New Zealand (Stock) Exchange (NZX) from 2008 – 2010.

This study uses a dichotomous logistic regression model to predict the goodwill impairment loss (GIL) with economic performance, executive incentives and corporate governance explanatory variables. Test results reveal that managers’ reporting incentives affect their decisions to recognise goodwill impairment when the managers have sizable holdings of <b>in-the-money</b> stock <b>options.</b> Results indicate a strong, positive association between managers’ discretion to recognise the goodwill impairment loss and the strength of corporate governance characteristics, especially the percentage of outside directors’ ownership.

In a simple principal-agent framework, I {{predict that the}} CEO’s pay-performance sensitivity decreases with the executive hedging cost.

Providing further support for the theory, I show that shareholders also impose high sensitivity of CEO wealth to stock volatility via compensation contracts when managers can hedge. In addition to providing higher-power contracts, shareholders increase financial leverage to resolve the executive-hedging problem. Moreover, executives with lower hedging costs hold more exercisable <b>in-the-money</b> <b>options,</b> have weaker incentives to cut dividends, and pursue fewer corporate diversification initiatives. Overall, the ability to hedge firm risk undermines executive incentive and enables managers to bear more risk, thus affecting governance mechanisms and managerial actions.

In addition, liquidation exercises of deep <b>in-the-money</b> <b>options</b> are associated with larger income-increasing abnormal accruals, signalling lower quality earnings. On the buy side, we find that regular insider share purchases are associated with positive future earnings news while purchases through option conversions are not.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} price of S&P 500 index options by using Heston's (1993) {{stochastic}} volatility option pricing model. The Heston model is calibrated by a two-step estimation procedure to incorporate both the information from time-series asset return and the information from cross-sectional option data.

40|$|We empirically {{examine the}} impact of trading {{activities}} on the liquidity of individual equity options measured by the proportional bid-ask spread. There are three main findings. First, the option return volatility, defined as the option price elasticity times the stock return volatility, has a much higher power in explaining the spread variations than the commonly considered liquidity determinants such as the stock return volatility and option trading volume. Second, after controlling for all the liquidity determinants, we find a maturity-substitution effect due to expiration cycles. When medium-term options (60 - 90 Â days maturity) are not available, traders use short-term options as substitutes whose higher volume leads to a smaller bid-ask spread or better liquidity. Third, we also find a moneyness-substitution effect induced by the stock return volatility.
