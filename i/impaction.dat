5|$|Food <b>impaction</b> {{occurs when}} food debris, {{especially}} fibrous food such as meat, becomes trapped between two teeth and is {{pushed into the}} gums during chewing. The usual cause of food <b>impaction</b> is disruption of the normal interproximal contour or drifting of teeth so that a gap is created (an open contact). Decay can lead to collapse of part of the tooth, or a dental restoration may not accurately reproduce the contact point. Irritation, localized discomfort or mild pain {{and a feeling of}} pressure from between the two teeth results. The gingival papilla is swollen, tender and bleeds when touched. The pain occurs during and after eating, and may slowly disappear before being evoked again at the next meal, or relieved immediately by using a tooth pick or dental floss in the involved area. A gingival or periodontal abscess may develop from this situation.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{eruption}} may {{be altered}} by some environmental factors. When eruption is prematurely stopped, the tooth {{is said to}} be impacted. The most common cause of tooth <b>impaction</b> is lack of space in the mouth for the tooth. Other causes may be tumors, cysts, trauma, and thickened bone or soft tissue. Tooth ankylosis occurs when the tooth has already erupted into the mouth but the cementum or dentin has fused with the alveolar bone. This may cause a person to retain their primary tooth instead of having it replaced by a permanent one.|$|E
5|$|Even a {{slightly}} dehydrated horse is {{at higher risk}} of developing <b>impaction</b> colic. Additionally, dehydration can lead to weight loss because the horse cannot produce adequate amounts of saliva, thus decreasing the amount of feed and dry forage consumed. Thus, {{it is especially important}} for horse owners to encourage their horses to drink when there is a risk of dehydration; when horses are losing a great deal of water in hot weather due to strenuous work, or in cold weather due to horses' natural tendency to drink less when in a cold environment. To encourage drinking, owners may add electrolytes to the feed, additives to make the water especially palatable (such as apple juice), or, when it is cold, to warm the water so that it is not at a near-freezing temperature.|$|E
40|$|Magister Scientiae Dentium - MSc(Dent) It {{is common}} {{practice}} to remove impacted mandibular third molars due to pathology {{associated with these}} <b>impactions.</b> Alternatively, <b>impactions</b> can be treated conservatively through a closely guarded follow-up regiment. However, many symptoms associated with impacted third molars may be prevented by elective removal of potentially problematic teeth. To determine {{the risk of developing}} pathology associated with impacted mandibular third molars, a ransom sample of 200 pantomographs were analyzed displaying 324 <b>impactions</b> from patients who presented for treatment at the Maxillo-Facial and Oral Surgery Department, Faculty of Dentistry, University of the Western Cape.

50|$|Often {{underlying}} {{medical conditions}} cause fecal impactions; these conditions {{should be treated}} {{to reduce the risk}} of future <b>impactions.</b> Many types of medications (most notably opioid pain medications, such as codeine) reduce motility of the colon, increasing the likelihood of fecal <b>impactions.</b> If possible, alternate medications should be prescribed that avoid the side effect of constipation.|$|R
30|$|Impacted canines are a {{frequently}} encountered {{problem in}} orthodontics, and the maxillary canines are {{the second most}} frequently impacted teeth after the third molars with a prevalence rate that ranges between 1 % and 3 % [1 - 4]. Canines can be impacted labially or palatally, and in non-Hispanic white populations, palatally impacted canines are {{at least twice as}} prevalent as labially impacted canines [5, 6]. Moreover, palatal canine <b>impactions</b> are more common in females than in males with a 2 : 1 ratio [7], and their occurrence is bilateral in 19 % to 45 % of all cases [8 - 10]. While labial canine <b>impactions</b> are most often associated with the presence of maxillary crowding [6, 11], 82 % to 85 % of palatal <b>impactions</b> occur in the absence of crowding.|$|R
5|$|Grass is the guinea pig's natural diet. Their molars are {{particularly}} suited for grinding plant matter, and grow continuously throughout the animal's life. Most grass-eating mammals are quite large {{and have a}} long digestive tract; while guinea pigs have much longer colons than most rodents, they must also supplement their diet by coprophagy, the eating of their own feces. However, they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately, but produce special soft pellets, called cecotropes, which recycle B vitamins, fiber, and bacteria required for proper digestion. The cecotropes (or caecal pellets) are eaten directly from the anus, unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese. They share this behaviour with rabbits. In geriatric boars or sows (the condition is rarer in young ones), the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus for consumption can become weak. This creates a condition known as anal <b>impaction,</b> which prevents the boar from redigesting cecotropes, though harder pellets may pass through the impacted mass. The condition may be temporarily alleviated by carefully expelling the impacted feces.|$|E
25|$|Impacted wisdom {{teeth are}} often {{described}} by the direction of their <b>impaction</b> (forward tilting, or mesioangular being the most common), the depth of <b>impaction</b> {{and the age of}} the patient as well as other factors such as pre-existing infection or the presence of pathology. Of these predictors, age correlates best with extraction difficulty and complications during wisdom teeth removal rather than the orientation of the <b>impaction.</b>|$|E
25|$|Impacted wisdom {{teeth are}} {{classified}} by {{the direction and}} depth of <b>impaction,</b> the amount of available space for tooth eruption. {{and the amount of}} soft tissue or bone (or both) that covers them. The classification structure helps clinicians estimate the risks for <b>impaction,</b> infections and complications associated with wisdom teeth removal. Wisdom teeth are also classified by the presence (or absence) of symptoms and disease.|$|E

Diagnostic radio-graphs in the form of intra-oral periapicals had been on 65. 2 % of the patients. The ratio of the right to left third molar <b>impactions</b> was 8 : 11. Preoperative examination revealed that 62. 4 % of the patients had mesio angular <b>impactions.</b> Other types of <b>impactions</b> included disto-a n g u l a r, horizontal and vertical impacted <b>impactions</b> (Figure 2). 46. 4 % and 32. 9 % of patients had caries of the impacted teeth and sound symptomless impacted mandibular third molars respectively. 60. 4 % of patients received postoperative antibiotics and 85 % of these received phenoxymethyl penicillin (Pen V). The remain-ing 15 % received the following: crystalline pencillin with or without a course of Pen V (8. 2 %), other penicil-lin (3. 5 %) or tetracylines and sulphamethoxazole /trim-thoprim (Septrin) 3. 3 %.

25|$|Horses {{with a large}} colon <b>impaction</b> {{usually have}} mild signs that slowly get worse if the <b>impaction</b> does not resolve, and can produce severe signs. Diagnosis is often made by rectal {{palpation}} of the mass, although {{this is not always}} accurate since a portion of the colon is not palpable on rectal. Additional sections of intestines may be distended if there is fluid backup. Manure production decreases, and if passed, is usually firm, dry and mucus covered. Horses are treated with analgesics, fluid therapy, mineral oil, dactyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DSS), and/or epsom salts. Analgesics usually can control the abdominal discomfort, but may become less efficacious over time if the <b>impaction</b> does not resolve. Persistent impactions may require fluids administered both intravenously and orally via nasogastric tube, at a rate 2–4 times the maintenance for the animal. Feed is withheld. Horses that do not improve or become very painful, or those that have large amounts of gas distention, are recommended to undergo surgery to remove the <b>impaction</b> via enterotomy of the pelvic flexure. Approximately 95% of horses that undergo medical management, and 58% of surgical cases, survive.|$|E
25|$|Impacted wisdom teeth (or {{impacted}} third molars) are wisdom teeth {{which do}} not fully erupt into the mouth because of blockage from other teeth (<b>impaction).</b> If the wisdom teeth {{do not have an}} open connection to the mouth, pain can develop with the onset of inflammation or infection or damage to the adjacent teeth. Common accepted hypothesis that determine eruption is the angle at which the 3rd molars sit, the stage of root formation of 3rd molars at the point of screening, depth of <b>impaction,</b> how much room there is for eruption as well as the size of the 3rd molar.|$|E
25|$|Small colon <b>impactions</b> {{represent}} {{a small number}} of colics in the horse, and are usually caused by obstruction from fecaliths, enteroliths, and meconium. Horses usually present with standard colic signs (pawing, flank watching, rolling) in 82% of horses, and occasionally with diarrhea (31%), anorexia (30%), straining (12%), and depression (11%), and rectal examination will reveal firm loops of small colon or actually palpable obstruction in the rectum. <b>Impactions</b> are most common in miniature horses, possibly because they do not masticate their feed as well, and during the fall and winter. Medical management includes the aggressive use of fluids, laxatives and lubricants, and enemas, as well as analgesics and anti-inflammatories. However, these <b>impactions</b> often require surgical intervention, and the surgeon will empty the colon either by enterotomy or by lubricants and massage. Surgical intervention usually results in longer recovery time at the hospital. Prognosis is very good, and horses treated with surgical treatment had a survival with return to athletic function rate of 91%, while 89% of the medically managed horses returned to previous use.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA 60 -year-old woman {{presented}} with a dry cough without dyspnea or wheezing. Chest CT showed an image of mucoid <b>impactions,</b> which were identified as mucoid <b>impactions</b> by bronchofiberscopy. Aspergillus niger was cultured from her mucus. Her serum total IgE was 5150  IU/ml. Precipitins and IgE specific for Aspergillus were positive. She had no history of asthma and no evidence of bronchoconstriction by pulmonary function tests. Thus, a diagnosis was made of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis without asthma. She refused to take oral corticosteroids, although she improved spontaneously. However, her dry cough persisted. Her cough was relieved by administering an inhaled β- 2 agonist; therefore, cough variant asthma was diagnosed. She was treated with an inhaled corticosteroid and her cough resolved completely...|$|R

25|$|Diagnosis {{is usually}} made by rectal palpation. Treatment {{includes}} fluid therapy and analgesics, but surgery is indicated {{if there is}} severe distention of the cecum or if medical therapy does not improve the situation. Surgery includes typhlotomy, and although cecal bypass has been performed {{in the past to}} prevent reoccurrence, a recent study suggests it is not necessary. Surgery has a good prognosis, although rupture can occur during surgical manipulation. The cause of cecal impactions are not known. Cecal impassion should be differentiated from large colon <b>impaction</b> via rectal, since cecal <b>impaction</b> has a high risk of rupture even before developing severe pain. Overall prognosis is 90%, regardless of medical or surgical treatment, but rupture does occur, often with no warning.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Long-lasting food <b>impactions</b> {{requiring}} endoscopic bolus removal occur {{frequently in}} patients with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and harbor a risk for severe esophageal injuries. We evaluated whether treatment with swallowed topical corticosteroids is able {{to reduce the risk}} of occurrence of this complication. METHODS: We analyzed data from the Swiss EoE Cohort Study. Patients with yearly clinic visits, during which standardized assessment of symptoms, endoscopic, histologic, and laboratory findings was carried out, were included. RESULTS: A total of 206 patients (157 males) were analyzed. The median follow-up time was 5  years with a total of 703 visits (mean 3. 41  visits/patient). During the follow-up period, 33 patients (16 % of the cohort) experienced 42 <b>impactions</b> requiring endoscopic bolus removal. We evaluated the following factors regarding the outcome 'bolus impaction' by univariate logistic regression modeling: swallowed topical corticosteroid therapy (OR 0. 503, 95 %-CI 0. 255 - 0. 993, P =  0. 048), presence of EoE symptoms (OR 1. 150, 95 %-CI 0. 4668 - 2. 835, P =  0. 761), esophageal stricture (OR 2. 832, 95 %-CI 1. 508 - 5. 321, P =  0. 001), peak eosinophil count > 10  eosinophils/HPF (OR 0. 724, 95 %-CI 0. 324 - 1. 621, P =  0. 433), blood eosinophilia (OR 1. 532, 95 %-CI 0. 569 - 4. 118, P =  0. 398), and esophageal dilation (OR 1. 852, 95 %-CI 1. 034 - 3. 755, P =  0. 017). In the multivariate model, the following factors were significantly associated with bolus impaction: swallowed topical corticosteroid therapy (OR 0. 411, 95 %-CI 0. 203 - 0. 835, P =  0. 014) and esophageal stricture (OR 2. 666, 95 %-CI 1. 259 - 5. 645, P =  0. 01).

40|$|To {{assess the}} effect of enteral fluid therapy (EFT) in horses with colic, 78 adult horses with colon <b>impactions</b> and 30 with left dorsal colon {{displacements}} received an isotonic electrolyte solution via a nasogastric tube {{at a rate of}} 8 to 10 l every two hours until resolution of clinical signs. Clinical progression was monitored closely, and plasma biochemistry was evaluated before, during and after treatment. Volume of fluids, time to resolution, and outcome were also recorded.

25|$|Only 5% {{of large}} {{intestinal}} impactions at referral hospital are involve the cecum. Primary cecal impactions usually consist of dry feed material, with the horse slowly developing clinical signs over several days. Secondary cecal impactions may occur post-surgery, orthopedic or otherwise, and the cecum does not function properly. Horses usually show clinical signs 3–5 days post general anesthesia, including decreased appetite, decreased manure production, and {{gas in the}} cecum which can be auscultated. The cecum quickly distends due to fluid and gas accumulation, often leading to rupture within 24–48 hours if not corrected. This <b>impaction</b> may be missed since decreased manure production can be attributed secondarily to surgery, and often rupture occurs before severe signs of pain. Horses are most at risk {{for this type of}} <b>impaction</b> if surgery is greater than 1 hour in length, or if inadequate analgesia is provided postoperatively.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of <b>impaction</b> {{can be made}} clinically if enough of the wisdom tooth is visible to determine its angulation, depth, and if the patient is old enough that further eruption or uprighting is unlikely. Wisdom teeth continue to move into adulthood (20–30 years old) due to eruption and then continue some later movement owing to periodontal disease.|$|E
25|$|Large colon impactions {{typically}} {{occur at}} the pelvic flexure and right dorsal colon, two areas where the lumen of the intestine narrows. Large colon impactions are most frequently seen in horses that have recently had a sudden decrease in exercise, such as after a musculoskeletal injury. They are also associated {{in the practice of}} twice daily feeding of grain meals, which causes a short-lived but significant secretion of fluid into the lumen of the intestine, resulting in a 15% decrease in plasma volume (hypovolemia of the circulatory system) and the subsequent activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. Aldosterone secretion activates absorption of fluid from the colon, decreasing the water content of the ingesta and increasing risk of <b>impaction.</b> Amitraz has also been associated with large colon <b>impaction,</b> due to alterations in motility and retention of intestinal contents, which causes further absorption of water and dehydration of ingesta. Other possible factors include poor dental care, course roughage, dehydration, and limited exercise.|$|E
2500|$|The {{permanent}} dentition begins {{when the last}} primary tooth is lost, usually at 11 to 12 years, and lasts {{for the rest of}} a person's life or until all of the teeth are lost (edentulism). During this stage, third molars (also called [...] "wisdom teeth") are frequently extracted because of decay, pain or <b>impactions.</b> The main reasons for tooth loss are decay and periodontal disease.|$|R
25|$|<b>Impactions</b> {{completely}} covered by bone and soft tissue {{have a low}} rate of clinically significant pathology – generally small cysts or uncommon tumors that form from the residual epithelial remnants around the crowns of the teeth.
