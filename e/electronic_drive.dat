40|$|Abstract: Using {{computer}} models {{to predict the}} dynamic performance of ultraprecision machine tools can help manufacturers substantially reduce the lead time and cost of developing new machines. However the use of <b>electronic</b> <b>drives</b> on such machines is becoming widespread, the machine dynamic performance depends not only upon the mechanical structure and components but also the control system and <b>electronic</b> <b>drives.</b> Bench-top ultraprecision machine tools are highly desirable for micro manufacturing high-accuracy micro mechanical components. However the development is still at the nascent stage and hence lacks standardised guidelines. Part 2 of this two-series paper proposes an integrated approach which permits analysis and optimization of the entire machine dynamic performance at the early design stage. Based on the proposed approach the modelling and simulation process on a novel 5 -axis bench-top ultraprecision micro milling machine tool – UltraMill is presented. The modelling and simulation cover {{the dynamics of the}} machine structure, moving components, control system and the machining process, and are used to predict the entire machine performance of two typical configurations...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Electrical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2011. Reluctance {{synchronous}} Machines (RSM's) {{have become}} a viable alternative for alternating current (ac) <b>drives</b> since <b>electronic</b> <b>drives</b> have improved. These <b>electronic</b> <b>drives</b> make use of static switching devices to control the speed and torque of ac machines. The output waveforms of these devices contain numerous harmonics which can have harmful effects {{on some of the}} machine's performance parameters. Performance parameters of the RSM include torque, torque ripple, power, power factor and efficiency which are essential for the machine designer as well as the user. Poor efficiency of the RSM is mainly due to the copper losses of the stator windings and core losses in the stator iron. The core losses primarily consist of hysteresis- and eddy-current losses as well as additional losses which are due to domain wall rotation and pinning. Unlike the Induction Machine (JM), the RSM has no copper losses in the rotor, which reduces the operating temperature of the machine considerably. This thesis will focus on the influence non sinusoidal currents have on the performance parameters of a RSM. The machine will be subjected to ideal harmonics created by a six pulse drive which are theoretically predicted based on the operation of a six pulse drive. The machine will also be subjected to published data which are measured data for a more practical approach. These two cases will be compared to rated operating conditions...|$|R

50|$|An {{example of}} {{balanced}} lines is {{the connection of}} microphones to a mixer in professional systems. Classically, both dynamic and condenser microphones used transformers to provide a differential-mode signal. While transformers are still used in {{the large majority of}} modern dynamic microphones, more recent condenser microphones are more likely to use <b>electronic</b> <b>drive</b> circuitry. Each leg, irrespective of any signal, should have an identical impedance to ground. Pair cable (or a pair-derivative such as star quad) is used to maintain the balanced impedances and close twisting of the cores ensures that any interference is common to both conductors. Providing that the receiving end (usually a mixing console) does not disturb the line balance, and is able to ignore common-mode (noise) signals, and can extract differential ones, then the system will have excellent immunity to induced interference.|$|E

40|$|Component {{datasheets}} {{removed from}} digital version of thesis due to copyright restrictions. Available with hard copy of thesis in the library. This thesis presents a new prototype for a low maintenance and high quality switched reluctance <b>electronic</b> <b>drive.</b> Switched reluctance machine technology describes a modern {{brushless electric motor}} topology that {{is perhaps the most}} simple of all rotating electric machines. However, a switched reluctance machine requires power electronic switching and sophisticated digital control to be a viable competitor against alternative electronic machine topologies. Commercial switched reluctance machine systems are normally designed and built by pairing the motor and the <b>electronic</b> <b>drive</b> together. This pairing increases the difficulty and cost of quality improvement. The motivation for this research is to improve the quality within a commercial switched reluctance machine <b>electronic</b> <b>drive.</b> This particular <b>electronic</b> <b>drive</b> suffers from repeated common modes of failure. To achieve this, an accurate understanding of the interactions between functional components of the drive is crucial to reducing this complexity. This reduction in complexity can be achieved through appropriate separation of these functional components. Reverse engineering the <b>electronic</b> <b>drive</b> provides the detailed information required to design a component separated prototype solution. The complexity of the <b>electronic</b> <b>drive</b> has been reduced by separation into power and control functional components; these components are present on separate circuit boards. This has reduced the complexity of investigating each circuit in detail and for isolating the cause of failures within each circuit. This has also standardised the necessary connections required between the power and control components should one of the circuits need to be redesigned...|$|E
