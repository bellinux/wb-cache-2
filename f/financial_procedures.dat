The paper historically situates the financial veto by considering the traditional division of authorising power in public finance.

The paper finds that the financial veto runs contrary to democratic principles; a proportionality analysis is used to determine that the procedure is an unjustified limitation on those principles. The abolition of the <b>financial</b> veto <b>procedure</b> is recommended, but alternative options for reform are also briefly considered...|$|R

A regular secretary was hired and new finance and pastoral councils began a budget process, regulated the use of the parish hall and established a smoother, more transparent administration. Msgr.

50|$|There is {{evidence}} that the Reverend James Maxwell completed work on the Academy not approved by the Board of Trustees and personally guaranteed payment. On March 1, 1810, the Trustees heard the auditor's reports and found that the accounts of the Building Committee, chaired by Father Maxwell, were in a shambles. Reverend Maxwell had ordered finishing work on the Academy that had not been approved by the Board and had given his personal guarantee for payment. This was against the bylaws of the Board of Trustees and it was adopted that from that moment forward a strict enforcement of <b>financial</b> <b>procedures</b> would be observed. However, it is doubtful that Father Maxwell paid any heed to this directive. The Board's only recourse was to collect past due subscriber accounts. George Bullett, a Trustee, was appointed to collect accounts in the lead mining districts, and Elias Austin Elliott was appointed to complete a similar task in St. Louis.|$|E

[...] From 2006 to 2016, Papp served as President of Kennesaw State University (KSU), the third-largest university in the State of Georgia. [...] During Papp's tenure, the University's enrollment increased by approximately seventy-five percent, growing from 19,854 to 33,252 undergraduate and graduate students. [...] Under Papp, the University also significantly increased its research and graduate profile, adding a number of new academic programs (including eleven (11) doctoral degrees) and becoming classified as a Doctoral University with Moderate Research Activity. [...] In Fall 2015, a University employee alleged the University's director of food services was engaged in fiscal misconduct, leading to an investigation by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and USG. [...] Investigations uncovered evidence the University's business office and external foundation were not consistently following USG <b>financial</b> <b>procedures</b> and mandatory reporting of financial misconduct policy. [...] Termination of several high-ranking University employees followed. [...] The investigation also contended the University's external foundation prematurely disbursed approximately $577,000 Papp earned in deferred compensation. [...] While there was no evidence Papp approved or was aware of improprieties, on May 10, 2016, Papp announced his retirement.|$|E
