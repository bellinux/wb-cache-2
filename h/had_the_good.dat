5|$|However, {{when he ran}} for {{governor}} in 1826, Edwards <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> fortune to enter a three-way race that split the Jacksonians between state Senator Thomas Sloo and Lieutenant Governor Adolphus Hubbard. As a campaign issue, Edwards focused on Illinois' dire financial situation, blaming Sloo and Hubbard and other legislators for it. Edwards won 49.5percent of the vote to Sloo's 46percent, with the rest going to Hubbard.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{giving up}} a game-winning home run in his 1988 opening day Fenway Park debut, Smith posted his best ERA in five years. The Red Sox <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> fortune {{of being in the}} American League's Eastern division; in September, they caught the Detroit Tigers and held off every other team to clinch Smith's second and last trip to the postseason. In Game 2 of the 1988 ALCS against the Oakland Athletics, Smith gave up three singles, {{including}} Walt Weiss' game-winning RBI single, in the ninth inning of a tied game. Boston had a 0–2 series deficit going to Oakland. After Boston lost Game 3, Smith surrendered two insurance runs after entering Game 4 with the score 2–1 to complete the four-game sweep.|$|E

5|$|Parry's {{opportunity}} to study music {{came in the form}} of a temporary closure of the iron works where he was employed. Parry <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> fortune to become friendly with three fellow workers who were also musicians. During rest periods, the three often would sing. Parry listened with interest at first, later joining in. One of the men started a music sight-reading class while the iron works was closed; Parry joined this class and became a fine sight-reader. His interest in harmony made him want to study that also. One of his other co-workers agreed to take Parry as a pupil. Young Parry was unable to read or write at the time he began harmony studies. The teacher patiently blended reading lessons with principles of harmony, and Parry quickly became skilled at both; the teacher often found it hard to keep up with his pupil. During this time, Parry also learned to play the harmonium.|$|E

25|$|On 3 April, Pomone <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> {{fortune to}} meet and capture Argus after a pursuit of 108 miles that hit 12 knots an hour. Argus was only six months old and was pierced for 22 guns, though she carried 18 brass 9-pounders. In {{addition}} to Minerva, Argus had captured two brigs from Teignmouth whose masters and crews were aboard her. Argus had a crew of 90 men.|$|E
25|$|He further {{distinguished}} {{himself in}} a campaign against the Chatti, governed Dalmatia and Germania Inferior, and then was made prefect charged with distributing money to the poor of Italy.

25|$|In 1794, Lagrange was {{appointed}} professor of the École Polytechnique; and his lectures there, described by mathematicians who <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> fortune {{to be able}} to attend them, were almost perfect both in form and matter. Beginning with the merest elements, he led his hearers on until, almost unknown to themselves, they were themselves extending the bounds of the subject: above all he impressed on his pupils the advantage of always using general methods expressed in a symmetrical notation.|$|E
25|$|After Britten's {{death in}} 1976, Pears <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> fortune {{to find another}} accompanist with whom he could {{collaborate}} fruitfully. With Murray Perahia, Pears gave performances of such works as Britten's Michelangelo Sonnets and Schumann's Liederkreis to critical acclaim. He continued to perform until a stroke ended his singing career in 1980 shortly after the celebrations marking his seventieth birthday. After that he remained an active director of the Aldeburgh Festival, and taught at the Britten-Pears School which {{he and his partner}} had set up in 1972.|$|E
25|$|Raphael <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> luck to be {{born the}} son of a painter, so his career path, unlike that of Michelangelo who was the son of minor nobility, was decided without a quarrel. Some years after his father's death he worked in the Umbrian {{workshop}} of Perugino, an excellent painter and a superb technician. His first signed and dated painting, executed at the age of 21, is the Betrothal of the Virgin, which immediately reveals its origins in Perugino's Christ giving the Keys to Peter.|$|E

25|$|In June 1882 Portal <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> {{fortune to}} be {{temporarily}} {{attached to the}} consulate-general at Cairo, at a critical period {{in the history of}} British relations with Egypt. He was present at the bombardment of Alexandria, and for his services on that occasion received a medal with clasp and the Khedive's Star. He became a favourite with Sir Evelyn Baring (afterwards Lord Cromer), the British representative. On 1 April 1885 he was promoted second secretary. For some weeks in the summers of 1886 and 1887 he took charge of the residency during Lord Cromer's absence, and conducted its affairs with credit.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{influential}} painters of northern Italy was Andrea Mantegna of Padua, who <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> fortune to be in his teen years at the time in which the great Florentine sculptor Donatello was working there. Donatello created the enormous equestrian bronze, the first since the Roman Empire, of the condotiero Gattemelata, still visible on its plinth in the square outside the Basilica of Sant'Antonio. He also worked on the high altar and created a series of bronze panels in which he achieved a remarkable illusion of depth, with perspective in the architectural settings and apparent roundness of the human form all in very shallow relief.|$|E
25|$|Gustave Eiffel's {{career was}} {{facilitated}} by the Industrial Revolution. For a variety {{of economic and political}} reasons, this had been slow to make an impact in France, and Eiffel <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> fortune to be working at a time of rapid industrial development in France. Eiffel's importance as an engineer was twofold. Firstly he was ready to adopt innovative techniques first used by others, such as his use of compressed-air caissons and hollow cast-iron piers, and secondly he was a pioneer in his insistence on basing all engineering decisions on thorough calculation of the forces involved, combining this analytical approach with an insistence on a high standard of accuracy in drawing and manufacture.|$|E

25|$|During {{the spring}} and summer of 1951, I Love Lucy moved into production. Oppenheimer, Pugh, and Carroll began {{fine-tuning}} the premise of the show and writing the series' first scripts. The trio <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> graces of having a backlog of storylines from My Favorite Husband to adapt for use on television. In addition, the series' ensemble cast and crew were assembled. Desi Arnaz retained his orchestra, which was used in the series musical numbers and to score the show's background and transitional music. Arnaz's childhood friend Marco Rizo arranged the music and played the piano for the show, while Wilbur Hatch was used to conduct the orchestra. Two problems arose, however, after Philip Morris signed on to sponsor the show, that would ultimately change the fate of I Love Lucy.|$|E
25|$|Returning to Britain in 1806, Bligh {{went out}} with the fleet to the Baltic and {{was present at the}} Battle of Copenhagen. He then sailed to the Portuguese coast, where he was active landing troops and {{supporting}} the army's operations there. He was involved in the Battle of the Basque Roads in 1809, directing efforts to destroy several grounded French ships. While cruising off Belle Île in 1810 he <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> fortune to intercept a French vessel carrying the wealth of the merchants of Île de France back to France. Suddenly wealthy from the prize money and in weakening health after his long service in the tropics, Bligh retired ashore. He settled on the south coast, receiving an appointment as a Companion of the Bath, and a promotion to rear-admiral before his death in 1831.|$|E
25|$|In the US, {{the long}} curing time {{of at least}} a month for Rosendale cement made it unpopular after World War One in the {{construction}} of highways and bridges and many states and construction firms turned to the use of Portland cement. Because of the switch to Portland cement, {{by the end of the}} 1920s of the 15 Rosendale cement companies, only one had survived. But in the early 1930s it was discovered that, while Portland cement had a faster setting time it was not as durable, especially for highways, to the point that some states stopped building highways and roads with cement. Bertrain H. Wait, an engineer whose company had worked on the construction of the New York City's Catskill Aqueduct, was impressed with the durability of Rosendale cement, and came up with a blend of both Rosendale and synthetic cements which <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> attributes of both: it was highly durable and had a much faster setting time. Mr. Wait convinced the New York Commissioner of Highways to construct an experimental section of highway near New Paltz, New York, using one sack of Rosendale to six sacks of synthetic cement. It was proved a success and for decades the Rosendale-synthetic cement blend became common use in highway and bridge construction.|$|E
