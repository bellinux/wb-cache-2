50|$|The {{middle of}} the 18th century {{produced}} a slew of northern writers, who would ultimately shape the interaction between Catholic Germany that had resisted Luther's linguistic influence {{and the rest of}} the German-speaking world, which directed the path that language development would take. The South did not have any literary geniuses to combat the sudden emergence in the North and so the most influential literary minds of two generations all happened to speak Lutheran-influenced dialects.

While eating, the two overheard an argument at a neighboring table between a talent agent and an actor. According to Price and Stern, during the overheard argument, the actor said that he wanted to [...] "ad-lib" [...] an upcoming interview.

50|$|In Harstad's novel, Albert is 42 {{years old}} and still lives with his father in the same apartment. When his father {{suddenly}} dies, Albert sees {{it as an opportunity}} to <b>finally</b> <b>create</b> the life for himself that he longed for all these years he was taking care of his father. A large part of the novel is made up of a flashback to 1985-86 when Albert traveled around Europe with his friend Viktor, and by coincidence ends up in Hong Kong and later Paris, where he meets a girl and almost decides to stay for good, before ending up returning to his father in Hässelby. The novel starts as a traditional novel exploring themes such as the relationship between father and son, growing up in suburbia, friendship and politics, but throughout the novel the tone gradually gets darker and darker as more surreal elements are introduced. The novel ends as a nightmarish tale where Albert discovers that someone have been following him for over twenty years, all over the world, and that the world is coming to an end.|$|E
5000|$|After Disney's {{death on}} December 15, 1966, plans were moving {{ahead for the}} Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. Since {{there was going to}} be another Disneyland-style theme park, this time officially known as the Magic Kingdom, Imagineers felt that one of the changes that would differ between Disneyland and the Magic Kingdom should be in one of the themed lands. The Imagineers decided that since Florida was close to the real New Orleans in Louisiana, having a New Orleans Square in the Magic Kingdom was a bit superfluous. The old designs and {{concepts}} for Disney's Liberty Street at Edison Square were reviewed, revised, and what became of it was the Magic Kingdom's Liberty Square, that served as the alternative to New Orleans Square. Liberty Square also serves as the alternative location for the Magic Kingdom's version of the Haunted Mansion, which is located at New Orleans Square in Disneyland. The Imagineers also thought that, as a follow-up to [...] "Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln", they could <b>finally</b> <b>create</b> Disney's concept of [...] "One Nation Under God", and thus the creating the Hall of Presidents.|$|E
5000|$|The {{huge success}} of Trials HD made it {{possible}} for us to <b>finally</b> <b>create</b> the game of our dreams. Sebastian Aaltonen, Lead Programmer at RedLynx [...] With the game's predecessor, Trials HD, players expressed concerns with {{the rate at which the}} difficulty curve climbed. Developer RedLynx addressed this concern in Trials Evolution by placing tutorial levels in each of the game's difficulty tiers. Players are required to earn a certain number of medals before they can progress forward, ensuring that they will have the necessary skills to meet the challenge of future levels. The game engine was upgraded from the version used in Trials HD. Draw distance was increased, allowing for roughly 500 meters of visible area at any time. The game runs at a locked 60 frames per second. In Trials HD all in-game assets were loaded into system RAM at startup, but in Evolution designers chose to stream all content. This allowed for a much larger gameplay world, higher resolution textures, and more objects to be used in-game. A new visual scripting system was also implemented. This allowed both RedLynx and community to create entirely new skill games; in Trials HD the skill game code was part of the game's core. As with its predecessor, Trials Evolution uses an optimized version of the Bullet Physics Library to handle the game's physics. RedLynx's Sebastian Aaltonen stated that feedback from players and Trials HDs high sales allowed RedLynx to make the game they had aimed to create. The soundtrack was penned by Mike Reagan, who had previously worked on the God of War series. The voice work for the game was done by three Pennsylvanian voice actors: Art Webb, Rake Yohn and Brandon DiCamillo of Jackass fame.|$|E
