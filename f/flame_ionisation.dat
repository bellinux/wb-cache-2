5000|$|A {{relatively}} recent analytical tool {{that has been}} used for the separation of UCMs is comprehensive two-dimensional GC (GC×GC). This powerful technique, introduced by Liu and Phillips [...] combines two GC columns with different separation mechanisms: typically a primary column that separates compounds based on volatility coupled to a second short column that separates by polarity. The two columns are connected by a modulator, a device that traps, focuses and re-injects the peaks that elute from the first column into the second column. Each peak eluting from the first column (which may be a number of co-eluting peaks) is further separated on the second column. The second separation is rapid, allowing the introduction of subsequent fractions from the first column without mutual interference. Dallüge et al. reviewed the principles, advantages and main characteristics of this technique. One of the main advantages is the very high separation power, making the technique ideal for unravelling the composition of complex mixtures. Another important feature of GC×GC is that chemically related compounds show up as ordered structures within the chromatograms, i.e. isomers appear as distinct groups in the chromatogram {{as a result of their}} similar interaction with the second dimension column phase. [...] The use of GC×GC for the characterization of complex petrochemical mixtures has been extensively reviewed. [...] Most research into petrochemical hydrocarbons using GC×GC has utilised <b>flame</b> <b>ionisation</b> detection (FID) but mass spectrometry (MS) is necessary to obtain the structural information necessary to identify unknown compounds. Currently, only time-of-flight MS (ToF-MS) can deliver the high acquisition rates required to analyse GC×GC.|$|E
