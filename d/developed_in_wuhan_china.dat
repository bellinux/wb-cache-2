30|$|Combining SNP sets {{into larger}} arrays helps {{increase}} the number of potential users per array, which lowers cost while providing increased resolution across a diversity of germplasm. Previously, an Illumina Infinium 6  K array in rice (RICE 6 K) was <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> <b>Wuhan,</b> <b>China</b> to provide polymorphic SNPs within and between the indica and japonica subgroups for applications in background selection, mapping population genotyping, variety identification and purity tests, and bulk segregant analysis (Yu et al. 2013). With rapid genotyping turn-around times, ease of allele calling and data analysis provided by this and other 6  K SNP chips, breeders and geneticists can interact more directly and rapidly with the data and incorporate genotyping results in their programs without dependence upon bioinformatics specialists.|$|E
