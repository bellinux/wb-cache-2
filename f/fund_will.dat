5|$|In the Lillehammer {{bid for the}} 1994 Winter Olympics, the {{agreement}} between Lillehammer Municipality and the state specified that the municipality was responsible for financing all necessary sports venues. However, after the games were awarded the responsibility {{was taken over by}} Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee (LOOC) and the town's five venues were ultimately funded through state grants. To allow for post-Olympic use, a fund was created by the state, of which Lillehammer Olympiapark received 146 million Norwegian krone (NOK). Unlike the Hamar venues, which survive on their fund's yield, the Lillehammer venues have used up their capital. From 2014 the post-Olympic use <b>fund</b> <b>will</b> be depleted and alternative organization and funding is being looked into. A leading proposal is that the bobsleigh and luge track be taken over by the state, while the remaining venues be retained by the company and jointly funded by the municipality and Oppland County Municipality.|$|E
25|$|Fund {{governance}} {{refers to}} a system of checks and balances and work performed by the governing body (board) of an investment fund to ensure that the fund is operated {{in the best interests of}} the fund and its investors. The objective of fund governance is to uphold the regulatory principles commonly known as the four pillars of investor protection that are typically promulgated through the investment fund regulation applicable in the jurisdiction of the fund. These principles vary by jurisdiction and in the US, the 1940 Act generally ensure that: (i) The investment <b>fund</b> <b>will</b> be managed in accordance with the fund’s investment objectives, (ii) The assets of the investment <b>fund</b> <b>will</b> be kept safe, (iii) When investors redeem they will get their pro rata share of the investment fund’s assets, (iv) The investment <b>fund</b> <b>will</b> be managed for the benefit of the fund’s shareholders and not its service providers.|$|E

25|$|A new <b>fund</b> <b>will</b> {{supplement}} the Oil Stabilization Fund in 2011 called the National Development Fund. Based on Article 84 of the Fifth Five-year Socio Economic Development Plan (2011-2015), the National Development Fund {{was established to}} transform oil and gas revenues to productive investment for future generation. The money will increasingly be deposited in domestic banks. Accordingly, 20% of oil income is {{to be transferred to}} the National Development Fund. The new fund is to extend 50% of its financial facilities to private, cooperative and non-governmental sectors and 20% to promote foreign investment. It is foreseen that the Development <b>Fund</b> <b>will</b> reach $30 billion by March 2012.|$|E

25|$|If Risky Corp {{does indeed}} default after, say, one year, then the hedge <b>fund</b> <b>will</b> have paid $500,000 to AAA-Bank, but then {{receives}} $10million (assuming zero recovery rate, and that AAA-Bank has the liquidity {{to cover the}} loss), thereby making a profit. AAA-Bank, and its investors, will incur a $9.5million loss minus recovery unless the bank has somehow offset the position before the default.|$|E
25|$|The re-indexing {{problem of}} {{leveraged}} ETFs {{stems from the}} arithmetic effect of volatility of the underlying index. Take, for example, an index that begins at 100 and a 2X fund based on that index that also starts at 100. In a first trading period (for example, a day), the index rises 10% to 110. The 2X <b>fund</b> <b>will</b> then rise 20% to 120. The index then drops back to 100 (a drop of 9.09%), {{so that it is}} now even. The drop in the 2X <b>fund</b> <b>will</b> be 18.18% (2*9.09). But 18.18% of 120 is 21.82. This puts the value of the 2X fund at 98.18. Even though the index is unchanged after two trading periods, an investor in the 2X fund would have lost 1.82%. This decline in value can be even greater for inverse funds (leveraged funds with negative multipliers such as -1, -2, or -3). It always occurs when the change in value of the underlying index changes direction. And the decay in value increases with volatility of the underlying index.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} aspects of the GCF concerns the creation of the Fund's Private Sector Facility (PSF). Many of the developed countries represented on the GCF board advocate a PSF that appeals to capital markets, in particular the pension funds and other institutional investors that control trillions of dollars that pass through Wall Street and other financial centers. They hope that the <b>Fund</b> <b>will</b> ultimately use a broad range of financial instruments.|$|E

On 5 May 2009, First Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov said that the defence budget for 2009 will be 1.3 trillion rubles (US$39.4 billion). 322 billion rubles are allocated to purchase weapons, {{and the rest of}} the <b>fund</b> <b>will</b> be spent on construction, fuel storage and food supply.|$|E

500|$|Kagame's {{ultimate}} goal {{in international relations}} is to shift Rwanda from a country dependent on donor aid and loans towards self-sufficiency, trading with other countries on an equal footing. In a 2009 article, Kagame wrote that [...] "the primary purpose of aid should ultimately be to work itself out", and should therefore focus on self-sufficiency and building private sector development. Kagame cited an example of donor countries providing free fertilisers to farmers; he believes this to be wrong because it undercuts local fertiliser businesses, preventing them from growing and becoming competitive. In 2012, Kagame launched the Agaciro Development Fund, following proposals made at a national dialogue session in 2011. Agaciro is a solidarity fund whose goal is to provide development finance sourced within Rwanda, supplementing aid already received from overseas. The fund invites contributions from Rwandan citizens, within {{the country and in}} the diaspora, as well as private companies and [...] "friends of Rwanda".
