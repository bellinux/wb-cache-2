30|$|In January 2015, eight {{official}} units, {{including the}} Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and the National Development and Reform Commission, issued the “Notice Regarding the Launch of Building the <b>Domestic</b> <b>Services</b> Industry as a Standardized Profession” (Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security Document No. 98 [2014]), which required that “the <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> industry standardizing its <b>services,</b> and <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> personnel professionalizing, is important foundational work for ensuring {{the provision of}} <b>domestic</b> <b>services,</b> enhancing the quality of <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> and promoting the healthy development of the <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> industry”.|$|R
30|$|On July 29, 2010, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Commerce jointly {{issued the}} “Notice Regarding Issues Related to Organizing and Declaring the <b>Domestic</b> <b>Services</b> Industry and the Systemic Construction Project, etc.” which decided to launch pilot {{projects}} for constructing an urban <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> system in some cities, including the two tasks of building <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> network centres and supporting key enterprises. On September 26 of that year, the General Office of the State Council handed down “Guiding Opinions Regarding Developing the <b>Domestic</b> <b>Services</b> Industry”, {{which stated the}} principle of persisting {{with a combination of}} market operation and government guidance. It stated explicitly that <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> was a focal development industry (zhongdian fazhan yetai), and encouraged all kinds of people to seek and create employment in the <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> industry and support the expansion and bolstering of <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> enterprises. In 2012, the “Notice Regarding Issues Related to the 2012 Launch of Constructing the <b>Domestic</b> <b>Services</b> System” continued the push to launch <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> pilot projects in some cities and supported the training of <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> personnel.|$|R
30|$|From {{approximately}} 2005 onward, {{with the}} conclusion of comprehensive reform of State enterprises, the <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> industry rapidly developed in the urban areas. In Beijing, for example, there were approximately 230, 000 domestic workers in 2006, among whom 40, 000 to 50, 000 were hourly workers. In 2007, live-in domestic workers exceeded 300, 000, and in 2010 {{there were more than}} 400, 000 domestic workers. In 2010, there were nearly 3, 000 <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> enterprises with industrial and commercial registrations, roughly divided into nine main categories providing nearly 100 types of service involving home cleaning, home cooking, home-based care, home decoration and repair, etc. The People’s Republic of China (PRC) (Ministry of Commerce 2015) <b>Domestic</b> <b>Services</b> Industry Development Report states that in 2013, 18 million people were engaged in the <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> industry, with 600, 000 <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> enterprises (Ministry of Commerce 2015). In 2014, the number of people employed in the <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> industry rose to 20.34 million, an increase of 13 % over the year before. The increase was 7.2 percentage points higher than the increase in the overall tertiary (service) sector. Among these domestic workers, 58.3 % were employed in sub-scale enterprises. In 2014, <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> enterprises took in revenues totalling 240 billion Yuan, an increase of 20 %. Calculations indicate that in 2014, profits in the <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> industry totalled 17.3 billion Yuan, an increase of 11.3 %. The annual production value of China’s <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> market is expected to reach 2 trillion Yuan in 2016 or 2017 (Ministry of Commerce 2015). In 2012, according to statistics from the China Home Service Association, China had 24.77 million domestic workers, and in 2011, the <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> industry’s annual production value was nearly 836.6 billion Yuan, comprising 1.77 % of GDP (Gross Domestic Product). 1 The author estimates that at least 25 million domestic workers of various types are currently employed in China’s cities and towns.|$|R
5|$|As {{a working-class}} woman, Anning was an {{outsider}} {{to the scientific}} community. At the time in Britain women {{were not allowed to}} vote, hold public office, or attend university.

5|$|In 1923, Sargent married Eileen Laura Harding Horne (1898–1977), {{daughter}} of Frederick Horne of Drinkstone, Suffolk. Sargent's biographers differ on her background. Aldous states {{that she was}} a maid in <b>domestic</b> <b>service,</b> whereas Reid notes {{that she was a}} keen rider, with many friends in hunting circles, and that her uncle (who officiated at her wedding to Sargent) was rector of Drinkstone, Suffolk. According to Aldous, it was believed locally that Sargent had to marry Horne, having made her pregnant. By 1926, the couple had two children, a daughter Pamela who died of polio in 1944, and a son Peter. Sargent was much affected by his daughter's death, and his recording of Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius in 1945 was an expression of his grief.|$|E

5|$|The {{results of}} the 2004census {{indicates}} that only about 15per cent of foreign workers are in the skilled category, with the remainder mostly working in agriculture, cleaning and <b>domestic</b> <b>service.</b> Country of origin {{has been an important}} factor in determining foreign workers' occupational roles in Saudi Arabia. Saudi businesses have traditionally adopted an ethnically defined hierarchical organisation. For example, a recent academic study of a Danish manufacturing company's Saudi subsidiary noted that a manager had to be European, a supervisor had to be Egyptian, Filipino employees often had technical roles, and Indians, the lowest in the hierarchy, worked in production. Foreign workers' presence in Saudi Arabia tends to be transitory: only 3% remain in the country for more than six years.|$|E
5|$|While a few former bal maidens found {{alternative}} employment at local factories, and large numbers emigrated, the unemployment situation in Cornwall remained bad. As {{early as the}} 1860s, charitable schemes had begun for training former bal maidens as domestic servants, and as the textile industry of the North of England boomed a concerted {{effort was made to}} recruit Cornish women to work in the mills. Large numbers of women took up these offers; the 1891 census showed 17,757 Cornish women living in Devon (the majority working in <b>domestic</b> <b>service),</b> 10,005 in London and the surrounding suburbs of Middlesex, and 4,439 in Lancashire. In addition, the towns growing around the newly discovered mines of South Australia suffered a serious gender imbalance and made concerted efforts to recruit Cornish women.|$|E
5|$|Before 1914, Southern Rhodesia's {{police force}} was the British South Africa Police (BSAP), first raised in 1889 and reconstituted {{into a more}} {{permanent}} form in 1896. This paramilitary, mounted infantry force was theoretically also the country's standing army. Organised along military lines, it served in the First and Second Matabele Wars of the 1890s, operated on Britain's side in the Anglo-Boer War of 1899–1902 (alongside the specially-raised Rhodesia Regiment), and by 1914 comprised about 1,150 men (including officers). Reserves existed {{in the form of}} the Southern Rhodesia Volunteers, an all-white amateur force with a paper strength of 2,000 intended for mobilisation against local uprisings. Few doubted the Volunteers' enthusiasm, but they were not extensively trained or equipped; though perhaps useful in a Rhodesian bush skirmish, most observers agreed they would be no match for professional soldiers in a conventional war. In any case, the Volunteers' enlistment contracts bound them for <b>domestic</b> <b>service</b> only.|$|E

5|$|From {{an early}} age, Hobbs played cricket {{whenever}} he could. His first games were {{played in the}} streets near his house. He was educated at a primary school affiliated with his local Anglican church, St Matthew's, and moved in 1891 to York Street Boys' School, a fee-paying establishment; Hobbs later admitted to being a poor scholar but was successful at sports. He played cricket regularly for the St Matthew's choir team and the York Street school team, and during holidays helped his father at Jesus College. In his final year at York Street, to supplement the family budget, Hobbs took a job working before school hours in the <b>domestic</b> <b>service</b> of a private house. On leaving school in 1895, he worked as an errand boy until his father's connections at the university secured him a summer job as a college servant, chiefly assisting the cricket team. Aged 16, Hobbs became an apprentice gas fitter, and practised cricket on Parker's Piece, an open area of common land in Cambridge, in his spare time. He played for various local clubs but did not initially stand out as a cricketer: although better than most other Cambridge batsmen, no coaches or major teams approached him, and his batting gave little indication of the success which came later.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Biman put out {{a request}} for {{proposal}} for the acquisition of four wide-bodied aircraft to replace the DC–10s, but both the fleet renewal plans and the airline's expected privatisation were shelved by the government. A further attempt was made in 2005 to acquire new aircraft and plans were submitted {{for the purchase of}} ten new wide-bodied Airbus and Boeing aircraft at a total cost of $1billion. Boeing arranged to finance the purchase provided a guarantee was given by the Bangladesh government. After bureaucratic delays and a perceived lack of commitment from the government, Boeing lost interest and the plans were cancelled. A similar attempt to purchase medium-haul aircraft for <b>domestic</b> <b>service</b> was also postponed. In , Biman {{put out a}} tender for the dry lease of two Airbus A310-300 and two Airbus A300-600 aircraft for two years.

The airlines merged to create the SAS consortium in 1951. In the early years, SAS would rapidly purchase the newest intercontinental aircraft and gradually relegate them to European and then <b>domestic</b> <b>service.</b> The Caravelle was introduced in 1959 as SAS' first jetliner; intercontinental jet services commenced with the Douglas DC-8 the following year. The consortium created Scanair as a charter sister company in 1961. SAS Commuter was created in 1984 to operate regional airliners. The last such aircraft were retired in 2010. SAS bought its main competitors Linjeflyg of Sweden in 1993 and Braathens of Norway in 2001; the latter was merged to operate as SAS Braathens in Norway between 2004 and 2007.|$|E

5|$|The Southeastern Federation of Colored Women’s Clubs (eventually renamed as the Southeastern Association of Colored Women’s Clubs) elected Bethune as {{president}} after its first conference in 1920 at the Tuskegee Institute. They intended {{to reach out}} to Southern Women (specifically white women) for support and unity in gaining rights for black women. The women met in Memphis, Tennessee to discuss interracial problems. In many respects, all of the women agreed about what needed to be changed, until they came to the topic of suffrage. The white women at the conference tried to strike down a resolution on black suffrage. The SACWC responded by issuing a pamphlet entitled Southern Negro Women and Race Co-Operation; it delineated their demands regarding conditions in <b>domestic</b> <b>service,</b> child welfare, conditions of travel, education, lynching, the public press, and voting rights. The group went on to help register black women to vote after they were granted suffrage a few months later after passage of the constitutional amendment. Within the state, however, and in other southern states, black men and women were largely disenfranchised by discriminatory application of literacy and comprehension tests, as well as requirements to pay poll taxes, lengthy residency requirements, and the need to keep and display records.|$|E

During this period Tinne became engaged to Philip Frederick Tinne, a general practitioner whose family had a history as profitable sugar merchants and ship owners. The couple married at the Welsh Presbyterian Church in Toxteth, Liverpool on 14 July 1910 and moved into a cottage in Aigburth. They had six children, Elspeth, John, Bertha, Helen, Alexine and Philip, along with another who died in infancy, and the growing family meant that they moved into a larger property in 1923 with an extension large enough for Philip's surgery {{at the rear of the}} house.|$|E

It was finding <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> for urban families, and it was finding work in the cities for women from impoverished regions. More than 200, 000 rural women from impoverished regions have come to Beijing through Women’s Federations to work, providing caretaker services to more than 600, 000 families since 1983.4 The Women <b>Domestic</b> <b>Services</b> Centre {{plays the role of}} intermediary and bridge. It has a cooperative relationship with local women’s federations, which are responsible for finding women who need to leave their localities to work. The company and the family requiring <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> sign an introduction contract, and the domestic worker is recommended to the client family as a commercial product. The client family pays an intermediary’s fee, and if the worker is considered unsuitable, the family can send the worker back to the organization, which will make a total of three introductions. Domestic workers have an intermediary relationship with the company; they have no labour contract, health insurance, retirement benefits, workers’ compensation or other social security, and can easily be dismissed from their jobs.|$|R

Following the designated gender temperament, use of the O 2 O (online to offline) method to provide services, i.e., carrying out real-time link-up and real-time matching, has expanded the traditional scope of <b>domestic</b> <b>services.</b> This has given rise to products promoted on the pretext of “the good life” (meihao shenghuo). The Yancheng Good Life Professional House-cleaning Company refers to the professional cleaners in its domestic cleaning project as “home beautifiers”. 7 The new type of <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> company incorporates modern concepts to meet a new type of <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> demand; in fact, the market energetically creates services demand with mainly female temperament, such as cosmetics, manicures, therapeutic massage, etc. These services were all but non-existent during the planned economy era, but now have been made available, some even offered in-home. These kinds of “lazy woman can also be beautiful” and “ 58 to Home” beauty services also include all kinds of adornment.
