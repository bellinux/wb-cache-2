25|$|<b>Ixtle</b> (maguey) fiber {{is still}} worked to create {{utilitarian}} {{items such as}} knapsacks and carrying bags, which in Santa Cruz Tanaco and Tarecuato are generally undyed. In Pómaro, Ostula, el Naranjito and Cachán the same fiber is used for larger bags used to carry pitchers and cobs. <b>Ixtle</b> thread {{is also used to}} embroider leather items such as hats, bridles, reigns, cinches. In Paracho, this fiber is dyed before being worked.|$|E
25|$|Handcrafts of {{the area}} include {{ceramics}} in Huejutla, <b>ixtle</b> items, quezqumitels, cross stitch decorated garments in the region on the Hidalgo-Veracruz border, musical instruments and furniture, especially chairs made of cedar and other tropical hardwoods. In the area around Tantoyuca, Veracruz, handcrafts from a fiber called zapupe and palm is used to make hats, carrying bags and other objects.|$|E
25|$|Most {{leatherwork}} can {{be found}} in Ejutla de Crespo and Jalatlaco, whose products are exported to other countries. Notable pieces include scabbards for machetes, saddles, wallets, belts, portfolios and more. The leather is made from the skins of local animals. Leather pieces such as belts and bags {{can be found}} embroidered with <b>ixtle</b> fiber, which is extracted from maguey leaves.|$|E
25|$|Leather is {{worked into}} belts, bags, jackets, briefcases, chests, huaraches, wallets and other items, mostly utilitarian. The pieces are worked with leather from cows, pigs, {{sheep and goats}} and often include other {{materials}} such as <b>ixtle</b> thread (piteado), bone buttons and iron clasps. Towns noted for this work include Amatepec, Toluca, Coacalco, San Mateo Atenco, Mexicaltzingo, Tenango del Valle, Tejupilco, Sultepec and Villa del Carbon.|$|E
25|$|Textile {{production}} in Michoacan includes embroidery, back strap and foot-pedal loom weaving, and crochet. Weaving {{dates back to}} the pre Hispanic period, when cotton, <b>ixtle</b> and even feathers and rabbit were used to create cloth and other textiles. All weaving was done on back strap looms, and the relatively narrow cloth stitched together when wider pieces were need to items such as huipils and blankets. The Spanish brought sheep and wool was added alongside the native fibers. They also introduced the framed pedal loom, which allows the creation of wider, thicker and longer pieces. The arrival of the Spanish also introduced new designs, such as horses appearing in weavings. Textile work is still passed on from generation to generation in indigenous communities in the state and is an important source of income for these families.|$|E
25|$|Two {{other very}} {{important}} pre Hispanic handcrafts are textiles and ceramics, whose artisans {{could also be}} full-time and enjoy fairly high status. Purépecha weavers worked with white and brown cotton, {{as well as a}} rougher fiber from the maguey plant called <b>ixtle.</b> According to the Relación de Michoacán, an early colonial period document that describes Purépecha life before the Conquest, textile work was the purview of women, with skills passed down from generation to generation. The richest fabric had feathers or rabbit fur woven into the cotton, and pure white cloth was an easily traded commodity, used as a form of currency. Dyes were from natural sources such as insects and plants, and common colors included blue, black and red. Finished textile goods included shirts, caps, dresses, threads for tying headdresses and doublets worn by warriors.|$|E
25|$|Traditional {{dress for}} women {{consists}} of a skirt decorated with stripes and a cotton blouse with short sleeves and a square neckline which is embroidered in bright colors. This embroidery often has images of humans and animals done in cross-stitch or with beads. A poncho-like garment called a quezquémetl is worn over the blouse, which is usually white with a wide purple or red trim. If it is sunny, this garment is then usually folded to be worn on the head. Traditional dress for men consists of pants and a shirt in plain cotton with a white cotton belt, with a macramé fringe and bright colored embroidery. A heavier shirt in black or blue with white stripes may be worn over this along with an <b>ixtle</b> fiber bag and huarache sandals. A local type of basket which is still in use is called a tancolote, which has a frame of tree branches.|$|E
25|$|Chiapas {{is one of}} {{the states}} that {{produces}} a wide variety of handcrafts and folk art in Mexico. One reason for this is its many indigenous ethnicities who produce traditional items out of identity as well as commercial reasons. One commercial reason is the market for crafts provided by the tourism industry. Another is that most indigenous communities can no longer provide for their own needs through agriculture. The need to generate outside income has led to many indigenous women producing crafts communally, which has not only had economic benefits but also involved them in the political process as well. Unlike many other states, Chiapas has a wide variety of wood resources such as cedar and mahogany as well as plant species such as reeds, <b>ixtle</b> and palm. It also has minerals such as obsidian, amber, jade and several types of clay and animals for the production of leather, dyes from various insects used to create the colors associated with the region. Items include various types of handcrafted clothing, dishes, jars, furniture, roof tiles, toys, musical instruments, tools and more.|$|E
2500|$|Canvas Support: The {{material}} {{of the support}} is soft to the touch (almost silken: MC; something like cotton: G) but to the eye it suggested a coarse weave of palm threads called [...] "pita" [...] or the rough fiber called [...] "cotense" [...] (MC), or a hemp and linen mixture (R). It was traditionally held to be made from <b>ixtle,</b> an agave fiber.|$|E
2500|$|The term is {{also used}} to refer to the best known of the dancers of the Fiesta Grande. The Parachicos dress in a mask, a helmet or wig made of <b>ixtle,</b> a Saltillo style sarape. [...] The mask is carved of wood and {{decorated}} with lacquer to mimic a Spanish face. Originally the masks had beards, but over time they evolved and many have an almost childlike look. The <b>ixtle</b> head covering is supposed to mimic blonde hair. The dancers carry a type of maraca made of metal called chinchin to make noise along with the taping of their boot heels. These carry a guitar and/or whip (the latter used by encomenderos in the colonial period). The dancers use the whips to lightly tap children, youths, old men and even some women. These dancers appear a number of times during the days of the Fiesta Grande. These processions visit the various churches on their path, which are decorated with branches, on which are hung breads, sweets, fruits and plastic decorations.|$|E
2500|$|Handcrafts {{produced}} in the state include baskets, textiles, metal objects, pottery and items made from wood, leather and paper. Basket making is common {{in many parts of}} the state, and similar fibers are also used to create hats, decorative items and more made from various materials such as reed, willow branches and palm fronds. In Jalpan de Serra, they make various items from palm fronds such as bags, hats and mats. Fine woven hats can be found in Tequisquiapan as well as baskets made with a variety of willow. [...] Baskets are made in San Juan del Río as well as in Cadereyta with willow and with reeds. Basket making and rope are made in most areas of the state. In Ezequiel Montes, <b>ixtle</b> fiber is used to make sisal and rope. In Peñamiller henequen is used. In San Juan del Río reeds are used to make baskets. In Tolimán, furniture and more is made with willow branches. Tequisquiapan makes crafts with rattan, roots, juniper and pine branches along with <b>ixtle.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{dance of}} the Parachicos is {{performed}} during the “Great Feast” in January each year in Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas. For several weeks, these dances {{take to the streets}} each day to honor a number of Catholic saints, especially Saint Sebastian. The dancers wear carved wooden masks, with a headdress made of <b>ixtle,</b> a serape, embroidered shawl and multicolored ribbons, carrying maracas. They are led by a “patron) who carries a guitar, plays the flute and carries a whip. Drummers provide rhythm. The dance has been named an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity [...]|$|E
2500|$|Dr. Warner’s Coraline Health Corsets, as {{they were}} marketed, were made up of two pieces of cloth which were laced or clasped together. These revolutionary {{undergarments}} also featured shoulder straps and more flexible boning and lateral bust supports made of Coraline, {{a product of the}} fibers of the Mexican <b>Ixtle</b> plant. By 1876, the popularity of this new, more flexible design had grown in popularity {{so much so that the}} company moved its manufacturing operations to Bridgeport, CT, where approximately 1,200 people were employed to produce approximately 6,000 corsets daily. In 1883 Harper’s Bazaar advertised the four most popular corsets in America as Dr. Warner’s models The brothers claimed patents and trademarks on [...] "health corset" [...] and they had international manufacturing. [...] The success of the Warners’ designs had made the brothers millionaires and in 1894 they retired and turned control of the company over to De Ver’s son, D.H. and the Warner Brothers partnership was changed to a corporation.|$|E
2500|$|The Spanish at the {{beginning}} of the colonial period introduced new raw materials, new products and new techniques to diversify the products the region’s artisans produced. In the pre Hispanic period, the main fibers were cotton and <b>ixtle</b> (made from maguey leaves), and the main weaving mechanism was the backstrap loom. The Spanish introduced wool and silk, along with new dyes/colors as well as the pedal loom, which allows faster weaving and the creation of larger pieces. Today Oaxacan weavers produce rugs, handkerchiefs, carrying bags, ponchos, various articles of clothing and more. [...] These changes did not eliminate the older methods. The backstrap loom in still in use as are dyes made from local plants, animals and minerals such as cochineal, an insect which is used to create red and tishinda, a marine snail used to create purple. The Spanish also introduced glazed ceramics, the filigree method of making gold and silver jewelry and the working of new metals, especially tin and iron.|$|E
2500|$|In many of {{the more}} rural parts of the state, the making of crafts such as textiles, baskets, wood items and more can {{contribute}} significantly to household income. Textile production is widespread, but some of the best embroidery is done in Tenango de Doria, in which blouses, skirts and more are covered in designs of bright colors. Another area with noted embroidery is Acaxochitlán and nearby communities in the Sierra de Huasteca. The designs on these pieces are endemic to the area. In the Mezquital Valley, they make items with maguey fiber, often for rope, belts, bags and sandals. The weaving of cotton and wool into items such as blankets, wraps and other items is also a widespread craft. Fibers from maguey plants and palm trees are also used in the production of baskets, hats and mats. One native hat made from palm fronds is called [...] "garambullero" [...] as well as a type of rattle. Other materials worked into baskets and other items include reeds, willow branches and <b>ixtle.</b> The working of all these fibres and materials is primarily done by women.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the masks}} are shaped, they are painted and {{otherwise}} decorated. Facial features may be cut into or {{painted on the}} mask. Most masks are painted first {{with a layer of}} white with colors added. Traditionally the decorative paint was oil and enamel, but many have switched to acrylics and other commercial paints. [...] Although details such as beards, mustaches and eyebrows can be painted or sculpted on the mask, more realistic versions add <b>ixtle,</b> cotton, animal hair (such as horse or sheep) and even human hair, as well as other materials. Eyes can be imitated on the mask with the use of marbles, mica, flat or curve glass (painted behind) or glass eyes. Many tiger masks place mirrors for eyes. Teeth can be added with the use of real ones from animals or humans, as well as metal, cactus spines, corn or reeds. If the mask has a tongue, it is often of leather or tin. Horns on devil masks are commonly made from those from cows, goats or deer. Finished masks often receive further decoration with ribbons, gold accents, bells, sequins and more. Often this addition of decoration is done by the dancers themselves to personalize them, especially the addition of beards and fangs. In the town of Teloloapan, Guerrero, the local government holds a contest for the best decoration of devil masks.|$|E
50|$|Other crafts in {{the state}} include baskets in Coroneo, belts {{decorated}} with <b>ixtle</b> thread (piteado) in Manuel Doblado, <b>ixtle</b> items in Penjamo, masks for the Torito Dance in Silao, and items made from volcanic stone in Comonfort.|$|E
5000|$|Istle (also spelt <b>ixtle)</b> or tampico fiber is {{the general}} name for a hard plant fiber {{obtained}} {{from a number of}} Mexican plants, chiefly species of Agave and Yucca. Istle or <b>ixtle</b> is also used as the common name (or part of the common name) of the plants producing the fiber. <b>Ixtle</b> is also the common name of a species of bromeliad, Aechmea magdalenae, grown in southern Mexico for its silky fibers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ixtle</b> is {{a native}} fiber {{extracted}} from maguey leaves, and its particularly worked in the Mezquital Valley and other semi-arid areas. Most of this fiber is rough and used to make rope, mats, carrying bags and a head covering called an ayate. However the finest <b>ixtle</b> thread is used to make garments. In the colonial period it substituted for linen for vestments for priests. Today it is still used to make finer ayates, with women who can make the best <b>ixtle</b> goods having prestige. A similar fiber is extracted from a plant called the lechuguilla for similar purposes. In Ixmiquilpan, the cooperative Rä Dni Rä Batha. (La Flor del Valle) and Huejutla make ayates and bags.|$|E

50|$|As {{working with}} <b>ixtle</b> and hennequin require {{different}} techniques, such as separating the fibers {{from the rest}} of the plant, this work is subclassified in Mexico under the name of jarciería.|$|E
50|$|Today, many {{of these}} items may be found. The most common items include handled baskets, tortilla holders, chairs, toys (generally miniatures of animals and objects, along with dolls), flowers, spheres and bags. Another common item is the soplador, a kind of fan used to fan {{charcoal}} fires. Palm fronds are woven into intricate designs for Palm Sunday. In Veracruz, basketry techniques are used to create traps for fish flowing in rivers. <b>Ixtle</b> and hennequin are still used, most commonly {{for the creation of}} bags and nets, {{and in the case of}} <b>ixtle,</b> as a kind of embroidery thread for leather.|$|E

50|$|Various {{communities}} make {{items from}} stiff fibers. Two communities noted for their basketry are San Vicente Xiloxochitla and Santa Apolonia Tlacalco. In El Carmen Tequexquitla and San Pablo del Monte they make images from popotillo, along with objects made of palm fronds and chairs with wicker seats. Santa Anita Nopalucan makes petates from palm and <b>ixtle.</b>|$|E
50|$|Basketry {{is related}} to other {{textiles}} arts, except that the plant fibers used are stiffer, ranging from rigid, hard works made from branches or strips of wood to the nearly cloth-like pieces from leaf fibers such as <b>ixtle</b> (maguey fiber) and hennequin. Apart from <b>ixtle</b> and hennequin, the vegetation used {{can be divided into}} two types: hard or semi rigid, which include materials such as wood strips and willow branches or canes to softer materials such as palm fronds, reeds, straw and other plant stems. The latter materials create items of more flexibility than the first. The materials used in a give location vary, depending on the local vegetation, and since it mostly depends on plant fibers, it is mostly a rural occupation, being close to sources. Materials may be mixed in the making of a piece, generally to provide patterns and textures, sometimes color.|$|E
