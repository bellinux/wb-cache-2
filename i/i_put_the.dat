If I agreed with him that it did, <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> name to one of the streets requiring baptism.|$|E
25|$|The Hercules was {{a monumental}} undertaking. It {{is the largest}} {{aircraft}} ever built. It is over five stories tall with a wingspan longer than a football field. That's more than a city block. Now, <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> sweat of my life into this thing. I have my reputation all rolled up in it and I have stated several times that if it's a failure, I'll probably leave this country and never come back. And I mean it.|$|E
25|$|By 1913, twelve oil {{companies}} had located themselves in Houston, most notably Humble Oil Company, {{which is now}} ExxonMobil. Howard Hughes was born in Humble, Texas, where the oil company started. President Woodrow Wilson opened the Port of Houston in 1914, 74 years after the digging started. Service started with the Satilla, a ship that ran from Houston to New York, New York. World War <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> gasoline-combustible automobile into widespread use, causing oil to become a precious commodity. However, the war caused the amount of tonnage arriving in the Port to drop. After the war, the rice business fell flat, causing many Japanese-Americans to find other work or {{to move out of}} Texas.|$|E

He later decided that it would be Rihanna, saying, [...] "I was like, 'That's dope. That's Rihanna all day'.

500|$|Chris Young's {{streak of}} 25 {{consecutive}} road starts without a loss was broken that {{day by the}} Dodgers win. The only other pitcher in major league baseball history had gone as many as 25 straight road starts without losing — Allie Reynolds had a 25-game streak in –. [...] "I was terrible," [...] Young said. [...] "I just never found my rhythm and never found my groove. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> guys in a hole {{early in the game}} and it was just too much to overcome. I can’t imagine, having to go through that, the courage it took, the discipline, and just how successful he was. I mean, he wasn’t just successful integrating the game. He was a great baseball player. He's a Hall of Fame baseball player. He wouldn’t allow himself to fail, and that's tremendous." ...|$|E
500|$|Bacon later {{stated that}} [...] "painting {{has nothing to}} do with {{colouring}} surfaces", and in general he was not preoccupied with detailing his backgrounds: [...] "When I feel that I have to some extent formed the image, <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> background in to see how it's going to work and then I go with the image itself." [...] He told David Sylvester that he intended his [...] "hard, flat, bright ground" [...] to juxtapose with the complexity of the central images, and noted that [...] "for this work, it can work more starkly if the background is very united and clear. I think that probably is why I have used a very clear background against which the image can articulate itself". Bacon usually applied paint to the background quickly, and with [...] "great energy"; however, he thought of it as a secondary element. He used its colour to establish tone, but in his mind the real work began when he came to paint the figures.|$|E

500|$|Veteran {{video game}} cover {{illustrator}} Marc Ericksen painted the North American box art, which included Mega Man firing a pistol {{instead of his}} trademark Mega Buster. Ericksen explained, [...] "I didn't know anything about Mega Man, and [...] I said to the art director, 'What is he shooting with?' ... He said, 'Well, he must have a pistol, because I don't see a rifle.' ... I said, 'So, a pistol? Do {{you want me to}} do a pistol?' And he said, 'Yeah, let's put a pistol in there.' So I did what I was told and <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> pistol in there. Add to the fact that they only had, like, a day and a half for me to do the painting and what you wound up with was not the greatest result. But certainly a result that was not my fault. I mean, they told me to put the pistol in his hand!" ...|$|E
500|$|In 1993, Beckinsale {{landed the}} role of Hero in Kenneth Branagh's big-screen {{adaptation}} of Much Ado About Nothing. It was filmed in Tuscany, Italy, during a summer holiday from Oxford University. She attended the film's Cannes Film Festival premiere and remembered it as an overwhelming experience. [...] "Nobody even told me I could bring a friend!" [...] "I had Doc Martens boots on, and I think <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> flower from the breakfast tray in my hair." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was won over by her [...] "lovely" [...] performance while Vincent Canby of The New York Times noted that she and Robert Sean Leonard [...] "look right and behave with a certain naive sincerity, although they often seem numb with surprise at hearing the complex locutions they speak." [...] The film earned over $22million at the box office. She made three other films while at university. In 1994, she appeared as Christian Bale's love interest in Prince of Jutland, a film based on the Danish legend which inspired Shakespeare's Hamlet, and starred in the murder mystery Uncovered. In 1995, while studying in Paris, she filmed the French language [...]|$|E
500|$|Peter Lavezzoli, {{author of}} The Dawn of Indian Music in the West, has written of Harrison's first solo single: [...] "'My Sweet Lord' was {{everything}} that {{people wanted to}} hear in November 1970: shimmering harmonies, lustrous acoustic guitars, a solid Ringo Starr backbeat, and an exquisite [...] guitar solo." [...] Reviewing the single for Rolling Stone, Jon Landau called the track [...] "sensational". In an era when songs by Radha Krishna Temple and adaptations of the Christian hymns [...] "Oh Happy Day" [...] and [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] were all worldwide hits, Ben Gerson of Rolling Stone observed that the substituting of Harrison's [...] "Hare Krishna" [...] refrain for the trivial [...] "Doo-lang, doo-lang, doo-lang"s of [...] "He's So Fine" [...] was [...] "a sign of the times". John Lennon told a reporter, [...] "Every time <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> radio on, it's 'Oh my Lord' – I'm beginning to think {{there must be a}} God." [...] In his December 1970 album review for NME, Alan Smith bemoaned the apparent lack of a UK single release for [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] and noted that the song [...] "seems to owe something" [...] to [...] "He's So Fine". To Gerson, it was an [...] "obvious re-write" [...] of the Chiffons hit, and within two months US music publisher Bright Tunes had served a writ on Harrison citing unauthorised copyright infringement. In a January 1971 review for NME, Derek Johnson expressed surprise at Apple's delay in releasing the single in the UK, before declaring: [...] "In my opinion, this record – finally and irrevocably – establishes George as a talent equivalent to either Lennon or McCartney." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{his years}} in Atlanta, he became friends with David Wilcox. [...] Wilcox along with Boston-based musician, Jim Infantino, {{introduced}} Conoscenti {{to the use of}} partial capos. Conoscenti's unique style developed while [...] "trying to be percussive, trying to be fat, trying to cover the low end, trying to be melodic and rhythmic.

In On a Wing and a Prayer Campese wrote that, [...] "I had made a similar move [...] in {{the first half}}, which had worked, but on that occasion I had run the ball out myself without worrying about releasing anyone else.

2500|$|The novel {{caused an}} uproar in the {{community}} it portrayed; it {{was taken off the}} shelves of the Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookstore — New York's only gay bookstore - and Kramer was banned from the grocery store near his home on Fire Island. Reviewers found it difficult to believe that Kramer's accounts of gay relationships were accurate; both the gay and mainstream press panned the book. On the reception of the novel Kramer says, [...] "The straight world thought I was repulsive, and the gay world treated me like a traitor. People would literally turn their back when I walked by. You know what my real crime was? <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> truth in writing. That's what I do: I have told the fucking truth to everyone I have ever met."

2500|$|The {{same problem}} of {{encroachment}} {{that had led}} to the observatory falling into disuse led Chant to conclude {{that there was no}} suitable location on the university grounds for a new observatory, and he started looking for off-campus sites. While looking, he started getting quotes for a new instrument from Warner & Swasey in Cleveland, Ohio, who had provided the mount for the recently opened Dominion Observatory in Ottawa. In 1910 Chant finally found the perfect location, a [...] plot of land near what is today Bathurst Street and St. Clair Avenue. The land had originally been set aside by the city for the Isolation Hospital, but this was never constructed and it now lay empty. Chant convinced the city to become involved in the Royal Astronomical Observatory, but the outbreak of World War <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> project on hold, and in 1919 it was cancelled outright.|$|E
2500|$|The Whitlams {{recorded}} {{their third}} album, Eternal Nightcap, with Freedman and Taylor co-producing. Freedman [...] "chose musicians to fit each song, {{rather than have}} the same band through the whole album." [...] The album was recorded on an extremely limited budget of $18,000. In a later interview Freedman reflects [...] "The band became a revolving door because I had no money to pay anyone. I actually made the album, Eternal Nightcap, during that most difficult period, that was a really tough year in which to keep my focus and keep my head up, but it ended in September 1997 when <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> record out and it just started selling itself." [...] Jonathan Lewis of AllMusic described it as being [...] " [...] full of gentle, well-crafted, piano-driven pop songs." [...] Singles from the album include [...] "You Sound Like Louis Burdett" [...] (May 1997), [...] "Melbourne" [...] (January 1998) and [...] "No Aphrodisiac" [...] (February).|$|E
2500|$|Rick Rubin {{produced}} [...] "The Greatest Man That Ever Lived" [...] {{with the}} band between April 2007 and February 2008. In the liner notes of the deluxe edition of The Red Album, Cuomo stated that the song did not originally have the subtitle [...] "Variations on a Shaker Hymn", but when guitarist Brian Bell's mother came into the studio to see them, she mentioned that the melody from the song sounded similar to a Shaker hymn that the choir sang in her church. Cuomo wrote that he realised that people might notice the resemblance: [...] "I knew {{people were going to}} come at us after and say 'Hey, you guys ripped off that hymn.' So <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> credit in there off the bat." [...] As a result, the band looked up the hymn and indeed the melody was so similar to Joseph Brackett's [...] "Simple Gifts" [...] that they credited the hymn with the subtitle.|$|E
