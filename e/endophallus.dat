2500|$|Mating {{between a}} single drone {{and the queen}} lasts less than 5 seconds, and it is often {{completed}} within 1–2 seconds. Mating occurs mid-flight, and 10–40m above ground. [...] Since the queen mates with 12±7 drones, and drones die after mating, each drone must {{make the most of}} his single shot. The drone makes first contact from above the queen, his thorax above her abdomen, straddling her. [...] He then grasps her with all six legs, and everts the <b>endophallus</b> into her opened sting chamber. If the queen’s sting chamber is not fully opened, mating is unsuccessful, so some males that mount the queen do not transfer semen. Once the <b>endophallus</b> has been everted, the drone is paralyzed, flipping backwards as he ejaculates. [...] The process of ejaculation is explosive—semen is blasted through the queen’s sting chamber and into the oviduct. The process is sometimes audible to the human ear, akin to a [...] "popping" [...] sound. The ejaculation is so powerful that it ruptures the <b>endophallus,</b> disconnecting the drone from the queen. The bulb of the <b>endophallus</b> is broken off inside of the queen during mating—so drones mate only once, and die shortly after. The leftover penis remaining in the queen’s vagina {{is referred to as the}} “mating sign”. The plug will not prevent the next drone from mating with the same queen, but may prevent semen from flowing out of the vagina.|$|E

50|$|The <b>endophallus</b> and cornua {{portions}} of the genitalia of male honey bees (drones) also autotomize during copulation, and form a mating plug, which must be removed by the genitalia of subsequent drones if they are also to mate with the same queen.

5000|$|The {{courtship}} behaviour of honey bees follows through two distinct types:Apiary Vicinity Mating and Drone Assembly Mating respectively. Apiary vicinitymating usually {{takes place in}} weather that is cool and is more local to theapiary from which the queen resides. The drones are in the sameapiary too but do not mean that {{it will lead to}} inbreeding. Drones assemble ina bulb of warm air close or far from the apiary. They are alert when the queenhas flown out of the hive and will follow her route. This is followed by a sortof fast hum or buzz in the general bee population that follows an upwardtemperature gradient. The male drone mounts on the virgin queen and insertshis <b>endophallus,</b> ejaculating semen. The male honey bee will then pull away from the queen, but his <b>endophallus</b> will be ripped from his body and remain attached to the newly fertilized queen. The next male honey bee will remove the <b>endophallus</b> that was previously left by the other male honey bee and will eventually ejaculate and lose his own. The frequency of mating for the malehoney bees is seven to 10 times during a mating flight. Most of the drones diequickly immediately after mating, and their abdomen rips open since theendophallus has been removed. The few that survive are usually ejected fromtheir nests, as they have served their sole purpose by mating [...]|$|E

This then will paralyze him, and the distal part of his genitalia will break off the sting chamber will be filled with sperm.

50|$|The {{northern}} tamarisk beetle {{was first}} described from southern Russia as Galeruca carinulata Desbrochers (1870). Weise (1893) created the genus Diorhabda and erroneously placed the northern tamarisk beetle {{as a junior}} synonym of a sibling species, the Mediterranean tamarisk beetle, Diorhabda elongata (Brullé). Chen (1961) described the species in western China as a new subspecies Diorhabda elongata deserticola Chen. Yu et al. (1996) proposed the species D. deserticola. Berti and Rapilly (1973) recognized the northern tamarisk beetle as a separate species Diorhabda carinulata (Desbrochers) based on detailed morphology of the <b>endophallus</b> of the male genitalia. Tracy and Robbins (2009) confirmed the findings of Berti and Rapilly (1973), established D. e. deserticola as a junior synonym to D. carinulata, and provided illustrated taxonomic keys separating the northern tamarisk beetle from the four other sibling species of the D. elongata (Brullé) species group: Diorhabda elongata, Diorhabda carinata (Faldermann), Diorhabda sublineata (Lucas), and Diorhabda meridionalis Berti and Rapilly.

Weise created the genus Diorhabda in 1893 and proposed the color variant Diorhaba elongata var. carinata (Faldermann), and he also placed the sibling species Galeruca carinulata Desbrochers (the northern tamarisk beetle, Diorhabda carinulata) as a junior synonym of this variant. Jan Bechyné (1961) proposed the subspecies D. e. carinata listing specimens from Afghanistan. Berti and Rapilly (1973) recognized D. carinata and D. carinulata as separate species from one another, and, by implication, as separate species from D. elongata, based on detailed morphology of the <b>endophallus</b> of the male genitalia. Tracy and Robbins (2009) confirmed the 1973 findings of Berti and Rapilly, further characterized {{the male and female}} genitalia of D. carinata, and provided illustrated taxonomic keys separating the larger tamarisk beetle from the four other sibling species of the D. elongata (Brullé) species group: Diorhabda elongata, Diorhabda sublineata (Lucas), Diorhabda carinulata, and Diorhabda meridionalis Berti and Rapilly.
