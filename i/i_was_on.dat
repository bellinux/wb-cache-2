25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1807 <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> board of the ship Canton, {{belonging}} to my uncle, the late Hugh Thompson, of Baltimore, when we fell in, at sea, near the termination of a very heavy equinoctial gale, with an English brig in a sinking condition, and took off the crew. The brig was loaded with codfish, and was bound to Pole, in England, from Newfoundland. I boarded her, in command of a boat from the Canton, which was sent {{to take off the}} English crew, the brig's own boats having been all swept away, and her crew in a state of intoxication. I found onboard of her two Newfoundland pups, male and female, which I saved, and subsequently, on our landing the English crew at Norfolk, our own destination being Baltimore, I purchased these two pups of the English captain for a guinea apiece. Being bound again to sea, I gave the dog pup, which was called Sailor, to Mr. John Mercer, of West River; and the slut pup, which was called Canton, to Doctor James Stewart, of Sparrow's Point. The history which the English captain gave me of these pups was, that the owner of his brig was extensively engaged in the Newfoundland trade, and had directed his correspondent to select and send him a pair of pups of the most approved Newfoundland breed, but of different families, and that the pair I purchased of him were selected under this order. The dog was of a dingy red colour; and the slut black. They were not large; their hair was short, but very thick-coated; they had dew claws. Both attained great reputation as water-dogs. They were most sagacious in every thing, particularly so in all duties connected with duck-shooting. Governor Lloyd exchanged a Merino ram for the dog, {{at the time of the}} Merino fever, when such rams were selling for many hundred dollars, and took him over to his estate on the eastern shore of Maryland, where his progeny were well known for many years after; and may still be known there, and on the western shore, as the Sailor breed. The slut remained at Sparrows Point till her death, and her progeny were and are still well known, through Patapsco Neck, on the Gunpowder, and up the bay, amongst the duck-shooters, as unsurpassed for their purposes. I have heard both Doctor Stewart and Mr. Mercer relate most extraordinary instances of the sagacity and performance of both dog and slut, and would refer you to their friends for such particulars as I am unable, at this distance of time, to recollect with sufficient accuracy to repeat.|$|E

He [...] "always {{wanted to be a}} feature animator, and the movie felt like <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> the character animation end", describing the experience as [...] "a blast—it felt like coming home." ...|$|E

500|$|Speaking {{out about}} the August 2011 riots {{that took place in}} England, Gallagher stated, [...] "Last August <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> tour in Europe and people were asking me about the riots. All over the world, Syria and Egypt, people were rioting for freedom. And these kids in England are rioting for tracksuits. It's embarrassing." [...] Gallagher claimed that violent video games and violent {{television}} shows which children were being exposed to were partially to blame for social problems.|$|E
500|$|With a {{past as a}} musician, I {{remember}} sometimes {{feeling like}} the audience was against me while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> stage [...] Even if that wasn't noticeable in any way, I still {{felt as if they}} all disliked me, or at least, misunderstood me, deep inside. That paranoia was kind of firmly rooted inside of me—the fear of being the wrong artist in front of the wrong audience. Thus, the idea for 'She's Madonna' deals with that.|$|E

500|$|In a 2005 {{interview}} with Kerrang!, Trent Reznor expressed his intentions to write {{material for a}} new release while on tour promoting With Teeth. He reportedly began work on the new album by September 2006. Reznor devised much of the album's musical direction on his laptop. Reznor told Kerrang! in a later interview, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> the [...] tour, to keep myself busy I just really hunkered down and was working on music the whole time, so this kept me in a creative mode and when I finished the tour I felt like I wasn't tired and wanted to keep at it." ...|$|E
500|$|Wrigley {{became a}} {{familiar}} and popular {{figure for the}} thousands of Australian airmen who passed through London during the war, and was known to take off his jacket and tend bar at Codgers, the headquarters' watering hole. An EATS graduate later remarked that [...] "under Air Vice-Marshal Wrigley we got tremendous service... I was in North Africa, Italy, Sardinia, Corsica and then back in the United Kingdom. We got our mail, we got our comforts... Not only that, when some cow went and pinched 100 quid from me when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> leave in London, the next day, with a shaking hand, I was able to sign for another 100 quid and have a good time." ...|$|E
500|$|Until now, Cardinale's {{own voice}} {{had not been}} used in her Italian films, as it was {{considered}} too hoarse, and owing to [...] her French accent, insufficiently Italian. Not until 8½ was she allowed to use her own voice. Cardinale explained: [...] "When I arrived for my first movie, I couldn't speak a word. I thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> the moon. I couldn't understand {{what they were talking}} about. And I was speaking in French; in fact I was dubbed. And Federico Fellini was the first one who used my voice. I think I had a very strange voice." [...] With her portrayal of Angelica in The Leopard and her brief appearance as herself in 8½, Cardinale achieved the definitive status of a top-ranking star.|$|E

500|$|For {{several years}} after he had turned 40, Miller {{concentrated}} on composing and playing his own music. He therefore reduced his recording and club appearances, as well as one-day associations. The stimulus for this change had built gradually from Miller's first studio recording in 1981: [...] "my recording activity increased {{and by the time}} that it got into 1986–87 <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> so many records it was unbelievable until eventually it became rather overwhelming and stressful, so I had to cut back." [...] He did continue to record, often with musicians he had established relationships with: in 1996 he reunited with Williams to appear on what became the drummer's final recording, Young at Heart; further albums led by Kenny Garrett, Nelson, Reeves, and others were made in the period 1997–99.|$|E
500|$|Bright {{commented that}} Shields' {{performance}} was [...] "a little into silly land" [...] at first, but it [...] "eventually {{turned in a}} very funny performance." [...] Shields commented {{that when she was}} asked to appear on the show, she [...] "said yes basically sight unseen. I don't know where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> the list. Maybe everybody else said no." [...] The writers had difficulty devising jokes that would be funny when Van Damme said them. In order to create [...] "Van Damme-proof" [...] jokes, one writer [...] "would say them in a really horrible French accent, putting the emphasis on the wrong word". If people laughed, Van Damme was given the joke to perform. One line created in this way was Van Damme's [...] "I can crack a walnut with my butt." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{retiring}} officially {{from the}} company, Marcus {{continued to be}} closely involved as an advisor even through the final weeks of his life. He established a sideline as a retailing consultant, maintaining regular business hours in his offices at Crescent Court {{for more than a}} decade and offering advice locally to luxury car dealership Sewell Corporation and hotelier Rosewood Corporation as well as internationally to such businessmen as Mohamed Al-Fayed of Harrods. Called on to consult for Amazon.com's Jeff Bezos, the 94-year-old businessman recalled arriving in his customary expensive tailored suit to discover 300 casually dressed employees: [...] "I took off my coat, my necktie and my shirt, down to my T-shirt. And then I said, 'Okay. Let’s talk.' I couldn’t have planned it better. It broke the ice. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> stage for two hours." ...|$|E

500|$|By {{the summer}} of 2003, Lovering was feeling depressed. In a 2004 interview, he commented: [...] "I {{remember}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> {{the way to the}} bank, and I was just bummed out—everything, financially, was really a mess for me. I was involved in this relationship that was absolutely terrible. I was bottoming out. And I'm {{on the way to the}} bank and my cellphone rings. It's Joe he says, 'Guess what?'" [...] Santiago had just received a call from Thompson stating his desire to reunite the Pixies. Lovering was overjoyed at the news. He added that [...] "the saddest thing is that when I sat down to rehearse for the Pixies, I couldn't believe that I had given up something that I loved". In 2004 Lovering and the band recorded their reunion single, [...] "Bam Thwok".|$|E
500|$|In May 1977 Genesis {{released}} Spot the Pigeon, {{an extended}} play of three tracks left off Wind & Wuthering. It peaked at No. 14 on the UK singles chart. It {{was the final}} Genesis release before Hackett left the group. He had been writing more material {{on his own and}} found it increasingly difficult to contribute more of his ideas within a group context. He wished to embark on a solo career and [...] "take the risk in order to find out just how good <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> my own". News of Hackett's departure coincided with the band's double live album Seconds Out, recorded in Paris on the A Trick of the Tail and Wind & Wuthering tours and released in October 1977. It reached No. 4 in the UK and No. 47 in the US.|$|E
500|$|LeMond has {{acknowledged}} since 2010 that the increasing prevalence of doping in cycling {{contributed to his}} lack of competitiveness. Said LeMond: [...] "Something had changed in cycling. The speeds were faster and riders that I had easily out performed were now dropping me. At the time, the team <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on,</b> Team Z, {{became more and more}} demanding, more and more concerned..." [...] He stated he had been told in 1994 that he would need to blood dope in order to win again. LeMond did not focus solely on doping for his difficulties. He frankly admitted to Abt in 1999: [...] "I figure I had three months that went right for me after the hunting accident," [...] three months in which he won the two Tours and a world road race championship. [...] "The rest were just pure suffering, struggling, fatigue, always tired." ...|$|E

500|$|Massa's {{touch on}} Hamilton's car on lap two was {{labelled}} by the McLaren driver [...] "as deliberate {{as it could}} be". Massa rejected the allegation, saying [...] "I had two wheels on the gravel. I could not stop the car and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> the gravel because he pushed me into the gravel." [...] Media coverage of the incident suggested that though the contact was Massa's fault, it was unintentional. Simon Arron, writing for The Daily Telegraph, said Hamilton's accusation of deliberate contact was [...] "unworthy and unwise", adding that the contact was simply a racing incident. The gap between the drivers in the Drivers' Championship after the race stood at five points, in Hamilton's favour, with two races remaining. In the Constructors' Championship, McLaren's failure to score points, combined with Ferrari's third and seventh, moved Ferrari to a seven-point lead.|$|E
500|$|To {{commemorate the}} twenty-fifth anniversary of The Sandman, Gaiman wrote a new tale {{involving}} the battle that had exhausted Morpheus {{prior to the}} beginning of the original story. Written by Gaiman and with art by J. H. Williams III, Overture tells the previously hinted story of Dream's adventure prior to Preludes and Nocturnes, which had exhausted him so much that it made Burgess' actions capable of capturing him. The limited series had six issues. Issue #1 was released on October 30, 2013, and although it was planned to have a bi-monthly release schedule, issue 2 was delayed until March 2014, which Gaiman explained was [...] "mostly due to the giant signing tour <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> from June, and me not getting script written on the tour, with knock-on effects". Special editions were released approximately a month after the original editions, which contain interviews with the creative team, alongside rare artwork.|$|E
