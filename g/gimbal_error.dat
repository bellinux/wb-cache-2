50|$|Although it is {{possible}} to predict the drift, there will be minor variations from this basic model, accounted for by <b>gimbal</b> <b>error</b> (operating the aircraft away from the local horizontal), among others. A common source of error here is the improper setting of the latitude nut (to the opposite hemisphere for example). The table however allows one to gauge whether an indicator is behaving as expected, and as such, is compared with the realignment corrections made with reference to the magnetic compass. Transport wander is an undesirable consequence of apparent drift.|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of quaternions for the articulation {{control of the}} Galileo scan platform is presented in this paper. The purpose of selecting quaternions is to minimize onboard computation time and program size. Attention {{has been focused on}} performing inertial pointing while the spacecraft is in a dual spin configuration. Target quaternion and relative target quaternion are introduced and used to specify the target position of the scan platform for point-to-point absolute slews and mosaic relative slews, respectively. The pointing error of the platform is represented by an error quaternion which is converted into <b>gimbal</b> angular <b>errors</b> defining the attitude change. For path control, a moving target quaternion is generated; the corresponding tracking error quaternion and the related spacecraft motion compensation capability are also addressed. A sample slew case is used to demonstrate the implementation of these concepts...|$|R
40|$|The {{results are}} {{presented}} of a trade study designed to identify a synchronous satellite antenna system suitable for receiving and transmitting data from lower orbiting satellites at both S- and K sub u-bands simultaneously {{as part of the}} Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System. All related problems associated with maintaining a data link between two satellites with a K sub u-band half-power beamwidth of 0. 4 db are considered including data link maintenance techniques, beam pointing accuracies, <b>gimbal</b> and servo <b>errors,</b> solar heating, angle tracking schemes, acquisition problems and aids, tracking accuracies versus SNR, antenna feed designs, equipment designs, weight and power budgets, and detailed candidate antenna system designs...|$|R
40|$|In the dual-axis {{rotation}} {{inertial navigation}} system (INS), besides the gyro error, accelerometer error, rolling misalignment angle <b>error,</b> and the <b>gimbal</b> angle <b>error,</b> the shaft swing angle and the axis non-orthogonal angle also affect the attitude accuracy. Through {{the analysis of the}} structure, we can see that the shaft swing angle and axis non-orthogonal angle will produce coning errors which cause the fluctuation of the attitude. According to the analysis of the rotation vector, {{it can be seen that}} the coning error will generate additional drift velocity along the rotating shaft, which can reduce the navigation precision of the system. In this paper, based on the establishment of the modulation average frame, the vector projection is carried out, and then the attitude conversion matrix and the attitude error matrix mainly including the shaft swing angle and axis non-orthogonal are obtained. Because the attitude angles are given under the static condition, the shaft swing angle and the axis non-orthogonal angle are estimated by the static Kalman filter (KF). This kind of KF method has been widely recognized as the standard optimal estimation tool for estimating the parameters such as coning angles (α 1, α 2), initial phase angles (ϕ 1,ϕ 2), and the non-perpendicular angle (η). In order to carry out the system level verification, a dual axis rotation INS is designed. Through simulation and experiments, the results show that the amplitudes of the attitude angles’ variation are reduced by about 20 %– 30 % when the shaft rotates. The attitude error equation is reasonably simplified and the calibration method is accurate enough. The attitude accuracy is further improved...|$|R
40|$|Cave {{surveying}} currently {{relies on}} visually reading a compass and clinometer. The price of magnetometers and solid-state inclinometers is falling rapidly; thus an electronic compass/clinometer with automatic data-logging is now feasible at an affordable price. However, {{the interpretation of}} the readings needs to be done with care because if the instruments are not <b>gimballed</b> then small <b>errors</b> in " pitch" and "roll" can have noticeable affects on the accuracy, with a 1 degree error in elevation and roll giving rise to a bearing error of over 3 degrees in some cases. Surprisingly, perhaps, more than three axes of measurement are required to compensate for this, and for other sources of error - four axes are essential, and five or six are an advantage. The 3 -D processing of this information is straight forward to implement, but difficult to derive. This paper gives formulas for the processing of multi-axis information, and explains the derivation using 3 x 3 rotation matrices. This paper was first presented at the BCRA Science Symposium in February 1996...|$|R
