25|$|While {{there were}} likely some plantings of Cabernet Sauvignon in the 19th century, Hunter Valley Cabernet seemed to vanish {{at the turn}} of the 20th century and didn't regain a footing in the Hunter until Max Lake reintroduced the variety along with the other Bordeaux varietals of Petite Verdot and Malbec in 1963. Today, Hunter Valley Cabernet {{exhibits}} more the regional traits of a Hunter Shiraz than it <b>does</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> varietal expression of Cabernet exhibited in Bordeaux and California. It tends to be very earthy and is usually cross blended with wine from regions outside the Hunter.|$|E

25|$|Avatars {{are also}} {{observed}} in Shaktism, the sect {{dedicated to the}} worship of the Goddess (Devi), {{but they do not}} have universal acceptance in the sect. The Devi Bhagavata Purana describes the descent of Devi avatars to punish the wicked and defend the righteous – much as the Bhagavata Purana <b>does</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> avatars of Vishnu. Like Vishnu, his consort Lakshmi incarnates as Sita and Radha– the consorts of Rama and Krishna avatars. Nilakantha, an 18th-century commentator on the Devi Bhagavata Purana– which includes the Devi Gita– says that various avatars of the Goddess includes Shakambhari and even the masculine Krishna and Rama– generally thought to be Vishnu's avatars. Lakshmi and Saraswati are also goddesses worshipped as Devi avatars.|$|E

25|$|In {{suspension}} bridges, large main cables (normally two) hang {{between the}} towers and are anchored {{at each end}} to the ground. This {{can be difficult to}} implement when ground conditions are poor. The main cables, which are free to move on bearings in the towers, bear the load of the bridge deck. Before the deck is installed, the cables are under tension from their own weight. Along the main cables smaller cables or rods connect to the bridge deck, which is lifted in sections. As this is done, the tension in the cables increases, as it <b>does</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> live load of traffic crossing the bridge. The tension on the main cables is transferred to the ground at the anchorages and by downwards tug on the towers.|$|E
25|$|The {{population}} of the town in 2001 was 85,029, by 2009 the estimated population was 86,900. Hastings suffers at a disadvantage insofar as growth is concerned because of its restricted situation, lying as it <b>does</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty to the north. Redevelopment of the area is partly hampered by the split administration of the combined Hastings and Bexhill economic region between Hastings and Rother district councils. There is little space for further large-scale housing and employment growth within the designated boundaries of Hastings, and development on the outskirts is resisted by Rother council whose administrative area surrounds Hastings. Rother has a policy of urban expansion in the area immediately north of Bexhill, but this requires infrastructure improvements by central Governments which have been under discussion for decades. This situation has now become the subject of parliamentary consideration.|$|E
500|$|Within the poem, {{the narrator}} expresses his hope that his child, Hartley Coleridge, will {{experience}} a life connected to nature {{as represented by}} features typical of the Lake District, which Coleridge in common with other Lake Poets revered. This is similar to what Coleridge's friend William Wordsworth <b>does</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> narrator of Tintern Abbey, a poem composed later that year. Many of {{the feelings of the}} narrator for his child are connected to Coleridge's sonnet [...] "To a Friend Who Asked, How I Felt When the Nurse Presented My Infant to Me". The ideas about nature in This Lime-Tree Bower are transformed into the basis for an education, and Hartley is to learn through nature in an innocent way. Unlike Wordsworth's nature, Coleridge's has a Christian presence and nature is a physical presence of God's word. Coleridge's understanding of God is Neoplatonic and emphasizes a need to experience the divine knowledge.|$|E

Along with the show's other writers, Rogen received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination. He became familiar to audiences as one of the main character's co-workers in Apatow's well-reviewed buddy comedy directorial debut feature The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005). Rogen also co-produced it and improvised all his dialogue. [...] " [...] hadn't done any screen work that indicated he could carry as memorable and convincing a performance as he <b>does</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> character Cal," [...] MTV's John Constantine wrote. The Boston Globe reviewer Wesley Morris wrote that Rogen, along with co-stars Rudd and Romany Malco, were each hilarious in their own right and Orlando Sentinel Roger Moore believed that Rogen had his moments in the film whereas Moira Macdonald of the Seattle Times said the actor was [...] "droopily deadpan." [...] He followed this with a small role in You, Me and Dupree (2006), a critically panned comedy featuring Matt Dillon, Kate Hudson and Owen Wilson.|$|E
500|$|Developer Ryan Lambourn {{created a}} flash game called V-Tech Rampage in 2007, which allows players {{to control the}} actions of gunman Seung-Hui Cho in the Virginia Tech massacre.

And that's why I feel sympathy for Cho Seung-Hui. He had to go that far," [...] Lambourn stated. On the V-Tech Rampage site, Lambourn posted a statement that he would take the game off of Newgrounds if donations reached $1000; at $2000 in donations he would take the game down from the main site and for another $1000 he would apologize for creating it. Ledonne posted a comment on Lambourn's website after V-Tech Rampage drew comparisons to Super Columbine Massacre, calling Lambourn's statement tantamount to a [...] "hostage note", and asking bloggers to consider [...] "not whether a game about the Virginia Tech shooting SHOULD be made but how we might go about making a game that accomplishes more than V-Tech Rampage <b>does</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> subject matter."
