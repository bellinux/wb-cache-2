This article presents new, single-pass incremental <b>force</b> <b>updates</b> algorithms to efficiently simulate a system using ARMD. We assessed different algorithms for speedup measurements and implemented them in the LAMMPS MD package. We validated the single-pass incremental <b>force</b> <b>update</b> algorithm on four different benchmarks using diverse pair potentials. The proposed algorithm allows us to perform simulation of a system faster than traditional MD in both NVE and NVT ensembles. Moreover, ARMD using the new single-pass algorithm speeds up the convergence of observables in wall-clock time...|$|R

40|$|The high <b>force</b> <b>update</b> rate is a {{key factor}} for {{achieving}} high performance of haptic rendering, which imposes a stringent real-time requirement upon the execution environment of the haptic system. To fulfil this requirement, haptic systems are often limited to simplified virtual environments (VEs) for reducing computational load. This paper presents a novel pipelined threading architecture, which uses several threads running consecutively for implementing haptic rendering algorithms. With the proposed method, the haptic <b>forces</b> <b>updating</b> rate is effectively increased, which leads to improved system performance and makes complex VE scenes possible in haptic rendering. Based on the 3 -DOF Delta haptic device, experiments with a virtual wall haptic system are carried out and verify the proposed method...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} six-degree-of-freedom haptic {{rendering}} algorithm using localized contact computations.

Once the objects are intersecting, the penetration depth (PD) is estimated in the contact neighborhood between each pair of decomposed convex pieces, using a new incremental method based on local optimization. Given the computed PD values, multiple contacts near a local region are clustered together to further speed up contact force determination. We have implemented these algorithms and applied them to complex contact scenarios consisting of multiple contacts...|$|R

This note presents the implementation and first results of the Laplace-filter enhanced fitting into the interac-tive SenSitus program, which supports the docking by virtual reality (VR) techniques (3 D-stereoscopic view and haptic rendering). This implementation has to consider the special needs of the interactive rendering strategy.

40|$|The force-update-rate {{requirements}} of transparent rendering of vir-tual environments are {{in conflict with}} the computational cost re-quired for computing complex interactions between deforming ob-jects. In this paper we introduce a novel method for satisfying high <b>force</b> <b>update</b> rates with deformable objects, yet retaining the visual quality of complex deformations and interactions. The objects that are haptically manipulated may have many de-grees of freedom, but haptic interaction is often implemented in practice through low-dimensional force-feedback devices. We ex-ploit the low-dimensional domain of the interaction for devising a novel linear approximation of interaction forces that can be ef-ficiently evaluated at force-update rates. Moreover, our linearized force model is time-implicit, which implies that it accounts for con-tact constraints and the internal dynamics of deforming objects. In this paper we show examples of haptic interaction in complex sit-uations such as large deformations, collision between deformable objects (with friction), or even self-collision...|$|R

Proteus allows users to shorten the execution time of their DSM programs by dynamically adding nodes to the system.

To make the system efficiently adapting to node configuration, Proteus uses several techniques, which include the adaptive workload redistribution, the affinity page movement, and the <b>forced</b> <b>update.</b> The consistency models supported by Proteus are both sequential consistency and release consistency.

40|$|We {{present a}} new method for the 3 D model-based {{tracking}} of human body parts. To mitigate the difficulties arising due to occlusion among body parts, we employ multiple calibrated cameras in a mutually orthogonal configuration.

In particular, at every frame, each camera tracks a number of parts depending on the visibility of these parts and the observability of their predicted motion from the specific camera. To relate points on the occluding contours of the parts to points on their models we apply concepts from projective geometry. Then, within the physics-based framework we compute the generalized forces applied from the parts' occluding contours to model points of the body parts.

40|$|Abstract. Massively {{deploying}} RFID systems, {{while preserving}} peo-ple’s privacy and data integrity, {{is a major}} security challenge of the coming years. This is why research related to privacy-preserving authen-tication is growing, including design of schemes, cryptanalysis and secu-rity models. In nearly all such schemes secret key cryptography is used, since RFID tags are extremely constrained in time and space, and un-traceability is achieved by updating some data at each authentication. Unfortunately, none of them entirely resists to denial of service attacks, those in which the enemy <b>forces</b> <b>updating</b> of the tag and/or the reader by sending fake messages. Moreover, literature lacks a clear and formal way of comparing schemes w. r. t. this kind of attack. In this paper, we introduce a new characterization, called synchronizability.
