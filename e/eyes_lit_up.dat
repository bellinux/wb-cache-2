2500|$|Fashion {{designers}} Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Cardin considered Plisetskaya one {{of their}} inspirations, with Cardin alone having traveled to Moscow over 30 times just to see Plisetskaya perform. She credits Cardin's costume designs for the success and recognition she received for her ballets of Anna Karenina, The Seagull, and Lady with the Dog. She recalls his reaction when she initially suggested he design one of her costumes: [...] "Cardin's <b>eyes</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> like batteries. As if an electrical current passed through them." [...] Within a week he had created a design for Anna Karenina, and {{over the course of}} her career he created ten different costumes for just Karenina.|$|E
60|$|Grahame devoured every word. His <b>eyes</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> with excitement.|$|E
60|$|For {{the first}} time since Helen had known her Rachel's <b>eyes</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> brightly.|$|E
60|$|Then {{he showed}} Lothair another, and another, and another. At last he held before him one {{which was really}} by Raffaelle, and by which Lothair was evidently much moved. His <b>eye</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up,</b> a blush suffused his pale cheek, he took the drawing himself, and held it before his gaze with a {{trembling}} hand.|$|R
60|$|Ciccio became {{excited as}} they neared Modane, the {{frontier}} station. His <b>eye</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> again, he pulled himself together for the entrance into Italy. Slowly the train rolled in to the dismal station. And then a confusion indescribable, of porters and masses of luggage, the unspeakable crush and crowd at the customs barriers, the more intense crowd through the passport office, all like a madness.|$|R
60|$|Gerald, very pale, was {{watching}} her closely. His <b>eyes</b> were <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> with intent lights, absorbed and gleaming. She turned suddenly on him.|$|R
60|$|She was {{thoughtful}} {{for a few}} moments, and her <b>eyes</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> with reminiscent humor.|$|E
60|$|He {{handed the}} thing to his secretary. Rupert Baxter's <b>eyes</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> with sudden enthusiasm. He gasped.|$|E
60|$|Dominey felt {{a strange}} pang of distress. She saw the unusual {{softening}} in his face, and her <b>eyes</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
60|$|The girl's great brown <b>eyes</b> were <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> with a flash {{that was}} at once final desperation and the {{loosening}} of some private and passionate reserve.|$|R
50|$|Countless {{welcoming}} good mountains {{along the}} river,My <b>eyes</b> are <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> {{as soon as}} I'm out of Hangzhou,Misty river banks with mixed sky and green,A sail in the glass.|$|R
60|$|The {{man seemed}} to swell {{with a sudden}} emotion. His <b>eye</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up,</b> and he thrust one hand into the breast of his coat while he raised {{the other in a}} {{sweeping}} gesture. For an instant he appeared {{on the verge of a}} flood of eloquence. And then, as if he had been made sharply aware of what it was that he intended to do, he suddenly sagged. The gleam died out of his eyes. He lowered his hand.|$|R
60|$|When {{the idea}} of sailing on the Pacific once more was {{broached}} to Billy Dill, his <b>eyes</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> with pleasure.|$|E
60|$|At {{the mention}} of fifty dollars Josiah Crabtree's <b>eyes</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up.</b> Evidently {{he had not seen}} that amount of money for some time.|$|E
60|$|The girl started, turned round, her <b>eyes</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> with {{an almost}} painful flash of a smile, the colour came deeply in her cheeks.|$|E
60|$|The {{girl looked}} at Gerald with steady, calm curiosity. He laughed, hearing himself described. He felt proud too, full of male strength. His blue, keen <b>eyes</b> were <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> with laughter, his ruddy face, with its sharp fair hair, {{was full of}} satisfaction, and glowing with life. He piqued her.|$|R
60|$|His dark <b>eyes</b> were <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> with {{a sudden}} fire and a deep flush stained his cheeks. For the first time I seemed to see the man in him {{as well as the}} priest, and I saw that he was handsome. It did not {{interest}} me; I noticed it only as an incident.|$|R
60|$|Frank went in, {{and listened}} to her prayer. Her face was as pale and calm as the pale, calm faces of the two {{worn-out}} babes, whose heads lay on the pillow close to hers: but her <b>eyes</b> were <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> with an intense glory, which seemed to fill the room with love and light.|$|R
6000|$|... "Believe me, {{there will}} be some celebration to-night!" [...] vouchsafed Songbird, as his <b>eyes</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> in expectation. [...] "Bonfires, speeches, parades, and all that." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{took his}} hand, glanced at it, and his dull <b>eyes</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> for a moment. The gamblers {{observed}} it, and showed their gratification by hardly perceptible signs.|$|E
6000|$|... "Marry me!" [...] said Wally, {{reaching}} {{across the}} table and putting his hand on hers. The light in his <b>eyes</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> his homely face like a lantern.|$|E
6000|$|... "The last boy-friend I {{had used}} to quarrel furiously with me {{at least once a}} week," [...] said Cicely reflectively; [...] "but then he had dark slumberous <b>eyes</b> that <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> magnificently when he was angry, so {{it would have been a}} sheer waste of God's good gifts not to have sent him into a passion now and then." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} Gerald, and saw how his blue <b>eyes</b> were <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> {{with a little}} flame of curious desire. He saw too how good-looking he was. Gerald was attractive, his blood seemed fluid and electric. His blue eyes burned with a keen, yet cold light, {{there was a certain}} beauty, a {{beautiful}} passivity in all his body, his moulding.|$|R
5000|$|Emily {{was looking}} for a {{producer}} so I’d realised her potential and said I’d be interested in helping out. Emily’s <b>eyes</b> kinda <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> and it went from there. And it was a great experience as I’d never produced anyone before. So I learnt a lot, especially with Pro Tools. And we actually mixed Emily’s album in my lounge room after we’d laid down some good bass and drum tracks at Doug Roberts’ studio. Monique Brumby, July 2009, Rip it Up ...|$|R
6000|$|For {{a moment}} Mr. Peters looked without {{comprehension}} at what Ashe was holding out; then his whole demeanor altered. His <b>eyes</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up.</b> He uttered a howl of pure rapture: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{can count}} me in, too!" [...] added Shadow. [...] "I'd like first-rate to see {{myself on the}} screen in a moving-picture show," [...] and his <b>eyes</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> in anticipation.|$|E
6000|$|The forester's <b>eyes</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up.</b> [...] "But {{are they}} State forests and State game? What makes them so? They are lands which the whole people {{purchased}} {{and which the}} whole people defended." ...|$|E
60|$|The Duke's {{companion}} nodded silently. He had {{the air of}} {{a silent}} man. He was short, inclined to be stout, and his dress and bearing were almost bourgeois. His features were large and not particularly intelligent, his cheeks were puffy, and his gray beard ill-humored. He had the double neck of the Frenchman of the lower class who has not denied himself the joys of the cuisine, and his appearance would have been hopelessly commonplace but for the deep-set brilliant black <b>eyes</b> which <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> his whole face and gave it an aspect of power.|$|R
60|$|Marguerite was passionately fond of music. ORPHEUS charmed her to-night. The very joy {{of living}} was writ plainly upon the sweet young face, it sparkled {{out of the}} merry blue <b>eyes</b> and <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> the smile that lurked around the lips. She was after all but five-and-twenty, in the hey day of youth, the darling of a {{brilliant}} throng, adored, FETED, petted, cherished. Two days ago the DAY DREAM had returned from Calais, bringing her news that her idolised brother had safely landed, that he thought of her, and would be prudent for her sake.|$|R
60|$|Marshal Keith {{was a tall}} man, with a face {{thoughtful}} in repose, {{but having}} a pleasant smile, and an <b>eye</b> that <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> with quiet humour when he spoke. He enjoyed the king's confidence to the fullest extent, and was regarded by him {{not only as a}} general in whose sagacity and skill he could entirely rely, but as one on whose opinion he could trust upon all political questions. He was his favourite companion when, as happened not unfrequently, he donned a disguise and went about the town, listening to the talk of the citizens and learning their opinions upon public affairs.|$|R
6000|$|Randy's <b>eyes</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> instantly, and {{he caught}} his big brother by the shoulder. [...] "Good for you, Earl; I {{knew you would}} say yes!" [...] he cried. [...] "Why, we can {{telegraph}} from Spruceville, can't we?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, story books!" [...] And Phil Franklin's <b>eyes</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> with pleasure. [...] "I love to read. Are {{you sure}} you can spare them?" [...] And when they said they could he continued: [...] "That suits me immensely." ...|$|E
60|$|Francie's <b>eyes</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> greedily, and {{he looked}} at his two silver shillings, and took two steps in the {{direction}} of the sword-swallower's, and faltered and could not make up his agitated mind. Tommy set off toward the square at a brisk walk.|$|E
60|$|This same evening {{his mother}} and sister arrived. The Countess of Windsor was by nature full of {{energetic}} feeling; but she had very seldom in her life permitted the concentrated emotions of her heart to shew themselves on her features. The studied immovability of her countenance; her slow, equable manner, and soft but unmelodious voice, were a mask, hiding her fiery passions, and the impatience of her disposition. She did {{not in the least}} resemble either of her children; her black and sparkling <b>eye,</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> by pride, was totally unlike the blue lustre, and frank, benignant expression of either Adrian or Idris. There was something grand and majestic in her motions, but nothing persuasive, nothing amiable. Tall, thin, and strait, her face still handsome, her raven hair hardly tinged with grey, her forehead arched and beautiful, had not the eye-brows been somewhat scattered--it was impossible not to be struck by her, almost to fear her. Idris appeared to be the only being who could resist her mother, notwithstanding the extreme mildness of her character. But there was a fearlessness and frankness about her, which said that she would not encroach on another's liberty, but held her own sacred and unassailable.|$|R
50|$|Where {{an issue}} {{concerned}} chiefly himself, {{a sense of}} futility seemed often to invade him: he became half-hearted, non-resistant, sometimes pacifistically resigned. He needed a cause to bring out his best; in a cause, his <b>eye</b> <b>lit</b> <b>up,</b> the steel in him flashed, and he rejoiced in the cleanness of combat. All his life he was a hero-worshipper: and he threw into the worship a quality of heroism of his own,as well as endless devotion. There flowed in him in these qualities much of his ancestral Quakerism, of which even external mannerisms persisted as symbols long after {{he had given up}} its formal tenets. Essentially he remained a Quaker to the end—idealist, devotee of the simple in humanity and the direct in relations, martyr if necessary. His habits were consistent. He was personally frugal to abstemiousness, fond of the homespun in speech and manner, distrustful of all incitements from the outer world, little susceptible to the esthetic forms of emotion, but sensitively responsive to the emotions of living beings. Often almost shy in casual company or official relation, he was frankness itself in the contact of man to man, and then not only at ease but overflowing with playfulness and quite unusual charm. His wit was pungent to bitingness; his fundamental humility unwavering and unabashed; his friendships were loyalties.|$|R
60|$|Old Mrs Merryboy, the mother, {{must have}} been a merry girl in her youth; for, even though at the age of eighty and {{partially}} deaf, she was extremely fond of a joke, practical or otherwise, and had her face so seamed with the lines of appreciative humour, and her nutcracker mouth so set in a smile of amiable fun, and her coal-black <b>eyes</b> so <b>lit</b> <b>up</b> with the fires of unutterable wit, that a mere glance at her stirred up your sources of comicality to their depths, while a steady gaze usually resulted in a laugh, in which she was sure to join with an apparent belief that, whatever the joke might be, it was uncommonly good. She did not speak much. Her looks and smiles rendered speech almost unnecessary. Her figure was unusually diminutive.|$|R
