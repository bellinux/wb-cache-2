25|$|There {{has been}} three {{attempts}} of reformation since the band's breakup in 2004. In 2006 Norton and Dedman started demoing new tracks with Matt “Skitz” Sanders from Damaged on drums, Seanheist had injured {{his knee and}} ankle {{and was unable to}} commit to recording at this time. Three new songs were recorded but were never fully finished and were soon shelved. The second attempt at reformation was in 2008 with the lineup of Biro, Norton, Seanheist and Dedman rehearsing some old songs and jamming new material a handful of times. Personality clashes, old grievances and <b>just</b> <b>bad</b> timing just made the reformation impossible to go ahead. In 2012 All five members of the band from the IRCR line-up finally caught up and met at the album's 10 year Anniversary party at Norton’s bar (Whole Lotta Love) in Melbourne, talks of reforming were once again on the table, but nothing eventuated.|$|E

Despite this, Sorkin sent Fey flowers after NBC announced it would pick up both series, and wished her luck with 30 Rock. Fey said, [...] "it's <b>just</b> <b>bad</b> luck for me that in my first attempt at prime time I'm going up against the most powerful writer on television. I was joking that this would be the best pilot ever aired on Trio. And then Trio got canceled." [...] Fey wound up [...] "beating" [...] Sorkin when Studio 60 was canceled after one season and 30 Rock was renewed for a second. Though 30 Rocks first-season ratings proved lackluster and were lower than those of Studio 60, Studio 60 was more expensive to produce.|$|E
500|$|The {{winner of}} eight {{consecutive}} Gold Gloves, Molina {{has been widely}} praised for his preparation, defense and leadership, not just of the pitching staff, {{but also of the}} entire team. [...] Fellow catchers Jorge Posada and Brian McCann stated in 2009 that Molina was [...] "the best defensive catcher in baseball;" [...] Víctor Martínez also called him [...] "the best behind the plate." [...] In 2013, a scout pronounced Molina the [...] "one piece the St. Louis Cardinals cannot lose" [...] while another commented that he is [...] "irreplaceable." [...] When the club did lose Molina midway through the 2014 season to a thumb injury, ESPN's Keith Law tweeted, [...] "Yadier Molina missing two-plus months would be bad for the Cardinals, but also <b>just</b> <b>bad</b> for baseball, period." [...] In his time in the major leagues, Molina has been widely viewed as evolving into a competitive influence and an unofficial, on-field coach.|$|E

500|$|Reality Killed the Video Star {{received}} a varied response from music critics. One review aggregater, Metacritic, gave it an average score of 64/100 {{based on its}} sample of 17 reviews. John Bush from AllMusic gave the album two stars out of five. He praised songs like [...] "Bodies" [...] and [...] "Morning Sun" [...] but felt that many songs [...] "sound rushed and the performances lackluster". He concluded that the album is [...] "not decidedly worse than 2002's Escapology, it's <b>just</b> <b>bad</b> in a different way. Whereas Escapology found Robbie disappearing into his own neuroses, {{this one is a}} hopeless mélange of satire and sincerity where, from song to song, neither can immediately be distinguished." [...] Chris Mincher from The A.V. Club gave the album a C rating stating that: [...] "Neurotically examining his personality quirks through decidedly unoriginal, un-quirky pop songs, Williams apparently wants to express his individuality with classic-rock reference points and frustratingly nonsensical novelty tracks." ...|$|E
500|$|The guest {{stars in}} this episode re-appeared in {{different}} roles {{later in the}} series. Both Tracey Walter and Mike Gomez re-appeared as other Ferengi in the sixth season episode [...] "". This was the second recorded performance of Armin Shimerman in a TNG episode, although {{the first to be}} broadcast. He has gone uncredited in a previously filmed role as the face of a Betazoid gift box in [...] "". He made a further appearance as a different Ferengi in [...] "" [...] before gaining the main cast role of the Ferengi Quark in [...] In that role he would also shoot a scene for the movie , but it was cut from {{the final version of the}} film. He said of his performance in [...] "The Last Outpost", [...] "I was pretty much playing over-the-top villain – that turned out to be very comical. I thought I was being serious, but obviously, it was not serious. It's because there was no subtlety to the performance, there was no attempt to try to give them some real cojones... It was bad acting. It was <b>just</b> <b>bad</b> acting. They liked it, god bless them, Star Trek liked it." ...|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{following}} {{the end of}} the series. Cast member Wil Wheaton reviewed it in April 2008 for AOL TV. He couldn't remember actually appearing in the episode, {{and it was the first}} time since it was originally broadcast that he had seen it. He said that it wasn't good, but that it was [...] "not as overtly racist as I recalled. I mean, it's certainly not as racist as [...] "Angel One" [...] is sexist, and if the Ligonians hadn't been arbitrarily determined to be entirely African American, it wouldn't have even been an issue." [...] He said that the episode is an example of the type of episodes in the first season that would have resulted in the show being cancelled mid-season if it hadn't been so well supported by the fans and run directly into syndication. James Hunt, whilst writing for Den of Geek, differed from Wheaton's assessment and asserted that the episode was racist. He said that [...] "this isn't <b>just</b> <b>bad</b> television, it's openly offensive, and it seems to do its best effort to undo some of the most important lessons the original series imparted some 25 years after we're supposed to have learned them." [...] Overall, he said that this was [...] "quite possibly the worst piece of Star Trek ever made".|$|E

500|$|Current socio-political {{issues in}} the United States are {{addressed}} on the album, with Vedder claiming the record [...] "deals with real content and the moral issues of our time", and crediting as inspiration both the frustration with George W. Bush being reelected, {{and the birth of}} Vedder's daughter - [...] "Now that I see it as my daughter's planet, I'm even more (angry)." [...] McCready said, [...] "We all feel that we're living in tumultuous, frightening times, and that ranges from the Iraq war to Hurricane Katrina to wiretapping to anything that smacks of totalitarianism. And <b>just</b> <b>bad</b> political decisions being made. We feel that as Americans, and we're frustrated. So a lot of those feelings have come out in these songs." [...] Vedder also added that among all the dark themes [...] "the hope {{was going to be in}} the guitar solos. It was the guitars and drums going at it that was going to lift you out of the dark abyss that I had painted." [...] The Iraq War is addressed in the songs [...] "World Wide Suicide", [...] "Marker in the Sand", and [...] "Army Reserve". The lyrics of [...] "World Wide Suicide" [...] depict anger against the war. Other themes addressed on the album include alcohol use ("Severed Hand"), religion ("Marker in the Sand"), poverty ("Unemployable"), leaving everything behind to seek a fresh start ("Gone"), and loneliness ("Come Back").|$|E

Parker believes all religions are [...] "silly". He states that [...] "All the religions are superfunny to me… The story of Jesus makes no sense to me. God sent his only son. Why could God only have one son and why would he have to die? It's <b>just</b> <b>bad</b> writing, really. And it's really terrible in about the second act." [...] Parker further remarked, Basically… out of all the ridiculous religion stories which are greatly, wonderfully ridiculous—the silliest one I've ever heard is, 'Yeah… there's this big giant universe and it's expanding, it's all gonna collapse on itself and we're all just here just 'cause… just cause.

It really needs eight or nine weeks rest, and that would be plenty, unfortunately that rules out all of the rest of the National Hunt season". With his forced retreat for the campaign, Mullins was still left with the front three challengers in the Champion Hurdle market but his retained jockey Ruby Walsh explained: [...] "It’s like someone whipping the ace out of the pack and handing you the rest of the cards". The injury followed the roller coaster events of Faugheen's season that started with the surprise defeat on reappearance and succeeded with the latest performance for which he was rated the best two-mile hurdler of the century by the official handicappers, as well as the private organizations Timeform [...] and Racing Post. However, Mullins was optimistic about the prospect of Faugheen returning for the next season [...] "The prognosis is very good.. We will just call it quits for this season and hopefully come back as good as new".|$|E

Big Bob {{arrives in the}} village to find Trevor and request a criminal favour. His arrival {{came at a time}} Grace wanted to begin IVF treatment. Wall told an Inside Soap reporter that Bib Bob's arrival meant [...] "something pretty bad is going to happen". She added that it threw a [...] "massive spanner in the works" [...] and ruined Grace's attempts to move away from her life as a gangster. When Big Bob vandalises their home, Grace decides to force Lindsey into helping Big Bob smuggle a sim card into a nearby prison. As the plan failed, Big Bob wants revenge. Trevor finds a box with a lock of Grace's hair inside and then receives a threatening call from Big Bob. He tells Trevor he has kidnapped Grace and demands a £60000 ransom for her safe release. But Grace is okay and they discover that Big Bob has kidnapped Esther after mistaking her identity. Grace and Trevor go on a rescue mission which ends with Big Bob pointing a gun in Grace's face. The story was part of the show's continued theme of playing Grace in dangerous situations. A Hollyoaks publicist stated that it was [...] "more than <b>just</b> <b>bad</b> luck" [...] and warned that Grace has a bad track record with guns.|$|E
