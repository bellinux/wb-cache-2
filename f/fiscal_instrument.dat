50|$|Due to the {{development}} of budget expenditures in the 1990‘s, the Swiss parliament and subsequently the people, voted in favor of a new <b>fiscal</b> <b>instrument</b> to reduce government debt in 2001. The so-called debt brake was enacted in 2003 and reinforced the constitutional principle that expenditures have to be mainly financed by revenues and not through an increase in public debt. The mechanism of the debt brake works in a way that introduces a ceiling on spending that is being calculated on a yearly basis. There are adjustment punishments for exceeded budgets, which in turn will force public debt down in following years. Importantly all sorts of government expenditures are equally covered by the debt brake. The only exception to this rule are extraordinary spendings that have to be approved by both chambers of parliament. This exception is supposed to allow the government to react to emergency situations such as for example disaster relieve or the 2008 UBS bailout.|$|E

General {{equilibrium}} {{models that}} include policy rules for government spending, lump-sum transfers, and distortionary taxation on labor and capital income and on con-sumption expenditures are fit to U.

Second, responses of aggregates to fiscal policy shocks under rich rules vary considerably from responses where only non-distortionary <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments</b> finance debt. Third, in the short run, all <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments</b> except labor taxes react strongly to debt, but long-run intertemporal financing comes from all components of the government’s budget constraint.

40|$|August 2005. Very {{preliminary}} draft. Please do not quote without permission. Abstract: Extending Gali and Monacelli (2004), {{we build}} an N-country open economy model, where each economy {{is subject to}} sticky wages and prices and, potentially, has access to sales and income taxes as well as government spending as <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments</b> to deal with technology shocks once the monetary policy instrument as been given up as part of monetary union. We find that, with empirically plausible degrees of price and wage-stickiness, joining a monetary union imposes significant welfare costs on an economy’s inhabitants when that economy is subject to technology shocks. These costs could be reduced by up to half by utilising <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments,</b> with government spending being particularly effective in responding to idiosyncratic shocks due to its assumed home bias in the purchase of goods. However, even employing all three <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments</b> could not reduce the costs of these shocks to the levels found when the economy stayed out of monetary union and retained use of a monetary policy (and therefore exchange rate) instrument. We also found that implementation lags could significantly affect the ability of <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments</b> to deal with shocks, but that the need to ensure fiscal solvency when utilising tax and spending instruments had negligible welfare consequences.

However, <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments</b> also affect the work effort and labour demand.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the ability of}} the damage based tax mechanism to induce socially optimal outcomes in a controlled laboratory environment which incorporates important aspects of nonpoint pollution problems. Our experimental setting combines a strictly convex damage function with uncertainty in measuring the ambient level of pollution, indefinitely repeated interactions among heterogeneous polluters, limited information on the regulator's side about the polluters' profit functions, and, in half of the experimental conditions, limited information on the polluters' side about the strategic environment. We additionally investigate whether the relative position of the social optimum in the polluters’ emission space has an impact on the efficiency of the <b>fiscal</b> <b>instrument.</b> In almost all implemented conditions, the observed total pollution level is not significantly different from the socially optimal level but compliance at the individual level is rarely observed. Experimental conditions in which polluters have to dramatically reduce their emissions in order to comply with the <b>fiscal</b> <b>instrument</b> lead to higher efficiency levels than those where compliance implies less dramatic reductions. Our most striking result is that less information on the polluters' side is beneficial from a social point of view as the performance of the damage based tax mechanism is higher the less information polluters have about the strategic environment. ...|$|E
40|$|Many of {{the most}} pernicious {{economic}} institutions and policies create entry barriers or manipulate factor prices to transfer resources from entrepreneurs and workers to groups that hold political power. These inefficiencies partly result {{from the fact that}} direct and efficient <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments</b> {{that can be used for}} taxation and redistribution of resources are absent. One might then conclude that increasing state capacity and expanding the set of available <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments</b> should improve the allocation of resources by preventing the use of these inefficient, indirect methods of redistribution. This reasoning ignores the effect of greater state capacity and the change in the set of available <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments</b> on the political equilibrium, however. Because the availability of more efficient means of taxation increases the potential benefits of controlling state power, it also intensifies costly political conflict aimed at capturing the control of the state. This indirect effect counteracts the benefits from more efficient taxation and may dominate the direct benefits. The paper establishes the possibility that the allocation of resources may deteriorate substantially in response to an autonomous increase in state capacity and the set of <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments.</b> It also argues that in the British case, which is a key historical example that points to the central role of increased state capacity in economic development, this change was not autonomous; instead, it was an equilibrium response to changes in political institutions that placed better checks on the exercise of power by the executive. This reasoning suggests that the study of the effect of fiscal capacity and the evaluation of policies aimed at increasing state capacity in less-developed economies should be done in the context of dynamic models of political economy, in which fiscal capacity and political constraints are jointly determined. ...|$|R

40|$|Unstable {{government}} debt dynamics can typically be corrected by various <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments,</b> like appropriate adjustments in government spending, public transfers, or taxes. This paper investigates properties of state-contingent debt targeting rules which link stabilizing budgetary adjustments around a target level of long-run {{debt to the}} state of the economy. The paper establishes that the size of steady-state debt is a key determinant of whether it is possible to find a rule of this type which can be implemented under all available <b>fiscal</b> <b>instruments.</b> Specifically, considering linear feedback rules, the paper demonstrates that there may well exist a critical level of debt beyond which this is no longer possible. From an applied perspective, this finding is of particular relevance {{in the context of a}} monetary union with decentralized fiscal policies.
