25|$|For some inhabitants, Flanders is {{more than}} just a {{geographical}} area or the federal institutions (Flemish Community and Region). Supporters of the Flemish Movement <b>even</b> <b>call</b> it a nation and pursue Flemish independence, but most people (approximately 75%) living in Flanders say they are proud to be Belgian and opposed to the dissolution of Belgium. 20% is even very proud, while some 25% are not proud and 8% is very not proud. Mostly students claim to be proud of their nationality, with 90% of them staying so. Of the people older than 55, 31% claim to be proud of being a Belgian. Particular opposition to secession comes from women, people employed in services, the highest social classes and people from big families. Strongest of all opposing the notion are housekeepers - both housewives and house husbands.|$|E
25|$|While US Airways made immense cuts {{in service}} {{during the early}} 21st century, other {{carriers}} began to play a more dominant role at PIT. The airport's operator, the Allegheny County Airport Authority, has attempted to attract new service to the airport, particularly low-cost and international carriers. AirTran Airways, which had trouble competing in Pittsburgh after beginning service in 2000, was able to expand Pittsburgh offerings after the US Airways cuts. In 2003, USA3000 Airlines began service to Florida and subsequently expanded to include international destinations in the Caribbean. Southwest Airlines began service to Pittsburgh in May 2005 and broke US Airways's monopolies on Tampa, Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Philadelphia, and brought more competition to the Chicago and Orlando markets. As of March 2017, Southwest served 17 destinations from the airport, {{more than any other}} incumbent carrier. JetBlue Airways began service on June 30, 2006 with flights to Boston-Logan and New York-Kennedy, thus in turn breaking US Airways' monopoly on Boston and added more competition to the New York market. Myrtle Beach Direct Air began service in March 2007. Combined increases in competition and diversification of carriers at the airport led to a decline in average airfares by roughly 30%, lowering notoriously high fares once commonplace for the airport. In May 2015, it was announced that Southwest Airlines is looking into possibly expanding in Pittsburgh and maybe <b>even</b> <b>call</b> PIT one of its focus cities. In September 2015, Toronto based regional carrier Porter Airlines began daily non-stop service from Pittsburgh to Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport.|$|E

Franchise creator Akira Toriyama also criticized the film adding he was completely left out of the creative process, despite having himself offered to help, going as far as saying: [...] "the result was a movie, I couldn't <b>even</b> <b>call</b> Dragon Ball".

[...] Cubitt {{went on to say that}} [...] "mine did everything that the Microsoft one is meant to do, but additionally printed information on toilet paper and didn't use a keyboard for the interface due to hygiene reasons". The i-Loo was prototyped by Cubitt as part of his thesis for his 2001 university degree in Product Design and Engineering at Brunel University. In an interview with The Inquirer, he noted [...] "As it was designed at the university, they own the partial rights to the product so they will be watching the Microsoft 'invention' very closely." ...|$|E

500|$|Aronofsky called Black Swan a {{companion}} piece to The Wrestler, recalling {{one of his}} early projects about a love affair between a wrestler and a ballerina. He eventually separated the wrestling and the ballet worlds, considering them as [...] "too much for one movie". He compared the two films: [...] "Wrestling some consider the lowest art—if they would <b>even</b> <b>call</b> it art—and ballet some people consider the highest art. But what was amazing to me was how similar the performers {{in both of these}} worlds are. They both make incredible use of their bodies to express themselves." [...] About the psychological thriller nature of Black Swan, actress Natalie Portman compared the film's tone to Polanski's 1968 film Rosemary's Baby, while Aronofsky said Polanski's Repulsion (1965) and The Tenant (1976) were [...] "big influences" [...] on the final film. Actor Vincent Cassel also compared Black Swan to Polanski's early films, commenting that it was also influenced by Alejandro Jodorowsky's movies and David Cronenberg's early work.|$|E

500|$|The Secret Speech, {{while it}} did not {{fundamentally}} change Soviet society, had wide-ranging effects. The speech {{was a factor in}} unrest in Poland and revolution in Hungary later in 1956, and Stalin defenders led four days of rioting in his native Georgia in June, calling for Khrushchev to resign and Molotov to take over. In meetings where the Secret Speech was read, communists would make even more severe condemnations of Stalin (and of Khrushchev), and <b>even</b> <b>call</b> for multi-party elections. However, Stalin was not publicly denounced, and his portrait remained widespread through the USSR, from airports to Khrushchev's Kremlin office. Mikhail Gorbachev, then a Komsomol official, recalled that though young and well-educated Soviets in his district were excited by the speech, many others decried it, either defending Stalin or seeing little point in digging up the past. Forty years later, {{after the fall of the}} Soviet Union, Gorbachev applauded Khrushchev for his courage in taking a huge political risk and showing himself to be [...] "a moral man after all".|$|E

500|$|The {{book has}} been called [...] "feminist", and more {{specifically}} [...] "vintage Atwood-feminist", but Atwood disagrees, saying, [...] "I wouldn't <b>even</b> <b>call</b> it feminist. Every time you write something {{from the point of}} view of a woman, people say that it's feminist." [...] The Penelopiads antagonistic relationship between Penelope and Helen is similar to the relationships of women in Atwood's previous novels: Elaine and Cordelia in Cat's Eye, and Iris and Laura in The Blind Assassin, and follows Atwood's doubt of an amicable universal sisterhood. The story does endorse some feminist reassessments of the Odyssey, like Penelope recognizing Odysseus while disguised and that the geese slaughtered by the eagle in Penelope's dream were her maids and not the suitors. Using the maids' lecture on anthropology, Atwood satirizes Robert Graves' theory of a matriarchal lunar cult in Greek myth. The lecture makes a series of connections, concluding that the rape and execution of the maids by men represent the overthrow of the matriarchal society in favor of patriarchy. The lecture ends with lines from anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss' Elementary Structures of Kinship: [...] "Consider us pure symbol. We're no more real than money." ...|$|E
500|$|Mahathir {{expressed}} {{discomfort with}} [...] "far too many non-Malay citizens who can swamp the Malays" [...] when [...] "...suddenly it has dawned upon the Malay that he cannot <b>even</b> <b>call</b> Malaya his land. There {{is no more}} Tanah Melayu — land of the Malays. He is now a different person, a Malaysian, but a Malay Malaysian whose authority in Malaya — his land — is now not only shared with others, but shared unequally. And {{as if this is}} not enough, he is being asked to give up more and more of his share of influence." [...] Mahathir's defence of Malay rights focused both on the [...] "definitive people" [...] line of reasoning and the argument in favour of affirmative action, which the Reid Commission had chosen: [...] "It is not... for reasons of Malay superiority that preferential treatment for Malays in scholarship awards was insisted upon. ... They are a means of breaking down the superior position of the non-Malays in the field of education. The Malays are not proud of this treatment." [...] Shortly after becoming Prime Minister, Mahathir denied he had altered any of his views since he wrote the book.|$|E
500|$|In December 2007 the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster was {{credited}} with spearheading successful efforts in Polk County, Florida, to dissuade the Polk County School Board from adopting new science standards on evolution. The issue was raised after {{five of the seven}} board members declared a personal belief in intelligent design. Opponents describing themselves as Pastafarians e-mailed members of the Polk County School Board demanding equal instruction time for the Flying Spaghetti Monster. Board member Margaret Lofton, who supported intelligent design, dismissed the e-mail as ridiculous and insulting, stating, [...] "they've made us the laughing stock of the world". Lofton later stated that she had no interest in engaging with the Pastafarians or anyone else seeking to discredit intelligent design. As the controversy developed, scientists expressed opposition to intelligent design. In response to hopes for a new [...] "applied science" [...] campus at the University of South Florida in Lakeland, university vice president Marshall Goodman expressed surprise, stating, [...] " [...] not science. You can't <b>even</b> <b>call</b> it pseudo-science." [...] While unhappy with the outcome, Lofton chose not to resign over the issue.
