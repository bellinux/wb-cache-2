5|$|The British {{educational}} policies segregating the <b>different</b> <b>races</b> — providing minimal {{public education}} for Malays, and leaving non-Malays {{to their own}} devices — did not help matters. The Malays, predominantly rural-dwellers, were not encouraged to socialise with the more urban non-Malays. The economic impoverishment of the Malays which set them apart from the better-off Chinese also fanned racial sentiments.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} that European {{settlers}} first arrived in South Africa in 1652, the country was divided on racial lines, in common with similar settlements. In contrast to other European colonies, racial distinction and segregation intensified during the early 20th century, and the various ethnic groups became more sharply defined and divided. Following its general election victory in 1948, the National Party, led by Daniel Malan, formalised this racism under a government policy called apartheid. Under apartheid, <b>different</b> <b>races</b> were kept apart {{in all aspects of}} life. This system was thoroughly enforced during the 1950s; any resistance from non-white races was put down and laws, supposedly to prevent the rise of communism, were passed to prevent political agitation.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, Singapore {{attained}} self-government and the City Council was dissolved. The Government {{felt that}} a national anthem was needed to unite the <b>different</b> <b>races</b> in Singapore. The Deputy Prime Minister Toh Chin Chye selected the City Council's song as it was already popular. At Toh's request, Zubir modified the lyrics and melody, and the revised song {{was adopted by the}} Legislative Assembly on 11 November 1959. On 30 November, the Singapore State Arms and Flag and National Anthem Ordinance 1959 was passed to regulate the use and display of these national emblems.|$|E

5|$|Historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony {{noted that}} {{ordinary}} citizens responded to Nixon. When {{a group of}} rural people visited the White House to present a quilt to the First Lady, many were overcome with nervousness; upon hearing their weeping, Pat hugged each individual tightly, and the tension dissipated. When a young boy doubted that the Executive Mansion was her house {{because he could not}} see the washing machine, Pat led him through the halls and up an elevator, into the family quarters and the laundry room. She mixed well with people of <b>different</b> <b>races,</b> and made no distinctions on that basis. During the Nixons' trip to China in 1972, foreign minister Zhou En-lai was suffienciently smitten with her so as to give two rare giant pandas to the ambassador as a gift from China.|$|E
5|$|The Internal Security Act allows {{persons to}} be {{detained}} without trial for acting {{in any manner}} prejudicial {{to the security of}} Malaysia or to the maintenance of its essential services or economic life. It is authorized by Article 149 of the Malaysian Constitution, which stipulates that if an Act recites that action has been taken or threatened by any substantial body of persons, whether inside or outside the Federation in respect of certain situations – including organized violence against persons or property, the excitement of disaffection against the Yang di-Pertuan Agong or the government, or the promotion of feelings of ill-will and hostility between <b>different</b> <b>races</b> or classes of the population likely to cause violence – then any provision of that law designed to stop or prevent that action is valid notwithstanding that it is inconsistent with certain articles of the Constitution guaranteeing fundamental liberties. Upon Singapore's independence from Malaysia in 1965, the island republic retained both the Internal Security Act and Article 149 of the Constitution in its statute book.|$|E
5|$|The Sedition Act, Public Entertainments and Meetings Act, and Public Order Act 2009 are {{statutes}} which arguably impose {{restrictions on}} {{the freedom of speech}} and expression, as well as the freedom of assembly, in the interests of public order. The Sedition Act has been used to restrict the propagation of opinions that have a seditious tendency, which includes a tendency to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between <b>different</b> <b>races</b> or classes of Singapore's population. In Public Prosecutor v. Koh Song Huat Benjamin (2005), the accused was convicted under the Act for posting invective and pejorative anti-Muslim remarks on a blog and a forum on the Internet; and in Public Prosecutor v. Ong Kian Cheong and another (2009), a married couple were similarly convicted for distributing religious tracts that were considered seditious and objectionable to Muslims. The Public Entertainments and Meetings Act renders it an offence to provide public entertainment and hold meetings without a licence, and its constitutionality has been upheld before the courts in cases concerning political activities organized by opposition parties.|$|E

5|$|The Zerg are a {{collective}} consciousness {{of a variety}} of <b>different</b> <b>races</b> assimilated into the Zerg genome. The Zerg were originally commanded by the Zerg Overmind, a manifestation of this hive mind, and under the Overmind's control the Zerg strove for genetic perfection by assimilating the favorable traits of other species. After a species has been assimilated into the Swarm, it is mutated towards a different function within its hierarchy, from being a hive worker to a warrior strain. StarCrafts manual notes that some species bear little resemblance to their original forms after just a short time into assimilation (An example would be the formerly peaceful Slothien species, which was assimilated and mutated into the vicious Hydralisk strain and so on). The Overmind controls the Swarm through secondary agents called cerebrates. Cerebrates command an individual brood of Zerg, each with a distinct tactical role within the hierarchy. Cerebrates further delegate power through the use of overlords for battlefield direction and queens for hive watch.|$|E
5|$|The {{frame of}} the {{building}} was constructed from reinforced concrete, which was then clad in Portland stone. Several highly detailed sculptures adorn {{the outside of the}} building, including ones of Britannia and Neptune, as well as others representing peace, war, and storms. There are also sculptures of the Zodiac and the coat of arms of the United Kingdom's allies during the First World War. Another series of sculptures on the building depict <b>different</b> <b>races</b> from around the world, which reflect the global operations of the Cunard company. Marble was used to furnish several parts of the inside of the building, particularly on the ground floor corridors that link the north and south entrances. It was imported from several locations in Italy and Greece, including Attica, Carrara, and Arni Alto.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} spawned several written adaptations and related merchandise. Starting in 2003, {{a series of}} Final Fantasy XI novels was written by Miyabi Hasegawa and {{released}} in Japanese, German, and French. Additionally, in 2004, Adventure Log, a webcomic by Scott Ramsoomair, was commissioned by Square Enix starting in 2007. Final Fantasy XI PlayOnline Visa and MasterCard credit cards were available in Japan, with features including no annual fees as long as cardholders remain PlayOnline subscribers and various other rewards. There have also been posters with limited edition phone cards and keychains released, also exclusively in Japan. Several T-shirts have been made available for order in North America, and various stuffed animals and gashapon figurines have also been made available to order of <b>different</b> <b>races</b> from the series. A Vana'diel clock which displayed the in-game time was also marketed, as well as CDs of the game's music.|$|E

5|$|The Malaysian Census 2010 Report {{estimated}} {{the population of}} Kota Kinabalu at 452,058. The city's population today {{is a mixture of}} many <b>different</b> <b>races</b> and ethnicities. Non-Malaysian citizens form the majority of the city population with 110,556 people followed by Chinese (93,429), Bajau/Suluk (72,931), Kadazan-Dusun (69,993), other Bumiputras (59,107), Bruneian Malays (35,835), Murut (2,518), Indian (2,207) and others (5,482). The Chinese are mostly Hakkas and reside mainly in the Luyang area. There is also a sizeable Cantonese-speaking population and smaller communities of Hokkien and Foochow-speaking Chinese scattered throughout all areas of the city. Most of the Foochow speakers in particular emigrated to Sabah from the neighbouring Malaysian state of Sarawak. Penampang district is populated mainly by Kadazans, while Bajaus and Dusuns mainly reside in Likas, Sembulan, Inanam, Menggatal, Sepanggar and Telipok. The Brunei Malays and Bajau/Suluks are Muslims. The Kadazan-Dusuns and Muruts mainly practice Christianity, Islam or Animism, whilst the Chinese are mainly Buddhists, Taoist or Christians. There are numerous Roman Catholic, Basel (Lutheran), Anglican, Evangelical, and Methodist churches throughout the city. A small number of Hindus, Sikhs, Animists, and secularists can also be found.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenario}} {{was based}} around {{the concept of}} five <b>different</b> <b>races,</b> and the interaction with a human character. The story premise of a human character becoming {{a member of one}} of the five playable races was born out of a compromise about who and what the player character should be. The concept of a non-human character was introduced by Horii as he saw an inherent contradiction in the idea of a human saving the other tribes. This raised some contention among the staff including Fujisawa due to the Dragon Quest series' established convention of a human as the main protagonist, but Fujisawa and Horii decided to have the player character be a human first and later become one of the five tribes. Part of the story's initial drama came from the player character growing accustomed to their new form. Once the basic scenario concept had been finalized, the team commissioned the various character designs from Toriyama. In contrast to the greater majority of MMORPGs, which did not seem to have a solid ending, the team wanted to create a definitive ending with a final boss as featured in normal RPGs.|$|E

While a character will begin with more advanced skills in his own race's ships, a character of another race can reach the same proficiency through training. Thus, players are encouraged to use starships that meet their preferred style of play, and the game does not place incentives for playing as one race over another.
