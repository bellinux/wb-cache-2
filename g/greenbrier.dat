5000|$|Like the Sugarlands and Roaring Fork to the west, <b>Greenbrier's</b> bottomlands and streambeds are {{coated with}} sandstone, phyllite, and slate rocks of all sizes. During the Ice Ages, {{the cold weather}} caused {{fracturing}} of the high mountain slopes, creating boulder fields. Over the centuries, erosional forces carried these boulders to lower elevations. [...] <b>Greenbrier's</b> residents used these rocks for fencing in lieu of barbed wire, creating the long rock walls that criss-cross the area today.|$|R

5|$|Plantations {{continued}} to develop along {{the fringes of}} present-day West Virginia. By {{the close of the}} 18th century, Harman Blennerhassett had constructed a mansion on his plantation on Blennerhassett Island and Moses Shepherd had built Shepherd Hall near Wheeling, both in the Ohio River valley. Despite the agricultural development of then western Virginia's bottomlands and the resulting wealth of the plantation owners, the hinterlands of the Allegheny Mountains and Allegheny Plateau regions remained underpopulated and inhabited by subsistence farmers of meager means {{into the middle of the}} 19th century. By the 1860 United States Census, Berkeley, <b>Greenbrier,</b> Hampshire, Hardy, Jefferson, Kanawha, and Monroe counties consequently had the largest populations of slaves in present-day West Virginia.|$|E
5|$|On May 27, 1862, Colonel Crook's 3rd Brigade routed rebel {{infantry}} in {{a conflict}} where the shooting lasted for only 27 minutes. Rebel casualties were 72 men killed, over 100 wounded, and 157 men taken prisoner. They also lost four cannon, 300 small weapons, and 25 horses. Crook's brigade lost 13 killed, 50 wounded (including Crook, who {{was shot in the}} foot), and 6 missing. The feat was accomplished by taking advantage of aggressive rebel soldiers and a hostile town. Crook had learned that a large rebel infantry under the command of General Henry Heth was moving toward Lewisburg. Crook positioned his brigade {{at the far end of}} the town, and sent a small group of pickets to the opposite end where the rebels would approach. Heth's rebels raced into town after the pickets, urged on by the pro-rebel local population. The rebels were quickly ambushed in a short action that ended after a charge by Union infantry and cavalry. The 2nd Loyal Virginia Cavalry battalion had been held out of the fighting, but was used to chase the fleeing rebels. The rebels escaped by burning the <b>Greenbrier</b> Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Woods had a poor showing at the 2013 U.S Open as {{a result}} of an elbow injury {{sustained}} at The Players Championship. In finishing at 13-over-par, he recorded his worst score ever as a professional and finished 12 strokes behind winner Justin Rose. After a prolonged break because of the injury, during which he missed the <b>Greenbrier</b> Classic and his own AT National, he returned at the Open Championship at Muirfield. Despite being in contention all week and beginning the final round only two strokes behind Lee Westwood, he struggled with the speed of the greens and could only manage a 3-over-par 74 that left him tied for 6th place, five strokes behind eventual winner Phil Mickelson. Two weeks later, Woods returned to form at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, recording his 5th win of the season and 8th win at the event in its 15-year history. His second round 61 matched his record score on the PGA Tour and could easily have been a 59 were it not for some short missed birdie putts on the closing holes. This gave him a seven stroke lead that he held onto for the rest of the tournament. Woods would never contend at the PGA Championship at Oak Hill Country Club and would come short of winning a major for the 5th full season, only contending in two of the four majors in 2013.|$|E

40|$|This PNVG {{occurs on}} coastal dunes and flats on barrier islands, on mainlands {{adjacent}} to salt water and along fresh and tidewater steams some distance above and especially below {{the region of}} fresh/salt water mixing. It also includes associated dunes, some marshes, swales, beaches and palmetto communities. Vegetation Description Live oak (Quercus virginiana) is the most characteristic species in the maritime forest. Other common canopy dominants include laurel oak (Quercus laurifolia), loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) and slash pine (Pinus elliottii). Species of more sheltered stands may include cherrybark oak (Quercus pagoda), pignut hickory (Carya glabra), sand hickory (Carya pallida) and other oaks and hickories. Coastal fringe stands from central South Carolina south may have sabal palm (Sabal palmetto) in the understory beneath hardwoods and pine or as the canopy dominant on marsh fringes, flats and shallow sloughs. Some typical shrubs include yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), wax myrtle (Myrica cerifera), saw palmetto (Serenoa repens) and coral bean (Erythrina herbacea). Vines, especially <b>greenbriers</b> (Smilax rotundifolia, S. bona-nox, and S. glauca), are abundant.

50|$|During {{the early}} Cenozoic era, the sea began {{to retreat from}} Montana for the last time. Extreme tectonic {{activity}} helped form local mountains and raised much of the state's elevation. Local levels of precipitation rose and fell. Montana was home to creatures like dogs and titanotheres. The Tertiary deposits from the southwestern {{part of the state}} are one of the best sources of plant and insect fossils in North America. More than two hundred species of plants, insects, and fishes are known from these deposits. The flora included water lilies and lotuses. During the Tertiary Montana was home to swamps that would later leave coal behind. The invertebrate fauna consisted of ants, bees, beetles, earwigs, caddisflies, crane flies, damselflies, lantern flies, mayflies, grasshoppers, leafhoppers, mosquitoes, snails, and wasps. Contemporary vertebrate fossils included feathers and, once in a while, a bird. Among the Oligocene flora of Montana were ailanthus, ash, beech, cattails, cedar, cinquefoil, dogwood, elm, ferns, milfoil fernbush, gooseberry, climbing grapes, grasses, <b>greenbriers,</b> horsetails, ironwood, katsura tree, liverwort, mountain mahogany, maple, false mermaid, mosses, oak, pennycress, pondweed, dawn redwood, roses, sedges, smoke tree, snowberry, spiraea, false strawberry, and vetches. Similar floras are known from the Florissant of Colorado and Oregon. Montana's Miocene plants and mollusks left behind remains at Bear Butte, northwest of Melville in Sweet Grass County's Fort Union Beds. The Miocene mammals preserved in the Fort Union beds included arctocyonids, insectivores, multituberculates, pantodonts, primates, taeniodonts. During the Miocene Montana was also home to camels and horses. Later into the Cenozoic Montana became colder and wetter. Glacial activity scoured the state. At this time mammoths, musk oxen, and dire wolves lived in the areas of the state not covered by glaciers.|$|R
