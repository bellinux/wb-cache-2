40|$|Compton {{scattering}} of low-frequency radiation by an isotropic distribution of (i) mildly and (ii) ultra relativistic electrons is considered. It is {{shown that the}} ensemble-averaged differential cross-section {{in this case is}} noticeably different from the Rayleigh phase function. The scattering by an ensemble of ultra-relativistic electrons obeys the law p= 1 - cos #alpha#, where #alpha# is the scattering angle; hence photons are preferentially scattered backwards. This contrasts the forward scattering behaviour in the <b>Klein-Nishina</b> regime.
