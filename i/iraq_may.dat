5|$|As a major general, Walker was {{appointed}} General Officer Commanding, Eastern District, before becoming Assistant Chief of the Defence Staff at the Ministry of Defence. He took command of NATO's Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC), which deployed to the Balkans in 1995, Walker {{becoming the first}} officer to command the land component of the NATO-led Implementation Force. For his service with the multi-national forces in the Balkans, {{he was awarded the}} American Legion of Merit. After relinquishing command of the ARRC, Walker spent three years as Commander in Chief, Land Command, before being appointed Chief of the General Staff—the professional head of the British Army—in 2000. In 2003, he was promoted to Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS)—the professional head of all the British Armed Forces. While CDS, Walker attracted controversy during the modernisation of the armed forces, over allegations of prisoner abuse during the Iraq War, and over comments that the media coverage of <b>Iraq</b> <b>may</b> have endangered British troops.|$|E

500|$|After {{the initial}} push into Fallujah, the US argued that Zarqawi was behind {{a series of}} car bombings {{throughout}} Iraq. [...] There had been no large car bombings in Baghdad during the siege, and enough munitions and contraband had been uncovered to conclude that many [...] "bombs and car bombs detonated elsewhere in <b>Iraq</b> <b>may</b> have been manufactured in Fallujah." [...] In contrast, there were 30 large car bombs in the two months following {{the creation of the}} Fallujah Brigade, and the Brigade was now seen by the US and Iraqi governments as a front for the insurgency. The suicide bombings and the hostage videos made Zarqawi the public face of the Iraqi insurgency in 2004, even though his leadership was disputed by many Sunni nationalist commanders. By late 2004 the US government's bounty on his head matched Osama bin Laden's. However, a senior US military intelligence official described the core of the insurgency in December 2004 as [...] "the old Sunni oligarchy using religious nationalism as a motivating force." ...|$|E

2500|$|John McCain's {{support for}} the troop 'surge' {{employed}} by General David Petraeus, {{which was one of}} several factors credited with improving the security situation in <b>Iraq,</b> <b>may</b> have boosted McCain's stance on the issue in voters' minds. McCain (who supported the invasion) argued that his {{support for the}} successful surge showed his superior judgment. However, Obama was quick to remind voters that {{there would have been no}} need for a [...] "surge" [...] had there been no war at all, thus questioning McCain's judgment.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2012, it was {{reported}} that Russia and <b>Iraq</b> <b>may</b> sign a $4.2–$5.0 billion weapons contract, including 30 Mi-28N helicopters. The deal was confirmed on 9 October. The deal {{was reported}}ly cancelled due to Iraqi concerns of corruption, but that concern was addressed, and the Iraqi defense minister stated that [...] "the deal is going ahead." [...] Despite early complications, all parts of the $4.2 billion contracts were signed, and are being executed. [...] The first contract for 10 Mi-28NE helicopters for Iraq will begin delivery in September 2013. A batch of 13 Mi-28NE helicopters was delivered in January 2014.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the paper}} is often {{considered}} to be [...] "linked inextricably" [...] to the Labour Party, three of The Guardian four leader writers joined the more centrist Social Democratic Party on its foundation in 1981. The paper was enthusiastic in its support for Tony Blair in his successful bid to lead the Labour Party, and to be elected Prime Minister. On 19 January 2003, {{two months before the}} 2003 invasion of Iraq, The Guardian reported: [...] "Military intervention in the Middle East holds many dangers. But if we want a lasting peace it may be the only option. [...] War with <b>Iraq</b> <b>may</b> yet not come, but, conscious of the potentially terrifying responsibility resting with the British Government, we find ourselves supporting the current commitment to a possible use of force." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cole {{was asked}} to address {{the pros and cons}} of the {{building}} war against Iraq in January 2003 for the journal of the University of Michigan International Institute. He warned that any invasion of Iraq would inevitably be rejected by Iraqis and the Arab world as a form of neocolonialism. He wrote, [...] "The Sunnis of Iraq could well turn to groups like al-Qaida, having lost the ideals of the Baath. Iraqi Shi'ites might become easier to recruit into Khomeinism of the Iranian sort, and become a bulwark for the shaky regime in Shi'ite Iran." [...] Considering the problem of ethnic politics, he said, [...] "A post-war <b>Iraq</b> <b>may</b> well be riven with factionalism that impedes the development of a well-ensconced new government." [...] He rejected the argument that Baathist Iraq's [...] "weapons of mass destruction" [...] or backing of terrorism posed threats to the United States. [...] Cole admitted that he had had [...] "mixed feelings" [...] on the issue—i.e., he opposed Saddam Hussein's regime, but feared disaster and opposed international illegality. He was insistent that any war would be illegal without a UN Security Council resolution (which was not obtained by the Bush administration). His position on the war resembled that of the French government, which is generally held to have opposed it. By January 2003, he said he had become [...] "cynical" [...] about the Bush administration motives for the war. On the day of the U.S. invasion Cole wrote that [...] "for all the concerns one might have about the aftermath, the removal of Saddam Hussein and the murderous Baath regime from power will be worth the sacrifices that are about to be made on all sides." [...] He has explained that this posting was not intended to show support for the invasion: [...] "The passage quoted ... was not about whether the war was legal or not. Being from a military family, it mattered to me as an ethical issue whether troops lives were being lost for no good reason, in an illegal boondoggle. I decided on careful deliberation that even though the war was wrong, the lives lost would not be in vain, since a tyrannical regime would have fallen. To say that some good could come of an illegal act is not to endorse the illegal act." ...|$|E
