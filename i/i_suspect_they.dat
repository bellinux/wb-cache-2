500|$|As the world's {{worst in}} a 2004 report on {{countries}} with poor earthquake engineering, Iran is especially prone to earthquakes. In addition, poor construction practice has exacerbated death tolls; 1 in 3,000 Iranians has {{died in an}} earthquake-related incident. Roger Bilham, {{a professor at the}} University of Colorado declared that [...] "Most of Iran needs rebuilding. If the population of Iran had a choice between spending oil revenues on munitions or houses that won't kill them, <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>they</b> would choose a safe home. It's all a matter of earthquake education." [...] The United Nations developed a Common Country Assessment for Iran, stating, [...] "While adequate building regulations exist for large cities, it is generally believed that they are not rigorously adhered to... most of those who have suffered in recent major earthquakes have lived in small towns and villages. Earthquake-proof construction is very rare in those areas and adequate building regulations are not yet in place".|$|E
2500|$|This book {{is meant}} to be a useful, working and {{evolving}} tool and should not be nitpicked on details that are not relevant to its purpose. The authors are not producing a treatise on each family with hot-off-the-press reclassifications. <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>they</b> are following Vaught's classification which has been out for a few years, and is by no means perfect or up-to-date, but is readily available and inexpensive, and thus a good choice. But if so, this standard should be identified in the introduction, so that one knows where to find a shell. Also, typos are found in almost every book, and this is no exception, but they do not lessen the useful information, which is the main reason why we will buy this book. Two thumbs up! ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to its geological threat, Iran has poor earthquake engineering. In a 2004 report by ScienceDaily, it was listed as [...] "the worst offender" [...] globally for poor earthquake engineering. [...] Professor Roger Bilham of the University of Colorado at Boulder, a geophysicist who specializes in earthquake-related deformation and hazards, blames construction practices {{for the fact that}} {{since the start of the}} 20th century, 1 in 3,000 Iranians has died in an earthquake-related incident. Bilham adds, [...] "Most of Iran needs rebuilding. If the population of Iran had a choice between spending oil revenues on munitions or houses that won't kill them, <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>they</b> would choose a safe home. It's all a matter of earthquake education." [...] A Common Country Assessment by The United Nations for Iran has similar results, stating that, [...] "While adequate building regulations exist for large cities, it is generally believed that they are not rigorously adhered to... most of those who have suffered in recent major earthquakes have lived in small towns and villages. Earthquake-proof construction is very rare in those areas and adequate building regulations are not yet in place".|$|E

6000|$|... "There, Hawe! What did I tell you?" [...] demanded Stewart. [...] "I {{came over}} here {{to take charge of}} this ranch. I found these boxes hidden in an unused room. <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> what <b>they</b> were. Contraband goods!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{have the}} same jumble of motives and traditions, <b>I</b> <b>suspect,</b> whether <b>they</b> are eventful or not. The brakes may be strong or weak but the drive is the same.

6000|$|... "They may not; but <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>they</b> {{think they}} can carry any {{connection}} they choose to make, and I mostly {{think they can}}--ten generations of Quaker ancestry--" ...|$|E
60|$|Once more, {{the mists}} were rising as I walked away. If they {{disclosed}} to me, as <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>they</b> did, that I should not come back, and that Biddy was quite right, all I can say is,--they were quite right too.|$|E
6000|$|... "As for the bumps," [...] {{replied the}} man, looking at himself with much pride, [...] "I {{was born with}} them and <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>they</b> were {{a gift from the}} fairies. They make me look rugged and big, like the {{mountain}} I serve." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They are {{the best}} I've ever had; but do you know, Paddy, <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> that <b>they</b> {{may be one of}} the reasons I am hunted so," [...] replied Lightfoot a little sadly. [...] "Good looks are not always to be desired. Have you seen any hunters around here lately?" ...|$|R

6000|$|Osmond {{took a sip}} of a {{glass of}} wine; he looked {{perfectly}} good-humoured. [...] "My dear Amy," [...] he answered, smiling as if he were uttering a piece of gallantry, [...] "I don't know anything about your convictions, but if <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> that <b>they</b> interfere with mine it would be much simpler to banish YOU." ...|$|R
60|$|Aha! The eaters {{are going}} to be eaten in turn. Those are the {{mackerel}} themselves; and <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>they</b> see Mr. Whale, and are scrambling {{out of the way as}} fast as they can, lest he should swallow them down, a dozen at a time. Look out sharp for him now.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hardly know}} as yet. It would about kill her and Fanny, {{if they were}} told all that <b>I</b> <b>suspect.</b> <b>They</b> are stiff-necked, obstinate, ill-conditioned people--that is, the men.

6000|$|... 'I {{beg your}} pardon. Some bodies lose their wits, like your friend Aubrey, who tells me, {{if he had}} stood still, he would have fainted away.

2500|$|Addressing {{his earlier}} {{statement}} comparing actors to cattle, Hitchcock {{said in an}} interview with François Truffaut:I'm not quite sure in what context I might have made such a statement. It may have been made ... when we used actors who were simultaneously performing in stage plays. When they had a matinee, and <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>they</b> were allowing themselves plenty of time for a very leisurely lunch. And this meant that we had to shoot our scenes at breakneck speed so that the actors could get out on time. I couldn't help feeling that if they'd been really conscientious, they'd have swallowed their sandwich in the cab, on the way to the theatre, and get there in time to put on their make-up and go on stage. I had no use for that kind of actor.|$|R
60|$|This {{seems to}} be the parent-form of our {{improved}} English Pouters. I kept a pair, but <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> that <b>they</b> were not pure birds. They are smaller than English pouters, and less well developed in all their characters. Neumeister (5/7. 'Das Ganze der Taubenzucht' Weimar 1837 pl. 11 and 12.) says that the wings are crossed over the tail, and do not reach to its extremity.|$|R
60|$|At {{the mouth}} of the tunnel she met Oliver, as {{probably}} she had arranged to do, and after he had reported progress to her, wandered away with him as usual, each of them carrying a lamp, into some recess of the buried city. I followed them at a distance, not from curiosity, or because I wished {{to see more of the}} wonders of that city whereof I was heartily sick, but because <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> that <b>they</b> were being spied upon.|$|R
6000|$|... "And then," [...] {{answered}} Wildrake, [...] "I {{should have}} waked with a headache, Mark; for I see my modest sip has not exempted me from that epilogue.-- But {{let us go}} forth, {{and see how the}} night, which we have passed so strangely, has been spent by the rest of them. <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>they</b> are all right willing to evacuate Woodstock, unless they have either rested better than we, or at least been more lucky in lodgings." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's--all--right!" [...] Kennicott was aggressively awake now. [...] "He'll {{work right}} in with Westlake and McGanum. Matter of fact, <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>they</b> were largely {{responsible}} for his locating here. They'll be sending him patients, and he'll send all {{that he can get}} hold of to them. I don't trust anybody that's too much hand-in-glove with Westlake. You give Dillon a shot at some fellow that's just bought a farm here and drifts into town to get his teeth looked at, and after Dillon gets through with him, you'll see him edging around to Westlake and McGanum, every time!" ...|$|E
6000|$|The ape-man {{turned to}} her. [...] "Pan-at-lee," [...] he said, [...] "these beasts may keep us treed here indefinitely. I doubt {{if we can}} escape together, but I have a plan. You remain here, hiding {{yourself}} in the foliage, while I start back across the gorge in sight of them and yelling to attract their attention. Unless they have more brains than <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>they</b> will follow me. When they are gone you make for the cliff. Wait {{for me in the}} cave not longer than today. If I do not come by tomorrow's sun you will have to start back for Kor-ul-ja alone. Here is a joint of deer meat for you." [...] He had severed one of the deer's hind legs and this he passed up to her.|$|E
5000|$|Protest {{movements}} {{may or may}} {{not engage}} in violence against property or persons. Students of American social movements have been very timid about this issue. They tend to ignore episodes of violence that do occur, excluding them by fiat from their definition of social movements. <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> that <b>they</b> are influenced by their sympathy for…the much-proclaimed [...] "nonviolence" [...] of the civil rights movement… Just as nonviolence can be strategic, so can violence be used strategically, and often defensively to permit the disruptive action, the withdrawal of cooperation, to continue.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{guess he}} must do some good," [...] {{admitted}} Jenny Wren rather grudgingly. [...] "I've seen him picking up worms and grubs, but he likes grain, and I have a suspicion that if his family becomes very numerous, and <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> it will, <b>they</b> will eat more of Farmer Brown's grain than they will pay for by the worms and bugs they destroy.

"ReGenesis are {{not only}} as good as the genuine 1970s article, <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> that <b>they</b> may very well often be better, {{especially}} on the most intricate aspects of the original band's catalogue.

60|$|I {{have seen}} her. The figure I beheld is, and is not, my Charlotte--my thirty years' companion. There {{is the same}} {{symmetry}} of form, though those limbs are rigid which were once so gracefully elastic--but that yellow masque, with pinched features, which seems to mock life rather than emulate it, can it be the face that was once so full of lively expression? I will not look on it again. Anne thinks her little changed, because the latest idea she had formed of her mother is as she appeared under circumstances of sickness and pain. Mine {{go back to a}} period of comparative health. If I write long in this way, I shall write down my resolution, which I should rather write up, if I could. I wonder how I shall do with the large portion of thoughts which were hers for thirty years. <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>they</b> will be hers yet for a long time at least. But I will not blaze cambric and crape in the public eye like a disconsolate widower, that most affected of all characters.|$|E
6000|$|Tarifa {{is perhaps}} the quaintest town left in the world, either {{in or out of}} Spain, but whether it is more Moorish than parts of Cordova or Seville I could not say. It is at least {{pre-eminent}} in a feature of the women's costume which you are promised at the first mention of the place, and which {{is said to be a}} survival of the Moslem civilization. Of course we were eager for it, and when we came into the first wide street, there at the principal corner three women were standing, just as advertised, with black skirts caught up from their waists over their heads and held before their faces so that only one eye could look out at the strangers. It was like the women's costume at Chiozza on the Venetian lagoon, but there it is not claimed for Moorish and here it was authenticated by being black. [...] "Moorish ladies," [...] our guide proudly proclaimed them in his scanty English, but <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>they</b> were Spanish; if they were really Orientals, they followed us with those eyes single as daringly as if they had been of our own Christian Occident.|$|E
60|$|When we {{left the}} Madeleine we took {{our way to the}} Place de la Concorde, and thence through the Elysian Fields (which, I suppose, are the French idea of heaven) to Bonaparte's triumphal arch. The Champs Elysees may look pretty in summer; though <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>they</b> must be {{somewhat}} dry and artificial at whatever season,--the trees being slender and scraggy, and requiring to be renewed every few years. The soil is not genial to them. The strangest peculiarity of this place, however, to eyes fresh from moist and verdant England, is, that there is not one blade of grass in all the Elysian Fields, nothing but hard clay, now covered with white dust. It gives the whole scene the air of being a contrivance of man, in which Nature has either not been invited to take any part, or has declined to do so. There were merry-go-rounds, wooden horses, and other provision for children's amusements among the trees; and booths, and tables of cakes, and candy-women; and restaurants on the borders of the wood; but very few people there; and doubtless we can form no idea of what the scene might become when alive with French gayety and vivacity.|$|E
60|$|Perhaps our {{suspicions of}} the lad {{prompted}} {{us to see}} more than really was presented; but certain it is I fancied that the officer, who was mounted, plied Horry with questions, to which the lad replied as if it gave him pleasure to impart information. <b>I</b> also <b>suspected</b> <b>they</b> were saying somewhat concerning our plantation, for now and again Horry pointed {{in the direction of}} my home, and the foot soldiers looked back as if fancying they might see the buildings in the distance, all of which was the more real to me because betwixt where we stood and the Hamilton plantation there was no other dwelling.|$|R
6000|$|... "Partly {{because of}} {{inherited}} prejudice, {{and partly because}} of their allegiance to opposing theories; and finally, <b>I</b> <b>suspect,</b> because <b>they</b> are connected with institutions that would not sanction such work. You can imagine how the physical department of a denominational college would investigate spirit phenomena! It was much the same way in England during the early part of last century, but they are far in advance of us now. The first notable {{step in the right direction}} was taken--as perhaps you may know--in 1869, by the Dialectical Society of London, which appointed a committee to look into the subject of spiritualism, with the expectation, no doubt, of being able to stop the spread of the delusion.|$|R

6000|$|I have uniformly {{found the}} gendarmes civil, and even obliging; and I {{have seen them}} show great {{forbearance}} on various occasions. As to the marvellous stories we {{have heard of the}} police of Paris, <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>they</b> have been gotten up for effect, such things being constantly practised here. One needs be behind the curtain, in a great many things, to get a just idea of the true state of the world. A laughable instance has just occurred, within my knowledge, of a story that has been got up for effect. The town was quite horrified lately, with an account, in the journals, of a careless nurse permitting a child to fall into the fossé of the great bears, in the Jardin des Plantes, and of the bears eating up the dear little thing, to the smallest fragment, before succour could be obtained. Happening to be at the garden soon after, in the company of one connected with the establishment, I inquired into the circumstances, and was told that the nurses were very careless with the children, and that the story was published in order that the bears should not eat up any child hereafter, rather than because they had eaten up a child heretofore! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's plain enough," [...] said he, [...] "that this is {{the work}} of one of the black-hearted crooks who have been {{stealing}} our furs, for 'tis my belief that there is probably more than one and likely not over two." [...] Alec nodded concurrence with this belief. [...] "That they'll stop at nothing Sparrer's experience proves. I've known murder to be committed for less than the price of a prime black fox pelt. Now that they've got it 'tis like that they will pull camp at once rather than take the chance of being discovered. On the other hand they may think that their camp is so well hidden that they can just lie low. If, as <b>I</b> <b>suspect,</b> <b>they</b> have been run {{out of one of the}} Canadian lumber camps, this may be what they will do. They know that Sparrer here is a tenderfoot and that there is only his word against theirs. Besides, they can hide the pelt and deny all knowledge of it. Sparrer hasn't a shred of proof but the lump on his head, and it would take more than that to convince a court of law in these parts that he had killed a genuine black fox.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mind," [...] {{he began}} again, lifting one arm from the elbow, {{the palm of}} the hand outwards, so that, with his legs folded before him, he had the pose of a Buddha preaching in European clothes and without a lotus-flower--"Mind, {{none of us would}} feel exactly like this. What saves us is efficiency--the devotion to efficiency. But these chaps were not much account, really. They were no colonists; their {{administration}} was merely a squeeze, and nothing more, <b>I</b> <b>suspect.</b> <b>They</b> were conquerors, and for that you want only brute force--nothing to boast of, when you have it, since your strength is just an accident arising from the weakness of others. They grabbed what they could get for the sake of what was to be got. It was just robbery with violence, aggravated murder on a great scale, and men going at it blind--as is very proper for those who tackle a darkness. The conquest of the earth, which mostly means the taking it away from those who have a different complexion or slightly flatter noses than ourselves, is not a pretty thing when you look into it too much. What redeems it is the idea only. An idea at the back of it; not a sentimental pretence but an idea; and an unselfish belief in the idea--something you can set up, and bow down before, and offer a sacrifice to...." ...|$|E
5000|$|Darwin later {{compared}} the different tortoise forms {{with those of}} mockingbirds, in the first tentative statement linking his observations from the Galapagos {{with the possibility of}} species transmuting:"When I recollect the fact that from the form of the body, shape of scales and general size, the Spaniards can at once pronounce from which island any tortoise may have been brought; when I see these islands in sight of each other and possessed of but a scanty stock of animals, tenanted by these birds, but slightly differing in structure and filling the same place in nature; <b>I</b> must <b>suspect</b> <b>they</b> are only varieties ...

5000|$|While {{mid-19th century}} California law did not {{explicitly}} permit {{the killing of}} Native Americans, it also prevented any non-white (i.e., Native American) witnesses providing evidence against white defendants needed. According to Californian state law, the punishment for stealing livestock was 25 lashes and a 200 dollar fine (Lindsay, 202). Many White settlers apparently found such a measure too lenient and not enough to deter the Indians from “stealing” their livestock. They often raided Indian villages and executed {{the men and women}} on the spot. More gruesome still, they often put down the children and infants as well. This is clearly a violation of state law and outright murder. Unfortunately, because of the legal loopholes and widespread support for those killings, these men were never persecuted by law. these things definitely happened, the article, as written, strongly implies that such events were rampant; <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> that <b>they</b> were indeed common on a small scale but that [...] "bigger" [...] events such as the Bridge Gulch massacre were rare. The article badly needs a well-researched re-write that acknowledges the atrocities but doesn't descend into hyperbole.|$|R
