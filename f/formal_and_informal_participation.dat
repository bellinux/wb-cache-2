Elaborating on one possible {{element of a}} successful human response, this paper looks at how participatory governance is treated in the literatures on social justice and climate change.

Applying this general framework to {{a case study of}} Durban, South Africa, the paper then discusses the effectiveness of participatory structures in practice. This case study provides a productive space to study the intersection of social and environmental concerns. It also allows us to explore how interactions between <b>formal</b> <b>and</b> <b>informal</b> <b>participation</b> expose the limits both of confrontational (Foucauldian) and of consensus-based (Habermassian) approaches to governance. These limitations are instructive as we attempt to create cities that are both socially just and environmentally sustainable. ...|$|E

The vast array of informal channels available to development interests can mean that they have little need to participate formally; thus a primary and secondary layer of influence on policy formulation can be distinguished.

40|$|PURPOSE: Loneliness {{can affect}} people {{at any time}} and for some it can be an {{overwhelming}} feeling leading to negative thoughts and feelings. The current study, based on the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey in England, 2007, quantified the association of loneliness with a range of specific mental disorders and tested whether the relationship was influenced by <b>formal</b> <b>and</b> <b>informal</b> social <b>participation</b> <b>and</b> perceived social support. METHODS: Using a random probability sample design, 7, 461 adults were interviewed in a cross-sectional national survey in England in 2007. Common Mental Disorders were assessed using the revised Clinical Interview Schedule; the diagnosis of psychosis was based on the administration of the Schedules of the Clinical Assessment of Neuropsychiatry, while loneliness was derived from an item in the Social Functioning Questionnaire. RESULTS: Feelings of loneliness were more prevalent in women (OR =  1. 34, 95  % CI 1. 20 - 1. 50, P <  0. 001) as well as in those who were single (OR =  2. 24, 95  % CI 1. 96 - 2. 55, P <  0. 001), widowed, divorced or separated (OR =  2. 78, 95  % CI 2. 38 - 3. 23, P <  0. 001), economically inactive (OR =  1. 24, 95  % CI 1. 11 - 1. 44, P =  0. 007), living in rented accommodation (OR =  1. 73, 95  % CI 1. 53 - 1. 95, P <  0. 001) or in debt (OR =  2. 47, 95  % CI 2. 07 - 1. 50, P <  0. 001). Loneliness was associated with all mental disorders, especially depression (OR =  10. 85, 95  % CI 7. 41 - 15. 94, P <  0. 001), phobia (OR =  11. 66, 95  % CI 7. 01 - 19. 39, P <  0. 001) and OCD (OR =  9. 78, 95  % CI 5. 68 - 16. 86, P <  0. 001). Inserting measures of <b>formal</b> <b>and</b> <b>informal</b> social <b>participation</b> <b>and</b> perceived social support into the logistic regression models did significantly reduce these odds ratios. CONCLUSION: Increasing social support and opportunities for social interaction may be less beneficial than other strategies emphasising the importance of addressing maladaptive social cognition as an intervention for loneliness. 11233...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the paper}} {{is to provide a}} {{regional}} approach to analyse sports participation in two different contexts: organised/formal versus non-organised/informal participation, using the England's Active People Survey (APS) national dataset. Method: We have estimated two models: first, a general model to explain differences in regional informal and formal participation rates; second, an econometric model dealing with formal participation at a regular frequency. Results: The results emphasise the different roles played by some correlates depending on the context of sports participation under study. Only economic and cultural variables seem to have a general influence throughout all the sports participation contexts. The results reinforce the role played by sport supply and sport funding in some sports participation levels, offering interesting implications for sport policy. The urban environment, for example, appears to be positively related to the transition from informal to formal sport participation. Conclusions: The distinct analysis of the sports participation contexts provides the opportunity to evaluate ways of boosting that participation as well as to suggest some interesting policy implications towards this aim. For example, sporting infrastructure is only influential for the transition from non-participation to formal participation, implying that in general the key question about sport funding and supply is not the amount of funds but rather the direction and aims of sport policy. Finally, the paper offers some explanations about the gender inequality detected in some forms of sports participation.

40|$|As well {{as being}} a growing {{academic}} literature, SWB is now firmly on the public policy agenda. Likewise, the sports industry is viewed as being of growing economic significance, reflected in its promotion in public policy. This paper explores the impact of engagement with sports on individual subjective well-being (SWB) for a sample of 34 countries. Engagement with sports is defined to include <b>formal</b> <b>and</b> <b>informal</b> <b>participation,</b> as well as attendance at sports events. It is hypothesized that one dimension of SWB associated with sports by individuals in a country is the pride felt by them {{as a result of}} international sports success. To provide a robust account of the determinants of these dimensions of SWB a variety of estimators are employed that also account for any feedback between them. Account is also taken of different country level effects on the impacts. Controlling for standard covariates associated with SWB the results suggest that all forms of sports engagement enhance SWB. However, it is suggested that there is also an indirect impact of pride felt from international sporting success on SWB. Crucially, these effects are, in part, determined by formal participation in sport, or attendance at sport events but not informal participation. Further, {{there is some evidence that}} pride has a strong country-level dimension. A further interesting policy dilemma raised by the research is that passive engagement at sports is more likely to raise SWB.

40|$|The study {{compares the}} formal and {{informal}} social participation of 60 - 69 year olds in The Netherlands in 1992 and 2002, and examines which attributes of the two cohorts favour social participation. Using data from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam, {{it was found that}} cohort differences in formal participation (as members of organisations, in volunteer work and in religious organisations) and in informal participation (having a large social network, and in cultural and recreational activities) associated with cohort differences in individual characteristics (level of education, health, employment status and marital status). Descriptive analyses showed an increase between 1992 and 2002 in all forms of participation except religious involvement. The 2002 cohort members were more educated and more engaged in employment, but in worse health and had a higher prevalence of divorce than the 1992 cohort members. Logistic regression analyses showed that the positive effect on social participation of the recent cohort's higher educational level was suppressed by the negative effect of their worse health. Being divorced had mixed effects on <b>formal</b> <b>and</b> <b>informal</b> <b>participation,</b> but the difference in the number of divorcees did not explain cohort differences in social participation.

40|$|The {{voices of}} older women are rarely heard in {{debates about the}} health of {{disadvantaged}} groups. Despite growing interest in health in old age, the health experiences of older women as gendered social beings have yet to be fully explored. Their potential to contribute positively to family and community health is seldom acknowledged. The aim {{of this article is to}} present findings from a qualitative British Health Development Agency funded project on the relationship between social capital, health and gender, focusing on the health and social networks of older women in a socially disadvantaged community in the north of England. Seventy-seven community members were interviewed, of these 19 were older women aged 55 - 78 years. Their accounts of ill health in the context of ageing were analysed to explore the intricate ways in which social capital was created, maintained and linked to health. Findings suggest that social constructions of motherhood and caring underpinned responsibility for their own and others' health. Their experiences of dealing with health matters, together with frequent health talk, gave the women confidence as lay health experts, enabling them to contest medical advice. Drawing on personal experiences of trust and reciprocity, they recognised the importance of social networking in alleviating the problems of loneliness and isolation. At stressful times in their lives they were able to draw on existing support networks and, in spite of occasional personal conflicts, some benefited from the empowering and health-enhancing role of <b>formal</b> <b>and</b> <b>informal</b> <b>participation</b> in community life.

40|$|The {{literature}} on EU integration has long {{recognized that the}} European Commission has promoted a pan‐European civil society {{in order to increase}} the legitimacy of the supranational institutions. While we know the Commission fosters EU civil society by encouraging their <b>formal</b> <b>and</b> <b>informal</b> <b>participation</b> in the EU policymaking processes and by directly funding them (Mahoney 2004), we have, until now, known very little about just how much money the Commission has been granting EU civil society organizations and to which segments of European civil society. This paper tests whether the Commission’s stated goals and the assumptions of EU integration scholars are reflected in the reality of its funding practices. We present analyses from two original databases: 1. The Commission’s own registry of 685 civil society organizations which includes information about the groups and the funding they have received from the Commission; and 2. A database of 1, 164 civil society groups that received funding from the Commission from 2003 ‐ 2007. The findings show that the Commission’s funding decisions do indeed reflect its goals of supporting a supranational EU civil society through its support of groups organized at the EU‐level (over groups organized at the national and sub‐national level) and through its support of EU integration groups; European youth, education and intercultural exchange groups; and citizenship, democracy promotion and education groups. The findings also show however, {{that when it comes to}} societal cohesion, the Commission’s funding practices are not in line with its rhetoric. Rather than equal funding across member states, or extra support for the civil society groups of the new member states, it is the oldest and wealthiest members that are receiving the largest numbers of grants and the largest amounts of funding.

40|$|Two {{questions}} were {{addressed in the}} present study: Do residential settings of varying levels of con-straint influence life satisfaction? Do such settings involve different correlates of life satisfaction? A total of 129 male and female ambulatory residents were surveyed in settings {{of high and low}} con-straint on the following measures: life satisfaction, developmental task resolution, self-acceptance, perceived autonomy, activity level, health and educational level. Stepwise regression, covariance, and t-test analyses indicated: (1) life satisfaction and developmental task accomplishment were greater in the lower constraining setting; (2) the selected correlates resulted in multiple correlations of. 675 and. 590 with satisfaction; (3) differing sets of correlates significantly predicted satisfaction in each set-ting: health the most important in the high constraining setting and perceived autonomy and self-concept important to the low constraining setting; (4) developmental task success significantly predicted satisfaction in both settings.

The author does not attempt to establish casuality between economic reforms, {{and the types of}} jobs that men and women hold. Instead, she provides {{a detailed description of the}} trends in male, <b>and</b> female <b>formal,</b> <b>and</b> <b>informal</b> sector <b>participation</b> during the economic reform period in Argentina, Brazil, and Costa Rica. The author first compares the gender composition of the <b>formal,</b> <b>informal</b> wage, <b>and</b> self-employment sectors in a year before reforms (1988 for Argentina, 1989 for Brazil, and Costa Rica), and a year after reforms implementation (1997 for Argentina, 1995 for Brazil and Costa Rica). Although women continued to be more likely than men to work in the informal wage sector, there is no trend of"masculinization"or"feminization"of the informal sector, or any other. Instead, in Argentina men have overtaken women as the most prevalent workers in the informal wage sector, while in Brazil, the opposite has occurred (as men move into self-employment). In Costa Rica there have been no statistical, observable changes. The author then considers the distribution across sectors within each gender group, to identify whether men, and women are more likely to select different sectors in the post-reform period relative to the pre-reform period. Among both men, and women in all three countries (except Brazilian men), workers have become more likely to hold <b>informal</b> wage jobs, <b>and</b> less likely to hold formal sector jobs. Trends in human capital accumulation explain these changes for both men, and women, while changes in gender roles, primarily in homecare and marriage, do not seem to have an effect.

40|$|Background: The student-run clinic (SRC) has the {{potential}} to address interprofessional learning among health professions students. Purpose: To derive a framework for understanding student learning during team-based care provided in an interprofessional SRC serving underserved patients. Methods: The authors recruited students for a focus group study by purposive sampling and snowballing. They constructed two sets of semi-structured questions for uniprofessional and multiprofessional groups. Sessions were audiotaped, and transcripts were independently coded and adjudicated. Major themes about learning content and processes were extracted. Grounded theory was followed after data synthesis and interpretation to establish a framework for interprofessional learning. Results: Thirty-six students from four professions (medicine, physician assistant, occupational therapy, and pharmacy) participated in eight uniprofessional groups; 14 students participated in three multiprofessional groups (N = 50). Theme saturation was achieved. Six common themes about learning content from uniprofessional groups were role recognition, team-based care appreciation, patient experience, advocacy-/systems-based models, personal skills, and career choices. Occupational therapy students expressed self-advocacy, and medical students expressed humility and self-discovery. Synthesis of themes from all groups suggests a learning continuum that begins with the team huddle and continues with shared patient care and social interactions. Opportunity to observe and interact with other professions in action is key to the learning process. Discussion: Interprofessional SRC participation promotes learning ‘with, from, and about’ each other. Participation challenges misconceptions and sensitizes students to patient experiences, health systems, advocacy, and social responsibility. Learning involves interprofessional interactions in the patient encounter, reinforced by <b>formal</b> <b>and</b> <b>informal</b> communications. <b>Participation</b> is associated with interest in serving the underserved and in primary care careers. The authors proposed a framework for interprofessional learning with implications for optimal learning environments to promote team-based care.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsTimothy J. DaltonSmallholder {{farmers in}} Tanzania remain {{susceptible}} to food insecurity and poverty. To combat these challenges, {{the country and}} development organizations have turned to agriculture. In particular, value chains {{have been identified as}} a point of interest. Specifically, the maize value chain is of critical importance since maize is the staple crop of the country as well as the staple carbohydrate in the Tanzanian diet. Markets are beneficial because they enable households to specialize in agricultural production according to their comparative advantage. Specifically, markets {{have been shown to be}} one tool for increasing welfare, measured through the proxy income. The objective of this thesis is to identify the determinants of a household’s decision to participate in the maize market as well as identify the determinants of a household’s decision regarding how much maize to sell in a given market. This research examines <b>formal</b> <b>and</b> <b>informal</b> market <b>participation</b> among 908 households during the 2008 long rainy season. Probit models were estimated to determine market <b>participation</b> for the <b>formal,</b> <b>informal,</b> <b>and</b> aggregate sale market levels. A Heckman OLS model was used to further analyze the value sold by the household in a given market. Econometric results indicate that “quantity harvested” positively and significantly impacts market participation decisions as well as value sold decisions. The variable “male-headed households” was positive and significant in the formal market while the variable showed no significant impact in the <b>informal</b> market <b>participation</b> model. Both “radio ownership” and “mobile telephone ownership” proved to be positive and significant in the formal model while only the ownership of a radio was significant in the informal market. Additionally it was found that for the formal market participation decision, “bicycle ownership” was positive and significant. Overall, it appears that households participate in the informal market as a way to meet cash needs since farmers were not price-responsive. However, in the formal market farmers were found to be very price-responsive, following neo-classical economic theory...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{uses the}} {{empirical}} approach {{to propose a}} method of defining optimal span of control for an enterprise, and leads to a conclusion, that efficiency of organizational function performance within company management can be estimated {{with the use of}} span of control criteria. In our opinion, maximum span of control is the result of multiplying two independent variables: company individual managing index (kind index) by index that estimates how many managers control single operation independently (kim index). So a company should try to maximize span of control {{while at the same time}} minimizing the number of managers. Definition of these independent variables implies identification of the number of managers who manage one operation independently (for instance, kind for matrix organizational structure would be 2). The second independent variable is proposed to be defined on the basis of estimation of company primary leader's type, coincidence of <b>formal</b> <b>and</b> <b>informal</b> leadership, employee <b>participation</b> in decision-making, correlation by employees their own results with the company results, predictability of environment, level of disturbance in organizational communications, coincidence of job to the types of employee personality.

As part of a CEA of cervical cancer screening in five developing countries, we supplemented limited primary cost data by developing other estimation techniques for direct medical and non-medical costs associated with alternative screening approaches using one of three initial screening tests: simple visual screening, HPV DNA testing, and cervical cytology. Here, we report estimation methods and results for three cost areas in which data were lacking. Methods To supplement direct medical costs, including staff, supplies, and equipment depreciation using country-specific data, we used alternative techniques to quantify cervical cytology and HPV DNA laboratory sample processing costs. We used a detailed quantity and price approach whose face validity was compared to an adaptation of a US laboratory estimation methodology. This methodology was also used to project annual sample processing capacities for each laboratory type. The cost of sample transport from the clinic to the laboratory was estimated using spatial models. A plausible range of the cost of patient time spent seeking and receiving screening was estimated using only <b>formal</b> sector employment <b>and</b> wages as well as using both <b>formal</b> <b>and</b> <b>informal</b> sector <b>participation</b> <b>and</b> country-specific minimum wages. Data sources included primary data from country-specific studies, international databases, international prices, and expert opinion. Costs were standardized to year 2000 international dollars using inflation adjustment and purchasing power parity. Results Cervical cytology laboratory processing costs were I$ 1. 57 – 3. 37 using the quantity and price method compared to I$ 1. 58 – 3. 02 from the face validation method. HPV DNA processing costs were I$ 6. 07 – 6. 59. Rural laboratory transport costs for cytology were I$ 0. 12 – 0. 64 and I$ 0. 14 – 0. 74 for HPV DNA laboratories. Under assumptions of lower resource efficiency, these estimates increased to I$ 0. 42 – 0. 83 and I$ 0. 54 – 1. 06. Estimates of the value of an hour of patient time using only formal sector participation were I$ 0. 07 – 4. 16, increasing to I$ 0. 30 – 4. 80 when <b>informal</b> <b>and</b> unpaid labor was also included. The value of patient time for traveling, waiting, and attending a screening visit was I$ 0. 68 – 17. 74. With the total cost of screening for cytology and HPV DNA testing ranging from I$ 4. 85 – 40. 54 and I$ 11. 30 – 48. 77 respectively, the cost of the laboratory transport, processing, and patient time accounted for 26 – 66 % and 33 – 65 % of the total costs. From a payer perspective, laboratory transport and processing accounted for 18 – 48 % and 25 – 60 % of total direct medical costs of I$ 4. 11 – 19. 96 and I$ 10. 57 – 28. 18 respectively. Conclusion Cost estimates of laboratory processing, sample transport, and patient time account for a significant proportion of total cervical cancer screening costs in five developing countries and provide important inputs for CEAs of alternative screening modalities. </p...|$|R
40|$|Cooperation between kindergartens and {{families}} has been changing throughout history. People did {{not used to}} place great importance on such cooperation, but legislation today obligates kindergartens to cooperate with parents. Since it {{is the role of}} both parents and kindergarten teacher to care for and stimulate children's development, cooperation is even more important. The foundations for good cooperation are willingness on the side of parents and of teacher, mutual trust and open relationships. The better the communication skills the teachers have, the better the relationships with the parents they can establish. A kindergarten teacher who is a good listener, who can express themself clearly and thoroughly, who can change their perspective on an issue, who knows how to encourage and receive parents' opinions, is able to contribute to better cooperation and a trusting relationship if parents are willing to do the same. Some parents may come to disagree with the kindergarten teacher. When that happens it is even more important for a teacher to be skilled in communication. In writing this diploma thesis we sought to discover parents' perspective on cooperation with kindergartens and on the work kindergartens do. To do so, we interviewed 59 parents whose children are in kindergarten. Based on our survey results we have concluded that parents place great importance on kindergarten for their child, since kindergarten is not merely day care, but also provides a good foundation for the child's development. Parents assess their cooperation with kindergarten teacher as good. Parents do not see the teachers' advice as very important, but they generally bear it in mind. With medium to high frequency parents observe changes in their children when they follow the teachers’ advice. The frequency of conflicts between parents and teacher is encouragingly low, revealing open relationships between them; the majority of parents say conflicts are resolved by talking to the teacher. Most parents are satisfied with the activities that kindergartens offer; just a small percentage of parents are less satisfied with what is offered. They find both <b>formal</b> <b>and</b> <b>informal</b> activities reasonable. <b>Participation</b> in activities is not significantly contingent on the parents’ level of education, but we think we didn’t have enough interviewees to definitively claim this. The main reason for not participating in activities is a lack of time, which is due to, among other things, obligations at work. ...|$|R

The theoretical part describes {{the position of}} nonprofit organizations in <b>formal</b> <b>and</b> <b>informal</b> education. Attention is paid to definition of the terms non-profit and contributory organization, the concepts of <b>formal</b> <b>and</b> <b>informal</b> education <b>and</b> the laws regulating the action of non-profit and contributory organizations {{in the field of}} education in the Czech Republic. In the practical part, the qualitative survey is realized, focused on the position of nonprofit and contributory organizations in the field of <b>formal</b> <b>and</b> <b>informal</b> education from the perspective of their directors. The research based of semi- structured interviews with directors of the nonprofit organizations finds what positive an negative effects influences activities of the stated organizations in <b>formal</b> <b>and</b> <b>informal</b> education <b>and</b> how is the cooperation with state authorities. Among the most important findings is, that the nonprofit sector is fully established in both <b>formal</b> <b>and</b> <b>informal</b> education in the Czech Republic, the availibility of grants is good, although the administrative burden is very high.

30|$|This is a {{three-fold}} decomposition (Winsborough and Dickinson 1971), {{where the}} first term represents the “endowments effect” and explains the differences that are due to worker characteristics (such as education, sector of employment, occupation, etc). The second term reflects the “coefficients effect,” which shows {{the differences in the}} estimated returns to <b>formal</b> <b>and</b> <b>informal</b> sector workers’ characteristics. Lastly, the third term, the “interaction effect,” accounts for the fact that differences in endowments <b>and</b> coefficients between <b>formal</b> <b>and</b> <b>informal</b> sector workers exist simultaneously. If <b>formal</b> <b>and</b> <b>informal</b> sector workers obtain equal returns for their characteristics, the second and the third part in equation (3) will equal zero and earnings differentials between <b>formal</b> <b>and</b> <b>informal</b> sector workers will be explained by the differences in endowments alone.|$|R
