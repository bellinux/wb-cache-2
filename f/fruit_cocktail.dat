His ignorance of the South Pacific caused him to erroneously describe coconuts as being soft and easily opened; a stickler for accuracy he resolved that in future, whenever possible, he would write only about things he had personal experience of. Ballantyne wrote The Coral Island while staying in {{a house on the}} Burntisland seafront opposite Edinburgh on the Firth of Forth in Fife. According to Ballantyne biographer Eric Quayle he borrowed extensively from an 1852 novel by the American author James F. Bowman, The Island Home. He also borrowed from John Williams' Narrative of Missionary Enterprises (1837), to the extent that cultural historian Rod Edmond has suggested that Ballantyne must have written one chapter of The Coral Island with Williams' book open in front of him, so similar is the text. Edmond describes the novel as [...] "a <b>fruit</b> <b>cocktail</b> of other writing about the Pacific", adding that [...] "by modern standards Ballantyne's plagiarism in The Coral Island is startling".|$|E

In Nigeria, watermelon are fermented, blended and consumed as juice, nectars, <b>fruit</b> <b>cocktails</b> and can also be used as an appetizer or snacks, depending on how it is prepared (Kerje and Grum 2003; Onyeleke and Olaniyan 2007; Oms-Oliu et al. 2009; Enukainure et al. 2010). The seeds are also reported to possess medicinal properties and are used to treat chronic or acute eczema. It contains high levels of proteins, lipids and is a rich source of carbohydrate and fibre. Arginine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid and leucine are the predominant amino acids in watermelon proteins. Reports are also available on the biological value, true digestibility, protein efficiency ratio and net protein utilisation of watermelon seeds (Wani et al. 2011; Lawal 2011; Inuwa et al. 2011). Moreover, they are used as a domestic remedy for urinary tract infection, hepatic congestion, catarrh, worm remedy, abnormal blood pressure (Amadi et al. 2003). Watermelon contain large amount of beta carotene and are significant sources of lycopene (Collins et al. 2005). The production of wine from common fruits could help reduce the level of post-harvest losses and increases the variety of wines (Okoro 2007; Alobo and Offonry 2009).|$|R
40|$|It is {{primarily}} {{used as a}} fungistat and as a mold and yeast inhibitor. Most applications are in post-harvest handling and processing for food preservation and extension of shelf-life (Dorko et al., 1997). Among the food uses include use as a preservative in baked goods, chocolate, soda fountain syrups, <b>fruit</b> <b>cocktails,</b> cheeses, and artificially sweetened jellies (Winters, 1989). It is also used in fruit waxes (Nelson, 1981). These handling and processing uses are not considered in this current review. There are few references to uses of potassium sorbate, sorbic acid, or other sorbic acid salts used as crop fungicides in general or seed treatments in particular. While some experiments were conducted in the late 1960 s and early 1970 s, one reference {{found in the literature}} indicates that sorbic acid and potassium sorbate are of little value for this purpose (Davis and Pinckard, 1971). More recent experiments and inventions claim that potassium sorbate is effective as a mold inhibitor with other synthetic fungicides used in tissue culture (Guri and Patel, 1998). Action: The exact mechanism by which sorbic acid and its potassium salt inhibits microbial growth is not entirely understood. No single mechanism appears to explain the range of toxicity to various spoilage organisms. Sorbic acid inhibits the transport of carbohydrates into yeast cells, inhibits oxidative and fermentative assimilation, and uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in a variety of bacteria (Dorko et al., 1997). Other mechanisms proposed appear {{to be related to the}} inability of molds to metabolize sorbic acid (Lindsay, 1996). Combinations: Potassium sorbate was petitioned to be used as a seed treatment with sodium propionate and various unspecified polymers used to coat seed (Patil, 2001). It is also used in a number of combinations for food and feed processing (Dorko et al., 1997). Citric acid can be used as a stabilizer for sorbic acid and its salts (Montagna and Lashley, 1958). Sorbic acids and its salts may have a synergistic effect with various synthetic fungicides when used in plant tissue culture media (Guri an...|$|R
