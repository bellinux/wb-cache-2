5|$|Cellular {{automaton}} {{models of}} this system divide the square lattice into two alternating subsets, and perform updates {{on one of the}} two subsets at a time. In each update, <b>every</b> <b>cell</b> that can flip does so. This defines a reversible cellular automaton which can be used to investigate the Ising model.|$|E
5|$|A {{cellular}} automaton {{consists of an}} array of cells, each one of which has {{a finite number of}} possible states, together with a rule for updating all cells simultaneously based only on the states of neighboring cells. A configuration of a {{cellular automaton}} is an assignment of a state to <b>every</b> <b>cell</b> of the automaton; the update rule of a cellular automaton forms a function from configurations to configurations, with the requirement that the updated value of any cell depends only on some finite neighborhood of the cell, and that the function is invariant under translations of the input array.|$|E
5|$|The Critters rule is a block {{cellular}} automaton in which, at each step, {{the cells of}} the automaton are partitioned into 2×2 blocks and each block is updated independently of the other blocks. Its transition function flips the state of <b>every</b> <b>cell</b> in a block that does not have exactly two live cells, and in addition rotates by 180° blocks with exactly three live cells. Because this function is invertible, the automaton defined by these rules is a reversible {{cellular automaton}}.|$|E

5|$|Cell theory {{states that}} the cell is the {{fundamental}} unit of life, that all living things are composed {{of one or more}} cells, and that all cells arise from other cells through cell division. In multicellular organisms, <b>every</b> <b>cell</b> in the organism's body derives ultimately from a single cell in a fertilized egg. The cell is also considered to be the basic unit in many pathological processes. In addition, the phenomenon of energy flow occurs in cells in processes {{that are part of the}} function known as metabolism. Finally, cells contain hereditary information (DNA), which is passed from cell to cell during cell division. Research into the origin of life, abiogenesis, amounts to an attempt to discover the origin of the first cells.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Zoe Reynolds (Keeley Hawes) goes {{undercover}} to pose as a sympathizer to the cell. She lures a member, Rachel (Rachel Power) to {{the same}} hospital Sarah Lynott is being treated; Sarah would later die from the extent of her injuries. Senior case officer and team leader Tom Quinn (Matthew Macfadyen) attempts to persuade her to stop Kane, believing she has little regard for any life. Rachel leaves in haste, but unbeknownst to her, MI5 bug her mobile phone, and record a phone conversation she makes to the cell regarding their next target, Diane Sullivan, a doctor living in London. Tom's team are able to take Sullivan to safety whilst Zoe poses as the target. The team see Kane deliver a bomb to Zoe's car, and prepares to detonate it via mobile phone. To counter the attack, a Bomb Squad jams the signal long enough for Tom to arrest her. During the interrogation, Tom promises to send her to a state in the US where the death penalty does not apply {{in exchange for the}} locations of <b>every</b> <b>cell</b> she runs in the UK. After she cooperates, Tom goes back on the deal and delivers Kane to CIA liaison Christine Dale (Megan Dodds), who returns her to Florida to be executed.|$|E
5|$|More {{than half}} of all known cancers involve {{mutations}} of p53, a tumor suppressor protein present in <b>every</b> <b>cell</b> which regulates the cell cycle and signals for cell death in the event of damage to DNA. Specific mutations in p53 can disrupt these functions, allowing an abnormal cell to continue growing unchecked, resulting in the development of tumors. Analysis of these mutations helps explain the root causes of p53-related cancers. In 2004, Folding@home was used to perform the first molecular dynamics study of the refolding of p53's protein dimer in an all-atom simulation of water. The simulation's results agreed with experimental observations and gave insights into the refolding of the dimer that were formerly unobtainable. This was the first peer reviewed publication on cancer from a distributed computing project. The following year, Folding@home powered a new method to identify the amino acids crucial for the stability of a given protein, which was then used to study mutations of p53. The method was reasonably successful in identifying cancer-promoting mutations and determined the effects of specific mutations which could not otherwise be measured experimentally.|$|E

25|$|A {{germline}} mutation {{gives rise}} to a constitutional mutation in the offspring, that is, a mutation that is present in <b>every</b> <b>cell.</b> A constitutional mutation can also occur very soon after fertilisation, or continue from a previous constitutional mutation in a parent.|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} much {{uncertainty}} as to whether metastasis requires mutation {{at the time of}} spread. Here, we use clinical data to calculate the probability of the spread of melanoma and breast cancer cells. These calculations reveal that the probability of the spread of cancer cells is relatively high for small tumours (∼ 1 event of spread for <b>every</b> 500 <b>cells</b> for melanomas of 0. 1 [*]mm) and declines as tumours increase in size (∼ 1 event of spread for <b>every</b> 108 <b>cells</b> for melanomas of 12 [*]mm). The probability of spread of breast cancer cells from the lymph nodes to the periphery is ∼ 1 event of spread for <b>every</b> 108 <b>cells</b> in the nodal masses, which have a mean diameter of 5 [*]mm, while the probability of spread of cancer cells from the breast to the periphery when the primary masses are 5 [*]mm is also ∼ 1 event of spread for <b>every</b> 108 <b>cells.</b> Thus, the occurrence of an event of spread from the breast to the lymph nodes appears not to increase the propensity of the progeny of those cells to spread from the lymph nodes to the periphery. These values indicate that the spread of human breast cancer and melanoma cells is unlikely to occur by a mechanism requiring mutation at the time of spread...|$|R

25|$|Mitochondrial {{diseases}} are {{a group of}} disorders caused by dysfunctional mitochondria, the organelles that generate energy for the cell. Mitochondria are found in <b>every</b> <b>cell</b> {{of the human body}} except red blood cells, and convert the energy of food molecules into the ATP that powers most cell functions.|$|E
25|$|The initial pattern {{constitutes}} {{the seed of}} the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to <b>every</b> <b>cell</b> in the seed—births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick (in other words, each generation is a pure function of the preceding one). The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.|$|E
25|$|It {{is usually}} assumed that <b>every</b> <b>cell</b> in the {{universe}} starts in the same state, except for {{a finite number of}} cells in other states; the assignment of state values is called a configuration. More generally, it is sometimes assumed that the universe starts out covered with a periodic pattern, and only a finite number of cells violate that pattern. The latter assumption is common in one-dimensional cellular automata.|$|E

25|$|Circulatory {{systems are}} absent in some animals, {{including}} flatworms. Their body cavity has no lining or enclosed fluid. Instead a muscular pharynx {{leads to an}} extensively branched digestive system that facilitates direct diffusion of nutrients to all cells. The flatworm's dorso-ventrally flattened body shape also restricts the distance of any cell from the digestive system or {{the exterior of the}} organism. Oxygen can diffuse from the surrounding water into the cells, and carbon dioxide can diffuse out. Consequently, <b>every</b> <b>cell</b> is able to obtain nutrients, water and oxygen without the need of a transport system.|$|E

They also contain high amounts of chromatin. Type II cells have prominent nuclei and nucleoli with much less chromatin than Type I cells. Type III cells have multiple mitochondria and large vesicles. Type I, II, and III cells also contain synapses. Type IV cells are normally rooted at the posterior end of the taste bud. <b>Every</b> <b>cell</b> in the taste bud forms microvilli at the ends.|$|E
