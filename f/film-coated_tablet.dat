Raltegravir can be used in treatment-naïve and -experienced patients, {{as well as for the}} treatment of multidrug-resistant infection. Raltegravir exists in two formulations: a <b>film-coated</b> <b>tablet</b> administered orally at 400 mg twice daily, and a chewable tablet administered orally at 300 mg twice daily. In 2011, raltegravir was also approved for the treatment of children and adolescents, ages 2 – 18 years. For adolescents (ages 12 – 18 years), the recommended dose is 400 mg twice daily (<b>film-coated</b> <b>tablet).</b> If children (ages 6 – 12 years) weigh at least 25 kg, the <b>film-coated</b> <b>tablet</b> is recommended at 400 mg twice daily. Otherwise, patients receive the chewable tablet according to weight-based dosing at approximately 6 mg/kg/dose.

Methods: MS core tablets were manufactured using a direct compression method. Opadry yellow 20 A 82938 aqueous coating dispersion was used as the film-coating material. Dissolution of the <b>film-coated</b> <b>tablets</b> was tested in 900 mL of 0. 5 % sodium lauryl sulfate solution and the bioequivalence of the tablets was tested by comparing them with a reference formulation &ndash; Singulair&reg; tablets. In vitro&ndash;in vivo correlation was evaluated. The stability of the obtained <b>film-coated</b> <b>tablets</b> was evaluated according to International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use guidelines. Results: The efficiency of the film coating was determined by subjecting the coated tablets to gastric pH and drug release was analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography. The coated tablets had no obvious defects. MS release met the study criterion of not less than 80 % dissolved after 30 minutes in 0. 5 % sodium lauryl sulfate solution. Statistical comparison of the main pharmacokinetic parameters clearly indicated no significant difference between test and reference in any of the calculated pharmacokinetic parameters. Level A correlation between in vitro drug release and in vivo absorption was found to be satisfactory. Conclusion: These findings suggest that aqueous film coating with Opadry yellow 20 A 82938 is an easy, reproducible, and economical approach for preparing stable MS <b>film-coated</b> <b>tablets</b> without affecting the drug-release characteristics.

Patients and methods: This study was a randomized, single-blind, two-period, two-sequence crossover study that included 18 healthy adult male and female subjects under fasting condition. The pharmacokinetic parameters were determined based on the concentrations of bisoprolol (CAS 66722 - 44 - 9), using ultraperformance liquid chromatography with a tandem mass spectrometer detector. In each of the two study periods (separated by a washout of 1 week) a single dose of test or reference product was administered. The pharmacokinetic parameters assessed were area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to 48 hours (AUCt), AUC from time zero to infinity (AUCinf), the peak plasma concentration of the drug (Cmax), time needed to achieve Cmax (tmax), and the elimination half-life (t&frac 12;). Results: The geometric mean ratios (90 % confidence intervals) of the test drug/reference drug for bisoprolol were 101. 61 % (96. 14 %&ndash; 107. 38 %) for AUCt, 101. 31 % (95. 66 %&ndash; 107. 29 %) for AUCinf, and 100. 28 % (93. 90 %&ndash; 107. 09 %) for Cmax. The differences between the test and reference drug products for bisoprolol tmax and t&frac 12; values were not statistically significant (P &gt; 0. 05). There was no adverse event encountered during this bioequivalence test. The 90 % confidence intervals of the test/reference AUC ratio and Cmax ratio of bisoprolol were within the acceptance range for bioequivalence.
