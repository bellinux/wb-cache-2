40|$|Leg {{vascular}} {{resistance is}} calculated as the arterial-venous pressure gradient divided by blood flow. During orthostatic challenges {{it is assumed}} that the hydrostatic pressure contributes equally to leg arterial, as well as to leg venous pressure. Because of venous valves, one may question whether, during orthostatic challenges, a continuous hydrostatic column is formed and if leg venous pressure is equal to the hydrostatic pressure. The purpose of this study was, therefore, to measure <b>intravenous</b> <b>pressure</b> in the great saphenous vein of 12 healthy individuals during 30 degrees and 70 degrees head-up tilt and compare this with the calculated hydrostatic pressure. The height difference between the heart and the right medial malleolus level represented the hydrostatic column. The results demonstrate that there were no differences between the measured <b>intravenous</b> <b>pressure</b> and the calculated hydrostatic pressure during 30 degrees (47. 2 +/- 1. 0 and 46. 9 +/- 1. 5 mmHg, respectively) and 70 degrees head-up tilt (83. 9 +/- 0. 9 and 85. 1 +/- 1. 2 mmHg, respectively). Steady-state levels of <b>intravenous</b> <b>pressure</b> were reached after 95 +/- 12 s during 30 degrees and 161 +/- 15 s during 70 degrees head-up tilt. In conclusion, the measured leg venous pressure is similar to the calculated hydrostatic pressure during orthostatic challenges. Therefore, the assumption that hydrostatic pressure contributes equally to leg arterial as well as to leg venous pressure during orthostatic challenges can be made...|$|E
40|$|Case Description: A 6 {{year old}} {{castrated}} male chocolate Labrador Retriever {{presented to the}} Cornell's Orthopedic Service. A diagnosis of left cranial cruciate rupture prompted a tibial plateau leveling osteotomy. Post-operative complications included severe erosive gastritis and esophagitis. Clinical Findings: An esophageal endoscopy revealed multifocal to coalescing erythematosous circular lesions. The stomach contained severe multifocal hemorrhages to diffuse erosions and significant amounts of digested blood. The dog was diagnosed with severe erosive gastritis and esophagitis. Treatment and Outcome: Management included fluid and <b>intravenous</b> <b>pressure</b> maintenance, blood products, pain management, and gastroprotectants. The hematemesis resolved and the anemia and hypoproteinemia improved before discharge. Clinical Relevance: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug administration was strongly suspected as a cause for the erosive gastritis. Although cyclooxygenase selectivity is unclear in canines, inhibition of either form could lead to gastric disturbances. Concomitant administration of otic steroids and oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may have exacerbated side effects...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: Elevated {{intracranial}} <b>intravenous</b> <b>pressure</b> {{seems to}} be of importance in pseudotumor cerebri syndromes, either as a cause (secondary intracranial hypertension) or as a consequence (idiopathic intracranial hypertension) of increased intracranial pressure. We present 3 case reports in which diagnostic imaging before and after CSF diversion provided evidence that narrowing of the transverse sinuses is a secondary phenomenon. Stent angioplasty of the venous sinuses {{should not be considered}} a therapeutic approach in these cases. The recent debate about the etiology of pseudotumor cere-bri focuses on the role of elevated intracranial venous pres-sure. 1, 2 Bilateral transverse sinus (TS) narrowing in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) can be found regularly on MR imaging and may cause venous outflow ob-struction. 3 Some patients benefit from stent treatment of these venous sinus obstructions, 4 but others do not. The role of a TS stenosis remains to be evaluated. 5 We present 3 patients with typical signs and symptoms of IIH in whom the reversibility and re-occurrence of venous sinus stenoses are emphasized...|$|E

In eight acutely anaesthetized fetal sheep, a 3 F tip pressure transducer (TP) was inserted from the external jugular into the umbilical vein (UV). Ultrasound Doppler flow velocities, TP position and <b>intravenous</b> <b>pressures</b> were recorded in the UV, ductus venosus (DV) and inferior vena cava (IVC) while the TP was withdrawn. Flow was steady in the UV but small pressure fluctuations (< 0. 4 mm Hg) could be detected.

40|$|Animal {{studies have}} shown that the {{increased}} <b>intravenous</b> <b>pressure</b> stimulates the group III and IV muscle afferent fibres, and in turn induce cardiovascular responses. However, this pathway of autonomic regulation has not been examined in humans. The aim of this study was to examine the hypothesis that infusion of saline into the venous circulation of an arterially occluded vascular bed evokes sympathetic activation in healthy individuals. Blood pressure, heart rate, and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) responses were assessed in 19 young healthy subjects during local infusion of 40 ml saline into a forearm vein in the circulatory arrested condition. From baseline (11. 8 ± 1. 2 bursts min− 1), MSNA increased significantly during the saline infusion (22. 5 ± 2. 6 bursts min− 1, P < 0. 001). Blood pressure also increased significantly during the saline infusion. Three control trials were performed during separate visits. The results from the control trial show that the observed MSNA and blood pressure responses were not due to muscle ischaemia. The present data show that saline infusion into the venous circulation of an arterially occluded vascular bed induces sympathetic activation and an increase in blood pressure. We speculate that the infusion under such conditions stimulates the afferent endings near the vessels, and evokes the sympathetic activation...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{demonstrate}} that abdominal pressure impacts venous flow and pressure characteristics. METHODS: Venous pressure at the femoral vein {{was measured in}} 6 non-obese subjects (mean BMI 22 ± 2 kg/m(2)) that were exposed to a circumferential cuff placed around the abdominal trunk and inflated to 20 and 40 mmHg. In a second step non-obese subjects (n = 10, BMI 21. 8 ± 1. 8 kg/m(2)) exposed to this cuff compression were studied for duplexsonographic parameters at the femoral vein. Duplexsonographic results were compared to subjects with abdominal obesity (n = 22, BMI 36. 2 ± 5. 9 kg/m(2)) in whom duplexsonographic parameters at the femoral vein were studied without cuff compression. RESULTS: <b>Intravenous</b> <b>pressure</b> increased with pressure application in all participants (p = 0. 0025). Duplex examination of 10 non-obese subjects revealed increasing venous diameter (p < 0. 0001) and decreasing venous peak and mean velocity (all p < 0. 0001) when cuff pressure was applied. Duplex parameters with cuff pressure application of 20 and 40 mmHg respectively, {{were similar to those}} in obese subjects that were studied without pressure application. CONCLUSIONS: External abdominal pressure application creates venous stasis in lower limbs.

40|$|Occlusion of the {{cerebral}} venous system is frequently associated with intraparenchymal or subarachnoid hemorrhage. There are few reports of cerebral venous thrombosis associated with nontraumatic {{chronic subdural hematoma}} (CSH). We aimed to evaluate the intracranial venous system in patients with spontaneous nontraumatic CSH and to identify alterations in their venous sinuses. In this study, eight patients with spontaneous, nontraumatic CSH were followed for a 7 -year period (mean: 2. 2 years, range: 1 - 7 years). Neuroradiological images were taken {{at the onset of}} symptoms and during follow-up. Venous angiography or magnetic resonance venography was used to evaluate {{the cerebral}} venous system of patients. In all patients, medical or surgical treatments were based on clinical symptoms. In seven of the eight patients, the CSH was in the left hemisphere, whereas one patient had bilateral CSH. In one of the eight patients, thrombosis of the transverse sinus and sigmoid sinus was found, but recanalization was observed at follow-up. In a further three patients, the superior sagittal sinus, the straight sinus, and the vein of Galen were markedly reduced in diameter compared to normal or were not visible at presentation, but normal flow was observed at follow-up. In the remaining four patients, the transverse sinus was not observed at symptom onset or during long-term follow-up. A nontraumatic CSH can occur secondary to a venous thrombosis or it can be associated with the inability to image some of the venous sinuses. Venous flow was restored at long-term follow-up.

Using a blunt-tip, multi-perforation cannula, the anaesthetic infiltration begins at the deep plane of the breast, and continues as the cannula is withdrawn towards the superficial plane of the breast.

40|$|Head-up tilt (HUT) induces a {{reduction}} in preload, which {{is thought to be}} restored through sympathetic venoconstriction, reducing unstressed volume (V(u)) and venous compliance (VeC). In this study, we assessed venous inflow and outflow responses and their reproducibility and determined the relation with autonomic function during HUT. Eight healthy non-pregnant women were subjected to 20 degrees head-down tilt to 60 degrees HUT at 20 degrees intervals. At each rotational step, we randomly assessed forearm pressure-volume (P-V) curves (venous occlusion plethysmography) during inflow (VeC(IN)) and outflow [venous emptying rate (VER(OUT)) ]. VeC(IN) was defined as the ratio of the slope of the volume-time curve and pressure-time curve, with direct <b>intravenous</b> <b>pressure</b> measurement. VER(OUT) was determined using the derivate of a quadratic regression model using cuff pressure. We defined V(u) as the y-intercept of the P-V curve. We calculated, for both methods, the coefficients of reproducibility (CR) and variation (CV). Vascular sympathetic activity was determined by spectral analysis. VeC(IN) decreased at each rotational step compared with the supine position (P< 0. 05), whereas VER(OUT) increased. CR of VeC(IN) was higher in the supine position than VER(OUT) but lower during HUT. CV varied between 19 % and 25 % (VeC(IN)) and between 12 % and 21 % (VER(OUT)). HUT decreased V(u). The change in VeC(IN) and VER(OUT) correlated with the change in vascular sympathetic activity (r= - 0. 36, P< 0. 01, and r= 0. 48, P< 0. 01). This is the first study in which a reproducible reduction in VeC(IN) and V(u) and a rise in VER(OUT) during HUT are documented.

40|$|While {{auricular}} fibrillation {{is easily}} recognized by arterial and jugular tracings or by electrocardiograms, {{it is not}} possible to interpret all the waves found in these records. The venous tracings may in general be placed in one of two classes: (a) those in which prominent systolic waves predominate or occur alone; and (b) those in which large or small diastolic waves occur occasionally, in groups, or in a continued series averaging 250 to 500 per minute. The prominent systolic waves have generally been attributed to tricuspid regurgitation, the inference being that tricuspid regurgitation is a common state in auricular fibrillation. The diastolic waves are so numerous and so many electrocardiograms show diastolic waves that it is impossible to account for them on the assumption that the auricle is in a dilated and finely fibrillating state. It has been suggested that in these instances a condition of coarse fibrillation, which is closely allied to auricular flutter, obtains. The systolic and diastolic waves of the venous pulse of twenty-five clinical cases of auricular fibrillation, recorded by photographic methods, were studied. Six types of systolic waves (Text-Fig. 1) were found: (1) an intensified impact wave, the most common and often the only characteristic feature, indicating vigorous ventricular action; (2) a peaked impact followed by a rapid systolic drop due to light pressure of the tambour; (3) the intra-auricular type of systolic variation, so called from its resemblance to intra-auricular pressure curves found in animals, occurring in clinical cases only when ventricular systole is weak; (4) double systolic waves, attributed to a systolic tug of the ventricle on the auricles and large veins; (5) a systolic impact followed by a stasis wave, present when <b>intravenous</b> <b>pressure</b> is high; (6) a regurgitation wave composed of a steep rise continued into a systolic plateau with murmur vibrations superimposed. Our study showed (1) that tricuspid regurgitation, as indicated by the presence of regurgitation waves, is a rare accompaniment of auricular fibrillation; and (2) that the contrary opinion, arrived at by the frequent presence in polygraph tracings of ventricular types of waves, is due to the fact that the contour of intensified impact waves is distorted by polygraph levers so that they simulate regurgitation waves. Recurrent diastolic waves were frequently present in our records. Their relative size depended, to a considerable extent, on the pressure of the tambour. There was no constant relation to similar waves in the recorded electrocardiogram, nor is it proven that they are indicative of a coarse type of fibrillation or an associated flutter...|$|E

Patients with pulmonary valve atresia, those who received prostaglandin during hospital admission, and those who underwent prior shunt palliation were excluded. ResultsA total of 4698 patients met our inclusion criteria, of whom 202 were younger than 30 days old (group A), 861 were 31 to 90 days old (group B), 1796 were 91 to 180 days old (group C), and 1839 were older than 180 days (group D). In-hospital mortality, intensive care unit length of stay, and total hospital length of stay were significantly higher in group A.

Significant institutional variability was noted for timing of TOF complete repair, with one third of the centers performing 75 % of the repairs at younger than 30 days old. The institutional approach to timing TOF complete repair showed no relation to surgical volume.

40|$|The major {{therapeutic}} {{approach to}} systemic and pulmonary hypertension and vasospasm in cardiac surgery patients {{involves the use}} of parenteral agents that reverse systemic vasoconstriction and produce vasodilation.

Of the currently available intravenous vasoactive therapies, the mainstay agents are the nitrovasodilators and the dihydropyridine-type calcium channel blockers. The nitrovasodilators, a diverse group of drugs that achieve vascular relaxation by stimulating cyclic nucleotides and thereby releasing nitric oxide, include nitroglycerin and sodium nitroprusside.

We {{performed}} {{experiments in}} a-chloralose-anesthetized rabbits with vagi sectioned, {{to determine the}} influence of intravenous and intracerebroventricular vasopressin on arterial baroreflex control of renal nerve activity. Arterial baroreflex control of renal nerve activity was assessed during phenylephrine-induced increases and nitroglycerin-induced decreases in arterial <b>pressure.</b> <b>Intravenous</b> vasopressin (4 and 40 mU over 1 minute) reduced basal renal nerve activity (from 149 ± 14 to 101 ± 13 and 28 ± 13 impulses/sec) without changing arterial pressure and reduced the sensitivity of the arterial baroreflex control of renal nerve activity. This effect was reversed by vasopressin antagonist (d(CH 2) 5 [Tyr(Me) : 2]AVP) which blocks vasoconstrictor effects of vasopressin. Intracerebroventricular vasopressin (4, 40, or 400 mU) did not alter basal renal nerve activity or arterial pressure but increased the sensitivity of baroreflex control of renal nerve activity. This effect was not blocked by the vasopressin antagonist. The influence of intravenous vasopressin on basal renal nerve activity was not altered by sinoaortic baroreceptor denervation. In contrast, the inhibitory influence of intravenous vasopressin on lumbar sympathetic nerve activity was abolished by sinoaortic denervation.

We tested 11 analogues of amiloride, 3 other diuretics, and a hypotensive imidazopyrazine for vasodilator activity in the dog forelimb and found one analogue, 6 -iodo-amilo-ride, with twice the activity of amiloride. Intravenous injection of 3 mg of 6 -iodo-amiloride promptly decreased systemic arterial pressure and forelimb perfusion pressure 65 and 47 mm Hg respectively. The decreases with 3 mg of amiloride were only 5 and 23 mm Hg respectively. Intravenous infusion of 17 to 77 mg of 6 -iodo-amiloride produced diuresis, natriuresis, and antikaliuresis and, with the higher doses, hypotension. The latter occurred promptly on starting the infusion and was sustained {{for the duration of}} the infusion. Wistar rats responded to an intravenous infusion of 0. 38 mg/ 100 g in 11 minutes in the same manner. In the spontaneously hypertensive rat, this same dose produced a large, sustained antihypertensive effect with little change in the urinary parameters.

40|$|The project {{involve the}} {{research}} and development of a pulsatile, complex or continuous flow in biological and non-biological systems implantable heart assist pump. Specifically as a 20 % cardiac assist for persons from congestive heart failure and other cardiac abnormalities. The pulsatile cardiac assist pump would provide upto 20 % of the blood pumping process from the venous supply to the arterial supply. Current pumps are largely complete bypass pumps or large volume pumps that produce significant long term blood cell damage resulting in thrombosis. Most are not pulsatile which offers a significant physiological advantage. The pump under development is designed to prevent thrombosis by utilizing a unique geometry and pumping actuation mechanism. As part of the research we first used COSMOL simulation to aid in the design and blood flow dynamics. From these results we have designed a working prototype that can be configured in a number of geometries or stages. This design utilizes biocompatible material, Polyethylene oxide (PEO), which minimized protein interaction with the interior pumping surface. Shape memory alloy actuators compress the pumping chamber. Shape memory alloy actuators also actuate compression of the ingoing sphincter valve and outgoing sphincter valves. Pumping motion can be analyzed by accelerometers to provide optimized feedback and pump motion control. Zoned compression may allow optimal compression for blood flow. This type of pumping system biomimics actual heart compression and pulsation while the sphincter like valves minimizes thrombosis causing turbulent. A second actuation method may be employed utilizing pneumatic cuffs that inflate and compress the pump body and sphincter valves. The pump has a minimum of one hundred twenty mmHg pressure capabilities at fifty to one hundred and fifty beats per minute or in coordination with the compression and decompression rate of the heart as measured by blood pressure sensors or direct heart electro cardiac sensing. A cluster of pumps each independently controlled may be packaged for sequence or sequential actuation providing complex pumping and flow patterns or continuous pumping flow. Further the pumps may be independently actuated in a tandem configuration. As such the pump provides a broad field of use including but not limited to arterial to arterial pumping, drug delivery, physiological fluidic maintenance, <b>intravenous</b> delivery, <b>pressure</b> maintenance and drug manufacturing where low turbulence flow is required and any pulsatile, complex flow pattern or continuous flow pattern is required...|$|R

40|$|Abstract AIM: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of sedation with benzodiazepines in a large population of patients undergoing oral surgery and age-related implications. METHODS: A group of 1 179 consecutive patients undergoing oral surgery in the Dental Clinic of the University of Padua between 2001 and 2003 was evaluated by analysing their anaesthesiological records. The patients were divided into 5 age groups. All were pre-sedated with chlordemethyldiazepam per os, while induction of maximum subjective tranquillity was obtained with fractionated doses of <b>intravenous</b> diazepam. Arterial <b>pressure</b> (AP), heart rate (HR), anxiety level, pathologies, drugs taken, types of intervention, techniques of loco-regional anaesthesia, immediately preoperative AP and HR and tranquillity, intraoperative AP and HR, data regarding postoperative psychomotor recovery, complications and drugs used for the treatment of perioperative pain, were evaluated in each group. RESULTS: Most of the patients (679) were in the 45 - 64 year-old group. Cardiovascular, respiratory and digestive pathologies proved to be age-dependent. Control AP and HR respectively increased and decreased with age. The doses of chlordemethyldiazepam used induced age-dependent preoperative tranquillity levels. The doses of i. v. diazepam necessary to obtain maximal preoperative subjective tranquillity fell as a function of age. The AP and HR values respectively increased during intervention and decreased in the first hour of intervention. Normal psychomotor recovery was less evident in older patients. The most significant corrective intraoperative interventions consisted of the administration of sublingual hypotensive drugs and in the immediate treatment of some cases of orthostatic hypotension and vaso-vagal syncope. CONCLUSIONS: The sedation technique and the antistress procedures employed proved safe and the intra- or postoperative complications almost non-existent. The variations observed in the parameters considered are compatible with the greater age of the treated subjects. PMID: 16224375 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE...|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} made of the effects of 5 -carboxamidotryptamine (5 -CT) on pressor {{responses}} induced in vivo by electrical stimulation of the sympathetic outflow from the spinal cord of pithed rats. All animals had been pretreated with atropine.

In the present study we characterized the pharmacological profile of the receptors mediating the above inhibitory effect of 5 -CT. The inhibition induced by 0. 01 [*]μg[*]kg− 1 [*]min− 1 of 5 -CT on sympathetically-induced pressor responses was partially blocked after i. v. treatment with methiothepin (10 [*][*]μg[*]kg− 1), WAY- 100, 635 (100 [*]μg[*]kg− 1) or GR 127935 T (250 [*]μg[*]kg− 1), but was not affected by cyanopindolol (100 [*]μg[*]kg− 1). The selective 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist 8 -OH-DPAT and the selective 5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D receptor agonists sumatriptan and L- 694, 247 inhibited the pressor response, whereas the 5 -HT 1 B receptor agonists CGS- 12066 B and CP- 93, 129 and the 5 -HT 2 C receptor agonist m-CPP did not modify the pressor symapthetic responses. The selective 5 -HT 1 A receptor antagonist WAY- 100, 635 (100 [*]μg[*]kg− 1) blocked the inhibition induced by 8 -OH-DPAT and the selective 5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D receptor antagonist GR 127935 T (250 [*]μg[*]kg− 1) abolished the inhibition induced either by L- 694, 247 or sumatriptan. None of the 5 -HT receptor agonists used in our experiments modified the pressor responses induced by exogenous noradrenaline (NA).

Although nimodipine (NM) is widely used to treat cerebral vasospasm in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, trials exploring its antihypertensive effect after intravenous administration in subjects with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) are scarce. Methods: A retrospective study was carried out to compare the safety and efficacy of NC and NM administered intravenously in patients with ICH. Therapeutic responses were assessed by achievement of goal blood pressure (BP); use of additional medications for BP control; proportion of time spent within goal; variability in BP; time to goal BP; number of dose adjustments; variability in ICH volume, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and intracranial pressure; and drug-related complications. Results: A total of 87 patients were eligible for analysis (n= 46 [NC]; n= 41 [NM]), and baseline characteristics between groups were similar. Both agents were effective in achieving goal BP during infusion, with 93. 5 % and 87. 8 % patients in the NC and NM groups achieving goal, respectively. Fewer additional medications were needed to control BP in the NC group. BP variability was similar and no differences were observed in the mean time to goal BP and mean numbers of dose adjustments between both groups. Interestingly, intracranial pressure declined (P= 0. 048) during NC administration but increased (P= 0. 066) after NM treatment. Finally, the incidences of hematoma expansion, neurological deterioration, and adverse drug events were similar in both groups.

40|$|The {{transient}} receptor potential (TRP) melastin 8 {{ion channel}} (TRPM 8) is implicated in bladder sensing but limited information on TRPM 8 antagonists in bladder overactivity (BO) is available. This study characterizes a new TRPM 8 -selective antagonist (DFL 23448) and evaluates it in cold-induced behavioral tests and on bladder function and experimental BO in vivo in rats. DFL 23448 displayed IC 50 values of 10 and 21 nM in hTRPM 8 HEK- 293 cells activated by Cooling Agent 10 or cold, but had limited activity (IC 50 > 10 μM) at TRPV 1, TRPA 1, TRPV 4, or at various G-protein-coupled receptors. In rats, DFL 23448 had a half-life of 37 minutes (intravenous; i. v.) or 4. 9 hours (oral). DLF 23448 (10 mg/kg, i. v) reduced icilin-induced wet-dog shakes in rats. Intravesical (i. ves.) DFL 23448 (10 mg/L) but not vehicle increased micturition intervals (MI), micturition volumes (MV) and bladder capacity (BC). During BO by i. ves.
