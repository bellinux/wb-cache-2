5|$|By {{the end of}} 1874, Smetana {{had become}} {{completely}} deaf but, freed from his theatre duties and the related controversies, he began a period of sustained composition that continued for almost {{the rest of his}} life. His contributions to Czech music were increasingly recognised and honoured, but a mental collapse early in 1884 led to his incarceration in an asylum and subsequent death. Smetana's reputation as the founding father of Czech music <b>has</b> <b>endured</b> in his native country, where advocates have raised his status above that of his contemporaries and successors. However, relatively few of Smetana's works are in the international repertory, and most foreign commentators tend to regard Antonín Dvořák as a more significant Czech composer.|$|E
5|$|Rupert is {{probably}} best remembered today {{for his role as}} a Royalist commander during the English Civil War. He had considerable success during the initial years of the war, his drive, determination and experience of European techniques bringing him early victories. As the war progressed, Rupert's youth and lack of maturity in managing his relationships with other Royalist commanders ultimately resulted in his removal from his post and ultimate retirement from the war. Throughout the conflict, however, Rupert also enjoyed a powerful symbolic position: he was an iconic Royalist Cavalier and as such was frequently the subject of both Parliamentarian and Royalist propaganda, an image which <b>has</b> <b>endured</b> over the years.|$|E
5|$|Stanford {{composed}} {{a substantial number}} of concert works, including seven symphonies, but his best-remembered pieces are his choral works for church performance, chiefly composed in the Anglican tradition. He was a dedicated composer of opera, but none of his nine completed operas <b>has</b> <b>endured</b> in the general repertory. Some critics regarded Stanford, together with Hubert Parry and Alexander Mackenzie, as responsible for a renaissance in music from the British Isles. However, after his conspicuous success as a composer {{in the last two decades}} of the 19th century, his music was eclipsed in the 20th century by that of Edward Elgar as well as former pupils.|$|E

5|$|Diaby {{is often}} {{described}} as being injury-prone. Since returning from his fractured ankle injury in late 2006, the midfielder <b>has</b> <b>endured</b> persistent niggling injuries that have resulted in Diaby failing to play a full season for his current club. During his second season at Auxerre, a season in which he was expected to get some significant playing time, Diaby failed to gain the confidence of manager Jacques Santini primarily due to repetitive injuries he endured during the Autumn portion of the 2005–06 season. After returning to the team, Diaby struggled to return to form, which ultimately resulted in his sale to Arsenal. His highest output for appearances with Arsenal came in the 2009–10 season when he played in 40 matches. Arsenal played a total of 55 competitive matches in the season.|$|E
5|$|Many populations, {{particularly}} in the Sydney region, inhabit areas of infrequent disturbance, such as golf courses, disused industrial land, brick pits, and landfill areas. Though {{once one of the}} most common frogs in south-east Australia, the green and golden bell frog <b>has</b> <b>endured</b> major population declines, {{particularly in}} highland areas, leading to its current classification as globally vulnerable. Its numbers have continued to fall and are threatened by habitat loss and degradation, pollution, introduced species, and parasites and pathogens, including the chytrid Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. As most of the remaining populations live on private land, the logistics of the conservation effort can be complicated. Despite the situation in Australia, some frog populations have survived with more success in New Zealand and several other Pacific islands, where it has been introduced. However, unfortunately even in these areas the population of green and golden bell has been rapidly declining in the past few decades.|$|E
