25|$|The {{seasonal}} frosting and <b>defrosting</b> of {{the southern}} ice cap results {{in the formation of}} spider-like radial channels carved on 1 meter thick ice by sunlight. Then, sublimed CO2 – and probably water – increase pressure in their interior producing geyser-like eruptions of cold fluids often mixed with dark basaltic sand or mud.

Rest crates are often mentioned as an archetypal application of modern sorcery, based on a spell used by the ancient Kaunian Empire to paralyze enemy soldiers.

The rest crate, therefore, operates by slowing down the passage of time within its volume while its lid is shut. Food placed within it does not decay at a noticeable rate, but also requires no <b>defrosting</b> or other preparation before being used. A variant on this technique is also used by medical mages, who can slow down people suffering from serious injury in order to give them time to perform surgery, or to transport the victim to a place of treatment.|$|E

40|$|Minimization {{of frost}} {{formation}} on the outdoor coils of residential heat pumps and subsequent <b>defrost</b> cycles {{to remove the}} frost in an energy efficient manner remains an active area {{of research and development}} in the HVAC industry. Inverting the cycle to reject heat from the outdoor coils is the most common method to run <b>defrost</b> cycles of the residential heat pumps. However, these <b>defrost</b> cycles are energy intensive. This research proposes a novel method that can substantially reduce the energy consumed in such <b>defrost</b> cycles. The method involves controlled use of reverse air flow on the outdoor coil surface during the <b>defrost</b> cycle, resulting in fewer <b>defrost</b> cycles needed for a given duration of heat pump operation. The method further provides better cleaning of the coil surface by improving the draining of the melted frost. It also allows part of the frost to be removed without the need to melt it. In this research, the proposed methods are evaluated experimentally by simulating the frost formation, and <b>defrost</b> cycle in a controlled environment. <b>Defrost</b> cycles were run with two of the most popular control strategies that are in use, time-based <b>defrost</b> and control-based <b>defrost.</b> Experimental results demonstrate that {{with the use of the}} proposed method, energy savings of 56 % and 31 % are possible for the above- and below-freezing environments respectively, as compared to a baseline that represents the ASHRAE recommended operating conditions...|$|R

40|$|Frost {{accumulation}} on evaporator coils {{has been}} a serious problem that decreases the efficiency of refrigeration systems. Many <b>defrost</b> methods have been used and hot gas <b>defrost</b> {{is the most common}} for industrial refrigeration applications. However, it is not a simple task to run an efficient hot gas <b>defrost</b> system. The duration and frequency of the <b>defrost</b> cycle should be properly determined so that the frost is melted but no additional heat transfer is transferred to the refrigerated space. An experimental investigation was conducted at the Classic Salads Facility in Salinas, California. A single coil was instrumented to study frost build up and <b>defrost</b> during normal operation. The finite difference method is used to numerically model the temperature of the coil during a <b>defrost</b> cycle. A separate model was developed to determine the pressure drop across evaporator coil with and without frost. Both models are used to determine the presence of frost on the coil tested at Classic Salads. The pressure drop data did not show an increase in the pressure drop over time, indicating there was no frost accumulation during testing at Classic Salads. Also, comparison between the finite difference model and the experimental temperature data indicate that there was minimal frost.

2500|$|Geothermal {{heat pumps}} or ground-source heat pumps use shallow {{underground}} heat exchangers as a heat source or sink, and water as the heat transfer medium.

Ground source heat pumps work {{in the same way as}} air-source heat pumps, but exchange heat with the ground via water pumped through pipes in the ground. Ground source heat pumps are more simple and therefore more reliable than air source heat pumps as they do not need fan or <b>defrosting</b> systems and can be housed inside. Although a ground heat exchanger requires a higher initial capital cost, the annual running costs are lower, because well-designed ground source heat pump systems operate more efficiently because they start with a warmer source temperature than the air in winter.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a mathematical model}} of the <b>defrost</b> process for a finned-tube air chiller, utilised as a heat exchanger in a secondary loop multi-temperature transport refrigeration system, where an antifreeze mixture is deployed as a sensible secondary working fluid. Two <b>defrost</b> modes are modeled: an electric mode which effects <b>defrost</b> by localised resistance heating of the chiller secondary working fluid, and a hot gas primary circuit mode that indirectly heats the secondary working fluid {{by means of a}} primary to secondary heat exchanger. The model, which was implemented using the Engineering Equation Solver (EES), is based on a finite difference approach to analyse the heat transfer from the secondary working fluid, through a single finned heat exchanger section, to the frost. An iterative scheme is used to integrate for the overall heat exchanger, taking into account temperature glide associated with the secondary working fluid. The overall heat exchanger model is incorporated within a system <b>defrost</b> model, which allows the entire <b>defrost</b> process to be modeled. The model was validated for the standard United Nations Agreement on Transportation of Perishable Produce (ATP) for cold room set-points of 0 oC, - 10 oC and - 20 oC, by comparison with experimental data from a full scale laboratory based test programme. The validated model is used to carry out <b>defrost</b> sensitivity studies which examine <b>defrost</b> behavior for a range of performance parameters...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. January 2017. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisor: Francis Kulacki. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xii, 144 pages. Frost formation and anti-icing methods are studied {{in a variety}} of areas for decades. In refrigeration systems, a number of studies are focused on the influence of surface treatment on delaying the time of frost formation. There are far fewer studies on the effect of surface wettability on the <b>defrost</b> process. Some of the literature show experimental results on <b>defrost</b> time for different surfaces, but the results could be different based on individual experimental conditions. In this study, the influences of surface wettability on the <b>defrost</b> process are investigated analytically. The melting process is divided into three stages based on the behaviors of the meltwater. The water saturation and meltwater draining velocity are formulated for absorption and drainage stages separately. The comparison among the melting rate, the permeation rate, and the draining velocity determines the meltwater behavior, which influences the <b>defrost</b> process and <b>defrost</b> mechanisms. The slumping condition is a special phenomenon in the melting process and can be a potential method for frost removal. Water accumulation at the surface decreases the adherence strength of the frost column to the surface. A slumping criterion is formulated based on the analysis of interfacial forces and the body force on the frost column. The slumping condition of the model depends on the contact angle on hydrophilic surfaces and on the contact angle hysteresis on hydrophobic surfaces. Experiments of frost and <b>defrost</b> process on vertical surfaces with different wetting conditions are conducted on a lab-build setup. The experimental results show that <b>defrost</b> time and efficiency are determined by the system design, the heating methods, the heat flux applied at the surface and the surface wettability. <b>Defrost</b> mechanisms vary with surface wettability. During the <b>defrost</b> process, a frost column detaches from a superhydrophobic surface and falls off as a whole piece. While on the superhydrophilic and plain surfaces, frost melts, and water film or retention evaporates. <b>Defrost</b> time and efficiency are not significantly different on the tested surfaces at the point that frost melts and water film/retention droplets remain on the surfaces. However, <b>defrost</b> time and efficiency are improved noticeably on the superhyrophobic surface for a complete <b>defrost</b> process in which the water evaporation time is included. This research serves as a supplement to current studies on the effect of surface wettability in refrigeration systems. In application, the preference to the different surface wettability depends on the practical operation requirements and the actual system design...|$|R
40|$|Today, {{transport}} refrigeration systems form {{a crucial}} part of the “ Cold Chain” transporting fresh and frozen produce from refrigerated warehouses to wholesalers. When these systems operate with compartment set-point temperatures of 0 °C or below frost forms {{on the surface of the}} evaporator coil due to the presence of moisture in the air. This moisture may result from air infiltration due to door openings or produce transpiration. As frost forms on the evaporator coil the free airflow space between the evaporator fins decreases, ultimately reducing the refrigerating capacity o f the system. <b>Defrost</b> cycles are periodically required to remove this frost to maintain system performance. This is typically accomplished by supplying high-pressure hot gas refrigerant directly from the compressor discharge to the evaporator coil on transport refrigeration systems and is referred to as “hot gas defrost”.
