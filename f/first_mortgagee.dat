50|$|The term “bill of sale” {{originally}} {{referred to}} any writing by which an absolute disposition of personalty for value was effected or evidenced. A common feature of such dispositions {{is that the}} owner mortgagor remains in possession and exercises all the attendant rights of ownership, which may be so overwhelming as to induce a third party to accept the same chattel as a security for a grant, albeit without notice of the <b>first</b> <b>mortgagee.</b> This scenario made the bill of sale a veritable tool of fraud.|$|E
2500|$|The rule {{is only a}} {{presumption}} of convenience, but in practice {{it is difficult to}} displace, and can have a devastating effect on the security rights of <b>first</b> <b>mortgagees.</b> For example, suppose a customer secures an overdraft with a mortgage against their house. [...] Then {{at a time when the}} overdraft stands at £100,000, the customer grants a second mortgage over their house as security for a term loan to another bank. [...] If over the following nine months, the customer was to pay £90,000 into the account and draw a further £70,000 out of the account, the amount owed to the first bank would be reduced to only £80,000, but they would only have first ranking security for a mere £10,000. [...] For the remaining £70,000 they would rank behind the second mortgagee.|$|R

5000|$|The {{mortgagee}} has {{the right}} to foreclose. <b>First,</b> the <b>mortgagee</b> obtains judgment specifically declaring the immovable property executable. Then, the mortgagee, as judgment creditor, issues a writ of execution against the mortgaged property, instructing the sheriff to levy the execution immediately. There are several constitutional implications, especially in terms of the right of access to adequate housing.|$|R
50|$|More specifically, gap {{financing}} is subordinated temporary financing paid {{off when the}} <b>first</b> <b>mortgagee</b> disburses the full amount due under the first mortgage loan. This is normal in a situation involving a permanent “floor-ceiling loan,” where the borrower does not meet a rent-roll requirement, and the <b>first</b> <b>mortgagee</b> funds only a floor amount, agreeing to fund the balance in the event the rent-roll requirement is met within a stated period. In this case, the gap lender is often the construction lender. Where the gap lender has agreed prior to construction to make the gap loan, the document that ties together the construction loan, the gap loan, and the permanent loan is the buy-sell agreement. In this agreement, a special provision is inserted providing that if the permanent lender's rent-roll holdback is not fulfilled at {{the time for the}} permanent closing, the construction lender agrees to disburse, at a concurrent closing date, funds equal to the amount withheld by the permanent lender pursuant to its commitment. These gap funds are normally evidenced by a promissory note secured by a junior mortgage subject and subordinate in all respects to the permanent loan documentation. The gap documents usually state unequivocally that, in the event the rent-roll requirement is not met during the rent-roll period, the permanent lender still retains the right on demand to purchase the gap note and discharge of record any second mortgage held by the construction lender. The borrower normally assigns to the construction lender all funds that would otherwise be payable to the borrower in the event the rent-roll requirement is met, with the construction lender agreeing to reassign to the borrower all funds that would be payable pursuant to the rent-roll requirement at such time as the gap loan note is paid in full. In addition, the permanent lender usually requires that the temporary lender and borrower agree that no funds will be disbursed under the gap documents, except at the closing of the permanent loan.|$|E
50|$|Money lenders have {{extensive}} rights from common law and statute. A <b>mortgagee's</b> <b>first</b> right is to repayment of the debt, {{but if the}} borrower's circumstances mean this is impossible, a process of taking possession of the mortgaged property and selling it usually begins. Almost every step, however, is mediated through court.|$|R
50|$|When a mortgaged {{tract of}} land is split up and sold, upon default, the <b>mortgagee</b> <b>first</b> forecloses on lands still owned by the {{mortgagor}} and proceeds against other owners in an 'inverse order' {{in which they were}} sold. For example, Alice acquires a 3 acre lot by mortgage then splits up the lot into three 1 acre lots (X, Y, and Z), and sells lot Y to Bob, and then lot Z to Charlie, retaining lot X for herself. Upon default, the mortgagee proceeds against lot X first, the mortgagor. If foreclosure or repossession of lot X does not fully satisfy the debt, the mortgagee proceeds against lot Y (Bob), then lot Z (Charlie). The rationale is that the first purchaser should have more equity and subsequent purchasers receive a diluted share.|$|R
5000|$|Deed of TrustOn 14 October 1896, the {{day before}} Florence got married, Charles A. V. Conybeare placed those [...] "various properties" [...] {{including}} the Tregullow Offices (known together as [...] "the estate") in trust—which properties were still subject to a mortgage—to Henry Grant Madan Conybeare (Charles's brother and JP) and merchant banker Isaac Seligman. As a result, Henry Conybeare and Isaac Seligman became the legal owners and trustees of the estate. This construction enabled Charles Conybeare to confer financial benefits to Florence Conybeare, so that when parts of the estate were sold, she would be entitled to {{a share of the}} proceeds. The Deed of Trust that was drawn up to make this possible, recognised four interested parties:1. Charles A.V. Conybeare (husband and trustor).2. Jacob Luard Pattisson (civil servant), James Jollie Pattisson (teacher) and Bixby Garnham Luard (vicar and uncle to the <b>first</b> two): the <b>mortgagees</b> (read: moneylenders).3. Charles A.V. Conybeare and Florence Annie Conybeare (beneficial owners).4. Isaac Seligman and Henry Grant Madan Conybeare (legal owners and trustees).|$|R
5000|$|Money lenders have {{extensive}} rights from common law and statute. A <b>mortgagee's</b> <b>first</b> right is to repayment of the debt, {{but if the}} borrower's circumstances mean this is impossible, a process of taking possession of the mortgaged property and selling it usually begins. Almost every step, however, is mediated through court. The Administration of Justice Act 1970 section 36 says that the court may adjourn proceedings if the [...] "mortgagor {{is likely to be}} able within a reasonable period to pay any sums due under the mortgage", and the Consumer Credit Act 1974 sections 129-130 does the same for second mortgages. In an anomalous case, Ropaigealach v Barclays Bank plc a bank had auctioned off a (second) house the owning a family was away. Clarke LJ felt unable to apply the AJA 1970, because properly construed, it was only able to halt proceedings when legal proceedings had in fact been launched, and here there were none. In a more borrower-friendly decision, Cheltenham & Gloucester Building Society v Norgan Waite LJ gave guidance that in ordering a plan for repayment, a judge should give [...] "the period most favourable to the mortgagor at the outset", so that repeated applications to court on continuing defaults could be avoided, and so that [...] "the mortgagee can be heard with justice to say that the mortgagor has had his chance". When it comes to a sale, Law of Property Act 1925 sections 101 and 103 require that the provision for sale must have been in the mortgage deed, that three months notice and space must be given. Section 88 confirms that a buyer after a sale receives an unencumbered title. In the sale process itself, there is a duty of care. In Cuckmere Brick Co v Mutual Finance Mutual Finance auctioned Cuckmere Brick Co's property after it had defaulted on a loan, but failed to advertise that the property had secured planning permission for building more flats. Salmon LJ emphasised that because the borrower will still be liable for sums on a loan if a house is undersold, because the [...] "mortgagor is vitally affected by the result of the sale", an obligation is owed to get [...] "the true market value." [...] Moreover, a higher duty of scrutiny will be imposed if a mortgagee sells to a related party. In Tse Kwong Lam v Wong Chit Sen Mr Wong sold property taken from Mr Tse to his wife, after not advertising the auction. The Privy Council advised that while delay in the claim meant the sale should not be set aside, damages could be awarded because of the significant conflict of interest. Lord Templeman emphasised that [...] "a heavy onus lies on the mortgagee to show that in all respects he acted fairly" [...] so the transaction is perfectly fair and equal.|$|R
