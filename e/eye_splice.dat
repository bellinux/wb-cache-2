50|$|Surviving nooses in the UK show simple slipknots {{that were}} {{superseded}} {{in the late}} 19th century with a metal <b>eye</b> <b>spliced</b> into {{one end of the}} rope, the noose being formed by passing the other end through it. The classic hangman's knot was largely developed in the USA, the heavy mass of the knot intended to crush blood vessels in the neck and if tightened beneath the jaw, to lever the head to one side. Filmed hangings of war criminals in Europe after World War 2, conducted under US jurisdiction, show such knots placed in various places, including {{at the back of the}} neck.|$|R
5000|$|Logs are {{typically}} cut into appropriate lengths using a chainsaw, then the [...] "ringers" [...] or cuts are split with an axe into cubes which are {{small enough to}} handle, usually 100 to 450 pounds, then stacked on a rope. The rope is looped around the stacked wood and the ends passed through an <b>eye</b> <b>spliced</b> in the end. When the running end is pulled it tightens the [...] "sling" [...] rope around the blocks preventing them from falling out. The slings are then flown to a central location {{where they can be}} loaded on pallets for transport. Previously, swede saws, crosscut saws and hand saws may have been used to cut the logs, and a froe (a heavy blade 24 inches long and three inches wide with a handle at one end perpendicular to the blade) was used to split the ringers. This blade was driven into the wood using a mallet, then the wood could be pried apart by pulling on the handle if it would not split by driving the blade in alone.|$|R

The marine renewable energy (MRE) sector is now at a stage in its development whereby floating devices are adding new challenges to the moorings industries. Floating MRE devices are smaller than, for instance offshore platforms, and are usually targeted for deployment in highly energetic environments. The extreme conditions and the highly dynamic response of an MRE device present challenges in terms of peak loading within the mooring system itself and load transfer to the floating body. Compliant mooring systems provide advantages by reducing the peak loads and fibre ropes are an important asset in achieving such compliance. However, {{the extent to which}} existing fibre ropes can safely extend axially to provide compliance is insufficient and is strongly associated to the minimum breaking load (MBL) of the rope. A novel fibre rope mooring tether is presented here that provides advantages over existing ropes. The tether employs a hollow fibre rope containing an elastomeric core, this mechanism de-coupling the extension properties from the strength of the line. The load path is carried through the polyester rope which is terminated conventionally by <b>eye</b> <b>splices,</b> thus minimising any new risks to reliability. Very low axial stiffness is achieved and is shown to be selectable within limits. For comparison, the prototype tether’s MBL of 222 kN is assigned to polyester and Nylon reference ropes. The axial stiifness of these ropes are 590 kN and 463 kN respectively when measured by a secant between the origin and 30...|$|R

50|$|The best rope for warps is nylon {{which is}} strong and flexible. Terylene (polyester) is {{stronger}} but has less flex. Both ropes sink, so they avoid fouling other craft in crowded anchorages and do not absorb much water. Neither breaks down quickly in sunlight. Polypropylene or polythene are not suited to warps as they float and are much weaker than nylon and only slightly stronger than natural fibres. They break down in sunlight. Natural fibres such as manila or hemp are still used in developing nations but absorb much water, are relatively weak and rot. They do give good grip and are often very cheap. All anchors should have chain at least equal to the boat's length. Some skippers prefer an all chain warp for added security in coral waters. Boats less than 8 m typically use 6 mm galvanized chain. 8-14 m craft use 9 mm chain and over 14 m use 12 mm chain. The chain should be shackled to the warp through a steel <b>eye</b> or <b>spliced</b> to the chain using a chain splice. The shackle pin should be securely wired. Either galvanized or stainless steel is suitable for eyes and shackles.|$|R

5000|$|An <b>eye</b> <b>splice</b> {{may be used}} to {{terminate}} the loose end of a wire rope when forming a loop. The strands of the end of a wire rope are unwound a certain distance, and plaited back into the wire rope, forming the loop, or an eye, called an <b>eye</b> <b>splice.</b> When this type of rope splice is used specifically on wire rope, it is called a [...] "Molly Hogan", and, by some, a [...] "Dutch" [...] eye instead of a [...] "Flemish" [...] eye.|$|E

40|$|Tonicity-responsive {{enhancer}} binding protein (TonEBP) -nuclear {{factor of}} activated T cell family 5 is a DNA binding protein that {{plays a key}} role in the response of cells to hypertonicity. However, TonEBP is expressed and active in tissues that are in an isotonic milieu. To explore the biological role of TonEBP, we cloned mouse TonEBP that shares 92 % of amino acids with the human counterpart. TonEBP is expressed in embryonic stem cells and throughout the stages of fetal development. Immunohistochemical analysis shows expression of TonEBP in most, if not all, developing tissues, including the brain, colon, heart, muscle, and <b>eyes.</b> Widespread alternative <b>splicing</b> in exons 2 - 4 was detected throughout development and in different adult tissues. As a result, four different polypeptides are produced with different lengths at the NH(2) terminus. Two of the isoforms differ in their ability to stimulate transcription. In conclusion, the presence of TonEBP mRNA during mouse embryogenesis suggests that TonEBP functions at all stages of mouse development, as well as in isotonic adult tissues. close 424...|$|R
50|$|For ropes with {{a core of}} {{high-performance}} fibers (such as aramid fibers or Dyneema or Vectran) {{only the}} core determines the strength. The cover can be used optionally in the <b>eye</b> <b>splice,</b> for example, to add UV protection (for aramid fibers, such as Kevlar). Dyneema is very UV resistant and the cover is not needed. For these ropes, one could make an <b>eye</b> <b>splice</b> in the single braided core and leave the cover unused. There are ropes with an extra double layer cover; this is basically the same splice as for double braided except that the inner cover first needs to be removed over {{the length of the}} splice.|$|E

5000|$|... cut splice (originally called cunt splice) - A splice {{similar to}} the <b>eye</b> <b>splice.</b> It is {{typically}} used for light lines (e.g., the log-line) where a single splice would tend to come undone, the rope being frequently wet. [...] It makes a very strong knot. A cut splice is a join between two ropes, made by side splicing the ends slightly apart, to make an eye in the joined rope which lies shut when the rope is taut. Its original name was bowdlerised to [...] "cut splice".|$|E
50|$|A talurit swaged sleeve {{is used in}} a {{mechanical}} splicing system, to make an <b>eye</b> <b>splice</b> in a steel wire rope. The most common and useful type of end fitting for a wire rope is to turn the end back to form a loop. A thimble can be installed inside the loop to preserve the natural shape of the loop and protect the cable from pinching and abrading {{on the inside of}} the loop. The loose end is then fixed back on the wire rope by means of a swaged sleeve (ferrule). The thimble prevents disrupting of the wires.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>eye</b> <b>splice</b> {{has several}} advantages. The most notable is the {{permanence}} of the loop. An equally important, but less noted [...] advantage, {{is the lack of}} stress it puts on the rope. Splices average 10-15% of rope strength decay, which is very low compared to even the strongest knots. Literature and reference sources typically attribute only a 5% strength decay for a properly tied splice. Technically, a perfectly tied splice retains 100% of the original strength of the rope, but only a trained professional is considered capable of performing this task. Destructive testing of rope in manufacturing facilities makes use of a professional and spliced eyes for connecting the rope to the testing apparatus.|$|E
50|$|A lasso is {{made from}} stiff rope so that the noose stays open when the lasso is thrown. It also allows the cowboy to easily open up the noose from horseback to release the cattle because the rope is stiff enough to be pushed a little. A high quality lasso is {{weighted}} for better handling. The lariat has a small reinforced loop at one end, called a honda or hondo, through which the rope passes to form a loop. The honda can be formed by a honda knot (or another loop knot), an <b>eye</b> <b>splice,</b> a seizing, rawhide, or a metal ring. The other end is sometimes tied simply in a small, tight, overhand knot to prevent fraying. Most modern lariats are made of stiff nylon or polyester rope, usually about 5/16 or 3/8 in (8 or 9.5 mm) diameter and in lengths of 28, 30, or 35 ft (8.5, 9 or 11 m) for arena-style roping and anywhere from 45 to 70 ft (14 to 21 m) for Californio-style roping. The reata is made of braided (or less commonly, twisted) rawhide and is made in lengths from 50 ft to over 100 ft (15 m to over 30 m). Mexican maguey (agave) and cotton ropes are also used in the longer lengths.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2004 Steel {{wire rope}} is the {{accepted}} standard in logging. It is strong, durable, stiff, and dependable in the logger's arsenal. However, {{steel wire rope}} has several disadvantages: its strength to weight ratio is low; it is difficult and time-consuming to splice; and used wire ropes contain jaggers. Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMW-PE) braided rope has potential to replace steel wire rope. The offshore mooring and shipping industries have appreciated it for years. Characteristics such as a specific gravity less than one (it floats!), high flexibility, low stretch, and ease of splicing make the synthetic rope useful. At equivalent diameters, synthetic rope has an equal or greater breaking strength to that of steel wire rope, but at 1 / 7 the weight. This thesis is {{an investigation of the}} end connectors for the unique physical, mechanical, and thermal properties of UHMW-PE 12 -strand braided rope that make this technology of interest in logging applications. This studied focused on three diameter classes of the synthetic rope that are common to logging operations: 3 / 8 ", 9 / 16 ", and 5 / 8 ". Within each diameter class there were five different spools representing separate production runs. A randomized complete block design was used with each diameter class and the corresponding five spools a separate population. Following the laboratory tests, the breaking strengths were compared to the buried <b>eye</b> <b>splice.</b> Three types of end connectors were evaluated during this pilot study. They are identified as spliced, adhesives, and dry hardware. Spliced end connections provided consistent performance in breaking strengths. The end connections with adhesives had variable strength performance laboratory tests and are therefore not recommended. Within the dry hardware end connections, the pinned nubbin and knuckle link provided the highest breaking strength relative to the buried <b>eye</b> <b>splice.</b> This project has accomplished its objectives. It was the first extensive study on end connections specifically designed for synthetic rope. New end connections were developed and steel wire rope connections were modified to meet the strength and usability criteria for timber harvesting operations. Suitable end connections for forest operations were: buried <b>eye</b> <b>splice,</b> Whoopie Sling, long splice, rope clamps, knuckle link, pinned nubbin, and Y-splice. These end connections suitable for use with forest operations were identified and recommended user guidelines were given. Further research and development needs to be conducted on these seven concepts with larger sample sizes and in varied conditions...|$|E

40|$|Research into knots, splices {{and other}} methods of forming an eye {{termination}} has been limited, {{despite the fact}} that they are essential and strongly affect the performance of a rope. The aim of this study was to carry out a comprehensive initial assessment of the breaking strength of eye terminations commonly used in a sailing environment, thereby providing direction for further work in the field. Supports for use in a regular tensile testing machine were specially developed to allow individual testing of each sample and a realistic spread of statistical data to be obtained. Over 180 break tests were carried out on four knots (the bowline, double bowline, figure-of-eight loop and perfection loop) and two splices (three-strand <b>eye</b> <b>splice</b> and braid-on-braid splice). The factors affecting their strength were investigated. A statistical approach to the analysis of the results was adopted. The type of knot was found to have a significant effect on the strength. This same effect was seen in both types of rope construction (three-strand and braid-on-braid). Conclusions were also drawn as to the effect of splice length, eye size, manufacturer and rope diameter on the breaking strength of splices. Areas of development and further investigation were identified...|$|E
40|$|Two {{different}} splicing {{methods for}} double-braid line {{have been tested}} to simu-late a loading condition in which {{the eye of a}} line under tension is rotated around a bollard as might occur during a docking operation. The Blue Book splice-(-*) method, used on double-braid line before 1976, is thought to have one leg of the eye that is significantly weaker than the other. The Red Book splice [...] *) method, a revision of the Blue Book, is thought to eliminate the weakness of the Blue 3 ook splice. The results of these tests shown that the strength of a line with the Red 2 ook <b>eye</b> <b>splice</b> is not reduced when loaded in rotational loading; buth legs of the splice are equal in strength. The weakness in one leg of the Blue Book splice is confirmed; it fails in rotational loading when the load in the standing part of the line reaches 620 of rated break strength (RBS). The Red Book splice is approximately 9. 816 stronger than the Blue Book splice in straight-pull conditions (i. e. no rotation). Nylon 3 -strand twisted line is included for comparison with double-braid line. Results indicate that one leg of the eye fails in rotational loading when the load in the line reaches 8100 RBS because the tucks in the splice fail and the splice pulls apart freeing the end of the leg. ...|$|E
