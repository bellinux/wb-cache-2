5|$|Despite the {{continued}} designs {{and interest in}} the idea, no funding was ever appropriated <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> of a flight-deck cruiser; in addition, evaluation of the design by the Naval War College determined that even a 12,000-ton ship was {{too small for the}} concept's intended characteristics to be effectively realized, and thus the ship would be ineffective in battle. In 1940, the design was formally shelved, although provision was made for reconsideration of the concept at a future date. The entry of the United States into World War II following the bombing of Pearl Harbor, however, removed the primary justifications for the concept of a hybrid warship, as naval limitations treaties were now moot and adequate funding was now available <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> of more conventional ships. As a result, the flight deck cruiser concept was never revisited.|$|E
