5|$|As per Tulsidas, Rama is the {{efficient}} and material cause (Nimitta and Upadana) of the world, which <b>is</b> <b>real</b> since Rama <b>is</b> <b>real.</b> In several verses of the Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas {{says that the}} animate and inanimate world is a manifestation of Rama, and the universe is the cosmic form of Rama. Authors interpret these verses to mean that the world <b>is</b> <b>real</b> according to Tulsidas, {{in keeping with the}} Vishishtadvaita philosophy of Ramanuja. However, at some places in the Ramcharitmanas and Kavitavali, Tulsidas compares the world to a night or a dream and says it is Mithya (false or unreal). Some commentators interpret these verses to mean that in Tulsidas' opinion the world is unreal as per the Vivartavada doctrine of Adi Shankara, while some others interpret them to mean that the world is transient yet real as per the Satkhyativada doctrine of Ramananda. Uday Bhanu Singh concludes that in Tulsidas' view, the world is essentially the form of Rama and appears to be different from Rama due to Maya. Its visible form is transient, which is what Tulsidas means by Mithya.|$|E

5|$|According to Nurkse, {{underdeveloped}} countries lack adequate {{purchasing power}}. Low purchasing power {{means that the}} real income of the people is low, although in monetary terms it may be high. If the money income were low, the problem could easily be overcome by expanding the money supply; however, since the meaning in this context <b>is</b> <b>real</b> income, expanding the supply of money will only generate inflationary pressure. Neither real output nor real investment will rise. It is to be noted that a low purchasing power means that domestic demand for commodities is low. Apart from encompassing consumer goods and services, this includes the demand for capital as well.|$|E

Hopper beats Flik {{in retaliation}} and says that the ants are humble and lowly life forms who live to serve the grasshoppers. However, Flik responds that Hopper actually fears the colony, because he has always known what they are capable of, inspiring the ants and the Circus Bugs to fight back against the grasshoppers. The ants attempt to force Hopper out of Ant Island, but it suddenly begins to rain. In the ensuing chaos, Hopper kidnaps Flik and flees. After the Circus Bugs fail to catch them, Atta rescues Flik. As Hopper pursues them, Flik lures him to the nest of the bird he, Dot, and the Circus Bugs encountered earlier. Thinking that the bird is another decoy, Hopper taunts it before discovering it <b>is</b> <b>real,</b> and is captured and fed to its chicks.|$|E

She falls in love with him but circumstances, and their egos, prevent them both from expressing their feelings. One day, Balu pretends to suffer from chest pain, which scares Geetha, causing her to finally admit that she loves him. Later, when Geetha and Ramaiah go to Balu to enquire about his health, Balu, exiting from the bathroom, fails to see that Geetha is there. He tells Ramaiah about the prank he played on her, and that he was only pretending to have chest pain. Angry that she has been deceived by Balu, she begins to {{question}} whether or not his professed love for her <b>is</b> <b>real.</b> Hurt, she brings her friends, who are on a holiday trip to Shimla, to the residence and tries to drive Balu out of the house.

5|$|Based on estimations of the {{primordial}} mass required to form Uranus and Neptune, {{as well as}} bodies as large as Pluto (see below), earlier models of the Kuiper belt had suggested {{that the number of}} large objects would increase by a factor of two beyond 50AU, so this sudden drastic falloff, known as the Kuiper cliff, was unexpected, and to date its cause is unknown. In 2003, Bernstein, Trilling, et al. found evidence that the rapid decline in objects of 100km or more in radius beyond 50AU <b>is</b> <b>real,</b> and not due to observational bias. Possible explanations include that material at that distance was too scarce or too scattered to accrete into large objects, or that subsequent processes removed or destroyed those that did. Patryk Lykawka of Kobe University claimed that the gravitational attraction of an unseen large planetary object, perhaps the size of Earth or Mars, might be responsible.|$|E

Cristiano Ronaldo also holds {{the record for the}} most league goals scored in one season (48 in 2014–15), alongside being Real's top goalscorer of all time in La Liga history with 285 goals. Di Stéfano's 49goals in 58matches was for decades the all-time highest tally in the European Cup, until it was surpassed by Raúl in 2005, which now is held by Cristiano Ronaldo with 105 goals.

Although the history of life shows an {{apparent}} trend towards the evolution of biological complexity; {{there is a question}} if this appearance of increased complexity <b>is</b> <b>real,</b> or if it comes from neglecting the fact that the majority of life on Earth has always consisted of prokaryotes. In this view, complexity is not a necessary consequence of evolution, but that specific circumstances of evolution on Earth frequently made greater complexity advantageous and thus naturally selected for. Depending on the situation, organisms' complexity can either increase, decrease, or stay the same, and all three of these trends have been observed in evolution.|$|E
