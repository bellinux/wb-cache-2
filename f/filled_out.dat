5|$|As a song full of {{gospel and}} soulful influences, it allowed Mariah to really tear loose and show {{what she could}} do – which in reality was {{far more than the}} vocal {{gymnastics}} that seemed to comprise her reputation so far. From a deep rumble to a high wail, she covered five octaves wonderfully, as the power of the tune built. The backing vocals – which once again had those churchy harmonies – <b>filled</b> <b>out</b> the spare melody, as did the stately horns, which entered towards the end. The song was truly a vocal showcase for Mariah.|$|E
5|$|As in Iaşi, Goldfaden {{arrived in}} Bucharest with his {{reputation}} already established. He and his players performed {{first in the}} early spring at the salon Lazăr Cafegiu on Calea Văcăreşti (Văcăreşti Avenue, {{in the heart of the}} ghetto), then, once the weather turned warm, at the Jigniţa garden, a pleasant tree-shaded beer garden on Str. Negru Vodă that up until then had drawn only a neighborhood crowd. He <b>filled</b> <b>out</b> his cast from the great pool of Jewish vocal talent: synagogue cantors. He also recruited two eminently respectable classically trained prima donnas, the sisters Margaretta and Annetta Schwartz.|$|E

His mother, Charlena Rector, worked as a clerk at a local Safeway supermarket, while his father, Milton Bradley Sr., was {{a veteran of the}} Vietnam War, and was awarded a Purple Heart for his service. Bradley was named Milton Bradley Jr. when Milton Bradley Sr. <b>filled</b> <b>out</b> his son's birth {{certificate}} without Rector's permission. According to Bradley Jr.'s mother, Bradley Sr. was addicted to cocaine, physically abused her, and was homeless for several years. Growing up, Bradley had four half-siblings from Rector's previous marriage.|$|E
5|$|Development of Thor: The Dark World {{began in}} April 2011, when {{producer}} Kevin Feige {{announced plans for}} a sequel to follow the crossover film The Avengers. In July 2011, Kenneth Branagh, the director of Thor, withdrew from the project. Brian Kirk and Patty Jenkins were considered to direct the film before Taylor was hired in January 2012. The supporting cast <b>filled</b> <b>out</b> in August 2012, with the hiring of Eccleston, Dennings, and Akinnuoye-Agbaje. Principal photography began in September 2012 in Surrey, England with filming continuing in Iceland and London, before wrapping up in December 2012. Thor: The Dark World was converted to 3D in post-production.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{successful}} release of Iron Man in May 2008, Marvel Studios announced and immediately {{set to work}} on producing a sequel. In July of that same year Theroux was hired to write the script, and Favreau was signed to return and direct. Downey, Paltrow and Jackson were set to reprise their roles from Iron Man, while Cheadle {{was brought in to}} replace Terrence Howard in the role of James Rhodes. In the early months of 2009, Rourke, Rockwell and Johansson <b>filled</b> <b>out</b> the supporting cast, and filming took place from April to July of that year. Like its predecessor the film was shot mostly in California, except for a key sequence in Monaco.|$|E

5|$|Gottesman did his {{graduate}} {{work at the}} University of Minnesota, which then patterned its clinical psychology program on the Boulder model, which emphasized research theory and clinical practice. He joined the graduate program in 1956 after three years with the Navy, supported by the Korean War G.I. Bill. He began investigating personality traits in identical and fraternal twins who had <b>filled</b> <b>out</b> the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI). His Ph.D. thesis, submitted to Psychological Monographs, was rejected before a review {{on the grounds that}} the nature–nurture issue it addressed had already been settled in favor of nurture.

5|$|In 1895, Edward Dean Adams, {{impressed}} {{with what he}} saw when he toured Tesla's lab, agreed to help found the Nikola Tesla Company, set up to fund, develop, and market a variety of previous Tesla patents and inventions {{as well as new}} ones. Alfred Brown signed on, bringing along patents developed under Peck and Brown. The board was <b>filled</b> <b>out</b> with William Birch Rankine and Charles F. Coaney. It found few investors; the mid-1890s was a tough time financially, and the wireless lighting and oscillators patents it was set up to market never panned out. The company would handle Tesla's patents for decades to come.|$|E
5|$|In April 2012, the Boston Herald sparked an {{election}} controversy when it {{drew attention to}} Warren's Association of American Law Schools (AALS) directory entries from 1986 to 1995, which listed her as a minority professor. According to the AALS, the directory was compiled by information supplied by law school deans, based on questionnaires <b>filled</b> <b>out</b> by individual teachers. Warren stated that she had self-identified as having Native American ancestry {{in order to meet}} others with a similar background. Harvard Law School had listed her as a minority professor in response to criticisms about a lack of faculty diversity, but Warren said that she was unaware of this until she read about it in a newspaper during the 2012 election.|$|E

One writer in each {{city with a}} team <b>filled</b> <b>out</b> a ten-place ballot, with ten points for the recipient of a first-place vote, nine for a second-place vote, and so on. In 1938, the BBWAA raised the number of voters to three per city and gave 14 points for a first-place vote. The only significant change since then occurred in 1961, {{when the number of}} voters was reduced to two per league city.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{study has}} Bertin standing and leaning {{on a table}} in an almost Napoleonic pose. His hard, level stare is already established, but the focus seems to be on his groin rather than his face. It is obvious that Ingres struggled with the sketch; the head is on a square of attached paper which must have replaced an earlier cut-out version, and other areas have been rubbed over and heavily reworked. The next extant drawing shows Bertin seated, but the chair is missing. The last extant sketch is the closest to the eventual painting, with a chair, though his bulk has not yet been <b>filled</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Iron Man 2 in May 2010, Favreau, who served as director, decided not to return, and in February 2011 Black was hired to write and direct the film. Black and Pearce opted to make the script more character-centric and focused on thriller elements. Throughout April and May 2012, the film's {{supporting}} cast was <b>filled</b> <b>out,</b> with Kingsley, Pearce, and Hall brought in to portray key roles. Filming began on May 23, and lasted through December 17, 2012, primarily at EUE/Screen Gems Studios in Wilmington, North Carolina. Additional shooting took place at various locations around North Carolina, as well as Florida, China, and Los Angeles. The visual effects were handled by 17 companies, including Scanline VFX, Digital Domain, and Weta Digital. The film was converted to 3D in post-production.|$|E
