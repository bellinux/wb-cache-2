5|$|In the Main Story, Nero is a {{young man}} who lives in the castle-town of Fortuna on a mysterious island, {{isolated}} {{from the rest of the}} world. Fortuna is home to The Order of the Sword, a sect of holy knights who worship the demon Sparda as their God. Their leader, is the High Priest Sanctus, who leads the congregation as a benevolent spiritual leader, despite Nero's clear lack of faith. With the white hair and attitude not unlike a descendant of Sparda, his true parentage remains a mystery. Discovered on the island as a baby, Nero was sent to live with Credo, The Captain of the Holy Knights, who raised Nero to fight demons alongside his peaceful younger sister Kyrie, whom Nero eventually develops feelings for. Though Nero does not believe in The Order’s worship of Sparda, and openly subverts convention by using firearms, and customizing his own sword with a motorcycle <b>handle</b> <b>that</b> shoots flames, he truly believes in protecting the innocent.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Hans Schnellar, the timpanist of the Vienna Philharmonic, {{developed}} a tuning mechanism {{in which the}} bowl is moved via a <b>handle</b> <b>that</b> connects to the base and the head remains stationary. These instruments {{are referred to as}} Viennese timpani (Wiener Pauken) or Schnellar timpani. Adams Musical Instruments developed a pedal-operated version of this tuning mechanism in the early 21st century.|$|E

25|$|A new rifle {{based on}} the SS1, being {{replaced}} in the Indonesian military after tests had been conducted from 2003–2005. It has been adopted by Indonesian security forces in 2006. It has a carrying <b>handle</b> <b>that</b> can be replaced with a scope for scope mounting on a Picatinny rail and a side-folding stock. It is the only rifle variant that the Pindad SPG-1A underbarrel grenade launcher can be used.|$|E
25|$|The SS2 is {{an upgrade}} of the Pindad SS1, being a {{licensed}} {{version of the}} FN FNC. The SS2's flash suppressor is based on that of the Colt M16A2, {{and it has a}} reciprocating charging <b>handle</b> <b>that</b> can be used for forward assist, with the front sight being based on the AK rifles. The carrying handle and detachable rear sight is placed on top of Picatinny railings. Most of the SS2 rifle variants can have its carry handle removed in order to gain access to its picatinny railings to install various optics.|$|E
25|$|Ridley also improvised a vital {{piece of}} {{equipment}} at the last minute. Two days before taking the X-1 on its first supersonic flight, Chuck Yeager broke two ribs in a horseback riding accident. With the aid of an understanding civilian doctor, {{he was able to}} conceal his condition from everyone but Ridley. Without the full use of his right arm, however, {{it would be impossible to}} seal himself into the tiny X-1 cockpit. Ridley quietly provided a length of broom <b>handle</b> <b>that</b> Yeager was able to use to close the hatch without difficulty.|$|E

25|$|Locking pliers, Mole grips or Vise-Grips are pliers {{that can}} be locked into position, using an {{over-center}} action. One side of the handle includes a bolt {{that is used to}} adjust the spacing of the jaws, {{the other side of the}} handle, especially in larger models, often includes a lever to push the two sides of the handles apart to unlock the pliers. William Petersen of DeWitt, Nebraska, invented and patented a primitive version of a wrench in 1921. However, it wasn't until 1924 that the first locking pliers with a locking <b>handle</b> <b>that</b> Petersen called the Vise-Grip was patented.|$|E
25|$|The export {{versions}} have {{a single}} telescopic sight with a 1.5× magnification and an aiming reticle fixed at 300 m. All rifles are adapted to use the Hensoldt NSA 80 third-generation night sight, which clamps into the G36 carry handle adapter {{in front of the}} optical sight housing and mates with the rifle's standard optical sight. The sighting bridge also functions as a carrying handle and features auxiliary open sights molded on top of the <b>handle</b> <b>that</b> consist of a forward blade and rear notch, but these can only be used with the reflex sight removed, as in the G36V. The optical sight system is produced by Hensoldt AG (a subsidiary of Carl Zeiss AG).|$|E
25|$|The flight {{touched down}} at about 12:26 on runway 36R, and almost {{immediately}} the right landing gear collapsed. The plane veered off {{the right side of}} the runway, catching fire as it did so. The co-pilot received minor injuries as she evacuated the aircraft, as did one of the five non-revenue FedEx pilots who were on board as passengers. It was later discovered that the non-revenue pilot who activated the slide for the emergency exit had not been adequately trained in its operation, and so accidentally pulled the <b>handle</b> <b>that</b> released the slide as a raft in the event of a landing on water, so that the slide detached from the airplane.|$|E

25|$|Also {{known as}} {{inherent}} vice, the intrinsic instability {{of the fabric}} and components of an objects can lead to its own physical degradation. This is difficult to prevent because it occurs within {{the fabric of the}} material and therefore is a natural occurrence. Deterioration of an object can happen even before the object is used. How the piece is created can instil manufacturing defects in the piece. This means that objects can be damaged even before they are used. This would include a body that contains inadequate qualities of (filler (materials)). A second typical defect is from poor design and construction. An example of this would be a ceramic piece with a <b>handle</b> <b>that</b> is too thin to support the weight of the cup. A third manufacturing defect includes careless firing. A ceramic piece that has been fired too rapidly or allowed to dry too fast will crack or break.|$|E
25|$|The McFlurry is a soft-serve {{ice cream}} dessert that has pieces of candy or cookies mixed into it. The McFlurry was first {{integrated}} into the menu at a Bathurst, New Brunswick, Canada franchisee in 1995 and in the United States in 1998. The flavors are crushed Oreo, M's Minis, Reese's, or Mars, Incorporated candy bars like Snickers, Twix, Galaxy, etc., Cadbury's candy bars like Twirl, Wispa, Creme Egg, Crunchie etc., Nestlé candy bars like Yorkie, Smarties, Drifter, Rolo, Butterfinger, etc. McDonald's also does limited time only flavors, e.g. for Shrek the Third it released the Ogre-Load flavor. In Australia, they had a special range for their 40 years in Australia celebration. The flavors were double choc fudge, bubblegum squash, strawberry crumble and caramel cookie. Also in Malaysia, a unique flavor called FuseofmyLife is offered to customers. The mixing blade for the dessert is actually a specially designed spoon with a hollow <b>handle</b> <b>that</b> attaches to the mixer spindle (except in Australia and New Zealand where the staff mix it by hand). The blade is used once then given to the customer to use as an eating utensil. Originally test marketed in Hawaii in 1997, it is now available in most of its markets.|$|E
500|$|Bradman's early {{development}} {{was shaped by}} the high bounce of the ball on matting-over-concrete pitches. He favoured [...] "horizontal-bat" [...] shots (such as the hook, pull and cut) {{to deal with the}} bounce and devised a unique grip on the bat <b>handle</b> <b>that</b> would accommodate these strokes without compromising his ability to defend. Employing a side-on stance at the wicket, Bradman kept perfectly still as the bowler ran in. His backswing had a [...] "crooked" [...] look that troubled his early critics, but he resisted entreaties to change. His backswing kept his hands in close to the body, leaving him perfectly balanced and able to change his stroke mid-swing, if need be. Another telling factor was the decisiveness of Bradman's footwork. He [...] "used the crease" [...] by either coming metres down the wicket to drive, or playing so far back that his feet ended up level with the stumps when playing the cut, hook or pull.|$|E

500|$|Kubrick {{credited}} {{the ease}} with which he photographed scenes to his early years as a photographer. He rarely added camera instructions in the script, preferring to <b>handle</b> <b>that</b> after a scene is created, as the visual part of film-making came easiest to him. Even in deciding which props and settings would be used, Kubrick paid meticulous attention to detail and tried to collect as much background material as possible, functioning rather like what he described as [...] "a detective". Cinematographer John Alcott, who worked closely with Kubrick on four of his films, and won an Oscar for Best Cinematography on Barry Lyndon, remarked that Kubrick [...] "questions everything", and was involved in the technical aspects of film-making including camera placement, scene composition, choice of lens, and even operating the camera which would usually be left to the cinematographer. Alcott considered Kubrick to be the [...] "nearest thing to genius I've ever worked with, with all the problems of a genius".|$|E
500|$|However, {{some critics}} {{felt that the}} album was overly ambitious and that the band's musical {{departure}} may alienate listeners. Chad Grischow of IGN felt that the album's dramatic hooks seem [...] "bloated" [...] at times: [...] "The band does a great of focusing on what they do best, but the album does drown itself a bit with all the overwhelming enormity of it all." [...] Scott Shetler of Slant disliked the [...] "melodramatic" [...] undertones of [...] "I've Got All This Ringing in My Ears and None on My Fingers" [...] and [...] "Golden", writing [...] "they don't <b>handle</b> <b>that</b> style quite as well as Panic! at the Disco". Cory Apar of AllMusic opined that the album's pop direction contradicts the band's lyrical claims of wishing to stick to their roots. He called the album's various styles [...] "hit and miss", yet commented that [...] "Once Infinity on High sinks in, it's indeed a fun record. But for a band that was once so self-assured and able to utilize its talents so compellingly, the album is regrettably haphazard." [...] Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian believed that the album was overly sullen, but noted that [...] "They may not be happy, but they haven't forgotten to be catchy." [...] Barry Nicholson of NME found the amount of guest producers to be unnecessary and disliked some of the songs, but admired the album's [...] "infectious" [...] nature.|$|E
500|$|The casting {{directors}} for Obsessed were Ron Digman and Valorie Massalas. According to Packer, Elba and Larter {{were the}} favorite actors for their respective lead roles; {{he stated that}} [...] "they both brought {{the right amount of}} depth and sex appeal" [...] to the film. He emphasized the need for actors [...] "who were relatable and who can <b>handle</b> <b>that</b> type of human interplay {{that we have in the}} film." [...] Packer showed the film script to Beyoncé's talent agent, who suggested that Beyoncé play the role of Sharon. The producers [...] "immediately ... fell in love with that idea; once she suggested Beyoncé, nobody else could play the role." [...] Packer said that Beyoncé became interested in working on Obsessed because the film was not focused on the music industry, and that it was the first time she played a non-singer. Packer also reported that [...] "she was looking for that challenge and welcomed this opportunity". Beyoncé stated that she found it challenging to concentrate purely on [...] "the emotion and the psychology of the relationship". Beyoncé had never taken part in a fight scene, but she was able to learn how to perform the scenes quickly because they were similar to dance choreography, with which she was familiar. Larter was inspired by Rita Hayworth, Barbara Stanwyck and Faye Dunaway, all of whom had previously portrayed femmes fatale. Obsessed was filmed over the summer of 2008, and the final fight scene between Sharon and Lisa was shot over one week.|$|E
