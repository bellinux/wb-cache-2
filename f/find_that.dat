5000|$|Most of {{this article}} {{discusses}} research on relations between states. However, {{there is also evidence}} that democracies have less internal systematic violence. For instance, one study <b>finds</b> <b>that</b> the most democratic and the most authoritarian states have few civil wars, and intermediate regimes the most. The probability for a civil war is also increased by political change, regardless whether toward greater democracy or greater autocracy. Intermediate regimes continue to be the most prone to civil war, regardless of the time since the political change. In the long run, since intermediate regimes are less stable than autocracies, which in turn are less stable than democracies, durable democracy is the most probable end-point of the process of democratization [...] Abadie (2004) study <b>finds</b> <b>that</b> the most democratic nations have the least terrorism. Harff (2003) <b>finds</b> <b>that</b> genocide and politicide are rare in democracies. Rummel (1997) <b>finds</b> <b>that</b> the more democratic a regime, the less its democide. He <b>finds</b> <b>that</b> democide has killed six times as many people as battles.|$|R

40|$|Surveying online {{practices}} of American youth and their civic and political engagement, this working paper <b>finds</b> <b>that</b> most youth are not consistently exposed to either echo chambers or divergent perspectives. Some see the Internet {{as a means}} of exposure to divergent perspectives, while others believe that it is likely to foster echo chambers. This paper agrees {{that it is important to}} attend to these possibilities, but <b>finds</b> <b>that</b> this discussion is often framed inappropriately. Rather, it <b>finds</b> <b>that</b> most youth are exposed to views that align with and diverge from their own, or they are exposed to neither. The paper also <b>finds</b> <b>that</b> political interest, particular forms of online participation, and digital media literacy education can promote greater exposure to these diverse perspectives.

By exploring the institutional design choices of international delegation, she <b>finds</b> <b>that</b> dispute resolution is the most commonly delegated function and often involves externally delegating authority to an existing arbitration tribunal or an international court. Furthermore, she <b>finds</b> <b>that</b> external delegation in particular increases with the existence of complex cooperation problems such as enforcement and uncertainty and with the heterogeneity and number of parties...|$|R
