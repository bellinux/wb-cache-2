25|$|Testaments are {{regarded}} as exhortatory writings; ethics therefore are fundamental to the text. The Testaments have many different ethical motifs, the foremost of which is adhering to God's commandments. In this regard, {{it is interesting to}} note that the ethics in the Testaments generally start out very precise; each testament discusses a certain vice or virtue. Usually this is then concluded with a very vague and <b>general</b> <b>reference</b> to God's law and commandments.|$|E

25|$|The Washington-Franklin Issues were {{unique in}} the sense that these {{subjects}} were the only ones found on definitive stamps for more than a decade. Beginning in 1908 the Washington-Franklin definitive stamps were issued over a twelve-year period in denominations ranging from one cent to , with different colors for each denomination, all with the same engraved profile of Washington or Franklin. While both Washington and Franklin occur on the 1-cent values, both in green, only one of them appears in a given series (Franklin on the issues until 1912, Washington on the subsequent releases). In the first issue, Franklin appeared only on the one-cent value, while the same Washington image graced the remaining eleven denominations, which ranged from two cents to one dollar. In later issues, Washington was present only on the seven denominations between one cent and seven cents, and all the higher values were assigned to Franklin. The engraving of Washington was modeled after a bust by the renowned sculptor Jean Antoine Houdon. The few examples exhibited here are largely representative of this greater series. Franklin is displayed once here for <b>general</b> <b>reference</b> to the Washington-Franklin issues.|$|E
