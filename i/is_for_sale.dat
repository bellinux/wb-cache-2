5|$|Camak House, at 279 Meigs Street, Athens, Georgia, {{was built}} in about 1834 by James Camak and {{featured}} in Georgia's early railroad history. An example of Federal architecture, it {{has a number of}} features unusual for its period, including a kitchen within the raised basement and closets. Both main floors have four rooms; the stairwell has a mahogany railing, and moldings and trim were made using a Greek key pattern. After long service as a family home, it was used as a Masonic Lodge before being bought by Coca-Cola Enterprises. In 1975 Camak House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, but the building had by then fallen into disrepair. It was restored and used as the offices of a law firm.

The only constraint is that excessive spending by any sector of the economy (whether households, firms or public) has the potential to cause inflationary pressures.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of deteriorating {{conditions}} at Central VPA, the St. Louis Board of Education heard several proposals on moving Central VPA to another building.

In the summer of 2004, the Board announced that Central VPA would move into the former Southwest High School building at the corner of Kingshighway and Arsenal. , the Garrison Avenue building, home to Yeatman High School from 1904 to 1927 and to Central from 1927 to 2004, <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> for $250,000.|$|E

500|$|Most of the {{cartoons}} Davenport drew during the 1896 campaign were simple in execution and somber in mood. One, for example, depicts Hanna walking down Wall Street, bags {{of money in}} each hand and a grin on his face. [...] Another shows only Hanna's hand and wrist—and McKinley dangling from his fob chain. [...] One that {{is intended to be}} funny depicts McKinley as a small boy accompanied by Hanna as nursemaid; McKinley tugs at Hanna's skirts, wanting to go into a shop where the labor vote <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>sale.</b> [...] Another shows Hanna wearing a Napoleon hat (McKinley was said to resemble the late emperor), raising a mask of McKinley's face to his own.|$|E
500|$|He {{would claim}} that the Sex Pistols were his personal, Situationist-style art project: [...] "I decided to use people, just the way a {{sculptor}} uses clay." [...] But what had he supposedly made? The Sex Pistols were as substantial as pop culture could get: [...] "Punk became the most important cultural phenomenon of the late 20th century", McLaren would later assert. [...] "Its authenticity stands out against the karaoke ersatz culture of today, where everything and everyone <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>sale....</b> unk is not, and never was, for sale." [...] Or they were a cynical con: something with which [...] "to sell trousers", as McLaren said in 1989; a [...] "carefully planned exercise to embezzle {{as much money as}} possible out of the music industry", as Jon Savage characterises McLaren's core theme in The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle; [...] "cash from chaos" [...] as the movie repeatedly puts it.|$|E
500|$|Starting {{to appear}} more frequently, Dotty became a {{recurring}} character. Santer told Digital Spy in May 2009 that Dotty's storyline would go [...] "to a very, very dark place!" [...] He {{questioned whether the}} character was born bad or if her father had made her that way, and if she could be more dangerous than Nick. As the storyline between Dot, Dotty and Nick progressed, Nick's true agenda was revealed when he blackmailed his mother into giving him money for custody of Dotty. A BBC source told The Sun, [...] " [...] horrified when Nick tells her Dotty <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>sale.</b> He shows no emotion and his evil grin sends shivers down her spine. She always knew Nick would sell his soul {{for the price of}} some pick ’n mix but she had no idea he’d sell his own daughter." [...] In a further plot twist, it was revealed to the audience in 2009, that Dotty was colluding with her father all along. The plot climaxed in June 2009 and marked Altman's departure from the show for the fourth time. Dotty later left on 23 February 2010.|$|E

500|$|Davis {{verbally}} {{committed to}} Kentucky on August 13, 2010, choosing {{it over his}} other finalists, which were DePaul, Ohio State, and Syracuse. He had officially visited DePaul and Ohio State. On August 24, 2010, he became the number one rated player in the national class of 2011 at Scout.com. [...] The pay-for-play scandal had played out very publicly in the press. Before Davis committed to Kentucky, the Chicago Sun-Times reported that his father, Anthony Davis, Sr. asked Kentucky for $200,000 for a commitment from his son. The report was initially released on Wednesday August 4, 2010 by Sun-Times reporter Michael O'Brien. Citing [...] "a reliable source", he posted the following text [...] "rumors/sources that have Davis choosing Kentucky are also alleging that the commitment cost $200,000." [...] before it was edited to say [...] "rumors that Davis' commitment <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> have surfaced since he cut his list of schools down about a month ago." [...] and then removed later that day from the Sun-Times high school sports website following a threat from a University of Kentucky lawyer. A Lexington, Kentucky law firm sent a letter under the signature of attorney Stephen L. Barker that expressed a [...] "formal demand that you (O'Brien and the Sun-Times) withdraw the publication from any source from which it has been published, and issue an immediate statement that you know of no credible evidence indicating {{that there is any}} truth to the 'rumors' referred to in your article." [...] Baker's letter also threatened potential [...] "punitive damages for your malicious and willful actions." [...] Anthony Davis Sr. declined to speak to the Chicago Tribune on August 4 regarding the allegation, although he denied the allegations to the Sun-Times stating [...] "We haven't asked anyone for anything, and no one has offered us anything", on July 30 before the story broke.|$|E

2500|$|All Souls Church {{was listed}} at Grade C by English Heritage on 14 September 1976. [...] Grade C {{was part of}} an old {{superseded}} scale of ratings used only for Anglican churches; it was equivalent to the present Grade II, which signifies a [...] "nationally important" [...] building of [...] "special interest". [...] The church was later reassessed and upgraded to Grade II*, the second highest status; such buildings are considered [...] "particularly important... of more than special interest". [...] As of February 2001, it was one of 13 Grade II* listed buildings, and 535 listed buildings of all grades, in the borough of Hastings. [...] As of , the church <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> on a freehold or leasehold basis. [...] In October 2014, The Victorian Society stated the church was one of [...] "the top ten most endangered Victorian and Edwardian buildings in England and Wales" [...] and that there was a risk of the church being demolished.|$|E
2500|$|Radon is an invisible, {{radioactive}} atomic {{gas that}} results from the radioactive decay of radium, which {{may be found in}} rock formations beneath buildings or in certain building materials themselves. [...] Radon is probably the most pervasive serious hazard for indoor air in the United States and Europe, probably responsible {{for tens of thousands of}} deaths from lung cancer each year. There are relatively simple test kits for do-it-yourself radon gas testing, but if a home <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> the testing must be done by licensed person in some U.S. states. Radon gas enters buildings as a soil gas and is a heavy gas and thus will tend to accumulate at the lowest level. Radon may also be introduced into a building through drinking water particularly from bathroom showers. Building materials can be a rare source of radon, but little testing is carried out for stone, rock or tile products brought into building sites; radon accumulation is greatest for well insulated homes. The half life for radon is 3.8 days, indicating that once the source is removed, the hazard will be greatly reduced within a few weeks. Radon mitigation methods include sealing concrete slab floors, basement foundations, water drainage systems, or by increasing ventilation. They are usually cost effective and can greatly reduce or even eliminate the contamination and the associated health risks.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{suspicious}} {{to begin}} with, Dot accepted them both into her home, believing that Nick truly had changed this time. Asked whether Nick {{really was a}} reformed character, Altman remained ambiguous: [...] "Nick's back, he's got a cute little daughter. He's become a plumber, he's a changed man. ...Or is he?" [...] As the storyline progressed, Nick's true agenda was revealed when he blackmailed his mother into giving him money for custody of Dotty. A BBC source reportedly told The Sun, [...] " [...] horrified when Nick tells her Dotty <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>sale.</b> He shows no emotion and his evil grin sends shivers down her spine. She always knew Nick would sell his soul {{for the price of}} some pick ’n mix but she had no idea he’d sell his own daughter." [...] In a further plot twist, it was revealed to the audience in 2009, that Dotty (real name Kirsty) was colluding with her father all along. In the storyline, Dotty suggested killing Dot for her life assurance policy. Nick leaves following this, allowing Dotty to work on Dot and he returns three months later where they begin their plan to convince Dot and her friends that she is suffering with dementia; Nick's aim being to kill Dot and blame her death on her deteriorating mental state. During Nick's brief stay in the square, he overheard Billy Mitchell telling Dot how he let Jase Dyer die and Nick blackmailed Billy by demanding regular payments or he would tell Jase's son Jay what Billy did. When Billy's cousin, Phil, found out about this, he led Nick into the barrel store of The Queen Vic, where he beats him up and ties him to a chair. Phil gave Billy the opportunity to scare Nick off and end this, however, Billy let him go and told Jay the truth himself. The plot with his own daughter to kill his beloved mother climaxes on-screen in June 2009: Nick's plan goes awry after Dotty has a change of heart and ultimately rescues her grandmother from being poisoned, instead drugging Nick. This leads to a series of events whereby Nick, in a bid to escape once his plan has been exposed, holds various members of the community hostage in the café and an accidental fire is started after Heather Trott pushes Nick into the chip pan. The hostages manage to escape due to a fight between Nick and Ryan Malloy, {{who was one of the}} hostages. This results in an explosion at the café with Nick and Bradley Branning inside. The storyline marked Altman's departure from the show once again. His departing episode was scripted as a cliffhanger, as it was not revealed whether Nick had survived the explosion at the end of the episode. However, in the following episode, on 4 June 2009, Nick is shown to survive the explosion and Bradley is hospitalised with injuries to his eye. Nick departs after once again being disowned by Dot. Dotty is left in Dot's care despite Nick explaining to his mother that Dotty is evil.|$|E
