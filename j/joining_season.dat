5000|$|During their {{rehearsal}} era in {{the late}} 1980s, the band began as grindcore and released various demos and splits with other bands from the Athens area. The group would later alter their sound with influence from proto-black metal bands like Celtic Frost and Venom, {{and in the process}} became one of the genre's instigators. Their 5-song demo, Satanas Tedeum, would show a grindcore/black metal crossover, followed by their career-breaking album, Passage to Arcturo, in 1991. One of band's first major appearances was on the 1993 [...] "Fuck Christ Tour" [...] consisting of Immortal and Blasphemy. During this concert, some audience members had engaged in cutting and self-mutilation that resulted in hospitalization. Before signing to Unisound, Mayhem's Øystein Aarseth had expressed interest in distributing the band through his Deathlike Silence Productions label, but due to Aarseth's murder the same year, nothing materialized. The band would sign to Century Media in 1996 and remain on their roster for 10 years before <b>joining</b> <b>Season</b> of Mist.|$|E

40|$|Wool weight, fleece {{components}} and reproductive performance of Corriedale and Romney sheep joined within three periods (14 january- 25 february, 01 march- 12 april and 15 april- 27 may) and stocked at two rates (10 ewes/ha and 15 ewes/ha) on paddocks of winter improved pasture (Trifolium repens and Lolium multiflorum) up to weaning, were examined during 5 years (1977 - 1981) at EMBRAPA, Bage, RS, Brazil. In the environment employed, {{the results were}} consistent in showing that Corriedales were superior to Romneys either in wool quantity and quality or in reproductive performance, and indicated that when 10 or 15 ewes are stocked per hectare, the higher stocking rate did not cause any harmful effect on both wool or reproductive components. Fleeces produced from ewes in later joinings were somewhat lighter, {{but there was a}} good improvement in their reproductive performance. Considering the significant <b>joining</b> <b>season</b> x stocking rate interaction, the results also showed that wool production at the higher rate of stocking is dependent on the <b>joining</b> <b>season</b> employed. 199...|$|E
40|$|Wool {{production}} and reproductive performance components of similar genotypes, brought from distinct production areas, were evaluated during five years trial at similar environments, such as, <b>joining</b> <b>season</b> and stocking rate on winter improved pasture. The least squares means {{revealed that the}} origin (breed) effect concentrated upon the Corriedale ewes wool production, whereas in Romney females it affected the reproductive performance. In the abscence of interaction between origin (breed) and year for most variables, {{it was assumed that}} the farm management procedures and/or selection criteria applied on hoggets were determinant of the subsequent lifetime production within each genotype examined. Expecting a better reproductive performance in Romneys, mainly rate of lambs born, weaned and lambs weaning weight, comments were made on the selection criteria employed on this breed over many years. The work has demonstrated that "property of origin (breed) " of sheep composing any experiment aiming at breed comparisons, should be considered as a potential factor capable of biasing information on productive aspects...|$|E
