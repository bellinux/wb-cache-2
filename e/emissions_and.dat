40|$|Abstract: This {{document}} {{provides a}} brief summary estimate of Galactic free-free <b>emission</b> <b>and</b> Hα <b>emission</b> <b>and</b> their relationship. Particular {{emphasis is placed on}} estimating the potential freefree emission in the region of significant confusion for CMB anisotropy measurements. Existing x-ray, ultraviolet <b>and</b> Hα <b>emission</b> provide limits on the radio free-free <b>emission</b> <b>and</b> vice versa. These limits are generally somewhat smaller than the observed “free-free ” (signal ∝ ν − 2. 15) microwave signal. If these preliminary results true, then some previously neglected source may be present. Physics argues that Hα emission is still the best tracer for Galactic free-free <b>emission</b> <b>and</b> thus a tool for diagnosing if there is a previously neglected source. ...|$|R

5|$|In February 1940, Glenn Seaborg and Edwin McMillan {{produced}} plutonium-239 {{through the}} bombardment of uranium. In their experiments bombarding uranium with deuterons, they observed {{the creation of}} neptunium, element 93, which then underwent beta-decay {{to form a new}} element, plutonium, with 94 protons. Kennedy built a series of detectors and counters to verify the presence of plutonium.
