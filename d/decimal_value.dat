25|$|On all coins, the beading (ring {{of small}} dots) {{around the edge}} of the obverses has been removed. The obverse of the 20p coin has also been amended to {{incorporate}} the year, which had been on the reverse of the coin since its introduction in 1982 (giving rise to an unusual issue of a mule version without any date at all). The orientation of both sides of the 50p coin has been rotated through 180 degrees, meaning the bottom of the coin is now a corner rather than a flat edge. The numerals showing the <b>decimal</b> <b>value</b> of each coin, previously present on all coins except £2 and £1, have been removed, leaving the values spelled out in words only.|$|E

The originated text is transformed into <b>decimal</b> <b>values</b> and passed to encoder module. In this module values are cluttered using binary operations present in most systems with keys. This routine is based on feistel iteration using large number of rounds for security justification to certain intensity and passed to the security module. This module performs conversion of values into octal base values and then padded with a vector. When compared with other encryption schemes it provides more security even though keys are revealed.
