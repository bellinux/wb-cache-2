5|$|Though the pigeye shark {{will take}} prey <b>from</b> <b>anywhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water column, {{it tends to}} hunt close to the sea floor. An apex predator, it feeds mainly on teleost fishes such as croakers, flatfishes, and cutlassfishes, {{and to a lesser}} extent on {{cartilaginous}} fishes, cephalopods, and decapod crustaceans. It has also been recorded eating gastropods, sea snakes, dolphins, and whale carrion. Other sharks and rays figure much more prominently in the diets of South African pigeye sharks than those from other regions; the types consumed include requiem sharks, catsharks, angel sharks, guitarfishes, stingrays, and eagle rays.|$|E

The first schools independent of the church – Winchester College (1382) Oswestry School (1407) and Eton College (1440) – were closely tied to the universities; they were boarding schools, so they could educate pupils <b>from</b> <b>anywhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nation.|$|E

25|$|Amtrak began {{operations}} in May 1971 {{with a mixture}} of equipment from its predecessor railroads, much of which was painted in a variety of railroad-specific paint schemes.

To build the brand of Amtrak as a unified passenger railroad, the equipment was gradually repainted into system-wide Phases starting around 1972 with Phase I.|$|E

25|$|Prior to this event, no {{solar eclipse}} had been visible {{across the entire}} {{contiguous}} United States since June 8, 1918; not since the February 1979 eclipse had a total eclipse been visible <b>from</b> <b>anywhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mainland United States.

25|$|The {{preference}} {{of virtual reality}} exposure therapy over in-vivo exposure therapy is often debated, {{but there are many}} obvious advantages of virtual reality exposure therapy that make it more desirable. For example, the proximity between the client and therapist can cause problems when in-vivo therapy is used and transportation is not reliable for the client or it is impractical for them to travel as far as needed. However, virtual reality exposure therapy can be done <b>from</b> <b>anywhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world if given the necessary tools. Going along with the idea of unavailable transportation and proximity, there are many individuals who require therapy but due to various forms of immobilizations (paralysis, extreme obesity, etc..) they can not physically be moved to where the therapy is conducted. Again, because virtual reality exposure therapy can be conducted anywhere in the world, those with mobility issues will no longer be discriminated against. Another major advantage is fewer ethical concerns than in-vivo exposure therapy. Once again, considering the idea of close proximity no longer being a requirement, this decreases the chances of inappropriate client-therapist relations taking place.|$|E

25|$|In Flemish circles, {{there is}} an ever {{continuing}} worry that the status of Dutch in Brussels will continue to deteriorate, and that the surrounding region will undergo even more Francization. On the political level, {{the division of the}} bilingual Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde (BHV) electoral and judicial district caused much linguistic strife. The district is composed of the 19 municipalities of the Brussels-Capital Region in addition to the 35 municipalities of the Flemish administrative arrondissement of Halle-Vilvoorde. For elections to the Belgian Senate and to the European Parliament, which are organized by linguistic region, residents <b>from</b> <b>anywhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> arrondissement can vote for French-speaking parties in Wallonia and Brussels. For elections to the Belgian Chamber of Representatives, which is usually done by province, voters from Halle-Vilvoorde can vote for parties in Brussels, and vice versa. It was feared that, if BHV was divided, the francophones living in Halle-Vilvoorde would {{no longer be able to}} vote for candidates in Brussels, and they would lose the right to judicial proceedings in French. If a division were to take place, francophone political parties would demand that the Brussels-Capital Region be expanded, a proposal that is unacceptable to Flemish parties. This issue was one of the chief reasons for the 200-day impasse in Belgian government formation in 2007, and it remained a hotly contested issue between the linguistic Communities, until this issue was resolved mid-2012.|$|E
