5|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} the leading cause of death (30%) amongst women in the United States, and the leading cause of chronic disease amongst them, {{affecting}} nearly 40% (Gronowski and Schindler, Tables I and IV). The onset occurs at a later age in women than <b>in</b> <b>men.</b> For instance the incidence of stroke in women under the age of 80 is less than that <b>in</b> <b>men,</b> but higher in those aged over 80. Overall the lifetime risk of stroke in women exceeds that <b>in</b> <b>men.</b> The risk of cardiovascular disease amongst those with diabetes and amongst smokers is also higher in women than <b>in</b> <b>men.</b> Many aspects of cardiovascular disease vary between women and men, including risk factors, prevalence, physiology, symptoms, response to intervention and outcome.|$|E

40|$|A {{specific}} binding protein {{for human}} corticotrophin-releasing hormone (hCRH), {{which does not}} bind to the ovine hormone (oCRH), has recently been demonstrated in human plasma. No such binding protein {{has been found in}} sheep plasma. We have investigated the half-life of human and ovine CRH <b>in</b> <b>man</b> and <b>in</b> sheep. Peptides were measured directly in plasma with two-site immunoradiometric assays, as these assays are unaffected by the presence of inactivated peptide fragments. <b>In</b> <b>man,</b> the half-life of hCRH (30. 5 +/- 3. 3 min; mean +/- S. E. M.) was significantly (P less than 0. 001) less than that of oCRH (42. 8 +/- 6. 4 min). In sheep, {{there was no significant difference}} between the half-life of hCRH (46. 5 +/- 7. 2 min) and that of oCRH (39. 8 +/- 10. 1 min); these half-lives were also significantly (P less than 0. 001) longer than that of hCRH <b>in</b> <b>man.</b> One possible explanation for the shorter half-life of hCRH <b>in</b> <b>man</b> is that the clearance of hCRH is enhanced by CRH-binding protein, although other binding proteins often have the opposite effect. Peak ACTH and cortisol responses occurred earlier in sheep than <b>in</b> <b>man,</b> although no differences were found in the response times to oCRH or hCRH within either species.
