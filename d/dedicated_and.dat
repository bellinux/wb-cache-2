5|$|Tom died of {{pancreatic}} cancer in July 1995—three years before {{construction of the}} park began. During a Chinatown Chamber of Commerce meeting held in March 1998, the Riverside Park Advisory Council suggested renaming the park in honor of Ping Tom, {{the driving force behind}} the its creation. The request was approved on August 3, 1998, and the park was renamed Ping Tom Memorial Park. The park was <b>dedicated</b> <b>and</b> officially opened by Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley during a ceremony on October 2, 1999. In 2005, the CADC and friends of the Tom family commissioned sculptor Liao Huilana to create a bronze bust of Ping Tom.

5|$|Mrs. Puff is SpongeBob's {{paranoid}} driving {{teacher and}} the owner of the town boating school, which is similar to a driver's education facility. She would like nothing more than to pass SpongeBob, as he is her most <b>dedicated</b> <b>and</b> hard-working student, but he routinely panics when he tries to drive a boat and fails every driving test he takes. His failures often result in crashes that lead to mass destruction and endanger Mrs. Puff. While she tries her best to be friendly and patient with her students, Mrs. Puff finds SpongeBob's unintentional recklessness exasperating. She is the long-standing love interest and girlfriend of Mr. Krabs.|$|E

5|$|A {{ceremony}} is held each October 13 at the outfield wall in Oakland {{to listen to}} a taped broadcast of the final game of the 1960 World Series. The tradition was started by Squirrel Hill resident Saul Finkelstein, who at 1:05 pm on October 13, 1985, sat alone {{at the base of the}} flagpole and listened to the NBC radio broadcast of Chuck Thompson and Jack Quinlan. Finkelstein continued the tradition for eight more years, until word spread and other people began attending in 1993. On October 13, 2000—the game's 40th anniversary—over 600people attended to listen to the broadcast, including Mazeroski himself. For the 50th anniversary, on October 13, 2010, a plaque honoring Mazeroski was <b>dedicated</b> <b>and</b> more than 1,000 attended the broadcast, including Mazeroski and several other former Pirates.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving office}} in 1989, the Reagans {{purchased}} {{a home in}} Bel Air, Los Angeles, {{in addition to the}} Reagan Ranch in Santa Barbara. They regularly attended Bel Air Church and occasionally made appearances on behalf of the Republican Party; Reagan delivered a well-received speech at the 1992 Republican National Convention. Previously on November 4, 1991, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library was <b>dedicated</b> <b>and</b> opened to the public. At the dedication ceremonies, five presidents were in attendance, as well as six first ladies, marking the first time that five presidents were gathered in the same location. Reagan continued publicly to speak in favor of a line-item veto; the Brady Bill; a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget; and the repeal of the 22nd Amendment, which prohibits anyone from serving more than two terms as president. In 1992 Reagan established the Ronald Reagan Freedom Award with the newly formed Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation. His final public speech was on February 3, 1994, during a tribute to him in Washington, D.C., and his last major public appearance was at the funeral of Richard Nixon on April 27, 1994.|$|E
5|$|The Glamis road {{opened in}} August 1958, {{and the road}} from Glamis to Palo Verde was under {{construction}} at that time; {{the part of the}} road that was already open was dedicated in October. In 1959, the rest of the current routing of SR78 between Brawley and Palo Verde was added to the state highway system as SR195 and Legislative Route 146. The state legislature added the portion of SR78 from SR115 to the Riverside County line in the 1964 state highway renumbering, also naming the road the Ben Hulse Highway. In March 1964, the Ben Hulse Highway leading to Palo Verde was <b>dedicated,</b> <b>and</b> state senator Hulse's efforts to have the road built were recognized. Following this, in 1965, the newly constructed section was signed as CRS78. The section from Palo Verde to Blythe shows up as part of SR78 on maps as early as 1965, and the section from southwest of Midway Well to Palo Verde is shown as part of SR78 as early as 1966.|$|E

5|$|The {{library was}} founded with the United Nations in 1946. It was {{originally}} called the United Nations Library, later the United Nations International Library. In the late 1950s the Ford Foundation gave {{a grant to}} the United Nations {{for the construction of}} a new library building; Dag Hammarskjöld was also instrumental in securing the funding for the new building. The Dag Hammarskjöld Library was <b>dedicated</b> <b>and</b> renamed on November 16, 1961. The building was a gift from the Ford Foundation and is located next to the Secretariat at the southwest corner of the headquarters campus. The library holds 400,000 books, 9,800 newspapers and periodical titles, 80,000 maps and the Woodrow Wilson Collection containing 8,600 volumes of League of Nations documents and 6,500 related books and pamphlets. The library's Economic and Social Affairs Collection is housed in the DC-2 building.|$|E
5|$|With closer {{proximity}} to schools, more parking, and double {{the availability of}} shelf space, the village purchased the former station for $12,500 ($ today) and leased the building and its acre of land to the library. The library required $20,500 ($ today) for purchasing and renovating the building; it raised $14,000 ($ today) from village residents, with the remainder funded by the village board. On April 19, 1959, the refurbished building was <b>dedicated</b> <b>and</b> the village board named the street {{that led to the}} library Library Road. With its own space, the library increased its collection, hired more staff, and doubled its operating hours. Also in 1959, the library received its absolute charter, and transferred the charter in 1964 from a free library association to a fully tax-supported public library and thus changed its name from the Briarcliff Free Library to the Briarcliff Manor Public Library.|$|E
5|$|Although the use {{of small}} private vessels for {{personal}} transport undoubtably extends back into prehistory, large ships capable of braving the open ocean were typically dedicated to trade or fishing for most of human history. Even military campaigns would often simply hire or commandeer these private fleets to serve as troop transports, as did the traders, pilgrims, and wealthy tourists of antiquity and the Middle Ages. The voyages of exploration and colonization were often provided for by the crown out of naval funds; where they were not, they were usually chartered or else purchased and then used for shipping supplies after the initial settlement. <b>Dedicated</b> <b>and</b> scheduled local passenger services came to be offered in the 16th and 17th centuries, but the 1817 Black Ball was the first trans-Atlantic passenger line. In the Age of Sail, the duration of such passages depended much on the prevailing winds and the weather. The 18th-century coastal Margate hoys began the popularization of leisure travel in Britain and Ireland that later gathered steam with Thomas Cook's package tours in the next century. During the 19th century, steam-powered ocean liners connected the railroad networks of the world. By 1900, the Atlantic crossing took about five days and the passenger lines competed to win the Blue Riband, an unofficial accolade accorded to the fastest liner in regular service. For twenty years from 1909, the prize went to the RMS Mauretania for its average speed of 26.06 knots (48.26km/h). This era waned as cheaper and faster intercontinental flights became available, most importantly the 1958 New York City–Paris route.|$|E

5|$|In late 1940, a southerly bypass of {{downtown}} Battle Creek opened. U.S. Highway12 (US12) was rerouted out {{of downtown}} to follow Columbia Avenue. The former route was redesignated Business US Highway12 (Bus. US12). In 1958 or 1959, {{a section of}} the route of Bus. US12 was split onto a one-way pairing of streets through downtown Battle Creek. On December 7, 1959, the southern I-94/US12 bypass of Battle Creek was <b>dedicated</b> <b>and</b> opened to traffic. The former routing of US12 along Columbia Avenue was turned over to local control and the route of Bus. US12 was extended via Michigan Avenue easterly and M-78 (Capitol Avenue) southerly to connect to the new freeway. Later the next year, this business loop was redesignated BL I-94. When the first segment of I-194 opened in 1961, BL I-94/M-78 was rerouted to follow the freeway. In 1964, the western end of the business loop was realigned to follow Dickman Road west to Fort Custer and south along Skyline Drive to I-94. The next year, as I-194 was completed and M-78 was replaced by an extended M-66, BL I-94 was rerouted through the downtown area. From Dickman Road, BL I-94 followed I-194/M-66 north {{to the end of the}} freeway at Hamblin Avenue and turned along Hamblin to Michigan Avenue via Jay Street. A minor realignment in 1970 shifted the connection between Hamblin and Michigan avenues. The one-way setup through downtown was removed in 1984. M-96 and M-37 were extended in 2000, running concurrently between Skyline Drive and the Helmer Road intersections. M-89 replaced part of M-37 but did not follow the latter's routing to I-994/M-66 near downtown. Then in 2008, BL I-94 was removed from the northern segment of I-194/M-66 freeway and rerouted to follow Dickman Road to Main Street back to Hamblin Avenue.|$|E
