25|$|The base is {{physically}} located between the emitter and the collector and {{is made from}} lightly doped, high-resistivity material. The collector surrounds the emitter region, making it almost impossible for the electrons injected into the base region to escape without being collected, thus making the resulting value of α very close to unity, and so, giving the transistor a large β.

25|$|Heterojunction {{transistors}} {{have different}} semiconductors for {{the elements of}} the transistor. Usually the emitter is composed of a larger bandgap material than the base. The figure shows that this difference in bandgap allows the barrier for holes to inject backward from the base into the emitter, denoted in the figure as Δφp, to be made large, while the barrier for electrons to inject into the base Δφn is made low. This barrier arrangement helps reduce minority carrier injection from the base when the <b>emitter-base</b> <b>junction</b> is under forward bias, and thus reduces base current and increases emitter injection efficiency.|$|E

25|$|The bipolar {{junction}} transistor, {{unlike other}} transistors, {{is usually not}} a symmetrical device. This means that interchanging the collector and the emitter makes the transistor leave the forward active mode and start to operate in reverse mode. Because the transistor's internal structure is usually optimized for forward-mode operation, interchanging the collector and the emitter makes the values of α and β in reverse operation much smaller than those in forward operation; often the α of the reverse mode is lower than 0.5. The lack of symmetry is primarily due to the doping ratios of the emitter and the collector. The emitter is heavily doped, while the collector is lightly doped, allowing a large reverse bias voltage to be applied before the collector–base junction breaks down. The collector–base junction is reverse biased in normal operation. The reason the emitter is heavily doped {{is to increase the}} emitter injection efficiency: the ratio of carriers injected by the emitter to those injected by the base. For high current gain, most of the carriers injected into the <b>emitter–base</b> <b>junction</b> must come from the emitter.|$|E

5000|$|On November 29, 1963 Dr. Biard, Gary Pittman, Edward L. Bonin, and Jack Kilby filed {{a patent}} titled [...] "Photosensitive Transistor Chopper Using Light Emissive Diode" [...] (U.S. Patent US3304431); the first optical isolator. Within the patent they {{described}} a phototransistor chopper consisting of an LED optically {{coupled with a}} dual emitter, photosensitive, silicon transistor. The arrangement provided a switching function in which the switch was completely electrically isolated from the LED that drove it. The transistor operated in response to light emitted from the LED when forward current bias was generated across the junction of the diode. When emitted light struck {{the surface of the}} transistor, it was absorbed in the regions of both the <b>emitter-base</b> and base-collector <b>junctions</b> causing the transistor to conduct. This photoconductive transistor could be rapidly turned on and off by intensity modulating the LED at a very high frequency using high frequency alternating voltage. Prior to their invention, complete electrical isolation of the switch element in a chopper from the driving source for opening and closing the switch element was not possible, even through use of isolation transformers. Using isolation transformers, which were bulky and expensive, in miniaturized circuits to separate the driving source and the switch element resulted in magnetic pick-up and spike feed-through due to the transformer winding capacitance. Optical isolators were ideal because they're very small and can be mounted to a circuit board. In addition, they offer protection against excessively high voltages, reduce noise levels, and make measurements more accurate. In March 1965, Texas Instruments announced the SNX1304 Optoelectronic Pulse Amplifier, which was conceived and developed by Dr. Biard and Jerry Merryman, the inventor of the first handheld digital calculator. The SNX1304 consisted of a GaAs p-n junction light emitter optically coupled to an integrated silicon photodetector feedback-amplifier circuit. The device is thought to be the first commercial optically coupled integrated circuit.|$|R
40|$|Two {{types of}} photodetectors {{containing}} Ge/Si quantum dots have been fabricated based on materials grown by {{molecular beam epitaxy}} and characterized with several experimental techniques. The aim was to study new device architectures {{with the implementation of}} Ge nanostructures, in order to obtain high detection efficiency in the near infrared range at room temperature. Heterojunction bipolar phototransistors were fabricated with 10 Ge dot layers in the base-collector (b-c) junction. With the illumination of near infrared radiation at 1. 31 to 1. 55 µm, the incident light would excite the carriers. The applied field across the b-c junction caused hole transport into the base, leading to a reduced potential barrier between the <b>emitter-base</b> (e-b) <b>junction.</b> Subsequently, this resulted in enhanced injection of electrons across the base into the collector, i. e., forming an amplified photo-induced current. We have therefore obtained significantly enhanced photo-response for the Ge-dot based phototransistors, compared to corresponding quantum dot p-i-n photodiodes. Responsivity values up to 470 mA/W were measured at 1. 31 µm using waveguide geometry, and ∼ 2. 5 A/W at 850 nm, while the dark current was as low as 0. 01 mA/cm 2 at – 2 V. Metal-oxide field-effect phototransistors were also studied. These lateral detectors were processed with three terminals for source, drain and gate contacts. The Ge quantum dot layers were sandwiched between pseudomorphically grown SiGe quantum wells. The detector devices were processed using a multi-finger comb structure with an isolated gate contact on top of each finger and patterned metal contacts on the side edges for source and drain. It was found that the photo-responsivity was increased by a factor of more than 20 when a proper gate bias was applied. With VG above threshold, the measured response was 350 and > 30 mA/W at 1. 31 and 1. 55 µm, respectively. Properties of Si/Si 1 -xGex nanostructures were examined, in order to facilitate proper design of the above mentioned transistor types of photodetectors. The carrier recombination processes were characterized by photoluminescence measurements, and the results revealed a gradual change from spatially indirect to direct transitions in type II Si 1 -xGex islands with increased measurement temperature. Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry of buried Ge islands produced at different temperatures indicated a gradual decrease of the Ge concentration with temperature, which was due to the enhanced intermixing of Si and Ge atoms. At a deposition temperature of 730 °C the Ge concentration was as low as around 40 %. Finally, the thermal stability of the Si/SiGe(110) material system, which is a promising candidate for future CMOS technology due to its high carrier mobility, was investigated by high resolution X-ray diffraction reciprocal space mapping. Anisotropic strain relaxation was observed with maximum in-plane lattice mismatch in the [001] direction.

50|$|In electronics, {{faithful}} amplification is the amplification of a signal, {{particularly a}} weak one, by a triode or a transistor {{such that the}} signal changes in amplitude but not in shape. In order to achieve this with a bipolar transistor, the transistor is biased. Faithful amplification can only occur on transistors with a forward biased <b>emitter-base</b> <b>junction,</b> a reverse biased collector-base junction, and proper zero signal collector current. Without the correct bias, the transistor will not operate efficiently and cause its output to distort.|$|E
50|$|Heterojunction {{transistors}} {{have different}} semiconductors for {{the elements of}} the transistor. Usually the emitter is composed of a larger bandgap material than the base. The figure shows that this difference in bandgap allows the barrier for holes to inject backward from the base into the emitter, denoted in the figure as Δφp, to be made large, while the barrier for electrons to inject into the base Δφn is made low. This barrier arrangement helps reduce minority carrier injection from the base when the <b>emitter-base</b> <b>junction</b> is under forward bias, and thus reduces base current and increases emitter injection efficiency.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} {{difference between}} the BJT and HBT is {{in the use of}} differing semiconductor materials for the <b>emitter-base</b> <b>junction</b> and the base-collector junction, creating a heterojunction. The effect is to limit the injection of holes from the base into the emitter region, since the potential barrier in the valence band is higher than in the conduction band. Unlike BJT technology, this allows a high doping density {{to be used in the}} base, reducing the base resistance while maintaining gain. The efficiency of the heterojunction is measured by the Kroemer factor, named after Herbert Kroemer who was awarded a Nobel Prize in 2000 for his work in this field at the University of California, Santa Barbara.|$|E
5000|$|The {{junction}} {{forward voltage}} is the voltage {{applied to the}} <b>emitter-base</b> <b>junction</b> of a BJT {{in order to make}} the base conduct a specified current. The current increases exponentially as the junction forward voltage is increased. The values given in the table are typical for a current of 1 mA (the same values apply to semiconductor diodes). The lower the junction forward voltage the better, as this means that less power is required to [...] "drive" [...] the transistor. The junction forward voltage for a given current decreases with increase in temperature. For a typical silicon junction the change is −2.1 mV/°C. In some circuits special compensating elements (sensistors) must be used to compensate for such changes.|$|E
50|$|A speedy {{switching}} device is an NPN avalanche transistor {{fitted with a}} coil between base and emitter. The transistor is initially switched off and about 300 volts exists across its collector-base junction. This voltage is high enough that a charge carrier in this region can create more carriers by impact ionisation, but the probability is too low to form a proper avalanche; instead a somewhat noisy leakage current flows. When the preceding stage switches, the <b>emitter-base</b> <b>junction</b> is pushed into forward bias and the collector-base junction enters full avalanche mode, so charge carriers injected into the collector-base region multiply in a chain reaction. Once the Marx generator has completely fired, voltages everywhere drop, each switch avalanche stops, its matched coil puts its base-emitter junction into reverse bias, and the low static field allows remaining charge carriers to drain out of its collector-base junction.|$|E
50|$|BJTs {{have three}} terminals, {{corresponding}} to the three layers of semiconductor—an emitter, a base, and a collector. They are useful in amplifiers because the currents at the emitter and collector are controllable by a relatively small base current. In an n-p-n transistor operating in the active region, the <b>emitter-base</b> <b>junction</b> is forward biased (electrons and holes recombine at the junction), and electrons are injected into the base region. Because the base is narrow, most of these electrons will diffuse into the reverse-biased (electrons and holes are formed at, and {{move away from the}} junction) base-collector junction and be swept into the collector; perhaps one-hundredth of the electrons will recombine in the base, which is the dominant mechanism in the base current. By controlling the number of electrons that can leave the base, the number of electrons entering the collector can be controlled. Collector current is approximately β (common-emitter current gain) times the base current. It is typically greater than 100 for small-signal transistors but can be smaller in transistors designed for high-power applications.|$|E
50|$|The bipolar {{junction}} transistor, {{unlike other}} transistors, {{is usually not}} a symmetrical device. This means that interchanging the collector and the emitter makes the transistor leave the forward active mode and start to operate in reverse mode. Because the transistor's internal structure is usually optimized for forward-mode operation, interchanging the collector and the emitter makes the values of α and β in reverse operation much smaller than those in forward operation; often the α of the reverse mode is lower than 0.5. The lack of symmetry is primarily due to the doping ratios of the emitter and the collector. The emitter is heavily doped, while the collector is lightly doped, allowing a large reverse bias voltage to be applied before the collector-base junction breaks down. The collector-base junction is reverse biased in normal operation. The reason the emitter is heavily doped {{is to increase the}} emitter injection efficiency: the ratio of carriers injected by the emitter to those injected by the base. For high current gain, most of the carriers injected into the <b>emitter-base</b> <b>junction</b> must come from the emitter.|$|E
50|$|The <b>emitter-base</b> <b>junction</b> of a bipolar NPN {{transistor}} behaves as a Zener diode, with {{breakdown voltage}} at about 6.8 V for common bipolar processes and about 10 V for lightly doped base regions in BiCMOS processes. Older processes with poor control of doping characteristics had the variation of Zener voltage up to ±1 V, newer processes using ion implantation can achieve no more than ±0.25 V. The NPN transistor structure can be employed as a surface Zener diode, with collector and emitter connected together as its cathode and base region as anode. In this approach the base doping profile usually narrows towards the surface, creating a region with intensified electric field where the avalanche breakdown occurs. The hot carriers produced by acceleration in the intense field sometime shoot into the oxide layer above the junction and become trapped there. The accumulation of trapped charges can then cause 'Zener walkout', a corresponding change of the Zener voltage of the junction. The same effect {{can be achieved by}} radiation damage.|$|E
