Among the changes from the CFM56-5A is the option of a double-annular combustor that reduces emissions (particularly NOx), a new fan in a longer fan case, and a new low-pressure compressor with a fourth stage (up from three in earlier variants). <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> numerous engine supplied to Airbus.|$|E
