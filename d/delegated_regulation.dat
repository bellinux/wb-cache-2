40|$|Energy Efficiency in Buildings {{has been}} gaining {{increasing}} relevance in the past decades due to the raise of the energy consumption in the building sector {{as a consequence of}} the modern way of living with higher comfort patterns. In Europe, buildings are responsible for 40 % of the energy consumption, which turns them into an important target for carbon emissions’ reduction [1]. Energy efficiency should be a main concern not only in new buildings, but also in the existing ones, which have poor energy performances. In Portugal most of the building stock was built before 1990, date of entrance into force of the first thermal regulation. Therefore, most of these buildings need intervention to improve not only the living environment, but also their energy performances. To evaluate the best measures, that fulfil the minimum requirements established for the energy needs with the lowest costs, the European Commission released the Commission <b>Delegated</b> <b>Regulation</b> (EU) Nº 244 / 2012 that establishes a comparative methodology framework for calculating the cost-optimal level for minimum energy performance. In order to verify the renovation potential of these buildings, based on the <b>Delegated</b> <b>Regulation</b> methodology and taking advantage of a renovation process in course, a social housing neighbourhood called Rainha Dona Leonor was analysed.

Secondly, delegation may be {{a response to the}} political uncertainty problem, which arises when governments are afraid of being replaced by another coalition with different preferences, which could decide to change existing policy choices.

50|$|In {{addition}} to the parliament, the Cabinet and President may produce regulations (asetus) through a rulemaking process.

Regulations must be based on an existing law, and they can clarify and specify, but not contradict the statute. Furthermore, the rights of an individual must always be based on a statute, not a regulation. Often the statute and the regulation come in similarly named pairs. For example, the law on primary education lists the subjects to the taught, and the regulation specifies the required number of teaching hours. Most of regulations are given by the Cabinet, but the President may give regulations concerning national security. Before 2000, the President had the right to enact regulations on matters not governed by parliamentary law, but this power was removed, and existing regulations were converted into regular statutes by the Parliament.|$|R

Our analysis of those regimes suggests three main findings.

To promote buildings energy renovation, the European Committee (2010) [1] asks Member States to define retrofit strategies finding cost-effective solutions. This so-called cost-optimal approach, described by the Commission <b>Delegated</b> <b>Regulation</b> EU (European Commission, 2012) [2], pursues a balance of energy and economic targets, but currently neglects some important aspects, such as indoor thermal comfort. This research investigates {{the relationship between the}} initial characteristics of residential buildings and the definition of optimal retrofit solutions in terms of either maximum economic performance, or energy consumption minimization towards nZEBs behaviour for the lowest achievable thermal discomfort. A multi-objective optimization has been carried out using a genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) coupled with a dynamic simulation tool. The results demonstrate that (i) with conventional Energy Efficiency Measures, it is possible to approach the zero energy target maintaining the economical convenience but worsening the indoor thermal comfort and that (ii) there is the necessity to introduce incentives to foster solutions not economically profitable, but more efficient in terms of energy savings and indoor thermal comfort...|$|E

40|$|More than 30 % of the Italian {{schools have}} very low energy {{efficiency}} due to aging or poor quality of construction. The current European policy on energy saving, with the Commission <b>Delegated</b> <b>Regulation</b> (EU) 244 / 2012, recommends a cost-optimal analysis of retrofit improvements, starting from some reference buildings. One relevant {{issue is the}} definition of a set of reference buildings effectively representative of the considered stock. A possible solution could be found using data mining techniques, such as the K-means clustering method, which allows the division of a large sample into more homogeneous and small groups. This work adopts the cluster analysis to find out a few school buildings representative of a sample of about 60 schools in the province of Treviso, North-East of Italy, thus reducing the number of buildings to be analyzed in detail to optimize the energy retrofit measures. Real consumption data of the scholastic year 2011 – 2012 were correlated to buildings characteristics through regression and the parameters with the highest correlation with energy consumption levels used in cluster analysis to group schools.

A duty to provide first aid is stricter for the healthcare professionals and unlike laymen they cannot withdraw from this obligation even in life or health threatening situations.

40|$|The EPBD recast (2010 / 31 /EC) {{established}} that Member States (MSs) {{must ensure that}} minimum energy performance (EP) requirements for buildings are set "with a view to achieve cost-optimal levels". The Guidelines accompanying Commission <b>Delegated</b> <b>Regulation</b> established a comparative methodology framework for calculating cost-optimal levels of minimum EP requirements for buildings and building elements. MSs are required to identify reference buildings, to define energy efficiency measures (EEMs), to assess the final and primary energy need of the reference buildings {{before and after the}} application of the different EEMs, and finally to calculate the costs of the EEMs during the expected economic life cycle. The present work is focused on the application of the EC comparative methodology for a residential reference building in Italy. The aim is to verify the effectiveness of the methodology to achieve the cost-optimal levels of EP for buildings as to maximize the net present value of EEMs. A new cost optimization procedure is proposed based on a sequential searchoptimization technique. The method considers discrete building energy efficiency options (e. g. different levels of insulation), which are applied one at a time in order to find at each step a new partial optimal building.

In Italy the cost optimal methodology has been performed by using a simulation tool enforced on a quasi-steady state numerical model (UNI/TS 11300) while the cost optimisation procedure is based on a sequential search-optimisation technique considering discrete options, as introduced in a previous work. Packages of energy efficiency measures giving optimal EP levels have been found for different buildings and climatic conditions. Results show that the optimal solutions are strongly influenced by energy costs of the different energy wares, and this can affect the suitable technical solutions for refurbishment. The present work is focused on the definition of different economic scenarios. The aim is to assess a wide economic framework as to determine the influence of the energy cost and discount rate on the costs/benefits analysis and how cost optimal solutions can change according to these trends. Different energy cost variations are considered for electricity and natural gas, which are the most used energy carriers in Italy. The economic framework is applied to four Italian reference buildings to emphasize its influence when different building uses and climatic boundary conditions are considered.

40|$|Nearly Zero-Energy Buildings (nZEBs) have {{received}} increased attention {{in recent years}} as a result of constant concerns for energy supply constraints, decreasing energy resources, increasing energy costs and rising impact of greenhouse gases on world climate. The EPBD recast directive [1] requests all new buildings to meet higher levels of performance than before, by exploring more the alternative energy supply systems available locally on a cost-efficiency basis and without prejudicing the occupants' comfort. To this end, after 2020, all new buildings should become "nearly zero-energy" and after 31 December 2018, the same requirement is applied for new buildings occupied and owned by public authorities. Furthermore, the EPBD recast states that MS must ensure that minimum energy performance requirements for buildings are set with a view to achieving cost-optimal levels according to the Commission <b>Delegated</b> <b>Regulation</b> (EU) No 244 / 2012 of 16 January 2012.
