5|$|Bald eagles, ospreys, kingfishers, brook trout, and {{freshwater}} molluscs {{have all}} been observed on the tributaries Hammersley <b>Fork</b> <b>and</b> Trout Run. Bald eagles, ospreys, Canada geese, herons, and mallard ducks have visited Kettle Creek Lake. Various birds of prey have also temporarily visited the watershed. Ring-necked pheasants and ruffed grouse live in the watershed.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the three main-stem gauges, the USGS operates five other stream gauges in the Bull Run watershed. Each of the following tributaries has one gauge: Fir Creek, Blazed Alder Creek, the North Fork, the South <b>Fork,</b> <b>and</b> the Little Sandy.|$|E
5|$|On a {{domestic}} scale, the spade, <b>fork,</b> <b>and</b> hoe are {{the tools of}} choice while on commercial farms a range of mechanical equipment is available. Besides tractors, these include ploughs, harrows, drills, transplanters, cultivators, irrigation equipment, and harvesters. New techniques are changing the cultivation procedures involved in growing vegetables with computer monitoring systems, GPS locators, and self-steer programs for driverless machines giving economic benefits.|$|E

5|$|The Pend Oreille River system (including {{its main}} tributaries, the Clark <b>Fork</b> <b>and</b> Flathead rivers) is also similar {{in size to}} the Columbia at their confluence.

5|$|The named tributaries {{within the}} {{watershed}} are presented here in three lists. Larrys Creek itself has 18 named tributaries, {{which are the}} subject of the first list. The First <b>Fork</b> <b>and</b> Second Fork of Larrys Creek are the two main tributaries of Larrys Creek, and they have multiple tributaries of their own. The second list gives the First Fork's eight named tributaries, and the third list gives the Second Fork's nine named tributaries. Finally there are seven named streams in the watershed which are tributaries of tributaries of the three main branches, and they are presented after each list. There is one such stream for Larrys Creek itself, two for the First <b>Fork,</b> <b>and</b> four for the Second Fork. There are also tributaries without names, which are not included in these lists.|$|E

5|$|A mile east of Highway 133, {{the valley}} floor widens, filled with farms and subdivisions as the road gently trends to the south. Five miles (8km) east of Carbondale, Highway 82 crosses into Eagle County.

A {{mile and a half}} after that Highway 82 crosses the Roaring <b>Fork</b> <b>and</b> then enters Pitkin County at the small unincorporated community of Emma.|$|E
5|$|Although {{bicycles}} and motorcycles can {{appear to be}} simple mechanisms with only four major moving parts (frame, <b>fork,</b> <b>and</b> two wheels), these parts are arranged {{in a way that}} makes them complicated to analyze. While it is an observable fact that bikes can be ridden even when the gyroscopic effects of their wheels are canceled out, the hypothesis that the gyroscopic effects of the wheels are what keep a bike upright is common in print and online.|$|E
5|$|Fishing, four-wheel driving, swimming, boating, camping, sightseeing, and picnicking are {{the primary}} {{recreational}} activities in the watershed.

Eight boat launches are located on the river between its confluence with the south <b>fork</b> <b>and</b> its mouth. Alfred A.

5|$|Homologous {{recombination}} {{requires the}} presence of an identical or nearly identical sequence {{to be used as a}} template for repair of the break. The enzymatic machinery responsible for this repair process is nearly identical to the machinery responsible for chromosomal crossover during meiosis. This pathway allows a damaged chromosome to be repaired using a sister chromatid (available in G2 after DNA replication) or a homologous chromosome as a template. DSBs caused by the replication machinery attempting to synthesize across a single-strand break or unrepaired lesion cause collapse of the replication <b>fork</b> <b>and</b> are typically repaired by recombination.|$|E
5|$|In {{the upper}} reaches of Kettle Creek, the tributaries Billings Branch, Sliders Branch, Germania Branch, and Long Run flow into the creek, in that order. They all enter Kettle Creek roughly from the north. In the middle reaches of Kettle Creek, Little Kettle Creek, Cross <b>Fork,</b> <b>and</b> Hammersley Fork flow into the creek from the north, in that order. Further downstream, Trout Run, Walters Run and Beaverdam Run enter the creek from the {{northwest}} and Hevner Run and Spicewood Run enter it from the east. Near Kettle Creek's mouth, Twomile Run enters it from the northeast.|$|E
5|$|Motorcycle {{engineer}} Norbert Riedel {{recognized the}} need for a simple and economical light motorcycle during Germany's recovery from the Second World War and began to design one. By the summer of 1947, a prototype frame had been built and tested. The spine frame was made from 40mm steel tubing, as were the steering head, the single-sided front <b>fork,</b> <b>and</b> the single-sided swingarm. The wheels were interchangeable, and were mounted from the left on stub axles attached to the suspension on the right.|$|E

5|$|State Route 190 {{begins at}} State Route 99 {{just south of}} {{downtown}} Tipton in Tulare County and heads straight east along the flat San Joaquin Valley on Avenue 144. There is a short expressway segment in Porterville, including a cloverleaf interchange at State Route 65 and a partial interchange at Main Street, after which the highway begins to curve alongside the Tule River, passing {{the south side of}} Lake Success, as the terrain becomes more rugged. Following the river, it meets the south end of County Route J37, an access road to Balch Park in the Mountain Home State Forest, at the forks of the river near the community of Springville. SR 190 continues east near the Middle <b>Fork</b> <b>and</b> South Fork Middle Fork Tule River to near Camp Nelson, where it begins rising into the foothills, going around many hairpin turns in order to rise to Quaking Aspen, the source of the South Fork Middle <b>Fork</b> <b>and</b> the end of the western segment of SR 190. The county-maintained Western Divide Highway continues south to a point west of Johnsondale, where traffic can turn east to reach US 395 via Sherman Pass and County Route J41.|$|E
5|$|The United States Geological Survey {{monitored}} {{the flow of}} Little Butte Creek at seven different stream gauges: two on the south fork, three on the north <b>fork,</b> <b>and</b> two on the main stem. The first opened in 1908 at the newly constructed Fish Lake Dam on the north fork, while the last opened in 1927 near the Big Elk Ranger Station on the south fork. By 1989, all seven were closed. The data recorded by the lowermost gauges of both forks and the main stem are listed below.|$|E

5|$|The United States Geological Survey {{monitors}} {{the flow of}} Big Butte Creek at three different stream gauges: two on the South <b>Fork,</b> <b>and</b> one on the main stem. Both South Fork gauges were shut down in 1991, but the gauge located {{near the mouth of}} Big Butte Creek continues to operate. The main stem often discharges less water than the South Fork alone in the summer months because of numerous diversions.|$|E
5|$|When US-89 {{was created}} in 1926, it only went {{as far north as}} Spanish Fork, where {{travelers}} could continue to Salt Lake City via US-91. The highway was extended north to the Canada–US border near Glacier National Park in the mid-1930s, though a dispute between Utah and Idaho on the one side and Wyoming on the other was not settled until 1938. The American Association of State Highway Officials decided in favor of Utah and Idaho, placing US-89 on or near US-91 between Spanish <b>Fork</b> <b>and</b> Logan, where it split northeasterly to Yellowstone National Park. (US-89 only left US-91 twice: between Farmington and Ogden, where it still travels today, and via an all-weather route from Brigham City into the Cache Valley, now SR-38 and SR-30.) Wyoming's preferred routing, which left US-91 at Provo, instead became US-189. Beginning in the 1950s, Interstate 15 was constructed, replacing US-91 for through traffic south of Brigham City, and leading to that route's truncation there in 1974. On the other hand, US-89 follows independent corridors south of Spanish <b>Fork</b> <b>and</b> north of Logan. It has not been truncated, and mostly follows US-91's final alignment, except between Farmington and Ogden (where old US-91 is now I-15, SR-126, and SR-26).|$|E
