500|$|Soon after, Olivia {{attended}} a showing of The Land of Heart's Desire, {{and found herself}} moved by the performance. She wanted to meet the [...] "tall and black haired" [...] poet and asked Johnson to invite Yeats to tea on 10May1894, adding in her handwriting to the invitation, [...] "I shall be {{so glad to see}} you". In his Memoirs Yeats referred to her as [...] "Diana Vernon", writing, [...] "In this book I cannot giver her real name—Diana Vernon sounds pleasantly <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>ears</b> and will suit as well as any other".|$|E
500|$|Elgar {{was another}} {{composer}} who had cause {{to be grateful}} to Boult. His Second Symphony had, since its premiere nine years earlier, received few performances. When Boult conducted it at the Queen's Hall in March 1920 to [...] "great applause" [...] and [...] "frantic enthusiasm", the composer wrote to him: [...] "With the sounds ringing <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>ears</b> I send a word of thanks for your splendid conducting of the Sym.... I feel that my reputation {{in the future is}} safe in your hands." [...] Elgar's friend and biographer, the violinist W. H. Reed, wrote that Boult's performance of Elgar's neglected work brought [...] "the grandeur and nobility of the work" [...] to wider public attention.|$|E

500|$|The band {{also used}} {{instruments}} {{that did not}} appear on previous albums, such as horns and violins. The members became more open to experimentation, but attempted to not over-produce the album; Stump stated that he [...] "had {{to resist the temptation}} to use a lot of strings." [...] "Golden" [...] consists exclusively of vocals and piano, and Stump dubbed the song [...] "much softer than anything we’ve ever done". The group utilizes a full horn section on [...] "I've Got All This Ringing <b>in</b> <b>My</b> <b>Ears</b> and None on My Fingers", a track which has been likened to Queen. Violins are used on both [...] "Thnks fr th Mmrs", in addition to an acoustic guitar strummed flamenco-style, and [...] "The (After) Life of the Party", which also features electronic-influenced sounds. Commenting on the instruments used on [...] "Thnks fr th Mmrs", Stump stated [...] "I never thought I'd get a euphonium onto a Fall Out Boy record". [...] "You're Crashing, But You're No Wave" [...] features a gospel choir, while [...] "Thriller" [...] contains a spoken-word intro from Jay-Z. Barry Nicolson of NME referred to the song as a [...] "towering, Foo Fighters-esque slice of thunderous rhythm and radio-friendly melody." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{some critics}} {{felt that the}} album was overly ambitious and that the band's musical {{departure}} may alienate listeners. Chad Grischow of IGN felt that the album's dramatic hooks seem [...] "bloated" [...] at times: [...] "The band does a great of focusing on what they do best, but the album does drown itself a bit with all the overwhelming enormity of it all." [...] Scott Shetler of Slant disliked the [...] "melodramatic" [...] undertones of [...] "I've Got All This Ringing <b>in</b> <b>My</b> <b>Ears</b> and None on My Fingers" [...] and [...] "Golden", writing [...] "they don't handle that style quite as well as Panic! at the Disco". Cory Apar of AllMusic opined that the album's pop direction contradicts the band's lyrical claims of wishing to stick to their roots. He called the album's various styles [...] "hit and miss", yet commented that [...] "Once Infinity on High sinks in, it's indeed a fun record. But for a band that was once so self-assured and able to utilize its talents so compellingly, the album is regrettably haphazard." [...] Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian believed that the album was overly sullen, but noted that [...] "They may not be happy, but they haven't forgotten to be catchy." [...] Barry Nicholson of NME found the amount of guest producers to be unnecessary and disliked some of the songs, but admired the album's [...] "infectious" [...] nature.|$|E

2500|$|Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice {{was eight}} {{years old at the time}} of the bombing and both a classmate and friend of Carol Denise McNair. On the day of the bombing, Rice was at her father's church, located a few blocks from the 16th Street Baptist Church. In 2004, Rice {{recalled}} her memories of the bombing: I remembered the bombing of that Sunday School at 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham in 1963. I did not see it happen, but I heard it happen and I felt it happen, just a few blocks away at my father's church. It is a sound that I will never forget, that will forever reverberate <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>ears.</b> That bomb took the lives of four young girls, including my friend and playmate [...] Denise McNair. The crime was calculated, not random. It was meant to suck the hope out of young lives, bury their aspirations, and ensure that old fears would be propelled forward into the next generation.|$|E
2500|$|Three months later, Texarkana Gazette {{reporter}} Lucille Holland {{was flown}} to Frederick {{by a man}} named Paul Burns to interview her. By the time of the interview, officers had not publicly linked Larey's attack with the recent murders. The report appeared in the May 10 edition of the Texarkana Gazette. Larey said [...] "I would know his voice anywhere. It rings always <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>ears.</b> Why didn't he kill me too? He killed so many others." [...] She described her attacker as a light-skinned black man, which was different from Hollis' belief that he was a dark-tanned white man. After the first double murder, Larey went to Texarkana to talk to the police in hopes they would connect the incidents and help identify the murderer, but the Rangers questioned her and insisted she knew who her attacker was. After the second double murder, a Texas Ranger went to Frederick to question her again. Larey, native to Oklahoma, died in Billings, Montana of cancer in 1965 at the age of 38.|$|E
2500|$|I mounted, therefore, unbidden, the Bed stead – & M. Dubois placed me {{upon the}} Mattress, & spread a cambric {{handkerchief}} upon my face. It was transparent, however, & I saw, through it, that the Bed stead was instantly {{surrounded by the}} 7 men & my nurse. I refused to be held; but when, Bright through the cambric, I saw the glitter of polished Steel – [...] I closed my Eyes. I would not trust to convulsive fear {{the sight of the}} terrible incision. Yet – when the dreadful steel was plunged into the breast – cutting through veins – arteries – flesh – nerves – I needed no injunctions not to restrain my cries. I began a scream that lasted unintermittingly during the whole time of the incision – & I almost marvel that it rings not <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>Ears</b> still? so excruciating was the agony. When the wound was made, & the instrument was withdrawn, the pain seemed undiminished, for the air that suddenly rushed into those delicate parts felt like a mass of minute but sharp & forked poniards, that were tearing the edges of the wound. I concluded the operation was over – Oh no! presently the terrible cutting was renewed – & worse than ever, to separate the bottom, the foundation of this dreadful gland from the parts to which it adhered – Again all description would be baffled – yet again all was not over, – Dr. Larry rested but his own hand, & – Oh heaven! – I then felt the knife (rack)ling against the breast bone – scraping it! ...|$|E
