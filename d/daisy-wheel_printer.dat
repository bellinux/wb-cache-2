5000|$|... #Caption: The Royal LetterMaster, {{a budget}} <b>daisy-wheel</b> <b>printer</b> from the 1980s ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{dot matrix}} printer had a sheet feed for short {{documents}} and a tractor attachment for long reports on continuous stationery. [...] This unit could print 90 characters per second at draft quality and 20 characters per second at higher quality, and could also produce graphics. However it had only 9 printing pins and even its higher quality did not match that of 24-pin printers. The {{dot matrix printer}} was not very robust as its chassis was made entirely of plastic. Users who needed to support higher print volumes or to produce graphics could buy a <b>daisy-wheel</b> <b>printer</b> or graph plotter from Amstrad. The <b>daisy-wheel</b> <b>printer</b> could not produce graphics.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{issues of}} Garden Railways (GR) were {{published}} in black-and-white. Text was generated on a typewriter. In 1985, a primitive IBM computer and a <b>daisy-wheel</b> <b>printer</b> were acquired, which allowed text to be printed out in justified columns. These columns, printed out in strips, were then pasted up by hand in the old-fashion way.|$|E
50|$|Standard Centronics {{parallel}} interface allows connection of {{a multitude of}} different types of printer from very cheap thermal types to high speed matrix printers or word processors quality <b>daisy-wheel</b> <b>printers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most <b>daisy-wheel</b> <b>printers</b> could print a {{line and}} then, using {{built-in}} memory, print the following line backwards, from right to left. This saved the time that {{otherwise would have been}} needed to return the print head to its starting point.|$|R
50|$|The printer {{became so}} common, {{with so much}} {{software}} supporting its command language, that Diablo emulation became an expected feature on other <b>daisy-wheel</b> <b>printers</b> and even on early laser printers. This was so pervasive {{that at least one}} company lived by testing printers for full Diablo 630 compatibility.|$|R
50|$|Figure 2: Dual floppy {{diskette}} drives are to {{the right}} of a full-page cathode ray tube (CRT) display screen. The broad horizontal bar on the screen is an after-image of the lower editing window, which almost always contained text and which after years of editing left an impression on the screen's luminescent phosphors. A <b>daisy-wheel</b> <b>printer</b> was a separate cable-connected device, not shown.|$|E
5000|$|Early {{personal}} computer software {{focused on the}} processing of text, but as graphics displays became ubiquitous throughout the {{personal computer}} world, users wanted to print both text and images. Ironically, whereas the <b>daisy-wheel</b> <b>printer</b> and pen-plotter struggled to reproduce bitmap images, the first dot-matrix impact printers (including the MX-80) lacked the ability to print graphics. Yet the dot-matrix print head was well-suited to this task, and the capability, referred to as [...] "dot-addressable" [...] quickly became a standard feature on all dot-matrix printers intended for the personal and home computer markets. In 1981, Epson offered a retrofit EPROM kit called Graftrax to add the capability to many early MX series printers. Banners and signs produced with software that used this ability, such as Broderbund's Print Shop, became ubiquitous in offices and schools throughout the 1980s.|$|E
5000|$|In June 1978, the Epson TX-80/TP-80, an 8-pin {{dot-matrix printer}} mainly {{used for the}} Commodore PET computer, was released. This and its successor, the 9-pin Epson MX-80/MP-80 (introduced in 1979/1980), were the {{groundbreaking}} models that sparked the initial popularity of impact printers in the personal computer market. The MX-80 combined affordability with good-quality text output (for its time). Early impact printers (including the MX) were notoriously loud during operation, {{a result of the}} hammer-like mechanism in the print head. The MX-80 even inspired the name of a noise rock band. The MX-80's low dot density (60 dpi horizontal, 72 dpi vertical) produced printouts of a distinctive [...] "computerized" [...] quality. When compared to the crisp typewriter quality of a <b>daisy-wheel</b> <b>printer,</b> the dot-matrix printer's legibility appeared especially bad. In office applications, output quality was a serious issue, as the dot-matrix text's readability would rapidly degrade with each photocopy generation. IBM sold the MX-80 as IBM 5152.|$|E
50|$|Daisy Systems Holland BV was a Dutch {{manufacturer}} of <b>daisy-wheel</b> <b>printers</b> (hence the name), later expanded into other printer technologies: inkjet, dot matrix, and laser. Headquartered in Wijchen, it was acquired in 1987 from its Canadian parent AES Data, by Jan Cornelisse, the then {{managing director of}} Daisy Systems, who became its majority shareholder. In 1980s it {{claimed to be the}} largest specialist printer company in Europe. The company was formed in 1977 after its predecessor company went bankrupt.|$|R
50|$|Qume was a {{manufacturer}} of <b>daisy-wheel</b> <b>printers</b> originally located in Hayward, California, later moving to San Jose. Around 1980, it also opened a manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico. It once dominated the daisy-wheel market. As the market for its printers declined in the 1980s, the company developed a line of computer terminals. It was founded by David S. Lee in 1973 and was a division of ITT Corporation from 1978 until its acquisition by Wyse Technology sometime before 1995.|$|R
50|$|Scripsit is a {{rudimentary}} word processor. It has basic text entry and margin controls, {{as well as}} word wrap. Many versions tied to specific platforms were available, and each version had {{its own set of}} features. Most versions supported variable width fonts, specifically for <b>daisy-wheel</b> <b>printers.</b> None had support for graphics other than some character macros depending on the version. The version for the TRS-80 Model I had special handling to make it possible to use lowercase letters, even though the hardware itself did not support mixed-case type.|$|R
5000|$|The BASIC {{statement}} [...] {{prepares a}} device for I/O access: REM Opens the cassette device on channel 1 for reading in BASIC OPEN #1,4,0,"C:MYPROG.DAT"Here, [...] means [...] "ensure channel 1 is free," [...] call the [...] driver {{to prepare the}} device (this will set the cassette tape spools onto tension and advance the heads keeping the cassette tape player [...] "paused." [...] The [...] means [...] "read" [...] (other codes are [...] for write and [...] for [...] "read-and-write"). The third number is auxiliary information, set to 0 when not needed. The [...] {{is the name of}} the device and the filename; the filename is ignored for the cassette driver. Physical devices can have numbers (mainly disks, printers and serial devices), so [...] "P1:" [...] might be the plotter and [...] "P2:" [...] the <b>daisy-wheel</b> <b>printer,</b> or [...] "D1:" [...] may be one disk drive and [...] "D2:" [...] and so on. If not present, 1 is assumed.|$|E
5000|$|Letter-quality impact printers, however, were slow, noisy, {{incapable}} of printing graphics or images (unless the programmable microspacing and over-use of the dot were employed), sometimes limited to monochrome, and {{limited to a}} fixed set (usually one) of typefaces without operator intervention, though certain font effects like underlining and boldface could be achieved by overstriking. Soon, dot-matrix printers (such as the Oki Microline 84) would offer [...] "Near Letter Quality" [...] (NLQ) modes which were much faster than <b>daisy-wheel</b> <b>printers,</b> could produce graphics well, but were still very noticeably lower than [...] "letter quality". Nowadays, printers using non-impact printing (for example laser printers, inkjet printers, and other similar means) have replaced traditional letter-quality printers in most applications. The quality of inkjet printers can approach the old letter-quality impact printers (but can be limited by factors such as paper type).|$|R
50|$|MultiMate was {{especially}} good at supporting {{a variety of}} PC clones and hundreds of computer printers, each of which required its own printer driver. Such printer support was very strong with <b>daisy-wheel</b> and dot-matrix <b>printers,</b> but did not take much advantage {{of the development of}} PostScript fonts and laser printers.|$|R
