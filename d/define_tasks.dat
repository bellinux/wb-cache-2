30|$|SRL is {{an active}} and {{constructive}} process through which learners can set goals and monitor and control their cognition, motivation, and behavior (Pintrich 2000). It is also characterized as a self-directive process, as self-beliefs enable learners to transform their academic abilities (Zimmerman 2008). Winne and Hadwin (1998) proposed that SRL included four phases: defining the task, setting goals and plans, enacting tactics, and adapting metacognition. Therefore, learners need to analyze the learning context and <b>define</b> <b>tasks,</b> set the appropriate learning goals and make plans, select the effective learning strategies to use, monitor the whole learning process, and evaluate their learning performance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Motivated by {{the plethora}} of book {{digitization}} projects around the world, the Initiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval (INEX) launched a Book Search track in 2007. The track focused on Information Retrieval (IR) tasks, exploring the utility of traditional and structured document retrieval techniques to books. In this paper, we propose four new tasks to be investigated at the Book Search track. The tasks aim to promote research in a wider context across IR, Human Computer Interaction, Digital Libraries and eBooks. We identify novel problem areas, <b>define</b> <b>tasks</b> around these and propose possible evaluation methods. ...|$|E

40|$|Defining requirements, missions, technologies, and {{concepts}} for space exploration involves multiple levels of organizations, teams {{of people with}} complementary skills, and analytical models and simulations. Analytical activities range from filling a To-Be-Determined (TBD) in a requirement to creating animations and simulations of exploration missions. In a program as large as returning to the Moon, {{there are hundreds of}} simultaneous analysis activities. A way to manage and integrate efforts of this magnitude is to deploy a centralized database that provides the capability to <b>define</b> <b>tasks,</b> identify resources, describe products, schedule deliveries, and generate a variety of reports. This paper describes a web-accessible task management system and explains the lessons learned during the development and deployment of the database. Through the database, managers and team leaders can <b>define</b> <b>tasks,</b> establish review schedules, assign teams, link tasks to specific requirements, identify products, and link the task data records to external repositories that contain the products. Data filters and spreadsheet export utilities provide a powerful capability to create custom reports. Import utilities provide a means to populate the database from previously filled form files. Within a four month period, a small team analyzed requirements, developed a prototype, conducted multiple system demonstrations, and deployed a working system supporting hundreds of users across the aeros pace community. Open-source technologies and agile software development techniques, applied by a skilled team enabled this impressive achievement. Topics in the paper cover the web application technologies, agile software development, an overview of the system's functions and features, dealing with increasing scope, and deploying new versions of the system...|$|E

40|$|Confrontation naming has {{frequently}} been administered to Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients {{as a measure}} of the integrity of semantic memory. Recent evidence, however, suggests that naming may be possible without access to semantic information.

Ninety-nine mild and moderately demented AD patients and 51 elderly controls were asked to both name and define the same stimulus items. Many instances of preservation of the ability to name and not define, or define and not name, were observed. These findings suggest that confrontation naming alone is an inaccurate measure of semantic memory.
