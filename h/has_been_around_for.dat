25|$|The art of {{crafting}} objects out of silver, {{also known}} as silversmithing, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> centuries. With the creation of hand-made silver objects, the issue of cleaning and caring for these items were a concern. Silversmiths would give advice to clients on how to properly care for their silver. Here are examples of instructions given by silversmiths in the 17th and 18th Century.|$|E
25|$|Fake Patty's Day – Every Year, {{usually a}} week or two before St. Patrick's Day, Aggieville becomes a scene of festivity, celebrating 'Fake Patty's Day'. The event <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> many years, and was adopted by the {{licensed}} venues of Aggieville to avoid missing out on revenue garnered from St. Patrick's Day, which usually falls on the weekend before or during spring break.|$|E

Examples have been found that are believed to depict extinct megafauna such as Genyornis and Thylacoleo as well as more recent historical events such as the arrival of European ships. Is not often seen today.|$|E
25|$|In 2016 Volcanologists with Natural Resources Canada {{monitored}} Mount Meager {{after discovering}} that the mountain {{shows signs of}} low-level volcanic activity. The biggest risk to the public is on Job Glacier, where large fumaroles were discovered. While there was some indication that the fumarole field <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> the last 40 years, that July a helicopter pilot who was trained as a geologist noticed the fumaroles on the glacier. On top of that, throughout the summer of 2016 the NRC received reports of a sulphuric smell around the valley of Mount Meager.|$|E
25|$|The {{practice}} of joining together {{with family and}} friends to share ownership of vacation property <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> many years. But the fractional property industry started in the U.S. in the Rocky Mountains ski resorts in the early 1990s. These first fractional developments recognized that people did not want to buy whole homes, which they would use only for a few weeks a year in the mountains. According to research firm Ragatz Associates there were over 250 fractional developments in North America in 2006 and fractional properties can now be found throughout the world.|$|E

25|$|The {{practice}} of docking <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> centuries, and {{is older than}} the Doberman as a breed. The putative reason for docking {{is to ensure that}} the tail does not {{get in the way of}} the dog's work. Docking has always been controversial. The American Kennel Club standard for Doberman Pinschers includes a tail docked near the 2nd vertebra. Docking is a common practice in the United States, Russia and Japan (as well as a number of other countries with Doberman populations), where it is legal. In many European countries and Australia, docking has been made illegal, and in others it is limited.|$|E
25|$|Most banking {{services}} {{have their own}} credit card services that handle fraud cases and monitor for any possible attempt at fraud. Employees that are specialized in doing fraud monitoring and investigation are often placed in Risk Management, Fraud and Authorization, or Cards and Unsecured Business. Fraud monitoring emphasizes minimizing fraud losses while making an attempt to track down those responsible and contain the situation. Credit card fraud is a major white collar crime that <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> many decades, even {{with the advent of}} the chip based card (EMV) that was put into practice in some countries to prevent cases such as these. Even with the implementation of such measures, credit card fraud continues to be a problem.|$|E
25|$|Auto-gating is {{a feature}} {{found in many}} image {{intensifier}} tubes manufactured for military purposes after 2006, though it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> some time. Autogated tubes gate the image intensifier within so as to control the amount of light that gets through to the microchannel plate. The gating occurs at high frequency and by varying the duty cycle to maintain a constant current draw from the microchannel plate, {{it is possible to}} operate the tube during brighter conditions, such as daylight, without damaging the tube or leading to premature failure. Auto-gating of image intensifiers is militarily valuable as it allowed extended operational hours giving enhanced vision during twilight hours while providing better support for soldiers who encounter rapidly changing lighting conditions, such as those assaulting a building.|$|E

25|$|The {{celestial}} sphere has been divided into 88 constellations. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) constellations are {{areas of the}} sky. Each of these contains remarkable X-ray sources. Some of them are have been identified from astrophysical modeling to be galaxies or black holes at the centers of galaxies. Some are pulsars. As with sources already successfully modeled by X-ray astrophysics, striving to understand the generation of X-rays by the apparent source helps to understand the Sun, the universe as a whole, and how these affect us on Earth. Constellations are an astronomical device for handling observation and precision independent of current physical theory or interpretation. Astronomy <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> a long time. Physical theory changes with time. With respect to celestial X-ray sources, X-ray astrophysics tends {{to focus on the}} physical reason for X-ray brightness, whereas X-ray astronomy tends to focus on their classification, order of discovery, variability, resolvability, and their relationship with nearby sources in other constellations.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{one answer}} from modern science to give. What the {{original}} question now means indeed depends on choosing genus or species in the required answer. It is thought that the genus of man <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> ten times as long as our species. Currently, fresh examples of (extinct) species of the genus Homo are still being discovered, so that definitive answers are not available. The consensus view is {{that human beings are}} one species, the only existing species of the genus. With the rejection of polygenism for human origins, it is asserted that this species had a definite and single origin in the past. (That assertion leaves aside the point whether the origin meant is of the current species, however. The multiregional hypothesis allows the origin to be otherwise.) The hypothesis of recent African origin of modern humans is now widely accepted, and states that anatomically modern humans had a single origin, in Africa.|$|E
25|$|The European Union's Executive Commission {{proposed}} a European Union-wide anti-racism law in 2001, but European Union states failed {{to agree on}} the balance between prohibiting racism and freedom of expression. An attempt to ban the swastika across the EU in early 2005 failed after objections from the British Government and others. In early 2007, while Germany held the European Union presidency, Berlin proposed that the European Union should follow German Criminal Law and criminalize the denial of the Holocaust and the display of Nazi symbols including the swastika, which is based on the Ban on the Symbols of Unconstitutional Organizations Act. This led to an opposition campaign by Hindu groups across Europe against a ban on the swastika. They pointed out that the swastika <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> 5,000 years as a symbol of peace. The proposal to ban the swastika was dropped by Berlin from the proposed European Union wide anti-racism laws on 29 January 2007.|$|E

25|$|Most {{markets are}} located in middle and lower income neighborhoods. One {{exception}} is the Michoacán Market, located {{in one of the}} more prestigious neighborhoods of Mexico City, Colonia Condesa. It is located between Michoacán, Vicente Suárez and Tamaulipas streets where three colonias (official neighborhoods) intersect. It is the only mercado that provides services three, Colonia Condesa, Colonia Hipódromo and Colonia Hipódromo Condesa. These are residential neighborhoods, with some office buildings. They are considered cosmopolitan, with Art Deco and other architecture from the 1930s and 1940s, along with a number of modern structures. It is an upper income neighborhood although it has had problems associated with urban decay. While the market sells foodstuffs retail, most of its sales are to the many restaurants in the area and nearby. La Paz in the center of Tlalpan <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> about 110 years. It has 161 stands with everything from food to clothes and some esoteric products.|$|E

500|$|The {{forest in}} what is now Van Cortlandt Park <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> 17,000 years, {{since the end of the}} Wisconsin glaciation. [...] The Wiechquaskeck Lenapes were among the first {{recorded}} people to inhabit in the area now referred to as Van Cortlandt Park. They settled in the area around the 14th or 15th centuries. The Lenapes used the geographic features of the area to support their community; for instance, they used the Tibbetts Brook, Spuyten Duyvil Creek, or Hudson River for fishing, and flatland areas for farming. They formed a village named Keskeskick, whose name roughly translates to [...] "sharp grass or sedge marsh" [...] in the Unami language.|$|E
500|$|The revolutionary {{faces at}} least two special problems. First, the {{transformation}} back into naked power occurs when revolutionary power <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> a long period without achieving a resolution to its key conflict. At some point, the original goal of the creed tends to be forgotten, and consequently, the fanatics of the movement change their goals and aspire toward mere domination (Russell 1938:92). Second, the revolutionary must always deal {{with the threat of}} counter-revolutionaries, and is hence faced with a dilemma: because revolutionary power must by definition think that the original revolution was justified, it [...] "cannot, logically, contend that all subsequent revolutions must be wicked" [...] (Russell 1938:87).|$|E
