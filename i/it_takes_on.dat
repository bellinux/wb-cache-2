5|$|The 3rd Infantry Division Sustainment Brigade is a {{sustainment}} brigade of the United States Army headquartered at Fort Stewart, Georgia. The 3rd Sustainment Brigade {{is responsible}} for providing logistical support to the 3rd Infantry Division, however the modular nature of the brigade means that <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>on</b> other roles while deployed. Personnel serving under this brigade wear the Shoulder Sleeve Insignia exclusive to this brigade, rather than the insignia designated for the 3rd Infantry Division.|$|E
5|$|Because {{bulk cargo}} is so {{difficult}} to discharge, bulkers {{spend more time in}} port than other ships. A study of mini-bulkers found that <b>it</b> <b>takes,</b> <b>on</b> average, twice as much time to unload a ship as it does to load it. A mini-bulker spends 55hours at a time in port, compared to 35hours for a lumber carrier of similar size. This time in port increases to 74hours for Handymax and 120hours for Panamax vessels. Compared with the 12-hour turnarounds common for container ships, 15-hour turnarounds for car carriers, and 26-hour turnarounds for large tankers, bulker crews have more opportunities to spend time ashore.|$|E
5|$|NY187 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US20A (Quaker Road) as {{a continuation of}} County Route553 (CR553). <b>It</b> <b>takes</b> <b>on</b> CR553's name, Transit Road, and progresses northward as a two-lane road. The highway serves the nearby Bob-O-Link Golf Course prior to entering a stretch of fields in Orchard Park, where it intersects with CR460 (Milestrip Road), the eastward continuation of NY179. The route continues on, loosely paralleling Cazenovia Creek and intersecting Michael and Willardshire roads (CR365 and CR377, respectively) before passing the Harvest Hill Golf Course in Elma. NY187 soon intersects with Reserve Road, an east–west connection from US20 eastbound, before turning to the northwest and terminating at its own junction with US20. The Transit Road designation continues north onto US20.|$|E

5|$|Sitta przewalskii {{is not yet}} {{treated as}} an {{independent}} species by BirdLife International or the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and its threat level is not evaluated by either. Despite being described as rare in China and Southeast Tibet, because the taxon is treated instead as a subspecies of S. leucopsis, the evaluation of its population incorporates the relative abundance of its parent species. Concomitantly, <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>on</b> its parent category of least concern. As S. przewalskii has not been extensively studied independently from S. leucopsis, a classification of data deficient could be applied, but the rarity of sightings indicates concern for its status; a finding of near threatened or even classification as a vulnerable species may be warranted.|$|E
5|$|While H2 is {{not very}} {{reactive}} under standard conditions, it does form compounds with most elements. Hydrogen can form compounds with elements that are more electronegative, such as halogens (e.g., F, Cl, Br, I), or oxygen; in these compounds hydrogen takes on a partial positive charge. When bonded to fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen, hydrogen can participate in a form of medium-strength noncovalent bonding with the hydrogen of other similar molecules, a phenomenon called hydrogen bonding that {{is critical to the}} stability of many biological molecules. Hydrogen also forms compounds with less electronegative elements, such as metals and metalloids, where <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>on</b> a partial negative charge. These compounds are often known as hydrides.|$|E
5|$|According to Jains, the {{consequences}} of karma are inevitable. The consequences may {{take some time to}} take effect but the karma is never fruitless. The latent karma becomes active and bears fruit when the supportive conditions arise. A great part of attracted karma bears its consequences with minor fleeting effects, as generally most of our activities are influenced by mild negative emotions. However, those actions that are influenced by intense negative emotions cause an equally strong karmic attachment which usually does not bear fruit immediately. <b>It</b> <b>takes</b> <b>on</b> an inactive state and waits for the supportive conditions—like proper time, place, and environment—to arise for it to manifest and produce effects. If the supportive conditions do not arise, the respective karmas will manifest at the end of maximum period for which it can remain bound to the soul. These supportive conditions for activation of latent karmas are determined by the nature of karmas, intensity of emotional engagement at the time of binding karmas and our actual relation to time, place, surroundings. There are certain laws of precedence among the karmas, according to which the fruition of some of the karmas may be deferred but not absolutely barred.|$|E

5|$|As {{the rate}} of cooling is {{increased}} the carbon will have less time to migrate to form carbide at the grain boundaries but will have increasingly large amounts of pearlite of a finer and finer structure within the grains; hence the carbide is more widely dispersed and acts to prevent slip of defects within those grains, resulting in hardening of the steel. At the very high cooling rates produced by quenching, the carbon has no time to migrate but is locked within the face center austenite and forms martensite. Martensite is a highly strained and stressed, supersaturated form of carbon and iron and is exceedingly hard but brittle. Depending on the carbon content, the martensitic phase takes different forms. Below 0.2% carbon, <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>on</b> a ferrite BCC crystal form, but at higher carbon content it takes a body-centered tetragonal (BCT) structure. There is no thermal activation energy for the transformation from austenite to martensite. Moreover, there is no compositional change so the atoms generally retain their same neighbors.|$|E

25|$|Another way to {{understand}} the Aeroscraft’s VTOL capability is to compare the Aeroscraft to a submarine. For example, when a submarine needs to dive into the water, <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>on</b> water to make it heavier. When the submarine needs to surface, it releases that water to become lighter. Similarly, the Aeroscraft can control its weight by releasing and taking on air, controlling the heaviness or lightness of the vehicle.|$|E
25|$|Since parve food is {{reclassified}} if <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>on</b> the flavour of meat or dairy produce, Ashkenazi Jews traditionally forbid eating parve {{contents of}} a pot {{that has been used}} within 24 hours to cook meat, if the parve contents would be eaten with dairy produce. Their tradition similarly forbids eating parve foods with meat if the cooking vessel was used to cook dairy produce within the previous 24 hours. According to Joseph Caro, the Sephardic tradition was more lenient about such things, but Moses Isserles argued that such leniency was unreliable.|$|E

25|$|The demiurge {{creates the}} {{physical}} universe {{and the physical}} aspect of humanity. The demiurge typically creates a group of co-actors named archons who preside over the material realm and, in some cases, present obstacles to the soul seeking ascent from it. The inferiority of the demiurge's creation may {{be compared to the}} technical inferiority of a work of art, painting, sculpture, etc. to the thing the art represents. In other cases <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>on</b> a more ascetic tendency to view material existence negatively, which then becomes more extreme when materiality, including the human body, is perceived as evil and constrictive, a deliberate prison for its inhabitants.|$|E
25|$|The final affective {{response}} or emotion seen in initial infidelity is anger (Johnson, 2017). Anger is {{an emotion}} that is felt in {{all stages of}} infidelity, but in different ways and at different calibers. In {{the initial stages of}} infidelity anger is an underlying emotion that is usually exposed after the buildup of other emotions such as jealousy and resentment. When a partner is suspicious of another’s intentions and actions they become frustrated with that partner and tend to get angry at them more easily and feel that the anger is not anticipated. In turn, the suspected unfaithful partner will be confused and become angry at the other starting fight. Anger is noticed to be a key emotion within a situation like infidelity, <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>on</b> many roles and forms throughout the process but in the initial stage of cheating anger can be an affective emotion because of how unpredictable and rapid it can happen without thinking of one’s actions and feelings before doing so.|$|E

25|$|The City of Chicago {{is looking}} into a plan for an express train that would take tourists, locals, and other {{travelers}} from downtown Chicago to O'Hare International Airport in about 20 minutes, which is half the time <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>on</b> the City's Blue Line. If an express train does get built, one-time tickets would likely cost around $30 to $35. Less expensive monthly passes and family discounts might also become available. The City will look for a private company to cover construction costs and operate the system, but it's likely public money would go into building stations {{at the airport and}} downtown if the project moves ahead. The city says an engineering firm will spend the next 10 months evaluating potential routes, drafting designs and coming up with a construction timeline and cost estimate, then put it out for bid in 2017. In the early 1990s, the idea of a 20-minute O'Hare express train service has been proposed. Some plans included bypass tracks on the CTA Blue Line that run {{down the middle of the}} Kennedy Expressway as well as use of a Union Pacific Railroad right-of-way near the Kennedy.

25|$|Crossing into Broome County, NY 17C {{abruptly}} {{climbs up}} the side of Bornt Hill and parallels the tracks and river into the town of Union, entering the urban core of the Binghamton metropolitan area. The route, still bearing the name of Campville Road, runs over the hill to the north and west of Tri-Cities Airport and the Triple Cities to the east become visible for the first time. After passing Glendale Technology Park, a former IBM complex, NY 17C crosses over to {{the south side of the}} railroad and passes the En-Joie Golf Course, one of the many remnants of the area's prosperity under Endicott-Johnson. As <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>on</b> the name West Main Street and crosses South Grippen Avenue, NY 17C becomes a residential street, passing numerous single-family homes for a short distance as it crosses the border into Endicott. The route becomes a commercial village street before intersecting with NY 26, Nanticoke Avenue, at the center of downtown Union. Now concurrent, NY 17C and NY 26 pick up an additional lane on each side as they proceed east as East Main Street through Endicott. The next major intersection is with Vestal Avenue, where NY 26 formerly left NY 17C, turning south and crossing the Susquehanna River to enter Vestal on Bridge Street, now CR 48.
