500|$|Judi Dench as Evelyn Greenslade, a {{recently}} widowed housewife whose house must {{be sold to}} pay off her husband's debts. Like his father, her son wants to [...] "care" [...] for her, without her input. At Sonny's home for the [...] "elderly and beautiful", she keeps a blog of her activities. She narrates throughout the film, from bookend to bookend, from the opening sequence to the Day 51 moral [...] "We <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> we do our best".|$|E
500|$|Albert Brooks {{plays the}} foul-mouthed, morose Bernie Rose. When Refn {{suggested}} him, Gosling agreed, but thought the actor {{would not be}} up for playing a character who is violent and sullen, or for appearing in a film {{that he did not}} work on himself. Brooks accepted the role to go against type, and because he loved that Bernie was not a cliché. [...] "There are six people you could always get to play this kind of part, and I like that the director was thinking outside of the box. For me, it was an opportunity to act outside the box. I liked that this mobster had real style. Also, he doesn't <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> thinking about killing people. He's sad about it. Upset about it. It's a case of, 'Look what you made me do.'" ...|$|E
500|$|... "The End of All Things" [...] {{was written}} by co-executive {{producer}} David Fury, while being directed by [...] veteran, Jeff Hunt. It was Hunt's third series credit (his other two being [...] "The Man from the Other Side" [...] and [...] "The Box"). Leading up to the episode's broadcast, executive producer Jeff Pinkner remarked {{in a conference call}} with journalists that it was a [...] "game-changer" [...] because [...] "our characters learn a lot more and the audience is going to learn a lot more about the über-plot of the season’s bad guy, David Robert Jones." [...] Referring to the Observer September, Pinker added that the episode would also peel [...] "back some layers about what his agenda has been and use that as an opportunity to revisit the things on the show we’ve seen before." [...] Fellow executive producer J.H. Wyman elaborated [...] "We always said you would find out about the Observers this season {{and we were going to}} investigate them a lot more. We’re excited about it all. That’s a highlight– the Observers are a highlight. For us to constantly break what you know and reset and have people go, 'Wow, I didn’t see that coming!' That’s why we <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> is to take people along for the ride. We’re excited about what’s coming up, too." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2010, {{starting}} {{horses in}} 53 races for the year, she also {{took over the}} training of then-two-year-old Mucho Macho Man when her husband Tim stopped training horses because he began working {{as part of the}} management at Gulfstream Park. [...] Working with owners Reeves Thoroughbred Racing, the horse ran in the 2011 Kentucky Derby. Ritvo was only the 14th woman to train a horse entered in the Kentucky Derby in the 137 years it had been run to that date, and the third-place finish of the horse was the best for a woman trainer {{in the history of the}} race. [...] She kept her perspective: [...] "I'm so proud to be in the Derby, but just to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> is amazing." [...] She next ran Mucho Macho Man in the other two legs of the Triple Crown, the 136th Preakness Stakes and the 143rd Belmont Stakes, where he finished sixth and seventh respectively. Only 13 women trainers had saddled a starter prior to the 2011 Preakness, and Ritvo was only the 10th woman trainer to start a horse in the Belmont. [...] Mucho Macho Man had overcome his own health problems in order to race, including having appeared to be lifeless at birth. Comparing her own experiences to the horse, Ritvo stated, [...] "From the moment I opened my eyes, I felt fantastic. He's Mucho Macho Man and I'm Macho Woman." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hogan {{was known}} to {{practice}} {{more than any other}} golfer of his contemporaries and is said to have [...] "invented practice". On this matter, Hogan himself said, [...] "You hear stories about me beating my brains out practicing, but... I was enjoying myself. I couldn't wait to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> so I could hit balls. When I'm hitting the ball where I want, hard and crisply, it's a joy that very few people experience." [...] He {{was also one of the}} first players to match particular clubs to yardages, or reference points around the course such as bunkers or trees, in order to improve his distance control.|$|E

2500|$|Poulidor {{has several}} times {{accepted}} that {{his career was}} handicapped {{by a lack of}} ambition and by the psychological domination of Jacques Anquetil. Poulidor {{said in an interview in}} 1992: I knew straight away that I was getting places everywhere. I got all the leaders' jerseys but I used to lose them. Tonin [...] said to me [...] "Raymond, you're always in a daydream!" [...] And was that true? Were you distracted? It was true. I thought what was happening to me was already marvellous enough. I never thought of winning. Never, ever, did I <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> with the idea of winning! ...|$|E
2500|$|... “After I {{had learned}} to play a little, I was chosen to give all the bugle calls. [...] I had to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> before the others and arouse {{everybody}} by blowing the morning call. [...] Evenings at ten minutes before nine o’clock I blew again. [...] Then all of the boys would run for their rooms. [...] At nine o’clock the second call was given, when all lights were tuned out and {{we were supposed to}} be in bed. [...] Later on I learned the mess call, and eventually could blow all the calls of the regular army.” The Carlisle Indian band of brass instruments performed at football games, world expositions and presidential inaugural parades. On May 24, 1883, Luther led the first “real American” band to cross the Brooklyn Bridge at its grand opening ceremony.|$|E
2500|$|In {{subsequent}} legal hearings, residents testified how: [...] "If {{you walked}} {{right behind the}} factory it was like cotton.

I used to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> and {{the other side of the}} street always had a layer of fine dust with footmarks on it from the early morning workers." [...] Of the conditions in the nearby school one said: [...] "The dust was always there while I was at school, lying on walls or window ledges if it had been damp. It was like snow fall." [...] Describing the loading bay, to which local children had easy access, one witness recalled: [...] "Sometimes sacks were left out overnight. They were hessian sacks and they were full of a sort of fluffy dust. We could jump on the sacks when they were left out... I remember seeing grey-blue coloured dust come out of them. If we jumped hard enough the sacks burst open. After sitting or bouncing on the sacks I remember being covered in dust." [...] During the summer doors and windows of both the factory and the houses were left open for cooling, and during the winter children often congregated around the factory's street-level ventilation outlets for warmth.|$|E
