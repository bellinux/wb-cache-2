However, political scientists {{mentioned that}} PR would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> <b>time</b> getting support from rural areas, referring to the DAP's dismal performance in rural polling centres. Nevertheless, encouraged by the strong support from the urban Chinese community in the Sibu by-election, DAP is now aiming to win the four other Chinese-majority parliamentary seats (namely the Sarikei, Miri, Stampin and Lanang seats) and seven other State constituencies held by SUPP in Sarawak.|$|E
500|$|Whether or not {{the book}} will be adapted to film remains a matter of speculation. When asked whether {{there would be a}} movie {{adaptation}} of Eldest at the premiere of Eragon, Christopher Paolini replied, [...] "I think we'll know after opening weekend." [...] Many critics have considered the possibility of a sequel in their reviews of Eragon. One critic said that 20th Century Fox's plans to adapt Eldest was [...] "" [...] and that [...] "they will <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> <b>time</b> convincing anyone but the most die-hard fans to return for another helping." [...] Even some critics who gave the film positive reviews were skeptical towards the possibility of a sequel: [...] "That the studio hopes to build a franchise on this, now that—that is expecting way too much." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{praised the}} many {{different}} factors adding to complexity of the campaign, ActionTrip noting that [...] "Medieval adds a new strategic balance to the game, which teaches that great empires come with an even greater responsibility". Eurogamer praised the way the player had to manage production queues, guard the loyalty of important generals and make use of spies and assassins, calling the level of control [...] "far ahead of anything seen in the previous game"; many other reviews shared a similar view. The number of factions in the game, each with their own historically accurate units and territories, was commended, with IGN and Game Informer stating it [...] "gives the game huge replay value", with GameSpot adding [...] "the strategic portion now {{has a lot more}} options". Many reviewers gave praise to the fact the historical setting of the Middle Ages was said to be well integrated into the game; PC Zone acknowledging the [...] "brutality and instability" [...] of the era is well included in the game, with GameSpot praising the religion in the game, [...] "religion played an enormous role in shaping history, and so it is in the game". GameSpy stated that the different historical starting positions made the games attention to detail [...] "impressive and noteworthy"; the historical battle system was also highly received from Computer Gaming World, stating that they successfully [...] "provide an authentic glimpse of the past". However, GameSpot commented on a problem with a lack of information, [...] "you'll <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> <b>time</b> keeping track of all the goings-on in your provinces", suggesting this could be solved through a more informative interface. Overall, reviewers highly complimented the strategic gameplay, many saying it was similar to a Civilization-style game.|$|E

2500|$|The Devil in Miss Jones {{was one of}} {{the first}} films to be {{inducted}} into the XRCO Hall of Fame. The sound-recording, cinematography, and story-line of The Devil in Miss Jones were of a considerably higher quality than any previous porn film. The lead, Georgina Spelvin, who had been in the original Broadway run of The Pajama Game, combined vigorous sex with an acting performance some thought as convincing as anything to be seen in a good mainstream production. She had been hired as a caterer, but Gerard Damiano, the film director, was impressed with her reading of Miss Jones's dialogue, while auditioning an actor for the non-sex role of 'Abaca'. According to Variety's [...] review, [...] "With The Devil in Miss Jones, the hard-core porno feature approaches an art form, one that critics may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> <b>time</b> ignoring in the future". The review also described the plot as comparable to Jean-Paul Sartre's play No Exit, and went on to describe the opening scene as, [...] "a sequence so effective it would stand out in any legit theatrical feature." [...] It finished by stating, [...] "Booking a film of this technical quality into a standard sex house is tantamount to throwing it on the trash heap of most current hard-core fare." ...|$|E
