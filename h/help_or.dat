5|$|The Rhind Papyrus {{illustrates}} some of Ahmose's {{military strategy}} when attacking the Delta. Entering Heliopolis in July, he {{moved down the}} eastern delta to take Tjaru, the major border fortification on the Horus Road, the road from Egypt to Canaan, in October, totally avoiding Avaris. In taking Tjaru he cut off all traffic between Canaan and Avaris. This indicates he was planning a blockade of Avaris, isolating the Hyksos capital from <b>help</b> <b>or</b> supplies coming from Canaan.|$|E
5|$|Beliefs in {{the divine}} and in the afterlife were {{ingrained}} in ancient Egyptian civilization from its inception; pharaonic rule {{was based on the}} divine right of kings. The Egyptian pantheon was populated by gods who had supernatural powers and were called on for <b>help</b> <b>or</b> protection. However, the gods were not always viewed as benevolent, and Egyptians believed they had to be appeased with offerings and prayers. The structure of this pantheon changed continually as new deities were promoted in the hierarchy, but priests made no effort to organize the diverse and sometimes conflicting myths and stories into a coherent system. These various conceptions of divinity were not considered contradictory but rather layers in the multiple facets of reality.|$|E
5|$|Stringer did {{not expect}} the success of Glee Cast single releases, and {{estimated}} that four million copies would be sold by Christmas2009. He was unsure whether the high sales figures would <b>help</b> <b>or</b> hinder the release of Glee: The Music, Volume1, and as such, was eager for its release in order to gauge the physical and digital market response. The 17 tracks selected for the album were considered amongst the series' most popular, with Columbia and Fox aiming to attract casual buyers as well as Glee fans. Geoff Bywater, head of Fox's music department, anticipated considerable sales from impulse buyers in retail stores. Instrumental versions of some songs were included as bonus tracks, based on a trend of fans recreating the musical numbers in tribute to the show.|$|E

Tomoya has been labeled a delinquent; at the {{beginning}} of the story, he even expresses hatred toward the city he has lived in all his life where Clannad is set. He is very straightforward in his comments to others and will not hesitate to speak his mind, even if he comes off as rude during such times. Despite this, Tomoya is very loyal to his friends, and has been known to dedicate himself for those around him in need of <b>help</b> <b>or</b> support. He generally has a selfless personality and does not ask much from others in return for what he does for them.|$|E

5|$|An {{accomplice}} {{could be}} sued {{if he had}} provided help ope consilio – a physical act relating to the method of execution, rather than mere encouragement. It appears that Labeo {{was the first to}} require <b>help</b> <b>or</b> advice, and earlier sources suggest that both help and advice was required. Labeo's version was certainly entrenched by the early second century AD. An accomplice was treated as if he himself had committed the crime. Only one person needed to have handled the thing for all wrongdoers to be liable. Republican jurists were harder on accomplices than later jurists under the empire. Indeed, Ulpian considers the unwitting accomplice, who accidentally knocks out of the victim's hand some coins which are then stolen, an accomplice to the theft. Some commentators have gone as far to say that the veteres ("ancients") may not have even required a third party to remove the coins, {{as long as they were}} otherwise lost to the owner.|$|E

5|$|Combat is turn-based, {{with each}} {{character}} in the player's party receiving action points {{at the beginning of}} the player's turn. The number received is dependent on the items the player character has equipped and the skills the character or creations possess. Each action uses a specific number of points, for example, moving one square takes a single point and attacks or spells take five. Attacking or spellcasting with fewer than ten action points immediately ends the character's turn, otherwise a character can continue to act until they run out of points. Most enemies will attack the player on sight, retreating in terror if they reach a certain threshold of damage without being killed. Other specialized behaviors are also present, including creatures which call for <b>help,</b> <b>or</b> creatures which act as sentries and retreat to an ambush location when threatened. Creations made by the player character can also be controlled by a similar artificial intelligence, or the player can invest more essence in the creation's intelligence and control them manually.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{restoration}} to Byzantine rule, relations between Thessalonica and Constantinople remained troubled, with Thessalonica's local aristocracy jealously guarding their extensive privileges, which apparently amounted to virtual autonomy. This {{was part of}} a wider phenomenon for several cities during the last century of Byzantine history, as the state's central authority weakened. In Thessalonica's case, a tendency of independence from the imperial capital had been evident at least since the Zealot movement of the mid-14th century, and had been reinforced by Manuel II's autonomous regime in 1382–1387. Thus, Thessalonica and the surrounding region were given as an autonomous appanage to John VII Palaiologos. After his death in 1408, he was succeeded by Manuel's third son, the Despot Andronikos Palaiologos, who was supervised by Demetrios Leontares until 1415. During this time, Thessalonica enjoyed a period of relative peace and prosperity, as the Turks were preoccupied with their own civil war, but was attacked by the rival Ottoman pretenders in 1412 (by Musa Çelebi) and 1416 (during the uprising of Mustafa Çelebi against Mehmed I). Once the Ottoman civil war ended, the Turkish pressure on the city began to increase again. Just as during the 1383–1387 siege, this led to a sharp division of opinion within the city between factions supporting resistance, if necessary with Western <b>help,</b> <b>or</b> submission to the Ottomans.|$|E
