The organism produced a large quantity of glucose isomerase when grown on straw <b>hemicellulose,</b> <b>xylan,</b> xylose, and H 2 SO 4 hydrolysate of ryegrass straw. The organism produced glucose isomerase both intra- and extra-cellularly. The highest level of intracellular glucose isomerase (3. 5 U/ml) was obtained in about 36 h by a culture grown on straw hemicellulose; the extracellular enzyme (1. 5 U/ml) appeared in cultures grown for about 72 h. About equal levels of enzyme were produced in cultures grown on straw <b>hemicellulose,</b> <b>xylan,</b> xylose, and H 2 SO 4 hydrolysate of straw, but production of the enzyme was drastically reduced when the organism was grown on other carbon sources. As a nitrogen source, corn steep liquor produced the best results. Soy flour extract, yeast extract, and various peptones also were adequate substrates for glucose isomerase production. Addition of Mg 2 +, Mn 2 +, or Fe 2 + to the growth medium significantly enhanced enzyme production.

40|$|Graduation date: 1997 Environmental {{concerns}} about urban air quality, global climate change, energy security and economic considerations motivate a {{growing interest in}} alternative fuels for the transportation sector. Ethanol, a fermentation-derived fuel, can be produced by bioconversion of renewable materials, such as wood, grass, and waste. Combustion of ethanol fuel, in both neat and blended form, can improve the engine efficiency, and lower the emission of CO, NO[subscript x], and volatile organic compounds (VOC), hence reducing the urban ozone level. Moreover, enhanced agricultural activities for production and collection of lignocellulosic feedstocks and industrial developments for production of ethanol will help the economic growth by creating new jobs and new income sources. Bioconversion of lignocellulosic feedstocks into ethanol requires a pretreatment process to increase the digestibility of cellulose by cellulolytic enzymes. The dilute-sulfuric acid pretreatment can hydrolyze <b>hemicelluloses</b> (<b>xylan),</b> disrupt lignin structure, and increase the yield of ethanol production from fermentation of monomeric units of cellulose (glucose).

While the role of polysaccharide acetylation in vivo is unclear, it is known to reduce biofuel yield from lignocellulosic biomass by the inhibition of microorganisms used for fermentation.

Loss-of-function mutants in one of the genes, designated REDUCED WALL ACETYLATION 2 (RWA 2), had decreased levels of acetylated cell wall polymers. Cell wall material isolated from mutant leaves and treated with alkali released about 20 % lower amounts of acetic acid when compared with the wild type. The same level of acetate deficiency was found in several pectic polymers and in xyloglucan. Thus, the rwa 2 mutations affect different polymers to the same extent.

The AA dosage of 20  % was found to be optimal to maintain the viscosity level. This phenomenon is probably caused by a higher extent of hemicellulose degradation which increases the cellulose ratio than that of the treatment with AA dosage of 19  %, because viscosity of cellulose is generally higher than that of xylan. However, for an AA dosage higher than 21  %, cellulose degradation should start and thus cause the viscosity decrement.|$|E
40|$|We adapted and {{optimized}} {{a method}} to quantify the cellulose, <b>hemicellulose,</b> <b>xylan,</b> arabinan, mannan, galactan contents in lignocellulosic biomass. This method {{is based on a}} neutral detergent extraction (NDE) of the interfering biomass components, followed by a sulfuric acid hydrolysis (SAH) of the structural polysaccharides, and a liquid chromatography with charged aerosol detection (LC-CAD) to analyze the released monosaccharides. The first step of this NDE-SAH-LC-CAD method aims at removing all compounds that interfere with the subsequent sulphuric acid hydrolysis or with the subsequent chromatographic quantification of the cellulosic and hemicellulosic monosaccharides. This step includes starch hydrolysis with an analytical thermostable α-amylase followed by an extraction of soluble compounds by a Van Soest neutral detergent solution (NDE). The aim of this paper was to assess the precision of this method when choosing fiber sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench), tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) and fiber hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) as representative lignocellulosic biomass. The cellulose content of fiber sorghum, tall fescue and fiber hemp determined by the NDE-SAH-LC-CAD method were 28. 7 ± 1. 0, 29. 7 ± 1. 0 and 43. 6 ± 1. 2 g/ 100 g dry matter, respectively, and their hemicellulose content were 18. 6 ± 0. 5, 16. 5 ± 0. 5 and 14. 5 ± 0. 2 g/ 100 g dry matter, respectively. Cellulose, mannan and galactan contents were higher in fiber hemp (dicotyledon) as compared to tall fescue and fiber sorghum (monocotyledons). The xylan, arabinan and total hemicellulose contents were higher in tall fescue and fiber sorghum as compared to fiber hemp. The precision of the NDE-SAH-LC-CAD method was better for polysaccharide concentration levels above 1 g/ 100 g dry matter. Galactan analysis offered a lower precision, due to a lower CAD response intensity to galactose as compared to the other monosaccharides. The dispersions of the results (expanded uncertainty) of the NDE-SAH-LC-CAD method were smaller as compared to the Van Soest (VS) method. In addition, the NDE-SAH-LC-CAD method was able to provide additional information on the composition of the <b>hemicellulose</b> (<b>xylan,</b> arabinan, mannan and galactan content) that is not provided by the Van Soest method. The NDE-SAH-LC-CAD method offers also the advantage of a better specificity for hemicellulose and cellulose, as compared to the NREL and Uppsala methods...|$|E

In {{order to understand the}} factors contributing to reducing sugar yields from pretreated biomass and the possible influence of hemicellulose derived pseudo-lignin on cellulose conversion at the moderate to low enzyme loadings necessary for favorable economics, dilute acid pretreatment of Avicel cellulose alone and mixed with beechwood xylan or xylose was performed at various severities. Following pretreatment, the solids were enzymatically hydrolyzed and characterized for chemical composition and physical properties by NMR, FT-IR, and SEM imaging. It was found that <b>hemicelluloses</b> (<b>xylan)</b> derived-pseudo-lignin was formed at even moderate severities and that these insoluble degradation products can significantly retard cellulose hydrolysis. Furthermore, al-though low severity (CSF 1. 94) dilute acid pretreatment of a xylan–Avicel mixture hydrolyzed most of the xylan (98 %) and produced negligible amounts of pseudo-lignin, enzymatic conversion of cellulose dropped significantly (> 25 %) compared to cellulose pretreated alone at the same conditions. The drop in cellulose conversion was higher than realized for cellulase inhibition by xylooligomers reported previously.

Comparison of the film behaviours was achieved using the GAB and PARK models for the sorption isotherms and the PEK model for the sorption kinetics. Our data indicated that without chemical functionalization, the water-sorption properties of the hemicellulose films were enhanced after forming lignin under mild enzymatic conditions. Notably, the hydrophobic nature of lignin was not expressed in these films, in contrast to the systems that resulted from a simple mixing of lignin with hemicelluloses.

Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray scattering, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to qualitatively and quantitatively measure bonding interactions, morphology, and thermal stability of the regenerated films. The results demonstrated that the regenerated films’ structural, morphological, and thermal character changed {{as a function of}} lignin-xylan concentration. The decomposition temperature rose according to an increase in lignin content and the surface topography of the regenerated films changed from fibrous to spherical patterns. This suggests that lignin-xylan concentration alters the self-assembly of lignin and the cellulose microfibril development. X-ray scattering confirms the extent of the morphological and molecular changes.

In contrast to cholestyramine which intensively binds biliary lipids (6 1. 7 - 8 1. 7 %) and pancreatic lipase (47. 5 %), the fibers studied only had a low adsorbent power. The direct influence ofthese fibers and ofcholestyramine at concentrations ranging from 0 - 5 % on lipase activity was measured at constant pH, using two conventional assay systems, long chain triglycerides and tributyrin.

In general, wood chips of Eucalyptus viminalis Labill were shown to be more amenable to pretreatment than chips derived from bolds of Mimosa scabrella Benth (bracatinga). This was apparent from all pretreatment parameters tested including the overall recovery yields of pretreated fractions, carbohydrates (pentoses and hexoses) recovered as water-solubles, yield of dehydration by-products and lignin susceptibility to acid hydrolysis. There was no evidence for complete deacetylation of both wood species during pretreatment and lignin appeared to undergo extensive acid hydrolysis at higher pretreatment severities. Steam treatment at 205 oC for 5 min without addition of an acid catalyst was shown to be uncapable of removing the hemicellulose component from bracatinga chips, as determined by chemical analysis of the steam-treated water-insoluble fractions.

Qualitative assessment of complex samples like plant and wood tissues requires {{the availability of a}} range of specific probes. Monoclonal antibodies and naturally existing carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs) have been used in the past to assess the presence of certain carbohydrates in plant tissues. However, the number of natural CBMs is limited and development of carbohydrate-specific antibodies is not always straightforward. We envisage the use of sets of very similar proteins specific for defined targets, like those developed by molecular evolution of a single CBM scaffold, as a suitable strategy to assess carbohydrate composition. An advantage of using synthetic CBMs lies in the possibility to study fine details of carbohydrate composition within non-uniform substrates like plant cell walls as made possible through minor differences in CBM specificity of the variety of binders that can be developed by genetic engineering. Results A panel of synthetic xylan-binding CBMs, previously selected from a molecular library based on the scaffold of CBM 4 - 2 from xylanase Xyn 10 A of Rhodothermus marinus, was used in this study. The wild type CBM 4 - 2 and evolved modules both showed binding to wood sections. However, differences were observed in the staining patterns suggesting that these modules have different xylan-binding properties. Also the staining stability varied between the CBMs, the most stable staining being obtained with one (X- 2) of the synthetic modules. Treatment of wood materials resulted in altered signal intensities, thereby also demonstrating the potential application of engineered CBMs as analytical tools for quality assessment of diverse plant material processes.

I utilized methods that used fewer mineral acids and tried to replace them with an organic acid (maleic acid). We hypothesized that the mineral acids could be replaced in the conversion processes. It was also very important to also utilize actual plant materials to gauge the real world applications of these replacement techniques. The effect of different ions on the conversion of xylose to furfural was investigated. ^ The effect of different halides on the conversion of xylose was studied through the use of different hydrohalic acids (HCl, HBr, HI). The selectivity (productive conversion/nonproductive conversion) increases as halide size increases (Cl- 3 ̆c Br- 3 ̆c I-). The effect of the different metals was also investigated. The LiCl was compared to KCl and NH 4 Cl. There was no noticeable difference between the alkali metals; the ammonium had a more pronounced effect in comparison. The nonproductive conversion increases and the productive conversion decreases. This change in selectivity can be contributed to possible Schiff base/Maillard reactions. The ionic strength of the solution between different metals was compared. Solutions with the same ionic strength have similar rates of xylose conversion. Weaker bases with limited H-bonding ability (e. g. I-) decrease nonproductive conversion of xylose to furfural. ^ Maleic acid was used as an acid in xylose conversion to furfural. H 2 MA was chosen due to maleate being a weak base with limited H-bonding due to intramolecular H-bonding. Maleic acid has been demonstrated to be a very selective in the hydrolysis of <b>hemicellulose</b> (<b>xylans)</b> to form monosaccharide xylose in very high yields (≥ 85...|$|R
40|$|Xylo-oligosaccharides were {{obtained}} from Miscanthus x giganteus. The process {{was designed as a}} biorefinery scheme, which seeks the separation of the three main components: cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin. To extract the <b>hemicelluloses,</b> particularly <b>xylans,</b> in an efficient way, Miscanthus was subjected to autohydrolysis. The system was evaluated for the effects of temperature (160 to 200 degrees C) and reaction time (15 to 60 min) on various parameters, reflecting the changes undergone during the process. The results showed that autohydrolysis is a suitable method for obtaining high yields of xylo-oligosaccharides, reaching values close to 65 % of the dissolved xylans (based on the initial amount of potential xylose). Analysis of the process by using the severity factor (R-O) allowed for the identification of a set of time-temperature values for which the fractionation was optimal...|$|R
40|$|Why study cellulases and xylanases? Although {{this review}} focusses {{primarily}} on bacterial cellulases and xylanases, {{there is considerable}} overlap in the molecular biology and biochemistry of prokaryotic and fungal forms of these enzymes. Therefore, fungal plant cell wall hydrolases are discussed where comparisons with the corresponding bacterial enzymes are important. Cellulases and xylanases encompass a collection of enzymes whose primary function is to hydrolyse p- 1, 4 -glycosidic linkages in the major plant structural polysaccharides, cellulose and xylan. In converting cellulose and xylan to their constituent sugars, these enzymes play {{an essential role in}} the digestive processes of herbivores and in the recycling of photosynthetically fixed carbon. The past decade has seen a burgeoning interest in all aspects of the biochemistry and molecular biology of cellulases and xylanases, which at first glance is rather perplexing. As a paradigm for p- 1, 4 glycanases, lysozyme is the enzyme of choice; it has been studied in greater detail than cellulases or xylanases and has a clearly understood catalytic mechanism. The recent discoveries from analysis of gene sequences and the three-dimensional structure of cellulase proteins show, however, that there is much to be understood about the enzymic hydrolysis of plant carbohydrate polymers beyond what can be adduced from analogy with lysozyme. To really appreciate the rationale behind current studies of microbial cellulases and xylanases, it is necessary to take a broad view that takes into account not just their intrinsic interest, but also their undoubted commercial potential. The structural polysaccharides cellulose and <b>hemicellulose</b> (<b>xylan</b> being the majo...|$|E
40|$|Biomass fuels {{represent}} a renewable energy source, they are CO 2 neutral fuels, {{and their use}} reduces the consumption of fossil fuels and limits the emissions of SOx, NOx, and heavy metals. They are used in pyrolysis, gasification, combustion, and co-combustion. The devolatilization is a fundamental mechanism in all these processes, especially for high volatile matter fuels. In this work, the devolatilization of biomass fuels (of different origin, properties, and composition) and biomass components is studied coupling thermogravimetric (TG) analysis with infrared spectroscopy. The characteristic temperatures are determined for the main devolatilization steps and compared for all fuels. A bituminous coal and a paper sludge are also studied for comparison. Light gases released (CO, CO 2, H 2 O, CH 4, CH 3 OH, HCOOH) are detected, whereas more complex organic (hydrocarbon and oxygenated) compounds are grouped {{because of the large}} variety of volatile species released in a narrow range of temperature. The weight loss of biomass fuels is related to their chemical composition (i. e., considering the devolatilization behavior of cellulose, <b>hemicellulose</b> (<b>xylan),</b> and lignin in the same operating conditions). The aim of the work is to apply a summative law for the TG results (validated in previous experimental and literature works) to obtain the chemical composition of biomass fuels and to validate and extend a summative law for the FTIR profiles of volatile species released. Calculated values obtained using this method are in good agreement with the experimental results. Therefore, the validation of this correlation allows the prediction of the devolatilization of biomass fuels considering the initial chemical composition. This is useful for practical applications, plant designing, handling, and modeling...|$|E
30|$|Other than d-xylose, l-arabinose is {{the second}} most {{abundant}} pentose in polysaccharides from the plant cell wall that is widely populated with arabinan, arabinoxylan, arabinogalactan and rhamnogalacturonan I (Seiboth and Metz 2011; Caffall and Mohnen 2009). The backbones of these polysaccharides often contain arabinofuranose side chains. Arabinan is composed of an α- 1, 5 -l-arabinofuranose backbone with α- 1, 3 -l-arabinofuranose and α- 1, 2 -l-arabinofuranose side chains (Sakamoto and Kawasaki 2003). Arabinoxylan consists of β- 1, 4 -d-xylan in which arabinose residues are substituted of O- 2 or O- 3 sites of the xylan backbone (Kormelink et al. 1993). Arabinogalactan is present on the backbone of β- 1, 3 -galactose-linked with α-l-arabinofuranose and β-l-arabinopyranose side chains (Ponder and Richards 1997). In addition, the rhamnogalacturonan-I backbone is also substituted with various oligosaccharides, such as arabinooligosaccharides and galactan oligosaccharides (Gruppen et al. 1993). l-Arabinose is an important sugar in the food and biofuel industries, as well as in pharmaceutics (Amore et al. 2012), and it has excellent potential as prebiotics and inhibition of sucrose absorption (Altamimi et al. 2006; Seri et al. 1996). The production of l-arabinose by α-l-arabinofuranosidases is efficient and environmentally friendly. As the main component of <b>hemicellulose,</b> <b>xylan</b> also has potential applications in food industry. Because the side chains of xylan are often decorated with α-l-arabinofuranose (Song et al. 2012), it is necessary to hydrolyze arabinose residues efficiently using α-l-arabinofuranosidases to produce xylan (Gao et al. 2011). Thus, it is essential to obtain a variety of α-l-arabinofuranosidases to prepare oligosaccharide fragments and analyze the structures of polysaccharides. In this work, we have explored the biochemical characterization of a novel α- 1, 3 -arabinofuranosidase (PoAbf 62 A) from P. oxalicum sp. 68, that can specially remove α-l- 1, 3 -Araf from sugar beet arabinan. This work provides a new tool for industrial preparation of polysaccharides, {{as well as for the}} structural analysis of polysaccharides.|$|E
40|$|With some {{lines of}} oil-palm tissue {{cultures}} embryogenesis occurs spontaneously within the callus grown on a medium containing 2. 5 mg of 3 -naphthylacetic acid/litre. One {{of the initial}} biochemical events that occurs just before the embryoid can be seen is the accumulation of fat droplets within the cells. This accumulation of lipid is correlated {{with an increase in}} acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity. The carboxylase is thus probably a rate-limiting step in fatty acid synthesis in these cells and {{can be used as a}} quantitative marker of somatic embryogenesis within the tissue. During the development of the embryoid tissue there is an increase in cell division and the differentiation of vascular cells with secondary thickened walls. These stages of the differentiation may be monitored by measuring the ratio of pectin synthesis (polygalacturonic acid formation) to <b>hemicellulose</b> synthesis (<b>xylan</b> formation) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The complex {{carbohydrate}} {{composition of}} natural and refined plant material is not known in detail but a matter that is of both basic and applied importance. Qualitative assessment of complex samples like plant and wood tissues requires {{the availability of a}} range of specific probes. Monoclonal antibodies and naturally existing carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs) have been used in the past to assess the presence of certain carbohydrates in plant tissues. However, the number of natural CBMs is limited and development of carbohydrate-specific antibodies is not always straightforward. We envisage the use of sets of very similar proteins specific for defined targets, like those developed by molecular evolution of a single CBM scaffold, as a suitable strategy to assess carbohydrate composition. An advantage of using synthetic CBMs lies in the possibility to study fine details of carbohydrate composition within non-uniform substrates like plant cell walls as made possible through minor differences in CBM specificity of the variety of binders that can be developed by genetic engineering. Results A panel of synthetic xylan-binding CBMs, previously selected from a molecular library based on the scaffold of CBM 4 - 2 from xylanase Xyn 10 A of Rhodothermus marinus, was used in this study. The wild type CBM 4 - 2 and evolved modules both showed binding to wood sections. However, differences were observed in the staining patterns suggesting that these modules have different xylan-binding properties. Also the staining stability varied between the CBMs, the most stable staining being obtained with one (X- 2) of the synthetic modules. Treatment of wood materials resulted in altered signal intensities, thereby also demonstrating the potential application of engineered CBMs as analytical tools for quality assessment of diverse plant material processes. Conclusion In this study we have demonstrated the usefulness of synthetic xylan-binding modules as specific probes in analysis of <b>hemicelluloses</b> (<b>xylan)</b> in wood and fibre materials. </p...|$|R
