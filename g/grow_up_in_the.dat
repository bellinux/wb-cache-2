5|$|Tactile ASL (TASL) is {{a variety}} of ASL used {{throughout}} the United States by and with the deaf-blind. It is particularly common among those with Usher's syndrome. This syndrome results in deafness from birth followed by loss of vision later in life; consequently, those with Usher's syndrome often <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Deaf community using ASL, and later transition to TASL. TASL differs from ASL in that signs are produced by touching the palms, {{and there are some}} grammatical differences from standard ASL in order to compensate for the lack of non-manual signing.|$|E

25|$|In recent years, Sacred Harp singing has {{experienced}} a resurgence in popularity, as it is discovered by new participants who did not <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tradition. New singers typically strive to follow the original southern customs at their singings. Traditional singers have responded to this need by providing help in orienting the newcomers. For instance, the Rudiments section of the 1991 Denson edition includes {{information on how to}} hold a singing; this information would be superfluous in a traditional context, but is important for a group starting up on its own. The tradition of the singing master is still carried on today, and singing masters from traditional Sacred Harp regions often travel outside the South to teach. In recent years an annual summer camp has been established, at which newcomers can learn to sing Sacred Harp.|$|E
25|$|Winifred Banks – {{the wife}} of George Banks, and mother to Jane and Michael. In the musical and film, she is {{presented}} as a society woman. In the film, she is a suffragette and involved in social causes. In the musical, she is a former actress. Her family and maiden name are not mentioned, however in the books, she has two aunts that are mentioned, Aunt Flossie and Aunt Caroline. In the musical, Winifred is shown to be confused and overwhelmed with her family and her role in it. It is hinted that she did not <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same strict manor as her husband, perhaps she did not even have a nanny as a child, and is not from this area, which makes it difficult for her to connect and make friends. In the original books, she has five children instead of two, including the twins, John and Barbara, and later a baby, Annabel.|$|E

500|$|Before her own marriage, Stone {{felt that}} women {{should be allowed to}} divorce drunken husbands, to {{formally}} end a [...] "loveless marriage" [...] so that [...] "a true love may <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> soul of the injured one from the full enjoyment of which no legal bond had a right to keep her ...Whatever is pure and holy, not only has a right to be, but it has a right also to be recognized, and further, I think it has no right not to be recognized." [...] Stone's friends often felt differently about the issue; [...] "Nettee" [...] Brown wrote to Stone in 1853 that she was not ready to accept the idea, even if both parties wanted divorce. Stanton was less inclined to clerical orthodoxy; she was very much in favor of giving women the right to divorce, eventually coming to the view that the reform of marriage laws was more important than women's voting rights.|$|E
500|$|The pro-Church accounts, by contrast, {{described}} a boy very much resolved {{to stay where}} he was, and horrified by his mother's exhortations {{to return to the}} Judaism of his ancestors. In this narrative, the main reason for the Mortaras' grief was not that their son had been taken, but that he now stood to <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Christian faith. According to La Civiltà Cattolica, Marianna flew into a rage on seeing a medallion hanging from Edgardo's neck bearing the image of the Virgin Mary, and ripped it off; one article {{went so far as to}} claim the Jewish mother had done this with the words: [...] "I'd rather see you dead than a Christian!" [...] Some of the Church's critics had charged that by keeping Edgardo, it was violating the commandment that a child should honour his father and mother—La Civiltà Cattolica countered that Edgardo still loved his family despite their religious differences and indeed, after being taught by the priests to read and write, had chosen to write his first letter to his mother, signing it [...] "your most affectionate little son". Louis Veuillot, the ultramontane editor of the L'Univers newspaper and one of the Pope's staunchest defenders, reported after meeting Edgardo in Rome that the boy had told him [...] "that he loves his father and his mother, and that he will go to live with them when he is older... so that he can speak to them of Saint Peter, of God, and of the most Holy Mary." ...|$|E

2500|$|From {{the later}} 1960s Keeping, {{alongside}} illustrators like Brian Wildsmith and John Burningham, {{took advantage of}} advances in printing technology to move from black and white work to adventurous colour techniques.

He followed these with Charley, Charlotte and the Golden Canary, a modern fairy tale about two children who <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same street, are separated when one family moves to a new tower block, and are reunited thanks to a pet canary, which depicts the gradual disappearance of the London of Keeping's childhood, a theme he would persistently revisit.

2500|$|One {{criticism}} of Strauss and Howe's theory, {{and the field}} of [...] "generational studies" [...] in general, is that conclusions are overly broad and {{do not reflect the}} reality of every person in each generation regardless of their race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, disability, or genetic information For example, Hoover cited the case of Millennials by writing that [...] "commentators have tended to slap the Millennial label on white, affluent teenagers who accomplish great things as they <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> suburbs, who confront anxiety when applying to super-selective colleges, and who multitask with ease as their helicopter parents hover reassuringly above them. The label tends not to appear in renderings of teenagers who happen to be minorities, or poor, or who have never won a spelling bee. Nor does the term often refer to students from big cities and small towns that are nothing like Fairfax County, Va. Or who lack technological know-how. Or who struggle to complete high school.

With {{the advent of the}} French Revolutionary Wars, Amherst was recalled as Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in January 1793: however is generally criticised for allowing the armed forces to slide into acute decline, a direct cause of the failure of the early campaigns in the Low Countries: Pitt the Younger said of him [...] "his age, and perhaps his natural temper, are little suited to the activity and the energy which the present moment calls for". Horace Walpole called him [...] "that log of wood whose stupidity and incapacity are past belief". [...] "He allowed innumerable abuses to <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> army… He kept his command, though almost in his dotage, with a tenacity that cannot be too much censured".

2500|$|Muslim hip hop {{has also}} become {{increasingly}} popular, especially as Islam has spread to, and begun to establish itself in, the United States. [...] As young Muslims <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> American culture, they are being exposed to ideas and beliefs that earlier generations of Muslims never came into contact with. [...] This {{has led to a}} new wave of Muslims trying to reconcile their faith with their country's cultural practices. [...] Out of this tension have risen new forms of Islamic creative expression, including hip hop. [...] Two Muslim hip hop artists who bring up the concept of polygyny in their music are Miss Undastood and Sons of Hagar. [...] "Miss Undastood, a young veiled, African-American lyricist, raps on her CD Dunya or Deen (Life or Faith) about war, love, the challenges of being a young Muslim woman in America, and the power of faith." [...] One of Miss Undastood's songs, [...] "Co-Wife," [...] criminalizes men who practice polygyny for the wrong reasons: out of lust or when they are financially unstable. Ultimately, though, Miss Undastood believes that Islamic polygyny is justifiable. Sons of Hagar is another hip hop group that seeks to positively portray Islam in their lyrics and support Islamic practices in their actions. [...] Their song, [...] "Sisterssss," [...] supports polygynous practices. [...] The members of the group rationalize that even though polygyny is illegal in America, rapping about it is much less offensive than when other artists rap about prostitutes.|$|E

2500|$|Gould {{pointed out}} that if the genetic {{heritability}} of IQ were demonstrable within a given racial or ethnic group, it would not explain the causes of IQ differences among the people of a group, or if said IQ differences {{can be attributed to}} the environment. For example, the height of a person is genetically determined, but there exist height differences within a given social group that can be attributed to environmental factors (e.g. the quality of nutrition) and to genetic inheritance. The evolutionary biologist Richard Lewontin, a colleague of Gould’s, is a proponent of this argument in relation to IQ tests. An example of the intellectual confusion about what heritability is and is not, is the statement: [...] "If all environments were to become equal for everyone, heritability would rise to 100 percent because all remaining differences in IQ would necessarily be genetic in origin", which Gould said is misleading, at best, and false, at worst. First, it is very difficult to conceive of a world wherein every man, woman, and child grew up in the same environment, because their spatial and temporal dispersion upon the planet Earth makes it impossible. Second, were people to <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same environment, not every difference would be genetic in origin because of the randomness of molecular and genetic development. Therefore, heritability is not a measure of phenotypic (physiognomy and physique) differences among racial and ethnic groups, but of differences between genotype and phenotype in a given population.|$|E
2500|$|Soap Opera Digest {{revealed}} that Yancey's Cameron {{would play a}} key role in the upcoming storyline featuring Celeste Perrault (Beverly Todd) and Lexie Carver (Renée Jones). According to Owens, with the recast, the character of Cameron would develop an edge and bring more excitement; not unstable, just edgier. In an interview with Soapdom.com, Owens {{revealed that}} Cameron has issues that need to be explored. The actor explained that the character has [...] "skeletons" [...] in his closet and those secrets will eventually bring him to a breaking point. Owens drew on personal experience to help him prepare for the role as he also faced issues with his family — Cameron has to develop a sense of family and what it means to him because he does not <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> [...] "ideal" [...] family. Owens also avoided seeing clips of Yancey's portrayal to make sure he could put his own spin on the character. However, he did take the opportunity to learn more about the cast members and Days as a whole. Cameron wants a relationship with the his late sister, Lexie's family, the DiMeras because he longs for familial acceptance, something he did not grow up with. According to Owens, Cameron has strong feelings for Abigail and does not see her ex, Chad DiMera (Casey Jon Deidrick) as an obstacle. Owens revealed that he hoped for the chance to work with the veteran Mascolo as Stefano.|$|E
2500|$|The Improper Use of Magic Office is {{responsible}} for investigating offences under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery and the International Confederation of Wizards' Statute of Secrecy. They regulate an under-age wizard's or witch's use of magic and prohibit wizards and witches from performing magic {{in the presence of}} Muggles or in a Muggle-inhabited area in the Harry Potter universe. An enchantment called [...] "the Trace" [...] is placed upon children and helps the department detect offences; it breaks when they reach the age of 17. However, Dumbledore explains to Harry that the Ministry cannot tell who exactly uses magic in a given area, only that it has been used. This can be seen as unfair to young witches and wizards {{who grew up in the}} muggle-world (such as muggle born wizards or those with one magical and one muggle-parent) as they are more likely to be caught using magic than those who <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wizard world. Those living in the muggle-world generally have no contact with other witches or wizards away from school and the Ministry simply presumes that any magic performed where they are is an act of under-age wizardry, while at the same time presuming that any magic performed in a wizard home that has minors present was performed by those aged 17 and over. This means that minors living in the wizard world have a much greater chance of escaping punishment for the use of under-age magic. The Ministry has to rely on wizard and witch parents to enforce the ban on under-age magic within their homes.|$|E
