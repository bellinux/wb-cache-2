Realising this, Anjali is {{hesitant}} to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> the marriage, and stands weeping. Aman notices the {{tears in her eyes}} and realises that she has always been in love with Rahul. He releases Anjali from the engagement and tells her to marry Rahul.

5|$|Independence {{talks between}} Britain and Rhodesia {{continued}} for a fortnight without major {{reference to the}} Reedman appointment, with Britain more concerned with discussing a possible Rhodesian unilateral declaration of independence (UDI). Smith delivered an openly defiant speech to his parliament on 30 June, attacking Britain for its handling of the Commonwealth's newer members, which he said were unduly influencing British policy in Africa. Britain was desperate to avoid the international humiliation that would accompany the organisation's break-up, he claimed, and was therefore attempting to hold it together by appeasing the less prominent members. While making clear his disdain, the Prime Minister pledged to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> negotiations, saying {{that he did not}} believe Britain truly endorsed its professed line.|$|E
5|$|Areobindus {{was murdered}} by Guntharic, but Artabanes secured {{guarantees}} of his safety and pledged himself to Guntharic's service. In secret, however, he began planning to overthrow him. Soon after, Artabanes was entrusted, alongside John and Ulitheus, with an expedition against Antalas's Moors. He marched south, along with an allied Moorish contingent under Cutzinas. Antalas's men fled before him, but Artabanes did not pursue them and turned back. According to Procopius, he considered leading his men to join the loyalist imperial garrison that held out at Hadrumetum under Marcentius, but {{decided to return to}} Carthage and <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> his plan to assassinate Guntharic. Artabanes kept his plan in absolute secrecy for a long time, confiding only with his two closest Armenian friends: even his Armenian unit of hand-picked and completely loyal veteran soldiers was not aware of it until the very last moment. Such a perfect concealment was achieved, not least thanks to the fact that during both planning and implementation stages of this assassination the communication between the exclusively Armenian conspirators was in their mother tongue, an incomprehensible language for other ethnic elements of the imperial army in Africa.|$|E

Stage and screen veteran Florence Henderson and Vilanch teamed for An Evening with Friends in 2010. The show featured Henderson sharing songs and stories from her career on stage, screen, and television. Vilanch had a longstanding friendship with Henderson, writing for her one-woman show {{as well as}} several of The Brady Bunch Variety Hour episodes in the early 1980s.|$|E
25|$|This {{arises in}} the {{following}} way. We never need four colors in a neighborhood unless there be four counties, {{each of which has}} boundary lines in common with each of the other three. Such a thing cannot happen with four areas unless one or more of them be inclosed by the rest; and the color used for the inclosed county is thus set free to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with.</b> Now this principle, that four areas cannot each have common boundary with all the other three without inclosure, is not, we fully believe, capable of demonstration upon anything more evident and more elementary; it must stand as a postulate.|$|E
25|$|In August the 29th Indian Brigade was {{secretly}} moved from Helles to ANZAC Cove, but {{were greeted by}} shellfire on landing on 5 August, {{and part of the}} 14th Sikhs had to wait until the next night to land. They then took part in the Battle of Sari Bair on 7 August alongside Australian troops, all under Cox's command. Palin commanded one of the four attacking columns, but like Cox and the other commanders was provided with no staff and the objectives set for them were beyond attainment. 14th Sikhs got onto Rhododendron Spur and made contact with 4th Australian Brigade on their flank. The Australians were ordered to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> the Sikhs and assault Hill 305 (Koja Chemen Tepe), but it was found to be impossible. In the subsequent attempt to capture Hill 60, the artillery preparation was again inadequate, casualties were very heavy, and the objective remained untaken.|$|E

25|$|In some competitions, {{the game}} cannot {{end in a}} draw, so away goals, extra time and kicks from the penalty mark are the three methods for {{determining}} the winner after a match has been drawn. Away goals mean that if the team's score is level after playing one home and one away game, the goals scored in the away match count as double. Extra time consists of two periods of five minutes. If no winner is produced after these methods, 3 kicks from the penalty mark are taken, and the team that has scored the most wins. If it is not decided after 3 kicks from the penalty mark, it continues to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> one extra kick from the penalty mark to each team {{at a time until}} one of them has scored more goals than the other. Unlike extra time, the goals scored in a shoot-out do not count towards the goals scored throughout the match.|$|E
25|$|The related {{concept of}} {{maternal}} mind-mindedness assesses the mother's {{ability to understand}} and verbalize the infant's mind: thoughts, desires, intentions and memories. Maternal mind-mindedness {{has been found to}} be related to some developmental results, such as attachment security. A caregiver's comment is deemed an appropriate mind-related comment if the comment was deemed to match the infant's behaviour by the independent coder, if the comment associated the infant's current activity to past activities, and/or if the comment encouraged the infant to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> his or her intentions when the conversation paused. This correlates to high maternal mind-mindedness. If the caregiver assigns the wrong internal state to the baby's behaviour, if the comment about the current activity is not insufficiently associated with a past event, if the comment deters the infant from proceeding with the current activity, and/or if the comment is unclear, it is deemed a in-appropriate mind-related comment and correlates to low mind-mindedness.|$|E
25|$|Hughes {{dismissal}} in {{the morning}} session left Australia 331 for 7, and England should have knocked {{over the last few}} wickets, but their inability to clean up the Australian tail cost them dearly. First Trevor Hohns with 21 off 38 balls, and then fast bowler Geoff Lawson with a career best of 74 off 94 balls provided the lower tail support Steve Waugh needed to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> his innings. As the impetus of Waugh's innings grew, Lawson contented himself with spectating from the bowler's end, and playing defensively when he had to, although the 11 fours he struck during his innings testified to his ability to pick off the bad balls that were bowled to him. Lawson eventually fell to Emburey's off-spin for 74, but the damage had been done as he had supported Waugh to guide the Australian's past 500. With the fall of Terry Alderman's wicket, Australia ware all out for 528, a first innings lead of 242, with Steve Waugh once again not out on 152.|$|E

25|$|On the {{run down}} to the first chicane Alesi slowed with an {{electrical}} problem and retired in the pits, but also blocked Katayama, allowing both Schumacher and Hill to attack. Schumacher went through but Hill hit Katayama, damaging his front wing. Coulthard had to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> a damaged car for an extra lap while the team put a new wing on Hill's car and sent him away. Brundle and Coulthard also rejoined after repairs as Berger was leading from Schumacher, Katayama, Olivier Panis, Bernard and Fittipaldi. Katayama retired on lap 7 with throttle troubles as Verstappen passed Fittipaldi. It {{was time for the}} stops and Verstappen retired with a spectacular fire as fuel spilled onto the bodywork of the car. He managed to escape relatively uninjured but the car was reduced to a smoldering wreck. The incident served to highlight the dangers of refuelling now it had been re-introduced to the sport, and paved the way for future safety measures. Schumacher retired on lap 20 with an engine failure.|$|E
25|$|Yadav (0) {{was caught}} behind early on Day 4 and Shami (12) was out shortly after as India were bowled out for 465. David Warner started quickly as Australia's lead raced to 100 {{before he was}} adgudged lbw off Ashwin (40). Shane Watson (15*) and Chris Rogers (33*) {{continued}} until lunch with the score at 1/90, a lead of 155. Rain delayed the middle session {{for an hour and}} shortly after the interval, Watson (17) was caught behind off the bowling of Sharma. Steve Smith looked good at the crease as Rogers brought up his 4th consecutive fifty, until Smith was caught at leg slip for 14. Shaun Marsh and Rogers put on a good 33-run stand before Rogers (69) once again didn't <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> his fifty and make a big score when he played on off Ashwin. Joe Burns and Marsh lasted until tea at 4/174, leading by 239 runs. Marsh and Burns started slowly after tea and Burns was caught behind (9). Brad Haddin (13) was also caught behind not long after. Mitchell Johnson started slowly and threw away his wicket when he was caught at mid-wicket (15) as Marsh brought up a half-century. Ryan Harris (8*) and Marsh (62*) guided Australia to 7/261 at stumps, a lead of 326 runs.|$|E
25|$|After the 31 July decision, {{contempt}} of court notices were issued to the judges who took the Provisional Constitutional Order oath. On 9 November 2010, a four-member Supreme Court bench took up the {{contempt of}} court charges against the nine justices who have not apologised for taking the oath. Although these judges petitioned the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court rejected the petitions and will <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> the {{contempt of court}} proceedings. Objections to {{the composition of the}} bench were raised by Justice Abdul Baist against the presence of Justices Sair Ali, Tariq Pervez, and Shahid Siddiqui. Following these objections, Ali refused {{to be part of the}} bench and requested Chaudhry create a new bench to hear the case. On 11 December 2010, Dogar also challenged the bench presiding over the case, on the grounds that two of the judges making up the bench had been appointed per his recommendation. However, this challenge was rejected. On 3 March 2011, Dogar and Zahid Hussain apologised to the Supreme Court. Chaudhry accepted their apologies. The Supreme Court has asked Attorney General Maulvi Anwar ul Haq to provide a statement on behalf of the government detailing the legal status of the judges who took the oath.|$|E
