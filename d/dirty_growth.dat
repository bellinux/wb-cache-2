40|$|Economy: Comparing California {{before and}} after the 1970 passage of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), and {{benchmarking}} against performance in the other 49 states, this study finds that 1) California per capita GDP, 2) California housing relative to population, 3) California manufacturing output and 4) California construction activity grew as fast or faster after the passage of CEQA. Environment: In the specific case of power plant construction, since 1970, California shifted to less polluting natural gas electrical generation sooner and went farther in this direction compared {{to the rest of the}} U. S. California also shifted sooner (in the 1980 s and thereafter) and has gone farther in its reliance upon renewable and other non-traditional energy sources to generate electricity compared to the rest of the U. S. Case Studies: Three case studies are presented. First, CEQA's role in the ending of proposals to build coal-fired power plants in California helped introduce the first significant corporateutility commitments to non-hydroelectric renewable energy generation in the U. S. Second, CEQA's role in helping shift the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach from a model of <b>dirty</b> <b>growth</b> to a model of green growth, first through the land-side electrification of docked ships (beginning in 2003), and then, as one legal basis for the ports' Clean Air Action Plan (2006), resulted in reversing a projected doubling of port pollution from 2000 to 2020 to a 40 % to 80 % reduction in port pollution from 2005 to 2011. Third, CEQA's role in stimulating a California Energy Commission policy (2003) of discouraging wet cooling and encouraging the dry cooling of inland natural gas power plants helped stop a licensing practice which over the decade 1996 to 2005 had committed 100, 000 acre feet of fresh and recycled water to wet cooling of inland thermal power plants...|$|E
60|$|The {{light of}} the bit of candle fell upon a round, hook-nosed face with black moustaches and little side-whiskers. He was {{extremely}} <b>dirty.</b> A greasy <b>growth</b> of beard was sprouting on the shaven parts of the cheeks. The thick lips were slightly parted, but the eyes remained closed. Decoud, to his immense astonishment, recognized Senor Hirsch, the hide merchant from Esmeralda. Nostromo, too, had recognized him. And they gazed at {{each other across the}} body, lying with its naked feet higher than its head, in an absurd pretence of sleep, faintness, or death.|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates privately and {{socially}} optimal patterns {{of economic development}} in a two-sector endogenous growth model with clean and dirty goods. We consider a second-best fiscal policy framework in which distortionary taxes jointly influence economic growth and environmental quality. In this policy setting, three conditions produce an Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) : (i) dirty output is bounded; (ii) clean output grows endogenously; and (iii) <b>growth</b> in the <b>dirty</b> sector reduces <b>growth</b> in the clean sector. These conditions do not arise with a consumption externality, but can emerge with a production externality. Endogenous labor supply implications are also investigated. Although not necessary for producing an EKC, endogenous labor supply provides additional linkages that produce an EKC under circumstances in which it would otherwise not appear...|$|R
40|$|Early weaned pigs allotted either into “clean ” or into “dirty ” {{environmental}} conditions and potentially subject to {{high or low}} levels of antigen exposure, respectively, {{were used to determine}} the impact of 0,. 67, 1. 33, and 2 % conjugated linoleic acid (CLA- 60) on the immune status and growth performance. CLA levels modulate immune status in weanling pigs by decreasing the CD 4 +:CD 8 + ratio due to an increase in CD 8 + and a decrease in CD 4 +%. If the result of that ratio is favorable to the numerator, it means that the animal has a greater immune potential to fight against bacterial-type infections (serum antibodies produced by plasma cells) than against viral or other intracellular-type infections. The increase in CD 8 + indicates a potential increase in cytotoxic T lymphocytes. These cells {{play an important role in}} the development of the response of the animal against viral infections. CLA caused an increase in alpha- 1 -acylglycoprotein (AGP), a serum acute-phase protein produced in the liver in response to stimulation from specific cytokines. No statistical significance in feed efficiency was attributed to CLA. Pigs placed into the clean environment utilized feed more efficiently than those placed in the <b>dirty</b> environment. <b>Growth</b> performance was shown to be independent of dietary treatments, but after a period of 42 days, pigs fed CLA become more viral immune competent than control animals...|$|R
40|$|Hong Kong-based author Mark L. Clifford {{provides}} a behind-the-scenes {{look at what}} companies in China, India, Japan, Korea, the Philippines, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Thailand are doing to build businesses that will lessen {{the environmental impact of}} Asia's extraordinary economic <b>growth.</b> <b>Dirty</b> air, foul water, and hellishly overcrowded cities are threatening to choke the region's impressive prosperity. Recognizing a business opportunity in solving social problems, Asian businesses have developed innovative responses to the region's environmental crises. From solar and wind power technologies to green buildings, electric cars, water services, and sustainable tropical forestry, Asian corporations are upending old business models in their home countries and throughout the world. Companies have the money, the technology, and the people to act [...] yet, as Clifford emphasizes, support from the government (in the form of more effective, market-friendly policies) and the engagement of civil society are crucial for a region-wide shift to greener business practices. Clifford paints detailed profiles of what some of these companies are doing and includes a unique appendix that encapsulates the environmental business practices of more than fifty companies mentioned in the book...|$|R
40|$|In 1899, MacCallum and Hastings {{isolated}} from the blood and organs of a person dying of acute endocarditis an organism which they described and named Micrococcus zymogenes. It produced tiny, smooth, glistening, white colonies on agar plate cultures. Morphologically the organism {{was found to be}} a minute coccus, often somewhat elongated, occurring in masses, singly, and in pairs or short chains of pairs. It was non-motile, non-encap-sulated and Gram-positive. It grew well in glycerol- or ascitic-fluid-agar and other nutrient media. Glucose and lactose were fermented with the formation of acid but no gas. Litmus was reduced. A thin, <b>dirty</b> white, pasty <b>growth</b> appeared irregu-larly on potato. No indol was formed in nutrient bouillon. The organism was a facultative anaerobe and resisted drying on agar slants for months. The proteolytic power of the organism was one of its most conspicuous properties. Gelatine was liquified, coagulated seruim was digested, and milk was first coagulated and then digested. The coagulation was thought to be due to a rennin-like enzyme, in part, at least. The changes produced in litmus milk were regarded as unusual and very characteristic. Sterile filtrates of broth cultures produced proteolysis similar to, but not so ex-tensive as, that caused by the live organisms themselves. The micrococcus was found to be pathogenic for rabbits and white mice. Intraperitoneal injections of 0. 3 to 0. 7 cc. of brot...|$|R
