5|$|Because the feats the Baron {{describes}} are overtly implausible, {{they are}} easily recognizable as fiction, {{with a strong}} implication that the Baron <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>liar.</b> Whether he expects his audience to believe him varies from version to version; in Raspe's original 1785 text, he simply narrates his stories without further comment, but in the later extended versions he is insistent that he is telling the truth. In any case, the Baron appears to believe every word of his own stories, no matter how internally inconsistent they become, and he usually appears tolerantly indifferent to any disbelief he encounters in others.|$|E
5|$|The Bible {{is central}} in Zwingli's {{work as a}} {{reformer}} and is crucial {{in the development of}} his theology. Zwingli appealed to scripture constantly in his writings. This is strongly evident in his early writings such as Archeteles (1522) and llarity and Certainty of the Word of God (1522). He believed that man <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>liar</b> and only God is the truth. For him scripture, as God's word, brings light when there is only darkness of error.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, Ben tells Jack {{that they}} had a perfect plan to convince Jack to operate on Ben's spine, but it failed when Jack saw the X-rays. Afterwards, Juliet brings to Jack's cell a movie, which consists of Juliet speaking through cue cards. As Juliet discusses how the surgery will proceed, on the tape she tells Jack that Ben <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>liar</b> and very dangerous, and thus the surgery should be intentionally botched to kill Ben, and that she will protect Jack if he does so.|$|E

In a preview for the episode, Vicky Power of The Daily Telegraph said that [...] "as usual there's a large body count and fist-fights, but these are {{tempered}} by scenes of high emotion", and if the episode were Ros' last, [...] "it is a fitting send-off". David Chater of The Times was positive towards the episode, stating [...] "just in case you think you're having an exhausting time {{in the run-up to}} Christmas, spare a thought for Lucas North [...] his lover <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>liar,</b> a murderer and a traitor", and also noted that [...] "the great thing about Spooks is that they will always stop and explain how serious things are".|$|E
500|$|The game {{features}} two characters: the player-controlled silent protagonist named Chell, and GLaDOS (Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System), {{a computer}} artificial intelligence that monitors and directs the player. In the English-language version, GLaDOS is voiced by Ellen McLain, though her voice has been altered to sound more artificial. The only background information presented about Chell {{is given by}} GLaDOS; the credibility of these facts, such as Chell being adopted, an orphan, and having no friends, is questionable at best, as GLaDOS <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>liar</b> by her own admission. In the [...] "Lab Rat" [...] comic created by Valve {{to bridge the gap}} between Portal and Portal 2, Chell's records reveal she was ultimately rejected as a test subject for having [...] "too much tenacity"—the main reason Doug Rattman, a former employee of Aperture Science, moved Chell to the top of the test queue.|$|E

2500|$|Harold Lindsell {{points out}} that it is a [...] "gross distortion" [...] to state that people who believe in biblical inerrancy suppose every {{statement}} made in the Bible is true (opposed to accurate).

Proponents of biblical inerrancy generally do not teach that the Bible was dictated directly by God, but that God used the [...] "distinctive personalities and literary styles of the writers" [...] of scripture and that God's inspiration guided them to flawlessly project his message through their own language and personality.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, {{seven years}} after Shahak's death, the {{controversy}} of religious interpretation continued when Rabbi Shmuley Boteach doubted the veracity of Shahak's report of Jewish injustice against a non-Jew: [...] "From the beginning, the story was curious. What prohibition could there possibly be, in allowing someone else to use one's phone on the Sabbath?" [...] In support, he cited Eli Beer, the chief coordinator of Israel's volunteer ambulance service (1,100 medical personnel, 60 per cent Orthodox), who said, [...] "If someone would say we won't save a non-Jewish life on the Sabbath, he <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>liar.</b> If he is Jewish, Christian, or Muslim we save everyone's life on {{any day of the}} year, including the Sabbath and Yom Kippur, and I have done so myself.

2500|$|The Catholic Church {{teaches that}} [...] "A lie {{consists}} in speaking a falsehood {{with the intention}} of deceiving." [...] According to the Bible, the Lord denounces lying as the work of the devil: [...] "You are of your father the devil, [...] [...] [...] there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks according to his own nature, for he <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>liar</b> and the father of lies." [...] (John 8:44) [...] Lying is the most direct offense against the truth. To lie is to speak or act against the truth in order to lead someone into error. By injuring man's relation to truth and to his neighbor, a lie offends against the fundamental relation of man and of his word to the Lord. [...] Lying is a mortal sin when it does grave injury to the virtues of justice and charity. [...] Lying is a profanation of speech, whereas the purpose of speech is to communicate known truth to others. The deliberate intention of leading a neighbor into error by saying things contrary to the truth constitutes a failure in justice and charity. The culpability is greater when the intention of deceiving entails the risk of deadly consequences for those who are led astray. [...] By violating the virtue of truthfulness, a lie does real violence to another. It affects his ability to know, which is a condition of every judgment and decision. It contains the seed of discord and all consequent evils. Lying is destructive of society; it undermines trust among men and tears apart the fabric of social relationships.|$|E
