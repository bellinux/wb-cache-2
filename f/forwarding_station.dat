40|$|Abstract:- An ad-hoc {{wireless}} {{sensor network}} is also called self-organized networking that wireless sensor nodes can automatically communicate for each other. Therefore, each sensor node {{is no need for}} the information such as location of each sensor. Similarly, it consumes much energy on the information exchanged of each sensor node {{in order to maintain the}} entire ad-hoc {{wireless sensor network}} alive. Therefore, there are totally three phases in this paper. First, the setup phase is that all sensor nodes are randomly deployed and the ad-hoc wireless sensor network is divided into many clusters in each round. Therefore, every cluster has only one cluster head. Second, each sensor node transmits its message to the cluster head where it belongs to and then the cluster head transmits the messages coming from sensor nodes and deliver it to <b>forwarding</b> <b>station.</b> Finally, the <b>forwarding</b> <b>station</b> forwards the integrated messages from all cluster heads back to the base station. However, it consumes less energy for all cluster heads to transmit directly back to the base station. Hence, the far away location of the base station usually consumes the cluster head much energy to transmit the message to the base station. With the proposed three-phase scheme, the ad-hoc wireless network lifetime can be extended very well. Also, the simulation results show the entire ad-hoc wireless network lifetime can be extended very well...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- An ad-hoc {{wireless}} {{sensor network}} organizes itself as a network that many sensor nodes automatically communicate {{each other in a}} certain area. Each sensor node consists of a transmitting unit, receiving unit, central processing unit, and battery unit. Because of the sensor node’s battery unit that may not be reachable or rechargeable, it is important for both the base station and sensor nodes communicating very well for less energy consumption of sensor nodes to extend the entire ad-hoc {{wireless sensor network}} lifetime. Moreover, in this paper, the ad-hoc wireless sensor network is divided into many clusters and every cluster contains only one cluster head. All wireless sensor nodes will transmit their messages to the cluster head where they belong to. Then, the cluster head will return a confirmed message back to every sensor. However, it dissipates much energy to retransmit a confirmed message from the cluster head to the sensor node. Since the base station is far away from the sensed area, it is necessary to have a <b>forwarding</b> <b>station</b> forwarding the message from the sensed area to the base station. Finally, this paper proposes the <b>forwarding</b> <b>station</b> integrated the non-confirmed routing protocol so that the network lifetime can be extended very well. Also, simulation results show the network lifetime extended well and the performance is much better...|$|E
40|$|Abstract − The {{emergence}} of nomadic applications have recently generated {{a lot of}} interest in next generation wireless network infrastructures (e. g., the 3 G EGPRS (Enhanced Gen-eral Packet Radio Services), UMTS/IMT- 2000, etc.) which provide differentiated service classes. So it is important to study how the Quality of Service (QoS), such as packet loss and bandwidth, should be guaranteed. To accomplish this, we develop an admission control scheme which can guarantee bandwidth for real-time applications in multihop mobile net-works. In our scheme, a host need not discover and maintain any information of the network resources status on the routes to another host until a connection request is generated for the communication between the two hosts, unless the former host is offering its services as an intermediate <b>forwarding</b> <b>station</b> to maintain connectivity between two other hosts.
