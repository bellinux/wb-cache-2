5|$|A toxin-antitoxin system <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> two or {{more closely}} linked genes that {{together}} encode both a protein 'poison' and a corresponding 'antidote'. When these systems are contained on plasmids– transferable genetic elements– they ensure that only the daughter cells that inherit the plasmid survive after cell division. If the plasmid is absent in a daughter cell, the unstable antitoxin is degraded and the stable toxic protein kills the new cell; {{this is known as}} 'post-segregational killing' (PSK). Toxin-antitoxin systems are widely distributed in prokaryotes, and organisms often have them in multiple copies.|$|E

The result of the weaving process <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> classes with the same names as the original classes but with additional code injected into the classes' functions automatically.

The book became Christian Science's central text, along with the Bible, and by 2001 had sold over nine million copies.|$|E
5|$|Dualism <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> {{views about}} the {{relationship}} between mind and matter (or body). It begins with the claim that mental phenomena are, in some respects, non-physical. One of the earliest known formulations of mind–body dualism was expressed in the eastern Sankhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy (c. 650 BCE), which divided the world into purusha (mind/spirit) and prakriti (material substance). Specifically, the Yoga Sutra of Patanjali presents an analytical approach {{to the nature of the}} mind.|$|E

5|$|Hygiene <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> {{practices}} to avoid infection or food spoilage by eliminating microorganisms from the surroundings. As microorganisms, in particular bacteria, are found virtually everywhere, harmful microorganisms {{may be reduced}} to acceptable levels rather than actually eliminated. In food preparation, microorganisms are reduced by preservation methods such as cooking, cleanliness of utensils, short storage periods, or by low temperatures. If complete sterility is needed, as with surgical equipment, an autoclave is used to kill microorganisms with heat and pressure.|$|E

5|$|In {{computer}} science, Putnam {{is known}} for the Davis–Putnam algorithm for the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT), developed with Martin Davis in 1960. The algorithm finds if there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> true or false values that satisfies a given Boolean expression so that the entire expression becomes true. In 1962, they further refined the algorithm {{with the help of}} George Logemann and Donald W. Loveland. It became known as the DPLL algorithm. This algorithm is efficient and still forms the basis of most complete SAT solvers.|$|E

5|$|A finite field <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> {{numbers with}} four {{generalized}} operations. The operations are called addition, subtraction, multiplication and division {{and have their}} usual properties, such as commutativity, associativity and distributivity. An example of a finite field is the set of 13 numbers {0,1,2,…,12} using modular arithmetic. In this field, the results of any mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) is reduced modulo 13; that is, multiples of 13 are added or subtracted until the result is brought within the range 0–12. For example, the result of 5×7=35mod13=9. Such finite fields can be defined for any prime p; using more sophisticated definitions, {{they can also be}} defined for any power m of a prime p'm. Finite fields are often called Galois fields, and are abbreviated as GF(p) or GF(p'm).|$|E
