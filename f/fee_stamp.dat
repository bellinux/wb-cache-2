50|$|The first Trinidad {{revenue was}} issued in 1887 and {{consisted}} of a 1d postage stamp of 1883 overprinted FEE. Other values were prepared but none were issued, since later that year a new set with values from ½d to 5s was issued.

On July 15 the rate was dropped to 16 cents for the first ounce and 6 cents for each additional ounce, and on December 15 the rate was dropped again to 6 cents per ounce when Special Delivery was made optional.

50|$|For {{the general}} public, stamp {{production}} {{became the most}} well-known activity of State Printing House over the decades. After the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, the Hungarian government {{found it necessary to}} pay for the postal and office fees with its own stamp in order to emphasize national sovereignty and for financial and administration reasons. Previously, these fees could be paid for only by parallel-published (Austrian-Hungarian) stamps which were produced in Vienna. The <b>fee</b> <b>stamps</b> were produced in Hungary from 1869, in the State Printing House managed by the independent Finance Ministry. The provision of the 1867 Compromise concerning postal services came into effect on 1 May. All of the post offices on the territory of Hungary came under the competence of the Hungarian Post Directorate. So a natural claim came forward that independently published Hungarian stamps should be put on the mails of the Hungarian Post. As this claim was approved by the emperor’s government, the first Hungarian newspaper stamp was published on 20 June 1868. However, this was printed in the Viennese printing house and a German inscription could be read on the watermark. The inscription on the stamp itself was Hungarian, and the stamp design was decorated by the Hungarian coat of arms and crown. The first postal stamp produced in Hungary was issued in 1871 after the stamp production line of State Printing House was developed.|$|R
