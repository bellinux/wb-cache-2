50|$|CHS {{activities}} include grain merchandising and transportation, sunflower and soybean processing, wholesale fertilizer, animal feed production and sale, and various farm supply. It {{is also the}} manufacturer of Cenex brand gasoline and diesel products from refineries in Laurel, Montana and McPherson, Kansas. Through wholly owned subsidiaries, it sells property/casualty insurance, group health benefits, agricultural financing and commodity brokerage services. CHS also has {{a joint venture with}} Mitsui & Co. called Ventura Foods, LLC, that manufactures and distributes vegetable-oil based products such as margarine and cooking oil. Ventura Foods owns and distributes the consumer brands <b>Homade</b> Chili Sauce, Dean's Dips and Marie's Dressings.|$|E
5000|$|Grace Arents remodeled the {{building}} and had a second story added. It {{was used as a}} convalescent home for Richmond's sick children. After the founding of the Instructional Visiting Nurses Association, the convalescent home was no longer needed. Arents and Mary Garland Smith moved into the mansion and named it Bloemendaal in <b>homade</b> to the Ginter family's Dutch ancestors (Bloemendaal means [...] "valley of flowers" [...] and she planted gardens on the property). She died in 1926 and left the property to the City of Richmond with the stipulation that after Smith died it was to be developed in a botanical garden honoring Lewis Ginter.|$|E
40|$|FPGAs {{support the}} {{implementation}} {{of a wide range of}} functionalities, from general-purpose processors (Softcores) to dedicated hardware accelerators (Intellectual Properties). This blurs the traditional line between software and hardware, since in many cases a functionality can be achieved either by executing code on a softcore or by running an IP. In this paper we focus on programming parallel architectures where IPs are interconnected using softcores. We propose a programming language, called HiHope, which exploits this kind of architecture. HiHope includes constructs for switching at runtime between hardware functions (implemented by IPs) and software functions in a transparent way. It also contains constructs for executing parallel functions (either hardware or software ones) and for redefining functions dynamically. We show how HiHope programs can be compiled for execution on master-slave parallel architectures based on the <b>HoMade</b> processor, a softcore processor designed as an IP integrator...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOne goal of {{reconfiguration}} {{is to save}} {{power and}} occupied resources. In this paper we compare two different kinds of reconfiguration available on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) and we discuss their pros and cons. The first method that we study is circuit merging. This type of reconfiguration methods consists in sharing common resources between different circuits. The second method that we explore is dynamic partial reconfiguration (DPR). It is specific to some FPGA, allowing well defined reconfigurable parts to be modified during run-time. We show that DPR, when available, has good and more predictable result in terms of occupied area. There is still a huge overhead in term of time and power consumption during the reconfiguration phase. Therefore we show that circuit merging remains an interesting solution on FPGA {{because it is not}} vendor specific and the reconfiguration time is around a clock cycle. Besides, good merging algorithms exist even-though FPGA physical synthesis flow makes it hard to predict the real performance of the merged circuit during the optimization. We establish our comparison {{in the context of the}} <b>HoMade</b> processor...|$|E
