5|$|Adults {{make their}} homes within holes in various {{mangrove}} trees and maintain an arboreal existence whereas the young are strictly terrestrial {{for the first}} year of their lives.

After digging their nest burrows and laying their eggs, the females abandon the nests and return to the mangroves. Sixty to seventy-four days later the hatchlings emerge and move back to the swamps.|$|E
5|$|Borax, its mineral form {{then known}} as tincal, glazes were used in China from AD 300, and some crude borax reached the West, where the Persian alchemist Jābir ibn Hayyān {{apparently}} mentioned it in AD 700. Marco Polo brought some glazes back to Italy in the 13th century. Agricola, around 1600, reports the use of borax as a flux in metallurgy. In 1777, boric acid was recognized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> springs (soffioni) near Florence, Italy, and became known as sal sedativum, with primarily medical uses. The rare mineral is called sassolite, which is found at Sasso, Italy. Sasso was {{the main source of}} European borax from 1827 to 1872, when American sources replaced it. Boron compounds were relatively rarely used until the late 1800s when Francis Marion Smith's Pacific Coast Borax Company first popularized and produced them in volume at low cost.|$|E
40|$|Strongly {{enhanced}} and spatially confined near-fields <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{vicinity of}} plasmonic nanostructures open up exciting new capabilities for photon-driven processes and particularly also for optical spectroscopy. Surface enhanced Raman signatures of single molecules can {{provide us with}} important information about the optical near-field. We discuss one- and two-photon excited surface enhanced Raman scattering {{at the level of}} single molecules as a tool for probing the plasmonic near-field of silver nanoaggregates. The experiments reveal enhancement factors of local fields <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hottest</b> <b>hot</b> spots of <b>the</b> near-field and their dependence on the photon energy. Also, the number of <b>the</b> <b>hottest</b> spots and their approximate geometrical size are found. Near-field amplitudes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hottest</b> spots can be enhanced by three orders of magnitudes. Nanoaggregates of 100 nm dimensions provide one hot spot on this highest enhancement level where the enhancement is confined within less than 1 nm dimension. <b>The</b> near-field enhancement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hottest</b> spots increases with decreasing photon energy...|$|R

5|$|Broasting uses a {{pressure}} cooker {{to accelerate the}} process. The moisture inside the chicken becomes steam and increases the pressure in the cooker, lowering the cooking temperature needed. The steam also cooks the chicken through, but still allows the pieces to be moist and tender while maintaining a crisp coating. Fat is heated in {{a pressure}} cooker. Chicken pieces are prepared as described above and then placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> fat. The lid {{is placed on the}} pressure cooker, and the chicken pieces are thus fried under pressure.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, fuel {{flows through}} the main fuel valve into {{regenerative}} cooling systems for the nozzle and MCC, or through the chamber coolant valve. Fuel passing through the MCC cooling system then passes back through the LPFTP turbine before being routed either to the fuel tank pressurization system or to the hot gas manifold cooling system (from where it passes into the MCC). Fuel in the nozzle cooling and chamber coolant valve systems is then sent via pre-burners into the HPFTP turbine and HPOTP before being reunited again <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> gas manifold, from where it passes into the MCC injectors. Once in the injectors, the propellants are mixed and injected into the main combustion chamber where they are ignited. The burning propellant mixture is then ejected through the throat and bell of the engine's nozzle, the pressure of which creates the thrust.|$|E
5|$|Metal armour was {{of limited}} use <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot,</b> wet {{tropical}} climate. It was heavy {{and had to}} be constantly cleaned to prevent rusting; in direct sunlight, metal armour became unbearably hot. Conquistadores often went without metal armour, or only donned it immediately prior to battle. They were quick to adopt quilted cotton armour based upon that used by their native opponents, and commonly combined this {{with the use of a}} simple metal war hat. Shields were considered essential by both infantry and cavalry; generally this was a circular target shield, convex in form and fashioned from iron or wood. Rings secured it to the arm and hand.|$|E

5|$|Minnesota has a {{continental}} climate, with hot summers and cold winters. Minnesota's {{location in the}} Upper Midwest allows it to experience some of the widest variety of weather in the United States, {{with each of the}} four seasons having its own distinct characteristics. The areas near Lake Superior in the Minnesota Arrowhead region experience weather unique {{from the rest of the}} state. The moderating effect of Lake Superior keeps the surrounding area relatively cooler in the summer and relatively warmer in the winter, giving that region a smaller yearly temperature range. On the Köppen climate classification, much of the southern third of Minnesota—roughly from the Twin Cities region southward—falls <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> summer humid continental climate zone (Dfa), and the northern two-thirds of Minnesota falls in the warm summer great continental climate zone (Dfb).|$|E
5|$|Once in the engine, the {{propellants}} {{flow through}} low-pressure fuel and oxidizer turbopumps (LPFTP and LPOTP), {{and from there}} into high-pressure turbopumps (HPFTP and HPOTP). From these HPTPs the propellants take different routes through the engine. The oxidizer is split into four separate paths: to the oxidizer heat exchanger, which then splits into the oxidizer tank pressurization and pogo suppression systems; to the low pressure oxidizer turbopump (LPOTP); to the high pressure oxidizer preburner, from which it is split into the HPFTP turbine and HPOTP before being reunited <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> gas manifold and sent on to the main combustion chamber (MCC); or directly into the main combustion chamber (MCC) injectors.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish conquistadores {{were largely}} volunteers, {{receiving}} {{the spoils of}} victory instead of a salary; many were experienced soldiers who had already campaigned in Europe. The Spanish expeditions to Central America were launched from three different Spanish jurisdictions, resulting in rival conquests by mutually hostile Spanish captains.

Metal armour was impractical <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot,</b> humid climate of Central America and the Spanish were quick to adopt the quilted cotton armour of the natives. The conquistadors were supported by {{a large number of}} Indian auxiliaries drawn from previously encountered Mesoamerican groups.|$|E
