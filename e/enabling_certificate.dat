The use of a SEM in conjunction with a simple threshold variant of the RSA cryptosystem (mediated RSA) offers a number of practical advantages over current revocation techniques. Our approach simplifies validation of digital signatures and <b>enables</b> <b>certificate</b> revocation within legacy systems. It also provides immediate revocation of all security capabilities. This paper discusses both the architecture and implementation of our approach as well as performance and compatibility with the existing infrastructure.

The goal of GeoPKI is to <b>enable</b> secure <b>certificate</b> {{validation}} (without user interaction) for {{situations in}} which a user interacts with an online entity associated with the physical space where the the user trusts (and usually is currently located). GeoPKI enables {{the owner of a}} space to associate a certificate with that space, and <b>enables</b> space-based <b>certificate</b> lookup to set up a secure channel to the online resource associated with the space. Such a system enables several secure applications, such as secure authentication of paywall certificates at an airport or hotel.

40|$|Abstract. We {{address the}} issue of {{updating}} privileges in a dynamic environment by introducing authority cerrtificates in a Privilege Management Infrastructure. These certificates can be used to create access-level permissions but also to delegate authority to other agents, thereby providing a mechanism for creating management structures and for changing these structures over time. We present a semantic framework for privileges and certificates and an associated calculus, encoded as a logic program, for reasoning about them. The framework distinguishes between the time a certificate is issued or revoked and the time for which the associated privilege is created. This <b>enables</b> <b>certificates</b> to have prospective and retrospective effects, and allows us to reason about privileges and their consequences in the past, present, and future. The calculus provides a verification procedure for determining, given a set of declaration and revocation certificates, whether a certain privilege holds. ...|$|R

5000|$|The Treaty of Waitangi, in {{the second}} article, gave the Crown the pre-emptive right for all land {{purchases}} from Māori. This was the chief {{source of income for}} the Crown, and later the Provinces, as they would pass on the land to the settlers with a significant margin. But it also put some control over the way Māori were dealt with. The colony obtained much self-control from the Crown with the New Zealand Constitution Amendment Act, which was passed in 1857. This transferred much decision making from Britain to the colony, and without this change, the Native Land Acts of 1862 and 1865 would not have been possible. Those Acts abolished Crown pre-emption of land (thus nullifying the treaty's second article), and <b>enabled</b> <b>certificate</b> of title to be issued to individual Māori, with titles held by no more than ten individuals, but each individual had the sole power of selling the title. Settlers could then negotiate with individuals and as soon as {{one of them was a}} willing seller, transfer of title could happen. With that system in place, 95% of the North Island was able to be transferred to settlers or the Government by 1900. In historian Claudia Orange's assessment, the 1865 Act [...] "introduced revolutionary change".|$|R

40|$|We {{show how}} to greatly {{accelerate}} self-collision detection (SCD) for reduced deformable models. Given a triangle mesh {{and a set}} of deformation modes, our method precomputes Subspace Self-Collision Culling (SSCC) certificates which, if satisfied, prove the absence of self-collisions for large parts of the model. At runtime, bounding volume hierarchies augmented with our certificates can aggressively cull overlap tests and reduce hierarchy updates. Our method supports both discrete and continuous SCD, can handle complex geometry, and makes no assumptions about geometric smoothness or normal bounds. It is particularly effective for simulations with modest subspace deformations, where it can often verify the absence of self-collisions in constant time. Our <b>certificates</b> <b>enable</b> low amortized costs, in time and across many objects in multibody dynamics simulations. Finally, SSCC is effective enough to support self-collision tests at audio rates, which we demonstrate by producing the first sound simulations of clattering objects...|$|R
