5|$|The Abwehr {{was right}} {{to worry about the}} {{presence}} of British double agents within their secret service. They were at that time already running 'Garbo' (Juan Pujol), 'Zig-Zag' (Eddie Chapman) and 'Tricycle' (Dušan Popov), supposedly German agents to whom they were paying large sums of money, but who were in reality working for the British and were supplying the Germans with <b>false</b> <b>information.</b>|$|E

40|$|Eight- and 12 -year-old {{children}} {{were presented with}} neutral and negative emotional Deese-Roediger-McDermott lists equated on familiarity and associative strength. Both recall and recognition (A') measures were obtained. Recall measures exhibited the usual age increments in true and false recollection. True neutral items were better recalled and recognized than true negative emotional items. Although the children showed more false recall for neutral than for negative emotional lists, false recognition was higher for negative emotional than for neutral items. A' analyses also showed that whereas true neutral <b>information</b> and <b>false</b> neutral <b>information</b> were easily discriminated by children regardless of age, the same {{was not the case}} for true and <b>false</b> negative emotional <b>information.</b> Together, these results suggest that although children may be able to censor negative emotional information at recall, such information promotes relational processing in children's memory, making true and <b>false</b> emotional <b>information</b> less discriminable overall...|$|R
5|$|The {{investigation}} into the fire was led by the Division of Forestry's chief investigator, Sam Butcher. The investigation lasted four months, and once a suspect had been identified, the case {{was turned over to}} the Webster County prosecuting attorney's office. Butcher credited Art Yagel, a Division of Forestry investigator, for bringing the investigation to its conclusion. In January 2008, a 17-year-old suspect from Bergoo was formally charged with a felony count of arson for setting fire to the tree, while a second juvenile was also charged with a misdemeanor for providing <b>false</b> <b>information</b> to investigators. The suspect was also charged with misdemeanor counts of providing <b>false</b> <b>information</b> to conservation officers, possession of marijuana, and underage consumption of alcohol. The second juvenile was not involved in the setting of the fire.|$|E
5|$|U.S. {{officials}} said that the CIA conducted a review of intelligence supplied by al-Balawi, examining whether he supplied <b>false</b> <b>information</b> about U.S. successes amid valid data used to establish his credibility.

The National Counterterrorism Center conducted its own review of the intelligence al-Balawi provided, two {{officials said}}.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} the river, Robb divides his forces, sending the aforementioned 2,000 men to distract Lord Tywin's army. Due to the <b>false</b> <b>information</b> Robb {{gave to the}} captured Lannister scout, Lord Tywin's force believes it is the whole Stark army. The remainder of Robb's men sneak up on Jaime Lannister's army, defeating them and capturing Jaime. When captured, Jaime challenges Robb to a one-on-one duel to settle the matter, which Robb declines.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer ScienceCognitive radio (CR) {{technology}} {{has emerged as}} a promising solution to alleviate the spectrum scarcity problem. With the capability of sensing the frequency bands in a time and location-varying spectrum environment, CR technology allows an unlicensed user to exploit those frequency bands unused by licensed users in an opportunistic manner. Since different unlicensed users may acquire different channel availability information, they often need to exchange their channel information with each other for the realization of many networking protocols. However, if malicious unlicensed users exchange <b>false</b> channel <b>information</b> among other nodes, the networking protocols may fail, which leads to significant performance degradation. We name this type of attack as the <b>false</b> channel <b>information</b> exchange attack. In this thesis, a distributed algorithm is proposed to identify the malicious nodes and fight against the <b>false</b> channel <b>information</b> exchange attack in CR ad hoc networks. The spatial correlation of the channel information is used to analyze the authenticity of the received channel information. In addition, the temporal correlation of the channel availability is investigated to further enhance the performance. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm achieves very high detection rate to find out the malicious nodes, while the false alarm rate is relatively low. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first that investigates the <b>false</b> channel <b>information</b> exchange attacks in CR ad hoc networks...|$|R

50|$|<b>False</b> or {{incomplete}} <b>information</b> that {{is given}} on the asylum application and any following inaccuracies {{can lead to}} significant consequences for the asylum seeker, according to Section 30 AsylG. This especially concerns <b>false</b> identity <b>information</b> which can make procedures like weddings, childbirth or targeted naturalisation more difficult or even impossible until correct information can be clarified. Additionally, if these untrue personal details are also intentionally used apart from the application for asylum, criminal liability according to the Act on Residence (AufenthG) can come into consideration.|$|R
5|$|As all of Springfield {{rushes to}} send out their tax returns just before midnight on April 15, Homer realizes he did not file his. He rushes and {{provides}} <b>false</b> <b>information</b> before delivering it to the post office. The IRS discovers Homer's fraud and arrests him. To avoid prison, Homer agrees to help Agent Johnson of the FBI. With a hidden microphone under his shirt, Homer uncovers that his coworker Charlie is leading a group planning to assault all government officials, but is arrested by the FBI for conspiracy.|$|E
5|$|Then {{there is}} the {{deliberate}} citation of <b>false</b> <b>information</b> which is then ascribed legitimate authors. For instance, at a minimum, five of the History's sixteen citations of Dexippus {{are considered to be}} fake, and Dexippus appears to be mentioned, not as a principal source of information, but rather as a contradictory author to be contrasted against information sourced from Herodian or the Enmannsche Kaisergeschichte. In addition Quintus Gargilius Martialis, who produced works on horticulture and medicine, is cited twice as a biographer, which is considered to be another false attribution.|$|E
5|$|These were {{years of}} tension in policy towards France, with Walsingham sceptical of the {{unpredictable}} Henry III and distrustful of the English ambassador in Paris, Edward Stafford. Stafford, who was compromised by his gambling debts, {{was in the}} pay of the Spanish and passed vital information to Spain. Walsingham may {{have been aware of}} Stafford's duplicity, as he fed the ambassador <b>false</b> <b>information,</b> presumably in the hope of fooling or confusing the Spanish.|$|E

As a member of the then-unseen Syndicate, he {{was in a position to}} know a great deal of information. Deep Throat felt that the truth the Syndicate kept secret from the public needed to be known, and believed Mulder to be the one person capable of exposing this knowledge. However, during the disappearance of Max Fenig, Deep Throat provided Mulder with <b>false</b> <b>information</b> in order to divert him, later explaining that he believed the public was just not ready to know some truths.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to British {{activity in the}} region and the reluctance of the inhabitants of Île de France to follow orders from the National Convention abolishing slavery, the French dispatched a squadron of frigates to the East Indies early in 1796. This force, led by Contre-amiral Pierre César Charles de Sercey, originally comprised three frigates, subsequently joined by three more vessels, forming a powerful raiding squadron. After resupplying on Île de France in July, Sercey's frigates cruised off the Ceylon coast, dissuaded from attacking the undefended ports of British India by <b>false</b> <b>information</b> fed to his scouts that a British battle squadron was at anchor in Calcutta. Turning eastwards, Sercey hoped to raid George Town at Penang, but was driven off in an inconclusive engagement with a British squadron off Sumatra on 9 September. He spent the winter sheltering in Batavia on Java.|$|E
5|$|Most historians {{share the}} view that the militants {{escalated}} the conflict toward violence on the basis of <b>false</b> <b>information</b> transmitted by duplicitous individuals or groups attempting to neutralize the nationalist influence. Members of VVS and Jiny involved in the initial attacks have stated that their organizations were obliged to attack after the signal to take action was transmitted to them by a group that was later discovered to have secret ties to the national police. Researchers have documented reports of nationalists whose member organizations joined the conflict upon commands issued by the police, British nationals, and French settlers living in Madagascar. Despite the role of the militants in leading the uprising, the colonial authorities immediately held MDRM responsible for the movement and responded by targeting the party's members and supporters.|$|E

5|$|On the boat, Mulder and Smith {{debate whether}} they should save Mulder’s mother Teena, despite the risk of Men in Black {{awaiting}} them. Mulder ultimately agrees {{that it would be}} too dangerous to visit her. Instead, they head towards Canada, where Smith says Mulder will find his sister, Samantha. Meanwhile, the First Elder (Don S. Williams) meets with The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) in Teena's hospital room, confronting him with photos of his prior meeting with her, taken by X (Steven Williams). They realize that there is a leak, and plan to smoke out its source by releasing <b>false</b> <b>information</b> about Teena being in danger.|$|E
5|$|Sercey {{was unaware}} of how {{scattered}} British forces were in the region, and sent Alerte to scout ahead after the squadron arrived off Ceylon. Captain Drieu of Alerte made the miscalculation of attacking a ship on 14 August {{which turned out to}} be the 28-gun British dispatch frigate HMS Carysfort, and on board Alerte the British captors discovered documents revealing the exact extent of Sercey's strength and intentions. Carysforts captain was unable to warn any allied ships as his small frigate was the only British warship in the Bay of Bengal, and so he instead arranged for <b>false</b> <b>information</b> to be passed to Sercey regarding a fictional British battle squadron at Madras. This was sufficient to deter Sercey from lingering in the area, and after a raiding sweep along the coast to Tranquebar his squadron sailed eastwards once more.|$|E
5|$|The Maya at Chaktumal fed <b>false</b> <b>information</b> to the Spanish, and Montejo {{was unable}} to find d'Avila and link up with him. D'Avila {{returned}} overland to Xelha, and transferred the fledgling Spanish colony to nearby Xamanha, modern Playa del Carmen, which Montejo considered to be a better port. After waiting for d'Avila without result, Montejo sailed south as far as the Ulúa River in Honduras before turning around and heading back up the coast to finally meet up with his lieutenant at Xamanha. Late in 1528, Montejo left d'Avila to oversee Xamanha and sailed north to loop around the Yucatán Peninsula and head for the Spanish colony of New Spain in central Mexico.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Absence of trusted online {{transaction}} environment (TOTE) becomes {{the biggest obstacle}} to e-commerce development, which embodies three key problems: unauthentic identity <b>information,</b> <b>false</b> product <b>information</b> and insecure transaction process. In order to present a systematic method to build trusted {{online transaction}} environment with identity authentic information, accurate product information and secure transaction process, this article puts forward a framework composed of three information infrastructures: Identity Authentication Service (IAS), Product Information Service (PIS) and Electronic Contracts Service (ECS). They have been implemented in online pharmaceutical transaction field in China, and have facilitated all online transaction participants such as pharmaceutical manufactures, dealers, consumers, online market operators and government regulators...|$|R

5|$|On November 9, 2000, the WWF filed {{a lawsuit}} against the PTC in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, {{claiming}} that the PTC's statements were false and constituted defamation. The WWF also filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against the PTC for using clips from WWF programs in their promotional videos. The PTC filed for dismissal of the suit, but on May 24, 2001, U.S. district court Judge Denny Chin denied the PTC's motion on the basis that the WWF's lawsuit had merit. The PTC and the WWF settled out of court and, as part of the settlement agreement, the PTC paid the WWF $3.5 million USD and Bozell issued a public apology, stating that it was wrong to blame the World Wrestling Federation or any of its programs for the deaths of children and that the original statements had been based on what was later found to be <b>false</b> <b>information</b> designed by people close to the Lionel Tate case to blame the death of Tiffany Eunick on the WWF.|$|E
5|$|Sercey {{refitted}} his squadron at Île de France, dividing it {{into two}} forces. The largest, comprising Forte, Prudente, Seine, Régénérée, Vertu and Cybèle was to sail eastwards under his command. The second, comprising the recently arrived Preneuse and the corvette Brûle-Gueule was ordered westwards {{to operate in}} the Mozambique Channel. Sercey sailed on 14 July 1796, reaching Ceylon by 14 August. He was unaware at this stage that the ports of eastern India were undefended, Rainier's prolonged stay in the East Indies leaving no warships to protect Madras and Calcutta, and Sercey consequently sent the privateer Alerte to scout the Bay of Bengal. Alerte was subsequently captured by the British frigate , and documents detailing Sercey's strength found aboard. This information was used to surreptitiously supply Sercey with <b>false</b> <b>information</b> that a British battle squadron was at anchor in Madras. Dissuaded from further operations in the region, Sercey raided Tranquebar and then sailed for the East Indies.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, he had {{received}} worrying British intelligence reports that {{said he was in}} danger of being assassinated and his country may face a coup d'état. His tribesmen were unhappy at Habibullah's perceived subservience to the British, and his council and relatives openly spoke of their suspicions at his inactivity. Habibullah began purging his court of officials who were known to be close to Nasrullah and Amanullah. He recalled emissaries he had sent to Persia for talks with Germany and Turkey for military aid. Meanwhile, the war took {{a turn for the worse}} for the Central Powers. The Arab revolt against Turkey and the loss of Erzurum to the Russians ended the hopes of sending a Turkish division to Afghanistan. The German influence in Persia also declined rapidly, ending the hopes that Goltz Pasha could lead a Persian volunteer division into Afghanistan. The mission came to realise that the Emir deeply mistrusted them. A further attempt by British intelligence to feed <b>false</b> <b>information</b> to the mission, purportedly originating from Goltz Pasha, convinced von Hentig of the Emir's lack of trust. A last offer was made by Nasrullah in May 1916 to remove Habibullah from power and lead the frontier tribes in a campaign against British India. However, von Hentig knew it would come to nothing, and the Germans left Kabul on 21 May 1916. Niedermayer instructed Wagner to stay in Herat as a liaison officer. The Indian members also stayed, persisting in their attempts at an alliance.|$|E
