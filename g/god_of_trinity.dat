50|$|Christologically {{this part}} was {{considered}} offensive, inasmuch as Jesus Christ, who is <b>God's</b> Person <b>of</b> the <b>Trinity</b> in Christianity, {{can say that}} God had forsaken him. However, as in the Psalm abandonment by God is not the end. Rather, following in both cases is the sudden and abrupt rescue of the petitioner by God, in the New Testament Jesus' resurrection.

40|$|During History of Theology the Biblical {{teaching}} <b>of</b> <b>God’s</b> {{love has}} not always been connected with the Christian dogma <b>of</b> <b>God’s</b> <b>Trinity.</b> Regretably, God’s love has quite often been perceived as a quality within God, comprehended as a transcendent subject in some metaphysical-philosophical sense, independent of the Trinitarian dogma. Consequently, this dogma has been estimated as an unessential and peripheral part of Christian dogmatics. This article draws an intimate and undissolvable connection between God’s love and God’s Trinity. This connection is being drawn by a systematic-theological exposition of a central point in the theology of Wolfhart Pannenberg. As one of the leading theologians of our time he renews and unfolds the Biblical teaching that God is love just as, and only as, the Triune God...|$|R
50|$|All three {{hypostasis}} {{sharing a}} common essence or ousia or being, which {{is referred to}} as <b>God.</b> The ousia <b>of</b> <b>God</b> being completely unknowable or incomprehensible to mankind since it is uncreated where as nothingness as well as mankind are created (see Nikolai Berdyaev). The energies <b>of</b> <b>God</b> the Father having the same hyper-being in that they are without cause and or uncreated (see Gregory Palamas). God's energies as uncreated and indestructible.

Lossky points out that God's existences can be spoken of but not his being. If one then speaks <b>of</b> <b>God's</b> essence or being as anything outside of incomprehensible, one speaks in direct contradiction to the theoria of Christianity and as such are not true theologians and are instead speaking <b>of</b> <b>God</b> through speculations, rather than experience.|$|R
60|$|We are all so {{weary of}} this {{theology}} of the Christians, we are all at heart so sceptical about their Triune God, that it is needless here to spend any time or space upon the twenty thousand different formulae in which the orthodox have attempted to believe in something of the sort.

5000|$|Ynglists {{believe that}} all these ideas fit the {{original}} [...] "Russian spiritual culture" [...] which may rescue people from corruption.

The journal Zhiva-Astra issued by the Ynglist Church has published Gnostic scriptures that are popular among Russian nationalists, such as the Secret Gospel of John and the New Testament of the Holy Apostle Thomas discovered in 1945. Ynglists say that early Slavic volkhvs {{were aware of the}} concepts <b>of</b> a supreme <b>God</b> and <b>of</b> the <b>trinity,</b> which were later borrowed by Christian organisations.

He instigates his soldiers into rebellion and puts Vidyapati in prison. Selvambigai secretly goes to the prison and asks him sing in her praise so as to guarantee his freedom; Vidyapati rejects the offer and instead sings in a manner that insults her. Veeravallan learns of the meeting and puts Selvambigai in prison, orders the execution of both her and Vidyapati, and declares himself the kingdom's ruler. The <b>Gods</b> <b>of</b> the Holy <b>Trinity,</b> Shiva (Haranath), Vishnu (Sivakumar) and Brahma (Sarangkapani) settle the dispute by explaining the importance of knowledge, wealth, and strength combined, and how dangerous it is if each of them are bestowed on human beings separately. Finally, the three Goddesses reconcile and Vidyapati, Selvambigai and Veeravallan realise the importance of wealth, knowledge and strength.|$|R
