Before then, I'd been frustrated because I wanted to be more hands-on. I <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> TAC are doing it where it needs to happen. It really needed to be given support, and I thought that perhaps I might be well-placed to do it.|$|E
500|$|Dr. Dooom 2, Thornton's 2008 {{follow-up}} to First Come, First Served, {{was produced in}} response to The Return of Dr. Octagon. According to Thornton, [...] "I'm one of those artists that people take my music without my consent. People love to snatch my music and do things on their own. You got people that put me on beats I never rapped on. I <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> it's a bad thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Federer {{defeated}} Nadal in five compelling sets {{in three}} hours and forty-five minutes, for a fifth consecutive Wimbledon championship (equalling the feat achieved by Björn Borg). Borg himself returned to Wimbledon {{for the first time}} since losing the final in 1981, saying [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> this is the right time for me to come back, to hopefully watch Roger winning his fifth title in a row to match my record." [...] This match marked only the third time in the new century that a Major final had gone to five sets, and was the first time the technology Hawk-Eye was ever used in a Wimbledon final.|$|E

500|$|Several of {{the songs}} on the album drew their lyrics from real life relationships. [...] "Peachy" [...] {{documents}} the permanent breakup of a relationship that had inspired her 2004 single [...] "Ten Days". [...] "Where I Stood", which Higgins calls [...] "a pretty sad love song", describes the end of another relationship. She said it portrays [...] "one of those situations where you <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> leaving this person is {{something you have to}} do to get to know yourself again." [...] "Secret" [...] was about an ex-girlfriend who was uncomfortable about going public with their relationship; [...] "I was so head over heels in love with her I kind of wanted to shout it out to the world, so it was just a song about keeping something under the covers ... keeping it away locked in a little room." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. The A.V. Club writer Myles McNutt compared the episode to [...] "Training Day" [...] commenting that The Inner Circle' is {{more successful than}} that episode [...] on some levels", but [...] "both episodes suffer from the same problem: They’re simply not very funny or meaningful, which I'd argue is even more problematic for [...] "The Inner Circle" [...] given {{its position in the}} season." [...] He ultimately gave the episode a C-. TV Squad writer Joel Keller wrote that while [...] "the episode did have its funny moments", [...] "overall, you can <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> the show has changed in a very fundamental way". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix criticized the writers for still not finding Deangelo's character out commenting that [...] "the fact that the writers so clearly {{had no idea what to}} do with Ferrell doesn't fill me with confidence for whatever guest stars turn up in the final episodes – nor do I feel especially great right now about the idea of an outside character coming in as the permanent new regional manager." ...|$|E
500|$|That {{night at}} the Marott Hotel, Kennedy hosted a meeting with 14 local black leaders. The meeting had been {{arranged}} before the assassination by aide James Tolan and took place in Tolan's room. The group had debated among themselves {{as to whether they}} should hold the meeting. Kennedy eventually arrived, and the conversation quickly became heated as leaders accused him of being an unreliable member of [...] "the white establishment." [...] He lost his temper, saying, [...] "I don't need all this aggravation. I could sit next to my swimming pool. You know, God's been good to me and I really don't need anything. But I <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> if He's been that good, I should try to put something back in. And you all call yourselves leaders and you've been moaning and groaning about personal problems. You haven't once talked about your own people." [...] The meeting ended with most attendees pledging their support to Kennedy's campaign. One of them later acknowledged that Kennedy was [...] "completely sympathetic and understanding".|$|E
5000|$|After a short {{trial with}} Hereford United, Bowman signed for the Conference Premier club on 24 July 2012 on a one-year contract. Manager Martin Foyle commented <b>that</b> [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that's</b> {{the type of}} player I'll have. Someone who is keen, hungry and who feels they have got a point to prove." [...] Bowman made a scoring debut with Hereford's last goal in the 89th minute of a 4-2 win at home to Ebbsfleet United on 25 August 2012. He scored two goals in Hereford's 3-1 home victory over League One team Shrewsbury Town in the FA Cup first round on 3 November 2012. He {{finished}} 2012-13 as Hereford's top scorer with 19 goals from 43 appearances.|$|R

500|$|Pre-Madonna {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Mark Egan from Rocky Mountain News writes that [...] "although the songs have soul in them, it's the delivery that lacks in Madonna's voice; you <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> something is really missing." [...] Mark Zug from Chicago Tribune commented that [...] "the demos on Pre-Madonna are {{a delight to}} listen to. To all the Madonna fans, this is one album worth collecting and replaying." [...] Jasmine Temple from Lexington Herald-Leader calls the album, [...] "a gloriously voyeuristic—and unauthorized—glimpse at Madonna's past, the woman she was then. You can actually sense {{the development of the}} icon she is today from the songs." [...] Robin DeRosa from USA Today was disappointed with the release, saying that [...] "it feels forced. This release is as unneeded as the hoopla surrounding Madonna's new born. Every artist has demo recordings in their early phases of career and they are generally not good. This one is not different." [...] After Madonna was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008, Tony Sclafani from MSNBC noted that none of Madonna's songs were in the rock music genre, [...] "but all use rock as a jumping off point. Audible evidence of Madonna's rock roots {{can be found on the}} collection of early demos Pre-Madonna." ...|$|E
500|$|In the Court of Appeals seat, Sotomayor {{gained a}} {{reputation}} for vigorous and blunt behavior toward lawyers appealing before her, sometimes {{to the point of}} brusque and curt treatment or testy interruptions. [...] She was known for extensive preparation for oral arguments and for running a [...] "hot bench", where judges ask lawyers plenty of questions. Unprepared lawyers suffered the consequences, but the vigorous questioning was an aid to lawyers seeking to tailor their arguments to the judge's concerns. The 2009 Almanac of the Federal Judiciary, which collected anonymous evaluations of judges by lawyers who appear before them, contained a wide range of reactions to Sotomayor. Comments also diverged among lawyers willing to be named. Attorney Sheema Chaudhry said, [...] "She's brilliant and she's qualified, but I <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> she can be very, how do you say, temperamental." [...] Defense lawyer Gerald B. Lefcourt said, [...] "She used her questioning to make a point, as opposed to really looking for an answer to a question she did not understand." [...] In contrast, Second Circuit Judge Richard C. Wesley said that his interactions with Sotomayor had been [...] "totally antithetical to this perception that has gotten some traction that she is somehow confrontational." [...] Second Circuit Judge and former teacher Guido Calabresi said his tracking showed that Sotomayor's questioning patterns were no different from those of other members of the court and added, [...] "Some lawyers just don’t like to be questioned by a woman. [...] was sexist, plain and simple." ...|$|E

2500|$|Khan has a {{reputation}} for avoiding award ceremonies and not accepting any popular Indian film awards. Though nominated many times, Khan has not attended any Indian film award ceremonies and has stated that [...] "Indian film awards lack credibility". When asked about the selection procedure and authenticity of popular Indian film awards, Aamir Khan said, [...] "Fact is that I have no objections to film awards per se. I <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> if I don't value a particular film award, then I won't attend it either. Apart from the National Film Awards, I don't see any other award ceremony that I should give value to. My personal experience about these award ceremonies is that I don't trust them. I have no faith in them so I would prefer to stay away." ...|$|E
2500|$|Henry {{remained}} a first-team regular during the 2011–12 season, {{playing in the}} club's first ever League One match, a 0–0 draw with Exeter City. He went on to make 40 appearances during the campaign, with the Stevenage defence being particularly strong once again. However, he suffered an injury following the club's 1–1 home draw against Preston North End on 9 April 2012. The game ultimately {{turned out to be}} Henry's last match for the club. After spending seven years at Stevenage, Henry left the club when his contract expired in May 2012. On leaving Stevenage, he stated — [...] "I have had an absolutely unbelievable time with the club and I couldn't have wished to have spent seven years anywhere else. I <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> now is my time to move on". He made a total of 329 appearances during his seven-year tenure.|$|E

2500|$|He {{contends that}} the United States went to war [...] "with no justification." [...] On the subject, he said, [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> the reason of going in {{for weapons of mass}} destruction, the ability of the Iraqis to make a nuclear weapon, that's all been proven that it was never there." [...] He added that his change of opinion came about from {{attending}} the funeral of a sergeant killed in Iraq, when his last letter to his family was being read out. On June 16, 2005, he joined with three other members of Congress (Neil Abercrombie, Dennis Kucinich and Ron Paul) in introducing a resolution calling for the start of a withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq to begin by October 2006. Jones covered the hallway outside his office with photographs of soldiers who had died in Iraq. He said, [...] "If we were given misinformation intentionally by people in this administration, to commit the authority to send boys, and in some instances girls, to go into Iraq, that is wrong. Congress must be told the truth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dev's electro {{style and}} [...] "sing-talk" [...] vocal style have been {{compared}} to fellow pop singer Kesha. Dev responded to this, saying, [...] "I'm confident enough in what I do that people will see me for who I am ... I get why people compare us but once people see me live they won't connect us as much." [...] While comparing her to Kesha, Idolator wrote that [...] "Dev's beats come off a bit more mellow and her songs {{a little bit more}} electro than pop." [...] In response to being compared to both Kesha and Uffie, Dev said, [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> I have a lot more to say and the ability to have an eclectic sound, I'm not bashing either artist, but I'm {{going to be able to}} give you a little bit more than what you've heard on those records. When my album comes out, hopefully I won't have to hear another reference or comparison." [...] Much of Dev's music is inspired by rap music, as she believes that fans respond to [...] "pop music but with rap roots". She said, [...] "I've always been into hip-hop. Eminem changed my life when I was younger." [...] The Hollywood Reporter compared her [...] "futuristic" [...] and [...] "pulsing" [...] sound to underground electroclash musicians Peaches and Yelle. Dev's musical genres have been cited as electro-crunk and electropop.|$|E
2500|$|Publicist Marvet Britto stated, [...] "Jackson embodies grace, {{style and}} integrity...She {{has never been}} known as a bad person." [...] Britto {{describes}} Jackson’s videotaped apology as [...] "impersonal", saying, [...] "She has never been an impersonal artist, so it made it seem like she was guilty of something, and she wasn't. I would have had her and Timberlake apologizing side by side right from the beginning, since they performed side by side. Otherwise, it made the whole apology seem calculated and contrived." [...] Jackson said of the apology, [...] "I probably {{should have done it}} live. But there was so much going on at the time that I needed to just get it done. It is what it is. And it will pass, and I'm fine with it." [...] At one point Jackson was scheduled to be interviewed about the incident by Diane Sawyer on the ABC newsmagazine Primetime, however, the interview never came to fruition. Jackson later briefly discussed the incident on Good Morning America and the Late Show with David Letterman. Jackson's outfit was designed by famed designer Alexander McQueen, with Jackson later commenting [...] "I don't blame him; he didn't rip it. Alexander is so great at what he does – he's a genius." [...] In an interview with Australia's Herald Sun, Jackson commented on Timberlake (whom, as mentioned, Jackson had previously known personally and aided when she selected his former group 'N Sync to open for her Velvet Rope World Tour at the start of their career) distancing himself from the incident and seemingly changing with fame. [...] "I really want to be honest about this, but I <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> anything I say about him will be taken the wrong way", said Jackson. [...] "I do think that Justin is very talented and that he has a very big career ahead of him. But he seems to have changed recently. He's gotten a bit cocky. You know, some people can handle success and some people can't. I'm starting to wonder if (the latter) is the case with Justin. And it hurts me to say that." [...] Producer Jimmy Jam revealed Jackson considered writing a song about the incident for her Damita Jo album, saying, [...] "I don't know whether it will or not. But I have a feeling it probably will, because kind of whatever's happening in her life tends to be what she writes about [...] It'd be kind of interesting to see what her feeling is about it." ...|$|E

60|$|Here the {{judgment}} goes altogether against the choice. The girl grows up before us from her early youth till her twenty-fifth or twenty-sixth year, and becomes,--such {{as her mother}} described her,--one whose headlong will, whose jealousy, and whose vanity nothing could restrain. She has none of those soft foibles, half allied to virtues, by which weak women fall away into misery or perhaps distraction. She {{does not want to}} love or to be loved. She does not care to be fondled. She has no longing for caresses. She wants to be admired,--and {{to make use of the}} admiration she shall achieve for the material purposes of her life. She wishes to rise in the world; and her beauty is the sword with which she must open her oyster. As to her heart, it is a thing of which she becomes aware, only to assure herself that it must be laid aside and put out of the question. Now and again Esmond touches it. She <b>just</b> <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> she has a heart to be touched. But she never has a doubt as to her conduct in that respect.
