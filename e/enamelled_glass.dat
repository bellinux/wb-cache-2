30|$|Collecting, studying, and copying Islamic {{art from}} earlier centuries became popular in Europe {{during the late}} 19 th century. Known to Europeans {{since the time of}} their {{production}} via extensive trade between the Mamluks and the Venetians, these 13 th– 14 th-century Mamluk mosque lamps were of particular interest to 19 th-century collectors due to their “exotic” and luxurious appearance [2]. Major collections of gilded and <b>enameled</b> <b>glass</b> were formed in the 19 th century; however, these collections were often beset by confusion or misattribution of the individual pieces therein [3]. In particular, French glassmaker Philippe-Joseph Brocard (1831 – 1896), inspired by <b>enameled</b> <b>glass</b> mosque lamps from the Mamluk period, collected such lamps and was especially gifted at creating successful facsimiles of Islamic <b>enameled</b> <b>glass</b> [4]. Many of Brocard’s lamps survive in museum collections. Besides crafting unique artworks in the style of Islamic <b>enameled</b> <b>glass,</b> Brocard is also known to have restored enamels on genuine medieval examples [5]. It is not surprising, then, that such 19 th-century creations could be mistaken for medieval Islamic objects, and vice versa, without detailed technical and material analysis.|$|R

50|$|Designs {{were either}} painted {{freehand}} {{or over the}} top of outline incisions, and the technique probably originated in metalworking. Once painted, <b>enamelled</b> <b>glass</b> vessels needed to be fired at a temperature high enough to melt the applied powder, but low enough that the vessel itself was not melted.|$|E

5000|$|Murano {{glass is}} glass {{made on the}} [...] island of Murano, which has {{specialized}} in fancy glasswares for centuries.

5000|$|The term [...] "enamel" [...] is {{most often}} {{restricted}} to work on metal, which {{is the subject of}} this article. <b>Enamelled</b> <b>glass</b> is also called [...] "painted", and overglaze decoration to pottery is often called enamelling. The word enamel comes from the Old High German word smelzan (to smelt) via the Old French esmail, or from a Latin word smaltum, first found in a 9th-century life of Leo IV. Used as a noun, [...] "an enamel" [...] is usually a small decorative object coated with enamel.|$|E
50|$|Gilding {{during this}} period {{involved}} applying small amounts of gold in suspension onto a glass body, followed by a low firing to fuse the two materials, and was adopted from Byzantine traditions. This technique was often combined with enamelling, the application of ground glass with a colourant, to traditional and new vessel forms, and represents the height of Islamic glassmaking. Enamelling, a resurrection of older techniques, was first practiced in the Islamic world at Raqqa (Syria) during the late 12th century, but also spread to Cairo during Mamluk rule. A study of various enamelled vessels, including beakers and mosque lamps, {{suggests that there are}} two subtle yet distinct firing practices, possibly representing two distinct production centres or glass-working traditions. Due to its high demand, <b>enamelled</b> <b>glass</b> was exported throughout the Islamic world, Europe, and China {{during this period}}. Enamelling eventually ended in Syria and Egypt following disruption by various Mongol invasions from the 13th through to the 15th centuries AD.|$|E

5000|$|Lustre painting, by {{techniques}} {{similar to}} lustreware in pottery, {{dates back to}} the 8th century in Egypt, and became widespread in the 12th century. Another technique was decoration with threads of glass of a different colour, worked into the main surface, and sometimes manipulated by combing and other effects. Gilded, painted and <b>enamelled</b> <b>glass</b> were added to the repertoire, and shapes and motifs borrowed from other media, such as pottery and metalwork. Some of the finest work was in mosque lamps donated by a ruler or wealthy man. As decoration grew more elaborate, the quality of the basic glass decreased, and it [...] "often has a brownish-yellow tinge, and is rarely free from bubbles". [...] Aleppo seems to have ceased to be a major centre after the Mongol invasion of 1260, and Timur appears to have ended the Syrian industry about 1400 by carrying off the skilled workers to Samarkand. By about 1500 the Venetians were receiving large orders for mosque lamps.|$|E

40|$|The {{founding}} of lapis lazuli to give blue colour to glass and glazes {{is more and}} more coming out from the most recent studies of pottery and glassware of different epochs and provenances. The recent discovery in the south of Italy (Frederick II, Melfi castle) of <b>enamelled</b> <b>glass</b> pieces including blue enamels questioned the real nature of the blue colour raw materials because the castle is built over and not far from outcrops of two volcanic rocks – haüynophire and phonolite – that contain haüyne, mineral belonging to sodalite group as lazurite, that can be blue or become blue after heating. Raman microscopy and scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy were tested in order to identify the rock used as raw material and to understand if the chromophore-bearing mineral in the artefacts could be other than lazurite. To do this, the two volcanic rocks, lapis lazuli and archaeological glass with blue enamels, were studied. In particular, temperature-dependent Raman measurements and Raman mappings both on single lazurite and haüyne crystals and on the rocks and the enamels were carried out also in order to investigate the colouration mechanism of haüyne. The results obtained allowed to make hypotheses about the transformations occurring in haüyne with heating and about the procedures of distinguishing the raw materials...|$|E

40|$|Bird-Jones was {{selected}} through a public art competition organised {{and funded by}} Cywaith Cymru Artworks Wales. Documentation travelled to Blaenau Festioniog Library Arts Centre in 2004 and Bangor Museum in 2006. A large (30 ’x 12 ’) window in Bethania Chapel, Bethesda, North Wales, commissioned {{in memory of the}} 1900 - 1903 Slate Quarrymen’s Strike in Bethesda. The final window design was based upon ideas and images that address the village’s essential relationship to the landscape and its slate bedrock. Central feature of the work was a window within the window, placed upon a slate stone windowsill. The piece is constructed of three layers of antique glass, <b>enamelled</b> <b>glass</b> and blown glass. For this project, Bird-Jones researched the artistic translation of collective social memory. She conducted a significant collaborative inquiry with community members and school groups during her residency to understand local memory and contemporary narrative, as a basis for developing artistic and technical plans for the window. Extensive social, historical and visual research was conducted. Discovery of visual as well as social remnants of the strike directly influenced the design of the window. Images in texts etched into slate, in homes, the public space and in the landscape, and the particular weather and light qualities of the nearby mountains informed the transparency and opacity of the window design. Experience of the enduring social split following the strike led the design’s conceptual content, the inscriptions of 1000 villagers on the window, a process symbolically bringing together families split for a century. Bird-Jones worked with 3 German fabrication studios running experiments with technique, materials and processes before developing sample panels for the window...|$|E
40|$|The Republic of Venice’s ephemeral civic festivals celebrated {{and built}} on the {{reputation}} of its unique maritime location and urban setting, and its exceptional tolerance of marginalized minorities, such as Greeks, Muslims, Jews, Protestants or unmarried women. Europe’s gateway port for pilgrimages to Jerusalem and trade with the Ottoman Empire, Venice was also a destination worth boasting about in its own right, The Venetians developed their winter carnival {{along the lines of}} a grand court festival without the court. Their lavish sponsorship of spectacle, and use of masked costumes freeing participants from constraints of identity, gender and status, elevated it to a fashionable ephemeral highpoint accessible to anyone with wealth. What its own quack street pedlars pioneered in miniature, by employing performers to attract custom, Venice, city of merchants, perfected on the grandest possible scale, using its carnival to encourage, support and supply a vastly expanded market for portable visual souvenirs. By the eighteenth century, when the Grand Tour was a routine rite of passage for the European and British nobility, the Venetian carnival was firmly enshrined with other celebrated Italian tourist experiences, in magnificent illustrated guides such as Giambattista Albrizzi’s ‘Forestiero illuminato’. Even before that, the Venetian carnival’s immense opportunities were recognized by German-speaking art patrons such as Duke Anton Ulrich, who built up his celebrated Braunschweig collection of Venetian paintings during repeated visits to Venetian carnivals of the 1680 s. The renowned curiosity cabinet of Archduke Ferdinand II of Tyrol (1529 – 95), at his summer residence, Castle Ambras near Innsbruck, contributed substantially to Vienna’s Kunsthistorisches Museum. With particular reference to the Ambras collection, and to the travel journal of Ferdinand II’s nephew Prince Ferdinand of Bavaria recording their visit to the 1579 Venetian carnival, the focus here is on carnival-inspired visual souvenirs in the decades around 1600. Numerous early modern texts and pictures document German experiences of the Republic’s carnival, whether by Italian, German or Northern artists, brought back by German-speaking patrons from the Veneto, or commissioned on their return. Determining the provenance of my first two categories, large-scale paintings and <b>enamelled</b> <b>glass,</b> is often challenging. A third category, mostly commissioned in Germany, includes wall and ceiling paintings, jewels, automata and court festival costumes. Fourthly, the Venetian carnival generated a huge range of cheap print and ephemeral art in both Italy and Germany. Notably, formulaic printed and painted series of Venetian costumes and customs were produced for binding into the pocket-sized friendship albums (alba amicorum) which so many Nordic, Baltic and German-speakers (and even the odd Frenchman or Scot), took on their travels, and circulated widely on their return. ...|$|E
