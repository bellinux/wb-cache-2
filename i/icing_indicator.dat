Developmentsof sea surface temperature and sea ice in the past providecrucial information on paleoceanographic variability. The aim of this thesis is to establish a diatom-based transfer function for sea surface temperature and to reconstruct the Late Pleistocenepaleoceanographic history based on diatom assemblages, in order to improve theunderstanding of the North Pacific’s role in the global glacial-interglacial climatechanges. The thesis consists of three studies, of which the results are presented in three manuscripts.

40|$|In {{order to}} map the modern {{distribution}} of diatoms and to establish a reliable reference data set for paleoenvironmental reconstruction in the northern North Pacific, a new data set including the relative abundance of diatom species preserved {{in a total of}} 422 surface sediments was generated, which covers a broad range of environmental variables characteristic of the subarctic North Pacific, the Sea of Okhotsk and the Bering Sea between 30 ° and 70 °N. The biogeographic distribution patterns as well as the preferences in sea surface temperature of 38 diatom species and species groups are documented. A Q-mode factor analysis yields a three-factor model representing assemblages associated with the Arctic, Subarctic and Subtropical water mass, indicating a close relationship between the diatom composition and the sea surface temperatures. The relative abundance pattern of 38 diatom species and species groups was statistically compared with nine environmental variables, i. e. the summer sea surface temperature and salinity, annual surface nutrient concentration (nitrate, phosphate, silicate), summer and winter mixed layer depth and summer and winter sea ice concentrations. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) and other analyses indicate 32 species and species groups have strong correspondence with the pattern of summer sea surface temperature. In addition, the total diatom flux data compiled from ten sediment traps reveal that the seasonal signals preserved in the surface sediments are mostly from spring through autumn. This close relationship between diatom composition and the summer sea surface temperature will be useful in deriving a transfer function in the subarctic North Pacific for the quantitative paleoceanographic and paleoenvironmental studies.

40|$|Sea ice {{plays an}} {{important}} role in Earth's climate system. The lack of direct indications of past sea ice coverage, however, means that there is limited knowledge of the sensitivity and rate at which sea ice dynamics are involved in amplifying climate changes. As such, there is a need to develop new proxy records for reconstructing past sea ice conditions. Here we review the advances that have been made in using chemical tracers preserved in ice cores to determine past changes in sea ice cover around Antarctica. Ice core records of sea salt concentration show promise for revealing patterns of sea ice extent particularly over glacial–interglacial time scales. In the coldest climates, however, the sea salt signal appears to lose sensitivity and further work is required to determine how this proxy can be developed into a quantitative sea <b>ice</b> <b>indicator.</b> Methane sulphonic acid (MSA) in near-coastal ice cores has been used to reconstruct quantified changes and interannual variability in sea ice extent over shorter time scales spanning the last ∼ 160 years, and has potential to be extended to produce records of Antarctic sea ice changes throughout the Holocene. However the MSA ice core proxy also requires careful site assessment and interpretation alongside other palaeoclimate indicators to ensure reconstructions are not biased by non-sea ice factors, and we summarise some recommended strategies for the further development of sea ice histories from ice core MSA. For both proxies the limited information about the production and transfer of chemical markers from the sea ice zone to the Antarctic ice sheets remains an issue that requires further multidisciplinary study. Despite some exploratory and statistical work, the application of either proxy as an <b>indicator</b> of sea <b>ice</b> change in the Arctic also remains largely unknown. As information about these new ice core proxies builds, so too does the potential to develop a more comprehensive understanding of past changes in sea ice and its role in both long and short-term climate changes...|$|R
40|$|A late Pliocene – early Pleistocene, 2. 9 – 2. 0 Ma, diatom {{record from}} the Antarctic Geological Drilling Program (ANDRILL) MIS drillcore AND- 1 B is presented. This core, {{recovered}} {{from beneath the}} Ross Ice Shelf south of Ross Island, comprises multiple diatomaceous-sediment units deposited during interglacial periods with open water over the core site. These represent interglacial phases of orbitally paced climate cycles and are punctuated by glacial advances. Extant diatom assemblages have limited presence in the late Pliocene record, which makes environmental interpretation less straight forward. We employ modern ecological data in combination with late Pliocene to present variation in diatom assemblages across the Southern Ocean oceanic fronts based on DSDP/ ODP diatom biostratigraphic data to evaluate paleoenvironmental change for the 2. 9 – 2. 0 Ma interval of the AND- 1 B core. The diatom assemblages from AND- 1 B record a progressive environmental change through the late Pliocene–early Pleistocene. A relatively warm period with potential SST of up to 4 °C at ca. 2. 9 Ma was succeeded by a reduction of warm water species and an increase of taxa associated with more southerly water masses until 2. 58 Ma (at isotope stage G 1). Younger, early Pleistocene, diatomaceous units are dominated by extinct Rouxia, Thalassiosira species and newly described Fragilariopsis species indicative of cold open water and drift ice. The last recorded cooling step occurs {{at the top of}} the interval studied (ca 2. 0) Ma indicated by the trace abundance of Fragilariopsis and Actinocyclus species present in modern sea ice assemblages but absent in the late Pliocene–early Pleistocene AND- 1 B record, even though many of its species had their first occurrences during the Pliocene. The extant sea ice assemblage occurs with an abundance of 2 – 29 % (average 10 %) in the late Pliocene–early Pleistocene AND- 1 B record implying that the modern sea ice and ice shelf polar conditions were not established within the studied interval. The most frequently applied sea <b>ice</b> <b>indicator,</b> Fragilariopsis curta, is consistently present in low to moderate abundance (1 – 22 %) together with Chaetoceros resting spores (2 – 30 %) through the 2. 9 – 2. 0 Ma interval.

40|$|Arctic sea ice {{and river}} run-off {{contribute}} to the Transpolar Drift System of the Arctic Ocean and affect substantially Arctic and global climate. Given the recent environmental changes in the Arctic with drastic sea ice reductions and strongly increasing river run-off, paleoenvironmental investigations are essential to assume prospective impacts resulting from the current global warming. The ideal region to observe paleo-sea ice cover and river run-off within the Arctic are the Siberian marginal seas where enormous amounts of freshwater are drained onto the shelves and sea ice is produced. Therefore, the overall aim of this thesis is to examine how sea ice cover, river run-off and biological production (influenced by both parameters) varied on the Siberian shelves and if they might have affected the Transpolar Drift System during the Deglacial to Holocene. To achieve these objectives molecular biomarkers (sea ice biomarker IP 25; the phytoplankton biomarker-IP 25 (PIP 25 index); the HBI-diene (highly-branched isoprenoids); brassicasterol and dinosterol as indicators for marine organic matter; campesterol and β -sitosterol as indicators for terrigenous organic matter), were analyzed on five well-dated, continuous sediment cores from the Laptev Sea (Core PS 51 / 154 - 11, Core PS 51 / 159 - 10) and Kara Sea (Core BP 99 - 04 / 7, Core BP 00 - 07 / 7, Core BP 00 - 36 / 4) shelves. These biomarker records revealed high-resolution sea ice, river run-off and biological production variability over the last 17 and 12 ka, respectively. During the Deglacial, when the sea level was low, a significantly different environment compared to the modern prevailed on the Laptev Sea shelf. The upper continental slope was mostly covered with permanent sea ice (probably landfast ice) between 17. 2 and 16 ka. In addition, river run-off and biological production were extremely restricted. In {{the course of the}} Holocene transgression the proportion of the organic carbon sources changed on the Laptev Sea shelf reflected by a long-term decrease of terrigenous (riverine) organic matter and a synchronous increase of marine organic matter from 16 ka until 7. 5 ka. This evolution demonstrates the gradual establishment of fully marine conditions on the shelves, caused by the post-glacial transgression. In addition, strong environmental alterations during colder and warmer phases could be observed on the shelf during the post-glacial period. Cold phases with increased sea ice cover as well as decreased biological production and diminished river run-off occurred between 17. 2 and 16 ka (Deglacial), 15. 2 and 11 ka (including the Younger Dryas (12. 9 - 11. 6 ka) with maximum sea ice cover) as well as during the last 7 ka (late Holocene). Reduced sea ice cover as well as enhanced river run-off and more biological production could be observed between 15. 2 and 12. 9 ka (including the Bølling/Allerød warm period) and between 10 and 8 ka (the Holocene Thermal Maximum with minimum sea ice cover) indicative for warmer phases. Between 15. 2 and 12. 9 ka, the intensive warmer conditions are accompanied by prominent peaks of the DIP 25 index (ratio of the HBI-diene and IP 25). The late Holocene shows a distinct cooling trend but is further characterized by a conspicuous short-term variability of the sea <b>ice</b> <b>indicators.</b> In the central Kara Sea (Core BP 00 - 36 / 4) maximum sea ice cover could be recorded between 12. 4 and 11. 8 ka coinciding with the Younger Dryas cold reversal. Afterwards, a climatic amelioration is documented by minimum sea ice conditions between 10 and 8 ka (Holocene Thermal Maximum). The sea ice records of Core BP 00 - 07 / 7 from the southern Kara Sea reflect predominantly changes in the fast ice - polynya constellation. During the late Holocene expanding fast ice could be observed documenting the cooling trend. Additionally, conspicuous (multi-) centennial sea ice variations are notable during the last 6. 5 ka, consistent with global paleo-climate reconstructions. A cyclic variability of the sea <b>ice</b> <b>indicators</b> (400 -, 950 -year and 1500 -year cycles) was discovered, but a relation to Arctic Oscillation changes, proposed by various studies, could not be constantly identified in these records. The southernmost core from the Yenisei Estuary (Core BP 99 - 04 / 7) recorded consistently seasonal sea ice cover since 9. 3 ka, apart from five short phases of permanent sea ice cover at 7. 3, 4. 8, 4. 4, 3. 3 and 2 ka, documenting most likely fast ice expansion to the core site. The strong influence of river run-off as well as estuary processes might prevent the detection of (short-term) climatic signals at this study site. These studies revealed substantial environmental variations on the shelf, especially {{in the course of the}} Holocene transgression. Moreover, the environment seems to be more sensible when the shelves were flooded, since a conspicuous short-term sea ice variability appeared in both study areas during the last 7 ka. These considerable alterations on the shelf as well as the short-term variability probably impacted the Transpolar Drift and further Arctic and global climate...|$|R

40|$|Although {{analysis}} of clast macrofabrics {{have been used}} to differentiate between different types of glacial diamictons and to determine palaeo ice-flow directions, no account appears to have been made of preferred clast orientations inherited from the parental source material. Clast macrofabrics in tills are typically interpreted as having developed in response to an imposed subglacial deformation and as such provide a link between the sedimentary record and glacier dynamics. They rely on the assumption that any preferred clast orientation is a result of deformation/flow. The results of the micromorphological study of the Langholm Till exposed at North Corbelly near Dumfries (SW Scotland) clearly demonstrates that bedrock structure can influence clast orientation (macrofabric) within diamictons. In {{the lower part of the}} till, the orientation of elongate clasts preserves the geometry of the tectonic cleavage present within the underlying bedrock. The intensity of this steeply inclined, ‘inherited’ clast fabric decreases upward through the till, to be replaced by a more complex pattern of successive generations of clast microfabrics developed in response to deformation/flow. These results indicate potential limitations of applying clast macrofabric or microfabric analysis in isolation to establish till genesis or palaeo-ice flow directions. Consequently, due account should be made of other glacial palaeoenvironmental and <b>ice</b> flow <b>indicators,</b> as well as rockhead depth and morphology in relation to the selection of fabric measurements sites...|$|R

This area is significant because it linked {{the interior of the}} LIS to the Arctic Ocean, probably via a number of ice streams. Victoria Island, however, exhibits a remarkably complex glacial landscape, with several successive generations of <b>ice</b> flow <b>indicators</b> superimposed {{on top of each other}} and often at abrupt (90 °) angles. This complexity represents a major challenge to those attempting to produce a detailed reconstruction of the glacial history of the region. This paper presents a map of the glacial geomorphology of Victoria Island. The map is based on analysis of Landsat Enhanced Thematic Plus (ETM+) satellite imagery and contains over 58, 000 individual glacial features which include: glacial lineations, moraines (terminal, lateral, subglacial shear margin), hummocky moraine, ribbed moraine, eskers, glaciofluvial deposits, large meltwater channels, and raised shorelines. The glacial features reveal marked changes in ice flow direction and vigour over time. Moreover, the glacial geomorphology indicates a non-steady withdrawal of ice during deglaciation, with rapidly flowing ice streams focussed into the inter-island troughs and several successively younger flow patterns superimposed on older ones. It is hoped that detailed analysis of this map will lead to an improved reconstruction of the glacial history of this area which will provide other important insights, for example, with respect to the interactions between ice streaming, deglaciation and Arctic Ocean meltwater events...|$|R

40|$|Aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} and characterize three typical West Antarctic Peninsula continental margin depositional environments. Seismic, downhole and laboratory tools and techniques were applied to record physical and chemical proxies for a mulifacetted and differenciated understanding of the particular environments. 1) A detailed seismostratigraphic characterisation of the unique Antarctic inner and outer shelf along the passive margin of the West Antarctic Peninsula has been complemented by logging informations that are tied to the seismic profiles via a new continuous depth vs. velocity profile. Sealevel fall overcompensated by increased isostatic subsidence due to ice build-up that affected the continent and the adjacent shelfs is the most likely explanation for time synchronous start of topset preservation at ~ 2. 8 Ma observed in Antarctic Peninsula and East Antarctic shelf records in conjunction with Nothern Hemnisphere Glaciation. 2) Seismostratigraphic Model of Palmer Deep based on seismic Deep Tow Boomer records. 3) Large mounts on the continental rise along the Antarctic Peninsula margin between 63 °S and 69 °S and within 200 km of the shelf break are interpreted as sediment drifts, separated by turbidity current channels. Using a special standardized moving window counting routine the spatial facies information data has been transformed into a regional Antarctic Peninsula <b>ice</b> volume <b>indicator</b> curve that is in good agreement with the Lear et al., 2000 data over the past 10 Ma.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new, detailed geomorphological and sedimentological {{appraisal of the}} southern Svartenhuk Halvø, a remote area of West Greenland that has only been subjected to limited geomorphological and sedimentological research. Despite this, it is of importance as several studies have suggested it remained an ice-free enclave during the Last Glacial Maximum. This previous work, based on biostratigraphic and chronological evidence, has provided evidence for the ‘Svartenhuk Marine Event’, a period of ice free conditions and marine deposition into a higher than present relative sea-level during the previous interglacial (MIS 5 a–e). This has been correlated to other interglacial deposits in West Greenland. New geomorphological and sedimentological investigations from this study present compelling arguments for the glaciation of southern Svartenhuk Halvø by valley glaciers and mountain ice caps, questioning the status of this peninsula as an ice-free enclave. <b>Ice</b> directional <b>indicators</b> and clast lithological results suggest ice covering Svartenhuk Halvø was sourced from the higher altitude interior of the peninsula and expanded to the present coastline. In a number of valleys, sedimentological evidence points to at least two glacial advances with subglacial till production through the reworking of glaciomarine sediments, and ice contact and glacier-fed delta deposition during phases of ice retreat. The geomorphological and sedimentological context of the sediments (Gilbert type deltas), coupled with evidence for eskers and kettled/pitted delta surfaces, suggests these features formed under glacial and not interglacial conditions. This is supported by new radiocarbon dates which suggest outlet glacier advance and retreat across the area {{towards the end of}} MIS 3 and possibly into the Early Holocene. Svartenhuk Halvø was not overrun by the main Greenland Ice Sheet during the last glacial cycle, but the development of an independent ice cap and local outlet glaciers across this region may have been instrumental in determining the dynamic evolution of the Uummannaq ice stream onset zone during the last glacial cycle...|$|R

Rapid and environmentally safe sample processing {{was made possible by}} the use of a focused microwave digestion unit that scrubbed acid fumes. In situ and/or reworked dinocysts (dinoflagellate cysts), acritarchs (leiospheres and acanthomorphs), and prasinophyte phycomata are present in the 35 samples studied. Overall, the CRP- 1 assemblages are similar to Arctic marine palynomorph assemblages that are used there as <b>ice</b> margin <b>indicators.</b> Some of the acanthomorph acritarchs recovered from the CRP- 1 core closely resemble cysts of extant Antarctic autotrophic sea-ice dinoflagellates. It is possible that some of these acanthomorphs are actually dinocysts, and could be used as indicators of sea-ice conditions similar to today. Most of the in situ marine palynomorphs are undescribed taxa and thus are presently of little biostratigraphic value. Dating of the core was based on diatom, palaeomagnetic and strontium isotope studies. The upper 43. 55 mbsf of the core are Quaternary in age {{and the rest of the}} core, down to the bottom at 147. 69 mbsf, is of early Miocene age. Although not biostratigraphically significant, the dinocysts are the first in situ Quaternary and Miocene dinocysts reported from East Antarctica, and constitute the most diverse assemblage recovered from any firmly dated Neogene section from Antarctica. In addition, they confirm that cyst-producing dinoflagellates were present in Antarctic waters during the Neogene and Quaternary. The core can be divided into three intervals based on their palynomorph assemblages (Quaternary, 0 - 43. 55 mbsf; lower Miocene, 43. 55 - 99. 10 mbsf; and lower Miocene, 99. 10 - 147. 69 mbsf).

Developments of sea surface temperature and sea ice in the past provide crucial information on paleoceanographic variability. The aim of this thesis is to establish a diatom-based transfer function for sea surface temperature and to reconstruct the Late Pleistocene paleoceanographic history based on diatom assemblages, in order to improve the understanding of the North Pacificâ s role in the global glacial-interglacial climate changes. The thesis consists of three studies, of which the results are presented in three manuscripts. In the first study, a new diatom data set was generated from 422 surface sediments, covering a broad range of environmental variables of the northern North Pacific, the Sea of Okhotsk and the Bering Sea. The diatom biogeographic distribution patterns of 38 species and species groups were mapped. Statistical analysis discloses that 32 species and species groups have strong correspondence with the pattern of summer sea surface temperature (SSST). This close relationship between diatom assemblages and the SSST is useful in deriving a transfer function in the northern North Pacific for the quantitative paleoceanographic studies. In addition, the relative abundance of the sea <b>ice</b> <b>indicator</b> diatoms Fragilariopsis cylindrus and F. oceanica of > 20 % in the diatom composition is used to represent the winter sea ice maximum extent in the Bering Sea. In the second research project, a new diatom-based transfer function for SSST reconstructions was established based on 206 surface sediment samples with 32 species and species groups recovered in the northern North Pacific and its marginal seas. The SSST was estimated by three different techniques: the Imbrie and Kipp Method (IKM), the Modern Analog Technique (MAT) and the Artificial Neural Network technique (ANN). All the SSST estimates for surface samples derived from three methods show high correlations with the modern observations. The transfer functions based on IKM, MAT and ANN were tested on a sediment core retrieved from the western North Pacific for the last 180 ka (ka= 103 yr). The SSST reconstruction, although with low glacial-interglacial temperature amplitudes of 1. 5 - 2 ÂÂÂÂÂ°C, displays clear climate variability patterns. The reconstructed SSST is consistent with the local planktonic Ã ´ 18 O record and the NGRIP Ã ´ 18 O profile, indicating its potential for paleoceanographic reconstruction in the region. In the third study, diatom records from both the eastern and western North Pacific demonstrate glacial-interglacial variability for the last 160 ka. The diatom-derived SSSTs show uninterrupted temperature reconstructions in the northern North Pacific, covering the whole last glacial-interglacial cycle {{for the first time in}} the region. The sea ice diatom and cold water species imply ice-free environment for the last 160 ka in the eastern and western North Pacific open ocean. A possible sea ice expansion during Heinrich Event 1 is indicated by high abundance of cold water diatoms as well as sea ice biomarker from previous studies. An ocean basin-wide east-lead-and-west-lag phenomenon has been discovered in the eastern and western North Pacific during the Termination I and II. It is likely that the mountain glaciers in northwestern America responded faster to the increased summer insolation during the terminations, and discharged huge amount of melting water into the nearby open ocean, which consequently changed the surface environment earlier in the eastern North Pacific The studies of this thesis document the diatom distribution in the northern North Pacific surface sediments and discover a close relationship between the diatom assemblages and the SSST, which is fundamental for a quantitative paleoceanographic study based on diatom fossils. Accordingly, a new diatom-based transfer function for SSST reconstructions is established and applied to sediment cores, providing continuous SSST records for the first time in the northern North Pacific for the last 160 ka. The reconstructed SSST records show similar patterns with the global climate variability records elsewhere. During the terminations, diatom records also display a basin wide lead-and-lag phenomenon, implying possible local imprints on global climate signals...|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that long series of lake ice {{observations}} can serve as a proxy climate records, and the monitoring of freeze-up and break-up trends may provide a convenient integrated and seasonally specific index of climatic perturbations. Some authors (e. g. Livingstone, 1997) are of the opinion that historical lake ice records may be a more reliable indicator of past local and regional climatic changes than even air temperature records themselves, since the latter are frequently subject to inhomogeneities and bias resulting in station alterations and observer changes. In particular, inter-annual variations in lake ice cover duration and thickness may allow estimates of local climatic variability and long-term changes in lake ice phenology may provide a robust indication of climatic change. For these reasons, there is a growing interest in examining the utility of lake <b>ice</b> parameters as <b>indicators</b> of climate variability and change at northern latitudes. This study describes how lake ice parameters (freeze-up dates, break-up dates, and ice cover duration) can be affected by climate variability and change over a 24 -year period (1963 – 1987) for 28 sites located near or above treeline in Canada. A number of lake sites were selected via queries in the Canadian Ice Database (CID) using latitude above 60 °N as the main search criterion (Lenormand et al., 2002). The second criterio...|$|R
40|$|Carbon dioxide (CO 2) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{relevant}} and abundant species in astrophysical and atmospheric media. In particular, CO 2 ice is present in several solar system bodies, as well as in interstellar and circumstellar ice mantles. The amount of CO 2 in ice mantles and the presence of pure CO 2 <b>ice</b> are significant <b>indicators</b> of the temperature history of dust in protostars. It is therefore important to know if CO 2 is mixed with other molecules in the ice matrix or segregated and whether it is present in an amorphous or crystalline form. We apply a multidisciplinary approach involving IR spectroscopy in the laboratory, theoretical modeling of solid structures, and comparison with astronomical observations. We generate an unprecedented highly amorphous CO 2 ice and study its crystallization both by thermal annealing and by slow accumulation ofmonolayers from the gas phase under an ultrahigh vacuum. Structural changes are followed by IR spectroscopy. We also devise theoretical models to reproduce different CO 2 ice structures. We detect a preferential in-plane orientation of some vibrational modes of crystalline CO 2. We identify the IR features of amorphous CO 2 ice, and, in particular, we provide a theoretical explanation for a band at 2, 328 cm- 1 that dominates the spectrum of the amorphous phase and disappears when the crystallization is complete. Our results allow us to rule out the presence of pure and amorphous CO 2 ice in space based on the observations available so far, supporting our current view of the evolution of CO 2 ice. © 2013 National Academy of SciencesSupported by Projects FIS 2010 - 16455, PR 2010 - 0012, AYA 2011 - 29375, and CSD 2009 - 00038 of the Spanish Ministry of Education and JAE Doc Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientíﬁcas ProgrammePeer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 1986 Dr. Philip Edward O'BrienThis study investigates the sedimentology and geochemistry of Permian glacial sediments cropping out in the Bacchus Marsh and Derrinal areas in central Victoria and in the subsurface beneath the Cainozoic Murray Basin in Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia. Facies analysis of the Bacchus Marsh Formation, based on a critical review of literature on glacial sedimentary processes and environments, identifies the following major facies groups: 1. Subglacial tillites deposited beneath wet-based ice. Some of these tillites exhibit structures indicative {{of a number of}} subglacial processes such as frictional lodgement of large clasts, subglacial bed deformation, subglacial meltwater flow and subglacial size sorting of clasts. Other subglacial tillites are essentially structureless. 2. Bedded diamictites to sandstones deposited predominantly by ice-rafting of debris into standing water. 3. Fluvial outwash sandstone and conglomerate facies that are finer-grained than typical proglacial outwash facies. 4. Deltas and subaqueous outwash fans vary from sandy sediments deposited by proglacial and subglacial streams to coarse, poorly sorted complexes deposited as debris aprons close to the ice front. Abundant underflow deposits suggest that less than normal marine salinities prevailed in these water bodies, even if they were arms of the sea. 5. Supraglacial tillites consisting of sandy diamictites to pebble conglomerates. Facies in the thickest sequence in the Bacchus Marsh area suggests that the area was covered by a major ice mass at least 8 times. Minor glacial advances took place during predominantly ice-free periods. The Derrinal Formation consists of a basal unit of predominantly subglacial tillite deposited in shallow glacially excavated valleys overlain by a complex of subglacial and supraglacial facies deposited by about 8 minor advances of a small ice tongue. Facies relationships {{in this part of the}} sequence are confused by intense deformation of the sediment pile during the melting of buried ice and dewatering of saturated diamictons. A major ice advance then overwhelmed the area depositing thick subglacial tillite. The Urana Formation, beneath the Murray Basin, is dominated by marine ice-rafted diamictite and mudstone. Rhythmically bedded siltstone and claystone, sediment gravity-flow deposits, traction-current deposits, and, possibly, subglacial tillites are also present. Facies assemblages in some drill holes indicate areas that were never covered by grounded glacial ice. Sedimentological and palaeontological evidence suggests that the Urana Formation was deposited towards the end of the glaciation. <b>Ice</b> motion <b>indicators</b> and <b>ice</b> sheet limits inferred from the facies assemblages in the Urana Formation are used to estimate the thickness of the ice over central Victoria during glacial maxima. These estimates support the conclusion drawn from the facies analysis that the ice was a large ice sheet. Comparisons of ice movement directions for central Victoria and formerly adjacent parts of Gondwana suggest that a large ice sheet was centred in North Victorialand. Major and some trace elements analyses of the clay component of marine and non-marine diamictites were used to test a number of methods of distinguishing marine from nonmarine glacial diamictites. None of the methods were clearly successful because sediment detrital mineralogy dominates the geochemical composition though V/Cr ratios may be useful in some circumstances. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|Quaternary {{geological}} mapping is performed by geological surveys in most countries. At the Geological Survey of Norway (NGU), mapping of the surficial deposits {{has been one}} of the main tasks from the establishment of the institution in 1858, in the beginning mainly as an aid for agriculture and forestry. During recent decades, society's needs for information on the Quaternary deposits has increased, particularly within the fields of environment and health, physical planning, economy and supply of natural resources. Geological mapping is not looked upon as a science by everyone, but its results have often proved to be valuable in a scientific context as the extensive database the maps represent give valuable information, useful in, e. g. the study of regional trends. Geological mapping can, however, be regarded as a journey of discovery, which is the basis for most scientific research on the development of the earth's crust and which provides a framework with which all laboratory-based research must be compatible. Much detail information is also recorded (analog or digital), for example the location of exposed sections in distant areas and details beyond the reach of aerial photo interpretation, e. g. in heavily forested areas or of objects too small to be identified on aerial photos or maps. In addition, much sedimentological and stratigraphical work has to be performed during the fieldwork in order to understand the genesis of the deposits. Creation of geological models of the areas is an important part of the mapping activity that is necessary for attainment of an understanding of the Quaternary geological history on a regional scale. What could be criticized is the fact that the many mapping geologists involved have not used, or have had the opportunity to use, the enormous data at hand to do more science and to tell the layman what the results of the {{geological mapping}} mean. This thesis is a contribution to understanding of the Quaternary geology of Central Fennoscandia with special emphasis on the Nordland area. The thesis has the following aims: A. To compile four Quaternary geological maps of Central Fennoscandia (showing surficial deposits, geomorphology and paleohydrography, <b>ice</b> flow <b>indicators</b> and stratigraphy) and a Quaternary geological map of the surficial deposits of Nordland. B. To create a link between the Quaternary geological maps, applications of the map-data and studies of Quaternary geological history (Part I). C. To present a coordinated description of the five Quaternary geological maps and compile a review of the Late Weichselian and Early Holocene deglaciation history of the mapped area (Part II). D. To identify areas for in-depth investigation of the deglaciation and to perform these studies (Part III). A.

40|$|A {{wide-band}} penetrating {{radar system}} {{for measuring the}} thickness of sea ice is under development. The need for this or a similar system arises as follows: Spatial and temporal variations in the thickness of sea <b>ice</b> are important <b>indicators</b> of heat fluxes between the ocean and atmosphere and, hence, are important indicators of climate change in polar regions. A remote-sensing system that could directly measure the thickness of sea ice over a wide thickness range from aboard an aircraft or satellite would be of great scientific value. Obtaining thickness measurements over a wide region at weekly or monthly time intervals would contribute significantly to understanding {{of changes in the}} spatial distribution and of the mass balance of sea ice. A prototype of the system was designed on the basis of computational simulations directed toward understanding what signal frequencies are needed to satisfy partly competing requirements to detect both bottom and top ice surfaces, obtain adequate penetration despite high attenuation in the lossy sea-ice medium, and obtain adequate resolution, all over a wide thickness range. The prototype of the system is of the frequency-modulation, continuous-wave (FM-CW) type. At a given time, the prototype functions in either of two frequency-band/operational-mode combinations that correspond to two thickness ranges: a lower-frequency (50 to 250 MHz) mode for measuring thickness greater than about 1 m, and a higher frequency (300 to 1, 300 MHz) mode for measuring thickness less than about 1 m. The bandwidth in the higher-frequency (lesser-thickness) mode is adequate for a thickness resolution of 15 cm; the bandwidth in the lower-frequency (greater-thickness) mode is adequate for a thickness resolution of 75 cm. Although a thickness resolution of no more than 25 cm is desired for scientific purposes, the 75 -cm resolution was deemed acceptable for the purpose of demonstrating feasibility. The prototype was constructed as a modified version of a 500 -to- 2, 000 -MHz FM-CW radar system developed previously for mapping near-surface internal layers of the Greenland ice sheet. The prototype included two sets of antennas: one for each frequency-band/mode. For Arctic and Antarctic field tests, the prototype was mounted on a sled that was towed across the ice. The Arctic field test was performed in the lower-frequency mode on ice ranging in thickness from 1 to 4 m. In the analysis {{of the results of the}} Arctic field test, a comparison of the radar-determined ice thicknesses with actual ice thicknesses yielded an overall mean difference of 14 cm and standard deviation of 30 cm. The Antarctic field test was performed in the higher-frequency mode; analysis of the results led to the conclusion that this mode is useful for measuring thicknesses between 0. 5 and 1 m. Several modifications have been conceived for implementation in further development toward an improved practical system: The system would function in a single frequency-band/mode (100 to 1, 200 MHz) that would afford a resolution of about 15 cm. There would be a single antenna system that would be optimized for the entire 100 -to- 1, 000 -MHz frequency band. To enable ice-thickness surveys over larger areas, the system would be made capable of operating aboard a low-flying aircraft that could be either piloted or robotic. Data-processing techniques to deconvolve the system response have been developed on the basis of impulse-response measurements over a calm ocean. Implementation of these techniques in the system would enable correction for imperfections of the system and would thereby increase the effective sensitivity of the system...|$|R
40|$|It is {{important}} to study subglacial environments in northern Canada for many reasons, such as to develop a more comprehensive understanding of glacial landscape development and to aid in mineral exploration. The purpose {{of this research is}} improve understanding of the Quaternary Geology of north central Hall Peninsula, Baffin Island, the subglacial dynamics record in particular, in order to provide industry with new knowledge, maps and interpretations to aid in mineral exploration. The glacial history of north-central Hall Peninsula, Baffin Island is very complex. By studying the subglacial landscape using both remote- and field- based techniques it was possible to develop a subglacial landscape map and a flowset map which highlighted areas with different glacial histories and basal thermal regimes. The subglacial dynamics and how they changed spatially and temporally shaped the landscape to what it is today with a mixture of cold, intermediate, and warm-based ice. Through mapping using remote sensing and field methods, seven glacial landform and striation directions were found and grouped into four ice flow events. The identified ice flows include regional flows, northern and eastern fjord influenced areas, central deglacial flows, and modern icecap flows. Subglacial erosion was investigated using several proxies including streamlined hill elongation ratios, streamlined hill density, and bedrock controlled lake density studies. These proxies together with the subglacial landscape map were overlaid to select discrete zones, termed glacial terrain zones (GTZs), in an attempt to analyze the subglacial dynamics and how different basal thermal regimes interacted with the landscape. Five glacial terrain zones (GTZs) were identified, with different spatio-temporal basal ice regimes and landform assemblages. The first zone (GTZ 1) is characterized by an expansive flowset of parallel paleo-flow indicators trending northeast. This zone has the highest degree of areal scour with thin, discontinuous and relatively unweathered till. The second zone, GTZ 2, is an area where the broad northeast flowset is crosscut locally by <b>ice</b> flow <b>indicators</b> that converge into troughs that now form a series of north trending fjords in the north of the study area. This overprinted landscape is found to propagate inland forming a channelized system, leading way to linear erosion. The modern icecap resides in GTZ 3, which inherited the broad northeast flowset, but is overprinted in valleys by eastern flows funneling into the fjords to the east, as well as western flows flowing from the modern icecap. In the central area, there is a rolling terrain of thicker till (GTZ 4) that is distinguished by its lack of subglacial features. The final contrasting landscape (GTZ 5) is characterized by southeast trending bedrock features (most likely enhanced by southeast flowing ice) and associated perpendicular moraines. GTZ 5 is also characterized by highly weathered bedrock, and locally by landform assemblages recording late deglacial readvances of thin lobes including moraines and striated outcrops. Geochemical studies for each of these landscapes lead to additional insights, characterizing the five zones further. The geochemical studies took advantage of two till sample databases taken over the study area for exploration purposes by Peregrine Diamonds LTD. The chemical index of alteration (CIA) was applied to compare erosion in the different zones. High CIA values indicate high weathering, where low CIA values low weathering. GTZ 1 is characterized by low CIA values (low weathering footprint), and GTZ 5 is characterized by high CIA value (highly weathered). To study if the GTZs had a distinct geochemical signature, as well as a signature landscape, multivariate geochemical statistics (Principal Component Analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis) were done over the study area. Interestingly, {{it was found that the}} GTZs have geochemical signatures, which reflect the role of underlying bedrock, weathering patterns, glacial dispersal, and the complex relationships between subglacial dynamics and landscape evolution. To determine if the GTZs could be predicted by the till geochemistry, linear discriminant analysis was subsequently applied. The results indicate that the till geochemical data has a predictive capacity with an accuracy of 83. 78 %, which brings insight into the relationship between glacial landscapes and till composition. With this multi-proxy approach and building from previous studies, a conceptual model was developed for the study area. During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the study area was inundated by the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS), with the Hall Ice Divide parallel to the axis of the peninsula with ice flowing from the divide to the northeast and southwest. As ice thinned, GTZ 1, an area once inundated with warm-based ice, as shown by evidence of areal scour and low CIA values, switched to being cold-based ice preserving an older landscape. Though GTZ 1 was under cold-based ice, warm-based conditions still prevailed within the channelized flow zones, which characterize GTZ 2. Evidence of this is found in the striation record, as well as the low CIA value indicative of low weathering (or high erosion). This may reflect a transition from LGM (thick-based ice) to thinner, topographically controlled ice, with cold-based ice in interfluves and hilltops, during early deglaciation. The catchment zones of the channelized system locally extend near the central area (GTZ 4) which is reflected in dispersal patterns and the striation record. As the LIS retreated, it went through a series of southeastward readvances and surges (GTZ 5). Though the ice was warm-based near the moraines in GTZ 5, prevailing cold-based conditions prevailed during most of the last glacial cycle, and the late deglacial readvances had limited erosion capacity and did not overprint the cold-based landscape significantly. This is shown by the CIA values indicative of high weathering, and lack of subglacial landforms. Series of pro-glacial lakes also formed in front of the retreating lobe. Ice is needed over GTZ 1 to prevent these lakes from draining northward. This thin ice was most likely cold-based, preserving the older GTZ 1 landscape of areal scouring. The glacial landscape of Hall Peninsula appears to record a switch from uniform warm-based LGM ice, which was laterally extensive, to localized channel flows in the fjords during deglaciation and intervening cold-based ice. The change in the geometry and basal thermo-mechanical conditions may be the prologue to the separation of the modern day ice cap from the LIS...|$|R
