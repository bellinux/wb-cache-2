Therefore, an efficient surface transportation system enhances a nation 2 ̆ 7 s livability and economic competitiveness. In recent years, projects {{have become more}} complex and uncertain due to increases {{in the number of}} effective project elements and interactions that can influence the project. Therefore, traditional project management that track and controls time, cost, and technical issues through the project development process cannot manage the higher risk and uncertainty associated with complex projects. Shane et al. developed five dimensions of project management for complex projects through a case study research on national and international complex projects. The research group found that finance and context are two extra dimensions that highly affect project 2 ̆ 7 s complexity. The present transportation financing methods consist of a complex set of federal, state, and local revenue sources which cannot answer the present and future growing need. Therefore, introducing alternative new and innovative financing methods is important to assist states in practicing them to fulfill their growing transportation infrastructure need. In addition, with consideration to tight resources and limitations that financing issues can put on the project (e. g. long delays), project management and finance management become more vital through complex projects.
