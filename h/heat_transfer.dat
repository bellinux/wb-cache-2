5|$|The {{radiation}} zone is {{the region of}} the stellar interior where the flux of energy outward is dependent on radiative <b>heat</b> <b>transfer,</b> since convective <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> is inefficient in that zone. In this region the plasma will not be perturbed, and any mass motions will die out. If this is not the case, however, then the plasma becomes unstable and convection will occur, forming a convection zone. This can occur, for example, in regions where very high energy fluxes occur, such as near the core or in areas with high opacity (making radiatative <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> inefficient) as in the outer envelope.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2003 A {{computational}} model is developed {{to study the}} effects of alumina layer formation on an ablative surface when exposed to high temperature particle laden gas flow. The solidification dynamics i. e., the solid and liquid alumina layer growth rate, and the <b>heat</b> <b>transferred</b> to the ablative surface are investigated. A one-dimensional model is developed taking into consideration the thermal loading, particle loading and the temperature dependence of the thermo-physical properties of alumina. A fully implicit finite volume method is used to solve the coupled set of non-linear heat conduction equations. The solidification interface is tracked using the Lagrangian interpolation technique. The particle mass flux was found to be the major factor affecting the solid layer growth rate. The gas heat flux also has a major effect on the solid growth rate and the <b>heat</b> <b>transferred</b> to the ablative surface, but only for lower particle mass fluxes. On other hand the particle temperature has a linear effect on the solidification dynamics and the <b>heat</b> <b>transferred</b> to the ablative surface for all particle mass fluxes.
