The major problem in analyzing data from the RD design is model misspecification. If the regression equation or statistical model {{does not reflect the}} data distribution, then biased estimates of the treatment effect will occur.

There are four nucleobases: guanine (G), Adenine (A), Thymine (T), and Cytosine (C). A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is a mutation at a single nucleotide position, where a possible nucleotide type is called an allele. For example, there are two nucleotides in the following two DNA fragments in the fourth position: CCACGTT and CCATGTT. In this case, we say that the SNP has two alleles, C and T. Although the polymorphism may consist of two, three, or four alleles, the triallelic and tetraallelic SNPs are extremely rare.

40|$|Abstract: Radiolaria, {{as other}} plankton, {{appear to be}} highly tuned to {{specific}} oceano-graphic environments. Thus, in a transitional region such as the eastern North Pacific, where many different water masses are mixed, radiolaria provide very sensitive tracers of these water masses and the currents that carry them. We present {{the first two years}} of radiolarian results from the Multitracers ediment trap study across the northcrn California Current System. Three moorings, positioned along a transect at approximately 130, 280 and 650 km from the coast, sample a wide variety of oceanographic conditions both spatially and temporally. Selected species or spccics groups are presented along with hydrographic data from the region in order to demonstrate <b>he</b> <b>basic</b> trends in the radiolarian data and illustrate their relationships tofluctuations in their physical environ-mcnt. Multiple linear regression is used to cxplore the relationship between radiolarian composition and the export of carbon from this system. The most important physical process controlling variability in the radiolarian composition along this transect is attributed to variability in the intensity of the southward-flowing California Current. The seasonality of the California Current is clearly reflected b...|$|E

In actual practice, however, the criteria of purity are difficult to define, particularly {{in view of the fact}} that mere traces of certain factors’ 43 #{ 176 } suffice to cause a considerable degree of activation if operating over a long enough period. Such “trace impurities ” quite fail to show up in the usual criteria, e. g., constant solubility, 6 ’ unicomponent electrophoretic pattern and iso-electric point, 6 ’ and other data valid in protein chemistry. 7 It is most necessary, therefore, to supplement the examination of “purified ” clotting agents with a series of sensitive tests for the presence and modes of action of these impurity factors.

Neither the anatomy or function of the inguinal mechanism nor any of its con-stituent parts-the muscles, ligaments, fascia, and nerves-are in any way defective.

40|$|Continuous {{improvement}} {{continues to}} be the rallying point for Department of Defense (DoD) acquisition reform. The recent changes to the DoD 5000 show that the department is streamlining the acquisition process to meet the realities of the evolving “new world ” threats. As dramatic as the changes have been, there is room for improvement. Here we compare the streamlined DoD acquisition process with the process used in the American automobile industry—which continually deals with an ever-evolving threat. We discuss the Chrysler Corporation product development process and identify the “best practices ” in their product development process. These best practices {{can be applied to the}} DoD acquisition process. 1 <b>he</b> <b>basic</b> tenets of the current Depart-ment of Defense (DoD) acquisition reform are “better, faster, cheaper. ” The acquisition reforms have resulted in a new DoD 5000 rule which dictates what should be performed during a major sys-tem acquisition, not how to perform one. Using the new 5000, the systems devel-oped should be: 1. Better. A high-quality system must be designed and built right the first time. 2. Cheaper. The costs of developing, building, fielding, and maintaining the system are constrained more so than in the past. 3. Faster. The streamlined process re-duces the amount of time required to acquire and properly field sys-tems. The idea of DoD acquisition reform is not new. Since the DoD 5000 was first is-sued in 1971, there have been nine revi-sions in an effort to streamline and fine tune the DoD acquisition proces...|$|E
40|$|This is a morphologic {{study of}} 41 cases of dextrocardia {{for the purpose}} of {{clarifying}} terminology and evaluating the clinical import of the morphologic data. Dextrocardias are classified as dextroversion, mirror-image dextrocardia, and mixed dextrocardia. When the atrial septum does not identifv the atria, it was found possible to make the presumptive diagnosis of dextroversion or mirror-image dextrocardia. The mutual rela-tions of the visceral situs with the atrial situs, {{the presence or absence of}} splenic abnormalities, the type of dextrocardia, and the systemic and pulmonic venous return were investigated, as well as the type of complex that is characteristic of each type of dextrocardia. The most important morphologic data useful for clinical application were found to be the position of the aortic and pulmonic annuli, the course of the pulmonary trunk, the entry of the inferior and superior venae cavae, and the course of the anterior descending coronary artery.

40|$|The present study, {{evaluated}} and compared {{the effects of}} SRI 63 - 441, a potent platelet activating factor antagonist, superoxide dismutase (SOD), an oxygen free radical scavenger, and ibuprofen, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor on hepatic function after 90 minutes of warm ischemia. After warm ischemia, livers were harvested and underwent 90 minutes of warm, oxygenated, sanguinous perfusion on an isolated liver perfusion apparatus. Pretreatment of donor animals with 20 mg/kg intravenous (I. V.) SRI 63 - 441 5 minutes before induction of total hepatic ischemia resulted in significantly increased bile production, {{a significant decrease in}} transaminase release, and a higher tissue adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content when compared with ischemic non-treated controls. SOD resulted in improved bile production and decreased transaminase liberation only when present in the perfusate at the time of in vitro reperfusion. Ibuprofen did not improve postischemic hepatic function in this model. Electron microscopy revealed patchy hepatocellular vacuolization with an intact sinusoidal endothelium in all ischemic livers. However, the degree of damage was less severe in the livers from those rats pretreated with 20 mg/kg SRI 63 - 441. This study demonstrates that SRI 63 - 441 pretreatment significantly reduces hepatic warm ischemic injury, and in the present model, appears superior to two other agents that have been advanced in the treatment of ischemic injury. The use of such agents singly or in combinations have important implications as regards gaining a better understanding of <b>he</b> <b>basic</b> mechanisms in organ ischemia, and moreover, for therapeutic applications in organ ischemia and preservation...|$|E

40|$|Emergency {{planning}} {{is an important}} practice that allows government officials and planners to prepare for disasters and to make prompt response s that can save lives and property. One of the foremost concern s during an emergency is to save as many lives as possible. Thus, whethe r people can leave the disaster areas safely and efficiently is a prime consideration in emergency planning and management. Usually, transportation planners use a four - step model to predict sy s- tem - level performance regarding how people move from on e place to another, and to determine the network ’ s weak points and critical areas. In this project, a computer - based software package, TransCAD, is used to evaluate traffic impacts of the evacuation of riverside communities in Franklin County, Massachusetts {{in the event of}} flood caused by a hypothetical failure of the Ha r- riman Dam. Th is scenario was partially designed by representatives of Franklin County. The probable maximum flood (PMF) case is considered; for safety concerns, an evacuation - planning zone (EPZ) is defined as 500 f ee t beyond inundation area. O ne important concern is that peo ple living upstream, near the dam, have much less time to evacu ate than those who live downstream. T <b>he</b> <b>basic</b> consideration behind the model is to evacuate people in a progressive manner in order {{to take into account the}} dynamic nature of flood.

40|$|The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) is envisioned to be {{the next}} major step in the world`s fusion program from the present {{generation}} of tokamaks and is designed to study fusion plasmas with a reactor relevant range of plasma parameters. During normal operation, it is expected that a fraction of the unburned tritium, that is used to routinely fuel the discharge, will be retained together with deuterium on the surfaces and in the bulk of the plasma facing materials (PFMs) surrounding the core and divertor plasma. The understanding of <b>he</b> <b>basic</b> retention mechanisms (physical and chemical) involved and their dependence upon plasma parameters and other relevant operation conditions is necessary for the accurate prediction of the amount of tritium retained at any given time in the ITER torus. Accurate estimates are essential to assess the radiological hazards associated with routine operation and with potential accident scenarios which may lead to mobilization of tritium that is not tenaciously held. Estimates are needed to establish the detritiation requirements for coolant water, to determine the plasma fueling and tritium supply requirements, and to establish the needed frequency and the procedures for tritium recovery and clean-up. The organization of this paper is as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the design and operating conditions of the main components which define the plasma boundary of ITER. Section 3 reviews the erosion database and the results of recent relevant experiments conducted both in laboratory facilities and in tokamaks. These data provide the experimental basis and serve as an important benchmark for both model development (discussed in Section 4) and calculations (discussed in Section 5) that are required to predict tritium inventory build-up in ITER. Section 6 emphasizes the need to develop and test methods to remove the tritium from the codeposited C-based films and reviews the status and the prospects of the most attractive techniques.
