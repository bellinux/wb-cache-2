500|$|Kenneth Wayne Thomas, in Intrinsic Motivation at Work, {{described}} {{the book as}} [...] "somewhat sympathetic" [...] to Erhard and the est philosophy; Steve Jackson, writing in Westword, similarly included it among [...] "books sympathetic to Erhard, est and Landmark", written by an [...] "old friend of Erhard's". Stephen Goldstein, in a Washington Post review, said Bartley had made it [...] "obvious {{from the start that}} he cares about his subject and his own est experience" [...] and had told [...] "a rather simple, straightforward story that pretty much lets you <b>draw</b> <b>your</b> own conclusions [...] or keep the ones you have already reached." [...] A reviewer in [...] stated he was [...] "enthusiastic about this book", praising the [...] "personal quality [...] the narrative, which, though, sometimes becomes overly detailed." [...] He highly recommended the book for general and college libraries focused on the social sciences.|$|E

Chuck directly compares their attempting to sneak in to Vivian's base to the same method used by Luke Skywalker and Han Solo to rescue Princess Leia in the original film, by referring to the bound Casey as [...] "Chewie." [...] During the same scene Casey mutters [...] "I have a bad feeling about this," [...] a catch-phrase used by characters throughout the film series. The series is twice referenced directly, by Chuck when Sarah fails to understand his [...] "Chewie" [...] reference, and by Casey, who says, [...] "This {{is what happens when}} you <b>draw</b> <b>your</b> plans from Star Wars." [...] Chuck and Morgan also make use of [...] "The Imperial March" [...] as a means to prepare Morgan for his mission to pose as a villain while infiltrating a meeting with Vivian.|$|E

Student protesters at a camp in Maracay were attacked by armed motorcyclists that fired shots, threw Molotov cocktails and destroyed 30 tents at the camp leaving 5 students injured. During a protest in Lecheria, a student of Santa Maria University was shot near her head by police.

2500|$|While {{there were}} demands for {{productions}} from impresarios in various Italian cities, Verdi was loath {{to allow them}} unless he could be sure {{of the strength of}} the singers, and in spite of their pleas, the composer refused. As Budden notes, it came to be Venice [...] "that made an honest woman of Violetta" [...] when Verdi allowed a performance at the Teatro San Benedetto. Some revisions took place between 1853 and May 1854, mostly affecting acts 2 and 3, but the opera was given again on 6 May 1854 and was a great success, largely due to Maria Spezia-Aldighieri's portrayal of Violetta. [...] "Then [...] it was a fiasco; now it has created a furore. <b>Draw</b> <b>your</b> own conclusions!" [...] reported Piave (who had overseen the production in Verdi's absence).|$|E
2500|$|Blake's {{last years}} were spent at Fountain Court off the Strand (the {{property}} was demolished in the 1880s, when the Savoy Hotel was built). On {{the day of}} his death (12 August 1827), Blake worked relentlessly on his Dante series. Eventually, it is reported, he ceased working and turned to his wife, who was in tears by his bedside. Beholding her, Blake is said to have cried, [...] "Stay Kate! Keep just as you are – I will <b>draw</b> <b>your</b> portrait – for you have ever been an angel to me." [...] Having completed this portrait (now lost), Blake laid down his tools and began to sing hymns and verses. At six that evening, after promising his wife that he would be with her always, Blake died. Gilchrist reports that a female lodger in the house, present at his expiration, said, [...] "I have been at the death, not of a man, but of a blessed angel." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Mufti opposed all {{immigration}} of Jews into Palestine, {{and during the}} war he campaigned against the transfer of Jewish refugees to Palestine. No evidence has been forthcoming to show he was opposed to transferring Jews to countries outside the Middle East. The Mufti’s numerous letters appealing to various governmental authorities to prevent Jewish refugees from emigrating to Palestine have been republished and widely cited as documentary evidence of his participative support for the Nazi genocide. For instance, Husseini intervened on 13 May 1943, before the meeting with Himmler when he was informed of the Holocaust, with the German Foreign Office to block possible transfers of Jews from Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania to Palestine, after reports reached him that 4,000 Jewish children accompanied by 500 adults had managed to reach Palestine. He asked that the Foreign Minister [...] "to do his utmost" [...] to block all such proposals and this request was complied with. According to Idith Zertal, none of the documents presented at Eichmann's trial prove {{that it was the}} Mufti's interference, in these 'acts of total evil,' that prevented the children's rescue. [...] In June 1943 the Mufti recommended to the Hungarian minister {{that it would be better}} to send Jews in Hungary to concentration camps in Poland rather than let them find asylum in Palestine. [...] A year later, on 25 July 1944 [...] he wrote to the Hungarian foreign minister to register his objection to the release of certificates for 900 Jewish children and 100 adults for transfer from Hungary, fearing they might end up in Palestine. He suggested that if such transfers of population were deemed necessary, then:I ask your Excellency to permit me to <b>draw</b> <b>your</b> attention to the necessity of preventing the Jews from leaving your country for Palestine, and if there are reasons which make their removal necessary, it would be indispensable and infinitely preferable to send them to other countries where they would find themselves under active control, for example, in Poland, thus avoiding danger and preventing damage." ...|$|E
