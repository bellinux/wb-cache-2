40|$|Modern {{textiles}} {{in historical}} collections have been manufactured {{from some of}} the earliest commercial man-made polymers, but unlike their plastic and film counterparts with the same composition, aged fibers appear more physically stable. The main reasons for this lie in the different chemical and mechanical properties conferred on fiber polymers during their production. With a focus on domestic textile fibers manufactured before 1960, polymer factors such as orientation, crystallinity and chain length are considered for viscose rayon, cellulose acetate, regenerated protein, nylon, poly(acrylonitrile), poly(ester) and <b>elastane</b> (<b>spandex).</b> Viewed from past and recent polymer science literature, this paper offers an introduction to polymeric contexts for the current condition of historical textiles, especially those with a user life-time, and considerations for their preservation...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The garment {{stretch and}} {{recovery}} characteristics due to body movements can be indirectly assessed by the dynamic elastic recovery (DER) value of the fabrics at different extension levels. In order to study DER of elastic fabrics, a comparative analysis was made between spandex-plated cotton fabric and spandex core cotton spun (SCCS) fabric. It {{was found that the}} spandex-plated cotton fabric has higher DER value than that of SCCS fabric. The results of this study show that this phenomenon is due to the residual energy of the elastane unraveled from these fabrics. The stress values of these fabrics have no significant effect at 95 % confidence level. It is concluded that the spandex-plated cotton fabric is suitable than SCCS fabric, for the tight fit garments meant for the sports like Javelin, shot-put, and athletics.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognised}} that elastic <b>fibres</b> (<b>spandex</b> and lycra) {{are used to}} impart stretch to fabrics. The amount the apparel stretches to fit depends on the elastic fibres’ characteristics and recovery properties, in providing pressure comfort and ease of movement.

Building patternmaking theory {{can lead to a}} better understanding of the body to garment interaction, and the fit of apparel. This investigation commences with the identification of garment block construction methods for woven and jersey apparel, and corresponding garment fit expectations, comparing two published patternmaking methods. It proposes a system of adding bust cup grading into non-stretch garment blocks. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method would be easy to implement and could generate patterns with an improved bust girth fit. The purpose of this paper is to show that a new grading system would better serve the female population than the system currently in use.

Given the {{high incidence of}} meniscal injuries in horses, the clinical interest in these mechanoreceptors, particularly in the meniscus, and the lack of information concerning them in equine menisci, our objective was to study these corpuscles in the anterior horn of the equine medial meniscus, which is the most common localization reported for equine meniscal injuries.

40|$|International audienceTension wood, {{a tissue}} {{developed}} by angiosperm trees to actively recover their verticality, {{has long been}} defined {{by the presence of}} an unlignified cellulosic inner layer in the cell wall of fibres, called the G-layer. Although it was known that some species have no G-layer, the definition was appropriate since it enabled easy detection of tension wood zones using various staining techniques for either cellulose or lignin. For several years now, irrespective of its anatomical structure, tension wood has been defined by its high mechanical internal tensile stress. This definition enables screening of the diversity of cell walls in tension wood fibres. Recent results obtained in tropical species with tension wood with a delay in the lignification of the G-layer opened our eyes to the effective presence of large amounts of lignin in the G-layer of some species. This led us to review older literature mentioning the presence of lignin deposits in the G-layer and give them credit.

5000|$|By {{the end of}} June {{and early}} July Breton {{independent}}ists could {{take it for granted}} that Brittany could be independent when a military governor was appointed to rule over the five départements of ancient Brittany. After a self-designated Congress in Pontivy founded the Breton National Committee, Mordrel took charge of the PNB in late October, and subsequently led a campaign against Vichy France that was tacitly encouraged by the Germans. His relation with Célestin Lainé became tense after Lainé's paramilitary Lu Brezhon started competing with the National Committee in October. Mordrel's actions against Vichy did not have the intended effect, and the PNB's appeal was minimal; at the same time, Germany had started placing its trust with Vichy leader Philippe Pétain, and in the end supported Mordrel's ousting from the Committee in December. He seems to have been disappointed with the PNB's position himself. In November, he stated: [...] "Our force is within ourselves. Neither Vichy nor Berlin will render the Breton people the necessary status for self-determination, regrouping, and giving itself a path. Our fate is being decided in our <b>fibres...</b> Let <b>us</b> not expect anything that is not from ourselves". He resigned his positions with the PNB and its journal, being replaced by Raymond Delaporte.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} a new general polynomial-time construction- the fibre construction- which reduces any constraint satisfaction problem CSP(H) to the constraint satisfaction problem CSP(P), where P is any subprojective relational structure. As a consequence we get a new proof (not using universal algebra) that CSP(P) is NP-complete for any subprojective (and so for any projective) relational structure. The <b>fibre</b> construction allows <b>us</b> to prove the NP-completeness part of the conjectured Dichotomy Classification of CSPs, previously obtained by algebraic methods. We show that this conjectured Dichotomy Classification {{is equivalent to the}} dichotomy {{of whether or not the}} template is subprojective. This approach is flexible enough to yield NP-completeness of coloring problems with large girth and bounded degree restrictions thus reducing the Feder-Hell-Huang and Kostočka-Neˇsetˇril-Smolíková problems to the Dichotomy Classification of coloring problems. 1...|$|R

Starting from the coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equations an analytical {{solution for the}} evolution of the state of polarization, valid for fibres with large linear birefringence and quasi cw input light with arbitrary polarization, is given. It allows us to model straightforwardly go-and-return paths as in interferometers with standard or Faraday mirrors. In the experiment all the fluctuations in the linear birefringence, including temperature- and pressure-induced ones, are successfully removed in a passive way by using a double pass of the fibre under test with a Faraday mirror {{at the end of the}} <b>fibre.</b> This allows <b>us</b> to use long fibres and relatively low input powers.

40|$|Nonlinear optics {{enables the}} {{manipulation}} of the spectral and temporal features of light. We used the tailorable guidance properties of photonic crystal fibres to control and enhance nonlinear processeswith the aim of improving nonlinearity based optical sources. We utilised modern, high power, Ytterbium fibre lasers to pump either single photonic crystal fibres or a cascade of fibres with differing properties. Further extension of our control was realised with specifically tapered photonic crystal fibres which allowed for a continuous change in the fibre characteristics along their length. The majority of our work was concerned with supercontinuum generation. For continuous wave pumping we developed a statistical model {{of the distribution of}} soliton energies arising from modulational instability and used it to understand the optimum dispersion for efficient continuum expansion. A two-fold increase in spectral width was demonstrated, along with studies of the noise properties and pump bandwidth dependence of the continuum. For picosecond pumping we found that the supercontinuum bandwidth was limited by the four wave mixing phase-matching available in a single fibre. A technique to overcome this by using a cascade of fibres with different dispersion profiles was developed. Further improvement was achieved by using novel tapered PCFs to continuously extend the phase-matching. Analysis of this case showed that a key role was played by soliton trapping of dispersive waves and that our tapers strongly enhanced this effect. We demonstrated supercontinua spanning 0. 34 - 2. 4 ¹mwith an unprecedented spectral power; up to 5 mW/nm. The use of long, dispersion decreasing photonic crystal <b>fibres</b> enabled <b>us</b> to demonstrate adiabatic soliton compression at 1. 06 ¹m. From a survey of fibre structures we found that working around the second zero dispersion wavelength was optimal as this allows for decreasing dispersion without decreasing the nonlinearity.

40|$|Based {{on a broad}} {{literature}} review, {{this paper}} presents characteristics of new generation composites {{on the basis of}} cements which are applied in engineering structures and in rehabilitation of structures. The role of cement, microfillers, superplasticizers and fibers in the above stated composites i. e. factors which allow for the maximum packing of particles in the cement matrix and a minimum pore volume, and the increase in composite bending strength, have been discussed. Special attention was paid to Reactive Powder Concrete in which coarse aggregate was replaced by ground quartz and sand. Such composites contain active microfillers and the applied new-generation superplasticizers allow us to decrease the water-cement ratio in the composite up to 0. 2. Whereas, steel <b>fibre</b> additive allows <b>us</b> to significantly improve the bending strength. The paper presents the properties of the excellent Ductal — a composite from Reactive Powder Concrete, which at compressive strength from 180 to 230 MPa achieves the tensile strength of 30 to 50 MPa. Its application allows us to create slim profiles and tall light and slender, and simultaneously durable and corrosion-resistant structural elements of considerable span.

40|$|International audienceThe {{initiation}} of pyrotechnic substances by a laser light {{has been studied}} for more than 30 years. But until recently {{the use of this}} technology for defence applications encountered three main technical problems: the volume and the mass of lasers, the linear loss of optical fibres and their possible damage caused by the transport of strong laser power. Recent technical progress performed in the field of electrical and optical devices are now very promising for future opto-pyrotechnic functional chains. The objective {{of this paper is to}} present a demonstrator developed in order to initiate in a synchronous way four optical detonators and to measure the dispersion of their functioning times.

The set-up integrates also complex control and safety systems, as well as cameras allowing an optimal alignment of optical <b>fibres.</b> Experiments led <b>us</b> to initiate in a synchronous way four detonators with a mean scattering of 50 ns.

40|$|Failure {{patterns}} and mechanical behaviour of high performance fibre-reinforced cementitious composites depend {{to a large}} extent on the distribution of fibres within a specimen. A discrete treatment of <b>fibres</b> enables <b>us</b> to study the influence of various fibre distributions on the mechanical properties of the material. The numerical analysis of large numbers of arbitrarily distributed discrete thin fibres embedded in a continuum is how- ever a computationally demanding process. In this work, two different methodologies are proposed to model discrete fibres embedded in a continuum matrix. To ensure numerical efficiency, fibres are not explicitly discretized but they are superposed to a background mesh representing the continuous matrix material. In the first approach, the fibre-force approach, fibres are modelled by applying discrete forces to the background mesh. The background mesh represents the matrix while the discrete forces represent the interaction between fibres and matrix. These forces are assumed to be equal to fibre pull-out forces. With this approach, experimental data or micro mechanical models, including detailed information about the fibre-matrix interface, can be directly incorporated into the model. The second approach is based on the partition of unity property of finite element shape functions. The handling of discrete thin fibres embedded in the continuum matrix is made possible by a special enrichment function that represents the action of each fibre on the matrix. The constitutive behaviour of the matrix material, the fibre material and the fibre-matrix bond can be defined independently. In contrast to the fibre-force approach, the interaction between matrix and fibres is defined through the constitutive relation describing the bond-slip at the fibre interface. In both approaches the interaction of the fibres and a damaged matrix material is investigated. The partition of unity based approach is applied to experiments taken from literature. In addition to modelling of fibre-reinforced concrete, this approach is applied to concrete reinforced with rebars and with rebars and fibres. The comparison to available experimental results shows that the proposed methodology is able to capture the basic behaviour of the materials but indicates the need for an extension to three dimensions to represent the material behaviour in a realistic fashion. Both proposed approaches basically solve the initially posed problem to model discrete fibres embedded in a continuum without including the fibres into the finite element mesh.

40|$|The {{structure}} of natural flax fibres {{is complex and}} hierarchical, consisting of multiple concentric layers that differ in composition and function. Naturally grown fibres show significant variation in structure {{that is likely to}} be responsible for the observed scatter in mechanical properties, most notably strength and stiffness. As flax fibres are being considered as an alternative reinforcement in composite materials to replace synthetic fibres, understanding the origins of property variability is a major objective of their study. High resolution synchrotron X-ray tomography (voxel size ~ 0. 35 microns) on the TOMCAT station at the Swiss Light Source was used to create three-dimensional visualisation of the internal {{structure of}} individual flax fibres. Despite using the lowest X-ray energy available at the beamline (~ 8 keV), the contrast due to fibre absorption was quite low (about 2 % absorption), creating significant challenges for data interpretation. The problem of data interpretation was exacerbated by small random movements of the sample ("jitter") caused by the air currents within the experimental hutch. The presence of phase contrast associated with the <b>fibre</b> edges allowed <b>us</b> to develop efficient algorithms for image post-processing for the purpose of re-alignment of the datasets ("de-jittering"). As a result, sharp and clear 3 D visualisations of long segments of flax fibres were obtained. In addition to the well-known inner pore (lumen) running through the centre of the flax fibre, isolated cavities a few microns in diameter were found. The data also allows the assessment of fibre structure variation along its length. The data provides a valuable basis for attempting to cross-correlate these structural variations with the mechanical properties. © 2010 International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of semi-flexible fibres in shear flow {{and the effect}} of flexibility on the swimming speed of helical flagella are investigated. High aspect ratio particles such as carbon and glass fibres are often added as fillers to processed polymers. Although these materials have high rigidity, the large aspect ratiomakes the fibres liable to bending during flow. Other high aspect ratio fibres that behave as semi-flexible fibres include carbon nano-tubes, paper fibres and semi-flexible polymers such as the muscle protein f-actin. Most theoretical studies assume that fibres are either rigid or completely flexible, but in this thesis fibres with a finite bending modulus are considered. A semi-flexible fibre is modelled as a chain of shorter rods linked together. A bending torque is included at the joints between the rods to account for the rigidity. In shear flow the simulation reproduces the C and S turns observed in experiments on semi-flexible fibres. The results for finite aspect ratio fibres predict changes to the period of rotation and drift between Jeffery orbits. The direction of drift for a flexible fibre depends on both the intial orientation and the fibre’s flexiblity. We also present a linear analysis of how small distortions to a straight semi-flexible fibre grow when the flow places the fibre under compression. These results are in agreement with our full simulations and the growth rates of the distortions to a straight <b>fibre</b> allow <b>us</b> to predict the most unstable mode at a particular flow rate. To allow for intrinsically bent or helical equilibrium shapes a second simulation method is developed that includes a twisting torque at the joints between the rods as well as a bending torque. Using this simulation we measure the period of rotation and orbit drift of permanently deformed fibres in shear flow and show that due to the asymmetry of a helix, shear induced rotation results in translation and orbit drift for both rigid and semi-flexible fibres. Bacteria such as Vibrio alginolyticus and Escherichia coli swim by rotating one or more helical flagella. Vibrio alginolyticus has only one flagella and changes direction by altering its sense of rotation. Experimental observations of Vibrio alginolyticus have found that backwards swimming is 50 % faster than forwards swimming speed however, previous numerical simulation results have shown only a 4 % difference for flagella of the same dimensions. We use our simulation to consider how flexiblity affects the swimming speed of helical flagella and show that for a constant angular velocity, difference between forwards and backwards swimming speed ranges between 0 - 23 %depending on the exact stiffness chosen. We explain the differences in swimming speeds of semi-flexible fibres by investigating the shape changes which occur and comparing them to the results for swimming speeds of rigid flagella of varying dimensions.

5000|$|Electrophysiological {{recording}} {{studies of}} cerebellar cortex {{have helped to}} better understand the role that PCs play in the eyeblink CR learning process. McCormick and Thompson (1984b) recorded PC activity during eyeblink training and found cell populations that discharged in a pattern apparently related the behavioral CR, while other PC populations discharged in patterns that coincided with either presentation of the CS or US. Similar results were found by Berthier and Moore (1986) with single unit recording of PCs in lobule HVI. They found that populations of neurons fire in relation to various aspects of eyeblink training, including CS and US presentation and CR execution. (Berthier and Moore, 1986; Gould and Steinmetz, 1996). Recently, similar stimulus- and response-related PC activity has been found in ANT (Green and Steinmetz, 2005). Finally, electrophysiological recordings of PCs in HVI and ANT have revealed a difference in the overall population responses of PCs. The majority of PCs show excitatory patterns of activity during eyeblink conditioning in HVI (Berthier and Moore, 1986; Gould and Steinmetz, 1996; Katz and Steinmetz, 1997), and inhibitory patterns of activity in ANT (Green and Steinmetz, 2005). In a single unit recording study where the individual Purkinje cells were shown to be located in the area controlling blinks and to receive climbing <b>fibre</b> input on <b>US</b> presentations, only inhibitory responses were found. In a recent study of similarly characterized Purkinje cells which were followed for up to more than fifteen hours, it was found that repeated presentations of the CS and US caused the gradual development of a pause in Purkinje cell firing. This pause response, called a Purkinje cell CR, was also obtained when direct mossy fibre stimulation was used as the CS and direct climbing fibre stimulation as the US. Unpaired presentations of the CS and US caused extinction of the Purkinje cell CR. When paired presentations were reintroduced after extinction, Purkinje cell CRs reappeared rapidly, mirroring the [...] "savings" [...] phenomenon demonstrated at the behavioral level. Purkinje cell CRs were also adaptively timed.|$|R
40|$|The uncrossed retinofugal fibres in the {{marsupial}} Monodelphis domestica form {{a separate}} bundle {{as they pass}} through the optic chiasm. The uncrossed fibres segregate from the crossed fibres a short distance {{before they reach the}} chiasm, gathering as an essentially exclusive bundle in the ventral part of the optic nerve. This bundle then passes laterally through the optic chiasm and into the optic tract. The distinctive position of the uncrossed <b>fibres</b> has allowed <b>us</b> to recognise that, surprisingly, the uncrossed fibres degenerate more rapidly than the rest. Seven days after a monocular enucleation approximately 60 - 80 % of the fibres of the crossed component in {{the main part of the}} optic nerve near the chiasm have a normal cross sectional appearance in electron micrographs whereas less than 20 % of the fibres in the uncrossed bundle look normal. The rapid degeneration of the uncrossed fibres cannot be related to any morphological parameter of the axons. Their fibre diameters are mainly medium to thick, lying within the range of axon diameters found in the rest of the nerve. The axon-myelin ratios of the uncrossed fibres are also no different from those of the crossed optic fibres. There are no structural peculiarities identifiable with light or electron microscopical methods in either the axons or in the glia of the uncrossed bundle that might account for the more rapid degeneration. There is evidence that the degenerative change in the main part of the optic nerve progresses from the lesion towards the chiasm, and that for the crossed fibres it may progress slightly faster for the thicker than for the thinner fibres. The degeneration in the uncrossed bundle does not fit any of the rules that have been proposed for relating rate of degeneration to fibre diameter. We conclude that the rate of Wallerian degeneration is determined by factors that yet remain to be defined...|$|R
