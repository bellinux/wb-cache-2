5000|$|Presently, {{there are}} two types of world expositions: {{registered}} and recognized (sometimes unofficially known as [...] "major" [...] and [...] "minor" [...] fairs, respectively). <b>Registered</b> <b>exhibitions</b> are the biggest category events. Previously, registered expositions were called [...] "Universal Expositions". Even though this name lingers on in public memory, it is no longer in use as an official term. At <b>registered</b> <b>exhibitions,</b> participants generally build their own pavilions. They are therefore the most extravagant and most expensive expos. Their duration may be between six weeks and six months. Since 1995, the interval between two registered expositions has been at least five years. The latest registered exposition Expo 2015 was held in Milan, Italy, from May 1 to October 31, 2015.|$|R
