When <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> through the earth {{by means of the}} Artesian ray I reach a certain depth and then I see a void; when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> through a perfectly open passage to the same depth, I still see a void." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "See!" [...] he said. [...] "What I {{have found}} is nothing; even a camera shows nothing, and when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> {{through the glass}} I see nothing. It is just what the Artesian ray showed me; it is nothing at all!" ...|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> {{and there}} was the ugly face of Hans wearing a grin that might have frightened the man in the moon.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down.</b> The blighter was a {{blaze of}} mauve from the ankle-bone southward. I don't know when I've seen {{anything}} so dressy.|$|R
60|$|Then {{there are}} times when I love to gallop through history on Sir Walter's broomstick. At other hours it is {{pleasant}} to sit in converse with wise George Eliot. From her garden terrace <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> on Loamshire and its commonplace people; while in her quiet, deep voice she tells me of the hidden hearts that beat and throb beneath these velveteen jackets and lace falls.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{see nothing}} at all," [...] said Robin, {{stretching}} his head cautiously forward and gazing down into darkness profound, while he held on tight to a rail. [...] "How curious!--when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> {{everything in this}} wonderful ship {{seems to have no}} bottom, and when I look up, nothing appears to have any top, while, if I look backward or forward things seem to have no end! Ah! I see something now. Coming in from the light prevented me at first. Why, it's like a huge circus!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why," [...] {{replied the}} child, [...] "I often {{come here to}} sail little boats in the fountain, and to gather pretty pebbles out of its basin. And sometimes, when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> into the water, I see {{the image of the}} winged horse, in the picture of the sky that is there. I wish he would come down, and take me on his back, and let me ride him up to the moon! But, if I so much as stir to look at him, he flies far away out of sight." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> {{into his}} flushed face. His lips were shaking, {{and his eyes}} were fixed anxiously upon mine. I was miserably ashamed and unhappy.|$|R

6000|$|Staniford laughed again. [...] "I see {{you have}} not {{converted}} Lurella. Well, I like that in her, too. I wish I could have the arguments, pro and con. It would have been amusing. I suppose," [...] he pondered aloud, [...] "that she is a Calvinist of the deepest dye, and would regard me as a lost spirit for being outside of her church. She would look down upon me from one height, as <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> upon her from another. And really, as far as personal satisfaction in superiority goes, she might {{have the advantage of}} me. That's very curious, very interesting." ...|$|E
60|$|A blank, {{through which}} the warriors of poetry and history march on in stately hosts {{that seem to have}} no end--and what comes next! I am the head-boy, now! <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> on the line of boys below me, with a condescending {{interest}} in such of them as bring to my mind the boy I was myself, when I first came there. That little fellow seems to be no part of me; I remember him as something left behind upon the road of life--as something I have passed, rather than have actually been--and almost think of him as of someone else.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{brought into}} my head, master," [...] returns the woman, her eyes filling with tears, [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> {{at the child}} lying so. If it was never to wake no more, you'd think me mad, I should take on so. I know that very well. I was with Jenny when she lost hers--warn't I, Jenny?--and I know how she grieved. But look around you at this place. Look at them," [...] glancing at the {{sleepers}} on the ground. [...] "Look at the boy you're waiting for, who's gone out to do me a good turn. Think of the children that your business lays with often and often, and that YOU see grow up!" ...|$|E
60|$|I stood, {{uncertain}} {{how to take}} my leave. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> the street, shuffled my feet, {{looked back}} again--and felt my hair rise. The old man had disappeared.|$|R
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> at {{the little}} factor, I could see that his face was flushed and that he bore every {{appearance}} of having had an extra glass.|$|R
60|$|Blinded, I made a step. My foot struck {{something}} hard, and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> {{to discover}} my revolver, a blue-black thing, {{like a dead}} snake at my feet.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{a little}} black ball {{in the middle of}} your eye; I should see myself in it no bigger than that," [...] and she marked off about an eighth of her little fingernail. [...] "There is a pool in the wood, and <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> and see myself there. That is better. Just as large as I am--not small and black like a small, small fly." [...] And after saying th{{is a little}} disdainfully, she moved away from my side and out into the sunshine; and then, half turning towards me, and glancing first at my face and then upwards, she raised her hand to call my {{attention}} to something there.|$|E
6000|$|... 11. Perhaps, however, {{you think}} poppies {{in general are}} not much like cups. But the flower in my hand is a--poverty-stricken poppy, I was going to write,--poverty-strengthened poppy, I mean. On richer ground, it would have gushed into flaunting breadth of untenable purple--flapped its {{inconsistent}} scarlet vaguely to the wind--dropped the pride of its petals over my hand in an hour after I gathered it. But this little rough-bred thing, a Campagna pony of a poppy, is as bright and strong to-day as yesterday. So that I can see exactly where the leaves join or lap over each other; and when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> into the cup, find it to be composed of four leaves altogether,--two smaller, set within two larger. {72} ...|$|E
60|$|From the churchyard, <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> the ravine, on fine days, {{towards the}} sea. Mighty piles of granite soar above the fishermen's cottages on each side; the little strip of white beach which the cliffs shut in, glows pure in the sunlight; the inland stream that trickles down {{the bed of}} the rocks, sparkles, at places, like a rivulet of silver-fire; the round white clouds, with their violet shadows and bright wavy edges, roll on majestically above me; the cries of the sea-birds, the endless, dirging murmur of the surf, and the far music of the wind among the ocean caverns, fall, now together, now {{separately}} on my ear. Nature's voice and Nature's beauty--God's soothing and purifying angels of the soul--speak to me most tenderly and most happily, at such times as these.|$|E
60|$|He had a {{particular}} delight in boys, and an excellent way with them. I remember his once asking me with fantastic gravity, {{when he had been}} to Eton where my eldest son then was, whether I felt as he did in regard of never seeing a boy without wanting instantly to give him a sovereign? I thought of this when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> into his grave, after he was laid there, for <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> into it over the shoulder of a boy to whom he had been kind.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked up}} at me without replying, and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> at him without {{pressing}} him too soon with a repetition of my idle question. Just then there came a vague vibration in the earth and air, quickly changing into a violent pulsation, and an oncoming rush that caused me to start back, as though it had force to draw me down. When such vapour as rose to my height from this rapid train had passed me, and was skimming away over the landscape, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> again, and saw him refurling the flag he had shown while the train went by.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> at him compassionately, {{for he was}} old {{and broken}} in spirit, and would plainly starve if turned adrift on the prairie, while as I did so the {{surveyor}} broke in: ...|$|R
60|$|We are {{now making}} {{preparations}} for our departure, which we expect {{will take place}} on Tuesday; and yesterday I went to our Minister's to arrange about the passport. The very moment I rang at his door, it swung open, and the porter ushered me with great courtesy into the anteroom; not that he knew me, or anything about me, except that I was an American citizen. This is the deference which an American servant of the public finds it expedient to show to his sovereigns. Thank Heaven, I am a sovereign again, and no longer a servant; and really it is very singular how <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> upon our ambassadors and dignitaries of all sorts, not excepting the President himself. I doubt whether this is altogether a good influence of our mode of government.|$|E
6000|$|On this {{particular}} occasion, {{as he reached}} the Frenchman's plot, Tu-Kila-Kila stepped forward across the white taboo-line with a suspicious and peering eye. [...] "The King of the Rain has been here," [...] he said, in a pompous tone, as the Frenchman rose and saluted him ceremoniously. [...] "Tu-Kila-Kila's eyes are sharp. They never sleep. The sun is his sight. He beholds all things. You cannot hide aught in heaven or earth from the knowledge of him that dwells in heaven. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> upon land and sea, and spy out all that takes place or is planned in them. I am very holy and very cruel. I see all earth and I drink the blood of all men. The King of the Rain has come this morning to visit the King of the Birds. Where is he now? What has your divinity done with him?" ...|$|E
