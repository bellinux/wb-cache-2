In this context, request allocation is critical for the efficient system's operation. However, most methods used in <b>distributed</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> aim at maximizing overall system performance (throughput and response times) by allocating requests to the most efficient providers, without considering providers' autonomy. In this paper, we propose a balanced request allocation method, KnBest, which considers providers' autonomy in addition to load balancing. Our method is general and simple, {{so that it can}} be easily incorporated in existing <b>distributed</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems.</b> We describe the implementation of KnBest in different scenarios.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{we have seen a}} {{tremendous}} development of <b>distributed</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems,</b> both in terms of scale, as well as in terms of the types of <b>distributed</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems,</b> where classical approaches such as distributed and federated databases are complemented with Peer-to-Peer and Grid technology. When building such <b>distributed</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems,</b> we are faced with three typical challenging characteristics: (1) the heterogeneity of nodes, i. e. discrepancies in the way the data is modeled and represented, (2) dynamics, i. e. changes {{in the structure of the}} system as well as changes in the information at the individual nodes, and (3) autonomy, i. e. the ability of nodes to take decisions independently, which poses additional requirements on the coordination models to achieve scalability. In this thesis we will show how semantic technologies – and in particular the use of ontologies – can be employed to address these three challenges: First, we illustrate how ontologies with their well-de ned semantics allow to interpret the data consistently across nodes and to describe mappings for heterogeneous models and thus provide the means for information integration. Second, we show how ontology evolution allows us to deal with changes in the informatio...|$|R
