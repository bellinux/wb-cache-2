40|$|Abstract. Few {{attempts}} have been made to experimentally address the extent to which temporal or spatial variation in food availability influences avian habitat use. We used an experimental approach to investigate whether bird use differed between treated (arthropods reduced through insecticide application) and control (untreated) forest canopy gaps within a bottomland hardwood forest in the Upper Coastal Plain of South Carolina, USA. Gaps were two- to three-year-old group selection timber harvest openings of three sizes (0. 13, 0. 26, and 0. 50 ha). Our study was conducted during four bird use periods (spring migration, breeding, post-breeding, and fall migration) in 2002 and 2003. Arthropods were reduced <b>in</b> <b>treated</b> gaps by 68 % in 2002 and 73 % in 2003. We used mist-netting captures and foraging attack rates to assess the influence of arthropod abundance on avian habitat use. Evidence that birds responded to arthropod abundance was limited and inconsistent. In 2002, we generally captured more birds <b>in</b> <b>treated</b> gaps of the smallest size (0. 13 ha) and fewer birds <b>in</b> <b>treated</b> gaps of the larger sizes. In 2003, we recorded few differences in the number of captures <b>in</b> <b>treated</b> and control gaps. Foraging attack rates generally were lower <b>in</b> <b>treated</b> than <b>in</b> control gaps, indicating that birds were able to adapt to the reduced food availability and remain <b>in</b> <b>treated</b> gaps. We conclude that arthropod abundance was not a proximate factor controlling whether forest birds used our gaps. The abundance of food resources may not be as important in determining avian habitat selection as previous research has indicated, at least for passerines in temperate subtropical regions...|$|R
40|$|The reuse of treated {{wastewater}} for aquaculture {{has been}} practiced {{in several countries}} and has a potential to create a viable fish farming business in low income countries. However, wastewater aquaculture practices which satisfy health and hygiene guidelines and standards will not be viable if consumers are unwilling to purchase fish reared <b>in</b> <b>treated</b> wastewater. <b>In</b> this study we investigate consumers’ preference and willingness to pay for fish farmed <b>in</b> <b>treated</b> wastewater <b>in</b> Ghana. A consumer survey was conducted in Kumasi. We utilize a dichotomous-choice contingent valuation methodology to estimate willingness to pay for fresh Tilapia and smoked Catfish farmed <b>in</b> <b>treated</b> wastewater and analyze factors that affect consumer choice. Consumers in the survey ranked price, size and quality of fish measured by taste and freshness {{as the most important}} product attributes influencing their decision prior to purchasing fish. Source of fish is among the least important product attributes influencing consumers’ decision. Results indicate that surveyed consumers generally accept fish reared <b>in</b> <b>treated</b> wastewater if lower prices are offered. Socioeconomic factors such as household income, education and family size significantly determine consumers’ willingness to pay. Furthermore, results indicate that households with children are more likely to pay for smoked Catfish compared to fresh Tilapia indicating that postharvest processing of fish might be perceived as safer and thus increases consumers’ willingness to pay for smoked Catfish. The results of this study provide better understanding of fish consumers’ buying behavior and their perceptions of and attitude towards fish reared <b>in</b> <b>treated</b> wastewater. Moreover, results can contribute to identifying key product attributes that need to be targeted for improvement if sales of fish farmed <b>in</b> <b>treated</b> wastewater is to be achieved...|$|R
