In this feminist work of art, female silicon bodies were burnt in the Venetian lagoon, evoking the imagary of mythical phoenixes. When asked for the resemblance between the naming of her record Rising and this piece, Ono responded: [...] "Rising was telling all people {{that it is time}} for us to rise and fight for our rights. But in the process of fighting together, women are still being treated separately in an inhuman way. It weakens the power of men and women all together. I hope Arising will wake up Women Power, and make us, men and women, heal together." ...|$|R

40|$|The main aim of {{dissertation}} is {{to reveal}} and re-evaluate canonical and new narratives and links of Eastern and Western cultures which influenced Čiurlionis’ art, and {{to present it}} {{in a context of}} cultural and philosophical ideas of Europe in the turn of the 20 th century. The dissertation is composed of an introduction, six main parts, conclusions, a bibliography, and an appendix. The introduction is dedicated to an overview of the large panorama of literature and to summarize previous research done on the contextuality of Čiurlionis during the last century. Each of the six parts presents new links and contexts of Čiurlionis’ creative heritage related to <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>centres</b> – Warsaw, Leipzig, Vilnius, and St. Petersburg. Geographical places were selected as the best way to reveal different aspects of the influence of West and East cultures on the formation of Čiurlionis’ artistic language. Conclusions summarize research done in previous parts, and the appendix includes main materials used in research – copies of manuscripts and reproductions of paintings...|$|R
40|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the press in Serbia {{underwent}} a substantial change and began to reflect cultural trends in society. Delo, defined as a magazine for science, literature and social life, attracted a wide circle of contributors, intellectuals with different outlooks and views. Its editors and contributors, mostly educated and trained in <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>centres,</b> contributed to the creation of a climate conducive to the modernization of Serbian culture. This paper focuses on the role of French cultural and literary trends launched in the Delo, whose editors and contributors closely followed the leading French journals, translating and publishing the texts they deemed important for Serbia’s cultural development. French literature offered guidelines and models to the realist and naturalist movements, subsequently also to modernist and avantgarde tendencies in Serbian literature. The start of the journal in 1894 is associated with the Radical Party, but the Radical ideological influence on the journal was not as strong as might be expected. Choosing science, literature and social life as the journal’s areas of interest the founders and editors demonstrated their commitment to modernizing the young Serbian state and society by way of culture...|$|R

This article reveals that, on the contrary, {{for two and a}} half decades following the Holocaust Yiddish culture was in dynamic flux. Yiddish writers and cultural organisations maintained a staggering level of activity in fostering publications and performances, collecting archival and historical materials, and launching young literary talents. This article provides a cultural historical map of a Yiddish transnational network that derived its unity from the common purpose of commemorating and bearing witness to the destruction of the Jewish heartland in Central and Eastern Europe...|$|R

50|$|In 1987 the {{foundations}} of 19 houses on {{what used to be}} called the Judengasse were discovered during construction work on an administrative building. The Frankfurt Judengasse was the first Jewish ghetto in Europe. It was founded in 1460 and developed into an important <b>European</b> Jewish <b>cultural</b> <b>centre.</b> The archaeological finds gave rise to a controversial debate as to how these witnesses of Jewish history in Frankfurt should be handled. The conflict resulted in a compromise: five of the unearthed house foundations were dismantled and reconstructed at the cellar level of the new administration building. In 1992 the Museum Judengasse was then opened among these ruins, as it were. The presentation there centres on the history and culture of Frankfurt’s Jews from the Middle Ages to Jewish Emancipation. The Museum Judengasse borders both on a memorial site for the Frankfurt Jews murdered during the National Socialist era and on the second oldest Jewish cemetery in Germany. In 2016 the museum was reopened after reconstruction with a re-designed exhibition.|$|R
