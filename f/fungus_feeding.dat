50|$|Conocybe rickenii is a {{mushroom}} from the genus Conocybe.

50|$|Their {{societies}} {{are based on}} an ant-fungus mutualism, and different species of ants use different species of fungus, {{but all of the}} fungi the ants use are members of the family Lepiotaceae. The ants actively cultivate their <b>fungus,</b> <b>feeding</b> it with freshly cut plant material and keeping it free from pests and molds. This mutualistic relationship is further augmented by another symbiotic partner, a bacterium that grows on the ants and secretes chemicals; essentially, the ants use portable antimicrobials. Leaf cutter ants are sensitive enough to adapt to the fungi's reaction to different plant material, apparently detecting chemical signals from the fungus. If a particular type of leaf is toxic to the fungus, the colony will no longer collect it. The only two other groups of insects to use fungus-based agriculture are ambrosia beetles and termites. The fungus cultivated by the adults is used to feed the ant larvae, and the adult ants feed on leaf sap. The fungus needs the ants to stay alive, and the larvae need the fungus to stay alive, so the mutualism is obligatory.|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of climate change, the effects of {{prolonged}} or more severe droughts on pest and pathogen damage are a major concern for forest ecosystems. To date, there is great uncertainty about the direction, magnitude and sources of variation in responses to drought by insects and fungi. We report the outcomes of a meta-analysis of 100 pairwise comparisons of insect pest or pathogen damage to water-stressed and control trees from 40 publications. The type of feeding substrate for insects and fungi and the water stress severity emerged as the main factors influencing the level of damage in water-stressed trees. Overall, primary damaging agents living in wood caused significantly lower damage to the water-stressed trees compared with the control, whereas primary pests and pathogens living on foliage caused more damage to water-stressed trees, in all cases irrespective of stress severity. In contrast, damage by secondary agents increased with stress severity, which was best estimated by the ratio between the predawn leaf water potential in stressed trees and the xylem pressure inducing 50 % loss in hydraulic conductance due to cavitation, a species-specific index of drought tolerance. Insect and <b>fungus</b> <b>feeding</b> behaviour, affected tree part, and water stress severity are therefore proposed as three important predictors of forest damage in drought conditions. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|E

50|$|Most {{living things}} in soils, {{including}} plants, insects, bacteria, and fungi, {{are dependent on}} organic matter for nutrients and/or energy.

50|$|Agaritine (1) {{was long}} thought by {{biologists}} to emanate from shikimate (4), with the glutamate moiety clearly originating from glutamic acid.This assumption was made purely by inference: a similar compound, γ-glutaminyl-4-hydroxybenzene (5) {{is produced in}} the fruiting body of mushrooms in the genus Agaricus with similar abundance to agaritine and {{has been shown to}} be derived from the shikimate biosynthetic pathway. Recent work, however, has uncovered several problems with this hypothesis, of which inconsistencies in radiolabeling experiments are most notable.
