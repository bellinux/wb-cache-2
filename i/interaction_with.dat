40|$|Although we {{interact}} {{with a wide}} network of people on a daily basis, the social psychology literature has primarily focused on <b>interactions</b> <b>with</b> close friends and family. The present research tested whether subjective well-being is related not only to <b>interactions</b> <b>with</b> these strong ties but also to <b>interactions</b> <b>with</b> weak social ties (i. e., acquaintances). In Study 1, students experienced greater happiness and greater feelings of belonging on days when they interacted with more classmates than usual. Broadening the scope in Studies 2 A and 2 B to include all daily <b>interactions</b> (<b>with</b> both strong and weak ties), we again found that weak ties are related to social and emotional well-being. The current results highlight the power of weak ties, suggesting that even social <b>interactions</b> <b>with</b> the more peripheral members of our social networks contribute to our well-being. © 2014 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc...|$|R

Participants included 33 anxious children, their parents and siblings, and 14 nonclinic children and their parents. Parent-child interactions were observed during two discussion tasks related to anxiety-provoking or challenging situations. Parent-child interactions were coded for the following variables: control, warmth, reward of coping behaviour and task involvement. Consistent with previous research, parents in the anxious group showed more control, less paternal warmth and less maternal reward of coping behaviour toward their anxious child compared to parents of nonclinic children. Parent-child <b>interactions</b> <b>with</b> the anxious child were similar to parent-child <b>interactions</b> <b>with</b> the nonsymptomatic sibling, {{with the exception of}} fathers who exhibited more control toward their anxious child. Parent-sibling interactions, however, also resembled the nonclinic parent-child <b>interactions,</b> <b>with</b> mothers of anxious children showing more control toward their nonsymptomatic child than mothers of nonclinic children. These findings suggest that the relationships of each parent and their anxious child may be influenced by how the parent and child interact with each other.

Subjects. 36 elderly people with dementia (19 men and 17 women); 37 care staff (30 women and 7 men). Measures. The Quality of Interactions Schedule (QUIS). Results. Male residents initiated significantly more <b>interactions</b> <b>with</b> staff than female residents. Men did not initiate <b>interactions</b> <b>with</b> female staff significantly more often than with male staff. Women did not initiate any <b>interactions</b> <b>with</b> male staff. Female staff initiated more <b>interactions</b> <b>with</b> residents than did male staff.
