5000|$|Particularly, {{valley and}} glacis {{are exposed to}} higher {{agriculture}} pressure and the trend is to the <b>extensification</b> of croplands. This happens in three ways: the first one, by restoration of degraded lands; the second is by reclamation of grasslands {{and the last one}} by clearing of woody vegetation. The first method, supported by the PDR-ADM, concerns the slopes of the Keita valley and also the sandy dunes of the eastern plateaux. Land reclamation of grasslands has been pushed by demographic pressure especially in the Keita and Insafari valleys. Woody vegetation clearing happens especially in the secondary valleys where demographic pressure was low before 1984 and strongly increased later. On the other hand, woody vegetation restoration interests large areas on the slopes and also in the valleys as gallery forests. This trend on the slopes is particularly interesting where it is not directly due to Project interventions (plantation in trenches), because it shows the effectiveness of the watershed approach and the water management on plateaux and slopes.|$|E

The research concentrates on land-use changes resulting from the <b>extensification</b> of agriculture (especially grassing-over and abandonment of agricultural land) in last twenty years. Emphasis is put on an analysis of driving forces of <b>extensification</b> processes that have an influence on land-use change. Factors with an impact on <b>extensification</b> are divided into natural and socio-economic ones. Natural factors are represented for example by air temperature, precipitation, altitude, slope, or soil productivity. As socio-economic ones we consider for instance the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union, Gross Domestic Product, population density, spatial exposedness, or patterns of use and ownership of agricultural land. These factors are studied on European, Czech and local scales.

Even after 12 years of extensifi-cation there was only little evidence for the recovery or recolonisation of former hay meadow insect communities.

40|$|Extensive or {{low-input farming}} is {{considered}} a way of remedying many problems associated with intensive farming practices. But do extensive farming systems really result in a clear reduction in environmental impacts, especially if their lower productivity is taken into account? This question is studied for Swiss arable cropping and forage production systems in a comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) study. Three long-term experiments (DOC experiment comparing bio-dynamic, bio-organic and conventional farming, the "Burgrain" experiment including integrated intensive, integrated extensive and organic systems and the "Oberacker" experiment with conventional ploughing and no-till soil cultivation, are considered in the LCA study. Furthermore, model systems for arable crops and forage production for feeding livestock are investigated by using the Swiss Agricultural Life Cycle Assessment method (SALCA). The analysis covers an overall <b>extensification</b> of cropping systems and forage production {{on the one hand}} and a partial <b>extensification</b> of fertiliser use, plant protection and soil cultivation on the other. The overall <b>extensification</b> of an intensively managed system reduced environmental impacts in general, both per area unit and per product unit. In arable cropping systems medium production intensity gave the best results for the environment, and the intensity should not fall below the environmental optimum in order to avoid a deterioration of eco-efficiency. In grassland systems, on the contrary, a combination of both intensively and extensively managed plots was preferable to medium intensity practices on the whole area. The differences in yield, production intensity and environmental impact were much more pronounced in grassland than in arable cropping systems. Partial <b>extensification</b> of a farming system should be conceived in the context of the whole system in order to be successful. For example, the <b>extensification</b> solely of fertiliser use and soil cultivation resulted in a general improvement in the environmental performance of the farming system, whereas a reduction in plant protection intensity by banning certain pesticide categories reduced negative impacts on ecotoxicity and biodiversity only, while increasing other burdens such as global warming, ozone formation, eutrophication and acidification per product unit. The replacement of mineral fertilisers by farmyard manure as a special form of <b>extensification</b> reduced resource use and improved soil quality, while slightly increasing nutrient losses. These results show that a considerable environmental improvement potential exists in Swiss farming systems and that a detailed eco-efficiency analysis could help to target a further reduction in their environmental impacts.

40|$|Most global {{strategies}} for future food security focus on sustainable intensification of production {{of food and}} involve increased use of nitrogen fertilizer and manure. The external costs of current high nitrogen (N) losses from agriculture in the European Union, are 0. 3 – 1. 9 % {{of gross domestic product}} (GDP) in 2008. We explore the potential of sustainable <b>extensification</b> for agriculture in the EU and The Netherlands by analysing cases and scenario studies focusing on reducing N inputs and livestock densities. Benefits of <b>extensification</b> are higher local biodiversity and less environmental pollution and therefore less external costs for society. <b>Extensification</b> also has risks such as a reduction of yields and therewith a decrease of the GDP and farm income and a smaller contribution to the global food production, and potentially an i 0 ncrease of global demand for land. We demonstrate favourable examples of <b>extensification.</b> Reducing the N fertilization rate for winter wheat in Northwest Europe to 25 – 30 % below current N recommendations accounts for the external N cost, but requires action to compensate for a reduction in crop yield by 10 – 20 %. Dutch dairy and pig farmers changing to less intensive production maintain or even improve farm income by price premiums on their products, and/or by savings on external inputs. A scenario reducing the Dutch pig and poultry sector by 50 %, the dairy sector by 20 % and synthetic N fertilizer use by 40 % lowers annual N pollution costs by 0. 2 – 2. 2 billion euro (40 %). This benefit compensates for the loss of GDP in the primary sector but not in the supply and processing chain. A 2030 scenario for the EU 27 reducing consumption and production of animal products by 50 % (demitarean diet) reduces N pollution by 10 % and benefits human health. This diet allows the EU 27 to become a food exporter, while reducing land demand outside Europe in 2030 by more than 100 million hectares (2 %), which more than compensates increased land demand when changing to organic farming.

In the context of an assessment of the effect of national <b>extensification</b> programme on biodiversity in agriculture, field data of three regions (7 km 2 each) were collected according to a stratified sampling method. A distribution model of three taxa (spiders, carabid beetles, and butterflies) is related to influencing factors by means of multivariate statistics (canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), partial CCA). Hypothetical influencing factors are categorised as follows: (1) habitat (habitat type, plant species richness) and (2) landscape (habitat heterogeneity, variability, diversity, proportion of natural and semi-natural areas). The correlative model developed for the spider assemblages revealed that the most important local habitat factors are those directly influenced by management practices. Landscape variability, heterogeneity and diversity in the surroundings are not significant factors. Carabid beetle assemblages show a positive reaction to landscape features and respond to particular cultivated surroundings. The model developed for butterflies shows that species assemblages are sensitive to landscape features. Surrounding land use in particular, has a major influence. There are no general models relating overall species diversity to landscape diversity. The relationship strongly depends on the organism examined. Therefore, biodiversity response to landscape and habitat changes (e. g. the <b>extensification</b> programme) has to be identified by means of multi-taxon concept. © 2003 Elsevier Science B. V.

Farms were based on available accountancy data and surveyed production data, while information on farm location within the district was derived from a spatial allocation procedure. The reduction in total gross margin per unit area was used to measure on-farm compliance costs. A dimensionless environmental index was used to assess the suitability of the scheme {{to reduce the risk of}} nitrate-leaching. Calculated on-farm compliance costs and environmental effects were heterogeneous in space and farm types as a result of different agricultural production and site characteristics. On-farm costs ranged from zero up to almost 1500 Â Euro/ha. Such high costs occurred only in a very small part of the regional area, whereas the majority of the grassland had low on-farm costs below 50 Â Euro/ha. Environmental effects were moderate and greater on high-yield than on low-yield grassland. The low effectiveness combined with low on-farm costs in large parts of the region indicates that the scheme is not well targeted.

Collectively, intensification has contributed to GEC particularly through changes to the nitrogen cycle and increasing atmospheric concentrations of gases contributing to global warming. The environmental consequences of the increased production may occur either on- or off-site or both, and will vary regionally depending on whether intensification or <b>extensification</b> is the main pathway for achieving the increases. Changes in extremes of weather associated with increased climate variability in the short term, and in mean values of temperature and rainfall associated with climate change in the long term, contribute to th...|$|E
40|$|Downfall of {{communist}} regime from 1989 brought fundamental {{changes to the}} political, social and economic system in post-socialist countries and influenced changes in landscape and its structure. The objective of this thesis was comparison of landscape structure changes in Czech Republic and Slovakia after 1990 by means of chosen spatial indices and identify key processes leading to changes of land cover. CORINE Land Cover database was used to derive landscape changes in the period 1990 - 2000 in Czech republic and Slovakia. According to analysis, suburbanisation, <b>extensification</b> and intensification of agriculture as well as afforestation have been recognised {{as the most important}} processes in the study areas. Results demonstrated significant diferences in intensity of individual processes and their impact on landscape heterogeneity in both countries. In Slovakia, the most intense changes have been made by the processes of afforestation in mountain and submontane areas in the central and north part of the country. This led mostly to increase in landscape heterogeneity. Oppositely, the most intense processes of <b>extensification</b> of agriculture in border areas of Czech Republic led mainly to spatial homogenization of landscape. Thus, results refer to various socioeconomic and natural factors which [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of the {{agreement}} of about 50 % reduction in pesticide uses according to the accords du “Grenelle de l’environnement” in France, the central part of this study involves the assessment of agricultural intensification (AI) and agricultural <b>extensification</b> (AE) processes in crop activities. This is done with reference to pesticide uses per ha thereby helping to proffer a solution to the lingering questions of farmers as regards the use of inputs in an intensified manner or otherwise. With respect to this, a sample of 600 farms in the Meuse department was observed over a 12 -year period. The analysis was essentially to assess cost efficiency dominance between the two technologies AE and AI using non parametric cost-functions which involves different characterizations of the reference set. This therefore helps to define the relative intensive and extensive technologies in terms of pesticide uses per ha, our empirical application therefore shows that AE process is a better option than AI not only for the society but also for the producers who could significantly reduce their operating costs. agricultural intensification (AI), agricultural <b>extensification</b> (AE), pesticide reduction, environmental performance, non parametric cost-functions, Environmental Economics and Policy, Farm Management,...|$|E
