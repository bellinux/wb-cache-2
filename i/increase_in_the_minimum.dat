During late 2015, the House and Senate, in rare bipartisan form, passed the largest infrastructure package in a decade, costing $305 billion over five years, less than the $478 billion in Obama's initial request.

40|$|The {{employment}} {{effect of}} <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> wage {{is one of}} the most studied topics in all of economics. This report examines the most recent wave of this research [...] roughly since 2000 [...] to determine the best current estimates of <b>the</b> impact of <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> wage on <b>the</b> employment prospects of low-wage workers. The weight of that evidence points to little or no employment response to modest <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> wage. <b>The</b> report reviews evidence on eleven possible adjustments to minimum-wage increases that may help to explain why the measured employment effects are so consistently small. The strongest evidence suggests that the most important channels of adjustment are: reductions in labor turnover; improvements in organizational efficiency; reductions in wages of higher earners ("wage compression"); and small price increases. Given the relatively small cost to employers of modest <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> wage, these adjustment mechanisms appear to be more than sufficient to avoid employment losses, even for employers with a large share of low-wage workers...|$|R

25|$|Brown et al. (1983) {{noted that}} time series studies {{to that point}} had found that for a 10 percent <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> wage, there was a {{decrease}} in teenage employment of 1–3 percent. However, the studies found wider variation, from 0 to over 3 percent, in their estimates for the effect on teenage unemployment (teenagers without a job and looking for one). In contrast to the simple supply and demand diagram, it was commonly found that teenagers withdrew from the labor force {{in response to the}} minimum wage, which produced the possibility of equal reductions in the supply as well as the demand for labor at a higher minimum wage and hence no impact on the unemployment rate. Using a variety of specifications of the employment and unemployment equations (using ordinary least squares vs. generalized least squares regression procedures, and linear vs. logarithmic specifications), they found that a 10 percent <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> wage caused a 1 percent decrease in teenage employment, and no change in the teenage unemployment rate. The study also found a small, but statistically significant, increase in unemployment for adults aged 20–24.|$|E
25|$|As {{governor}} of Massachusetts {{and as a}} candidate for president, Romney has called for tying raises in the national minimum wage to indicators of growth in the economy, such as increases in the inflation rate. He has said that increases in the minimum wage should be moderate and predictable. Commenting in March 2012 on a proposal put forward by some Democratic legislators to raise the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10 per hour, Romney said that an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> wage was probably not necessary at that time.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, {{the minimum}} wage in New Jersey {{increased}} from $4.25 to $5.05 per hour (an 18.8% increase), while in the adjacent state of Pennsylvania it remained at $4.25. David Card and Alan Krueger gathered information on fast food restaurants in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania {{in an attempt to}} see what effect this increase had on employment within New Jersey. A basic supply and demand model predicts that relative employment should have decreased in New Jersey. Card and Krueger surveyed employers before the April 1992 New Jersey increase, and again in November–December 1992, asking managers for data on the full-time equivalent staff level of their restaurants both times. Based on data from the employers' responses, the authors concluded that the <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> wage slightly increased employment in the New Jersey restaurants.|$|E

Allowances for the handicapped were also increased, while the right to deduct the cost of child care for all {{children under the age of}} three was introduced (a right later extended to include all children under the age of five in some cases). Unemployed workers ineligible for jobless benefits were given back the right to claim sickness insurance that they had lost in 1979 while the reimbursal of the costs of dental fees, hearing aids, and glasses was improved. An 80-franc-per-month charge that had been imposed on certain long-term illnesses was abrogated, and certain individuals who had retired before 1973 had the base upon which their pensions were calculated adjusted upward. Between 1981 and 1983, the minimum vieillesse (the basic pension benefit for the elderly poor) was raised by 62%.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} <b>the</b> {{impact of}} <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> drinking age on {{the prevalence of}} alcohol and marijuana consumption among high school seniors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. The empirical analysis {{is based on a}} large sample of students from 43 states over the years 1980 - 1989. We find that <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> drinking age did reduce the prevalence of alcohol consumption. We also find, however, that increased legal minimum drinking ages had the unintended consequence of increasing the prevalence of marijuana consumption. We estimate a model based on the canonical theory of the consumer. Estimates from this model suggest that this unintended consequence is attributable to standard substitution effects. The estimates of the structural model also suggest that an increased drinking age helps create a climate of societal disapproval for all drug use, not only alcohol. We find that holding the consumption of alcohol constant, an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> drinking age reduces the prevalence of marijuana consumption. This effect is not large enough, however, to offset the large substitution toward marijuana induced by the decreased prevalence of alcohol consumption. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{econometric model}} for the {{wholesale}} and ex-vessel markets of American lobster, Homarus amedcanus, was developed to determine the market impact of proposed <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> size for American lobster. Prices {{were found to be}} inflexible with respect to landing, imports, and income (i. e., the price flexibilities were less than one) in both wholesale and ex-vessel markets. The size of lobster has a statistically significant effect on wholesale and ex-vessel prices and revenues. On average, wholesalers pass along 52 % of any price changes to lobstermen. The ex-vessel price impact of a given change in supply is about the same as for changes in either landings or imports. Any changes in public policies leading to <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> total landings of American lobster and/or decreases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> proportion of small lobsters <b>in</b> <b>the</b> landings would result <b>in</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> gross revenues to fishermen and wholesalers.

500|$|In 1996, Kennedy secured an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> wage law, {{which was}} one of his {{favorite}} issues; there would not be another increase for ten years. [...] Following the failure of the Clinton health care plan, Kennedy went against his past strategy and sought incremental measures instead. Kennedy worked with Republican Senator Nancy Kassebaum to create and pass the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act in 1996, which set new marks for portability of insurance and confidentiality of records. The same year, Kennedy's Mental Health Parity Act forced insurance companies to treat mental health payments the same as others with respect to limits reached. In 1997, Kennedy was the prime mover behind the State Children's Health Insurance Program, which used increased tobacco taxes to fund the largest expansion of taxpayer-funded health insurance coverage for children in the U.S. since Medicaid began in the 1960s.
