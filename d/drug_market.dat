5|$|The Cartman <b>drug</b> <b>market</b> subplot {{was heavily}} {{influenced}} by the 1983 crime film Scarface, with Cartman resembling fictional drug lord Tony Montana and KFC founder Colonel Sanders as antagonist Alejandro Sosa. The episode also included several jokes about Pope Benedict XVI and the child sexual abuse scandals that had been surrounding the Catholic Church at the time. The concept of a former KFC restaurant becoming a marijuana dispensary came from a news story about a real marijuana dispensary in Palms, Los Angeles, built at a site formerly housing a Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise.|$|E

25|$|In the 1950s, a {{crackdown}} in the United States on drug trafficking {{led to the}} imprisonment of many American mafiosi. Furthermore, Cuba, a major hub for drug smuggling, fell to Fidel Castro. This prompted American mafia boss Joseph Bonanno to return to Sicily in 1957 to franchise out his heroin operations to the Sicilian clans. Anticipating rivalries for the lucrative American <b>drug</b> <b>market,</b> he negotiated {{the establishment of a}} Sicilian Mafia Commission to mediate disputes.|$|E
25|$|Although Mexican drug cartels, or drug {{trafficking}} organizations, have existed for several decades, their influence has increased since {{the demise of}} the Colombian Cali and Medellín cartels in the 1990s. Mexican drug cartels now dominate the wholesale illicit <b>drug</b> <b>market</b> and in 2007 controlled 90% of the cocaine entering the United States. Arrests of key cartel leaders, particularly in the Tijuana and Gulf cartels, has led to increasing drug violence as cartels fight for control of the trafficking routes into the United States.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{intelligence}} agencies have accused LTTE {{of involvement in}} drug trafficking. In 2010, citing Royal Canadian Mounted Police sources, Jane's Intelligence Review said the LTTE controls {{a portion of the}} one billion dollar <b>drug</b> <b>market</b> in Montreal. It also states narcotics smuggling using its merchant ships, {{is one of the main}} ways of earning money out of its $300 million annual income. The U.S. Department of Justice states that LTTE has historically served as the drug couriers moving narcotics into Europe. Indian authorities accused LTTE operatives of previously bringing narcotics to Mumbai from Mandsaur District of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Punjab border. The drugs were then transported to coastal towns in Tamil Nadu such as Tuticorin, Rameswaram, Ramanathapuram, Nagapattinam and Kochi, in Kerala State.|$|E

25|$|Market size can {{be given}} {{in terms of the}} number of buyers and sellers in a {{particular}} market or in terms of the total exchange of money in the market, generally annually (per year). When given in terms of money, market size is often termed market value, but in a sense distinct from market value of individual products. For one and the same goods, there may be different (and generally increasing) market values at the production level, the wholesale level and the retail level. For example, the value of the global illicit <b>drug</b> <b>market</b> for the year 2003 was estimated by the United Nations to be US$13 billion at the production level, $94 billion at the wholesale level (taking seizures into account), and US$322 billion at the retail level (based on retail prices and taking seizures and other losses into account).|$|E
25|$|Escobar {{was born}} in Rionegro, Colombia {{and grew up in}} nearby Medellín. He studied briefly at Universidad Autónoma Latinoamericana of Medellin but left without a degree; he began to engage in {{criminal}} activity that involved selling contraband cigarettes and fake lottery tickets, and he participated in motor vehicle theft. In the 1970s, he began to work for various contraband smugglers, often kidnapping and holding people for ransom before beginning to distribute powder cocaine himself, as well as establishing the first smuggling routes into the United States in 1975. His infiltration to the <b>drug</b> <b>market</b> of the U.S. expanded exponentially due to the rising demand for cocaine and, by the 1980s, it was estimated that 70 to 80 tons of cocaine were being shipped from Colombia to the U.S. on a monthly basis. His drug network was commonly known as the Medellín Cartel, which often competed with rival cartels domestically and abroad, resulting in massacres and the murders of police officers, judges, locals, and prominent politicians.|$|E
25|$|The {{downtown}} area, {{which was}} Claude Dubois’ target, was very profitable in the trafficking of marijuana, LSD, and particularly meth, which operated {{out of the}} hippie area of St. Henri Square as wanting {{to gain control of}} Saint-Louis Square which was run by the Devil’s Disciples. The Devil’s Disciples were purely French and were considered the most powerful biker gang at their time in Montreal. The Disciples had created a highly profitable drug trafficking business in the Saint-Louis Square, which was located in downtown Montreal in 1972 and almost instantly became the largest open-air <b>drug</b> <b>market</b> in Montreal. Claude Dubois considered this as a threat and intrusion into his and his Brothers territory and hired another muscle group of bikers called the Popeyes. Between 74 and 76 fifteen members of the Disciples were killed but the Dubois Brothers ended up succeeded taking over the territory and ran out the Devil’s Disciples, yet again displaying their power. The Popeyes then began selling and managing the drugs in Saint-Henri square and the surrounding area after they chased out the Disciples but this was short lived as the Montreal Police had assembled a well- organized task force to take on the Dubois Brothers.|$|E

[...] On September 29, 2004, he introduced H.R. 5155, the Free Market Drug Act; a system where the National Institutes of Health would fund research, thus disconnecting the manufacturing of drugs from research and increasing competition among private manufacturers.|$|E

2500|$|Many ecstasy users {{describe}} {{the potency of}} various ecstasy pills {{in terms of their}} stack such as double stack or triple stack pills. These claims are dubious as {{there is no way to}} verify potency objectively without proper testing. The term [...] "stack" [...] is not intended to measure potency of ecstasy pills, but it is used as a measurement of mass. Single stacks weigh in at 0.20grams, doubles at 0.40grams, and triples at 0.60grams. Furthermore, a high percentage of what is sold as [...] "ecstasy" [...] may contain a combination of MDMA and one or more other substances or may in fact contain no MDMA at all (see [...] "MDMA impurity" [...] above). For these reasons, the [...] "stack" [...] system of strength description is not necessarily trustworthy—as is commonly the case in the underground <b>drug</b> <b>market.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The Gulf Cartel is {{believed}} to have ties with the 'Ndrangheta, an organized crime group in Italy that also has ties with Los Zetas.

In 2009, the Gulf organization concluded that expanding their market opportunities in Europe, combined with the euro strength against the U.S. dollar, justified establishing an extensive network in that continent. The main areas of demand and drug consumption are in Eastern Europe, the successor states of the Soviet Union. In Western Europe, the primarily increase has been in the use of cocaine. Along with the market in the United States, the <b>drug</b> <b>market</b> in Europe is among the most lucrative in the world, where the Mexican drug cartels are believed to have deals with the mafia groups of Europe.|$|E

2500|$|Aside from {{coordinating}} {{drug trafficking}} shipments, Inzunza Inzunza {{was responsible for}} stopping incursions and fighting off rival drug trafficking organizations in Sonora. In particular, the drug lord commanded his forces against the Beltrán Leyva Cartel, which was undergoing a gradual resurgence. In early 2011, Inzunza Inzunza fled the area of Mexicali and relocated in Baja California after Manuel Torres Félix (alias [...] "The Crazy One") wanted him dead for the [...] "unapproved" [...] murder of Paulo Osorio Payán (alias [...] "El Pablo"), one of his associates. From his safe house in Tijuana, Baja California, the drug lord gave orders in Mexicali. When Torres Félix {{was killed in a}} gunfight with the Mexican Army in Sinaloa on October 2012, Inzunza Inzunza returned to Mexicali to help his business partner [...] "El Checo". Inzunza Inzunza's tenure in Mexicali was disrupted in 2012 by a group known as [...] "Los Garibay", which was controlled by José Manuel Garibay Félix (alias [...] "El Manuelón" [...] and/or [...] "El Gordo"), a drug trafficker from the Sinaloa Cartel who joined forces with the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) while serving prison time in Jalisco. The infighting resulted in multiple killings in Mexicali and the surrounding areas that year. On 23 February 2013, however, Mexican authorities discovered the corpse of Garibay Félix on a highway near Guadalajara, Jalisco. His body bore signs of torture and a bullet hole in the head, usual signs to distinguish common murders from killings committed by organized crime. His death caused the CJNG to break away from its loose connection with the Sinaloa Cartel and operate independently in Jalisco in efforts to fight the Sinaloans for the control of the <b>drug</b> <b>market</b> in the state.|$|E
2500|$|There {{was never}} any formal {{structure}} or hierarchy to the Dubois Brothers group, other than the Brothers were on the top, they either individually or in tandem with each other controlled a particular criminal activity or territory and often shared their army or other members. The Dubois Brothers began in the 1950s [...] with petty street crimes and eventually {{moved on to the}} four oldest brothers- Raymond, Jean-Guy, Normand and Claude- starting to convince local bar owners to give them protection funds and other extortions. Some of their petty street crimes were a series of burglaries and armed robberies in the early 1950s. [...] By the time the 1960s rolled around extortion, targeting the owners and employees of nightclubs, bars and taverns in the eastern end of the city became their specialty. Near the end of the 1960s five of the brothers were charged with murdering a waiter at a quarrel in a local bar, which ended with the waiter shot, they were later acquitted and continued their reign. Into the late 1960s to 70s, the Dubois Brothers expanded their territory into the downtown nightclubs as they challenged the Cotroni Mafia family supremacy. The Cotroni Family began to show signs of weakness around the 1970s allowing the expansion of the Dubois Brothers territory into both the east and west ends of Montreal city. This movement allowed the Brothers to basically wipe out the rival Irish gang as well and take over a lucrative <b>drug</b> <b>market</b> by out muscling a motorcycle gang. The Dubois Brothers were prospering in the 1970s and continued to expand their territory and add to their criminal lifestyle. One of the Commissioners in the 1977 report described the Dubois brothers as living, in [...] "opulence if we can judge by the external manifestations of wealth, such as town houses, country houses, expensive cars and an ostentatious life style." [...] The Dubois Brothers seemed to have it all.|$|E
