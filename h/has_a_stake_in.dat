In 1989, these diversified interests started growing into separate organizations. The fisheries project became Grameen Motsho ("Grameen Fisheries Foundation") and the irrigation project became Grameen Krishi ("Grameen Agriculture Foundation"). In time, the Grameen initiative {{grew into a}} multi-faceted group of profitable and non-profit ventures, including major projects like Grameen Trust and Grameen Fund, which runs equity projects like Grameen Software Limited, Grameen CyberNet Limited, and Grameen Knitwear Limited, as well as Grameen Telecom, which <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>stake</b> <b>in</b> Grameenphone (GP), the biggest private phone company in Bangladesh. From its start in March 1997 to 2007, GP's Village Phone (Polli Phone) project had brought cell-phone ownership to 260,000 rural poor in over 50,000 villages.|$|E

Time summed up Thrillers impact as a [...] "restoration of confidence" [...] for an industry bordering on [...] "the ruins of punk and the chic regions of synthesizer pop". The publication described Jackson's influence at that point as, [...] "Star of records, radio, rock video. A one-man rescue team for the music business. A songwriter who sets the beat for a decade. A dancer with the fanciest feet on the street. A singer who cuts across all boundaries of taste and style and color too".|$|E

2500|$|When the State Legislature met as a {{constitutional}} convention in June, observers anticipated a closer vote {{than the previous}} January because of retirements and some announced changes in position. Advocates of the amendment charged that the political pressure on legislators {{on the part of}} Governor Deval Patrick and legislative leaders included job offers and trading votes on other issues. Opponents of the amendment cast the vote as one of conscience and personal rather than political lobbying. The day before the convention, the state's four Roman Catholic bishops in a letter to legislators endorsed putting the issue to a popular vote: [...] "he marriage debate should not be reserved only to lawyers and lawmakers. Every citizen <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>stake</b> <b>in</b> the outcome, because every citizen <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>stake</b> <b>in</b> the well-being of the family." [...] Cardinal Sean P. O'Malley called several legislators to lobby for their votes and Governor Patrick said he offered some help in their re-election campaigns. On June 14, 2007, the convention opened and proceeded immediately to a vote on the issue without debate. The measure failed to obtain the required 50 votes, as 45 voted in favor, 151 opposed the measure, and four were absent or abstained from the vote. Two new legislators who were thought to support the amendment voted against it, while nine who had supported it in January, seven Democrats and two Republicans, changed their votes to oppose it. VoteOnMarriage.Org announced it would attempt to unseat legislators who had switched sides to defeat the amendment.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, UN geologists also {{discovered}} major uranium deposits and other rare mineral reserves in Somalia.

In 1984, the IUREP Orientation Phase Mission to Somalia reported that the country had 5,000 tons of uranium reasonably assured resources (RAR), 11,000 tons of uranium estimated additional resources (EAR) in calcrete deposits, as well as 0–150,000 tons of uranium speculative resources (SR) in sandstone and calcrete deposits.

The poor have been rebels, but they have never been anarchists; they have more interest than anyone else in there being some decent government. The poor man really <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>stake</b> <b>in</b> the country. The rich man hasn't; he can go away to New Guinea in a yacht. The poor have sometimes objected to being governed badly; the rich have always objected to being governed at all. Aristocrats were always anarchists, as you can see from the barons' wars." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then he besought Robin of Huntingdon, {{the jolly}} outlaw, nathless, to join him, {{and go to}} the help of their fair sire King Richard, with a score or two of lances. But the Earl of Huntingdon was a very {{different}} character from Robin Hood the forester. There was no more conscientious magistrate in all the county than his lordship: he was never known to miss church or quarter-sessions; he was the strictest game-proprietor in all the Riding, and sent scores of poachers to Botany Bay. [...] "A man who <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>stake</b> <b>in</b> the country, my good Sir Wilfrid," [...] Lord Huntingdon said, with rather a patronizing air (his lordship had grown immensely fat since the King had taken him into grace, and required a horse as strong as an elephant to mount him)--"a man with a stake in the country ought to stay IN the country. Property has its duties as well as its privileges, and a person of my rank is bound to live on the land from which he gets his living." ...|$|E
6000|$|This was {{his last}} visit to America {{for more than twenty}} years. He now {{subsided}} once more into the life of London, with its incessant round of sociability and its equally incessant accompaniment of creative work. Gradually his tone in regard to his English setting is modified and deepened. In the correspondence of these middle years it is no longer the interested but slightly rebellious immigrant who speaks; it is rather the old-established colonist, now identified with his surroundings, a sharer in the general fortunes and responsibilities of the place. If he still regards himself as an observer from without and is still capable, as he once says, of [...] "raging against British density in hours of irritation and disgust," [...] it is none the less noticeable that English difficulties, English wars and politics and social troubles, of all of which these years were very full, begin to affect him as matters that concern his pride and solicitude for the country. There mingles with his exasperation an ardent desire that the English race may continue to stand high in the world, in spite of the many voices prophesying decadence and disaster. He writes as one who now <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>stake</b> <b>in</b> an old and honourable institution, and who feels a personal interest in its well-being and its good fame. Not indeed that he took, or ever for a moment wished to take, any share in the common life of the place but that of the most private fellowship; he resolutely avoided the least appearance of publicity, always refused to be drawn into popular functions, organisations, associations of any sort, and clung more and more, {{in the midst of all}} distractions, to the secrecy and seclusion of his work. And for that inner life these years were a very important turning-point. He now reached a period of his development when an immensely enlarged world of art seemed to open before him; and at the same time he made the discovery--one that had a deep and special effect upon him--that he was not the kind of writer who is rewarded with a big audience. Both these matters are heard of in the letters of this time, but their consequences do not appear fully until somewhat later. They were various and far-reaching, and some of them can hardly be called fortunate.|$|E
