50|$|In the UK urban {{forestry}} was pioneered {{around the turn}} of the 19th century by the Midland reafforesting association, whose focus was in the Black Country. In the mid 1990s the National Urban <b>Forestry</b> <b>Unit</b> (NUFU) grew out of a Black Country Urban <b>Forestry</b> <b>Unit</b> and promoted {{urban forestry}} across the UK, notably including the establishment of the Black Country Urban Forest. As urban forestry become more mainstream in the 21st century, NUFU was wound up, and its advocacy role now carried on by organisations such as The Wildlife Trusts and the Woodland Trust.|$|E

During World War II a unit was formed known as the Newfoundland Overseas <b>Forestry</b> <b>Unit</b> (or NOFU) with about 3,680 men. Many Newfoundlanders stationed in Scotland in the NOFU worked on their education to be eligible for enlistment in the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy.|$|E

40|$|Lately, laser {{scanning}} even of huge areas has become economically sensible due to new airborne laser-scanners delivering higher resolutions and measurement frequency. In this paper we will describe {{a novel approach}} for single tree delineation based on airborne laser-scanner-data for use in forestry applications. This currently leads into the development a forestry management tool {{as a part of}} a new three-dimensional geoinformation system (3 D-GIS). By enhancing the well-known watershed-algorithm by adding a third dimension, we developed a novel volumetric approach, which is able to accurately — and robustly — detect positions and dimensions of the individual trees in a forest. Each tree’s “business card” is then stored in a database, the “Virtual Forest ” which serves as the integration platform for a new single-tree-based forestry management system currently being developed in Northrhine-Westfalia, Germany. Combining the single-tree-data with known statistical methods, the system will provide the user with a detailed view on <b>forestry</b> <b>units,</b> on single trees or on the complete forest within an administrative district. The presented algorithms and methods were integrated into our 3 D-GIS and successfully tested in a 82 km test-area close to Arnsberg, Germany. 1...|$|R

40|$|Today’s laser-scanners {{deliver a}} better {{resolution}} and a faster measurement frequency than ever before, making airborne scanning of huge areas more affordable. In this paper we describe {{how to improve}} the workflow in forestry management using the increased capability of today’s scanner-systems. Currently 2 D-GISs which are providing information about units containing {{a large number of}} trees are used in forest planning. The next generation 3 D-GISs may feature information about the single tree, supporting a more precise planning and a more efficient harvesting in the forest. We developed a new approach for single-tree delineation based on a volumetric analysis in laser-scanner data. The algorithm detects positions and dimensions of individual trees in a forest for use in a 3 D-GIS. The measured data can be combined with other measured and statistical data giving the user a detailed view in the <b>forestry</b> <b>units,</b> leading to a database consisting of individual trees – the so called “Virtual Forest”. The volumetric approach was adapted to use a combination of aerial photos and 3 D laser-scanner data. While positions were only taken from the better resolved true-ortho-photos dimensions and especially height-information are based on the 3 D-data. The volumetric approach was implemented into a 3 D-GIS and successfully tested using recorded data from a 82 km test-area. 1...|$|R

40|$|Forest game damage lead {{to serious}} {{conflicts}} between forest and game managers, both in Hungary and worldwide. For <b>forestry</b> <b>units</b> {{the most important}} source of incomes is the logging. However, ungulates can have serious local browsing pressure on reforestation sites by their normal feeding activities. According to foresters {{the only way for}} reducing that damage is the radical decrease of number of large herbivorous game species (mainly red deer) in the forests. But for game managers a suitable level of ungulate density is necessary to gain incomes from hunting. As a consequence there is no agreement about the ecologically and economically sustainable ungulate density and impact. To decrease this difficult contradiction we need scientific data about the real browsing effect of large herbivores on forest vegetation of different characteristics. In this study we investigated the available food supply and the browsing effect of ungulates on artificial and natural beech regeneration sites of different ages. Density of beech saplings and number of available and browsed sprouts of all woody species present were estimated. We found significantly more beech saplings and sprouts and also higher browsing impact on beech in the natural than in artifical sites. Although we did not reveal a clear linear correlation, the highest browsing values (more than 20...|$|R
50|$|A {{reorganization}} of the TNPD in 1978 and 1979 gave more command authority to the four police lieutenant generals who served as regional commissioners of the Provincial Police. Thereafter, the senior officers of each region not only controlled all provincial police assigned to their respective geographic areas but also directed the railroad, highway, marine, and <b>forestry</b> police <b>units</b> operating there, without going through {{the chain of command}} to the Central Investigation Bureau in Bangkok. Although this change increased the workload of the regional headquarters, it resulted in greater efficiency and improved law enforcement.|$|R
50|$|Altogether, some 35,000 Canadians {{served in}} the Forestry Corps—which {{eventually}} was composed of dozens of companies (each composed of several hundred workers). Although individual troops in emergency situations were sent to fight {{on the front lines}} the CFC usually served well back of the fighting. Occasionally, <b>Forestry</b> Corps <b>units</b> were employed as labour units for the Canadian Corps on the front lines with duties such as stockpiling artillery ammunition, assisting in the quick construction of rail and road systems in the wake of attacking troops, or in helping to evacuate the wounded.|$|R
50|$|Management {{challenges}} for urban forestry include maintaining {{a tree and}} planting site inventory, quantifying and maximizing the benefits of trees, minimizing costs, obtaining and maintaining public support and funding, and establishing laws and policies for trees on public and on private land. Urban forestry presents many social issues that require addressing to allow urban forestry {{to be seen by}} the many as an advantage rather than a curse on their environment. Social issues include under funding which leads to inadequate maintenance of urban trees. In the UK the National Urban <b>Forestry</b> <b>Unit</b> produced a series of case studies around best practice in urban forestry which is archived here.|$|E

40|$|We are {{currently}} witnessing ordinary citizens {{willing to share}} geospatial information using friendly and easy-to use tools provided by Web 2. 0 platforms. These platforms act as social networks describing events with large social impacts. Social networks are filled with volunteered information before, during, and after events that occur near human settlements and urban areas. The amount of this geolocated information is increasing due to the increase of location-aware devices that allow users {{in the field to}} share knowledge about an event’s evolution and impact. In order to retrieve this information one interacts with the different search mechanisms provided by various Web 2. 0 services. This paper explores how to improve the interoperability of these various Web 2. 0 platforms by providing a single service as a unique entry. This paper demonstrates the utility of the Open Geospatial Consortium’s Open Search Geospatial and Time specification as an interface for a service that searches, retrieves and aggregates information available in different Web 2. 0 services. We present how this information is useful in complementing other official and scientific information sources by providing an alternative, contemporary source of information. We demonstrate this with a proof of concept presented in a forest fire scenario. The intrinsic interoperability of the system is reflected in the collaborations shown with different information systems such as those at the biodiversity and <b>forestry</b> <b>units</b> in the Institute of Environment and Sustainability at the Joint Research Centre...|$|R
