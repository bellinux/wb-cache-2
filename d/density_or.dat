5|$|The {{strength}} {{and range of}} the electric force and the good conductivity of plasmas usually ensure that the densities {{of positive and negative}} charges in any sizeable region are equal ("quasineutrality"). A plasma with a significant excess of charge <b>density,</b> <b>or,</b> in the extreme case, is composed of a single species, is called a non-neutral plasma. In such a plasma, electric fields play a dominant role. Examples are charged particle beams, an electron cloud in a Penning trap and positron plasmas.|$|E
5|$|Estimates put {{the average}} energy {{density of the}} Universe at the {{equivalent}} of 5.9 protons per cubic meter, including dark energy, dark matter, and baryonic matter (ordinary matter composed of atoms). The atoms account for only 4.6% of the total energy <b>density,</b> <b>or</b> a density of one proton per four cubic meters. The density of the Universe, however, is clearly not uniform; it ranges from relatively high density in galaxies—including very high density in structures within galaxies, such as planets, stars, and black holes—to conditions in vast voids that have much lower density, {{at least in terms}} of visible matter. Unlike the matter and dark matter, the dark energy seems not to be concentrated in galaxies: although dark energy may account for a majority of the mass-energy in the Universe, dark energy's influence is 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the influence of gravity from matter and dark matter within the Milky Way.|$|E

40|$|The {{fluctuations}} in <b>densities</b> <b>or</b> biomass {{of a number}} of invading and native polychaete and mollusc species in the Southwest Netherlands were compared over a period of 20 years. For recent invaders a lag phase of 7 – 10 years occurred after their first appearance, followed by an exponential increase in abundance or biomass for 2 – 3 years. High numbers and biomass then continued for about 5 years, followed by a strong decline. The total sequence from introduction to decline lasted about 15 years. The <b>densities</b> <b>or</b> biomass of invaders appearing decades or even centuries ago in the Delta area have fluctuated in a similar manner to those of native species, indicating that the <b>densities</b> <b>or</b> biomass of invading species after a 15 -year period of strong changes become governed largely by the same environmental factors as native species. The conclusion may be that after some decades, invading species can become part of a balanced co-existence with the native species, and that this may yield a net gain in the overall diversity...|$|R

50|$|For example, {{consider}} {{a very simple}} system with three microbial species. It may be possible for the system to exist under different community structure regimes depending on initial conditions (e.g., population <b>densities</b> <b>or</b> spatial arrangement of individuals) (Kerr et al. 2002). Perhaps under certain initial <b>densities</b> <b>or</b> spatial configurations, one species dominates over all others, while under different initial conditions all species can mutually coexist. Because the different species interact, changes in populations affect one another synergistically to determine community structure. Under both states the environmental conditions are identical. Because the states have resilience, following small perturbations (e.g., changes to population size) the community returns to the same configuration while large perturbations may induce a shift to another configuration.|$|R
