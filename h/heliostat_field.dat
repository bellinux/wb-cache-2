40|$|Heliostats {{of central}} {{receiver}} {{solar power plants}} reach dimensions up to 150 m 2 with focal lengths up to 1000 m. Their optical properties and tracking accuracy have great influence on the power plant efficiency {{and need to be}} monitored both at plant start up and during operation. Up to now, there are few efficient and fast measurement techniques that allow the heliostat properties to be measured. Flux density measurements and close-range photogrammetry are possible approaches, yet they do not fulfill the requirement to be accurate, inexpensive and fast at the same time. In this paper, we present a non-contact measurement principle, which uses edge detection to extract the heliostat and facet vertices. This information is used to calculate the surface normals. Furthermore, the corners can replace retroreflective targets generally used in close-range photogrammetry, thus enabling a fast and completely automatic evaluation of the three-dimensional heliostat structure. The pictures are provided by a digital camera which is mounted on a pan tilt head on top of the central receiver tower, offering visibility to all heliostats and allowing the automated qualification of whole <b>heliostat</b> <b>fields</b> {{in a short period of}} time. It is shown that measurement uncertainties in heliostat orientation for the investigated heliostat are below 4 mrad in 80 % of the relevant heliostat positions. Heliostat orientation is available within three minutes. Photogrammetric measurements based on edge detection at a 40 -m 2 CESA- 1 heliostat at the Plataforma Solar de Almerìa (PSA) exhibit an accuracy of 1. 6 mrad for a single-facet normal vector with the results being available within 30 minutes.

In recent years several canting concepts were used, mainly on- and off-axis canting. Several new canting concepts, like stretched-parabolic or target aligned canting, were proposed in order to improve the performance of heliostats. As solar power plants become economically more attractive, knowledge about the influence of canting becomes more important. In this contribution, the influence of several factors on the canting method is discussed and optimal canting strategies are described. The considered factors comprise plant power level, heliostat position in the <b>field,</b> <b>heliostat</b> area, receiver dimension and site latitude.
