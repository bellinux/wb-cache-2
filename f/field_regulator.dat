The units are not equivalent, and the conversion depends on the mole-cular weight of the compound. Converting between units (e. g., µg/L to µg/m 3, percent to ppmv) is also causing headaches.

Residential values are erro-neously applied at commercial sites, incorrect attenuation factors are being used to determine tar-get values, or values determined from predictive models are incor-rect. The soil-gas target level ulti-mately determines the required analytical method and the need for additional assessment.
