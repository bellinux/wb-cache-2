40|$|The paper {{studies the}} role and {{influence}} of operational capability and competitive market drivers required for satisfying customers with <b>innovative</b> <b>service</b> that encourages customer promotion behaviour in the Chinese context. Based on inside out and outside in strategies that include both resource based view and market priorities, the study develop models to match <b>innovative</b> <b>service</b> satisfaction with customer promotion behaviour. We captured the importance of operational capability drivers on <b>innovative</b> <b>service</b> satisfaction, market priority drivers on customer promotion behaviour and the match between <b>innovative</b> <b>service</b> satisfaction and customer promotion behaviour using three models. We carried out an empirical survey to validate our three models and hypotheses. We find operational capability drivers such as physical product, staff attributes and services have positive relationship with <b>innovative</b> <b>service</b> satisfaction. In terms of market priority drivers’ budget hotels have to concentrate on location and image. Finally, we find that budget hotel can be successful if {{it is able to}} convert service satisfaction to increase customer promotion behaviour. The major contributions of this study are to propose models integrating consumer behaviour and service operations literature and to validate our <b>innovative</b> <b>service</b> satisfaction and customer promotion behaviour models in the Chinese budget hotel context...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} compares human-robot {{interaction with}} human-human interaction. More specifically, it compares potential customer {{responses to a}} humanoid service robot’s (HSR’s) behavioral cues during service encounters with those expressed by a human service employee. The behavioral cues tested in this study include <b>innovative</b> <b>service</b> behavior, defined as {{the extent to which}} a service representative creates new ideas and solutions for the customer. Based on role theory and the expectancy disconfirmation paradigm, we propose that customers generally respond positively toward an HSR’s artificial <b>innovative</b> <b>service</b> behavior cues. The experimental laboratory study with 132 student participants and an HSR of the Pepper type, shows positive responses to an HSR’s artificial <b>innovative</b> <b>service</b> behavior, but that those responses are weaker compared to human-human interactions within a similar setting. Furthermore, <b>innovative</b> <b>service</b> behavior cues exceed customer expectations and therefore, lead to customer satisfaction and delight with the HSR...|$|R

2500|$|On average, Communications service {{providers}} utilize {{an average of}} just 35 to 40 percent of available network capacity. Recently, telecommunications software vendors such as Telcordia and Ericsson have promoted yield management as a strategy for communications {{service providers}} to generate additional revenue and reduce capital expenditures by maximizing subscriber use of available network bandwidth. Approaches include basing a strategy on <b>innovative</b> <b>services</b> explicitly designed to use only spare capacity and borrowing proven methods from the airline industry. The approach can {{be more difficult to}} implement in the telecommunications industry than the airlines sector because of the difficulty to control and sometimes refuse network access to customers. Similarities that exist between the airline and telecom industries include a large sunk cost combined with low marginal cost, perishable inventory, reservations, pricing flexibility and the opportunity to upsell. Differences that present challenges for communications service providers include low-value transactions and overall network complexity. Suggested approaches to executing a successful yield management strategy include accurate network information collection, bandwidth capacity allocation that doesn’t impact service quality, the deployment of service management software such as real time policy and real-time charging, and using new marketing channels to target consumers [...] with <b>innovative</b> <b>services.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} {{the authors are}} {{analysing}} the application of NuServ model for the process of <b>innovative</b> <b>service</b> development. Having analysed the mechanism of the internal innovative development process and factors that determine this process it was established that innovative activity should {{be described as a}} complex process which comprises the creation of novelty, its distribution and use. Innovative activity is often a complex dynamic system; its efficiency depends mostly on internal mechanism of innovative activity and on the interaction with external environment. Factors of innovation development correlate directly with the project cycle of innovative activity and principally reflect the process of development of <b>innovative</b> product or <b>service.</b> A primary stage of the project cycle of innovative activity is identification of innovation, when the decision about project implementation is made and some plans for the project implementation are prepared. This stage is called fundamental, as it determines the possibilities for implementation of <b>innovative</b> product or <b>service</b> and perspectives for exploitation. After the feasibility of NuServ model for the process of <b>innovative</b> <b>service</b> development has been evaluated it was established that innovation is a process, sustainable current, when an enterprise which develops <b>innovative</b> <b>service</b> must pass particular phases in order to develop the idea, to examine new market and to design the service. Having preliminary calculated necessary costs for service implementation, an enterprise should describe its functionality and should enter the market with a service certain for its guaranteed success. NuServ model for the process of <b>innovative</b> <b>service</b> development perfectly characterises the innovative service; it thoroughly reveals service development in the early stage.

For that reason, a model has been developed and empirically tested using data collected from 100 physicians regarding an <b>innovative</b> e-detailing <b>service.</b> Results show that physicians’ purchase intention is significantly influenced by five factors. Three of them derive from the integration of Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with the Theory of Planned behaviour (TPB), i. e. perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and professional image. The rest, namely work experience, working status and innovativeness, refer to physicians’ professional characteristics. Work experience and innovativeness were found to {{have a significant effect on}} physicians’ perceptions of the <b>innovative</b> <b>service,</b> whereas, physicians’ current working status was not found to have significant influence on either their perceptions of the <b>innovative</b> <b>service</b> or their purchase intention...|$|R
