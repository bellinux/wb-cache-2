5|$|An <b>infinite</b> <b>loop</b> {{may occur}} if the exit {{conditions}} for the loop are not defined correctly. Once L exceeds R, the search has failed and must convey {{the failure of the}} search. In addition, the loop must be exited when the target element is found, {{or in the case of}} an implementation where this check is moved to the end, checks for whether the search was successful or failed at the end must be in place. Bentley found that, in his assignment of binary search, most of the programmers who implemented binary search incorrectly made an error defining the exit conditions.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins on}} April 1, with Makoto {{awakening}} from a nightmare {{of a girl}} dying on April 6 with a bell in her hand. As the week goes on, he occasionally experiences premonitions of the future, all of which come true. Depending on the player's choices, Makoto ends up getting close {{to one of the}} girls, and on April 5, the story branches into different routes focusing on one of them. In each route, the girl Makoto was close to dies on April 6 with a bell in her hand. Afterwards, Makoto finds that he has traveled back in time to April 1, retaining the memories of the previous six days. Concluding that he is trapped in an <b>infinite</b> <b>loop,</b> he vows to keep the girl alive and break free of the loop. He does so by rebuilding his relationships with her while dealing with the emotional problem troubling her. On April 6, the girl ends up in a situation similar to when she died in the last loop, but Makoto saves her, breaking free of the loop and becoming her boyfriend.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Global SLS-resolution and SLG-resolution are two {{representative}} {{mechanisms for}} top-down {{evaluation of the}} well-founded semantics of general logic programs. Global SLS-resolution is linear but suffers from <b>infinite</b> <b>loops</b> and redundant computations. In contrast, SLG-resolution resolves <b>infinite</b> <b>loops</b> and redundant computations by means of tabling, {{but it is not}} linear. The distinctive advantage of a linear approach is that it can be implemented using a simple, efficient stack-based memory structure like that in Prolog. In this paper we present a linear tabulated resolution for the well-founded semantics, which resolves the problems of <b>infinite</b> <b>loops</b> and redundant computations while preserving the linearity. For non-floundering queries, the proposed method is sound and complete for general logic programs with the bounded-term-size property. ...|$|R
25|$|In computing, {{a program}} error {{may result from}} an attempt to divide by zero. Depending on the {{programming}} environment {{and the type of}} number (e.g. floating point, integer) being divided by zero, it may generate positive or negative infinity by the IEEE 754 floating point standard, generate an exception, generate an error message, cause the program to terminate, result in a special not-a-number value, a freeze via <b>infinite</b> <b>loop,</b> or a crash.|$|E
25|$|An early model which governed the {{allocation}} of time to programs was called cooperative multitasking. In this model, when control is passed to a program by the kernel, it may execute {{for as long as}} it wants before explicitly returning control to the kernel. This means that a malicious or malfunctioning program may not only prevent any other programs from using the CPU, but it can hang the entire system if it enters an <b>infinite</b> <b>loop.</b>|$|E
25|$|Other {{languages}} such as Epigram {{make the}} value of all expressions in the language decidable so that type checking can be decidable. However, in general proof of decidability is undecidable, so many programs require hand-written annotations that may be very non-trivial. As this impedes the development process, many language implementations provide an easy {{way out in the}} form of an option to disable this condition. This, however, comes at the cost of making the type-checker run in an <b>infinite</b> <b>loop</b> when fed programs that do not type-check, causing the compilation to fail.|$|E

40|$|<b>Infinite</b> <b>loops</b> and {{redundant}} computations {{are long}} recognized open problems in Prolog. Two ways have been explored {{to resolve these}} problems: loop checking and tabling. Loop checking can cut <b>infinite</b> <b>loops,</b> but it cannot be both sound and complete even for function-free logic programs. Tabling {{seems to be an}} effective way to resolve <b>infinite</b> <b>loops</b> and redundant computations. However, existing tabulated resolutions, such as OLDT-resolution, SLG- resolution, and Tabulated SLS-resolution, are non-linear because they rely on the solution-lookup mode in formulating tabling. The principal disadvantage of non-linear resolutions is that they cannot be implemented using a simple stack-based memory structure like that in Prolog. Moreover, some strictly sequential operators such as cuts may not be handled as easily as in Prolog. In this paper, we propose a hybrid method to resolve <b>infinite</b> <b>loops</b> and redundant computations. We combine the ideas of loop checking and tabling to establish a linear tabulated resolution called TP-resolution. TP-resolution has two distinctive features: (1) It makes linear tabulated derivations {{in the same way as}} Prolog except that <b>infinite</b> <b>loops</b> are broken and redundant computations are reduced. It handles cuts as effectively as Prolog. (2) It is sound and complete for positive logic programs with the bounded-term-size property. The underlying algorithm can be implemented by an extension to any existing Prolog abstract machines such as WAM or ATOAM.

500|$|Those {{who possess}} the Sharingan also {{have access to}} two of the most {{powerful}} genjutsu, [...] and [...] Both techniques work in reverse: Izanagi allows the user to [...] "alter destiny"; they may turn moments inflicted on them (such as injury or death blow) into mere illusions, though only for several seconds.

Both techniques are labeled as forbidden jutsu, as they will permanently close the user's Sharingan eye.

500|$|The {{development}} team depicted {{reality in}} the world of Never 7 as subjective and relative rather than absolute. As such, for each route, that route's history is the only one Makoto knows and the only one that is real to him; the Curé syndrome only exists to him in the routes where it is mentioned. The bells were used as symbols for reality being relative, and were described by the development team as [...] "vague existences", saying that one cannot know if they exist or not. In the bad ending to Izumi's route, the bells, which [...] "should be fictional" [...] remain while something that should exist disappears; this was a metaphor for the idea that delusions become reality while reality becomes a delusion. The game's title comes from how Makoto is unable to escape the <b>infinite</b> <b>loop</b> and reach April 7, and how most of the seven characters die {{at some point during the}} game. It is also based on the belief that 7 is a lucky number. The game was designed to be open to speculation and multiple interpretations, a design philosophy that was carried over to later entries in the series and was part of what led to Infinity being chosen as the series title. One example of the openness to interpretation was that development team did not want to confirm or deny whether the game's world was connected to that of the Memories Off series, saying that while characters with similar names may appear, they wanted to leave the player to decide for themselves what the answer would be.|$|E
