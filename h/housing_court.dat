500|$|Three {{days after}} the disaster, the city sued the owners and {{managers}} of the building in the <b>Housing</b> <b>Court</b> due {{to a number of}} breaches in building regulations. Those named in the complaint included LG Properties, the company's president Philip Pappas, and George Koutroumos, the contractor who built the balcony. The city was reportedly seeking $500 per violation for each day the structure was in existence, totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars, and a court order for the replacement of the balcony. The apartment block was legally uninhabitable until the balconies were replaced, as they provided mandatory emergency exits. The city's Buildings Department inspected forty-two other buildings owned or managed by Pappas and/or LG Properties for similar violations. The city also claimed that twenty-one other buildings owned by Pappas had similar problems. They did, however, note {{the fact that he had}} since made [...] "dramatic improvements" [...] to all twenty-one porches.|$|E
