40|$|AbstractEven in {{the absence}} of serious {{injuries}} and fatalities, landslide and flood events can have significant socio-economic impacts. These include the severance of access to and from relatively remote communities for services and markets for goods; employment, health and educational opportunities; and social activities. The <b>economic</b> <b>impacts</b> can be classified as: direct <b>economic</b> <b>impacts,</b> direct consequential <b>economic</b> <b>impacts,</b> and indirect consequential <b>economic</b> <b>impacts.</b> In addition, the vulnerability shadow cast can be extensive and its geographical extent can be determined by the transport network rather than the relatively small footprint of the event itself. Using a number of debris flow events and a flood event in Scotland this paper places values on the <b>economic</b> <b>impacts</b> of landslides and floods.

5|$|Poverty can {{increase}} the risk of malaria since those in poverty do not have the financial capacities to prevent or treat the disease. In its entirety, the <b>economic</b> <b>impact</b> of malaria has been estimated to cost Africa US$12 billion every year. The <b>economic</b> <b>impact</b> includes costs of health care, working days lost due to sickness, days lost in education, decreased productivity due to brain damage from cerebral malaria, and loss of investment and tourism. The disease has a heavy burden in some countries, where it may be responsible for 30–50% of hospital admissions, up to 50% of outpatient visits, and up to 40% of public health spending.|$|E

40|$|A {{generalized}} {{framework of}} Economic Analysis {{of natural and}} man-made disasters {{is applied to the}} estimation of business interruption losses associated with an oil spill. Specifically, this framework is applied to the Deepwater Horizon incident which occurred on April 20, 2010 and resulted in the extensive fouling of the Gulf of Mexico waters and the associated coastline. The region of analysis is the coastline extending east from Louisiana to the Pan-handle of Florida. <b>Economic</b> <b>impacts</b> were measured as business interruption losses reported as lost Gross Domestic product at the county, state, and national level. Short-run <b>economic</b> <b>impacts</b> were evaluated using the Regional Economic Accounting Tool, based on Input-Output methodology, for business interruptions of less than one year. Medium- and Long-run <b>economic</b> <b>impacts</b> were estimated using the Regional Economic Models, Inc. REMI. The REMI Model is a dynamic hybrid model that combines econometric, input-output, and computable general equilibrium equations to estimated <b>economic</b> <b>impacts.</b> Regional <b>economic</b> <b>impacts,</b> as measured by loss GDP, were found to be of more concern than national impacts.

40|$|The double-crested {{cormorant}} (Phalacrocorax auritus) {{has undergone a}} significant range expansion in the Great Lakes area of the United States since the 1970 s, negatively impacting native fish populations and sport fisheries.

This analysis estimates the potential direct and regional <b>economic</b> <b>impacts</b> of the cormorant to a recreational fishery. We estimated that the potential economic loss was on average $ 5 million to $ 66 million annually, as well as 66 to 929 job-years in the region annually over a 20 -year period (1990 to 2009).
