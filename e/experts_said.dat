5|$|It {{was also}} {{predicted}} that the standing water caused by the storm surge would render {{most of the city}} uninhabitable for weeks and that the destruction of oil and petrochemical refineries in the surrounding area would spill waste into the flooding. The resulting mess would coat every surface, converting the city into a toxic marsh until water could be drained. Some <b>experts</b> <b>said</b> that it could take six months or longer to pump all the water out of the city.|$|E
5|$|At {{the request}} of federal {{authorities}} before sentencing, Vick agreed to deposit nearly $1 million in an escrow account with attorneys to reimburse others for the costs of caring for the confiscated dogs, {{most of which were}} being offered for adoption on a selective basis under supervision of a court-appointed specialist. <b>Experts</b> <b>said</b> some of the animals would require special care {{for the rest of their}} lives. During the administration of his bankruptcy case, the U.S. Department of Labor complained that these funds were paid at least partially with unlawfully withdrawn monies that Vick held in trust for himself and eight other employees of MV7, a celebrity marketing company he owned.|$|E

5|$|Although Malaysia's acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein, who is {{also the}} country's Defence Minister, denied the {{existence}} of problems between the participating countries, academics said that because of regional conflicts, there were genuine trust issues involved in co-operation and sharing intelligence, and that these were hampering the search. International relations <b>experts</b> <b>said</b> entrenched rivalries over sovereignty, security, intelligence, and national interests made meaningful multilateral co-operation very difficult. A Chinese academic made the observation that the parties were searching independently; thus it was not a multilateral search effort. The Guardian noted the Vietnamese permission given for Chinese aircraft to overfly its airspace as a positive sign of co-operation. Vietnam temporarily scaled back its search operations after the country's Deputy Transport Minister cited a lack of communication from Malaysian officials despite requests for more information. China, through the official Xinhua News Agency, said that the Malaysian government ought to take charge and conduct the operation with greater transparency, a point echoed by the Chinese Foreign Ministry days later.|$|E
5|$|The legal Underbelly DVD was {{released}} 8 May 2008 by Roadshow Entertainment, {{a day after}} the final episode was aired on television. In accordance with the legal suppression, the release was not distributed through any retail or rental outlets in Victoria or on the internet. Roadshow Entertainment has confirmed that all box sets and point of sale displays will carry a sticker or stamp reminding buyers the series is not for sale, distribution or exhibition in Victoria. Legal <b>experts</b> <b>said</b> Victorians who bought the box set interstate and watched it themselves at home would likely not fall foul of the law, but anyone who showed it more widely could be charged with contempt. The DVD has sold 265,000 copies around Australia. In September 2008, a Limited Edition DVD {{was released}}, containing a numbered steel case and an extra disc with a documentary entitled Carl Williams– A Day of Reckoning. The Underbelly soundtrack was released on 29 March 2008, both as a CD and online. It features elements of the score by Burkhard Dallwitz in addition to music tracks that were featured in the series. Underbelly was released on Blu-ray on 5 August 2010.|$|E

25|$|At {{least ten}} monuments, {{including}} the Verrazzano, Coast Guard and Wireless memorials, were {{stored in the}} park behind a temporary fence from 2004 or 2005 until 2016 {{as the result of}} a long-term renovation of Battery Park. Controversy over the statues' integrity arose in 2015 after renovations took longer than expected. Representatives of NYC Park Advocates and the Italian-American organization UNICO expressed concern about the statues' condition, although <b>experts</b> <b>said</b> there should be no long-term physical harm. The monuments have since been installed in or around the perimeter of the park, although not necessarily in their previous locations.|$|E
25|$|On 30 November, racing {{against the}} threat of {{dissolution}} by Supreme Constitutional Court judges appointed by the ousted Mubarak, quickly defusing anger about Morsi's 22 November declaration granting himself expanded presidential powers and ignoring howls of protest from secular opponents, the Islamists drafting the new constitution voted on 29 November 2012 to approve the 2012 Draft Constitution of Egypt that human rights groups and international <b>experts</b> <b>said</b> was full of holes and ambiguities and that was criticized by secular, liberal and Coptic Egyptians. Thousands of Egyptians {{took to the streets}} in various governorates to denounce the constitutional declaration issued on 22 November, as well as the final draft of the constitution approved by the Islamist-dominated Constituent Assembly.|$|E
25|$|Regardless, {{when the}} Australian side for the Johnnie Walker ICC Super Series was announced, {{three members of}} the Ashes-losing side were dropped: Damien Martyn was {{retained}} only for the ODI squad, while Jason Gillespie and Michael Kasprowicz were dropped altogether. Brad Hodge, Stuart MacGill and Shane Watson were added in their places. While Cricket Australia officials assured that these omissions were not a signal that the Test careers of these three players were over, many <b>experts</b> <b>said</b> otherwise. However, all three players made successful returns to the Test team in early 2006. Lillee once again called for the replacement of Ponting as captain with Warne after the squad announcement, however this was once again rejected.|$|E

25|$|The flood {{destroyed}} {{agricultural production}} {{in the state of}} Tabasco, the largest producer of cocoa in the country and a major source of bananas, but is not expected that losses affect international prices, <b>experts</b> <b>said</b> on Friday. Tabasco produces 80% of all Mexico's cocoa and 40% of its bananas, according to Luis Rey Carrasco Linares, an expert from the Autonomous University of Chapingo with his squad in Tabasco. The heavy rains that punished the state {{for more than a week}} occurred during the cocoa harvest, which lasts from September to December, Carrasco said. All this year's harvest is under water and was lost, he added. The floods caused profound devastation to agriculture, which is a Principal source of Income in the state.|$|E
25|$|Internet {{security}} <b>experts</b> <b>said</b> {{that the}} passwords {{were easy to}} unscramble because of LinkedIn's failure to use a salt when hashing them, which is considered an insecure practice because it allows attackers to quickly reverse the scrambling process using existing standard rainbow tables, pre-made lists of matching scrambled and unscrambled passwords. Another issue that sparked controversy was the iOS app provided by LinkedIn, which grabs personal names, emails, and notes from a mobile calendar without the user's approval. Security experts working for Skycure Security said that the application collects a user's personal data and sends it to the LinkedIn server. LinkedIn claimed the permission for this feature is user-granted, and the information is sent securely using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. The company added that it had never stored or shared that information with a third party.|$|E
25|$|Many boxing {{analysts and}} <b>experts</b> <b>said</b> that Darren Barker has {{the skills and}} ring generalship to one day become a champion, but that his skills were not perfected enough to do {{anything}} against Martínez. The first few rounds showed that Barker was actually able to make Martínez uncomfortable in the ring and give him more trouble than expected. Throughout the fight, Barker consistently gave Martínez problems, while never hurting him or really ever winning any of the rounds, he gave Martínez a challenge by coming in but not giving much offence to let Martínez counter or land anything clean. He also managed to get Martínez's nose to bleed early in the rounds by an upper-cut. Martínez, however, fought through the difficulty and eventually found openings {{which led to a}} knock-out of Barker, in the 11th with a right hook.|$|E

25|$|Maintenance of {{the eternal}} flame is an ongoing issue. Arlington National Cemetery <b>experts</b> <b>said</b> in 2001 that it cost about $200 a month to keep the flame burning. As of 2010, Fenwal Controls, a gas {{equipment}} manufacturer based in Boston, was the contractor responsible for maintaining the flame. The eternal flame's original, custom-manufactured ignition system was contained in a weather-proof box buried {{a few feet from}} the grave site. The system controlled the flow of gas and oxygen to the flame and kept it lit via a high-voltage cable and 20,000-volt spark ignition electrode near the gas burner. No longer constantly sparking to keep the flame lit, the system monitored the flame and activated the ignition system only when the flame was extinguished. The electrode was specially designed for outdoor use. Oversight of the flame's maintenance was provided by the Army Corps of Engineers, which contracted with Fenwal Controls to ensure the eternal flame was maintained and upgraded as needed. According to Arlington National Cemetery historian Tom Sherlock, when the gas burner required maintenance the flame was shut off. But maintenance needs were so minimal that no living Fenwal Controls employee had seen the interior of the ignition system. An on-site visit was planned by Fenwal Controls for early 2010 to inspect the eternal flame and conduct a review of the ignition and burner systems.|$|E
25|$|On 26 January 2007, {{a dispute}} arose between Adam Air and the Indonesian {{government}} regarding the retrieval {{of the black}} boxes. Due to the depth involved, recovery required an underwater remotely operated vehicle, but due {{to the cost of}} using this method of recovery—especially since such equipment needed to be shipped in from elsewhere—the government placed the responsibility for the cost of recovering the recorders on Adam Air. Vice-President of Indonesia Jusuf Kalla went as far as to question the need to retrieve the black boxes at all, although <b>experts</b> <b>said</b> in response that the accident was of international significance as it could indicate a fault with the aircraft. Adam Air said that in its opinion, the black boxes should be recovered, describing the accident as being relevant on both national and international levels, but refused to pay, saying that was the responsibility of the government. Indonesia did request technical assistance from the United States, Japan and France. Jim Hall, {{a former chairman of the}} US National Transportation Safety Board, said that it was essential the boxes be recovered quickly, as at that point their 30-day battery life was about to expire, which subsequently did happen. He cited problems such as poor visibility and strong currents making it difficult to recover the devices without the signal. Setio Rahardjo, Head of National Committee for Transportation Safety, estimated that equipment for the salvage operation, if available, would cost US$100,000 per day to hire in an operation that would take around ten days, equating to US$1 million.|$|E
500|$|Management <b>experts</b> <b>said</b> {{that the}} source of the problem was setting an {{unrealistic}} goal of a 14-day wait. This was compounded by not including provisions for measuring how well the system was working. <b>Experts</b> <b>said</b> that having high-stakes goals, especially without checks and balances, encouraged [...] "gaming the numbers" [...] and cheating, in the private and public sector. Managers at the Federal level should have had data about times and costs for basic services throughout the VA system. That would have identified the Phoenix facility as anomalous.|$|E
