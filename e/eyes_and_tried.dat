25|$|Devil's Due Publishing and Image Comics {{introduced}} new elements into Snake Eyes' past {{during their}} Snake Eyes Declassified miniseries, which {{show more of}} Cobra Commander's motivation to kill Snake Eyes while training to become a ninja. Snake Eyes had an encounter with Cobra Commander prior {{to the formation of}} Cobra, where Cobra Commander befriended Snake <b>Eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> to recruit him into murdering a judge. The judge had convicted Cobra Commander's older brother of arson and insurance fraud, resulting in the ruin of his brother's life, causing his spiral downward into alcoholism, and ultimately the car accident that claimed both his life and the lives of Snake Eyes' family. Snake Eyes agreed to accompany Cobra Commander, but at the last minute refused {{to go along with the}} plan. Cobra Commander then killed the judge, and swore revenge against Snake Eyes, resulting in him hiring Firefly (who in turn subcontracted Zartan) to kill Snake Eyes while he was training with the Arashikage Clan.|$|E
60|$|The doctor {{opened his}} <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> {{to look as}} though ready to be surprised.|$|E
60|$|A sudden {{illuminating}} {{flash of}} horror {{told her the}} truth. She closed her <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> to run from the room.|$|E

6000|$|... "Whether Frascatti {{is right}} or not," [...] said Patsy, drying her <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> to be brave, [...] "we ought to search for Uncle John at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, John," [...] she said. The spaniel John, {{showing the}} whites of his <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> to back through his collar, was {{assisted}} from the room. Mr. Pendyce {{closed the door behind}} them.|$|R
60|$|A sound {{suspiciously like}} a giggle {{came from the}} landing and fell heavily on Gale's ears. He closed his <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> to think.|$|E
60|$|The Hoppers {{looked at}} one another questioningly and blinked their <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> to think what it all meant; but they couldn't figure it out.|$|E
60|$|As if {{compelled}} {{against her}} will--answering to an irresistible voice--Bess raised her head, {{looked at him}} with sad, dark <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> to whisper with tremulous lips.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hero!" [...] his {{companion}} murmured. [...] "Don't you brood over this thing, Jacob. Close your <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> count sheep, {{or something of}} that sort. Call me in if you get very melancholy during the night, and I'll read to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{you must}} not talk any more, Cuthbert. Your hands are cold, let me put the rug over them. There, you look more comfortable. Now shut your <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> to get to sleep until the doctor comes round." ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{a harness}} store we found {{ourselves}} in, and he fixed me up a couch of horse blankets in the private office well to the rear. To add to my wretchedness a splitting headache was coming on, and I was only too glad to close my <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> to sleep.|$|R
6000|$|I dried my <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> to look {{steadily}} at her. 'Yes, Lady Georgina,' I faltered. 'You {{need not}} be afraid. I have refused him; and I mean it.' ...|$|E
60|$|Charlie ran in again, {{seized a}} coil of rope, bound {{his hands and}} feet securely, and dragged him into the hut. Then he dashed some cold water on his face. The man opened his <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> to move.|$|E
60|$|By a great {{exertion}} of strength, {{he closed}} the two old gates, which were deeply sunken in the mud, and barred them with a heavy beam. That done, he shook his matted hair from about his <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> them.--Strong and fast.|$|E
60|$|He {{closed his}} <b>eyes</b> impatiently, <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> to shut her {{out in a}} {{darkness}} of his own making.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{daguerreotype}} likeness, do you mean?" [...] asked Phoebe {{with less}} reserve; for, {{in spite of}} prejudice, her own youthfulness sprang forward to meet his. [...] "I don't much like pictures of that sort,--they are so hard and stern; besides dodging away from the <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> to escape altogether. They are conscious of looking very unamiable, I suppose, and therefore hate to be seen." ...|$|R
5000|$|One {{player is}} chosen as [...] "It". This player closes {{his or her}} <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>tries</b> to find <b>and</b> tag the other players {{without the use of}} vision. The player who is [...] "It" [...] shouts [...] "Marco" [...] and the other players must respond by {{shouting}} [...] "Polo", which [...] "It" [...] uses to try to acoustically locate them. If a player is tagged, then that player becomes [...] "It." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Power {{had been}} {{interested}} in her from the first; had watched her through other <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> her by various unsuspected tests. She stood them well; showed her faults as frankly as her virtues, and tried to deserve their esteem by copying the excellencies she admired in them.|$|E
60|$|So it was settled, and the German {{proceeded}} {{to make himself}} and the others as comfortable as possible. He prepared something to eat, and suggested that Tom be given a little broth, made out of some dried meat. This was done, and presently the sufferer opened his <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> to sit up.|$|E
6000|$|Kemp had hurried upstairs after letting Adye out, and now {{crouching}} {{among the}} broken glass and peering cautiously {{over the edge of}} the study window sill, he saw Adye stand parleying with the Unseen. [...] "Why doesn't he fire?" [...] whispered Kemp to himself. Then the revolver moved a little and the glint of the sunlight flashed in Kemp's eyes. He shaded his <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> to see the source of the blinding beam.|$|E
5000|$|To {{discover}} the hidden {{image of a}} Magic Eye, hold the picture against your nose {{and focus on the}} background of the picture. Do not move your <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> not to blink. This will look blurry as you are [...] "diverging" [...] your eyes. Slowly pull the picture away from your face while staring into the background. Once the image pops out in 3D, you can look around the picture and enjoy.|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, by {{this time}} {{we were on the}} peacefullest of terms. When I saw that he wasn't after Miss Willella, I had more endurable contemplations of that sandy-haired snoozer. In order to help out the ambitions of his {{appetite}} I kept on trying to get that receipt from Miss Willella. But every time I would say 'pancakes' she would get sort of remote and fidgety about the <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> to change the subject. If I held her to it she would slide out and round up Uncle Emsley with his pitcher of water and hip-pocket howitzer.|$|R
60|$|Through {{the dust}} and smoke of ages, and through the centuries of wars we strain our <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> to gain a glimpse of thee, Master, in thy good days, when the Muses walked with thee. We seem to mark thee {{wandering}} silent through some little village, or dreaming in the woods, or loitering among thy lonely places, or in gardens where the roses blossom among wilder flowers, or on river banks where the whispering poplars and sighing reeds make answer to the murmur of the waters. Such a picture hast thou drawn of thyself in the summer afternoons.|$|R
6000|$|I {{have this}} day the melancholy news of Glengarry's death, and was greatly shocked. The {{eccentric}} {{parts of his}} character, the pretensions which he supported with violence and assumption of rank and authority, were obvious subjects of censure and ridicule, which in some points were not undeserved. He played {{the part of a}} chieftain too nigh the life to be popular among an altered race, with whom he thought, felt, and acted, I may say in right and wrong, as a chieftain of a hundred years since would have done, while his conduct was viewed entirely by modern <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> by modern rules.[117] ...|$|E
60|$|Then, all at once, {{the coolness}} {{of the morning}} air caught her full in the face. She opened her <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> to move, but those {{powerful}} arms held her more closely than before. Now she could have shrieked with horror. With returning consciousness the sense of her desperate position came on her with its full and ghastly significance, its awe-inspiring details. The grey dawn, the abandoned wretch who held her, and the stillness of this early morning hour, when not one pitying soul would be astir to lend her a helping hand or give her the solace of mute sympathy. So great, indeed, was this stillness that the click of the man's sabots upon the uneven pavement reverberated, ghoul-like and weird.|$|E
6000|$|Such prayers avail much, {{and such}} entire devotion often {{seems to work}} miracles when other aids are in vain. Phebe's cry was answered, her self-forgetful task accomplished, and her long vigil rewarded with a happy dawn. Dr. Alec always said that she kept him alive {{by the force of}} her will, and that, during the hours when he seemed to lie unconscious, he felt a strong, warm hand holding his, as if keeping him away from the swift current trying to sweep him away. The happiest hour of all her life was that in which he knew her, looked up with the shadow of a smile in his hollow <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> to say in his old cheery way: [...] "Tell Rose I've turned the corner, thanks to you, my child." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here, Terrence," [...] said Massey, {{handing him}} an empty pipe, {{at the same}} time asking him to shut his <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> draw, <b>and</b> <b>try</b> to imagine himself smoking, but Terrence shook his head.|$|R
50|$|When {{their mutual}} crush Leviathan sacrificed himself {{to save the}} team from Doctor Regulus, Violet went berserk and {{revealed}} her possession by the Emerald <b>Eye</b> <b>and</b> then possessed the Legion {{in order to find}} a way to revive Leviathan. Zoe was in the <b>Eye's</b> thrall <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> to take the Eye for herself, but was rejected by it and nearly killed.|$|R
60|$|The {{stranger}} {{stared at}} him for a moment, again looked carefully round the room, and then suddenly dropped his head back on the pillow, and with his white hands over his <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> mouth <b>tried</b> to restrain a spasm of silent laughter. After an effort he succeeded, wiped his moist <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> sat up.|$|R
60|$|I don't {{often go}} to the theatre, but when I do I {{like one of those}} plays with some ginger in them which the papers {{generally}} cuss. The papers say that real human beings don't carry on in that way. Take it from me, mister, they do. I seen a feller on the stage read a letter once which didn't just suit him; and he gasped and rolled his <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> to say something and couldn't, and had to get a hold on a chair to keep him from falling. There was a piece in the paper saying that this was all wrong, and that he wouldn't of done them things in real life. Believe me, the paper was wrong. There wasn't a thing that feller did that Andy didn't do when he read that letter.|$|E
60|$|I {{turned and}} crept to where Tota lay {{by the side}} of Indaba-zimbi. It was {{impossible}} to say if they were dead or swooning. The lady sprinkled Tota's face with the water, which I watched greedily, for my thirst was still awful, while the woman Hendrika did the same office for Indaba-zimbi. Presently, to my vast delight, Tota opened her <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> to cry, but could not, poor little thing, because her tongue and lips were so swollen. But the lady got some water into her mouth, and, as in my case, the effect was magical. We allowed her to drink {{about a quarter of a}} pint, and no more, though she cried bitterly for it. Just then old Indaba-zimbi came to with a groan. He opened his eyes, glanced round, and took in the situation.|$|E
60|$|At first, when {{he opened}} his eyes, he fancied, from the sound of water in his ears, that it must have come on to rain very heavily, but, being {{regardless}} of rain, he tried to fall asleep again. Then he felt as if there must be a leak in his berth somewhere, he was so wet; but, being sleepy, he shut his <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> to shut his senses against moisture. Not succeeding, he resolved to turn on his other side, but experienced a strange resistance to that effort. Waxing testy, he wrenched himself round, and in so doing kicked out somewhat impatiently. This, of course, woke him up to the real state of the case. It also awoke Slagg, who received the kick on his shins. He, delivering a cry of pain straight into Sam Shipton's ear, caused that youth to fling out his fist, which fell on Stumps's nose, and thus in rapid succession were the sleepers roused effectually to a full sense of their condition.|$|E
5000|$|The Morcombe family {{started the}} [...] "Daniel Morcombe Foundation", and put its {{resources}} into keeping Morcombe's disappearance {{in the public}} <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> {{to find out what}} happened to their son. The foundation is committed to educating children about personal safety and to raising awareness throughout Australia of the dangers of predatory criminals. These efforts are supported by the Australian media, especially on each anniversary of Morcombe's disappearance when a [...] "Day for Daniel" [...] is held to promote awareness of the vulnerability of children. An accompanying event is the [...] "Ride for Daniel", which covers 50 km of the Sunshine Coast, held each year since 2005.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no, dear, you haven't. You {{are always}} full of consideration. But I have noticed it with mother, {{and with others}} also. The husband pulls out his {{cheque-book}} {{at the end of}} the week or month, and he says, [...] "Well, this is rather more than we can afford," [...] or [...] "This is less than I expected," [...] but he never really takes any interest in his wife's efforts to keep things nice on a little. He does not see it with her <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> to realise her difficulties. Oh, I wish I could express myself better, but I know that the interest is one- sided.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And to give it," [...] he added, {{bending down}} to her. The supreme {{quality of its}} essence was still to be doubted, a bright star-dust which dazzled him, to {{evaporate}} before his waking <b>eyes.</b> <b>And,</b> <b>try</b> as he would, he could not realize to the full depth the boy of contact with a being whom, by discipline, he had trained his mind to look upon as the unattainable. They had spoken of the future, yet in these moments any consideration of it was blotted out... It was only by degrees that he collected himself sufficiently {{to be able to}} return to it... Alison took up the thread.|$|R
