40|$|Aim: The present {{research}} work was undertaken {{to study the}} diagnostic importance of hematobiochemical changes in naturally occurring <b>ehrlichiosis</b> in <b>dogs</b> <b>of</b> Anand region, Gujarat irrespective of their age, breed, and sex. Materials and Methods: Blood samples from a total <b>of</b> 29 <b>dogs</b> <b>of</b> Anand region of Gujarat state were screened for detection of anti-Ehrlichia canis antibodies using Immunocomb® rapid diagnostic kit (Biogal Galed Laboratories, Israel) and subjected to estimation of hematobiochemical parameters by auto hematology analyzers at College of Veterinary Science and Animal Husbandry, Anand. Statistical analysis, interpretation and comparison of hematobiochemical changes with scientific literature {{was carried out in}} order to understand the pathophysiology of the disease. Results: <b>Of</b> 29 <b>dogs,</b> 18 were positive for naturally occurring ehrlichiosis based on the presence of anti-E. canis antibodies while 11 were negative. Haematology evinced that the mean values of hemoglobin, total erythrocyte counts, platelet count and packed cell volume in dogs with ehrlichiosis decreased significantly (p 0. 05) difference was observed in values <b>of</b> monocytes in <b>dogs</b> with ehrlichiosis and healthy dogs. Among various red blood cells indices, the mean values of mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration increased significantly (p< 0. 01) in dogs with ehrlichiosis in comparison to healthy dogs. Serum biochemistry revealed significant (p< 0. 01) increase in serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and creatinine levels as well as decrease in total protein levels in dogs with ehrlichiosis as compared to healthy dogs. Conclusion: Clinical importance of hematobiochemical changes in 18 natural cases <b>of</b> <b>ehrlichiosis</b> in <b>dogs</b> <b>of</b> Anand region, Gujarat irrespective of their age, breed and sex is discussed, which would aid new insights in diagnosis and therapeutic management...|$|R
40|$|Este trabalho foi realizado com o objetivo de traçar o perfil clínico e laboratorial para o diagnóstico da erliquiose canina. Utilizaram-se 75 cães, de ambos os sexos, diferentes idades e raças, da cidade de Salvador e região metropolitana, Bahia, incluídos na pesquisa a partir da suspeita clínica e por apresentar infestação de carrapatos ou histórico de exposição prévia ao vetor. Anticorpos anti-Ehrlichia canis foram encontrados em 98, 66 % (74 / 75) dos animais. A PCR foi positiva em 33, 3 % (25 / 75) dos cães, enquanto a presença de mórulas foi positiva em 5, 33 % (4 / 75) dos suspeitos. Nos animais com PCR (Reação da Polimerase em Cadeia) positivo, febre, desidratação, mucosas hipocoradas e petéquias em membranas mucosas ou na pele e anemia, leucopenia, neutropenia, eosinopenia, linfopenia e trombocitopenia foram os sinais clínicos e laboratoriais estatisticamente significantes (p< 0, 05) mais freqüentemente encontrados. Canine Ehrlichiosis {{despite its}} high morbidy is an illness of great {{importance}} in the medical clinic of small animals. The great difficulty for the definitive diagnosis of this disease consists of the little use of more sensible and specific tests considering the clinical signals and more frequent hematological results as exclusive of the illness. This research aimed to provide the clinical-laboratorial profile in the diagnosis <b>of</b> canine <b>ehrlichiosis</b> <b>of</b> 75 <b>dogs,</b> <b>of</b> both sexes, at different ages and races, from Salvador and metropolitan region, Bahia state. The evaluated animals were dogs with clinical suspicion <b>of</b> <b>Ehrlichiosis</b> and tick infestation or description of previous exposition to that vector. Antibodies anti- E. canis were found in 98. 66 % (74 / 75) of the animals. The PCR was positive in 33. 3 % (25 / 75) <b>of</b> the <b>dogs,</b> while the presence of inclusions (morulae) was observed in 5. 33 % (4 / 75) of the suspected animals. Fever, dehydration, pale mucous membranes, petechiae of skin and mucous membranes; and anemia, leucopoenia, neutropenia, eosinopenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia were the most significant (p< 0. 05) clinical and laboratory indicators found in animals with positive PCR...|$|R
40|$|Canine {{ehrlichiosis}} is a zoonotic rickettsial disease {{transmitted by}} ticks. In the present study, 198 companion <b>dogs</b> <b>of</b> different ages were examined for serum antibody detection against Ehrlichia canis {{by means of}} immunochromatography assay. The dogs were selected among referred cases to Veterinary Hospital of Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz, Southwestern Iran from November 2008 to March 2010. The studied dogs were classified based on age, sex, breed, region and season. Nineteen of 198 serum samples (9. 6 %) had antibody against E. canis. Prevalence was significantly higher in adult dogs more than 3 year-old (16. 18 %) (P= 0. 002) and 1 – 3 years (11. 86 %) (P= 0. 016) compared with young dogs less than 1 year-old (1. 41 %). Prevalence was higher in male dogs (10. 62 %) than female dogs (8. 24 %), in the summer (11. 32 %) and west region (11. 11 %). There were not {{significant differences between the}} prevalence of infection and host gender, season and region (P> 0. 05). Typical morulae of E. canis were observed in monocytes <b>of</b> four infected <b>dogs</b> (2. 02 %). Five out of 24 (20. 83 %) <b>of</b> the thrombocytopenic <b>dogs</b> and 14 out of 174 (8. 05 %) <b>of</b> the non-thrombocytopenic <b>dogs</b> were positive for <b>ehrlichiosis.</b> <b>Of</b> 19 seropositive <b>dogs,</b> six (31. 58 %) had anemia, four (21. 05 %) hypoalbuminemia and five (26. 32 %) leukopenia. There were not statistically significant differences between hematological findings and prevalence of infection (P> 0. 05). This is the first report indicating the presence of E. canis in companion <b>dogs</b> <b>of</b> Ahvaz district. However, the sources of infection in these dogs were not clear. Finally, the role <b>of</b> companion <b>dogs</b> in the epizootiology of E. canis infection needs to be further explored...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{describes}} a retrospective study of clinical cases <b>of</b> <b>ehrlichiosis</b> in <b>dogs</b> examined from March 1998 to September 2001. From the clinical records with laboratorial confirmation of Ehrlichia canis or E. platys infections, the following parameters were analyzed: demographic aspects (age, race, sex, {{period of the}} year and origin), clinical characteristics (body temperature, exposure to ticks and clinical signs), and hematological characteristics (blood cell counts and type of infected cell). A total of 194 clinical records were analyzed, from which 31 animals were infected with E. canis and 21 animals with E. platys. The number of cases <b>of</b> canine <b>ehrlichiosis</b> increased considerably from the year 2000 onwards, and 24. 4 % of the cases occurred in 13 - to 24 -month-old animals, in different urban and per-urban regions of the municipality of Belo Horizonte. The most frequent symptoms were fever, anorexia, apathy, abdominal pain, lymphadenopathy and dispnea. Regarding hematological alterations, 70. 3 % of the animals presented anemia, 50 % presented thrombocytopenia and 30 % leukopenia, and most E. canis morulae were seen in monocytes. The results point to the importance <b>of</b> canine <b>ehrlichiosis,</b> as 35. 9 % <b>of</b> the <b>dogs</b> with suspected hemoparasitic diseases were infected with Ehrlichia canis or E. platys...|$|R
