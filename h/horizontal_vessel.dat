This new type of multiphase reactor consists of a <b>horizontal</b> <b>vessel</b> compartmentalized by vertical baffles and equipped with an impeller in each compartment. The impeller is a donut-shaped foam block, which is also used as catalyst support. The advantage of this reactor configuration compared to batch slurry reactors is the better catalyst handling, since the catalyst is fixed on the stirrer. In addition, a higher selectivity towards the desired product is achieved {{as a result of}} a narrower residence time distribution. A reactor model consisting of stirred tanks in series with backflow and dead volume was used to describe the liquid flow behaviour. The effects of liquid flow rate, backmixing and number of stages for the hydrogenation reaction are discussed, and optimal operation conditions are suggested...|$|E

The adopted solver is an efficient 3 -D numerical Domain-Decomposition strategy for the seakeeping of a 6 -dof vessel without and with small forward speed and possibly subjected to bottom-slamming and water-on-deck events. Here, the vessel has been assumed at rest and the excitation frequency is varied in the first parametric resonance zone and occurrence and features of the instability are examined in terms of nonlinearities of the incident waves and roll natural-to-incident wave frequency ratio. The analysis is performed both fully within the potential-flow theory and examining {{the effect on the}} parametric resonance of the viscous correction to the roll damping obtained from free-decay 3 D model tests on the same ship. A system of four cables, horizontal in the mean configuration, will be used experimentally to limit the <b>horizontal</b> <b>vessel</b> motions.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} the theoretical {{aspects of the}} unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) and try to evaluate their practical value in a dynamic positioning (DP) system. A nonlinear <b>horizontal</b> <b>vessel</b> model is {{used as the basis}} for performing state, disturbance, and parameter estimation, and attempts at controling the vessel using NMPC are made. It is shown that the extended Kalman filter (EKF), which is much used in various navigation applications including DP, is outperformed both theoretically and practically in simulations by the UKF. Much of which is due to the UKF's improved approximation of the estimated system's true stochastic properties. An attempt to estimate the current from the hydrodynamical damping forces have been applied and shown to be working when the vessel is not subjected to other slowly-varying drift forces. It is implemented a dual estimation approach to try to estimate hydrodynamic damping, which is a very real problem for actual vessels and DP systems. A theoretical evaluation of NMPC is performed and it is concluded that NMPC schemes could fulfill a need in vessel control and DP. Its combination of model based control, optimization approach to achieving performance and predictive properties are indeed useful also for DP. It is found that NMPC could be a step towards a unified control approach combining low and high speed reference tracking, station-keeping and several other control operations which today are handled by separate control approaches. NMPC provides the control designer with an exceptional amount of freedom when quantifying the performance, that it is impossible not to find some use for NMPC. </p...|$|E

Total reflectance values over 39 wavelengths are scored {{by the addition of}} simulated light returning to the surface within a specified region and surface reflections (calculated using Fresnel's equations).

40|$|The {{frequent}} use {{of two or more}} closely positioned vessels during offshore operations makes the study of multi-body hydrodynamics an important topic, especially for the design of deepwater offshore systems. This research investigation studies the response behavior of a coupled mini-TLP / barge system in both head and beam sea conditions. The design sea conditions were selected to represent the combined wind, wave and current conditions for a target location off the coast of West Africa. Both the mini-TLP and the barge were designed to have independent mooring systems. Coupling between the two vessels is introduced through a connection consisting of two breast lines and a fender system. This connection is designed to restrain the horizontal movements of the two vessels while keeping a constant distance between them and avoiding collisions. The main focus {{of this study is to}} analyze the experimental data obtained during the model testing, especially the motions of the two bodies and the values related to the fender system, in order to characterize the behavior of the uncoupled and coupled system configurations. A statistical approach is used for the data analysis and interpretation. Statistical parameters are used to provide an overall characterization of system behavior, and Gaussian and Weibull distribution functions are utilized to detect the importance of non-linearity in the data with particular attention to extreme values. Correlations between the two vessels in time domain and frequency domain are investigated. In addition, auto and cross spectrum analyses of the data are used to contrast the motion behavior of the uncoupled and coupled configurations. It is shown that the connection system reduces the <b>horizontal</b> <b>vessel</b> motions; however the forces exerted on the fender system show significant variation depending on sea heading conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{gravitational}} forces and wall thickness on the behaviour {{of a model}} of blood flow through axisymmetric vessels were studied. The governing fluid dynamic equations were derived from the Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible fluid and linked to a simple model of the vessel wall. A closed form of the hyperbolic partial differential equations was found, including a significant source term from the gravitational forces. The inclination of the vessel is modelled using a slope parameter that varied between - 1 and 1. The wave speed was shown {{to be related to}} the wall thickness, and the time to first shock formation was shown to be directly proportional to this thickness. Two non-dimensional parameters were derived for the ratio of gravitational forces to viscous and momentum forces, respectively, and their values were calculated for the different types of vessel found in the human vasculature, showing that gravitational forces were significant in comparison with either viscous or momentum forces for every type of vessel. The steady-state solution of the governing equations showed that gravitational forces cause an increase in area of approximately 5 % per metre per unit slope. Numerical simulations of the flow field in the aorta showed that a positive slope causes a velocity pulse to change in amplitude approximately linearly with distance: - 4 % per metre and + 5 % per metre for vessels inclined vertically upwards and downwards, respectively, in comparison with only + 0. 5 % for a <b>horizontal</b> <b>vessel.</b> These simulations also showed that the change relative to the zero slope condition in the maximum rate of change of area with distance, which was taken to be a measure of the rate of shock formation, is proportional to both the slope and the wall thickness-to-inner radius ratio, with a constant of proportionality of 1. 2. At a ratio of 0. 25, typical of that found in human arteries, the distance to shock formation is thus decreased and increased by 30 % for vessels inclined vertically downwards and upwards, respectively. Gravity and wall thickness thus have a significant impact on a number of aspects of the fluid and wall behaviour, despite conventionally being neglected...|$|E
40|$|The {{offshore}} wind industry is requesting high annual accessibility to wind-turbines. The turbines are located increasingly {{further from the}} shore. Simultaneously, operations & maintenance costs are to be minimized, therefore innovation is needed for the turbine service vessels which transfer crew and equipment. Surface Effect Ships (SESs) are fast and fuel-efficient when sailing long distances. Active damping of vertical motions means that low motion levels can be achieved even for small vessels in high seas. However, safe interaction with fixed offshore installations necessitates automatic control of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>vessel</b> motions. Such control has never been implemented on a SES before, and was therefore investigated {{for the work of}} this thesis. We derived the necessary dynamics, describing both the horizontal- and vertical states of the plant. Since conventional bow thrusters are hard to fit in SESs we derived a model for the lateral thrust capabilities obtainable by controlling the direction of the out flow from the SES air cushion. To successfully simulate the derived plant for somewhat realistic conditions, the model was augmented to include the effects of environmental disturbances. The control problem was dual: While the main objective was to investigate the possibilities for dynamic positioning of the plant. Due to the fast dynamics of the air cushion actuators, we also wanted to check the potential for damping of horizontal and vertical, 1 st order wave induced motions. The latter controller was derived by an augmentation and slight alteration of an already existing control scheme based on optimal control, while the former was a simple PID controller solely intended to prove the potential of dynamic positioning of the derived plant. Due to large levels of saturation and mutually inflicting control desires, much care was given in ensuring that the phases of the wave frequency motion damping control signals where tuned to minimize the degree of infliction. The simulations show strong performance of the controllers, while the derived model seems to provide accurate indications regarding the behaviour of the real plant. For moderate sea states, we obtained almost 80 % damping of the heave motions while we reduced the wave frequency motions in sway by as much as 50 %. The two wave frequency controllers was also run simultaneously, where the controller achieved a damping in sway and heave of 32 - and 60 %, respectively, for 0. 5 m high waves. The DP controller also performed well, and the vessel seemed to maintain position, by the means of water jets and airflow thrust, in 15 m/s wind, 1 m/s current and regular waves of 2 m. We also performed simultaneous station keeping and vertical motion damping, which revealed a strong dependency between the airflow thrust demand and heave compensation capacity of the vessel, but still indicated that such simultaneous operation was indeed possible...|$|E
40|$|Background/Objectives: Reflectance {{confocal}} microscopy (RCM) can {{accurately and}} non-invasively diagnose {{basal cell carcinoma}} (BCC). The use of RCM in assessing responses to saucerization or curettage and cautery of BCC has not been established. The aim {{of the present study}} was to expound the usefulness of RCM in assessing treatment responses of BCC to saucerization or curettage and cautery 8 - 12 weeks after treatment. Methods: Eight sequential patients, with 11 superficial BCCs, were recruited. Lesions were evaluated clinically and dermoscopically. Three operators performed RCM imaging for each BCC at baseline and 8 - 12 weeks after treatment. Diagnostic criteria for RCM diagnosis included streaming of basal cells and the presence of cord-like structures and <b>horizontal</b> <b>vessels.</b> Results were compared against histopathology. Difficulties in establishing tumour clearance were identified and the effectiveness of RCM in assessing the response to treatment was explored. Results: At baseline, all lesions were consistent with superficial BCC. At 8 - 12 weeks after treatment, RCM correctly diagnosed 10 of 11 lesions as tumour free. Furthermore, RCM was reliable across operators of variable experience and the findings were confirmed histopathologically. Limitations were identified, but appeared to be related to operator experience. Conclusion: The diagnosis of BCC was straightforward and reliable in the present study. Thus, RCM appears useful in assessing the early treatment response of superficial BCC treated with saucerization or curettage and cautery despite operator-dependant limitations. © 2011 The Authors.

Some early retorts were little more than iron vessels filled with coal and thrust upon a coal fire with pipes attached to their top ends.

As the size of such vessels grew - the need became apparent for efficiency in refilling retorts - and it was apparent that filling one-ended vertical retorts was easy; removing the coke and residues from them after the carbonization of coal was far more difficult.
