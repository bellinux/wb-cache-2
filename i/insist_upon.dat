5|$|In United States v. Marchant (1827), the Court held thateven {{though a}} trial court has the {{discretion}} to sever {{the trials of}} co-defendantsa defendant {{has no right to}} <b>insist</b> <b>upon</b> being tried alone. The Court recounted the history of criminal severance in English law, and concluded that the practice merely arose to prevent co-defendants from each using their peremptory challenges to deplete the venire such that too few jurors remained for trial. Justice Story was the author of the opinion of the Court, as well as a substantially similar opinion in the Massachusetts circuit court below.|$|E
5|$|On 22 July, {{a council}} {{was held in}} the Church of the Holy Sepulchre to {{establish}} a king for the newly created Kingdom of Jerusalem. Raymond of Toulouse at first refused to become king, perhaps attempting to show his piety, but probably hoping that the other nobles would <b>insist</b> <b>upon</b> his election anyway. Godfrey, who had become the more popular of the two after Raymond's actions at the siege of Antioch, did no damage to his own piety by accepting a position as secular leader. Raymond was incensed at this development and took his army out into the countryside.|$|E
5|$|Psychiatry {{possesses}} {{an inherent}} capacity for abuse that {{is greater than}} {{in other areas of}} medicine. The diagnosis of mental disease can give the state license to detain persons against their will and <b>insist</b> <b>upon</b> therapy both {{in the interest of the}} detainee and in the broader interests of society. In addition, receiving a psychiatric diagnosis can in itself be regarded as oppressive. In a monolithic state, psychiatry can be used to bypass standard legal procedures for establishing guilt or innocence and allow political incarceration without the ordinary odium attaching to such political trials.|$|E

Every {{element of the}} Pugin building is true, true to structure, to function, to material, to a religious meaning; above all, true to itself, its own isolable reality'.|$|R
25|$|Troelstra was {{inclusive}} in his outlook. As {{leader of}} the parliamentary faction of the SDAP, he did not <b>insist</b> <b>upon</b> a tight party line. That permitted a period of harmony within the SDAP between 1894 and 1900.|$|E
25|$|While the war {{was being}} planned, Hitler never insisted upon the Luftwaffe {{planning}} a strategic bombing campaign and did not even give ample warning to the air staff, that war with Britain or even Russia was a possibility. The amount of firm operational and tactical preparation for a bombing campaign was minimal, {{largely because of the}} failure by Hitler as supreme commander to <b>insist</b> <b>upon</b> such a commitment.|$|E

Both seek a distinctive path for India, both reject the materialism of socialism and capitalism alike, both reject the individualism of modern society {{in favor of a}} holistic, varna-dharma based community, both <b>insist</b> <b>upon</b> an infusion of religious and moral values in politics, and both seek a culturally authentic mode of modernization that preserves Hindu values.|$|E

25|$|The Church is unwavering in {{upholding}} its dogmatic teachings, {{but does}} not <b>insist</b> <b>upon</b> those matters of faith which have not been specifically defined. The Eastern Orthodox believe that there must always be room for mystery when speaking of God. Individuals are permitted to hold theologoumena (private theological opinions) {{so long as they}} do not contradict traditional Eastern Orthodox teaching. Sometimes, various Holy Fathers may have contradictory opinions about a certain question, and where no consensus exists, the individual is free to follow his or her conscience.|$|E
25|$|After the Greek delegation, led by Mavrocordatos, {{accepted}} {{the terms of}} the treaty, the Allies prepared to <b>insist</b> <b>upon</b> the armistice, and their fleets were instructed to intercept supplies destined for Ibrahim's forces. When Mehmet Ali's fleet, which had been warned by the British and French to stay away from Greece, left Alexandria and joined other Ottoman/Egyptian units at Navarino on 8 September, Codrington arrived with his squadron off Navarino on 12 September. On 13 October, Codrington was joined, off Navarino, by his allied support, a French squadron under De Rigny and a Russian squadron under L. Heyden.|$|E
25|$|Psychiatrists {{around the}} world have been {{involved}} in the suppression of individual rights by states wherein the definitions of mental disease had been expanded to include political disobedience. Nowadays, in many countries, political prisoners are sometimes confined to mental institutions and abused therein. Psychiatry possesses a built-in capacity for abuse which is greater than in other areas of medicine. The diagnosis of mental disease can serve as proxy for the designation of social dissidents, allowing the state to hold persons against their will and to <b>insist</b> <b>upon</b> therapies that work in favour of ideological conformity and in the broader interests of society.|$|E

25|$|From early on, Moynier and Dunant had {{increasing}} disagreements {{and conflicts}} regarding their respective visions and plans. Moynier considered Dunant's idea to establish neutrality protections for care providers unfeasible and advised Dunant not to <b>insist</b> <b>upon</b> this concept. However, Dunant continued to advocate this position in his travels and conversations with high-ranking {{political and military}} figures. This intensified the personal conflict between Moynier, who took a rather pragmatic approach to the project, and Dunant, who was the visionary idealist among the five, and led to efforts by Moynier to attack Dunant and his bid for leadership.|$|E
25|$|This Society was {{incorporated}} {{for the purpose}} of promoting artistic work in all branches of handicraft. It hopes to bring Designers and Workmen into mutually helpful relations, and to encourage workmen to execute designs of their own. It endeavors to stimulate in workmen an appreciation of the dignity and value of good design; to counteract the popular impatience of Law and Form, and the desire for over-ornamentation and specious originality. It will <b>insist</b> <b>upon</b> the necessity of sobriety and restraint, or ordered arrangement, of due regard for the relation between the form of an object and its use, and of harmony and fitness in the decoration put upon it.|$|E
25|$|Akram {{made his}} Test cricket debut for Pakistan against New Zealand in 1985, {{and in his}} second Test match, he claimed 10 wickets. A few weeks prior to his {{selection}} into the Pakistan team, he was an unknown club cricketer who had failed to make it even to his college team. He came to the trials at Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore in Pakistan, {{but for the first}} two days he did not get a chance to bowl. On the third day, he got a chance; his performance convincing Javed Miandad to <b>insist</b> <b>upon</b> his inclusion in the national team. Akram was hence given an opportunity to play for Pakistan, without any significant domestic experience.|$|E

25|$|Two and a {{half years}} after Sin's death, it was {{reported}} that at the height of EDSA II, Sin received a directive from the Vatican ordering him and the Philippine clergy to adopt a non-partisan stance towards the political crisis. Sin, who by then had committed support for the EDSA II revolt, was said to have threatened to resign as archbishop if compelled to withdraw his support. The standoff was reportedly resolved with the mediation of the then Supreme Court Associate Justice Artemio Panganiban (later, Chief Justice of the Philippines), a member of the Pontifical Council for the Laity, a department of the Roman Curia. As a result, the Vatican did not <b>insist</b> <b>upon</b> its earlier demand. The reports were attributed to persons reputed to have first-hand knowledge of the events, but there has been no official confirmation of them from the Vatican or from the Archdiocese of Manila.|$|E
500|$|Reverend Samuel Bishop (1731–95) was a poet, {{headmaster}} of Merchant Taylors' {{school and}} rector of Ditton. His posthumously published book entitled Poems (1796) was much admired and several times reprinted. Not everyone was complimentary about Bishop and his verses: [...] "the character of Bishop's countenance {{is not very}} intellectual, {{and there is a}} timid, and almost mean expression about the mouth. He looks but little qualified to <b>insist</b> <b>upon</b> the discipline necessary to be observed at Merchant Tailor's (sic) school, or to wield the weapons of Dr. Busby. But, we suppose, he did both occasionally, besides writing his epigrams, and composing verses to his wife, — [...] "To Mrs. Bishop." [...] Of this lady he sings sometimes more like the tea-kettle than the nightingale".|$|E
500|$|Davies {{found himself}} again {{at odds with}} his party, {{over the issue of}} Welsh self-government. He had championed this cause for many years, to the {{annoyance}} of Labour's Welsh Regional Council. In May 1954 he offered proposals for a Welsh parliament that were rejected by the Regional Council and by the South Wales Area conference of the NUM. Davies persevered, and on 4 March 1955 introduced in the House of Commons a private member's bill proposing self-government for Wales {{on the basis of the}} aborted 1914 act that would have granted home rule to Ireland. Davies claimed to have received thousands of messages of support for his measure, from all parts of Wales, but in the House he could only muster 14 votes in favour. Undeterred, he told MPs: [...] "There is a movement in Wales, an uprising, as it were, that will not only support the bill but will continue to <b>insist</b> <b>upon</b> it until Wales is represented in the United Kingdom as something more than a mere region." ...|$|E

500|$|In Palm Beach, {{about fifty}} men shoveled sand off Ocean Boulevard {{and cut down}} damaged palm trees with {{crosscut}} saws. On September19, then-Mayor of West Palm Beach Vincent Oaksmith issued a [...] "no work, no food" [...] order, effectively stating that all able-boded men should work toward relief efforts. The Delray Beach City Council issued a similar order. Initially, rebuilding in West Palm Beach was slow. City Manager A. E. Parker issued a public notice that stated [...] "Because of the grave emergency now existing and the great need for shelter, {{it has not been}} deemed wise to <b>insist</b> <b>upon</b> building permits for necessary repairs." [...] Many severely damaged buildings were declared [...] "public menaces" [...] and condemned for demolition, effective on October23. On September20, the West Palm Beach City Commission held a special session that allowed the City Treasurer to authorize an in advance requisition payment of $50,000 to the Red Cross. Also on the agenda was an anti-price gauging measure, which would fine individuals up to $500 and imprison them for a maximum of 30days if they sold items above the pre-September16 price.|$|E
500|$|Many of the {{political}} subtleties of the Second Settlement seem to have evaded the comprehension of the Plebeian class, who were Augustus' greatest supporters and clientele. This caused them to <b>insist</b> <b>upon</b> Augustus' participation in imperial affairs from time to time. Augustus failed to stand for election as consul in 22BC, and fears arose once again {{that he was being}} forced from power by the aristocratic Senate. In 22, 21, and 19BC, the people rioted in response, and only allowed a single consul to be elected for each of those years, ostensibly to leave the other position open for Augustus. Likewise, there was a food shortage in Rome in 22BC which sparked panic, while many urban plebs called for Augustus to take on dictatorial powers to personally oversee the crisis. After a theatrical display of refusal before the Senate, Augustus finally accepted authority over Rome's grain supply [...] "by virtue of his proconsular imperium", and ended the crisis almost immediately. It was not until AD 8 that a food crisis of this sort prompted Augustus to establish a praefectus annonae, a permanent prefect {{who was in charge of}} procuring food supplies for Rome.|$|E
500|$|Michael Billington {{was charged}} in a Roanoke court with having knowingly {{solicited}} 131 loans {{that would never}} be repaid from 85 people, totaling $1.24million. Represented by a court-appointed lawyer, he rejected a plea bargain that would have limited his prison sentence to the three years he had already served in the federal case. The lawyer, Brian Gettings, doubted Billington's competence and told the court that he believed LaRouche was making the decisions in the case rather than his client. The court ordered two psychiatric tests. The first physician deemed him competent. Billington refused to cooperate with a second examination {{that was to be}} conducted by an expert on cults. Billington sought to fire Gettings, who had already tried to quit over competency question, but the judge refused to permit Billington to substitute a different attorney. A LaRouche spokesman said that Billington was prepared for trial. [...] Billington was convicted on nine counts of [...] "conspiracy to fail to register as a securities broker". Under Virginia's court system, the jury determines prison terms although a judge may override the jury's recommendation. The jury in this case recommended 77 years (out of a possible 90); the judge refused to lower it because Billington continued to <b>insist</b> <b>upon</b> his innocence (which the judge deemed lack of remorse) and because he had warned that he would accept the jury recommendation if Billington requested a jury trial. Billington served a total of ten years in prison before being released on parole. The lead prosecutor said the case involved [...] "willful and massive fraud that has caused {{a lot of people to}} suffer".|$|E
