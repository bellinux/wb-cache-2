5|$|In RRMS {{they are}} {{modestly}} effective at decreasing {{the number of}} attacks. The interferons and glatiramer acetate are first-line treatments and are roughly equivalent, reducing relapses by approximately 30%. Early-initiated long-term therapy is safe and improves outcomes. Natalizumab reduces the relapse rate more than first-line agents; however, due to issues of adverse effects is a second-line agent reserved <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not respond to other treatments or with severe disease. Mitoxantrone, whose use is limited by severe adverse effects, is a third-line option <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not respond to other medications. Treatment of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) with interferons decreases the chance of progressing to clinical MS. Efficacy of interferons and glatiramer acetate in children has been estimated to be roughly equivalent to that of adults. The role of some newer agents such as fingolimod, teriflunomide, and dimethyl fumarate, as of 2011, is not yet entirely clear.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} the disease include not having sex or having few sexual {{partners}} and using condoms. Screening women at risk for chlamydial infection followed by treatment decreases the risk of PID. If the diagnosis is suspected, treatment is typically advised. Treating a woman's sexual partners should also occur. In those with mild or moderate symptoms a single injection of the antibiotic ceftriaxone along with two weeks of doxycycline and possibly metronidazole by mouth is recommended. <b>For</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not improve after three days or who have severe disease intravenous antibiotics should be used.|$|E
5|$|The {{costs of}} these {{provisions}} are offset by taxes, fees, and cost-saving measures, {{such as new}} Medicare taxes for those in high-income brackets, taxes on indoor tanning, cuts to the Medicare Advantage program in favor of traditional Medicare, and fees on medical devices and pharmaceutical companies; {{there is also a}} tax penalty <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not obtain health insurance, unless they are exempt due to low income or other reasons.

5|$|Initial {{management}} with non–medication based treatments is recommended. NSAIDs {{are recommended}} {{if these are}} not sufficiently effective. Normal activity should be continued {{as much as the}} pain allows. Medications are recommended for the duration that they are helpful. A number of other options are available <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not improve with usual treatment. Opioids may be useful if simple pain medications are not enough, but they are not generally recommended due to side effects. Surgery may be beneficial for those with disc-related chronic pain and disability or spinal stenosis. No clear benefit has been found for other cases of non-specific low back pain. Low back pain often affects mood, which may be improved by counseling or antidepressants. Additionally, there are many alternative medicine therapies, including the Alexander technique and herbal remedies, but there is not enough evidence to recommend them confidently. The evidence for chiropractic care and spinal manipulation is mixed.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} if {{among those with}} non-chronic back pain {{alternative}} treatments are useful. For chiropractic care or spinal manipulation therapy (SMT) it is unclear if it improves outcomes {{more or less than}} other treatments. Some reviews find that SMT results in equal or better improvements in pain and function when compared with other commonly used interventions for short, intermediate, and long-term follow-up; other reviews find it to be no more effective in reducing pain than either inert interventions, sham manipulation, or other treatments, and conclude that adding SMT to other treatments does improve outcomes. National guidelines reach different conclusions, with some not recommending spinal manipulation, some describing manipulation as optional, and others recommending a short course <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not improve with other treatments. A 2017 review recommended spinal manipulation based on low quality evidence. Manipulation under anaesthesia, or medically assisted manipulation, has not enough evidence to make any confident recommendation.|$|E
5|$|The A9, {{the great}} road {{connecting}} Edinburgh with Inverness {{and the far}} north, once ran through Evanton, {{on the path of}} Balconie Street. However, a bypass was created as part of a general scheme to shorten the journey between Inverness to Invergordon. This reduced the amount of traffic going through the village, but decreased the revenue available to local businesses. The road also cut through much of the farmland of the zone, distorting the shape of the fields. This was compounded by the closure of the filling station in the village. <b>For</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not have cars, the only means of transport is either by foot or by the #25 bus service operated by Stagecoach. Recently, the express service running from Inverness to Dornoch began to stop in Evanton. Now residents can travel from and to Inverness without the long diversion through Dingwall, making it easier to work in the city of Inverness without personal transport.|$|E

30|$|However, now {{consider}} <b>those</b> women <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not work before migrating. The selection argument outlined above implies that nonparticipants {{from a high}} female labor supply country would be more negatively selected than nonparticipants from a low female labor supply country. So selection could not explain why we find an especially large positive effect of source country female labor supply <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not work prior to migrating.

40|$|Using {{data from}} the Survey of Ontario Workers with Permanent Impairments (1989 – 90), the authors {{examine the effects of}} work-related disabilities on the wage losses of {{disabled}} male workers.

The authors also estimate the longer-term persistence of wage shocks for disabled workers. The estimates suggest that wage losses were larger for disabled workers <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not return to work with their time-of-accident employer than <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> return, with the latter earning 27 % more.
