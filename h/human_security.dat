5|$|A {{study by}} the RAND Corporation in 2005 found the UN to be {{successful}} in two out of three peacekeeping efforts. It compared efforts at nation-building by the UN to those of the United States, and found that seven out of eight UN cases are at peace, as compared with four out of eight US cases at peace. Also in 2005, the <b>Human</b> <b>Security</b> Report documented a {{decline in the number of}} wars, genocides, and human rights abuses since the end of the Cold War, and presented evidence, albeit circumstantial, that international activism—mostly spearheaded by the UN—has been the main cause of the decline in armed conflict in that period. Situations in which the UN has not only acted to keep the peace but also intervened include the Korean War (1950–53) and the authorization of intervention in Iraq after the Gulf War (1990–91).|$|E
25|$|The {{nature of}} the {{relationship}} between <b>human</b> <b>security</b> and human rights is contested among <b>human</b> <b>security</b> advocates. Some <b>human</b> <b>security</b> advocates argue that the goal of <b>human</b> <b>security</b> should be to build upon and strengthen the existing global human rights legal framework. However, other advocates view the human rights legal framework as part of the global insecurity problem and believe that a <b>human</b> <b>security</b> approach should propel us to move above and beyond this legalistic approach to get at the underlying sources of inequality and violence which are the root causes of insecurity in today's world.|$|E
25|$|Richard Jolly and Deepayan Basu Ray, {{in their}} UNDP report, {{suggest that the}} key criticisms of <b>human</b> <b>security</b> include: <b>Human</b> <b>security</b> {{does not have any}} {{definite}} boundaries, therefore anything and everything could be considered a risk to security. This makes the task of policy formulation nearly impossible; <b>Human</b> <b>security,</b> when broadened to include issues like climate change and health, complicates the international machinery for reaching decisions or taking action on the threats identified; <b>Human</b> <b>security</b> risks engaging the military in issues best tackled through non-military means; <b>Human</b> <b>security</b> under the UN risks raising hopes about the UN’s capacity, which it cannot fulfil.|$|E

25|$|Coined in {{the early}} 1990s, the term <b>human</b> <b>security</b> {{has been used by}} thinkers who have sought to shift the {{discourse}} on security away from its traditional state-centered orientation to the protection and advancement of individuals within societies. <b>Human</b> <b>security</b> emerged as a challenge to ideas of traditional security, but human and traditional or national security are not mutually exclusive concepts. It has been argued that, without <b>human</b> <b>security,</b> traditional state security cannot be attained and vice versa.|$|E

25|$|In several senses {{there is}} a natural fit between <b>human</b> <b>security</b> {{concepts}} and humanitarian principles. The concern with the protection of people or individuals is a core humanitarian value as well as of <b>human</b> <b>security.</b> In this sense it shares human security’s merging of development and security and the casting of the protection of life as the referent object.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} <b>human</b> <b>security</b> has {{developed}} {{out of the}} precepts put forth by the United Nations, wherein there has been critique of Human Security's focus on what is deemed acceptable behaviors. <b>Human</b> <b>security</b> perspectives view practices such as child marriage and female genital mutilation {{as a threat to}} human (more specifically women) security and well-being in the Global North, while it is more common that these events occur predominately in the Global Southern states. Thus it is seen by states with a traditional <b>human</b> <b>security</b> outlook, to see it as their duty to intervene and perpetuate this eurocentric ideal of what <b>human</b> <b>security</b> looks like, and what is best to protect the familiar concept of women. This can be seen as an infringement on the traditional practices found within some sovereign states of the Global South, and a threat to ways of life and processes of development.|$|E

Performance during a stress but not a neutral prime condition was associated with response in bilateral amygdalae. Furthermore, levels of activity within bilateral amygdalae were highly positively correlated with attachment insecurity and autonomic response during the stress prime condition.

25|$|The report {{illustrates}} {{the usefulness of}} the <b>human</b> <b>security</b> approach, particularly its ability to examine the cause of conflicts that explain and justify humanitarian intervention. In addition, it could also act as a paradigm for identifying, prioritizing and resolving large transnational problems, one of the fundamental factors that act as a stimulus for humanitarian intervention in the first place. However, <b>human</b> <b>security</b> still faces difficulties concerning the scope of its applicability, as large problems requiring humanitarian intervention usually are built up from an array of socio-political, cultural and economic problems that may be beyond the limitations of humanitarian projects. On the other hand, successful examples of the use of <b>human</b> <b>security</b> principles within interventions can be found.|$|E

25|$|<b>Human</b> <b>security</b> is {{indebted to}} the human rights {{tradition}} (the ideas of natural law and natural rights). The development of the <b>human</b> <b>security</b> model {{can be seen to}} have drawn upon ideas and concepts fundamental to the human rights tradition. Both approaches use the individual as the main referent and both argue that {{a wide range of issues}} (i.e. civil rights, cultural identity, access to education and healthcare) are fundamental to human dignity. A major difference between the two models is in their approach to addressing threats to human dignity and survival. Whilst the human rights framework takes a legalistic approach, the <b>human</b> <b>security</b> framework, by utilizing a diverse range of actors, adopts flexible and issue-specific approaches, which can operate at local, national or international levels.|$|E
