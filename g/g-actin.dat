25|$|Cellular actin has two forms: monomeric {{globules}} called <b>G-actin</b> and polymeric filaments called F-actin (that is, as filaments {{made up of}} many <b>G-actin</b> monomers). F-actin {{can also}} {{be described as a}} microfilament.|$|E
25|$|The {{growth of}} actin {{filaments}} can be regulated by thymosin and profilin. Thymosin binds to <b>G-actin</b> to buffer the polymerizing process, while profilin binds to <b>G-actin</b> to exchange ADP for ATP, promoting the monomeric {{addition to the}} barbed, plus end of F-actin filaments.|$|E
25|$|Latrunculin is a toxin {{produced}} by sponges, it binds to <b>G-actin</b> preventing it from binding with microfilaments.|$|E
25|$|Nucleating {{factors are}} {{necessary}} to stimulate actin polymerization. One such nucleating factor is the Arp2/3 complex, which mimics a <b>G-actin</b> dimer in order to stimulate the nucleation (or formation of the first trimer) of monomeric <b>G-actin.</b> The Arp2/3 complex binds to actin filaments at 70 degrees to form new actin branches off existing actin filaments. Arp2/3-mediated nucleation is necessary for directed cell migration. Also, actin filaments themselves bind ATP, and hydrolysis of this ATP stimulates destabilization of the polymer.|$|E
25|$|A S1 {{fragment}} {{is composed}} {{of the head and}} neck domains of myosin II. Under physiological conditions, <b>G-actin</b> (the monomer form) is transformed to F-actin (the polymer form) by ATP, where the role of ATP is essential.|$|E
25|$|Thymosin β-4 is a 5 kDa {{protein that}} can bind with G-actin-ATP in a 1:1 stoichiometry; {{which means that}} one unit of {{thymosin}} β-4 binds to one unit of <b>G-actin.</b> Its role is to impede the incorporation of the monomers into the growing polymer.|$|E
25|$|The X-ray {{crystallography}} {{model of}} actin that {{was produced by}} Kabsch from the striated muscle tissue of rabbits is {{the most commonly used}} in structural studies as it was the first to be purified. The <b>G-actin</b> crystallized by Kabsch is approximately 67 x 40 x 37 Å in size, has a molecular mass of 41,785 Da and an estimated isoelectric point of 4.8. Its net charge at pH = 7 is -7.|$|E
25|$|Reproduction {{is usually}} sexual, though hermaphrodites {{are capable of}} self-fertilization. Males are usually smaller than females/ hermaphrodites (often much smaller) and often have a {{characteristically}} bent or fan-shaped tail. During copulation, one or more chitinized spicules {{move out of the}} cloaca and are inserted into the genital pore of the female. Amoeboid sperm crawl along the spicule into the female worm. Nematode sperm is thought to be the only eukaryotic cell without the globular protein <b>G-actin.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{bacterial}} cytoskeleton {{may not be}} {{as complex}} as that found in eukaryotes; however, it contains proteins that are highly similar to actin monomers and polymers. The bacterial protein MreB polymerizes into thin non-helical filaments and occasionally into helical structures similar to F-actin. Furthermore, its crystalline structure is very similar to that of <b>G-actin</b> (in terms of its three-dimensional conformation), there are even similarities between the MreB protofilaments and F-actin. The bacterial cytoskeleton also contains the FtsZ proteins, which are similar to tubulin.|$|E
25|$|The actin {{cytoskeleton}} in vivo is {{not exclusively}} composed of actin, other proteins {{are required for}} its formation, continuance and function. These proteins are called actin-binding proteins (ABP) and {{they are involved in}} actin’s polymerization, depolymerization, stability, organisation in bundles or networks, fragmentation and destruction. The diversity of these proteins is such that actin is thought to be the protein that takes part in the greatest number of protein-protein interactions. For example, <b>G-actin</b> sequestering elements exist that impede its incorporation into microfilaments. There are also proteins that stimulate its polymerization or that give complexity to the synthesizing networks.|$|E
25|$|ATP is {{hydrolysed}} relatively rapidly {{just after}} {{the addition of a}} <b>G-actin</b> monomer to the filament. There are two hypotheses regarding how this occurs; the stochastic, which suggests that hydrolysis randomly occurs {{in a manner that is}} in some way influenced by the neighbouring molecules; and the vectoral, which suggests that hydrolysis only occurs adjacent to other molecules whose ATP has already been hydrolysed. In either case, the resulting Pi is not released, it remains for some time noncovalently bound to actin’s ADP, in this way there are three species of actin in a filament: ATP-Actin, ADP+Pi-Actin and ADP-Actin. The amount of each one of these species present in a filament depends on its length and state: as elongation commences the filament has an approximately equal amount of actin monomers bound with ATP and ADP+Pi and a small amount of ADP-Actin at the (-) end. As the stationary state is reached the situation reverses, with ADP present along the majority of the filament and only the area nearest the (+) end containing ADP+Pi and with ATP only present at the tip.|$|E
2500|$|In vitro {{production}} {{takes place}} in a sequential manner: [...] first, there is the [...] "activation phase", when the bonding and exchange of divalent cations occurs in specific places on the <b>G-actin,</b> which is bound to ATP. This produces a conformational change, sometimes called G*-actin or F-actin monomer as it is very similar to the units that are located on the filament. This prepares it for the [...] "nucleation phase", in which the <b>G-actin</b> gives rise to small unstable fragments of F-actin that are able to polymerize. Unstable dimers and trimers are initially formed. The [...] "elongation phase" [...] begins when there are a sufficiently large number of these short polymers. In this phase the filament forms and rapidly grows through the reversible addition of new monomers at both extremes. Finally, a [...] "stationary equilibrium" [...] is achieved where the <b>G-actin</b> monomers are exchanged {{at both ends of the}} microfilament without any change to its total length. In this last phase the [...] "critical concentration Cc" [...] is defined as the ratio between the assembly constant and the dissociation constant for <b>G-actin,</b> where the dynamic for the addition and elimination of dimers and trimers does not produce a change in the microfilament's length. Under normal “in vitro” conditions Cc is 0.1 μM, which means that at higher values polymerization occurs and at lower values depolymerization occurs.|$|E
2500|$|Scanning {{electron}} microscope images indicate that <b>G-actin</b> has a [...] globular structure; however, X-ray crystallography shows {{that each of}} these globules consists of two lobes separated by a cleft. This structure represents the “ATPase fold”, which is a centre of enzymatic catalysis that binds ATP and Mg2+ and hydrolyzes the former to ADP plus phosphate. This fold is a conserved structural motif that is also found in other proteins that interact with triphosphate nucleotides such as hexokinase (an enzyme used in energy metabolism) or in Hsp70 proteins (a protein family that play an important part in protein folding). <b>G-actin</b> is only functional when it contains either ADP or ATP in its cleft but the form that is bound to ATP predominates in cells when actin is present in its free state.|$|E
2500|$|The Arp2/3 {{complex is}} widely {{found in all}} {{eukaryotic}} organisms. It is composed of seven subunits, some of which possess a topology that is clearly related to their biological function: two of the subunits, [...] "ARP2» and [...] "ARP3», have a structure {{similar to that of}} actin monomers. This homology allows both units to act as nucleation agents in the polymerization of <b>G-actin</b> and F-actin. This complex is also required in more complicated processes such as in establishing dendritic structures and also in anastomosis (the reconnection of two branching structures that had previously been joined, such as in blood vessels).|$|E
2500|$|Other {{proteins}} that bind to actin regulate {{the length of}} the microfilaments by cutting them, which gives rise to new active ends for polymerization. For example, if a microfilament with two ends is cut twice, there will be three new microfilaments with six ends. This new situation favors the dynamics of assembly and disassembly. [...] The most notable of these proteins are gelsolin and cofilin. These proteins first achieve a cut by binding to an actin monomer located in the polymer they then change the actin monomer’s conformation while remaining bound to the newly generated (+) end. This has the effect of impeding the addition or exchange of new <b>G-actin</b> subunits. Depolymerization is encouraged as the (-) ends are not linked to any other molecule.|$|E
2500|$|Actin is {{a family}} of {{globular}} multi-functional proteins that form microfilaments. It is found in essentially all eukaryotic cells (the only known exception being nematode sperm), where it may be present at a concentration of over 100 μM. [...] An actin protein's mass is roughly 42-kDa, with a diameter of 4 to 7nm, {{and it is the}} monomeric subunit of two types of filaments in cells: microfilaments, one of the three major components of the cytoskeleton, and thin filaments, part of the contractile apparatus in muscle cells. It can be present as either a free monomer called <b>G-actin</b> (globular) or as part of a linear polymer microfilament called F-actin (filamentous), both of which are essential for such important cellular functions as the mobility and contraction of cells during cell division.|$|E
2500|$|The {{amino acid}} {{sequencing}} of actin {{was completed by}} M. Elzinga and co-workers in 1973. The crystal structure of <b>G-actin</b> was solved in 1990 by Kabsch and colleagues. [...] In the same year, a model for F-actin was proposed by Holmes and colleagues following experiments using co-crystallization with different proteins. The procedure of co-crystallization with different proteins was used repeatedly during the following years, until in 2001 the isolated protein was crystallized along with ADP. However, {{there is still no}} high-resolution X-ray structure of F-actin. The crystallization of F-actin was possible due to the use of a rhodamine conjugate that impedes polymerization by blocking the amino acid cys-374. Christine Oriol-Audit died in the same year that actin was first crystallized but she was the researcher that in 1977 first crystallized actin in the absence of Actin Binding Proteins (ABPs). However, the resulting crystals were too small for the available technology of the time.|$|E
50|$|The {{balance of}} F and <b>G-actin</b> is in a {{constant}} state of flux, which can be attributed to actin treadmilling. Actin treadmilling is the process of turnover of actin filaments where F-actin is rapidly assembled and disassembled. <b>G-actin</b> subunits preferentially add to the barbed end of the F-actin polymer and older units are removed from the pointed end. The concentration of free <b>G-actin</b> monomers decreases until it reaches a critical concentration where the rate of assembly to disassembly or the F to <b>G-actin</b> ratio reaches a steady state.|$|E
50|$|Elongating the actin {{filament}} {{occurs when}} free-actin (<b>G-actin)</b> bound to ATP associates with the filament. Under physiological conditions, {{it is easier}} for <b>G-actin</b> to associate at the positive end of the filament, and harder at the negative end. However, it is possible to elongate the filament at either end. Association of <b>G-actin</b> into F-actin is regulated by the critical concentration outlined below. Actin polymerization can further be regulated by profilin and cofilin. Cofilin functions by binding to ADP-actin on the negative end of the filament, destabilizing it, and inducing depolymerization. Profilin induces ATP binding to <b>G-actin</b> {{so that it can be}} incorporated onto the positive end of the filament.|$|E
50|$|The {{growth of}} actin {{filaments}} can be regulated by thymosin and profilin. Thymosin binds to <b>G-actin</b> to buffer the polymerizing process, while profilin binds to <b>G-actin</b> to exchange ADP for ATP, promoting the monomeric {{addition to the}} barbed, plus end of F-actin filaments.|$|E
50|$|This figure {{demonstrates}} the morphological {{effects on the}} dendrites in LTP and LTD environments. In LTP {{we can see the}} larger spine volume as well as a greater ratio of F-actin to <b>G-actin.</b> This {{demonstrates the}} role of actin in LTP as well as the increased communication LTP creates. In the LTD environment, spine volume is decreased and there is a far greater ratio of <b>G-actin</b> to F-actin, demonstrating the importance of the F-actin to <b>G-actin</b> ratios in both LTP and LTD.|$|E
50|$|Actin {{remodeling}} {{consists of}} the dynamic changes in actin polymerization that underlie the morphological changes at the neural synapse. Actin is only able to cause all {{of the changes that}} promote long-term potentiation (LTP) through its formation from <b>G-actin</b> into F-actin. When F-actin is unable to form, long-term depression (LTD) is induced, which promotes opposite results. Stimulation of the neuron that promotes LTP causes larger spine volume, increased cell communication, and a greater ratio of F-actin to <b>G-actin.</b> In the LTD environment, spine volume is decreased, cell communication is decreased, and there is a far greater ratio of <b>G-actin</b> to F-actin.|$|E
50|$|ADP-ribosylation is {{a common}} enzymatic methods used by various {{bacterial}} toxins from various species. These toxins (including C. perfringens iota toxin and C. botulinum C2 toxin) attach a ribosyl-ADP moiety to surface arginine residue 177 of <b>G-actin.</b> This prevents <b>G-actin</b> assembling to form F-actin, and, thus, the cytoskeleton breaks down, resulting in cell death.|$|E

50|$|Actin binding {{proteins}} prove {{significant in}} actin remodeling, as the LIMK1/ADF/Cofilin Pathway facilitates {{the development of}} F-actin. Actin Depolymerizing Factor, or ADF, normally disassembles actin and {{does not allow for}} the induction of LTP. However, synaptic activity allows for the activation of LIMK1, a protein that phosphorylates the ADF/Cofilin complex at its phosphorylation site, Ser3, which inactivates the complex, allowing for the formation of F-actin. If this pathway is disrupted, then <b>G-actin</b> is unable to polymerize and LTP is inhibited. One particular actin binding protein that {{plays a major role in}} this pathway disruption is Gelsolin. This protein caps the barbed end of F-actin, thus blocking <b>G-actin</b> subunits to bind to the F-actin and allow for actin treadmilling. Activation of Gelsolin not only blocks LTP, but induces LTD. In LTD, the F to <b>G-actin</b> ratio is shifted towards <b>G-actin</b> and leads to a decrease in spine volume, as well as occasional disappearance of spines altogether.|$|E
5000|$|Within the cell, the {{concentrations}} of <b>G-actin</b> and F-actin continuously fluctuate. The assembly and disassembly of F-actin is regularly known as [...] "actin tread-milling". In this process, <b>G-actin</b> subunits primarily add to the [...] "barbed end" [...] of the filamentous polymer. This end proves to be both more thermodynamically favored for the addition of <b>G-actin</b> and kinetically dynamic as well. Simultaneously, older <b>G-actin</b> monomers [...] "fall off" [...] of the pointed end of the microfilament. At the [...] "pointed end" [...] of the F-actin polymer, actin monomers are bound to ADP, which dissociates more readily and rapidly than ATP-bound actin, which is found at the [...] "barbed end" [...] of the polymer. Thus, in environments with high concentrations of free actin subunits, filamentous growth at the [...] "barbed end" [...] remains {{greater than that of}} the [...] "pointed end". This [...] "tread-milling", essentially exists as a simplified explanation of the actin remodeling process.|$|E

5000|$|Thymosin β4 was {{initially}} {{perceived as a}} thymic hormone. However this changed when {{it was discovered that}} it forms a 1:1 complex with G (globular) actin, and is present at high concentration {{in a wide range of}} mammalian cell types. When appropriate, <b>G-actin</b> monomers polymerize to form F (filamentous) actin, which, together with other proteins that bind to actin, comprise cellular microfilaments. Formation by <b>G-actin</b> of the complex with β-thymosin (= [...] "sequestration") opposes this.|$|E
50|$|LTP {{inducing}} {{high frequency}} stimulation leads to NMDA receptor activation and calcium influx. Rho GTPases are then activated to polymerize <b>G-actin</b> to F-actin {{through the activity}} of actin binding proteins. An increase in the F-actin/G-actin ratio is observed 40 seconds after the LTP inducing stimulus. The increase in polymerized F-actin {{is due to the}} recruitment of <b>G-actin</b> monomers and the translation of actin mRNA in the dendrite. The stimulus induced change persists for approximately 5 weeks.|$|E
50|$|Actin {{exists in}} two {{states in the}} axonal and {{dendritic}} processes: globular or <b>G-actin</b> and filament/filamentous or F-actin. <b>G-actin</b> are the monomer building blocks that assemble via weak noncovalent interactions to form F-actin. F-actin is a two-stranded asymmetrical helical polymer. The asymmetrical quality of F-actin allows for different binding specificities at each end. One end shows an indentation and {{is referred to as}} the barbed end while the other resembles an arrow head and {{is referred to as the}} pointed end.|$|E
50|$|Actin {{polymerization}} and depolymerization {{is necessary}} in chemotaxis and cytokinesis. Nucleating factors are necessary to stimulate actin polymerization. One such nucleating factor is the Arp2/3 complex, which mimics a <b>G-actin</b> dimer in order to stimulate the nucleation (or formation of the first trimer) of monomeric <b>G-actin.</b> The Arp2/3 complex binds to actin filaments at 70 degrees to form new actin branches off existing actin filaments. Also, actin filaments themselves bind ATP, and hydrolysis of this ATP stimulates destabilization of the polymer.|$|E
50|$|Actin {{remains one}} of the most {{abundant}} proteins in all of Eukarya and is an enzyme (ATPase) that gradually hydrolyzes ATP. It exists in two forms within eukaryotic cells: globular or <b>G-actin</b> and filament/filamentous or F-actin. Globular actin is the monomeric form of the protein while the filamentous actin is a linear polymer of globular subunits. The assembly of filamentous actin arises as a result of weak, noncovalent interactions between <b>G-actin</b> and appears in the arrangement of a two-stranded asymmetrical helical polymer.|$|E
50|$|DBP {{has several}} functions. More precisely, domain III has the {{specific}} function {{of being an}} extracellular scavenger for <b>G-actin</b> released from necrotic cells at sites of tissue injury.|$|E

50|$|Due to its profusion in the cytosol and {{its ability}} to bind <b>G-actin</b> but not F-actin, {{thymosin}} β4 is regarded as the principal actin-sequestering protein in many cell types.|$|E
