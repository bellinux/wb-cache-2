5|$|For random {{walks in}} -dimensional integer lattices, George Pólya {{published}} in 1919 and 1921 work, {{where he studied}} {{the probability of a}} symmetric random walk returning to a previous position in the lattice. Pólya showed that a symmetric random walk, which has an equal probability to advance in any direction in the lattice, will return to a previous position in the lattice an infinite number of times with probability one in one and two dimensions, but with probability zero <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> higher dimensions.|$|E

5|$|Tessellations <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> more {{dimensions}} are called honeycombs. In three dimensions {{there is just}} one regular honeycomb, which has eight cubes at each polyhedron vertex. Similarly, in three dimensions there is just one quasiregular honeycomb, which has eight tetrahedra and six octahedra at each polyhedron vertex. However, there are many possible semiregular honeycombs in three dimensions. Uniform polyhedra can be constructed using the Wythoff construction.|$|E

50|$|Leaves: 'Virgin' (first-year) shoots {{are mostly}} pinnate with five {{leaflets}}, {{which range from}} 5-13 cm in length, while on fertile shoots leaflets are <b>in</b> <b>threes</b> <b>or</b> smaller.

25|$|Although many Gutenberg Bibles {{have been}} rebound over the years, nine copies retain fifteenth-century bindings. Most of these copies were bound in either Mainz or Erfurt.

25|$|The set of {{rotational}} symmetries of a polygon forms {{a finite}} cyclic group.

25|$|During the Baroque period, the {{transverse}} flute was redesigned. Now {{often called the}} traverso (from the Italian), it was made <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> four sections or joints with a conical bore from the head joint down. The conical bore design gave the flute a wider range and more penetrating sound without sacrificing the softer, expressive qualities. In addition to chamber music, the traverso began {{to be used in}} orchestral music.|$|E
25|$|While {{returning}} with the fleet to England after the campaign at Toulon, Shovell's flagship, the second-rate HMS Association, struck the rocks near the Isles of Scilly at 8pm on 22 October (2 November, by the modern calendar) 1707. HMS Association went down <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> four minutes, {{with none of}} the 800men that were on board saved, according to sailors watching on the first-rate HMS St George. Four large ships, HMS Association, the third-rate HMS Eagle, the fourth-rate HMS Romney and the fire ship HMS Firebrand all sank.|$|E
30|$|Furthermore, {{engaging}} <b>in</b> any <b>three</b> <b>or</b> {{two forms}} of innovation has mixed results. For example, the OLS results show that compared to non-innovating firms, engaging <b>in</b> either <b>three</b> <b>or</b> {{two forms of}} innovation is not associated with labour productivity. In essence, firms engaging <b>in</b> any <b>three</b> <b>or</b> two forms of innovation are {{not significantly different from}} non-innovating firms in terms of labour productivity. However, in comparison to non-innovating firms, engaging <b>in</b> any <b>three</b> forms of innovation is weakly associated with an increase in labour productivity among firms with low labour productivity while it is strongly associated with a reduction in labour productivity among firms with high labour productivity. The inverse relationship between labour productivity and innovation is further strengthened among firms with high labour productivity when a firm engages in any two kinds of innovation.|$|R

25|$|In the 19th and 20th centuries, some Conservative (as {{evidenced}} in the Etz Hayim chumash) and most Reform, Reconstructionist and Renewal congregations have {{switched to a}} triennial cycle, where the first third of each parashah is read one year, the second third {{the next year and}} the final third in a third year. This must be distinguished from the ancient practice, which was to read each seder in serial order regardless of the week of the year, completing the entire Torah <b>in</b> <b>three</b> (<b>or</b> three and a half) years in a linear fashion.|$|E
25|$|The carving is so {{deep that}} the forms are almost {{completely}} offset from the background resulting <b>in</b> <b>three,</b> <b>or</b> even four, layers of various figures and forms. What is more, overlapping figures fill the image space entirely, allowing no room to depict a background. Thus, the sense of space has been eliminated, giving rise to chaos {{and a sense of}} weary, open-ended victory. The effect of movement in the scene is evident and, unlike many battle sarcophagi which have more tranquil scenes on the side panels, the battle events continue {{all the way around the}} sarcophagus. The perspective constructed is also notable, although certainly not linear.|$|E
25|$|These 90mph trains were {{originally}} built as 3 car class 158s, but converted before entry into service. Twenty-two 3-car units were built for Network SouthEast's West of England and from London Waterloo to Salisbury, Yeovil and Exeter. They {{were used to}} replace Class 50 and Class 47 locomotive-hauled passenger trains. Units tend to operate in six or nine coach formations between Waterloo and Salisbury and <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> six coach formations between Salisbury and Exeter. South West Trains used to operate services from London Waterloo to Paignton, Plymouth and Penzance, but all services west of Exeter were withdrawn {{at the end of}} 2009.|$|E
