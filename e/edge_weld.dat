40|$|Because of {{the awkward}} and {{somewhat}} irregular {{shape of the}} weldment, conventional methods [1] could not be adapted to the nondestructive measurement of GTAW <b>edge</b> <b>weld</b> penetration on clamshell-style catalytic converters and a special inspection system based on the electric current deflection method was developed. DC or low-frequency AC electric resistance measurements, {{also known as the}} Potential Drop Method (PDM), are well-developed for plate thickness assessment and crack detection [2 – 6]. The operating principle of these methods is that, under certain arrangement of the electrodes, the defect or crack in a conducting specimen will cause a measurable increase in resistance between given points compared to the situation without the defect or crack. In recent years, this simple contact technique was largely obscured by more sophisticated noncontacting eddy-current techniques especially in industrial applications. In this article, we demonstrate the distinct advantages of the Potential Drop Method through the example of GTAW edge welds where the awkward shape of the specimens and the required large penetration depth render the eddy-current method less feasible...|$|E

Initially a study into a number of factors affecting the series expansion approach was conducted. Due to the over-determined nature of the series expansion approach appropriate selection of polynomial series order was necessary to develop the best prediction. The effect of elasto-plastic properties in experimental situations creates local slit tip yielding which could led to errors particularly at shallow depths and in near slit gauges. The specimens used for the plastic four-point bending were manufactured from ferritic steel with dimensions of width 10 mm, depth 25 mm and length 250 mm.

The sudden reaction force increase associated with the higher operating pressure (also known as the effective diameter shift problem) will usually destroy a balanced seal design. This study has developed an analytical procedure and demonstrated that the finite element method can be used to solve the mystery of effective diameter shift. ^ The second problem is that the fatigue life prediction of welded metal bellows is difficult caused by its built-in crack-like geometry which creates stress risers in the structures and singularities in the mathematical models. This study first developed a crack propagation model using the fracture mechanics approach to predict the fatigue life and demonstrated that the fatigue life of welded metal bellows associated with crack propagation is {{only a small portion of}} the total life. ^ The model was then modified to include the life associated with crack initiation by using the local stress-strain approach.

Mechanical and chemical cleaning of surfaces has been used previously to remove contaminants for weld joint preparations. However, these methods are slow, ineffective (e. g. due to hydrogen trapping) or lead to environmental hazards. This paper reports the effects of short pulsed laser surface cleaning on porosity formation and reduction in laser welding of AC- 170 PX (AA 6014) aluminium sheets (coated with Ti/Zr and lubricated using a dry lubricant AlO 70) with two types of joints: fillet edge and flange couch, using an AA 4043 filler wire for automotive component assembly. The effect of laser cleaning on porosity reduction during laser welding using a filler wire has not been reported before.

Heavy seam welded structures manufacturer has to present an optimized product to fulfill this requirement. In this purpose, the Modalohr system overcomes several challenges: transport 4 m height and 38 tons semi- trailer in UIC kinematic gauging with a low floor rail vehicle, use of conventional large wheel bogie with maximum axle load, 9 million kilometers running over 30 years service life. For cost effectiveness, the compact vehicle design uses welded assembly and avoids systematic full penetration welds which may require costly preparation machining.

40|$|Abstract. Zinc coated steels are {{nowadays}} {{used for}} different applications as for example for household appliances, automotive or offtakes. Due to the boiling temperature of zinc (907 °C), which {{is lower than}} the steel melting point, the welding of zinc coated steel sheets presents many difficulties. As a result of the violent evaporation of zinc, pores in the weld seam are present after solidification and the zinc coating near the weld is damaged. Brazing of zinc coated steels with CuSi-alloys offers some advantages, as the joining temperature is about 950 - 1000 °C. Nevertheless the high melting point of these filler materials requires very restricted process strategies and damaging of the zinc coating near the brazing seam can’t be avoided. Although laser-, plasma- and MIG-joining with CuSi and CuAl are performed nowadays. ZnAl-alloys are characterized through low melting temperature, which are comparable to the melting point of zinc, so that the damaging of the zinc coating can be reduced. In this paper investigations carried out with ZnAl-materials for joining zinc coated steel sheets as DC 04 ZE 75 / 75 and DX 56 Z (thickness 0, 9 mm) are reported. First investigations were performed by resistance spot soldering and show that using low temperature melting materials leads to a lower damaging of the zinc coating. Further the process reliability of laser soldering with ZnAl-alloys and a Nd:YAG as well as a diode laser is reported and confirms the suitability of these alloys for a damaging free joining zinc coated steels. The low surface tension leads to a wide bearing section, so that advantageous properties are expected.

Eighty two results are presented investigating {{the position of the}} applied load, the gusset plate height to length ratio, size, thickness, internal angle and the removal of the inside corner. The thickness of the loaded plate and its influence on the gusset plates failure is also investigated. Twenty two similar gusset plates were tested to investigate the welds connecting the gusset plate to the adjacent loaded and support edges. The experimental results are compared with existing methods, none of which cover all the variables tested. Some methods do not consider buckling and most of those that do are inadequate. Most of the methods do not accurately take account of the load position. An alternative method based on experimental observations is presented for design purposes. The method covers any combination of the variables tested. To test assumptions made in the theoretical work forty seven strut tests took place to investigate buckling characteristics and fifteen special gusset plates were also tested. The gusset plates were found to fail in an elastic-plastic buckling manner. A gusset plate has a specific moment of resistance capacity about it’s inside corner and the ultimate load that can be applied is dependent upon the position of the load relative to the supported edge. There is an optimum height to length ratio for strength and any increase in the internal angle from 90 degrees produces little change in moment capacity. The removal of small portions of the inside corner of a gusset plate has little effect upon its moment capacity. The loaded plate does not provide any significant moment of resistance to the applied load at failure. The main functions of the loaded and supported <b>edge</b> <b>welds</b> is to prevent the gusset plate from slipping from between the plates...|$|R
