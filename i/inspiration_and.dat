5|$|Ant {{societies}} have division of labour, communication between individuals, {{and an ability}} to solve complex problems. These parallels with human {{societies have}} long been an <b>inspiration</b> <b>and</b> subject of study. Many human cultures make use of ants in cuisine, medication, and rituals. Some species are valued in their role as biological pest control agents. Their ability to exploit resources may bring ants into conflict with humans, however, as they can damage crops and invade buildings. Some species, such as the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta), are regarded as invasive species, establishing themselves in areas where they have been introduced accidentally.|$|E
5|$|By 1827, {{the family}} had {{returned}} to Leipzig. Wagner's first lessons in harmony were taken during 1828–31 with Christian Gottlieb Müller. In January 1828 he first heard Beethoven's 7th Symphony and then, in March, the same composer's 9th Symphony (both at the Gewandhaus). Beethoven became a major <b>inspiration,</b> <b>and</b> Wagner wrote a piano transcription of the 9th Symphony. He was also greatly impressed by a performance of Mozart's Requiem. Wagner's early piano sonatas and his first attempts at orchestral overtures date from this period.|$|E
5|$|Cigars of the Pharaoh {{was adapted}} into a 1991 episode of The Adventures of Tintin {{television}} series by French studio Ellipse and Canadian animation company Nelvana.

(Years later, in 1923, Sir Roderick Jones, head of Reuters, and his wife, playwright and novelist Enid Bagnold, were to add the adjacent Gothic House to the property, which became the <b>inspiration</b> <b>and</b> setting for her play The Chalk Garden).|$|E
5|$|Lung {{function}} {{testing is}} carried out by evaluating a person's capacity to inhale and exhale in different circumstances. The volume of air inhaled and exhaled by a person at rest is the tidal volume (normally 500-750mL); the inspiratory reserve volume and expiratory reserve volume are the additional amounts a person is able to forcibly inhale and exhale respectively. The summed total of forced <b>inspiration</b> <b>and</b> expiration is a person's vital capacity. Not all air is expelled from the lungs even after a forced breath out; {{the remainder of the}} air is called the residual volume. Together these terms are referred to as lung volumes.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{imagined}} as a three-season television show, Cartoon Network {{asked for}} it to be a feature film. During production, the miniseries format that eventually became that for Over the Garden Wall was decided on. The film serves as the <b>inspiration</b> <b>and</b> pilot for the aforementioned miniseries, which premiered in 2014. The network, whose animation studio produced the film, also served as distributor. Released in 2013 to multiple film festivals, Tome of the Unknown has received several accolades.|$|E

Guest star James Marsters was cast immediately after his audition {{for the role of}} Eric Swan, and although several of Millennium crew were fans of the series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, in which Marsters had a recurring role, Perry recalled none of them recognizing the actor during his audition due to the strength of his performance.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is played}} from a third-person perspective, and its world is navigated on foot or by vehicle. The open world design lets the player freely roam Vice City, {{consisting}} of two main islands. The game's plot is based on multiple real-world people and events in Miami such as Cuban, Haitian, and Biker gangs, the 1980s crack epidemic, the Mafioso drug lords of Miami, and the dominance of glam metal. The game was also influenced by the film and television of the era, including Scarface and Miami Vice. Much of the development work constituted creating the game world to fit the <b>inspiration</b> <b>and</b> time period; the development team conducted extensive field research in Miami while creating the world.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposed}} site in Hong Kong's Central District {{was less}} than ideal; a tangle of highways lined it on three sides. The area had also been home to a headquarters for Japanese military police during World WarII, and was notorious for prisoner torture. The small parcel of land made a tall tower necessary, and Pei had usually shied away from such projects; in Hong Kong especially, the skyscrapers lacked any real architectural character. Lacking <b>inspiration</b> <b>and</b> unsure of how to approach the building, Pei took a weekend vacation to the family home in Katonah, New York. There he found himself experimenting with a bundle of sticks until he happened upon a cascading sequence.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the Brezhnev {{years and}} the lengthy interregnum that followed, the {{generation}} which had come of age during the 'first Russian spring' of the 1950s awaited its turn in power. As Brezhnev and his colleagues died or were pensioned off, they were replaced {{by men and women}} for whom the Secret Speech and the first wave of de-Stalinization had been a formative experience, and these 'Children of Twentieth Congress' took up the reins of power under the leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev and his colleagues. The Khrushchev era provided this second generation of reformers with both an <b>inspiration</b> <b>and</b> a cautionary tale.|$|E
5|$|While Briggs held to {{traditional}} Christian teaching in many areas, {{such as his}} belief in the virgin birth of Jesus, conservatives were alarmed by his assertion that doctrines were historical constructs that had to change over time. He did not believe that the Pentateuch was authored by Moses or that the book of Isaiah had a single author. In addition, he also denied that biblical prophecy was a precise prediction of the future. In 1891, Briggs preached a sermon in which he claimed the Bible contained errors, a position many in the church considered contrary to the Westminster Confession's doctrines of verbal <b>inspiration</b> <b>and</b> biblical inerrancy.|$|E

5|$|At this point, Grant began {{describing}} {{himself as}} the O.H.O. (Outer Head of the Order) of the O.T.O., claiming that he deserved this title not by direct succession from Crowley but because he displayed the <b>inspiration</b> <b>and</b> innovation that Germer lacked. A document purportedly by Crowley naming Grant as his successor was subsequently exposed as a hoax created by Robert Taylor, a Typhonian O.T.O. member. In the early 1970s he established his own Thelemic organisation, the Typhonian O.T.O., which produced its first official announcement in 1973. Although adopting the O.T.O. degree system used by Crowley, Grant removed the rituals of initiation designed to allow a member to enter a higher degree; instead he personally promoted them through the degrees according to what he believed were their own personal spiritual development.|$|E
5|$|In 2010 Natalia Lafourcade joined Mexican {{orchestra}} conductor Alondra de la Parra on {{the musical}} project Travieso Carmesí, an album created {{as part of}} the Bicentennial of Mexico celebration. While conducting research to find songs for that album, Lafourcade studied Mexican singer-songwriter Agustín Lara catalog and decided to record a tribute album with his songs. Released in 2012, Mujer Divina earned her accolades for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Long Form Music Video at the 14th Latin Grammy Awards. Two years later, Lafourcade traveled to Veracruz (Mexico), Colombia, and Cuba in a search for musical <b>inspiration</b> <b>and</b> a balance between heart, mind and body. She has said that composition of her new music for Hasta la Raíz was closely woven with the experience of singing Lara's music.|$|E
5|$|K. V. Vijayendra Prasad was {{watching}} a Marathi film where two warriors Sivaji and Tanaji are attacked by Mughal Army. Once the duo can reach Sinhagad fort, they can kill the army together effectively. While Sivaji escapes to the fort for support, Tanaji fights with the army and dies in the process leaving Sivaji in grief. Prasad took this as an <b>inspiration</b> <b>and</b> wrote {{a story on the}} theme of reincarnation of a bodyguard who serves a queen. He fights 100 warriors and dies in his attempt to re-enthrone his queen after she is overthrown by her conspirators. He is reborn after 400 years and fulfils his ambition of placing her on the throne by making her a Chief Minister or a popular social worker like Medha Patkar. It was subsequently rejected and after fifteen years, his son director S. S. Rajamouli selected this script, but made several changes to it. Rajamouli re-characterised the queen as a princess to create a vital love story for the film, as he felt that the relationship between a queen and a bodyguard would be only about loyalty and honesty.|$|E
