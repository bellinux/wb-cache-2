25|$|Moto Guzzis {{have used}} an {{hydraulic}} integrated brake system, where the right front disc works off the handlebar lever, while the left {{front and the}} rear disc work off the <b>foot</b> <b>brake.</b>|$|E
25|$|The KR175 {{used the}} {{standard}} Kabinenroller steering system, with a steering bar connected {{directly to the}} track rods of the front wheels, providing an extremely direct response best suited to small, measured inputs. The KR175's steering bar was made from tubular steel. The gearshift lever, {{on the right side}} of the cockpit, had a secondary lever on it which operated the clutch. The throttle was operated by a twist-grip on the left handlebar. The <b>foot</b> <b>brake</b> pedal, which was the only pedal in the car, operated brakes on all three wheels mechanically, using cables. The handbrake lever operated similarly.|$|E
25|$|Power {{operated}} parking brakes are {{fitted to}} heavy commercial vehicles with air brakes, such as trucks and buses. These are usually spring applied, with air pressure {{being used to}} hold the brake off and powerful springs holding the brakes on. In most cases, a small lever in the cab is connected to a valve which can admit air to the parking brake cylinders to release the parking brake, or release the air to apply the brake. On some modern vehicles the valve is operated electrically from a lever or button in the cab. The system is relatively safe since if air pressure is lost the springs will apply the brakes. Also, the system prevents the parking brake being released if there is insufficient air pressure to apply the <b>foot</b> <b>brake.</b> A disadvantage to this system {{is that if a}} vehicle requires towing and cannot provide its own air supply, an external supply must be provided to allow the parking brake to be released, or the brake shoes must be manually wound off against the springs.|$|E
5000|$|... brakes: both {{hand and}} <b>foot</b> <b>brakes</b> applied {{directly}} to the rear wheels. The car pulled up swiftly, completely free of harshness ...|$|R
50|$|When left <b>foot</b> <b>braking</b> is used {{to apply}} the brake and the {{throttle}} {{at the same time it}} is very hard on the car, causing extra wear on the transmission and brakes in particular.|$|R
50|$|Also {{notice that}} the more widely adopted left <b>foot</b> <b>braking</b> {{technique}} in modern race cars requires a sensitive left foot to operate and a left-hand-driver with a more dominated left <b>foot</b> may <b>brake</b> better than those who <b>brakes</b> with right <b>foot</b> or whose left foot isn't dominated, this drastically shorten the time from maximum acceleration to maximum deceleration and left footer possesses a much greater advantages in racing.|$|R
500|$|As well as [...] "park" [...] "neutral" [...] and [...] "reverse" [...] {{there are}} three {{regeneration}} positions, intended for city driving, hilly terrain, and flat terrain respectively. Used correctly, on most journeys, {{a large percentage of}} kinetic energy and potential energy can be returned to the battery. Lifting off the accelerator/”gas” pedal also induces regeneration as does light pressure on the <b>foot</b> <b>brake.</b> [...] The only other mechanical losses are frictional. The main loss is aerodynamic drag which is proportional to the square of speed, hence high speeds are inefficient and reduce range.|$|E
2500|$|The car {{was fitted}} with a purpose built 18.3-litre V12 engine based on a hybrid of the Sunbeam Manitou and Sunbeam Arab aero engines. [...] This engine had four blocks of three {{cylinders}} arranged in two banks set at 60 degrees (unlike the Arab which were set at 90 degrees). Each cylinder had one inlet and two exhaust valves actuated by a single overhead camshaft. The two camshafts were driven by {{a complex set of}} 16 gears {{from the front of the}} crankshaft - a very similar arrangement to that used on the Maori engine which had two OHC per bank of cylinders. A 4-speed transmission initially drove a back axle with differential with a shaft drive rather than the hazardous chains of other cars. Harry Hawker drove the car in 1920 at Brooklands but suffered a burst tyre, spinning off the circuit. The differential was replaced with a simple crown wheel and pinion so that the rear wheels were locked together and it was more successful in the hands of Kenelm Lee Guinness. Brakes were crude, as was usual in the period, with a <b>foot</b> <b>brake</b> acting on the transmission and a hand brake on the rear drums. Suspension was also typical, with half-elliptic springs all round damped by Andre Hartford friction shock absorbers.|$|E
2500|$|Whilst {{the motor}} vehicle is {{stationary}} and in neutral (N), the driver can select D for drive (after first pressing the <b>foot</b> <b>brake</b> pedal). The transmission's reverse gear is selected {{on the first}} shaft K1, and the outer clutch K2 engages {{at the start of}} the bite point. At the same time, on the alternate gear shaft, the reverse gear clutch K1 is also selected (pre-selected), as the gearbox doesn't know whether the driver wants to go forward or reverse. The clutch pack for second gear (K2) gets ready to engage. When the driver releases the brake pedal, the K2 clutch pack increases the clamping force, allowing the second gear to take up the drive through an increase of the bite point, and thereby transferring the torque from the engine through the transmission to the drive shafts and road wheels, causing the vehicle to move forward. Depressing the accelerator pedal engages the clutch and causes an increase of forward vehicle speed. Pressing the throttle pedal to the floor (hard acceleration) will cause the gearbox to [...] "kick down" [...] to first gear to provide the acceleration associated with first, although there will be a slight hesitation while the gearbox deselects second gear and selects first gear. As the vehicle accelerates, the transmission's computer determines when the second gear (which is connected to the second clutch) should be fully used. Depending on the vehicle speed and amount of engine power being requested by the driver (determined by the position of the throttle pedal), the DSG then up-shifts. During this sequence, the DSG disengages the first outer clutch whilst simultaneously engaging the second inner clutch (all power from the engine is now going through the second shaft), thus completing the shift sequence. This sequence happens in 8milliseconds (aided by pre-selection), and can happen even with full throttle opening, and as a result, there is virtually no power loss.|$|E
50|$|Another {{variation}} of <b>foot</b> <b>braking</b> is a sit brake. This involves the rider going from {{a standing position}} to sitting {{on the board and}} putting both feet down. This method can be useful in a tight situation where the rider must stop very quickly but does not have enough room to slide.|$|R
5000|$|Driveline shunt {{should not}} be {{confused}} with engine surge in automatic vehicle transmissions where an engine [...] "searches" [...] for its idle speed whilst at very low road speeds, and causes unexpected surges in acceleration. This is a different phenomenon which can be mitigated by an experienced driver using left <b>foot</b> <b>braking</b> for such very low speed maneuvering.|$|R
50|$|The 3/15 DA-2 {{replaced}} the DA-1 in April 1929. The main {{change from the}} DA-1 was {{the operation of the}} <b>foot</b> <b>brakes,</b> controlled via cable linkage, now acting on all four wheels: brakes on the DA-1 had operated only the rear wheels. Other changes included larger tyres and a lower final drive ratio. There was no change in either the size or the claimed output and performance from the car's four cylinder four-stroke side-valve engine.|$|R
60|$|The girl fell {{backward}} {{from her}} mount, turning to grasp Custer's arm as it closed about her. At {{the same instant}} Barney closed the throttle, and threw all {{the weight of his}} body upon the <b>foot</b> <b>brake.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was in a}} {{car with}} a man once. I said to him: 'What would happen if you trod on that pedal thing instead of that other pedal thing?' He said, 'I couldn't. One's the <b>foot</b> <b>brake,</b> and the other's the accelerator.' 'But suppose you did?' I said. 'I wouldn't,' he said. 'Now we'll let her rip.' So he stamped on the accelerator. Only {{it turned out to be}} the <b>foot</b> <b>brake</b> after all, and we stopped dead, and skidded into a ditch. The advice I give to every young man {{starting}} life is: 'Never confuse the unusual and the impossible.' Take the present case. If you had only realized the possibility of somebody someday collaring your study, you might have thought out dozens of sound schemes for dealing with the matter. As it is, you are unprepared. The thing comes on you as a surprise. The cry goes round: 'Spiller has been taken unawares. He cannot cope with the situation.'" ...|$|E
60|$|It was the <b>foot</b> <b>brake</b> {{that had}} given away. The hand brake was still fit for use, but each of the Rover boys remembered with dismay that this brake had been loose for some time. They had thought to tighten it up, but other matters had claimed their attention, and they had not deemed it {{absolutely}} necessary before taking the short trip to Rayville, since on starting the other brake had {{seemed to be in}} good order.|$|E
5000|$|The ER5 uses {{standard}} motorcycle controls; {{left hand}} clutch, right hand front brake and throttle, left foot gear stick, right <b>foot</b> rear <b>brake.</b>|$|R
50|$|On the road, the tester advised, the new Morris Minor S.V. {{exceeded}} 50 mph. A {{certain amount}} of wheel-bounce consumed {{a lot of power}} when testing standing-start times. The tappets could have been adjusted more finely, the accelerator needs a steadier spring and there should be a rest pedal beside it. Speed and brake levers were rather distant, top speed was apt to jump out when the load came off, some wheel bounce and movement with such a short wheelbase is acceptable, the <b>foot</b> <b>brakes</b> pulled to the near-side.|$|R
50|$|Dead pedals {{have never}} been a {{required}} addition to standard automobile pedal sets. This is because the advantages of having a dead pedal are most commonly associated with manual transmission cars. Furthermore, cars with left side drive often have a natural footrest because of the wheel well so it is more common to find right side drive cars with dead pedals. However, the dead pedal promotes safe driving habits by serving as a place for drivers to place their foot and prevent accidental left <b>foot</b> <b>braking.</b> It is not recommended to brake with the left foot because it is less confusing when switching between automatic and manual transmission cars. Resting one's <b>foot</b> on the <b>brake</b> pedal may also accidentally light up the brake lights when the vehicle is not decelerating.|$|R

50|$|Longboards can be {{used for}} {{traveling}} long distances. Long distance skating with charitable fundraising has even emerged (see Charitable distance skating). Any skateboard {{can be used}} for long distance journeys, however, decks designed specifically for long distance trips are typically lower to the ground than regular top mounted longboards. Common ways to lower the decks are {{in the construction of the}} boards; drop-through mounting allows for the whole board to be mounted lower on the trucks and can be combined with a drop-down deck. Drop-down decks are shaped to allow your feet to ride lower than where the trucks are mounted. A lower deck increases stability and makes for easy pushing and <b>foot</b> <b>braking.</b>|$|R
50|$|On the VTX1800, Honda updated its linked braking feature, {{instead of}} having the usual {{separate}} hand and <b>foot</b> <b>brakes,</b> the hand brake operated two-thirds of the front pistons while the foot operated the other third in front and all the rear via a proportioning valve. The induction system was Honda's programmed Fuel Injection (PGM-FI) system using a Manifold Air Pressure (MAP) sensor in the small throttle areas until the standard throttle position sensor (Alpha N) took over at greater throttle opening values. The VTX1800 also had an emission control system that utilized air injection and catalytic converter controlled by the ECU to reduce hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen to levels surpassing emissions standards.|$|R
5000|$|On car #2842 (December 1975), a {{micro switch}} {{was added to}} the <b>foot</b> <b>brake</b> to prevent the {{accelerator}} from functioning when the brake was pressed.|$|E
50|$|Moto Guzzis {{have used}} an {{hydraulic}} integrated brake system, where the right front disc works off the handlebar lever, while the left {{front and the}} rear disc work off the <b>foot</b> <b>brake.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>foot</b> <b>brake</b> {{operates}} on the transmission and the lever brakes {{on the rear}} wheels. Both sets are of the internal expanding type. The adjustment for wear of the <b>foot</b> <b>brake</b> may be made by hand but adjustment of the rear brakes requires a spanner. Twelve months later front brakes were made available on new cars for a further £55. A year later again they were standardised on the 23-60 in July 1924 along with a redesigned front axle, springs and saddle-plate. Operated by the foot pedal the front brakes and the transmission brake were linked, the latter being given a slight lead. The brakes on the rear wheels were independently controlled by the handbrake lever.|$|E
50|$|Karts, many open wheelers, {{and some}} modern road cars (cars that are mounted with {{automatic}} transmission or semi-automatic transmission {{as used in}} motorsports such as Formula One), have no foot-operated clutch, and so allow the driver to use their left <b>foot</b> to <b>brake.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Foot</b> <b>braking</b> {{involves}} {{putting one}} foot on the road while balancing on the board with the other foot and needs to provide all load of your body to the front foot. This technique can be used to reduce speed or come to a full stop and it is a very helpful technique for an emergency case. This is helpful in racing or in tight situations where the rider does not feel comfortable sliding, or when a rider only needs to lose a small amount of speed prior to entering a turn. However this method can be wasteful and tends to destroy shoes as the sole of the shoe is worn away and doesn't shed speed nearly as fast as sliding.|$|R
5000|$|Proper heel-and-toe {{technique}} aids both {{slowing the}} vehicle {{while at the}} same time accelerating the engine for a matched downshift. Note that neglecting to rev-match in any downshifting scenario can be extremely dangerous, especially in low-traction conditions. Heel-and-toe may be used with any type of gearbox when simultaneous braking and downshifting is necessary. Though difficult, mastering the heel-and-toe technique in conjunction with necessary clutching is essential for high performance driving (e.g., rally racing) to stay in the optimal gear regardless of the simultaneous braking, accelerating, and clutching required for shifts. This allows the engine to stay in its [...] "power band" [...] and allows one to drive as fast as possible. Left <b>foot</b> <b>braking</b> while accelerating the engine with the right foot to accommodate downshifting in a clutchless situation accomplishes the same feat.|$|R
