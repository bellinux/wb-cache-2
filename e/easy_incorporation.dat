5000|$|However, {{in a power}} chord, {{the ratio}} between the {{frequencies}} of the root and fifth {{are very close to}} the just interval 3:2. When played through distortion, the intermodulation leads to the production of partials closely related in frequency to the harmonics of the original two notes, producing a more coherent sound. The intermodulation makes the spectrum of the sound expand in both directions, and with enough distortion, a new fundamental frequency component appears an octave lower than the root note of the chord played without distortion, giving a richer, more bassy and more subjectively 'powerful' sound than the undistorted signal. Even when played without distortion, the simple ratios between the harmonics in the notes of a power chord can give a stark and powerful sound, owing to the resultant tone effect. Power chords also have the advantage of being relatively easy to play (see [...] "Fingering" [...] below), allowing fast chord changes and <b>easy</b> <b>incorporation</b> into melodies and riffs.|$|E

40|$|Copyright © 2003 IEEEThis paper {{addresses}} {{the design and}} performance of time-recursive receivers for diversity based communication systems with flat Rayleigh or Ricean fading. The paper introduces a general state-space model for such systems, where there is temporal correlation in the channel gain. Such an approach encompasses {{a wide range of}} diversity systems such as spatial diversity, frequency diversity, and code diversity systems which are used in practice. The paper describes a number of noncoherent receiver structures derived from both sequence and a posteriori probability-based cost functions and compares their performance using an orthogonal frequency-division multiplex example. In this example, the paper shows how a standard physical delay-Doppler scattering channel model can be approximated by the proposed state-space model. The simulations show that significant performance gains can be made by exploiting temporal, as well as diversity channel correlations. The paper argues that such time-recursive receivers offer some advantages over block processing schemes such as computational and memory requirement reductions and the <b>easier</b> <b>incorporation</b> of adaptivity in the receiver structures.

The data show that films with optical gaps ranging from about 1. 9 to 3. 6 eV could be produced.

The microstuctural and photoelectronic properties of the silicon carbide films were characterized by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS), elastic recoil detection analysis (ERDA), and FT-IR spectrometry. The results show that a higher hydrogen dilution ratio enhances the incorporation of silicon atoms in the amorphous carbon matrix for carbon-rich a-Si 1 -xCx:H films. One pin structure was prepared by using the a-Si 1 -xCx:H film as the intrinsic layer.

40|$|The Langmuir {{monolayer}} {{technique is}} one of the methods used to build models of cellular membranes and enables to investigate the interactions of membrane components with other biomolecules. This method has been applied to study the effect of edelfosine - a synthetic alkyl-lysophospholipid analog - on model lipid membranes in order to get insight into its mode of action and selectivity. Edelfosine is mainly known for its anticancer properties, although it is also applied in the treatment of other diseases, like autoimmune, anti-HIV and antiparasitic. In this review we focus on its antitumor activity (although some other aspects of its therapeutic effects are also indicated) and summarize the results obtained so far with use of the monolayer technique. The application of this method evidenced for a key role of cholesterol and membrane rafts in the mechanism of anticancer activity of edelfosine. As regards the selectivity of this drug, the obtained results proved that the difference in fluidity of tumor versus normal cell membrane is important but probably not the only factor determining an <b>easier</b> <b>incorporation</b> of edelfosine into cancer cells.

40|$|In situ atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM) {{experiments have}} provided information {{about the effect of}} Ba 21 on crystal growth of calcite { 101 ¯ 4 } surfaces. The microtopographic features observed have been interpreted by considering both the structural control that the calcite surfaces exert on the incorporation of divalent cations and the supersaturation state of the solution used. Pinning of the calcite growth steps occurs at low Ba concentrations, suggesting specific sites for Ba incorporation. When the Ba content of the solution is increased the advancement of monomolecular steps is observed. Although [4 ¯ 41] 1 and [481 ¯] 1 steps advance showing characteristic jagged edges, the parallel steps (i. e., [4 ¯ 41] 2 and [481 ¯] 2) remain practically immobile. This fact can be explained by considering the nonsymmetrically related distribution of large and small sites along the calcite steps and the <b>easier</b> <b>incorporation</b> of barium on the former. The measured increase in the height of the newly grown steps is also consistent with such preferential incorporation of Ba in certain positions. A further increase in the Ba concentration of the solutions leads to the formation of bidimensional nuclei on the calcite { 101 ¯ 4 } surfaces. The nature of these nuclei is discussed taking into account the supersaturation of the solution with respect to two possible structures that can accommodate Ba: the calcite-type structure and the aragonite-type structure...|$|R

It is accepted procedure in litigation about earnings, such as cases involving the value of lost earnings due to injury, death, or discrimination. It is also often used to make educational policy decisions based on estimates of the rate of return from schooling. The HCEF relates the natural logarithm of earnings to investments in human capital measured in time, such as years of schooling and years of post-school work experience.

40|$|Compound {{semiconductor}} (III-V) {{devices are}} crucially {{important in a}} range of RF/microwave applications. High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs), as the best low noise high frequency compound semiconductor devices, have been utilised in various applications at microwave and mm-wave frequencies such as communications, imaging, sensing and power. However, silicon based manufacturing will always be the heart of the semiconductor industry. III-V devices are conventionally fabricated using gold-based metallisation and lift off processes, which are incompatible with silicon manufacturing processes based on blanket metal or dielectric deposition and subtractive patterning by dry etching techniques. Therefore, the challenge is to develop silicon compatible processes for the realisation of compound semiconductor devices, whilst not compromising the device performance. In this work, silicon compatible processes for HEMT realisation have been developed, including the demonstration of a copper-based T-gate with the normalised DC resistance of 42 Ω/mm, and the presentation of a gate-first process flow which can incorporate the copper-based T-gate. The copper electroplating process for fabricating T-gate head with the maximum width of 2. 5 µm, low damage inductively coupled plasma molybdenum etching process for realising T-gate foot with the minimum footprint of 30 nm, and the full gate-first process flow with non-annealed ohmic contact are described in detail. In addition, this thesis also describes the fabrication and characterisation of a 60 nm footprint gold-based T-gate HEMT realised by conventional III-V processes, yielding a cutoff frequency fT of 183 GHz and maximum oscillation frequency fmax of 156 GHz. In the comparison between these two types of HEMT, it is anticipated that a HEMT with the copper-based T-gate would not only have a larger maximum frequency of oscillation fmax, but also an <b>easier</b> <b>incorporation</b> into a silicon based manufacturing fab in terms of process technologies, than a HEMT with the gold-based T-gate...|$|R

Special and rehabilitation teachers, as the experts for working with children with special needs, can offer various forms of help and support, by means of which they would acquire some new knowledge, upgrade them and develop their competencies, necessary for the work with the children with special needs. The professional team of a kindergarten, guided by a special and rehabilitation teacher, is one of the effective forms of help and support to the professional workers. Through such team, the professional workers gain high levels of expertise from the field of working with children with special needs, which derive from special skills of the special and rehabilitation teacher, experiences of the professional workers, and various professional literature. The competencies are upgraded in such a way. Consequently, the professional workers cope with situations, which they encounter more easily while working with the children with special needs. In the research part, we formed and used a survey questionnaire, which was appropriately filled in by 110 professional workers – teachers of the preschool children and assistant teachers from kindergartens from all over Slovenia. The purpose of the research was to ascertain how professional workers percept their competencies and educational needs in the field of working with children with special needs, and which forms of help and support they need by special and rehabilitation teachers. By means of a questionnaire, we were also discovering, whether the professional workers in the kindergarten express a need for forming a professional team, led by the special and rehabilitation teacher, with the purpose of offering some help, support and additional professional knowledge and competencies for working with children with special needs.
