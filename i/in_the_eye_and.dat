5|$|With {{continued}} favorable conditions, Carlotta quickly {{developed a}} ragged central dense overcast, or centralized area of convection. An eye feature began developing on June15, and {{later that day}} Carlotta intensified into a hurricane while approaching southwestern Mexico. A Hurricane Hunters flight late on June15 indicated Carlotta was rapidly intensifying, observing winds of 110mph (175km/h) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> well-established outflow; the crew also observed flight-level winds of 114mph (183km/h). The NHC initially predicted the hurricane would move along the Mexican coast just offshore, which would have allowed Carlotta to maintain much of its intensity. Shortly after its peak, Hurricane Carlotta weakened slightly as to the eye's began to interact with land. The hurricane made landfall near Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca, with winds estimated at 105mph (165km/h) and a minimum pressure of , shortly after 0100UTC on June16, becoming the easternmost tropical cyclone in the Eastern Pacific to make landfall at hurricane intensity on record until surpassed by Hurricane Barbara a year later. Carlotta rapidly weakened while moving inland, and it had deteriorated to tropical depression status by 12hours after landfall. Although the cloud pattern became disrupted, the storm maintained a large area of thunderstorms. Very early on June17, the NHC reported that Carlotta had weakened into a post-tropical remnant low; the system still had a broad circulation over southwestern Mexico at the time. Later that day, the low degenerated into a trough along {{the west coast of}} Mexico.|$|E

25|$|The eye logo {{for this}} series {{was the same}} yellow and black {{spiraled}} eye used for Big Brother 7.

25|$|There {{are some}} {{exceptions}} from the types mentioned above. Some insects have a so-called single lens compound eye, a transitional type {{which is something}} between a superposition type of the multi-lens compound eye and the single lens eye found in animals with simple eyes. Then there is the mysid shrimp Dioptromysis paucispinosa. The shrimp has an eye of the refracting superposition type, in the rear behind this in each eye {{there is a single}} large facet that is three times in diameter the others <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> behind this is an enlarged crystalline cone. This projects an upright image on a specialised retina. The resulting eye is a mixture of a simple eye within a compound eye.|$|E

He became {{commander}} of the 1st Rifle Platoon of the 1st Separate Rifle Battalion in the 43rd Separate Rifle Brigade with the rank of Junior lieutenant. In November 1942, {{in the area of}} the village of Ishcherskaya, Suleymanov led his platoon in a counterattack and repulsed the German troops. Despite being wounded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> leg, he reportedly did not leave the battlefield. On 13 December 1942 he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union and the Order of Lenin. In 1943, Suleymanov joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|When {{melatonin}} receptor agonists activate their receptors {{it causes}} numerous physiological processes. MT1 and MT2 receptors {{may be a}} target {{for the treatment of}} circadian and non circadian sleep disorders because of their differences in pharmacology and function within the SCN. The SCN is responsible for maintaining the 24 hour cycle which regulates many different body functions ranging from sleep to immune functions. Melatonin receptors have been identified in the cardiovascular system. Evidence from animal studies points to a dual role of melatonin in the vasculature. Activation of MT1 receptors mediates vasoconstriction and the activation of MT2 receptors mediates vasodilation. Melatonin is involved in regulating immune responses in both human and animals through activation of both MT1 and MT2 receptors. MT1 and MT2 receptors are widespread <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> are involved in regulating aqueous humor secretion, which is important for glaucoma, and in phototransduction. This is not a complete list since many of the possible processes need further confirmation.|$|E
25|$|The suspects' {{mobile phones}} and {{personal}} computers contained multiple video {{recordings of the}} murders. A video was leaked to the Internet, showing the murder of 48‑year-old Sergei Yatzenko. He is seen {{lying on his back}} in a wooded area, and is struck repeatedly in the face with a hammer held inside a plastic bag. One attacker stabs Yatzenko <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> abdomen with a screwdriver. Yatzenko is then struck with the hammer to ensure he is dead. The attack lasts over four minutes, during which the victim lapses in and out of consciousness. One murderer is seen smiling towards the camera during the video. The murderers walk back to their car, showing that the crime took place close to the side of a road, next to their parked car. They discuss the murder calmly, expressing mild surprise that the victim was still breathing after a screwdriver was plunged into his exposed brain. The suspects then wash their hands and the hammer with a water bottle, and begin to laugh. Only two suspects appear to be present in the video, with one always behind the camera.|$|E

25|$|Thomas bowled over 63,000 balls for Northamptonshire, and {{opposing}} batsmen scored {{off of the}} Welsh medium-pacer at {{an average}} of just under two runs an over. It was his control that was a significant feature of the clubs bowling attack following the First World War. Furthermore, his approach to life mirrored his approach to cricket; sound, level-headed and a calming influence on some of his more temperamental colleagues. Billeted in Northampton during the war years, Thomas had attracted the attention of groundsman Alf Stockwin when he came to bowl in the nets at Wantage Road. His debut, against the Australian Imperial Forces side in 1919, was not a great success, but Northampton Grammar School took him on as groundsman and coach, giving Northamptonshire the opportunity to keep tabs on him. They decided to take another look and he justified their interest with 9-30 against Yorkshire at Bradford in 1920 with the last seven wickets only costing him six runs, and one lifting ball hit wicketkeeper Walter Buswell <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> put him out of the match. Only 'Bumper' Wells' dismissal of Roy Kilner prevented the county's first 'all-ten'.|$|E
25|$|Real Madrid {{opened their}} {{competitive}} {{season with a}} 2–2 draw {{at home in the}} first leg of the 2011 Supercopa de España against Barcelona on August 14. Özil scored after 13 minutes following an assist from Benzema, but goals from David Villa and Lionel Messi against the run of play gave Barcelona the lead at halftime. Xabi Alonso shot through traffic during a corner sequence for the equalizer nine minutes into the second half. Three days later in the return leg at Camp Nou, Barcelona defeated Real Madrid 3–2 to win 5–4 on aggregate. Andrés Iniesta beat the offside trap and scored first for Barcelona, but Ronaldo redirected a cross to equalize five minutes later. Messi scored just before halftime following a failed clearance of a corner kick by Real Madrid and a subsequent backheel assist from Gerard Piqué to give Barcelona a 2–1 lead at halftime. Benzema leveled the score late in the second half following a scramble from a corner kick, but an Adriano cross allowed Messi to score the winning goal in the 88th minute. Marcelo received a straight red card in stoppage time for a tackle on Cesc Fàbregas, creating an ensuing scuffle between the two sides that led to Mourinho confronting Barcelona assistant coach Tito Vilanova with a poke <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> expulsions for Villa and Özil. Six days later, the Royal Spanish Football Federation opened disciplinary investigations against both Mourinho and Vilanova that could have potentially resulted in a 12-game suspension for Mourinho but instead suspended him for two future Supercopa de España matches and fined €600. Real Madrid was additionally fined €180.|$|E
500|$|The eye is {{a region}} of mostly calm [...] weather {{at the center of}} strong {{tropical}} cyclones. The eye of a storm is a roughly circular area, typically 30–65km (20–40miles) in diameter. It is surrounded by the eyewall, a ring of towering thunderstorms where the most severe weather and highest winds occur. The cyclone's lowest barometric pressure occurs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> can be as much as 15 percent lower than the pressure outside the storm.|$|E
