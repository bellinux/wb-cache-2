5000|$|The {{court held}} {{that in this case}} the users of the systems were the direct <b>infringers,</b> these who are ignorant or more {{commonly}} disdainful of copyright and in any event discount the likelihood of being sued or prosecuted for copyright infringement, however companies such as Aimster that facilitate their infringement, even if they are not themselves direct <b>infringers</b> can be liable for copyright violations as contributory <b>infringers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Opponents {{claim that}} the bill is vague and inefficient because {{copyright}} <b>infringers</b> would only need {{to prove that they}} made a [...] "diligent effort" [...] to locate the copyright owner of a work. The definition of [...] "diligent effort" [...] is vague, and {{it is not clear what}} copyright owners need to do to protect their work from these <b>infringers.</b> This potentially increases the number of <b>infringers</b> since the cost of infringing is not too great, and copyright owners must take more measures to protect their work than before.|$|R
25|$|As a {{trademark}} {{must be used}} to maintain rights in relation to that mark, {{a trademark}} can be 'abandoned' or its registration can be cancelled or revoked if the mark is not continuously used. By comparison, patents and copyrights cannot be 'abandoned' and a patent holder or copyright owner can generally enforce their rights without taking any particular action to maintain the patent or copyright. Additionally, patent holders and copyright owners may not necessarily need to actively police their rights. However, a failure to bring a timely infringement suit or action against a known <b>infringer</b> may give the defendant a defense of implied consent or estoppel when suit is finally brought.|$|E
25|$|The court {{states the}} test for {{copyright}} infringement as copying an item {{that is the subject}} of a valid copyright, making no mention of improper appropriation of protectible elements. This is in contrast to the 2nd Circuit's prior opinion in Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp., 45 F.2d 119 (1930), that infringement occurs only when there is copying and improper appropriation. The Nichols court held that appropriation was not improper when the alleged <b>infringer</b> copied only unprotectible elements of the original work. While it is appropriate to look at both protectible and unprotectible elements of a work to determine whether copying has occurred, only the protectible elements are relevant when it comes to determining improper appropriation. The Steinberg court made no attempt to separate the protectable and unprotectable elements of Steinberg's drawing.|$|E
500|$|Fair {{dealing in}} United Kingdom {{law is a}} {{doctrine}} which provides an exception to United Kingdom copyright law, {{in cases where the}} copyright infringement is for the purposes of non-commercial research or study, criticism or review, or for the reporting of current events. More limited than the United States doctrine of fair use, fair dealing originates in Sections 29 and 30 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, and requires the <b>infringer</b> to show not only that their copying falls into one of the three fair dealing categories, but also that it is [...] "fair" [...] and, in some cases, that it contains sufficient acknowledgement for the original author. Factors when deciding the [...] "fairness" [...] of the copying can include the quantity of the work taken, whether It was previously published, the motives of the <b>infringer</b> and what the consequences of the infringement on the original author's returns for the copyrighted work will be.|$|E

50|$|The Protecting Intellectual Rights Against Theft and Expropriation Act of 2004, {{better known}} as the Pirate Act, was a bill in the United States Congress that would have let federal {{prosecutors}} file civil lawsuits against suspected copyright <b>infringers.</b> Prior to the introduction of this act, only criminal lawsuits could be filed against suspected <b>infringers.</b>|$|R
25|$|Many of the DRM {{systems in}} use are {{designed}} to work on general purpose computing hardware, such as desktop PCs, apparently because this equipment is felt {{to be a major}} contributor to revenue loss from disallowed copying. Large commercial copyright <b>infringers</b> avoid consumer equipment, so losses from such <b>infringers</b> will not be covered by such provisions.|$|R
500|$|The {{quantity}} {{of the work}} taken is also taken into account. If the <b>infringer</b> uses the majority of a copyrighted work, or all of it, they reduce the expected returns of the copyright owner and compromise [...] "the role that copyright plays in encouraging creativity". As such, the fair dealing defence usually only applies when part of a work has been taken, although some judicial comments, {{such as those of}} Megaw LJ in Hubbard, state that there are a few cases in which the work is so short that reproducing it in its entirety may be acceptable. The use made of the work is another factor; if the <b>infringer</b> takes a copyrighted work and reorganises or reinterprets it, the courts are more likely to find that the dealing qualifies as fair than if the work is simply reproduced without modification or analysis. In some situations, the fair dealing defence must be accompanied by [...] "sufficient acknowledgement", where the author and the original work must be identified either by the title or some other description.|$|E
500|$|Fair dealing is a defence {{after the}} fact. If sued for {{copyright}} infringement, one {{can rely on}} fair dealing as a defence in court, but the defence [...] "only comes into play once a claimant has established that copyright has been infringed. Where this occurs, the onus of proof [...] falls on the defendant to prove {{that one of the}} exceptions applies". This is done first by proving that the infringement falls within one of the three categories, which are liberally interpreted by the courts. The courts will not, however, give any consideration to what the <b>infringer</b> thought his work was for, or rely on a subjective test in any way; as in Hyde Park Residence v Yelland, it is not seen as necessary [...] "for the court to put itself in the shoes of the <b>infringer</b> of the copyright". Instead, a more objective test is used, to avoid providing [...] "any encouragement to the notion that all that is required is for the user to have a sincere belief, however misguided, {{that he or she is}} criticising a work or reporting current affairs".|$|E
500|$|Section 30(1) of the 1988 Act {{provides}} that the fair dealing exception is valid if {{the material is}} being copied for criticism or review. For it to apply, the <b>infringer</b> {{must be able to}} show that the dealing was for criticism or review, that the infringed work was previously made available to the public, that the dealing was fair, and that the dealing was accompanied by an acknowledgement. The first step requires the defendant to show that the copying was done to criticise or review the work in question, the performance of the work, or, as in Beloff v Pressdram, another work. The courts will interpret [...] "criticism or review" [...] liberally, as in Newspaper Licensing Agency v Marks & Spencers plc, and as such the criticism or review can include the thought or philosophy of the work, as in Time Warner v Channel 4, or the social and moral implications of the work, as in Pro Sieben Media v Carlton Television.|$|E

The CCI hoped that unwitting <b>infringers,</b> such as those whose home networks have been hijacked by unauthorized users or the parents {{of children who are}} infringing, would use the knowledge that their account is being used for copyright infringement to force users of the account to curtail these activities. The CCI also hoped to increase parents' involvement in what their children are doing online by alerting misconduct and abuse of their accounts.|$|R

500|$|Fair dealing is an {{exception}} to United Kingdom copyright law which allows {{for the use of}} copyrighted works without licensing in certain circumstances. It is governed by Sections 29 and 30 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, which provide three types of situation in which fair dealing is a valid defence: where the use is for the purposes of research or private study, where it is to allow for criticism or review, and where it is for the purpose of reporting current events. This can be contrasted with the United States doctrine of fair use, which provides a general defence rather than rigid and specific categories of acceptable behaviour. Under United Kingdom law, an <b>infringer</b> relying on fair dealing as a defence must show that their actions fall into a specific category of acceptable use, as opposed to the [...] "illustrative open list of purposes" [...] in US law. The fair dealing exceptions had previously been formalised in case law as [...] "fair use" [...] forms, but this was eliminated by the Copyright Act 1911.|$|E
500|$|For this defence to apply, the <b>infringer</b> {{must show}} that the dealing is for {{non-commercial}} research or private study, private study being defined by Section 178 as excluding any study directly or indirectly for commercial purpose; it therefore covers most academic purposes, but not things {{such as the use}} of a database in market-testing of new drugs. Research, when not academic, is covered by The Controller of Her Majesty's Stationery Office, Ordnance Survey v Green Amps Ltd, which sets the test as whether or not it is thought that the research would be used for a commercial purpose in the future. Although the precise distinction between research and private study has not historically been important, modern case law states that there is a difference. Unlike study, research cannot be private, as the exception to copyright law is justified because research provides a benefit to society as a whole. As with all fair dealing exceptions, copying for research or study purposes must also be [...] "fair", taking into account the various factors mentioned above.|$|E
500|$|If the {{copyright}} <b>infringer</b> {{can show that}} their use falls within {{one of the three}} categories, they must then show that the dealing was [...] "fair". This takes into account a number of things, and due to the freedom of speech provisions under the Human Rights Act 1998 is deliberately intended not to be based on rigid and inflexible tests. Instead, as in Ashdown v Telegraph Group Ltd, the courts [...] "bear in mind that considerations of public interest are paramount". Because of this, there are many different things which enhance or detract from the [...] "fair" [...] nature of the dealing. If {{the copyright}}ed work had not been [...] "made available to the public" [...] at the time, this will count against the use being fair, and makes the defence on the grounds of criticism and review [...] "unavailable". The courts will give different weight to different kinds of documents; a series of private letters which have not been published will detract more from the fairness of the infringement than unpublished official reports which discuss matters of public interest.|$|E
40|$|This Article {{studies the}} Federal Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s use of {{excessive}} reasonable royalty awards as a patent infringement deterrent. I argue against this practice, explaining that, properly viewed in {{context of the}} patent system as a whole, distorting the reasonable royalty measure of damages is an unnecessary and ineffective means of ensuring an optimal level of reward for inventors and deterrence for <b>infringers.</b> First, I introduce {{cases in which the}} Federal Circuit and other courts following its lead have awarded punitive reasonable royalty awards and explain the Federal Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s professed rationale for doing so. Next, I demonstrate that this practice makes little sense, given the number of other powerful deterrents already present in the patent system. I also explain that any additional deterrence-related benefits attributable to excess damages are not realized when courts impose those damages against innocent <b>infringers</b> - a group that likely makes up the lion 2 ̆ 7 s share of patent <b>infringers.</b> I further explain that {{there is good reason to}} believe that the patent system already overdeters infringement without the added burden of inflated royalties, because accused <b>infringers</b> participating in a competitive market face strong incentives not to challenge patents asserted against them. Finally, I propose several patent reforms for efficiently deterring deliberate copyists, while sparing innocent <b>infringers</b> from that threat...|$|R
