5|$|Kohlberg {{established}} the Moral Judgement Interview in his original 1958 dissertation. During the roughly 45-minute tape recorded semi-structured interview, the interviewer uses moral <b>dilemmas</b> {{to determine which}} stage of moral reasoning a person uses. The <b>dilemmas</b> are fictional short stories that describe situations {{in which a person}} has to make a moral decision. The participant is asked a systemic series of open-ended questions, like what they think the right course of action is, as well as justifications as to why certain actions are right or wrong. The form and structure of these replies are scored and not the content; over a set of multiple moral <b>dilemmas</b> an overall score is derived.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of Daniel Defoe's Roxana. Through the {{analysis}} of the main character's <b>dilemma,</b> the writer is curious to know how Roxana overcomes her <b>dilemma</b> and the consequence of her decision on the <b>dilemma.</b> The writer is also curious to know how the <b>dilemma</b> and the consequence of her decision on the <b>dilemma</b> lead Roxana to self-realization. The writer intends to find out the ways Roxana overcomes her <b>dilemma</b> and the ways Roxana overcomes the consequence of her decision on the <b>dilemma.</b> Besides, the writer intends to find out that Roxana's <b>dilemma</b> and the consequence of her decision on the <b>dilemma</b> help her to reach selfrealization. In order to achieve the objective goal, the writer uses psychological theories and literary devices namely characterization and conflict. Then, through all of the discussion on the <b>dilemma,</b> the writer finds out that Roxana often faces <b>dilemma</b> between the worldly value and moral value. Besides, Roxana also faces <b>dilemma</b> between doing the right thing or doing the wrong thing. In this case, Roxana has to decide between being honest or dishonest. In order to overcome her <b>dilemma,</b> Roxana often uses rationalization and she always uses everything that gives her benefit. Since Roxana does not know herself well, Roxana always regrets her decision on the <b>dilemma</b> and feels guilty. In order to overcome her regret and guilty feeling, Roxana always deceives herself Furthermore, Roxana's changing heart after she takes decision on her <b>dilemma</b> supports Roxana to do self-analysis. From the discussion of Roxana's self-analysis, the writer sees that Roxana changes from having no understanding about herself till having awareness of her weakest part. The discussion also shows that Roxana's point of view about her way of life has changed. She considers that her way of life in the past is wrong so that she decides to take repentance. Her point of view about money also changes from thinking money {{is the most important thing}} to have opinion that money means nothing...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{dynamics}} of the <b>dilemma</b> zone (DZ) have been realized since {{the concept of the}} <b>dilemma</b> zone was proposed in 1960. The dynamics are a reflection of the dynamical characteristics of the driver-vehicle complex, and can be characterized by the dynamical features of the <b>dilemma</b> zone contributing factors which include the minimum perception-reaction time (PRT) and the maximum deceleration and acceleration rates. To date, the {{dynamics of}} these contributing factors have not yet been well modeled and quantified despite being continuously explored by researchers over decades. In the absence of the quantitative knowledge about these contributing factors, the <b>dilemma</b> zone with assumed constant parameter values, and the Type II <b>dilemma</b> zone defined from a probabilistic perspective (i. e. a zone in which at the onset of yellow interval more than 10 % and less than 90 % drivers would choose to stop) were widely used in practice as alternatives in estimating the <b>dilemma</b> zone. However, both alternatives are compromised in ways, being still incapable of reflecting the <b>dilemma</b> zone dynamics. In fact, the incapacity of modeling and quantifying the <b>dilemma</b> zone dynamics was {{due to the lack of}} reliable and robust vehicular trajectory data during the yellow intervals. The availability of video-capture based software VEVID enabled the collection of high-frequency time-based trajectory data from high-definition digital video and hence offered technical preparedness for modeling the <b>dilemma</b> zone dynamics. The most significant innovation of this paper lies in the proposal of the dynamical <b>dilemma</b> zone model by incorporating the quantitative dynamics into the traditional <b>dilemma</b> zone model. The dynamical contributing factors were identified, quantified, and eventually formulated. Particularly, the models for the contributing factors were developed and validated using separate datasets. The validation results indicated that the models for the dynamical contributing factors are effective in predicting the minimum PRT and the maximum acceleration and deceleration rates under various speed conditions. Specifically, the minimum PRT is a function of individual vehicle's speed; and the maximum deceleration and acceleration rates are functions of both the individual vehicle's speed and the intersection approach's 85 th percentile speed. The final evaluation compared the dynamical <b>dilemma</b> zone with the traditional <b>dilemma</b> zone model, and the Type II <b>dilemma</b> zone model calibrated based on the same trajectory data used for developing the dynamical <b>dilemma</b> zone model. As expected, the evaluation results indicated that the dynamical <b>dilemma</b> zone model estimated the <b>dilemma</b> zone more accurately than the traditional <b>dilemma</b> zone model and the Type II <b>dilemma</b> zone model. This innovation brings advancement in empirical understanding and theoretical modeling of the dynamics of DZ and hence provides theoretical support for developing more efficient and effective <b>dilemma</b> zone protection strategies in the future...|$|R

5|$|Ovine {{obstetrics}} can be problematic. By selectively breeding ewes {{that produce}} multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing; balancing ease of lambing with high productivity {{is one of}} the <b>dilemmas</b> of sheep breeding. In the case of any such problems, those present at lambing may assist the ewe by extracting or repositioning lambs. After the birth, ewes ideally break the amniotic sac (if it is not broken during labor), and begin licking clean the lamb. Most lambs will begin standing within an hour of birth. In normal situations, lambs nurse after standing, receiving vital colostrum milk. Lambs that either fail to nurse or are rejected by the ewe require help to survive, such as bottle-feeding or fostering by another ewe.|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{the authors}} {{proposed}} a quantum prisoner’s <b>dilemma</b> game {{based on the}} spatial game of Nowak and May, and showed that the game can be played classically. By using this idea, we proposed three generalized prisoner’s <b>dilemma</b> (GPD, for short) games based on the weak Prisoner’s <b>dilemma</b> game, the full prisoner’s <b>dilemma</b> game and the normalized Prisoner’s <b>dilemma</b> game, written by GPDW, GPDF and GPDN respectively. Our games consist of two players, {{each of which has}} three strategies: cooperator (C), defector (D) and super cooperator (denoted byQ), and have a parameter γ to measure the entangled rela-tionship between the two players. We found that our generalised prisoner’s <b>dilemma</b> games have new Nash equilibrium principles, that entanglement is the principle of emergence and convergence (i. e., guaranteed emergence) of super cooperation in evolutions of our gener-alised prisoner’s <b>dilemma</b> games on scale-free networks, that entanglement provides a threshold for a phase transition of super cooperation in evolutions of our generalised prison-er’s <b>dilemma</b> games on scale-free networks, that the role of heterogeneity of the scale-free networks in cooperations and super cooperations is very limited, and that well-defined struc-tures of scale-free networks allow coexistence of cooperators and super cooperators in the evolutions of the weak version of our generalised prisoner’s <b>dilemma</b> games...|$|R

5|$|Another {{criticism}} of Kohlberg’s {{theory is that}} people frequently demonstrate significant inconsistency in their moral judgements. This often occurs in moral <b>dilemmas</b> involving drinking and driving and business situations where participants {{have been shown to}} reason at a subpar stage, typically using more self-interest driven reasoning (i.e., stage two) than authority and social order obedience driven reasoning (i.e., stage four). Kohlberg’s theory is generally considered to be incompatible with inconsistencies in moral reasoning. Carpendale has argued that Kohlberg’s theory should be modified to focus on the view that the process of moral reasoning involves integrating varying perspectives of a moral dilemma rather than simply fixating on applying rules. This view would allow for inconsistency in moral reasoning since individuals may be hampered by their inability to consider different perspectives. Krebs and Denton have also attempted to modify Kohlberg’s theory to account for a multitude of conflicting findings, but eventually concluded that the theory is not equipped to take into consideration how most individuals make moral decisions in their everyday lives.|$|E
