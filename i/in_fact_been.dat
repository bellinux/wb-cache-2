5|$|Dyrwood is cursed by the Hollowborn Plague: {{children}} are being born without souls, leaving them totally unresponsive in a way similar to a permanent vegetative state. Many people blame animancers, the scientists who study and manipulate souls. Investigating the curse, the Watcher discovers that the Hollowborns' souls have <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>been</b> stolen by a cult known as the Leaden Key, led by a priest named Thaos, and that Thaos is framing animancers for the Plague. This eventually leads to a riot {{in the capital city}} where animancers are lynched and their college is destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Finucane was {{credited}} with 28 aerial victories, five probably destroyed, six shared destroyed, one shared probable victory, and eight damaged. Included in his total were 23 Messerschmitt Bf 109s, four Focke-Wulf Fw 190s and one Messerschmitt Bf 110. Official records differ over the exact total. After the war, two of Finucane's victories that were credited as probables had, <b>in</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>been</b> destroyed, but were not officially included. His total victory count {{could be as high}} as 32. Some sources credit him this figure.|$|E

5|$|In 1895, surgeon J. W. Ballantyne {{considered}} {{the case of}} the Biddenden Maids from a teratological perspective. He suggested that they had <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>been</b> pygopagus (twins joined at the pelvis). Pygopagus twins are known to put their arms around each other's shoulders when walking, and Ballantyne suggested that this accounted for their apparently being joined at the shoulders in drawings. The pygopagus Millie and Christine McCoy had lived in Britain for a short time before going on to a successful singing career in the United States, and it was known from their case that such twins were capable of surviving to adulthood.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} good {{critical}} reception, the film {{did not perform}} very well at the box office, with only about 35,000 tickets sold domestically. Hamer expressed some disappointment with this, while hoping that the DVD-release would fare better. Internationally, the film did somewhat better, and was sold to forty countries. By early August 2009, the film had <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>been</b> seen by {{more people in the}} United States than in Norway.|$|E
5|$|Samira Rajab, the country's Minister of State for Information (and Rajab's cousin twice over) {{declared}} that Rajab had enjoyed {{a fair trial}} with unrestricted access to legal assistance.

5|$|Until 1818 {{the entire}} Red River Valley {{in what is}} today southeastern Manitoba and northwestern Minnesota was {{considered}} British and was subject to several colonization schemes by the Hudson's Bay Company, particularly the Red River Colony (also known as the Selkirk Settlement) established in 1811. The valley had, <b>in</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>been</b> occupied by Métis since the middle 17th century. The Red River Colony, established to supply the British fur trade, was fraught with problems from the beginning but became important in the Minnesota area's early fur trade as well as supplying many early settlers to the region.|$|E
5|$|While {{there was}} initial {{speculation}} that Mustaine and Ellefson {{might try to}} reunite the Rust in Peace-era lineup, there was initially no statement from the band on the matter. It later came to light that the band had <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>been</b> in discussions with former members Nick Menza (drums) and Marty Friedman (guitar), but were unable to reach an agreement. The opportunity would not arise again, as Menza {{died of a heart}} attack in May 2016.|$|E
5|$|Suzy and Doc are {{attracted}} to each other; she has <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>been</b> quietly tidying his rooms while he is down at the tide pool catching specimens ("The Man I Used to Be"). Fauna tries to persuade Doc, who is very successful with the ladies, to woo Suzy. When Doc is dismissive, Fauna explains {{that she wants to}} get Suzy out of the Bear Flag when it is taken over for the night by a private party. Doc agrees to take Suzy out and treat her like a lady. Fauna goes back to the Bear Flag ("Sweet Thursday"), and works to give Suzy confidence ("Suzy is a Good Thing"). Doc and Suzy's date is the source of great interest to the people of Cannery Row. Both are nervous; Doc wears an unaccustomed necktie, while Suzy tries to act like a lady, but her polish wears thin at times. ("All At Once You Love Her"). At the end of the meal, they decide to continue the evening on a secluded sand dune.|$|E

5|$|The British {{official}} casualty {{return for}} the siege listed 156 killed, 326 wounded and 70 missing. Cornwallis surrendered 7,087 officers and enlisted men in Yorktown when he capitulated and a further 840 sailors from the British fleet in the York River. Another 84 prisoners had been taken during {{the assault on the}} redoubts on October 16. Since only 70 men were reported as missing, this would suggest that 14 of the men officially marked down as ‘killed’ had <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>been</b> captured. This gives a grand total of 142 killed, 326 wounded prisoners and 7,685 other prisoners. Jerome A. Greene mentions a German account that gives much higher figures: 309 killed and 595 wounded.|$|E
5|$|The McCanns began a libel {{action against}} Amaral and his {{publisher}} in 2009. Madeleine's Fund covered the legal fees. In 2015 the McCanns were awarded over €600,000 in libel damages; Amaral's appeal against that decision succeeded in 2016. A judge had issued an injunction against further publication or {{sales of the}} book in 2009, but the Lisbon Court of Appeal overturned the ban in 2010, stating that it violated Amaral's freedom of expression. The ban was reinstated in 2015 {{as part of the}} libel ruling, then lifted when Amaral's appeal succeeded in 2016. The McCanns' appealed the 2016 decision to Portugal's Supreme Court, but the court ruled against them in February 2017; in their 76-page ruling, the judges wrote that the McCanns had not, <b>in</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>been</b> cleared by the archiving of the criminal case in 2008. In March 2017 the Supreme Court rejected the McCanns' final appeal.|$|E
5|$|Tzipori {{later wrote}} in his book that Sharon tricked the Cabinet into believing that the {{confrontation}} with the Syrians was unexpected, and that Sharon had <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>been</b> planning the attack since {{the eve of the}} war. Sharon maintained that on June 6 he had ordered the IDF not to cross the Awali River and to avoid a confrontation with the Syrians. Sharon said he did order the army to prepare for a contingency plan, however, to drive on the Beirut-Damascus highway in case the Syrians attacked first. Eitan claimed that on the night before the operation, he had agreed with Sharon to prepare the IAF for the attack, in case the Cabinet approved it. Senior Israeli commanders said after the operation that Operation Peace for Galilee could have been achieved without confronting the Syrians.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the Russo-Japanese War, Iwate was the {{flagship}} of Rear Admiral Misu Sotarō, commander of the 2nd Division of the 2nd Fleet. She participated in the Battle of Port Arthur on 9 February 1904, when Vice Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō led the Combined Fleet in an attack on the Russian ships of the Pacific Squadron anchored just outside Port Arthur. Tōgō had expected the surprise night attack by his destroyers to be much more successful than it was, anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened, but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack. The Japanese ships were spotted by the protected cruiser , which was patrolling offshore and alerted the Russians. Tōgō chose to attack the Russian coastal defenses with his main armament and engage the ships with his secondary guns. Splitting his fire proved to be a poor decision as the Japanese eight- and six-inch guns inflicted little damage on the Russian ships, which concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships with some effect. Although many ships on both sides were hit, Russian casualties numbered some 150, while the Japanese suffered roughly 90 killed and wounded before Tōgō disengaged. Iwate had, <b>in</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>been</b> considerably damaged in the engagement.|$|E
5|$|By mid-May it {{was clear}} that he would not make the Derby and he was removed from the race on the 23 May. Orme's trainer John Porter and Williams, the {{veterinary}} surgeon, remained convinced that he had been poisoned and was not just suffering from bad teeth. A reward of £1,000 was even offered for information that would lead to the conviction of the guilty party. The poisoning was investigated by George Lewis, a solicitor, who concluded that the horse had been poisoned. He stated that the horse was fine on the morning of the 21 April, but a few hours later his tongue was so inflamed he could not hold it in his mouth; something so sudden, Lewis argued, could not have been caused by a decaying tooth. He suggested that the poison may have <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>been</b> attempted to be administered by some ball being put down his throat, but due to the struggles of the horse, it burst in his mouth, blistering his tongue. The Derby was won by Sir Hugo, but many believed that Orme would have won easily had he made the race.|$|E
