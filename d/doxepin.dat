25|$|Nordoxepin is {{a mixture}} of (E) and (Z) {{stereoisomers}} similarly to <b>doxepin.</b> Whereas pharmaceutical <b>doxepin</b> is supplied in an approximate 85:15 ratio mixture of (E)- and (Z)-stereoisomers and plasma concentrations of <b>doxepin</b> remain roughly the same as this ratio with treatment, plasma levels of the (E)- and (Z)-stereoisomers of nordoxepin, due to stereoselective metabolism of <b>doxepin</b> by cytochrome P450 enzymes, are approximately 1:1.|$|E
25|$|<b>Doxepin</b> is {{extensively}} metabolized by {{the liver}} via oxidation and N-demethylation. Based on in vitro research, the major enzymes {{involved in the}} metabolism of <b>doxepin</b> are the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, with CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 also involved to a lesser extent. The major active metabolite of <b>doxepin,</b> nordoxepin, is formed mainly by CYP2C19 (>50% contribution), while CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 are involved to a lesser extent, and CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 are not involved. Both <b>doxepin</b> and nordoxepin are hydroxylated mainly by CYP2D6, and both <b>doxepin</b> and nordoxepin are also transformed into glucuronide conjugates. The elimination half-life of <b>doxepin</b> is about 15–18hours, whereas that of nordoxepin is around 28–31hours. Up to 10% of Caucasian individuals show substantially reduced metabolism of <b>doxepin</b> that can result in up to 8-fold elevated plasma concentrations of the drug compared to normal.|$|E
25|$|<b>Doxepin</b> {{should not}} be used within 14days of using a monoamine oxidase {{inhibitor}} (MAOIs) such as phenelzine due to the potential for hypertensive crisis or serotonin syndrome to develop. Its use in those taking potent CYP2D6 inhibitors such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, duloxetine, bupropion, and quinidine is recommended against due to the potential for its accumulation in the absence of full CYP2D6 catalytic activity. Hepatic enzyme inducers such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, and barbiturates are advised against in patients receiving TCAs like <b>doxepin</b> due to the potential for problematically rapid metabolism of <b>doxepin</b> to occur in these individuals. Sympathomimetic agents may have their effects potentiated by TCAs like <b>doxepin.</b> <b>Doxepin</b> also may potentiate the adverse effects of anticholinergic agents such as benztropine, atropine and hyoscine (scopolamine). Tolazamide, when used in conjunction with <b>doxepin</b> has been associated with a case of severe hypoglycaemia in a type II diabetic individual. Cimetidine may influence the absorption of <b>doxepin.</b> Alcohol may potentiate some of the CNS depressant effects of <b>doxepin.</b> Antihypertensive agents may have their effects mitigated by <b>doxepin.</b> Cotreatment with CNS depressants such as the benzodiazepines can cause additive CNS depression. Co-treatment with thyroid hormones may also increase the potential for adverse reactions.|$|E
25|$|The major {{metabolite}} of <b>doxepin,</b> nordoxepin (desmethyldoxepin), is pharmacologically active similarly, but {{relative to}} <b>doxepin,</b> {{is much more}} selective as a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. In general, the demethylated variants of tertiary amine TCAs like <b>doxepin</b> are much more potent inhibitors of norepinephrine reuptake, less potent inhibitors of serotonin reuptake, and less potent in their antiadrenergic, antihistamine, and anticholinergic activities.|$|E
25|$|<b>Doxepin</b> is {{eliminated}} {{primarily in the}} urine and predominantly {{in the form of}} glucuronide conjugates, with less than 3% of a dose excreted unchanged as <b>doxepin</b> or nordoxepin.|$|E
25|$|Antagonism of the H1, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, and α1-adrenergic receptors {{is thought}} to have sleep-promoting effects and to be {{responsible}} for the sedative effects of TCAs including those of <b>doxepin.</b> Although <b>doxepin</b> is selective for the H1 receptor at doses lower than 25mg, blockade of serotonin and adrenergic receptors may also be involved in the hypnotic effects of <b>doxepin</b> at higher doses. However, in contrast to very low doses of <b>doxepin,</b> rebound insomnia and daytime sedation are significantly more frequent than placebo with moderate doses (25 to 50mg/day) of the drug. In addition, one study found that although such doses of <b>doxepin</b> improved sleep measures initially, most of the benefits were lost with chronic treatment (by 4weeks). Due to limited data however, more research on potential tolerance and withdrawal effects of moderate doses of <b>doxepin</b> is needed. At these doses of <b>doxepin,</b> dry mouth, an anticholinergic effect, was common (71%), and other side effects such as headache (25%), increased appetite (21%), and dizziness (21%) were also frequently observed, although these adverse effects were notably not significantly more frequent than with placebo in the study in question. In any case, taken together, higher doses of <b>doxepin</b> than very low doses are associated with an increased rate of side effects as well as apparent loss of hypnotic effectiveness with chronic treatment.|$|E
25|$|Like other TCAs, <b>doxepin</b> {{is highly}} toxic {{in cases of}} overdose. Mild {{symptoms}} include drowsiness, stupor, blurred vision, and excessive dryness of mouth. More serious adverse effects include respiratory depression, hypotension, coma, convulsions, cardiac arrhythmia, and tachycardia. Urinary retention, decreased gastrointestinal motility (paralytic ileus), hyperthermia (or hypothermia), hypertension, dilated pupils, and hyperactive reflexes are other possible symptoms of <b>doxepin</b> overdose. Management of overdose is mostly supportive and symptomatic, and can include the administration of a gastric lavage so as to reduce absorption of the <b>doxepin.</b> Supportive measures to prevent respiratory aspiration is also advisable. Antiarrhythmic agents may be an appropriate measure to treat cardiac arrhythmias resulting from <b>doxepin</b> overdose. Slow intravenous administration of physostigmine may reverse some of the toxic effects of overdose such as anticholinergic effects. Haemodialysis is not recommended due to {{the high degree of}} protein binding with <b>doxepin.</b> ECG monitoring is recommended for several days after <b>doxepin</b> overdose due to the potential for cardiac conduction abnormalities.|$|E
25|$|<b>Doxepin</b> {{has been}} {{identified}} as an inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vivo in a study of human patients being treated with 75 to 250mg/day for depression. While it significantly altered metabolic ratios for sparteine and its metabolites, <b>doxepin</b> did not convert any of the patients to a different metabolizer phenotype (e.g., extensive to intermediate or poor). Nonetheless, inhibition of CYP2D6 by <b>doxepin</b> could be of clinical importance.|$|E
25|$|Another study {{assessed}} <b>doxepin</b> and nordoxepin metabolism in CYP2D6 ultra-rapid, extensive, {{and poor}} metabolizers following a single 75mg oral dose. They found {{up to more}} than 10-fold variation in total exposure to <b>doxepin</b> and nordoxepin between the different groups. The researchers suggested that in order to achieve equivalent exposure, based on an average dose of 100%, the dosage of <b>doxepin</b> might be adjusted to 250% in ultra-rapid metabolizers, 150% in extensive metabolizers, 50% in intermediate metabolizers, and 30% in poor metabolizers.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect sizes}} of very-low-dose <b>doxepin</b> in the {{treatment}} of insomnia range from small to medium. These include subjective and objective measures of sleep maintenance, sleep duration, and sleep efficiency. Conversely, very-low-dose <b>doxepin</b> shows relatively weak effects on sleep initiation and does not significantly separate from placebo on this measure. This is in contrast to benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine (Z-drug) hypnotics, which are additionally effective in improving sleep onset latency. However, it is also in contrast to higher doses of <b>doxepin</b> (50 to 300mg/day), which have been found to significantly reduce latency to sleep onset. A positive dose–response relationship on sleep measures was observed for doses of <b>doxepin</b> between 1 and 6mg in clinical studies, whereas the incidence of adverse effects remained constant across this dose range in both young and older adults. However, the incidence of adverse effects appeared to increase with longer treatment duration. A dose of <b>doxepin</b> as low as 1mg/day was found to significantly improve most of the assessed sleep measures, but unlike the 3 and 6mg/day doses, was not able to improve wake time during sleep. This, along with greater effect sizes with the higher doses, was likely the basis for the approval of the 3 and 6mg doses of <b>doxepin</b> for insomnia and not the 1mg dose.|$|E
25|$|<b>Doxepin</b> is well-absorbed {{from the}} {{gastrointestinal}} tract but between 55 and 87% undergoes first-pass metabolism in the liver, {{resulting in a}} mean oral bioavailability of approximately 29%. Following a single very low dose of 6mg, peak plasma levels of <b>doxepin</b> are 0.854ng/mL (3.06nmol/L) at 3hours without food and 0.951ng/mL (3.40nmol/L) at 6hours with food. Plasma concentrations of <b>doxepin</b> with antidepressant doses are far greater, ranging between 50 and 250ng/mL (180 to 900nmol/L). Area-under-curve levels of the drug are increased significantly when it is taken with food.|$|E
25|$|Antidepressant {{doses of}} <b>doxepin</b> {{are defined as}} 25 to 300mg/day, {{although}} are typically above 75mg/day. Antihistamine doses, including for dermatological uses and as a sedative/hypnotic for insomnia, {{are considered to be}} 3 to 25mg, although higher doses between 25 and 50mg and in some cases even up to 150mg have been used to treat insomnia. At low doses, below 25mg, <b>doxepin</b> is a pure antihistamine. At antidepressant doses of above 25mg, <b>doxepin</b> has significant antiadrenergic, antiserotonergic, and anticholinergic effects, and these activities contribute to its side effects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Doxepin</b> at {{a dose of}} 25mg/day for 3weeks {{has been}} found to {{decrease}} cortisol levels by 16% in adults with chronic insomnia and to increase melatonin production by 26% in healthy volunteers. In individuals with neuroendocrine dysregulation in the form of nocturnal melatonin deficiency presumably due to chronic insomnia, very-low-dose <b>doxepin</b> was found to restore melatonin levels to near-normal values after 3weeks of treatment. These findings suggest that normalization of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and the circadian sleep–wake cycle may be involved in the beneficial effects of <b>doxepin</b> on sleep and insomnia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Doxepin</b> is a {{tricyclic}} compound, specifically a dibenzoxepin, and possesses three rings fused {{together with}} a side chain attached in its chemical structure. It is the only TCA with a dibenzoxepin ring system to have been marketed. <b>Doxepin</b> is a tertiary amine TCA, with its side chain-demethylated metabolite nordoxepin being a secondary amine. Other tertiary amine TCAs include amitriptyline, imipramine, clomipramine, dosulepin (dothiepin), and trimipramine. <b>Doxepin</b> {{is a mixture of}} (E) and (Z) stereoisomers (the latter being known as cidoxepin or cis-doxepin) and is used commercially in a ratio of approximately 85:15. The chemical name of <b>doxepin</b> is (E/Z)-3-(dibenzooxepin-11(6H)-ylidene)-N,N-dimethylpropan-1-amine and its free base form has a chemical formula of C19H21NO with a molecular weight of 279.376g/mol. The drug is used commercially almost exclusively as the hydrochloride salt; the free base has been used rarely. The CAS Registry Number of the free base is 1668-19-5 and of the hydrochloride is 1229-29-4.|$|E
25|$|A 2010 review {{found that}} topical <b>doxepin</b> {{is useful to}} treat itchiness.|$|E
25|$|<b>Doxepin</b> is {{a mixture}} of (E) and (Z) {{stereoisomers}} with an approximate ratio of 85:15. When <b>doxepin</b> was developed, no effort was made to separate or balance the mixture following its synthesis, resulting in the asymmetric ratio. (Z)-Doxepin is more active as an inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake than (E)-doxepin. The selectivity of <b>doxepin</b> for inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake over that of serotonin is likely due to the 85% presence of (E)-doxepin in the mixture. Most other tertiary amine TCAs like amitriptyline and imipramine do not exhibit E-Z isomerism or such mixture asymmetry and are comparatively more balanced inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake.|$|E
25|$|As of 2017 {{there was}} no good {{evidence}} that topical <b>doxepin</b> was useful to treat localized neuropathic pain.|$|E
25|$|The H1 {{receptor}} antagonism of <b>doxepin</b> {{is responsible}} for its hypnotic effects and its effectiveness {{in the treatment of}} insomnia at low doses. The incidence of side effects with <b>doxepin</b> and its safety at these doses was similar to that of placebo in clinical trials; the most frequent side effects were headache and somnolence/sedation, both with an incidence of less than 5%. Other side effects sometimes associated with antihistamines, including daytime sedation, increased appetite, and weight gain, all were not observed. Clinical evidence of H1 receptor antagonists and TCAs for the treatment insomnia shows mixed effectiveness and is limited in its quality due to weaknesses like small sample sizes and poor generalizability. However, <b>doxepin</b> is a unique and notable exception; it has been well-studied in the treatment of insomnia and shows consistent benefits with excellent tolerability and safety. Aside from diphenhydramine and doxylamine, which have historical approval as hypnotics, <b>doxepin</b> is the only H1 receptor antagonist that is specifically approved for the treatment of insomnia in the United States.|$|E
25|$|<b>Doxepin</b> {{is widely}} {{distributed}} throughout the body and is approximately 80% plasma protein-bound, specifically to albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein.|$|E
25|$|Its use in {{pregnant}} and lactating women is advised against, although the available preclinical (based on animal studies) evidence suggests {{it is unlikely}} to cause any deleterious effects on fetal development. The lack of evidence from human studies, however, means it is currently impossible to rule out any risk to the fetus and it is known to cross the placenta. <b>Doxepin</b> is secreted in breast milk and neonatal cases of respiratory depression in association with maternal <b>doxepin</b> use have been reported.|$|E
25|$|At {{very low}} doses, <b>doxepin</b> has not shown {{discontinuation}} or withdrawal effects nor rebound insomnia. Sustained effectiveness without apparent tolerance was demonstrated in clinical studies {{of up to}} 12weeks duration. This {{appears to be in}} contrast to over-the-counter antihistamines like diphenhydramine and doxylamine and all other first-generation antihistamines, which are associated with rapid development of tolerance and dependence (by day 3 or 4 of continuous dosing) and loss of hypnotic effectiveness. It is for this reason that, unlike <b>doxepin,</b> they are not recommended for the chronic management of insomnia and are advised for only short-term treatment (i.e., 1week). It is not entirely clear why <b>doxepin</b> and first-generation antihistamines are different in this regard, but {{it has been suggested that}} it may have to do with the lack of selectivity for the H1 receptor of the latter or may have to do with the use of optimal doses. Unlike very-low-dose <b>doxepin,</b> most first-generation antihistamines also have marked anticholinergic activity as well as associated side effects such as dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, and confusion. This is particularly true in older people, and antihistamines with concomitant anticholinergic effects are not recommended in adults over the age of 65. Anticholinergic activity notably may interfere with the sleep-promoting effects of H1 receptor blockade.|$|E
25|$|A 2010 {{review of}} {{treatments}} for chronic hives found that <b>doxepin</b> had been superseded by better drugs {{but was still}} sometimes useful as a second line treatment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Doxepin</b> {{was under}} {{development}} by Winston Pharmaceuticals in an intranasal formulation {{for the treatment}} of headache. As of August 2015, it was in phase II clinical trials for this indication.|$|E
25|$|<b>Doxepin</b> was {{discovered}} in Germany in 1963 and {{was introduced in the}} United States as an antidepressant in 1969. It was subsequently approved at very low doses in the United States for the treatment of insomnia in 2010.|$|E
25|$|Because {{insomnia}} is {{a common}} symptom of depression, antidepressants are effective for treating sleep problems {{whether or not they}} are associated with depression. While all antidepressants help regulate sleep, some antidepressants such as amitriptyline, <b>doxepin,</b> mirtazapine, and trazodone can have an immediate sedative effect, and are prescribed to treat insomnia. Amitriptyline and <b>doxepin</b> both have antihistaminergic, anticholinergic, and antiadrenergic properties, which contribute to both their therapeutic effects and side effect profiles, while mirtazapine's side effects are primarily antihistaminergic, and trazodone's side-effects are primarily antiadrenergic. Mirtazapine is known to decrease sleep latency (i.e., the time it takes to fall asleep), promoting sleep efficiency and increasing the total amount of sleeping time in people with both depression and insomnia.|$|E
25|$|The {{primary use}} of {{trazodone}} is {{the treatment of}} major depression. Data from open and double-blind trials suggest the antidepressant efficacy of trazodone is {{comparable to that of}} amitriptyline, <b>doxepin,</b> and mianserin. Also, trazodone showed anxiolytic properties, low cardiotoxicity, and relatively mild side effects.|$|E
25|$|At doses used {{to treat}} depression, <b>doxepin</b> appears to inhibit the reuptake of {{serotonin}} and norepinephrine and to have antihistamine, adrenergic and serotonin receptor antagonistic, and anticholinergic activities; at low doses {{used to treat}} insomnia {{it appears to be}} selective for the histamine H1 receptor.|$|E
25|$|A study {{assessed}} the metabolism {{of a single}} 75mg oral dose of <b>doxepin</b> in healthy volunteers with genetic polymorphisms in CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 enzymes. In CYP2D6 extensive, intermediate, and poor metabolizers, the mean clearance rates of (E)-doxepin were 406, 247, and 127L/hour, respectively (~3-fold difference between extensive and poor). In addition, the bioavailability of (E)-doxepin was about 2-fold lower in extensive relative to poor CYP2D6 metabolizers, indicating a significant role of CYP2D6 in the first-pass metabolism of (E)-doxepin. The clearance of (E)-doxepin in CYP2C9 slow metabolizers was also significantly reduced at 238L/hour. CYP2C19 {{was involved in the}} metabolism of (Z)-doxepin, with clearance rates of 191L/hour in CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers and 73L/hour in poor metabolizers (~2.5-fold difference). Area-under-the-curve (0–48hour) levels of nordoxepin were dependent on the genotype of CYP2D6 with median values of 1.28, 1.35, and 5.28nM•L/hour in CYP2D6 extensive, intermediate, and poor metabolizers, respectively (~4-fold difference between extensive and poor). Taken together, <b>doxepin</b> metabolism appears to be highly stereoselective, and CYP2D6 genotype has a major influence on the pharmacokinetics of (E)-doxepin. Moreover, CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, as well as patients taking potent CYP2D6 inhibitors (which can potentially convert a CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer into a poor metabolizer), may be at an increased risk for adverse effects of <b>doxepin</b> due to their slower clearance of the drug.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two major}} groups of TCAs in terms of {{chemical}} structure, which most, but not all, TCAs fall into. The groupings {{are based on the}} tricyclic ring system. They are the dibenzazepines (imipramine, desipramine, clomipramine, trimipramine, lofepramine) and the dibenzocycloheptadienes (amitriptyline, nortriptyline, protriptyline, butriptyline). Minor TCA groups based on ring system include the dibenzoxepins (<b>doxepin),</b> the dibenzothiepines (dosulepin), and the dibenzoxazepines (amoxapine). In addition to classification based on the ring system, TCAs can also be usefully grouped {{based on the number of}} substitutions of the side chain amine. These groups include the tertiary amines (imipramine, clomipramine, trimipramine, amitriptyline, butriptyline, <b>doxepin,</b> dosulepin) and the secondary amines (desipramine, nortriptyline, protriptyline). Lofepramine is technically a tertiary amine, but acts largely as a prodrug of desipramine, a secondary amine, and hence is more similar in profile to the secondary amines than to the tertiary amines. Amoxapine does not have the TCA side chain and hence is neither a tertiary nor secondary amine, although it is often grouped with the secondary amines due to sharing more in common with them.|$|E
25|$|Amitriptyline is a {{tricyclic}} compound, specifically a dibenzocycloheptadiene, and possesses three rings fused {{together with}} a side chain attached in its chemical structure.
