5|$|Another {{month of}} {{discussion}} and relatively minor refinement followed, during which several {{attempts were made}} to alter the Rutledge draft, though few were successful.

5|$|Liverpool {{created the}} first chance {{of the game in}} the 20th minute. A pass from John Barnes sent Steve Nicol clear to shoot, but his effort saw the ball roll wide of the far post. Liverpool created a further {{opportunity}} six minutes after – from a free-kick delivered by Barnes on the left, Rush managed to outjump his marker and head the ball <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the Arsenal goal. It however hit the near post and rebounded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> Arsenal goalkeeper John Lukic. Minutes after the half-hour mark, Liverpool scored the opening goal – a long ball from Barry Venison went behind the Arsenal defence and reached Peter Beardsley. Unimpeded, he controlled the ball and shot it with his right foot to score. Arsenal's Kevin Richardson missed a chance to level the scoreline after good play by Lee Dixon; from outside the penalty box he scuffed his shot and the ball went over the crossbar.|$|E
