Four different defects {{are taken into}} account, namely, indentation on the <b>inner</b> <b>raceway,</b> indentation on the roll, sandblasting of the <b>inner</b> <b>raceway</b> and unbalanced cage, besides three severity levels of indentation on the roll are considered. The proposed method exploits soft computing techniques, in particular neural networks and multi classifier systems. We use the Fast Fourier Transform to represent the bearing vibration signals recorded in the time domain by four accelerometers. Whenever possible, simple classifiers, such as LDC and QDC, are used to perform both feature selection and classification. On the other hand, to solve particularly difficult classification problems we adopt Multi-Layer Perceptron neural networks and multi-classifier systems. In particular, three different types of methods of classifier fusion are analysed: maximum, minimum and average. The proposed method shows a good sensitivity as it provides accuracy higher than 99 % in all the experiments related to the recognition of different defects and different severity levels of the defects...|$|E

Therefore, {{it is crucial to}} establish the relationship between geometric error of bearing components and motion error of assembled bearing, which contributes to improving the rotational accuracy of assembled bearing in the design and machining of the bearing. The main purpose of this research is to propose an accurate method for predicting the radial runout of inner ring based on the geometrical constraint model of cylindrical roller bearings. In the geometrical constraint model, dimension and form errors in the <b>inner</b> <b>raceway,</b> the outer raceway, and rollers are considered, and the change of contact positions between the raceways and rollers caused by geometric errors of bearing components is taken into account. This method could predict the radial runout of inner ring after bearing components with geometric error are assembled. In order to testify the validity of the proposed prediction method, two particular cases in which the profiles of the <b>inner</b> <b>raceway</b> are circle and ellipse are selected, and the analysis algorithms for the radial runout of inner ring are derived. Two analytical results obtained from the analysis algorithms validate accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed prediction method...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{mechanism}} of surface rolling contact fatigue (SRCF) in rolling bearings is investigated {{by means of}} dedicated experiments and numerical simulations of the damage progression. Pre-indented <b>inner</b> ring <b>raceways</b> in roller and ball bearings were extensively endurance tested. It is observed that spalls originated from indentations in ball bearings develop initially at {{the trailing edge of}} a pre-indented raceway with a typical V-shaped spall. In this location, the raceway material first detaches {{at the edge of the}} dent, forming a V-shaped damaged area, before growing at fast rate along the raceway. Roller bearings, however, follow the well-known behavior of slowly growing the spall directly across the raceway, before continuing along the rolling path. An existing physically based rolling contact fatigue model able to predict (1) material particle detachment by surface rolling contact fatigue and (2) the effect of the elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) in such a process is adapted and used to simulate the surface damage growth in the two rolling bearing configurations.

40|$|The {{purpose was}} to {{investigate}} how microstructures, especially anisotropy, affects internal stresses and the overall mechanical response of bearings. Samples with the stress axis along the aligned carbide direction possessed high modulus values compared to those with their axis perpendicular to the carbide stringers. The difference in the modulus {{was found to be}} more than a factor of two. A series of experiments was conducted on rolled samples to further investigate this effect; the two sets of results were consistent with each other. The degree of anisotropy of the microstructure in terms of the carbide and matrix orientations was determined using x-ray diffraction. The stress state determination was conducted using neutron diffraction. It was found that there was little variation in the distribution of the internal stresses amongst different samples, indicating that small changes in the processing and geometrical conditions did not result in significant variations in the internal stress. A nominal tensile hoop stress of 39 ksi was obtained for the <b>inner</b> <b>raceway.</b> Furthermore, during the course of the investigation, it was apparent that there was a need to determine the stress state induced by the shrink fitting process. Therefore, a series of experiments was conducted using strain gages to identify the stress distribution in a shrink fitting process in three different types of geometries. Correlations were obtained to estimate the highest stress values in the outer and inner groove geometry. A finite element program based on the ANSYS system was developed to compute the stress distribution in the <b>inner</b> <b>raceway</b> geometry. This analysis indicates that the highest tensile stress in the system occurs at the ID of the ring with a stress value of over 5 times that of the applied radial stress.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess some {{calculation}} methods for quantifying the relationships of bearing geometry, material properties, load, deflection, stiffness, and stress. The scope of the work was limited to two-dimensional modeling of straight cylindrical roller bearings. Preparations for studies of dynamic response of bearings with damaged surfaces motivated this work. Studies were selected to exercise and build confidence in the numerical tools. Three calculation methods were used in this work. Two of the methods were numerical solutions of the Hertz contact approach. The third method used was a combined finite element surface integral method. Example calculations were done for a single roller loaded between an <b>inner</b> and outer <b>raceway</b> for code verification. Next, a bearing with 13 rollers and all-steel construction was used as an example to do additional code verification, including an assessment of the leading order of accuracy of the finite element and surface integral method. Results from that study show that the method is at least first-order accurate. Those results also show that the contact grid refinement has a more significant influence on precision as compared to the finite element grid refinement. To explore the influence of material properties, the 13 -roller bearing was modeled as made from Nitinol 60, a material with very different properties from steel and showing some potential for bearing applications. The codes were exercised to compare contact areas and stress levels for steel and Nitinol 60 bearings operating at equivalent power density.

Such capability is allowing the validation of novel and alternative nondestructive experimental methods of strain measurement or computational models of complex deformation processes. This study describes the first dynamic contact strain measurement of a ball bearing using stroboscopic energy dispersive X-ray diffraction. The experiment probed the dynamic contact strain in the outer raceway of a test bearing. The <b>inner</b> <b>raceway</b> of the bearing was attached to a shaft rotating at 150 revolutions per minute, and the outer raceway, where the measurements were made, was fixed in a stationary bearing housing. A triggering system was used to synchronise the data acquisition of the energy dispersive X-ray diffraction detector with the bearing rotation. Specifically, diffraction data were acquired, stroboscopically, from the material volume within the raceway, in a known location, when the ball was positioned directly below it. A total of 20 s of accumulated diffraction signal was recorded, acquiring 2 ms of data per revolution, providing diffraction patterns of sufficient quality for the dynamic contact strain to be measured. Macromechanical stress field was calculated from the micromechanical strains measured from five lattice planes.

40|$|The {{rolling element}} {{bearings}} are used broadly in many machinery applications. It {{is used to}} support the load and preserve the clearance between stationary and rotating machinery elements. Unfortunately, rolling element bearings are exceedingly prone to premature failures. Vibration signal analysis has been widely used in the faults detection of rotating machinery and can be broadly classified as being a stationary or non-stationary signal. In {{the case of the}} faulty rolling element bearing the vibration signal is not strictly phase locked to the rotational speed of the shaft and become “transient” in nature. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to briefly discuss the identification of an <b>Inner</b> <b>Raceway</b> Fault (IRF) and an Outer Raceway Fault (ORF) with the different fault severity levels. The conventional statistical analysis was only able to detect the existence of a fault but unable to discriminate between IRF and ORF. In the present work, a detection technique named as bearing damage index (BDI) has been proposed. The proposed BDI technique uses wavelet packet node energy coefficient analysis method. The well-known combination of Hilbert transform (HT) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) has been carried out in order to identify the IRF and ORF faults. The results show that wavelet packet node energy coefficients are not only sensitive to detect the faults in bearing but at the same time they are able to detect the severity level of the fault. The proposed bearing damage index method for fault identification may be considered as an ‘index’ representing the health condition of rotating machines...|$|E
40|$|Precise {{prediction}} of {{the lifetime of}} rolling element bearings is a crucial step towards a reliable design of many rotating machines. For bearings subjected to highly varying loads, recent research emphasises a strong reduction of the actual bearing lifetime w. r. t. the classically calculated bearing lifetime. This paper experimentally analyses the influence of external dynamic loads on the lifetime of rolling element bearings. A novel bearing test rig is introduced. The test rig is able to apply a fully controlled multi-axial static and dynamic load on a single test bearing. Also, different types and sizes of bearings can be tested. Two separate investigations are conducted. First, the behaviour of the lubricant film between the rolling elements and raceways is analysed. Increased metallic contact or breakdown of the film during dynamic excitation is investigated {{based on the measured}} electrical resistance through the bearing. The study shows that the lubricant film thickness follows the imposed variations of the load. Variations of the lubricant film thickness are similar to the variations when the magnitude of the static bearing load is changed. Second, wear of the raceway surfaces is analysed. Surface wear is investigated after a series of accelerated lifetime tests under high dynamic load. Due to sliding motion between asperities of the contacting surfaces in the bearing, polishing of the raceway honing structure occurs. This polishing is clearly observed on SEM images of the <b>inner</b> <b>raceway</b> after a test duration of only 0. 5 % of the calculated L 10 life. Polishing wear of the surfaces, such as surface induced cracks and material delamination, is expected when the bearing is further exposed to the high dynamic load. status: publishe...|$|E
