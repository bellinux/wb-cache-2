5|$|An aria for soprano II and obbligato violin {{express the}} praise and adoration of God in vivid coloraturas. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> that Bach {{might have thought}} of the Dresden taste and the {{specific}} voice of Faustina Bordoni.|$|E

5|$|Michel Launey {{argues that}} Classical Nahuatl had a verb-initial basic word order with {{extensive}} freedom for variation, {{which was then}} used to encode pragmatic functions such as focus and topicality. The same <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> for some contemporary varieties.|$|E
5|$|Whedon's use {{of music}} in his {{television}} shows has been regarded as 'filmic', in that he <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> {{to use it to}} remind viewers at 'pivotal moments' of earlier events, resulting in a tighter continuity throughout the season.|$|E
5|$|In practice, the MSE is a {{blend of}} empathic {{descriptive}} phenomenology and empirical clinical observation. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> that the term phenomenology has become corrupted in clinical psychiatry: current usage, as a set of supposedly objective descriptions of a psychiatric patient (a synonym for signs and symptoms), is incompatible with the original meaning which was concerned with comprehending a patient's subjective experience.|$|E

Barry <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>arguing</b> with someone, I <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>arguing</b> with someone, and {{happened to be}} in the same mood. arguments were about absolutely nothing. They were just words. That is what the song is all about; words can make you happy or words can make you sad".|$|R

5|$|It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> {{variously}} {{that the}} Eskaya are {{a remnant of}} the original indigenous settlers on Bohol; that they migrated to Bohol from Sumatra {{in the seventh century}} A.D.; that they are descendants of the resistance groups that fought under Francisco Dagohoy; that they are a cult or secret society; or that they are a conscious reconstruction of an imagined pre-colonial society.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Gartnait son of Áedán could be the same person as Gartnait son of Domelch, king of the Picts, whose death is reported around 601, but this rests on the idea of Pictish matriliny, which has been criticised. Even less certainly, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> that Gartnait's successor in the Pictish king-lists, Nechtan, was his grandson, and thus Áedán's great-grandson.|$|E
5|$|Other {{commentators}} {{have suggested that}} the manner of St Edmund's death, veneration and culthood define him as a sacral king. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> that St Edmund's story was informed by common Celtic and Germanic notions of sacred kingship. Comparable kings who also embodied theories of divinely-ordained rule, rightful sovereignty and the binding links between king, land and society, include: Conaire Mór, Cormac mac Cuilennáin, King Dómaldi and Halfdan the Black.|$|E

5|$|The Roman era of Switzerland is {{traditionally}} held to have ended in 401AD, when Stilicho withdrew all {{troops from the}} Rhine and the Danube. However, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> that the withdrawal was only temporary and partial, and that Roman control of these rivers was reestablished in 411–413 {{with the assistance of}} tribes moving south from Germania.|$|E
5|$|A weary emperor who {{no longer}} cared for the throne, an heir who {{had no desire to}} assume the crown, discontent among ruling circles who were dismissive of the Imperial role in {{national}} affairs: all seemed to presage the monarchy's impending doom. Nevertheless, Pedro II was unconcerned that times and conditions were changing. After more than five decades on the throne, he had become complacent in a belief that the devotion and support of his subjects was immutable. Because of these factors, and the lack of an energetic response on the part of Pedro II, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> that prime responsibility for the monarchy's overthrow rested with the Emperor himself.|$|E
5|$|After Adolf Hitler came {{to power}} in January 1933, Piłsudski is rumored to have {{proposed}} to France a preventive war against Germany. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> that Piłsudski may have been sounding out France regarding possible joint military action against Germany. Lack of French interest may have been a reason why Poland signed the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of January 1934. Little evidence has, however, been found in French or Polish diplomatic archives that such a proposal for preventive war was ever actually advanced.|$|E

50|$|Bolon-Yokte. Together {{with the}} deity Bolon-Yokte (‘Nine-Strides’), god L and god M <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> to {{represent}} the abstract idea of travelling and of movement in space and time.|$|R
5|$|Around {{the turn}} of the millennium, the Arabic {{astronomer}} and polymath Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen) presented a development of Ptolemy's geocentric epicyclic models in terms of nested spheres. Despite the similarity of this concept to that of Ptolemy's Planetary Hypotheses, al-Haytham's presentation differs in sufficient detail that it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> that it reflects an independent development of the concept. In chapters 15–16 of his Book of Optics, Ibn al-Haytham also said that the celestial spheres do not consist of solid matter.|$|E
5|$|As the {{disaster}} in New Orleans intensified, critics charged that Bush was misrepresenting his administration's role {{in what they}} saw as a flawed response. Leaders attacked Bush for having appointed apparently incompetent leaders to positions of power at FEMA, notably Michael D. Brown; it was also argued that the federal response was limited {{as a result of the}} Iraq War and Bush himself did not act upon warnings of floods. Bush responded to mounting criticism by accepting full responsibility for the federal government's failures in its handling of the emergency. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> that with Katrina, Bush passed a political tipping point from which he would not recover.|$|E
5|$|Changing clocks and DST rules has {{a direct}} {{economic}} cost, entailing extra work to support remote meetings, computer applications and the like. For example, a 2007 North American rule change cost an estimated $500million to $1billion, and Utah State University economist William F. Shughart II has estimated the lost opportunity cost at around $1.7 billion USD. Although it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> that clock shifts correlate with decreased economic efficiency, and that in 2000 the daylight-saving effect implied an estimated one-day loss of $31billion on U.S. stock exchanges, the estimated numbers depend on the methodology. The results have been disputed, and the original authors have refuted the points raised by disputers.|$|E
50|$|Women {{generally}} report greater disgust than men, especially regarding sexual disgust {{or general}} repulsiveness which <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> to <b>be</b> consistent with women being more selective regarding sex for evolutionary reasons.|$|R
50|$|It <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> by Dr. Manmohan Singh and {{his party}} that the nuclear {{infrastructure}} needed to be developed more rapidly because the existing electric generation facilities were incapable of meeting growing demand.|$|R
50|$|Quantification is {{also used}} in logic, where it is a formula {{constructor}} that produces new formulas from old ones. Natural languages' determiners <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> to correspond to logical quantifiers at the semantic level.|$|R
5|$|Christian metal bands {{exist in}} most of the subgenres of heavy metal music, and the only common link among most Christian metal bands are the lyrics. The Christian themes are often melded with the {{subjects}} of the genre the band is rooted in, regularly providing a Christian take on the subject matter. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> that the marginal yet transnational Christian metal subculture provides its core members an alternative religious expression and Christian identity, and that the music serves the purpose of offering a positive message through lyrical content. This may not necessarily show a direct connection or reference to the Christian faith but often it does.|$|E
5|$|Ethnographies also caution against over-interpretation of sites. At {{a site in}} Chaco Canyon can {{be found}} a {{pictograph}} with a star, crescent and hand. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> by some astronomers {{that this is a}} record of the 1054 Supernova. However recent reexaminations of related 'supernova petroglyphs' raises questions about such sites in general and anthropological evidence suggests other inrepretations. The Zuni people, who claim a strong ancestral affiliation with Chaco, marked their sun-watching station with a crescent, star, hand and sundisc, similar to those found at the Chaco site.|$|E
5|$|Hill forts {{developed}} in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age, roughly {{the start of the}} first millenniumBC. The reason for their emergence in Britain, and their purpose, has been a subject of debate. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture.|$|E
50|$|The {{opposite}} case <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> by the Chartists , who campaigned from 1838 for a wider reform. The movement petered {{out in the}} 1850s, but achieved most of {{its demands}} in the longer run.|$|R
