5|$|A new form, Lactarius repraesentaneus f. immutabilis, was {{described}} from Le Sappey, in the Haute-Savoie department of southeastern France in 2011. <b>It</b> <b>differs</b> in the staining reaction of its injured flesh.|$|E
5|$|Falco peregrinus ernesti, {{described}} by Sharpe in 1894, is found from Indonesia to Philippines and south to Papua New Guinea {{and the nearby}} Bismarck Archipelago. Its geographical separation from nesiotes requires confirmation. It is non-migratory. <b>It</b> <b>differs</b> from the nominate subspecies in the very dark, dense barring on its underside and its black ear coverts.|$|E
5|$|M. s. melanotus, {{known as}} the black-backed fairywren, was {{described}} by John Gould in 1841 as a separate species. It {{is found in the}} mallee country of South Australia (Sedan area north-east of Adelaide) through western Victoria, western New South Wales and into south western Queensland. <b>It</b> <b>differs</b> from the nominate subspecies in having a black back and whitish lower belly.|$|E

5|$|Mycena mustea {{is another}} similar Mycena that was {{discovered}} and reported concurrently with M.fonticola; <b>it</b> <b>differs</b> in forming a pale grayish purple cap {{with a low}} and broad umbo. Microscopically, it has club-shaped cheilocystidia with several apical short finger-like outgrowths, and nondiverticulate hyphae in the stem cuticle.|$|E
5|$|The series used by Pierre Boulez in his Structures 1a {{is found}} in the {{sketches}} for Threni, but <b>it</b> <b>differs</b> so fundamentally from the row Stravinsky actually used that its relevance to Threni is unclear.|$|E
5|$|The species Pluteus horakianus {{shares with}} P.nevadensis a fragile fruit body, a red cap, and similar cystidial morphology. <b>It</b> <b>differs</b> in its orange-red gill edges, red stem, and cap cuticle cells that contain pigment. Other species with a roughly similar appearance, {{including}} P.aurantiopustulatus, P.aurantipes, P.flammipes, P.laetifrons, and P.laetus, {{can be distinguished}} by differences in microscopic characteristics.|$|E

5|$|Asperger {{syndrome}} (AS), {{also known}} as Asperger's, is a developmental disorder characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. As a milder autism spectrum disorder (ASD), <b>it</b> <b>differs</b> from other ASDs by relatively normal language and intelligence. Although not required for diagnosis, physical clumsiness and unusual use of language are common. Signs usually begin before two years old and typically last for a person's entire life.|$|E
5|$|Belief in the {{existence}} of water bulls persisted in Scotland until at least {{the last quarter of the}} 19th century. As with many mythological creatures, descriptions are imprecise. The water bull is able to shapeshift into human form, and live on land or in water. It can be a monstrous, malevolent black beast, especially when described as a tarbh uisge, but not as nasty as the each uisge or water horse. It can also be amiable and sometimes helpful. <b>It</b> <b>differs</b> from the Manx tarroo ushtey, which is more likely to be a resident of marshland.|$|E
5|$|Coleman has {{speculated that}} modern-day {{prosperity}} theology borrows heavily from the New Thought movement, though {{he admits that}} the connection is sometimes unclear. Jenkins notes that critics draw a parallel between prosperity theology and the cargo cult phenomenon. While citing the popularity of prosperity theology in agrarian African communities, he argues that it can also bear similarities to traditional African religious rituals. J. Matthew Wilson of Southern Methodist University compares the movement to Black theology owing to its focus on uplifting oppressed groups, though he notes that <b>it</b> <b>differs</b> in its concentration on individual success rather than corporate political change.|$|E

5|$|George placed B.aculeata in B.subg. Banksia {{because its}} {{inflorescence}} {{is a typical}} Banksia flower spike; in B.sect. Banksia because of its straight styles; and B.ser. Tetragonae because of its pendulous inflorescences. He considered its closest relative to be B.caleyi, from which <b>it</b> <b>differs</b> in having narrower leaves with fewer, larger lobes; longer perianths, which grade from red to cream rather than from cream to red; shorter pistils; and also differences in the follicles, seeds and flowering time.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Scott Redhead {{reduced the}} species Crinipellis cremoricolor (originally {{described}} by Shaffer and Weaver in 1965, based on specimens found near the University of Michigan Biological Station) {{to a variety}} of C.crinipellis. The variety cremoricolor is found in eastern North America and has longer spores than the nominate variety, measuring 7–12 by 3.8–5µm. According to Shaffer and Weaver, <b>it</b> <b>differs</b> macroscopically from the typical variety in having cream- to buff-colored cap and stem, and pale pinkish-cinnamon gills.|$|E
5|$|In 1997 Birmingham City Council {{decided to}} close the museum and to {{construct}} the brand new ThinkTank museum (since re-christened Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum) in nearby Digbeth. In 2001 the locomotive {{was moved to the}} Thinktank where it remains as at September 2017. <b>It</b> <b>differs</b> significantly from the other two preserved locomotives in that it represents the only untouched example of a British Railways Coronation locomotive.|$|E

50|$|The NeXTcube Turbo was a {{development}} of the earlier NeXTcube. <b>It</b> <b>differed</b> from its predecessor in having a 33 MHz 68040 processor.|$|R
5|$|In Ghana, FES is brewed in Kumasi by Guinness Ghana Breweries, {{which is}} 50.5 per cent owned by Diageo. GFE {{is mixed with}} a locally brewed sorghum lager, but <b>it</b> <b>differs</b> from the Nigerian version in that it {{contains}} no wheat and has {{a higher proportion of}} roast barley. In Ghana, the product is believed to have medicinal properties, strengthening the blood and improving circulation.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>differs</b> in {{appearance}} from the similar greater yellow-headed vulture in several ways. It is smaller and is less heavily built than the greater yellow-headed vulture {{and has a}} shorter, thinner tail. The plumage is browner than the greater yellow-headed vulture's dark, glossy black plumage. Its legs are lighter in color, and its head is more orange-tinged than the more yellow head of the greater yellow-headed vulture. Its flight is also less steady {{than that of the}} greater yellow-headed vulture. The lesser yellow-headed vulture also prefers to live in savannas, as opposed to the preferred forest habitat of the greater yellow-headed vulture.|$|E
5|$|M. kaalae was {{described}} in 2009 {{on the basis of}} a partial skull from the Upper Elliot Formation in Eastern Cape of South Africa. This species is known from the same time and region as some specimens of M. carinatus. <b>It</b> <b>differs</b> from the type species in the morphology of the braincase, as well as in several other characters of the skull such as the proportions of the premaxilla.|$|E

5|$|Mobile device {{forensics}} is a sub-branch {{of digital}} forensics relating to recovery of digital evidence or {{data from a}} mobile device. <b>It</b> <b>differs</b> from Computer forensics in that a mobile device will have an inbuilt communication system (e.g. GSM) and, usually, proprietary storage mechanisms. Investigations usually focus on simple data such as call data and communications (SMS/Email) rather than in-depth recovery of deleted data. SMS data from a mobile device investigation helped to exonerate Patrick Lumumba {{in the murder of}} Meredith Kercher.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys albiventer is a rodent in {{the genus}} Oryzomys of family Cricetidae from {{interior}} western Mexico, {{in the states}} of Jalisco, Guanajuato, and Michoacán. First described in 1901 as a separate species, it was later lumped under O.couesi and the marsh rice rat (O.palustris) until it was reinstated as a species in 2009. <b>It</b> <b>differs</b> from neighboring Oryzomys populations in size and measurements and is a large, brightly colored species with a long tail and robust skull and molars. Its range has been much impacted by agricultural development, but isolated populations are thought to persist.|$|E
5|$|Since Juster did {{the cooking}} for the housemates, if Feiffer wanted to eat, {{he had to}} do the drawings. Feiffer quickly {{realized}} the book would require illustrations of the type and quality that John Tenniel had created for Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and although a nationally-known artist, doubted his competence to do the text justice. Feiffer considers the double-spread illustration of demons late in the book to be a success and one of his favorites. <b>It</b> <b>differs</b> from his usual style (which would involve a white background), and instead uses Gustave Doré's drawings as an inspiration.|$|E
