40|$|Image {{compression}} plays {{vital role}} {{in the field of}} the corporate world, entertainment industry, multimedia, education communications and even at home. The main objective of Image compression is to minimize the size of image in bytes by reducing the redundancy of the image data without degrading the quality of image that results in the reduction of file size so that more images can be stored in a given amount of disk or memory space and also reduces the time required to send the images over the network. Inspired by the recent advancements in the image compression techniques, we proposed an image compression framework based on the pixel-wise fidelity. The proposed method is used to reduce the bit rate of the pixels of the image for the compression by using angular transformation. In the proposed algorithm we used the normalization technique and the <b>inverse</b> <b>sine</b> <b>transformation</b> to get the optimized and compressed image as an output. Finally the results are compared with different methods for MSE, PSNR and the visual appearance after decoding of image...|$|E

The dataset employed is the Irish Household Budget Survey (HBS) 1999 / 2000, which is analysed using a tobit model and doublehurdle model with an <b>inverse</b> hyperbolic <b>sine</b> <b>transformation</b> of the dependent variable.

40|$|The {{dependent}} double-hurdle {{model is}} generalized by an <b>inverse</b> hyperbolic <b>sine</b> <b>transformation</b> {{of the dependent}} variable. The resulting specification features a flexible parameterization, accommodates heteroskedastic errors, and nests a range of common limited dependent variable models. Results for U. S. household cheese consumption suggest that the homoskedastic and normal double-hurdle model is misspecified. Income elasticities are small and vary across household groups. Foodstamp recipients are more responsive to income changes than nonrecipients. Foodstamp recipients are also less likely to consume cheese but, conditional on consumption, spend more than nonrecipients. Copyright 1997, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
40|$|Consider {{variance}} stabilizing {{transformations of}} Poisson distribution [pi]([lambda]), binomial distribution B(n,p) and {{negative binomial distribution}} NB(r,p), with square root transformations for [pi]([lambda]), arcsin transformations for B(n,p) and <b>inverse</b> hyperbolic <b>sine</b> <b>transformations</b> for NB(r,p). We will introduce three terms: critical point, domain of dependence and relative error. By comparing the relative errors of the transformed variances of [pi]([lambda]), B(n,p) and NB(r,p), and comparing the skewness and kurtosis of [pi]([lambda]), B(n,p) and NB(r,p) and their transformed variables, we obtain some better transformations with domains of dependence of the parameters. A new kind of transformation for B(n,p) is suggested. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the role of}} incentive payment programs in eliciting, estimating, and predicting landowners’ conservation enrollments. Using both program participation {{and the amount of}} land enrolled, we develop two econometric approaches for predicting enrollments. The first is a multivariate censored regression model that handles zero enrollments and heterogeneity in the opportunity cost of enrollments by combining an <b>inverse</b> hyperbolic <b>sine</b> <b>transformation</b> of enrollments with alternative-specific correlation and random parameters. The second is a beta-binomial model, which recognizes that in practice elicited enrollments are essentially integer valued. We apply these approaches to Finland, where the protection of private nonindustrial forests is an important environmental policy problem. We compare both econometric approaches via cross-validation and find that the beta-binomial model predicts as well as the multivariate censored model yet has fewer parameters. The beta-binomial model also facilitates policy predictions and simulations, which we use to illustrate the framework. protection, endangered, voluntary, incentive, tobit, beta-binomial, stated preferences...|$|R

The IHS specification is used to overcome the inconsistencies deriving from non-normality of error terms which are typical in censored data. This represents a novelty in R&D studies. The sample employed refers to 1231 Italian firms where the dependent variable under investigation is strongly skewed by the zero values and by the extreme observations. The results show that standard errors are smaller in the IHS model than in the more common logarithmic one. The analysis also shows that size and public grants are effective in determining the level of cooperative R&D expenditure.

40|$|Accurate {{estimates}} of farm-level crop yield probability density functions (PDF’s) are crucial for studying various crop insurance programs and production under risk and uncertainty. Unfortunately, farm-level crop yield PDF’s {{are difficult to}} estimate {{due to the lack}} of sufficient farm yield data. County yield data cover much longer time periods than farm yield data, but using county yield distributions to conjecture about farm yield distributions is dangerous. The theoretical reason is that county yield is the average of correlated farm yields, for which there is no recognizable probability density function (PDF). This paper investigates the relationship between farm and county yield distributions using both statistical theory and the Monte-Carlo simulation method. Results show that under suitable farm yield correlation and density structures, the shape of yield distribution at the farm level is similar to that at the county level. A method is then developed for estimating and simulating farm yield distributions based on county yield PDF estimates and information contained in farm yield data. Six candidate yield models: normal, beta, Weibull, <b>inverse</b> hyperbolic <b>sine</b> <b>transformation,</b> a mixture of normals, and kernel density estimators are applied to Branch County corn yields after detrending nonstationary yield data. Goodness-of-fit results for normal, beta and Weibull distributions show that Weibull best fits county yields. The method for simulating farm yields is illustrated using kernel density estimates...|$|R
40|$|We make a methodological {{contribution}} to the latent class literature by re-examining censored variable analysis within a panel data context. Specifically, we extend the standard latent class tobit panel approach to include random effects, to allow for heteroskedasticity and to incorporate the <b>inverse</b> hyperbolic <b>sine</b> (IHS) <b>transformation</b> of the dependent variable. The IHS transformation ensures robustness to non-normality in the original (untransformed) dependent variable. We then use this framework to model charitable donations, an interesting application given the potential for divergent groups of individuals in the population {{with regard to their}} donating behaviour, which we uncover by a latent class approach. Our findings, which are based on U. S. panel data drawn from five waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, do suggest two distinct classes. There is a clear disparity between the probabilities of zero donations across these classes, with one class dominated by the observed zero givers and associated with relatively low levels of predicted giving. We find clear evidence of both heteroskedasticity and random effects. All IHS parameters were significantly different from zero and different across classes. In combination, these findings endorse the importance of our three modelling extensions...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: This master's thesis {{examines}} {{whether the}} change from local U. K. GAAP to IFRS has any impact on acquisition premiums paid in the U. K. The {{purpose of the study}} is to identify critical changes in acquisition accounting and study whether related changes in future reported earnings are likely to impact premiums paid despite zero impact on the intrinsic target firm value. DATA AND METHODOLOGY: The main sample consists of 178 acquisitions of control among firms listed in the U. K. between announcement dates of 1999 and 2012. Deal data is gathered from SDC, financial data from Worldscope and stock data from Datastream. The data is further complemented manually with CEO compensation, board stock holdings and purchase price allocation information from the annual reports of the acquirer for each transaction. The effect of variables related to IFRS is investigated using OLS regression with and without year fixed effects. The Baseline model is built from scratch by combining relevant literature and statistical methods to maximize adjusted r-square. The dependent variable in cross-sectional regressions is acquisition premium. The main hypothesis suggests that goodwill has a negative correlation with the premium paid and that effect is decreased after the adoption of IFRS. In addition the impact of CEO bonuses, managerial discretion in avoiding goodwill write-offs and the recognition of acquired finite life intangibles to acquisition premium is studied. FINDINGS OF THE STUDY: Before IFRS, goodwill variables correlate negatively and significantly with acquisition premiums. Although after the adoption of IFRS this association stays negative it is not significant anymore. Subsample analysis reveals that goodwill variables have significantly negative coefficients under U. K. GAAP only for transactions where CEOs have reported earnings related incentives. Goodwill recognised in business combinations is further significantly and positively correlated with acquisition premium for same transactions under IFRS. Results, however, do not support the view that organisationally complex firms could pay higher premiums after adopting IFRS due to increased managerial discretion in purchase price allocations.

40|$|We apply {{a latent}} class tobit {{framework}} {{to the analysis}} of panel data on charitable donations at the household level where the latent class aspect of the model splits households into two groups, which we subsequently interpret as "low" donators and "high" donators. The tobit part of the model explores the determinants of the amount donated by each household conditional on being in that class. We extend the standard latent class tobit panel approach to simultaneously include random effects, to allow for heteroskedasticity and to incorporate the <b>inverse</b> hyperbolic <b>sine</b> (IHS) <b>transformation</b> of the dependent variable. Our findings, which are based on U. S. panel data drawn from five waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, suggest two distinct classes of donators.

We find clear evidence of both heteroskedasticity and random effects. In addition, all IHS parameters were significantly different from zero and different across classes. In combination, these findings endorse the importance of our three modelling extensions and suggest that treating the population as a single homogeneous group of donors, as is common in the existing literature, may lead to biased parameter estimates and erroneous policy inference. Although we use this model to explain charitable donations, we note that it has wide applicability for researchers across the social sciences...|$|R
