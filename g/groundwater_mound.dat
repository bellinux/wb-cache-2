A 50 km reach of the Namoi River, Australia, was surveyed. The river is perched up to 16 m above an unconfined aquifer that extends to 30 m below the ground surface. The unconfined aquifer overlies a semi-confined aquifer system. The electrical array consists of two current electrodes near the boat, followed by nine potential electrodes. The sequence of 1 D electrical sounding curves generated was automatically inverted to obtain a layered earth electrical model along the river {{to a depth of}} approximately 40 m. There was weak correlation between the water conductivity measured in boreholes and the layered earth electrical model. Lithological logs from boreholes near the river indicate that the major layers seen in the electrical conductivity cross-section correspond to the major sedimentary units. <b>Groundwater</b> <b>mounding</b> {{in the vicinity of the}} river has been monitored after flooding. The <b>groundwater</b> flood <b>mounds</b> coincide with the location of the predominantly low electrically conductive sediments mapped beneath the river.

Maximummeasured gravity changes associated with the in-filtration were 111 Gal during the first event 2004 and a net 130 -Gal increase during the second event 2005. Gaussian in-tegration of the spatial gravity anomaly yields an anomalous-causative mass within 10 % of the 106 m 3 109 kg of infiltrated water measured in 2004.

30|$|The aim of {{the current}} study is to develop new {{analytic}} model for prediction of <b>groundwater</b> <b>mound</b> in a sloping ditch–drain aquifer system due to multiple localized recharge. The study uses a simple approach to develop analytical expressions for water head distribution in the aquifer due to uniform percolation from a single recharge basin. The solution is then extended to multiple basins of varying recharge rate which are arbitrarily located in the model domain. Unlike previous works based on Laplace transform technique, the current study treats the entire aquifer as a single zone system. Closed form analytic expressions for water head distribution in the aquifer and discharge rate into the ditches are obtained by solving the linearized Boussinesq equation with eigenvalue–eigenfunction method. Some special cases such as no slope and uniform localized recharge are derived as limiting cases of the analytic results.

A comparison was made between two methods used to estimate ground-water mounding: an analytical approach and a numerical approach.

Results predicted that after 1400 days of groundwater level simulation, the maximum rise of the mound was 18 m in the center of the infiltration pond, and it was almost 17 m at the edges of the pond.

All transects were positioned along topographical gradients and monitored over a 20 - 30 year period. The two co-dominant overstorey species (Banksia attenuata and B. menziesii) inhabited a range of topographical positions within the landscape, from dune crest to low lying areas, with only B. attenuata increasing its distribution (moving further downslope) within the transects over time. Both species displayed a reduction in vigour, as indicated by foliage condition, during the monitored period. Species commonly inhabiting low-lying winter-wet areas (e. g. Banksia littoralis, Melaleuca preissiana) showed the greatest loss of tree vigour in response to declining groundwater levels, with B. littoralis replaced by the more drought tolerant B. prionotes. M. preissiana populations were overall more resilient to altered groundwater regimes, responding over a much greater time period (many decades) than B. littoralis (< 10 years). Overall, changes in species distribution and vigour were primarily caused by long-term declines in groundwater levels resulting from the cumulative effects of abstraction and below average annual rainfall (low groundwater recharge). Long-term distribution trends and overall observed reductions in population vigour within the transects may {{be a function of}} the species’ dependency on groundwater to fulfil its water requirements.

40|$|In the {{oil sands}} {{development}} region near Fort McMurray, Alberta, wetlands cover ~ 62 % of the landscape, and ~ 95 % of these wetlands are peatlands. A saline fen was studied {{as a reference}} site for peatland reclamation. Despite highly saline conditions, a freshwater bog was observed {{in the path of}} local saline groundwater flow. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify the hydrological controls that have allowed the development and persistence of a bog in this setting. The presence of bog vegetation and its dilute water chemistry suggest that saline groundwater from the fen rarely enters the bog, which functions predominantly as a groundwater recharge system. Chloride (Cl–) and sodium (Na+) were the dominant ions in fen water, with concentrations averaging 5394 and 2307 mg L- 1, respectively, while the concentrations in bog water were 5 and 4 mg L- 1, respectively. These concentrations were reflected by salinity and electrical conductivity measurements, which in the fen averaged 9. 3 ppt, and 15. 8 mS cm- 1, respectively, and in the bog averaged 0. 1 ppt and 0. 3 mS cm- 1, respectively. A small ridge in the mineral substratum was found at the fen–bog margin, which created a persistent <b>groundwater</b> <b>mound.</b> Under the dry conditions experienced in early summer, groundwater flow was directed away from the bog at a rate of 14. 6 mm day- 1. The convex water table at the fen-bog margin impeded flow of saline water into the bog and instead directed it around the bog margin. However, the <b>groundwater</b> <b>mound</b> was eliminated during flooding in autumn, when the horizontal hydraulic gradient across the margin became negligible, suggesting the possibility of saline water ingress into the bog under these conditions...|$|E

40|$|Current design {{methods for}} {{sustainable}} drainage system infiltration devices, such as soakaways, permeable pavements and infiltration basins, require {{knowledge of the}} empirical soil infiltration coefficient as determined using a soakage test procedure. However, the control that seasonal antecedent hydrological conditions, specifically unsaturated zone soil moisture and water table position, have on the infiltration coefficient is uncertain. This paper uses exploratory numerical modelling to investigate this uncertainty. Results show that antecedent water table position has a significant control on the infiltration coefficient, whilst for a properly conducted test the seasonal antecedent soil moisture is less important. To avoid over-estimating the infiltration coefficient, soakage testing should ideally be performed under the most onerous hydrological conditions and three successive drain downs must be used. Model outputs such as those presented {{can be used to}} reduce the design infiltration coefficient to account for tests made during periods of lower groundwater level and higher design water table positions. Additionally, the current infiltration coefficient calculation is shown to be biased toward the initial, more rapid, infiltration rate. Therefore, an alternative full depth infiltration coefficient calculation is proposed.

For instance, many of the wetlands located on the wellbuffered geomorphic unit called the Spearwood dunes are eutrophic due to high nutrient loads, and drying appears to exacerbate this. On the other hand, many of the wetlands on the leached and poorly buffered geomorphic unit called the Bassendean dunes also have relatively high nutrient inputs but are not eutrophic, and drying appears to cause acidification.

40|$|Abstract Artificial {{recharge}} {{of groundwater}} {{is achieved by}} putting surface water in basins, furrows, ditches, or other facilities where it infiltrates into the soil and moves downward to recharge aquifers. Artificial recharge is increasingly used for short- or long-term underground storage, where it has several advantages over surface storage, and in water reuse. Artificial recharge requires permeable surface soils. Where these are not available, trenches or shafts in the unsaturated zone can be used, or water can be directly injected into aquifers through wells. To design a system for artificial recharge of groundwater, infiltration rates of the soil must be deter-mined and the unsaturated zone between land surface and the aquifer must be checked for adequate permeabil-ity and absence of polluted areas. The aquifer should be sufficiently transmissive to avoid excessive buildup of <b>groundwater</b> <b>mounds.</b> Knowledge of these conditions requires field investigations and, if no fatal flaws are de-tected, test basins to predict system performance. Water-quality issues must be evaluated, especially with respect to formation of clogging layers on basin bottoms or other infiltration surfaces, and to geochemical reactions in the aquifer. Clogging layers are managed by desilting or other pretreatment of the water, and by remedial tech-niques in the infiltration system, such as drying, scrap-ing, disking, ripping, or other tillage. Recharge wells should be pumped periodically to backwash clogging layers. Electronic supplementary material to this paper {{can be obtained by}} using the Springer LINK server ocated a...|$|R
40|$|Karst-related {{flooding}} {{occurs in}} several depressions between Le Roy and Caledonia, NY, USA. The timing of these flood events {{suggests that a}} regional groundwater phenomenon contributes to the flood volumes, in addition to contributions by surface water and subsurface quickflow. To gain {{better understanding of the}} proportions of these components, two watersheds near Le Roy (Britt Road and Quinlan Road) were studied in detail. A rainfall-runoff model was constructed in the PCRaster language to quantify the portion of flood volume originating from surface runoff for two different flood events. For an event in October 2006, runoff explained the entire flood volume in the Quinlan Road watershed. For an event at the end of November 2006, the contribution of surface runoff to the flood volume was about 49 % and 46 % for the Britt Road and Quinlan Road watershed, respectively. The remaining part of the flood volume must have been derived from subsurface quick flow or groundwater. In these model simulations swampy areas and the flood zone were assumed to be impermeable, simulating the presence of a high water table. Without this assumption all the surface water entering the flood zone would infiltrate into the subsurface. From a sensitivity analysis it was found that microtopography storage is an influential parameter in runoff generation in these watersheds. 	These findings suggest that high groundwater levels are the main driving force behind the floodings. Without a groundwater level close to the land surface in the Britt Road watershed or <b>groundwater</b> <b>mounding</b> at the sinkholes in the Quinlan Road watershed, no flooding would occur. However, to accurately quantify the quickflow and groundwater components contributing to the floodings, additional research needs to be performed at the actual time of flooding...|$|R
40|$|Rapid Infiltration (RI), {{which is}} also known as soil aquifer {{treatment}}, is one of the three major land treatment techniques that uses the soil ecosystem to treat wastewater. However, the RI process can treat a much larger volume of wastewater on a much smaller land area than other land treatment concepts. In RI systems, wastewater is applied to shallow basins constructed in deep and permeable deposits of highly porous soils. Wastewater application can be by flooding, or occasionally by sprinklers. Treatment, including filtration, adsorption, ion exchange, precipitation, and microbial action, occurs as the wastewater moves through the soil matrix. Phosphorus and most metals are retained in the soil while toxic organics are degraded or adsorbed. any adverse impact on the adjacent groundwater. It is also possible to use special management approaches that maximize the nitrification and denitrification reactions, or to recycle the portion of the percolate with the highest nitrate concentration. APPLICABILITY RI is a simple and low cost wastewater treatment concept that has been used for more than 100 years. It is applicable for either primary or secondary effluent, and it has been used for treating municipal and some industrial wastewaters.

40|$|A <b>groundwater</b> <b>mound</b> (or {{pressure}} mound) {{is defined}} as a volume of fluid dominated by viscous flow contained within a sediment volume where the dominant fluid flow is by Knudsen Diffusion. High permeability self-sealing groundwater mounds can be created as part of a sustainable urban drainage scheme (SUDS) using infiltration devices. This study considers how they form, and models their expansion and growth as a function of infiltration device recharge. The mounds grow through lateral macropore propagation within a Dupuit envelope. Excess pressure relief is through propagating vertical surge shafts. These surge shafts can, when they intersect the ground surface result, in high volume overland flow. The study considers that the creation of self-sealing groundwater mounds in matrix supported (clayey) sediments (intrinsic permeability = 10 – 8 to 10 – 30 m 3 m – 2 s – 1 Pa – 1) is a low cost, sustainable method which can be used to dispose of large volumes of storm runoff (3 / 24 hr storm/infiltration device) and raise groundwater levels. However, the inappropriate location of pressure mounds can result in repeated seepage and ephemeral spring formation associated with substantial volumes of uncontrolled overland flow. The flow rate and flood volume associated with each overland flow event may be substantially larger than the associated recharge to the pressure mound. In some instances, the volume discharged as overland flow in a few hours may exceed the total storm water recharge to the <b>groundwater</b> <b>mound</b> over the previous three weeks.

40|$|Rainwater {{harvesting}} (RWH), the small-scale {{collection and}} storage of runoff to augment groundwater stores, {{has been seen}} as a solution to the deepening groundwater crisis in India. However, hydrological impacts of RWH in India are not well understood, particularly at the larger catchment-scale. A key element to grasping RWH impact involves understanding the generated recharge variability in time and space, which is the result of variability in rainfall-runoff and efficiency of RWH structures. Yet there are very few reported empirical studies of the impact of RWH. Catchment-scale impacts are best studied using a water balance model, which would require a basic level of field data and understanding of the variability. This study reports the results of a 2 -year field study in the 476 Â km 2 semi-arid Arvari River catchment, where over 366 RWH structures have been built since 1985. Difficulties associated with working in semi-arid regions include data scarcity. Potential recharge estimates from seven RWH storages, across three different types and in six landscape positions, were calculated using the water balance method. These estimates were compared with recharge estimates from monitored water levels in 29 dug wells using the water table fluctuation method. The average daily potential recharge from RWH structures varied between 12 and 52 Â mm/day, while estimated actual recharge reaching the groundwater ranged from 3 to 7 Â mm/day. The large difference between recharge estimates could be explained through soil storage, local <b>groundwater</b> <b>mounding</b> beneath structures and a large lateral transmissivity in the aquifer. Overall, approximately 7 % of rainfall is recharged by RWH in the catchment, which was similar in the comparatively wet and dry years of the field analysis. There were key differences between RWH structures, due to engineering design and location. These results indicate that recharge from RWH affects the local groundwater table, but also has potential to move laterally and impact surrounding areas. However, the greatest weakness in such analysis is the lack of information available on aquifer characteristics, in addition to geology and soil type.

However, significant retardation (absolute and relative) of the gas tracers was not detected. Breakthrough curves of SF 6 and 3 He at two nearby production wells (within ~ 10 m of the pond) were very similar and suggest that nonequilibrium gas transfer was occurring between the percolating water and trapped air. At one well screened between 50 and 90 m below ground, both tracers were detected after 5 days and reached a maximum at ~ 24 days. Despite potential dilution caused by mixing within the production well, the maximum concentration observed at this well was ~ 33 % of the mean pond concentration.

The experiment demonstrates that at artificial recharge sites with high infiltration rates and moderately deep water tables, transport times between recharge locations and wells determined with gas tracer experiments are reliable...|$|R
40|$|Perth is {{a rapidly}} growing city {{and the demand for}} urban land has been {{steadily}} increasing over recent years (D. P. I., 2011) and the meeting of environmental legislations for storm-water management and floodplain strategic management is the kernel around which a variety of skills and deep speculation revolves. Technological advancement and multi-variable calculus have made possible the ability to predict how a given artefact will behave according to a defined series of variables in the environment within which the apparatus is expected to perform its duty. This is to introduce the key role that modelling resembles within the design process. In geological terms, it is known with deposition that Perth is accommodated over a rather variegated spectrum of soil types that ranges from sand, silt, clayey sand and clay. Due to this multi-faceted nature there are no standard design guidelines for subsoil drainage systems at date. A calibrated mathematical model can readily facilitate the design process and decision making thanks to its ability to provide <b>groundwater</b> <b>mounding</b> height values for environments with different physical and hydrogeological characteristics. Subsoil drainage is used throughout the world to control shallow groundwater levels to facilitate land use in both agricultural and urban development. The term subsoil implies that a buried pipe is used as opposed to an open drain, usually where land values are high. The primary mechanism by which subsoil drainage functions is the provision of an outlet from a slotted pipe system such that groundwater can flow by gravity, according to Darcy’s law, towards the pipe thus lowering groundwater levels. Subsoil drainage is usually constructed in parallel or sub-parallel lines, so that the water table mounds between the parallel drainage lines. Critical parameters determining whether a subsoil drainage system operates as intended are: the soil permeability, the volume of water to be drained in unit time and drain spacing. On the Swan Coastal Plain subsoil drainage has been used in urban developments where the water table has been shallow for decades, generally with success owing to the characteristically sandy soils and the relatively low rainfall in the South West of Western Australia. This paper describes a subsoil drainage experimental site in the City of Armadale, instrumented to monitor water table mounding between a set of parallel subsoil drains in imported sand fill in 2009 and 2010. The paper describes the data collected together with application of a suitable model to represent the relevant components of water flux, and an application of that model to design the subsoil drainage systems on the Swan Coastal Plain. It is the contention of this paper that a properly designed and calibrated model is to foresee the rise and decline of the perched water table under a given set of environmental conditions. Doing so, {{it will be possible to}} implement the Best Practice Technique (BPT) while addressing the need to avoid the oversizing of sand-fill requirements and consequent levitation of capital budget, maximise the security of assets and obviate the violation of buildings’ structural integrity. In terms of literature review, it has been deliberately decided to report references that are relevant to the Western Australia scenario solely: this is justified by the unique morpho-geological arrangement of the Swan Coastal Plain; in fact, overseas regulators for urban development may enforce building codes, approval schemes and land sub-divisional requirements that are not parallel to the Australian decisional criteria for such practices...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the interspecific differences in vulnerability to xylem embolism of four phreatophytes – two facultative phreatophytes (Banksia attenuata and B. menziesii) and two obligate phreatophytes (B. ilicifolia and B. littoralis). Species differences at the same position along an ecohydrological gradient on the Gnangara <b>Groundwater</b> <b>Mound,</b> Western Australia were determined in addition to intraspecific differences to water stress between populations in contrasting ecohydrological habitats. Stem- and leaf-specific hydraulic conductivity, as well as Huber values (ratio of stem to leaf area), were also determined to support these findings. We found that where water is readily accessible, there were no interspecific differences in vulnerability to water stress. In contrast both facultative phreatophyte species were more resistant to xylem embolism at the more xeric dune crest site than at the wetter bottom slope site. B. ilicifolia {{did not differ in}} vulnerability to embolism, supporting its classification as an obligate phreatophyte. Other measured hydraulic traits (KS, KL and Huber value) showed no adaptive responses, although there was a tendency for plants at the wetter site to have higher KS and KL. This study highlights the influence site hydrological attributes can have on plant hydraulic architecture across species and environmental gradients...|$|E
30|$|Several {{models have}} been {{developed}} to predict the stream–aquifer interaction under varying hydrological conditions. These {{models have been}} discussed analytically and numerically with and without recharge rate by several researchers. In the past few decades, in order to augment groundwater resources, artificial recharge of unconfined aquifers is applied by means of infiltrating or recharge basins. Many researchers have studied groundwater flow in unconfined aquifers in the presence of recharge through infiltrating basins and have obtained analytical expressions for {{the rise and fall of}} <b>groundwater</b> <b>mound.</b> The linearized solutions of the Boussinesq equation have been derived by many authors. The basic assumption was groundwater flow in isotropic, homogeneous, unconfined aquifers with constant recharge from infiltrating basins which percolates vertically downwards until it approaches the water table. They considered accretion rate is small in comparison with hydraulic conductivity which is almost completely diverted in the direction of the slope of the water table and also one of the assumption is the maximum rise in the water table is small compared with the initial water table height above the base of the aquifer. An exhaustive literature is available where various authors have made their valuable contribution to discuss this phenomenon from different viewpoints.|$|E
40|$|Infiltration {{losses and}} {{recharge}} to groundwater at {{a section of}} Rillito Creek at Tucson, Arizona, were analyzed using data from two flood events in December 1959 and January 1960. Assuming infiltration losses are a function of stream discharge and using empirical equations developed by the U. S. Geological Survey, infiltration loss at the section {{was estimated to be}} 2. 24 x 10 ⁶ m³/km. Estimates of recharge were obtained by two indirect methods: (1) A deconvolution integral in which the impulse response function is derived from the one-dimensional diffusion equation and the output functions are based on well hydrographs. The recharge values ranged between 1. 41 x 10 ⁶ m³/km and 2. 07 x 10 ⁶ m³/km depending on values of aquifer diffusivity obtained from the literature (al = 6, 000 m²/day and (α₂ = 3, 000 m²/day). (2) A <b>groundwater</b> <b>mound</b> method gave a recharge value ranging between 0. 86 x 10 ⁶ m³/km and 1. 29 x 10 ⁶ m³/km depending on the effective porosity values (0. 10, 0. 15). Over all, an average of 70 percent of transmission losses reached and recharged the groundwater reservoir. However, this figure should not be generalized because recharge conditions are favorable in the Rillito Creek area...|$|E
40|$|Climatic {{shifts to}} drier {{conditions}} during drought alter the hydrologic pathways {{of water and}} solute flow to aquatic ecosystems. We examined differences in drought-induced trends in the semiconservative cations, Ca+Mg, in seven northern Wisconsin lakes. These spanned the range of hydrologic settings in the region, including hydraulically <b>mounded,</b> <b>groundwater</b> flowthrough, and groundwater-discharge lakes. Parallel in-creases in concentration across the seven lakes during drought were attributable to evapoconcentration. However, we observed divergent trends for mass, which better reflects altered solute flux by accounting for changes in lake volume. Ca+Mg mass increased in three groundwater-dominated lakes as precipitation inputs were low and groundwater discharging from longer flowpaths became proportionately more important. In contrast, decreases in Ca+Mg mass for two precipitation-dominated lakes reflected diminished inputs of solute-rich groundwater. Landscape position, defined by the spatial position of a lake within a hydrologic flow system, accounted for the divergence in chemical responses to drought. Changes in climate to wetter or drier conditions alter the hydraulic properties of individual lakes and the hy-drologic flowpaths connecting lakes to the landscape. Suc...|$|R
40|$|Ce travail décrit les caractéristiques hydrogéologiques et chimiques de deux lieux d'enfouissement de déchets municipaux localisés au Québec. Le site de Laterrière est en opération depuis 1971 dans une ancienne sablière. Sous les dépôts meubles, la topographie du sotte rocheux est marquée par une vallée qui forme une limite imperméable à l'aquifère de sable et impose un écoulement {{convergent}} de l'eau souterraine vers la rivière Chicoutimi. Le site de Ste-Sophie, en opération depuis 1976, repose sur une couche de 3, 5 mètres de sables fins saturés recouvrant un lit d'argile marine. La surélévation de la nappe dans les déchets favorise un écoulement divergent vers le périmètre de la zone d'enfouissement. Un réseau de piézomètres installé en bordure des deux sites a permis pendant trente mois de prélever des échantillons d'eau et de les analyser. Dans chaque panache de contamination, l'alcalinité, les ions majeurs Na+, K+, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Cl¯, le fer, le manganèse, l'azote total et ammoniacal, les DCO et DBO 5 montrent des concentrations généralement supérieures à celles de L'eau naturelle ambiante. A proximité des deux Lieux d'enfouissement, les teneurs en cadmium, chrome, nickel et plomb excèdent les normes québécoises de potabiLité de l'eau. Dans chaque cas, ta distribution des contaminants est surtout régie par le réseau d'écoulement. La dispersion hydrodynamique et les réactions géochimiques dans le sous-sol sont des processus importants d'atténuation des contaminants. This paper {{describes the}} hydrogeological and geochemical features of two sanitary landfill sites {{located in the}} Province of Quebec : Laterriere and Ste-Sophie. The main objective is to evaluate the leachate attenuation performance of each site. For this project, the Quebec Ministry of the Environment chose two sites with contrasting hydrogeological settings. The Laterriere landfill, in operation since 1971, covers an area of about 32 ha. The refuse is deposited in an old sandpit and the landfill boundary is located 400 meters away from the Chicoutimi River, 25 meters above the stream water level. The bedrock topography shows a valley under the landfill which acts an an impervious base for the sand aquifer and induces a convergent groundwater flow towards the river. The Ste-Sophie landfill covers an area of 48 ha and began operating in 1976. The refuse zone is located on flat ground 350 meters away from the Ruisseau-aux-Castors. The refuse is deposited on a 3. 5 meter layer of fine sands nearly saturated overlying a marine clay bed. A water table mound is observed beneath the landfill, resulting in diverging low lines outward {{from the center of}} the Landfill. For each site, the occurence and migration of contaminants was investigated using networks of piezometers. Sampling was performed monthly over a period of thirty months and thirty parameters were analyzed on each sample. The analytical results were entered in a database and treated by statistical methods. The shape of each contamination plume is controlled mainly by the groundwater flow system. At Laterriere, the plume is restricted to a narrow path between the landfill and the river and inside a bedrock valley. This flow net has been simulated by a two-dimensional finite elements model. At Ste-Sophie, the divergence of flow lines due to <b>groundwater</b> <b>mounding</b> beneath the site causes dispersion of contaminants around the landfill. The use of an analytical solution shows that longitudinal dispersivity is a major process of contaminant migration. For the two landfills, the highest concentrations of contaminants occur directly beneath or close to the boundaries of the landfills. Total alkalinity, Na+, K+, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Cl¯, iron, manganèse, total and ammoniacal nitrogen, chemical and biological oxygen demand (COD and BOD) are much above background levels throughout the plume. Sulfate is also a major contaminant at Ste-Sophie with concentration of 1100 /mg/l. The concentrations of cadmium, chrome, nickel and lead exceed the drinking water standards near the two landfill sites but they decline rapidly in the direction of flow. At Laterriere, the decline in chloride concentration measured at the discharge point S- 23 is about 85 % while the decline of reactive contaminants, such as iron and COD, is respectively 98 and 99. 7 %. Finally, we discuss hydrogeological criteria for landfill site selection in Quebec...|$|R
40|$|The 100 -HR- 3 Groundwater Operable Unit (OU) second Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) 5 -year review (DOEIRL- 2006 - 20, The Second CERCLA Five-Year Review Report for the Hanford Site) set a {{milestone}} {{to conduct an}} investigation of deep hexavalent chromium contamination in the sediments of the Ringold upper mud (RUM) unit, which underlies the unconfined aquifer in the 100 -H Area. The 5 -year review noted that groundwater samples from one deep well extending below the aquitard (i. e., RUM) exceeded both the groundwater standard of 48 parts per billion (ppb) (Ecology Publication 94 - 06, Model Toxics Control Act Cleanup Statute and Regulation) and the federal drinking water standard of 100 {mu}g/L for hexavalent chromium. The extent of hexavalent chromium contamination in this zone is not well understood. Action 12 - 1 from the 5 -year review is to perform additional characterization of the aquifer below the initial aquitard. Field characterization and aquifer testing were performed in the Hanford Site's 100 -H Area to address this milestone. The aquifer tests were conducted to gather data to answer several fundamental questions regarding {{the presence of the}} hexavalent chromium in the deep sediments of the RUM and to determine the extent and magnitude of deeper contamination. The pumping tests were performed in accordance with the Description of Work for Aquifer Testing in Support of the 100 -H Deep Chromium Investigation (SGW- 41302). The specific objectives for the series of tests were as follows: (1) Evaluate the sustainable production of the subject wells using step-drawdown and constant-rate pumping tests. (2) Collect water-level data to evaluate the degree of hydraulic connection between the RUM and the unconfined (upper) aquifer (natural or induced along the well casing). (3) Evaluate the hydraulic properties of a confined permeable layer within the RUM.; (4) Collect time-series groundwater samples during testing to evaluate the extent and persistence of hexavalent chromium in the deeper zones. Use data collected to refine the current conceptual model for the 100 -H Area unconfined aquifer and the RUM in this area. (5) Evaluate the concentration 'rebound' in the unconfined aquifer of hexavalent chromium and the contaminants of concern during shutdown of the extraction wells. Measure co-contaminants at the beginning, middle, and end of each pumping test. The RUM is generally considered an aquitard in the 100 -HR- 3 OU; however, several water-bearing sand layers are present that are confined within the RUM. The current hydrogeologic model for the 100 -H Area aquifer system portrays the RUM as an aquitard layer that underlies the unconfined aquifer, which may contain permeable zones, stringers, or layers. These permeable zones may provide pathways for chromium to migrate deeper into the RUM under certain hydrogeologic conditions. One condition may be the discharge of large volumes of cooling water that occurred near the former H Reactor, which caused a <b>mound</b> of <b>groundwater</b> to form 4. 9 to 10. 1 m (16 to 33 ft) above the natural water table. The cooling water reportedly contained 1 to 2 mglL of hexavalent chromium for corrosion prevention. Three alternate hypotheses for the introduction of hexavalent chromium into the RUM are as follows: (1) Local groundwater with higher concentrations of hexavalent chromium originating from reactor operations at H Reactor was driven by high heads from <b>groundwater</b> <b>mounding</b> in the unconfined aquifer into the RUM via permeable pathways in the upper surface of the RUM. (2) Local groundwater with hexavalent chromium was introduced from the unconfined aquifer via well boreholes, either during drilling or as a result of poor well construction, allowing hydraulic communication between the unconfined aquifer and the RUM. (3) Hexavalent chromium migrated across the Hom area within the more permeable zones of the RUM. The three wells used for the aquifer pumping tests (199 -H 3 - 2 C, 199 -H 4 - 12 C, and 199 -H 4 - 15 CS) exhibit hexavalent chromium contamination in confined aquifer groundwater that {{may be the result of}} one of the mechanisms described above. The purpose of the aquifer testing was to gather data to help refine the conceptual model for the source of deep contamination, examine the potential hydraulic connection between the RUM and the unconfined aquifer, evaluate the hydraulic properties of a confined layer within the RUM, and indicate the extent of hexavalent chromium contamination in the RUM. The results of this study, in conjunction with the recent Hom area investigation (DOE/RL- 2008 - 42, Hydrogeological Summary Report for 600 Area Between 100 -D and 100 -H for the 100 -HR- 3 Groundwater Operable Unit), suggest that the first hypothesis is the most reasonable explanation. The results indicate persistent chromium concentrations over the duration of the tests, suggesting a large-scale emplacement of chromium...|$|R
