40|$|This paper aims at {{segmenting}} cruise {{passengers in}} order to identify passengers' profiles according to their behavior <b>at</b> <b>destination.</b> Through an integrated use of traditional survey instruments and of GPS technologies, a set of indicators for the analysis of passengers' mobility <b>at</b> <b>destination</b> is proposed. Data collected in the port of Palermo are used {{in order to}} investigate space-time activities of cruise passengers <b>at</b> the <b>destination.</b> Monothetic Analysis is used in order to segment passengers according to their behavior <b>at</b> <b>destination,</b> and groups are then compared in terms of socio-demographic characteristics and other variables collected through questionnaire-based survey. Results identify seven different broad patterns of activity, and indicate that several socio-demographic characteristics and other features of passengers seem to be associated with movement patterns <b>at</b> <b>destination.</b> A better knowledge of cruise passengers' behavior <b>at</b> <b>destination</b> is a fundamental pre-requisite in order to better serve visitors' needs and meet their expectations...|$|R
