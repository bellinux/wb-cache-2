2500|$|To {{meet the}} {{reliability}} {{requirements of the}} 1951 US digital computer Whirlwind, [...] "special-quality" [...] tubes with extended life, and a long-lasting cathode in particular, were produced. The problem of short lifetime was traced to evaporation of silicon, used in the tungsten alloy to make the <b>heater</b> <b>wire</b> easier to draw. Elimination of silicon from the <b>heater</b> <b>wire</b> alloy (and more frequent replacement of the wire drawing dies) allowed production of tubes that were reliable enough for the Whirlwind project. The tubes developed for Whirlwind were later used in the giant SAGE air-defense computer system. SAGE computers were dual installations, with one operating, {{and the other in}} standby. To locate potential tube failures in the standby computer, heater voltages were reduced, which caused failures of tubes which would otherwise fail in service. These computers continued in service years after other tube computers had been superseded.|$|E

50|$|Early freezer units {{accumulated}} {{ice crystals}} around the freezing units. This {{was a result}} of humidity introduced into the units when the doors to the freezer were opened condensing on the cold parts, then freezing. This frost buildup required periodic thawing ("defrosting") of the units to maintain their efficiency. Manual Defrost (referred to as Cyclic) units are still available. Advances in automatic defrosting eliminating the thawing task were introduced in the 1950s, but are not universal, due to energy performance and cost. These units used a counter that only defrosted the freezer compartment (Freezer Chest) when a specific number of door openings had been made. The units were just a small timer combined with an electrical <b>heater</b> <b>wire</b> that heated the freezer's walls for {{a short amount of time}} to remove all traces of frost/frosting. Also, early units featured freezer compartments located within the larger refrigerator, and accessed by opening the refrigerator door, and then the smaller internal freezer door; units featuring an entirely separate freezer compartment were introduced in the early 1960s, becoming the industry standard by the middle of that decade.These older freezer compartments were the main cooling body of the refrigerator, and only maintained a temperature of around , which is suitable for keeping food for a week.|$|E

40|$|This report {{contains}} two independent sections. Part one is titled "Terrestrial and Microgravity Pool Boiling Heat Transfer and Critical heat flux phenomenon in an acoustic standing wave. " Terrestrial and microgravity pool {{boiling heat transfer}} experiments were performed {{in the presence of}} a standing acoustic wave from a platinum wire resistance heater using degassed FC- 72 Fluorinert liquid. The sound wave was created by driving a half wavelength resonator at a frequency of 10. 15 kHz. Microgravity conditions were created using the 2. 1 second drop tower on the campus of Washington State University. Burnout of the <b>heater</b> <b>wire,</b> often encountered with heat flux controlled systems, was avoided by using a constant temperature controller to regulate the <b>heater</b> <b>wire</b> temperature. The amplitude of the acoustic standing wave was increased from 28 kPa to over 70 kPa and these pressure measurements were made using a hydrophone fabricated with a small piezoelectric ceramic. Cavitation incurred during experiments at higher acoustic amplitudes contributed to the vapor bubble dynamics and heat transfer. The <b>heater</b> <b>wire</b> was positioned at three different locations within the acoustic field: the acoustic node, antinode, and halfway between these locations. Complete boiling curves are presented to show how the applied acoustic field enhanced boiling heat transfer and increased critical heat flux in microgravity and terrestrial environments. Video images provide information on the interaction between the vapor bubbles and the acoustic field. Part two is titled, "Design and qualification of a microscale heater array for use in boiling heat transfer. " This part is summarized herein. Boiling heat transfer is an efficient means of heat transfer because a large amount of heat can be removed from a surface using a relatively small temperature difference between the surface and the bulk liquid. However, the mechanisms that govern boiling heat transfer are not well understood. Measurements of wall temperature and heat flux near the wall would add to the database of knowledge which is necessary to understand the mechanisms of nucleate boiling. A heater array has been developed which contains 96 heater elements within a 2. 5 mm square area. The temperature of each heater element is held constant by an electronic control system similar to a hot-wire anemometer. The voltage that is being applied to each heater element can be measured and digitized using a high-speed Analog to Digital (A/D) converter, and this digital information can be compiled into a series of heat-flux maps. Information for up to 10, 000 heat flux maps can be obtained each second. The heater control system, the A/D system and the heater array construction are described in detail. Results are presented which show that this is an effective method of measuring the local heat flux during nucleate and transition boiling. Heat flux maps are obtained for pool boiling in FC- 72 on a horizontal surface. Local heat flux variations are shown to be three to six times larger than variations in the spatially averaged heat flux...|$|E

30|$|One {{limitation}} of this method is {{that the amount of}} heat dissipated is reduced as the quantity of water decreases and in case the majority of water is converted into steam as a result of heating. One suggestion is to use water injection along with this method (Harvey et al. 1979). According to Akfhampour (1985), commercially available mineral insulated (MI) cables can be used for producing heat. In this method brine is not needed to conduct electricity instead, two conductors insulated with graphite and polymer are used for the purpose. With the rise of temperature, the mineral resistance also increases which in turn increases the temperature even more. A self-regulating mechanism is achieved which prevents from overheating.

To avoid the need for compressed gas tanks, ambient air is used as the carrier gas, and a vacuum pump is used to pull the carrier gas and injected samples through the wall-coated capillary column and a photoionization detector (PID). At-column heating is used eliminating the need for a conventional oven. The fused silica column is wrapped with <b>heater</b> <b>wire</b> and sensor wire so that heating is provided directly at the column. A PID is used since it requires no external gas supplies and has high sensitivity for many compounds of interest in environmental air monitoring. In order to achieve detection limits in the ppb range, an online multibed preconcentrator containing beds of graphitized carbons and carbon molecular sieves is used.

40|$|A {{microgravity}} {{experiment was}} conducted on the Space Shuttle Endeavor (STS- 108) to observe sustained nucleate boiling of water. Subcooled water was boiled with a single strand and a braid of three 0. 16. mm diameter and 80. mm long Nichrome resistive wires. A CCD video camera recorded the experiment while six thermistors recorded the temperature of the fluid at various distances from the heating element. This paper reports experimental results in observations, measurements, and data analysis. Bubble explosions were found to take place shortly after the onset of boiling for both the single and braid of wires. The explosion may produce a high heat transfer rate, as it generates a cloud of microbubbles. The number, size, and departure rate of the bubbles from the <b>heater</b> <b>wire</b> were measured and compared with theoretical models as a function of time. The temperature measurements revealed a complex temperature distribution in the fluid chamber due to bubbles ejected from the wire that carried thermal energy close to the temperature sensors.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{two types of}} micropumps have been developed: (1) Micropumps to pump gases and (2) self-filling micropumps, which are able to pump gases as well as liquids. Both are {{actuated}} thermopneumatically by heating up gas with a resistive heater and consist of two passive membrane valves for fluid direction. The micropumps are assembled out of three parts only. A single 1, 5 #mu#m thick polyimide membrane, which carries out all movable functions, is mounted between two pump cases out of plastic material. The polyimide layer serves as the highly elastic pump membrane and also serves as valve membranes at its free suspended areas. Micropumps for gases (1) consist of a thinfilm <b>heater</b> <b>wire</b> (thickness: 130 nm), which is located directly on the pump membrane. The micropumps are driven by small electric pulses (2 ms) of typically 2 W at frequencies of up to 30 Hz. At a frequency of 20 Hz flowrates of 400 #mu#l/min are achieved and a maximum counter pressure of 200 hPa is built up. The outer dimensions of these micropumps are 10 x 10 x 1, 2 mm" 3. The polyimide membranes with the heater wires on top are manufactured separately on a silicon substrate and are bonded to the injection-molded pump cases by a new adhesive bonding technique. This technique has been developed to bond together {{a large number of}} microstructures in parallel. Micropumps for gases are manufactured in a small series production and are commercially available. Micropumps for gases and liquids (2) are driven by a <b>heater</b> <b>wire,</b> which is located on the pumpcase in the actuator chamber. The micropumps are self-filling and are able to pump liquids and gases under identical electrical conditions. Liquids may contain air bubbles. The smallest micropumps (2) manufactured have outer dimensions of 2 x 2 x 0, 26 mm" 3. The pump cases of these micropumps are out of polyimide, which is patterned by optical lithography. The micropumps for gases (1) have been developed {{to be used in the}} two microsystems 'Elektrolytanalysator' and 'Optochemischer Schadstoffanalysator' of the Research Centre Karlsruhe. A new fluidhandling concept has been set up especially to handle with polluted liquids. Using micropumps for gases which are working on an air cushion over the system liquids made it possible to manage all fluidical system functions. To trigger the design process a simulation model based on electrical analogies has been developed for a micropump for gases. The discrete circuit model describes the micropump as a coupled nonlinear dynamic system. Closed simulations have been carried out using PSPICE. The validity of the model could be proved by measurements on a number of micropumps in the range of the parameters, that could be adjusted in practice. (orig.) Dissertation submitted by B.
