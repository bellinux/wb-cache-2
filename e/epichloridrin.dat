This article discusses the chemical transformation of glycerol in ethers, acetals and esters of high technological applications, especially in the fuel sector. Glycerol hydrogenolysis, dehydration to acrolein and oxidation are discussed as well, to show the potential use of glycerol for production of plastic monomers. Finally, the article shows other transformations, such as syn gas production, <b>epichloridrin</b> and glycerin carbonate...|$|E
