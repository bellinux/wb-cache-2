40|$|Global changes {{resulting}} from human activities, including {{elevated levels of}} greenhouse <b>gases,</b> <b>enrichment</b> of nitrogen and land use changes, have led to substantial losses in biodiversity of macroscopic organisms, such as plants and animals, but whether these changes will have similar impacts on microscopic organisms, such as bacteria and fungi, is less clear. I examined the impact of three of these global changes, including elevated carbon dioxide, increased soil nitrogen availability and large-scale deforestation, on the biodiversity of soil fungi in three separate ecosystems. The responses of fungi to global changes were variable across ecosystems and the experimental system and were not readily predicted by observed changes in the plant community. However, subtle shifts in the community composition of fungi were observed in response to all global changes. Whether these shifts will impact the ecosystem function of these systems in unclear, but previous studies suggest that even small changes in community dynamics can have large effects on important processes, such as nitrogen cycling and carbon storage. These findings indicate that soil fungi do respond to global changes, but additional research must be undertaken {{to examine the effects}} of these shifts. 10000 - 01 - 0...|$|R

The {{results indicate that the}} Qiongzhusi and the Longmaxi Formations' black shales in this region are mainly deposited in the deep water shelf sedimentary environment. Both the Qiongzhusi and Longmaxi Formations in the southern Sichuan Basin have great organic-rich shale thickness (mainly 50 – 300  m). The marine shales of the Qiongzhusi and the Longmaxi Formations are characterized by high total organic carbon contents (average TOC> 2 %), I–II 1 kerogen types, highthermal maturity level (equivalent RO> 1. 9 %), abundant rich brittle mineral (average >  50 %), micro- and nanometer pore development, as well as high gas content of shale (average >  1. 8  m 3 /t). All these features are favorable for marine shale gas generation and enrichment in the southern Sichuan Basin. Compared to the Barnett shale in North America, in which shale gas has been explored and developed successfully, it is suggested that the Lower Paleozoic in the southern Sichuan Basin would possess good conditions for shale gas accumulation.

Previous detections of metals in intergalactic gas clouds, however, find a heavy element enrichment larger than 1 / 1000 {{times that of}} the solar environment, higher than expected for PopIII remnants. In this letter we report the discovery of a Lyman limit system (LLS) at z= 3. 53 with the lowest metallicity seen in gas with discernable metals, 10 ^- 3. 41 ± 0. 26 times the solar value, at a level expected for PopIII remnants.

40|$|AbstractDuring the {{progressive}} {{exploration of the}} Jingbian Gas Field in the Ordos Basin, multiple gas-bearing regions have been discovered in the dolomite reservoirs in the Middle Ordovician assemblages of Lower Paleozoic in Jingxi area, but these gas-bearing regions and intervals are significantly different in terms of <b>gas</b> <b>enrichment</b> degrees. So far, however, {{the reasons for the}} difference have not been figured out. In this paper, the origin and source of natural gas in the Middle Ordovician assemblages in Jingxi area was investigated on the basis of geochemical data (e. g. natural gas composition and carbon isotope), and then the main factors controlling the gas accumulation were analyzed. It is shown that the natural gas in the Middle Ordovician assemblages in the Middle Ordovician assemblages in Jingxi area is similar to that in the Upper Ordovician assemblages and Upper Paleozoic reservoir in terms of genesis and sources, and they are mainly the Upper Paleozoic coaliferous gas with some oil-derived gas. Under the influence of hydrocarbon generation center of coal source rocks and the source–rock–reservoir contact relationship, the proportion of coaliferous gas increases areally from the north to the south and vertically from Ma 55 sub-member of the Lower Ordovician Majiagou Fm. It is concluded that the natural <b>gas</b> <b>enrichment</b> degree is controlled by the gas charging capacity at the hydrocarbon-supplying windows. Second, the vertical migration and distribution of natural gas is dominated by the differences of Ma 55 −Ma 510 transport pathways. And third, the lateral migration direction of natural gas and the range of gas accumulation are controlled by the superimposition relationship between structures and reservoirs...|$|E

The statistics of laser scanning confocal microscopy observation showed that the microstructural fractures width in the Dibei gas reservoir was mainly 8 – 25  μm, and the associated micro-fractures width was mainly 4 – 10  μm. Additionally, the throat radius was mainly 1 – 4  μm. The fractures width was significantly wider than the throat radius that served as the main channel of in gas flow. In addition, it illustrated that the samples with developed fractures became easier for gas to flow under equal porosity condition, because of lower expulsion pressure, higher mercury injection saturation, and increased gas relative permeability based on the physical simulation experiment of gas charging into core samples with saturated water, mercury injection and gas-water two-phase permeability experiments. Furthermore, it had been concluded that the fractures control tight gas in the following aspects: (1) Fractures play a significant role in reservoir property improvement. The isolated pores were linked by the fractures to form connective reservoir spaces, and dissolution is prone to occur along the fractures forming new pores. The fractures with bigger width are reservoir space as well. (2) Fractures increased fluid flow capacity because it decreased the starting pressure gradient, and it increased gas effective permeability. Thus, fractures improved the gas injection efficiency as well as gas production.

Characteristics of shale <b>gas</b> <b>enrichment</b> in the formation shown by detailed profiling and analysis are summarized as “high, handsome and rich”. “High” mainly refers to the high quality of original materials for the formation of shale with excellent key parameters, including the good type and high abundance of organic matters, high content of brittle minerals and moderate thermal evolution. “Handsome” means late and weak deformation, favorable deformation mode and structure, and appropriate uplift and current burial depth. “Rich” includes high gas content, high formation pressure coefficient, good reservoir property, favorable reservoir scale transformation and high initial and final output, with relative ease of development and obvious economic benefit. For shale <b>gas</b> <b>enrichment</b> and high yield, it is important that the combination of shale was deposited and formed in excellent conditions (geological construction), and then underwent appropriate tectonic deformation, uplift, and erosion (geological transformation). Evaluation based on geological construction (evolution sequence from formation to the reservoir) includes sequence stratigraphy and sediment, hydrocarbon generation and formation of reservoir pores. Based on geological transformation (evolution sequence from the reservoir to preservation), the strata should be evaluated for structural deformation, the formation of reservoir fracture and preservation of shale gas. The evaluation of the “construction - transformation” sequence is to cover the whole process of shale gas formation and preservation.
