5000|$|No current: A <b>dry</b> <b>contact</b> is the synonym of volt free - {{it is not}} [...] "wetted" [...] by {{a voltage}} source. <b>Dry</b> <b>contact</b> can refer to a {{secondary}} set of contacts of a relay circuit which does not make or break the primary current being controlled by the relay. Usually some other contacts or devices have the job of starting or stopping the primary current being controlled. For example, a reed relay matrix switch is normally switched with all contacts dry. After the contacts are all connected, a wire spring relay is energized and connects a supervisory scan point, or main switch, through which the primary current being controlled then flows. Dry contacts are primarily employed in 49 volt or less (low voltage) distribution circuits.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{a study of}} the delectability of <b>dry</b> <b>contact</b> kissing bonds in adhesive joints using three ultrasonic inspection techniques. Conventional normal incidence longitudinal and shear wave inspection were conducted on <b>dry</b> <b>contact</b> kissing bonds using a standard damped ultrasonic transducer and an electro-magnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT) respectively. The delectability of the <b>dry</b> <b>contact</b> kissing bonds was assessed by calculating the reflection coefficient of the imperfect interface at varying loads for a number of surface roughnesses. A high power ultrasonic method was also employed to determine the non-linear behavior of the adhesive interface. The non-linearity of the interface was determined by the ratio of the amplitudes of the first harmonic and fundamental frequencies of the transmitted waveform. It was found that the high power technique showed the greatest sensitivity to these kissing bonds at low contact pressures, however at high loads conventional longitudinal wave testing was more sensitive. It was also noted that a combination of two or more techniques could provide enhanced information about the kissing bond compared to a single technique alone. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The contact of two {{hydrophobic}} {{surfaces in}} water is of importance in biology, catalysis, material science, and geology. A tenet of hydrophobic attraction is {{the release of}} an ordered water layer, leading to a <b>dry</b> <b>contact</b> between two hydrophobic surfaces. Although the water-free contact has been inferred from numerous experimental and theoretical studies, {{this has not been}} directly measured. Here, we use surface sensitive sum frequency generation spectroscopy to directly probe the contact interface between hydrophobic poly-(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) and two hydrophobic surfaces (a self-assembled monolayer, OTS, and a polymer coating, PVNODC). We show that the interfacial structures for OTS and PVNODC are identical in <b>dry</b> <b>contact</b> but that they differ dramatically in wet contact. In water, the PVNODC surface partially rearranges at grain boundaries, trapping water at the contact interface leading to a 50 % reduction in adhesion energy compared to OTS−PDMS contact. The Young−Dupre ́ equation, used extensively to calculate the thermodynamic work of adhesion, predicts no differences between the adhesion energy for these two hydrophobic surfaces...|$|E

For various reasons, but mainly {{in order to}} approximate reality, {{a very large number}} of unknowns are needed. Using classical techniques, the solution of such a system of equations would take too long, and so sometimes MultiLevel techniques are used to accelerate convergence.
