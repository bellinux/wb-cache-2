In {{order to address}} increasing change of reliability problems in power <b>die</b> <b>attachments</b> for high temperature and high reliability applications, sintering Ag nanoparticles {{has been used as}} bonding material for this work. Firstly, quantitative microstructure characterization of as-sintered Ag joints has been carried out. The resulting normalized thickness, pore size and porosity decreased, and grain size increased with increasing the sintering time. A time dependence of the form t 1 /n with n close to 2 or 3 can be further derived for the kinetics of the thinning, densification and grain growth within the sintered Ag joints. From the results can be seen, sintering kinetics is still in the intermediate stage, the densification had not been completed, and Ag grain would continue growing afterwards, which could further explain degradation behaviours of sintered joints during isothermal ageing tests and thermal cycling tests. Secondly, sintered Ag joints with four kinds of substrate metallization have been subjected to isothermal ageing tests at temperatures of 150 °C, 200 °C and 250 °C for up to 32 days. The different microstructure patterns of sintered joints with four substrate finishes during isothermal ageing tests have been presented and compared, which could use the results to explain part of the degradation behaviours of the sintered Ag joints during thermal cycling tests and guide selection of suitable substrate finish for the <b>die</b> <b>attachments</b> in high temperature power electronic system. Furthermore, thermal cycling tests have been carried out to investigate the reliability of two sizes of sintered Ag joints and solder joints during temperature cycling between - 55 °C to 125 °C and - 55 °C to 150 °C. Microstructure evolution of sintered Ag joints was investigated by non-destructive and destructive characterization methods, which revealed the factors which could effect on the degradation during thermal cycling tests. With microstructure features of sintered joints observed from X-ray tomography and SAM, because a specific specimen can be evaluated over its lifetime, a true image of microstructure evolution of damage during operation can be obtained, and crack and degradation can be observed three-dimensionally...|$|R

40|$|Active {{thermal control}} for {{electronics}} on Mars Rovers imposes a serious penalty in weight, volume, power consumption, and reliability. Thus, we propose that thermal control be eliminated for future Rovers. From a functional standpoint {{there is no}} reason that the electronics could not operate over the entire temperature range of the Martian environment, which can vary from a low of approximately equal - 90 C to a high of approximately equal + 20 C during the Martian night and day. The upper end of this range is well within that for conventional electronics. Although the lower end is considerably below that for which conventional [...] even high-reliability electronics is designed or tested, it is well established that electronic devices can operate to such low temperatures. The primary concern is reliability of the overall electronic system, especially in regard to the numerous daily temperature cycles that it would experience over the duration of a mission on Mars. Accordingly, key reliability issues have been identified for elimination of thermal control on future Mars Rovers. One of these is attachment of semiconductor die onto substrates and into packages. <b>Die</b> <b>attachment</b> is critical since it forms a mechanical, thermal and electrical interface between the electronic device and the substrate or package. This paper summarizes our initial investigation of existing information related to this issue, in order to form an opinion whether <b>die</b> <b>attachment</b> techniques exist, or could be developed with reasonable effort, to withstand the Mars thermal environment for a mission duration of approximately I year. Our conclusion, from a review of literature and personal contacts. is that <b>die</b> <b>attachment</b> can be made sufficiently reliable to satisfy the requirements of future Mars Rovers. Moreover, it appears that there are several possible techniques from which to choose and that the requirements could be met by judicious selection from existing methods using hard solders, soft solders, or organic adhesives.

40|$|ObjectiveProximal {{attachment}} failure, often {{leading to}} graft migration, is a severe complication of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Aortic cuffs {{have been used}} to treat proximal attachment failure with mixed results. The Zenith Renu AAA Ancillary Graft (Cook Inc, Bloomington, Ind) is available in two configurations: converter and main body extension. Both provide proximal extension with active fixation for the treatment of pre-existing endovascular grafts with failed or failing proximal fixation or seal in patients who are not surgical candidates. We prospectively compared the outcomes of patient treatment with these two device configurations. MethodsFrom September 2005 to May 2008, a prospective, nonrandomized, postmarket registry was conducted to collect data from 151 patients treated at 95 institutions for proximal aortic endovascular graft failure using the Renu graft. Treatment indications included inadequate proximal fixation or seal, for example, migration, and type I and III endoleak. A total of 136 patients (90 %) had migration, 111 (74 %) had endoleak, and 94 (62 %) had endoleaks and graft migration. AneuRx grafts were present in 126 patients (83 %), of which 89 (59 %) were treated with a converter and 62 (41 %) with a main body extension. Outcomes using converters vs main body extensions for endoleak rates, changes in aneurysm size, and ruptures were compared. ResultsPreprocedural demographics between the two groups did not differ significantly. Procedural success rates were 98 % for the converter group and 100 % for the main body extension group. At a mean follow-up of 12. 8 ± 7. 5 months, no type III endoleaks (0 %) were identified in the converter group, and five (8 %) were identified in the main body extension group. There were no aneurysm ruptures in patients treated with converters (0 %) and three ruptures (5 %) in patients treated with main body extensions. Each patient with aneurysm rupture had been treated with a Renu main body extension, developed a type III endoleak, and underwent surgical conversion. Two of the three patients <b>died</b> postoperatively. ConclusionsProximal <b>attachment</b> failure and graft migration are potentially lethal complications of EVAR. Proximal graft extension using an aortic cuff is the easiest technique for salvaging an endovascular graft. Unfortunately, it has a predictable failure mode (development of a type III endoleak due to component separation) and is associated with a significantly higher failure rate than {{with the use of a}} converter. EVAR salvage with a converter and a femorofemoral bypass is a more complex but superior option for endovascular graft salvage...|$|R
