The Bird explains the nature of probability and that some alternative Earths do exist, and persuades Random to go to one of them. Random challenges the Bird to get her a spaceship there, and just at that moment, one lands. She downs the pilot with a well-thrown rock, and leaves Lamuella.|$|E
5000|$|Five {{minutes before}} the program was to finish running, Earth was {{destroyed}} by the Vogons, allegedly {{to make way for}} a hyperspace bypass but in fact to prevent the Ultimate Question being discovered, as it was seen as a threat to the psychiatric industry.

The dolphins themselves, however, elected not to return. Some time later, the Earth was once again destroyed by the <b>Guide</b> <b>Mark</b> II, acting through the amnesiac Grebulons.|$|E

6000|$|That change {{alters the}} {{perspective}} of every human affair. Things that seemed permanent and final, become unsettled and provisional. Social and political effort are seen from a new view-point. Everywhere the old direction posts, the old <b>guiding</b> <b>marks,</b> have got out of line and askew. And {{it is out of}} the conflict of the new view with the old institutions and formulae, that there arises the discontent and the need, and the attempt at a wider answer, which this phrase and suggestion of the [...] "New Republic" [...] is intended to express.|$|R
5000|$|At the start, the Guide {{is merely}} an {{information}} resource, although one with a distinctly flippant and exuberant tone. Its introduction begins with the words, [...] "Space is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean you may think it's a long walk {{down the road to}} the chemist, but that's just peanuts to space. Listen..." [...] However, in the fifth novel, Mostly Harmless, a new edition of the Guide, the <b>Guide</b> <b>Mark</b> II, is published that is artificially intelligent and capable of interacting with the reader. This Guide, which {{takes the form of a}} black, birdlike robot, appears pleasant and friendly but is in fact deeply malevolent and in league with the Vogons in a plot to destroy Earth. Strangely enough, it saves all the main characters from certain doom as part of some unknown agenda and disappears from existence shortly before the Grebulons destroy Earth at the beginning of the sixth book in the series, And Another Thing by Eoin Colfer.|$|E
