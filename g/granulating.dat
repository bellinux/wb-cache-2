40|$|For the {{separation}} of different plastics we used the melting temperature of the material, sticking to a heated surface. In a laboratory scale a seperation kit was constructed, where mixed <b>granulates</b> of different plastics were seperated by a heated drum, which was feeded by a belt carrying the <b>granulates</b> in a mono-layer. The surface-temperature of the separating drum was selected depending on the melting temperatures of the <b>granulates,</b> starting with the lowest melting temperature of the <b>granulates.</b> <b>Granulates</b> with higher melting temperatures were not collected by the drum and so with increasing temperatures of the seperating drum a step by step separation of different plastic was achieved.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} binders to improve the flowability of <b>granulates</b> and compactibility of Metformin HCL (Met) using the moist aqueous granulation (MAG) process. The effect of the binder moisture content on <b>granulate</b> and tablet quality was also evaluated. Vinylpyrrolidone–vinyl acetate copolymer (Kollidon VA 64 fine: VA 64), polyvidone (Povidone K 12 : PVP), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC SSL SF: HPC) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (Methocel E 5 LV: HPMC) were evaluated as binders. These <b>granulates,</b> except for HPMC, had a lower yield pressure than Met active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). HPMC Met was not sufficiently granulated with low water volume. No problems were observed with the VA 64 Met <b>granulates</b> during the tableting process. However, HPC Met <b>granulates</b> had a bowl-forming tendency, and PVP Met <b>granulates</b> had the tendency to stick during the tableting process. These bowl-forming and sticking tendencies may have been due to the low moisture absorbency of HPC and the high volume of bound water of PVP, respectively. VA 64 Met <b>granulates</b> had the highest ambient moisture content (bulk water, bound water) and moisture absorbency. It was concluded that the type of binder used for the Met MAG process has an impact on <b>granulate</b> flow and compactibility, as well as moisture absorbency and maintenance of moisture balance...|$|R

40|$|New {{research}} by the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) indicates that the health risk of playing sports on synthetic turf pitches with an infill of rubber <b>granulate</b> is virtually negligible. Therefore, it is considered safe for people to play sports on such pitches. The research was conducted following public concerns prompted by the Dutch TV programme Zembla called 'Dangerous Play' in October 2016. RIVM hopes {{that the results of}} the research will help to answer questions from ministries, municipalities, sports clubs and parents. To evaluate the health risks of playing sports on rubber <b>granulate,</b> it is important to determine which hazardous substances are contained in the <b>granulate</b> and to what extent they may be released. Subsequently, it should be examined how people playing sports can come into contact with these substances and whether this can lead to health effects. Rubber <b>granulate</b> contains numerous substances, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), metals, plasticisers (phthalates) and bisphenol A (BPA). These substances were found to be released from the <b>granulate</b> in very low amounts. This is because the substances are more or less 'enclosed' in the <b>granulate,</b> which means that the effect of these substances on human health is virtually negligible. What did RIVM investigate? RIVM determined the substances in rubber <b>granulate</b> from 100 sports pitches that are representative of the synthetic turf pitches in the Netherlands. The institute further performed three types of laboratory tests to examine the release of substances from the <b>granulate</b> if a person playing sport comes into contact with them. These 'migration studies' were used to assess to which extent substances can enter the human body via the skin, via the gastrointestinal tract or via the lungs. This was used to calculate human exposure to the released substances and how this can affect health. In addition, RIVM studied the information available in the scientific literature on substances in rubber <b>granulate,</b> their properties and their health effects. Is there a link with leukaemia? No indications were found in the available literature of a link between playing sports on synthetic turf pitches with an infill of rubber <b>granulate</b> and the incidence of leukaemia and lymphoma. No international research has demonstrated this connection. Moreover, {{it is clear from the}} composition of the rubber <b>granulate</b> that the chemical substances that are capable of causing leukaemia or lymphoma are either not present (benzene, styrene and 1, 3 -butadiene) or are present in a very low amount (2 -mercaptobenzothiazole). Since the 1980 s, a slight rise has been observed in the number of people aged between 10 and 29 who get leukaemia. This trend has not changed since pitches made of synthetic turf were first used in the Netherlands in 2001. Nor does research conducted in the U. S. reveal any increase in the number of new cases of lymphoma in areas where there are relatively many pitches with synthetic turf with an infill of rubber <b>granulate.</b> Information from new American research will be available early 2017. As rubber <b>granulate</b> has been used on football pitches in the United States for a longer period of time (since 1997), it will be possible to analyse over a longer period whether a link exists between playing sports on synthetic turf pitches and getting leukaemia. RIVM is in contact with the researchers and is keeping a sharp eye on the research. Rubber <b>granulate</b> in the environment This research focuses on potential health risks for people who play sports on synthetic turf pitches with an infill of rubber <b>granulate.</b> The research confirms earlier insights showing that the rubber <b>granulate</b> contains metals capable of entering the environment. In particular, zinc was found to be released from the <b>granulate.</b> This metal is not hazardous to humans, but can have consequences for organisms in the soil or surface water. Does rubber <b>granulate</b> meet requirements? Rubber <b>granulate</b> needs to fulfil the regulatory requirements for 'mixtures'. This concentration limit prescribes the maximum permissible amount of certain substances allowed in rubber <b>granulate</b> (there is no limit for how much may be released). This concentration limit concerns substances that are carcinogenic (such as PAHs), hazardous for reproduction or that damage DNA. The amount of PAHs in rubber <b>granulate</b> easily satisfies this concentration limit. The concentration limit for consumer products is far more stringent: it allows far lower amounts of PAHs (100 to 1000 times lower) compared with the concentration limit for mixtures. The amount of PAH in rubber <b>granulate</b> is slightly higher than the concentration limit for consumer products. The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) is currently conducting research to determine a suitable concentration limit for rubber <b>granulate.</b> RIVM recommends adjusting the concentration limit for rubber <b>granulate</b> to one that is closer to the concentration limit applicable to consumer products. Why is rubber <b>granulate</b> used for football pitches? Rubber <b>granulate</b> is finely crushed rubber particles that are usually made from old car tyres. When used as infill on pitches of synthetic turf, it gives the pitch properties similar to normal turf. It means the ball does not roll too fast and does not bounce too high, and makes the synthetic turf better suited to sliding tackles than it would be without the <b>granulate.</b> Synthetic turf pitches can be used intensively all year around and need less maintenance. A lot is invested nowadays in order to reuse old products as a raw material for new products. This also applies to car tyres. The questions that have arisen about the safety of rubber <b>granulate</b> show that tension may exist between the reuse of materials and concerns about the health risks of new products...|$|R
40|$|Glass foam <b>granulate</b> was {{evaluated}} {{for use as}} a horticultural rooting medium with laboratory tests and cultivation experiments. The laboratory tests included moisture characteristics, rehydration rate and pH buffering analyses. Cucumbers and later on tomatoes were propagated in rockwool propagation cubes and planted on slabs of Growstones™ glass foam <b>granulate.</b> They were compared with cucumber respectively tomatoes grown on rockwool slabs. Lab results show that the coarse nature of the glass foam <b>granulate</b> (0. 5 - 5 cm) limits the maximum moisture content to 50 %. The rehydration rate is very high, reaching more than 80 % of container capacity in 5 min. The tested material initially reacts with water, raising the pH to over 10 pH units. Based on lab results a recipe for rinsing the material prior to cultivation was calculated. Cucumber cultivation results show an equal production to plants grown on rockwool. The first yield on glass foam <b>granulate</b> is 1 - 2 days earlier. The susceptibility to Pythium is significantly lower than on rockwool. The wax layer on cucumbers grown on glass foam <b>granulate</b> is perceptibly thicker as consequence of an elevated silicon level of 0. 25 to 1. 6 mmol L- 1 in the slab solution. Tomatoes on glass foam <b>granulate</b> show smaller stem diameters and recovered faster from blossom end rot. Yield levels on glass foam <b>granulate</b> and rockwool are equal. In conclusion growing on glass foam <b>granulate</b> is equally productive as rockwool growing. The material is drier and thus less susceptible to Pythium and more generative in nature. Glass foam <b>granulate</b> can be irrigated with small and frequent irrigation cycles and the material must be rinsed with an acid solution before planting. Small amounts of silicon are released into the nutrient solution...|$|R
