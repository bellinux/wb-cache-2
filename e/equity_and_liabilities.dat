40|$|Abstract. The {{topic of}} {{insolvency}} risk {{in connection with}} life insurance companies has recently attracted {{a great deal of}} attention. In this paper, the question is investigated of how the value of the <b>equity</b> <b>and</b> of the <b>liability</b> of a life insurance company are affected by the default risk and the choice of the relevant bankruptcy procedure. As an exam-ple, the U. S. Bankruptcy Code with Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 bankruptcy procedures is used. Grosen and Jørgensen’s (2002) contingent claim model, implying only a Chapter 7 bankruptcy procedure, is extended to allow for more general bankruptcy procedures such as Chapter 11. Thus, more realistically, default and liquidation are modelled as distin-guishable events. This is realized by using so–called standard and cumulative Parisian barrier option frameworks. It is shown that these options have appealing interpretations in terms of the bankruptcy mechanism. Furthermore, a number of representative numer-ical analyses and comparative statics are performed in order to investigate the effects of different parameter changes on the values of the insurance company’s <b>equity</b> <b>and</b> <b>liability,</b> <b>and</b> hence on the value of the life insurance contract. To complete the analysis, the short-fall probabilities of the insurance company implied by the proposed models are computed and compared...|$|R

The presentation linkbase, using parent-child relations organizes elements in this way and helps users find concepts they are interested in.The main drawback of a tree-like (hierarchical) structure in a presentation linkbase is that it only allows the presentation of flat lists of elements, while financial statements also contain more sophisticated reports such as Changes in Equity or Movements in Property, Plant and Equipment [...] The XBRL Consortium is currently working on rendering solutions that would provide for the automatic creation of such reports.|$|E

40|$|We use simple {{economic}} insights {{to develop}} a framework for distinguishing between prejudice and statistical discrimination using observational data. We focus our inquiry on the enormous literature in healthcare where treatment disparities by race and gender are not explained by access, preferences, or severity. But treatment disparities, by themselves, cannot distinguish between two competing views of provider behavior. Physicians may consciously or unconsciously withhold treatment from minority groups despite similar benefits (prejudice) or because race and gender are associated with lower benefit from treatment (statistical discrimination). We demonstrate that these two views can only be distinguished using data on patient outcomes: for patients with the same propensity to be treated, prejudice implies a higher return from treatment for treated minorities, while statistical discrimination implies that returns are equalized. Using data on heart attack treatments, we do not find empirical support for prejudice-based explanations. Despite receiving less treatment, women and blacks receive slightly lower benefits from treatment, perhaps due to higher stroke risk, delays in seeking care, and providers over-treating minorities due to <b>equity</b> <b>and</b> <b>liability</b> concerns. ...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{the work}} of Eisenberg and Noe [2001], Suzuki [2002], Elsinger [2009] and Fischer [2014], we {{consider}} a generalization of Merton's asset valuation approach where n firms are linked by cross-ownership of <b>equities</b> <b>and</b> <b>liabilities.</b> Each firm is assumed to have a single outstanding liability, whereas its assets consist of one system-exogenous asset, as well as system-endogenous assets comprising some fraction of other firms' <b>equity</b> <b>and</b> <b>liability,</b> respectively. Following Fischer [2014], one can obtain no-arbitrage prices of <b>equity</b> <b>and</b> the recovery claims of liabilities as solutions of a fixed point problem, and hence obtain no-arbitrage prices of the `firm value' of each firm, which is the value of the firm's liability plus the firm's equity. In a first step, we consider the two-firm case where explicit formulae for the no-arbitrage prices of the firm values are available (cf. Suzuki [2002]). Since firm values are derivatives of exogenous asset values, the distribution of firm values at maturity can be determined from the distribution of exogenous asset values. The Merton model and most of its known extensions do not account for the cross-ownership structure of the assets owned by the firm. Therefore the assumption of lognormally distributed exogenous assets leads to lognormally distributed firm values in such models, as the values of the <b>liability</b> <b>and</b> the <b>equity</b> add up to the exogenous asset's value (which has lognormal distribution by assumption). Our work therefore starts from lognormally distributed exogenous assets and reveals how cross-ownership, when correctly accounted for in the valuation process, affects the distribution of the firm value, which is not lognormal anymore. In a simulation study we examine the impact of several parameters (amount of cross-ownership of debt <b>and</b> <b>equity,</b> ratio of <b>liabilities</b> to expected exogenous assets value) on the differences between the distribution of firm values obtained from our model and correspondingly matched lognormal distributions. It becomes clear that the assumption of lognormally distributed firm values may lead to both over- and underestimation of the “true" firm values (within the cross-ownership model) and consequently of bankruptcy risk, too. In a second step, the bankruptcy risk of one firm within the system is analyzed in more detail in a further simulation study, revealing that the correct incorporation of cross-ownership in the valuation procedure is the more important, the tighter the cross-ownership structure between the two firms. Furthermore, depending on the considered type of cross-ownership (debt or equity), the assumption of lognormally distributed firm values is likely to result in an over- resp. underestimation of the actual probability of default. In a similar vein, we consider the Value-at-Risk (VaR) of a firm in the system, which we calculate as the negative α-quantile of the firm value at maturity minus the firm's risk neutral price in t= 0, i. e. we consider the (1 -α) 100...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two independent essays on banking, corporate capital structure, and the real economy, with evidence from China and the United States. The first essay examines how relationship bank health affects a firm’s debt choices. After identifying firms’ own relationship banks, we apply logistic regression on rated firms in the US between 1998 and 2013. We find that, when the leverage of a firm’s relationship bank decreases, the firm {{will be more likely}} to issue public bonds. The leverage of the whole banking sector has a similar impact, which is 1. 35 times that of a firm’s relationship bank’s leverage. As for contract design changes, average loan size slightly decreased, while average bond size significantly increased; the maturity of both loans and bonds significantly shortened; the cost of loans and bonds rocketed to a very high level during the crisis period. Overall, this essay provides evidence of the supply-side effect of corporate debt structure and shows that bank health and leverage have an effect on firms’ choices between bank loans and public bonds. This essay adds to the literature by putting forward a new credit supply-side effect, to understand how firms’ debt structure varies, a matter which has been much explored with regard to demand-side effect. Apart from that, we use a more general and direct measure to capture bank health and its lending behaviour through the effect of leverage. The second essay examines the cyclicality of <b>equity</b> <b>and</b> <b>liabilities</b> financing of listed firms in China. First we find that simple correlation does not give us robust cyclicality results. We argue that this is largely due to small observations in calculating simple correlations. Next, we perform panel regressions controlling firm characteristics and year and firm fixed effects. We find that equity financing is pro-cyclical for all firm groups, while liabilities financing is pro-cyclical for only mid-large firm groups. To finance asset increment during economic recovery, small firms rely more on equity financing, while large firms rely more on liabilities financing. Lastly, we examine the cyclicality of corporate leverage using the same framework. We find that only some large firms’ leverages move counter-cyclically with the real economy. The similar cyclicality of equity finance and liabilities finance cancels each other such that the cyclicality of corporate leverage is affected and differs across different firms. Overall, this essay shows that economic conditions affect <b>equity</b> <b>and</b> <b>liabilities</b> financing of Chinese listed firms. Most firms have similar pro-cyclicality of equity and debt financing. Compared with firms in the US, firms in China rely more on equity markets but less on liabilities markets during economic upturn, especially for small firms. This essay adds to the literature by applying standard methodologies to listed firms in China, to make comparisons with US firms. More importantly, this essay shows that the discrepancy in the results of corporate leverage cyclicality in Chinese literature is understandable and is partly due to the similar cyclicality pattern of <b>equity</b> <b>and</b> <b>liabilities</b> finance. published_or_final_versionEconomics and FinanceDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

IASB is trying to create a new way of classifying this kind of instruments. Contingent Convertibles (CoCos), a hybrid financial instrument, have since 2009 become a popular way for banks to reach their capital requirements. This paper seeks to determine if CoCos are perceived by the market as equity or liability. Previous studies indicate that CoCos act to decrease the risk of banks when looking at the potential for bankruptcy and future solvency problems. Our sample consists of 40 listed banks from 2009 until 2015 in EU, including Norway and Switzerland, who follow IFRS. To understand whether CoCos share key characteristics with equity or liability two tests are carried out. The first test looks at the association between CoCos <b>and</b> bank’s common <b>equity</b> risk. The second test looks at the association between leverage <b>and</b> common <b>equity</b> risk when CoCos are calculated under two different accounting regimes, first, if CoCos were treated as a <b>liability</b> <b>and</b> then as if it were treated as equity This study did not find any significant relationships between risk and CoCos or leverage, and therefore it is not able to answer the question whether the market perceives CoCos to share key characteristics with equity or liability.

40|$|Published by Berkeley Electronic PressInternational audienceWhen {{international}} {{accounting standards}} were renamed to become international financial reporting standards, this seemed to imply that accounting no longer needed to exist, but rather had to be reconsidered {{as a part of}} financial communication and advertising. Does traditional accountability no longer matter? Betrayed investors and globalized stakeholders would dissent. A difference of nature continues to exist between fair values disclosed by managers and certified by auditors, and the actual performance generated by the enterprise entity through time, space, and interaction. In a world shaped by complex organizations facing unfolding changes, hazard and limited knowledge, the quest for fundamental principles of accounting is not academic. Accounting principles constitute a primary way that the creation and allocation of business incomes is governed; that is, fairly managed and regulated in the public interest, having respect to “other people interests. ” This article adopts a dualistic posture that opposes the accounting conceptual frameworks based on fair value (market basis) and historical cost and revenue (process basis). The fundamental premises about the underlying economics of the enterprise entity are discussed, including the representation of the business and the concepts of asset <b>and</b> <b>liability.</b> References are made to the case of accounting for intangibles, and to the distinction between <b>equities</b> <b>and</b> <b>liabilities.</b> The cost <b>and</b> revenue accounting perspective is then defended in terms of accountability, but also from the informational viewpoint: historical accounting information plays a special role as a lighthouse in the dynamic and strategic setting of the Share Exchange. In particular, two refinements of the historical cost (and revenue) accounting model are suggested.
