Sincerity bars out no themes; it only demands that the dramatist's moods and visions should be intense enough to keep him absorbed; {{that he should have}} something to say so engrossing to himself that he has no need to stray here and there and gather purple plums to eke out what was intended to be an apple tart.

In Britain it is a little difficult to persuade people that the writing of plays and novels is work. To many it remains one of those inventions of a certain potentate for idle hands to do. To some persons in high life, and addicted to field sports, it is still a species of licensed buffoonery, to be regulated by a sort of circus-master with a whip in one hand and a gingerbread nut in the other. By the truly simple soul it is thus summed up: [...] "Work! Why, 'e sits writin' all day." [...] To some, both green and young, it shines as a vocation entirely glorious and exhilarating. If one may humbly believe the evidence of his own senses, it is not any of these, but a patient calling, glamorous now and then, but with fifty minutes of hard labour and yearning to every ten of satisfaction. Not a pursuit, maybe, which one would change, but then, what man with a profession flies to others that he knows not of? ...|$|R
40|$|Maxims that {{urge the}} power of images are {{cultural}} commonplaces with which we are all too familiar: 2 ̆ 2 a picture 2 ̆ 7 s worth a thousand words, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 seeing is believing, 2 ̆ 2 and so forth. The photograph, in particular, has long been perceived {{to have a special}} power of persuasion, grounded both in the lifelike quality of its depictions and in its claim to mechanical objectivity. Seeing a photograph almost functions as a substitute <b>for</b> seeing <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>thing.</b> As Susan Sontag pointed out in her seminal musings on photography, 2 ̆ 2 Photography furnishes evidence. Something we hear about, but doubt, seems proven when we 2 ̆ 7 re shown a photograph of it. 2 ̆ 2 Though Sontag meant 2 ̆ 2 evidence 2 ̆ 2 in the general sense of proof or knowledge, her claim holds equally true in the specifically legal context. Indeed, the use of photographs and other kinds of machine-produced visual images has become a routine evidentiary technique in the American courtroom. Visual evidence has {{played a central role in}} several of the highest-profile legal cases of the last few years-think, <b>for</b> example, of <b>the</b> infamous videotape of the Los Angeles police officers 2 ̆ 7 beating of Rodney King, or of the damaging photographs admitted in the civil suit against O. J. Simpson showing him clad in Bruno Magli shoes. And it is by no means only in such sensational cases that photographs and other kinds of visual evidence are deployed; rather, they are a taken-for-granted form of proof in many civil and criminal cases. Given {{the power of}} the photograph to provide strong representations [...] vivid displays that seem almost to compel belief-its frequent and growing use as evidence may not seem at all surprising. The origins of this significant form of evidence, however, have received almost no scholarly attention. A smattering of recent articles and notes have examined the evidentiary dilemmas raised by the emergence of new forms of visual evidence, such as 2 ̆ 2 day-in-the-life 2 ̆ 2 films and computer simulations. A few other pieces have analyzed the various doctrinal foundations that underlie the photograph 2 ̆ 7 s admissibility. But despite more than 125 years of photography 2 ̆ 7 s sustained legal use, the history of photographic evidence remains almost entirely untold. This Article takes a close look at the early use of photographic evidence in the American courtroom, providing a snapshot, if you will, of the legal use of photography in the second half of the nineteenth century. It reveals that photography was recognized, almost from the time of its invention, as a potentially powerful juridical tool - perhaps even a dangerously powerful tool. The meaning and epistemological status of the photograph were intensely contested, both inside and outside the courtroom. Furthermore, the history of the legal use of photography is intimately intertwined with the history of photographic technologies...|$|R

6000|$|There {{could be}} no better proof, than this quick {{intellectual}} split, of the impression made on our friend, who shone, herself, she was well aware, with but the reflected light of the admirable city. She too had had her discipline, but it had not made her striking; it had been prosaically usual, though doubtless a decent dose; and had only made her usual to match it--usual, that is, as Boston went. She had lost first her husband, and then her mother, with whom, on her husband's death, she had lived again; so that now, childless, she was but more sharply single than before. But she sat rather coldly light, having, as she called it, enough to live on--so far, that is, as she lived by bread alone: how little indeed she was regularly content with that diet appeared from the name she had made--Susan Shepherd Stringham--as {{a contributor to the}} best magazines. She wrote short stories, and she fondly believed she had her [...] "note," [...] the art of showing New England without showing it wholly in the kitchen. She had not herself been brought up in the kitchen; she knew others who had not; and to speak for them had thus become with her a literary mission. To be in truth literary had ever been her dearest thought, the thought that kept her bright little nippers perpetually in position. There were masters, models, celebrities, mainly foreign, whom she finely accounted so and in whose light she ingeniously laboured; there were others whom, however chattered about, she ranked with <b>the</b> inane, <b>for</b> she was full of discrimination; but all categories failed her--they ceased at least to signify--as soon as she found herself in presence of <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>the</b> romantic life itself. That was what she saw in Mildred--what positively made her hand a while tremble too much <b>for</b> <b>the</b> pen. She had had, it seemed to her, a revelation--such as even New England refined and grammatical couldn't give; and, all made up as she was of small neat memories and ingenuities, little industries and ambitions, mixed with something moral, personal, that was still more intensely responsive, she felt her new friend would have done her an ill turn if their friendship shouldn't develop, and yet that nothing would be left of anything else if it should. It was <b>for</b> <b>the</b> surrender of everything else that she was, however, quite prepared, and while she went about her usual Boston business with her usual Boston probity she was really all the while holding herself. She wore her [...] "handsome" [...] felt hat, so Tyrolese, yet some how, though feathered from the eagle's wing, so truly domestic, with the same straightness and security; she attached her fur boa with the same honest precautions; she preserved her balance on the ice-slopes with the same practised skill; she opened, each evening, her [...] "Transcript" [...] with the same interfusion of suspense and resignation; she attended her almost daily concert with the same expenditure of patience and the same economy of passion; she flitted {{in and out of the}} Public Library with the air of conscientiously returning or bravely carrying off in her pocket the key of knowledge itself; and finally--it was what she most did--she watched the thin trickle of a fictive [...] "love-interest" [...] through that somewhat serpentine channel, in the magazines, which she mainly managed to keep clear <b>for</b> it. But <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>thing,</b> all <b>the</b> while, was elsewhere; <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>thing</b> had gone back to New York, leaving behind it the two unsolved questions, quite distinct, of why it was real, and whether she should ever be so near it again.|$|R

It consisted of a large band, and {{although some of the}} performers used instruments made of reeds, and straws, and other hollow substances, cut into various forms and lengths, most of them had noses which served the purpose of musical instruments admirably. Indeed, the leader of the band had a prolongation of the nose so like to a flesh-coloured clarionet, that it might easily have been mistaken <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>thing,</b> and on this he discoursed the most seraphic music. Another fairy beside him had a much longer nose, which he used as a trombone with great effect. This fellow was quite a character, and played with such tremendous energy that, on more than one occasion, he brought on a fit of sneezing, which of course interrupted the music, and put the clarionet in a passion. A stout old misshapen gnome, or some such creature, with an enormous head, served for the big drum. Four fairies held him down, and a fifth belaboured his head with a drumstick. It sounded wonderfully hollow, and convinced the old man that it was destitute of brains, and not subject to headache.|$|E
6000|$|The {{practice}} of adopting {{is not confined}} to childless couples. Others may find themselves in quite as unfortunate a predicament. A man may be the father of a large and thriving family and yet be as destitute patriarchally as if he had not a child to his name. His offspring may be of the wrong sex; they may all be girls. In this untoward event the father has something more on his hands than merely a houseful of daughters to dispose of. In addition to securing sons-in-law, he must, unless he would have his ancestral line become extinct, provide himself with a son. The simplest procedure in such a case is to combine relationships in a single individual, and the most self-evident person to select for the dual capacity is the husband of the eldest daughter. This is the course pursued. Some worthy young man is secured as spouse for the senior sister; he {{is at the same time}} formally taken in as a son by the family whose cognomen he assumes, and eventually becomes the head of the house. Strange to say, this vista of gradually unfolding honors does not seem to prove inviting. Perhaps the new-comer objects to marrying the whole family, a prejudice not without parallel elsewhere. Certainly the opportunity is not appreciated. Indeed, to [...] "go out as a son-in-law," [...] as the Japanese idiom hath it, is considered demeaning to the matrimonial domestic. Like other household help he wears too patently the badge of servitude. [...] "If you have three koku of rice to your name, don't do it," [...] is the advice of the local proverb--a proverb whose warning against marrying for money is the more suggestive for being launched in a land where marrying for love is beyond the pale of respectability. To barter one's name in this mercenary manner is looked upon as derogatory to one's self-respect, although, as we have seen, to part with it for any less direct remuneration is not attended with the slightest loss of personal prestige. As practically the unfortunate had none to lose in either event, it would seem to be a case of taking away from a man that which he hath not. So contumacious a thing is custom. It is indeed lucky that popular prejudice interposes some limit to this fictitious method of acquiring children. A trifling predilection <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>thing</b> in sonships is absolutely vital, even to the continuance of the artificial variety. For if one generation ever went in exclusively for adoption, there would be no subsequent generation to adopt.|$|E
6000|$|Milly Theale had Boston friends, {{such as they}} were, and {{of recent}} making; and it was {{understood}} that her visit to them--a visit that {{was not to be}} meagre--had been undertaken, after a series of bereavements, {{in the interest of the}} particular peace that New York could not give. It was recognised, liberally enough, that there were many things--perhaps even too many--New York could give; but this was felt to make no difference in the constant fact that what you had most to do, under the discipline of life, or of death, was really to feel your situation as grave. Boston could help you to that as nothing else could, and it had extended to Milly, by every presumption, some such measure of assistance. Mrs. Stringham was never to forget--for the moment had not faded, nor the infinitely fine vibration it set up in any degree ceased--her own first sight of the striking apparition, then unheralded and unexplained: the slim, constantly pale, delicately haggard, anomalously, agreeably angular young person, of not more than two-and-twenty in spite of her marks, whose hair was some how exceptionally red even <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>thing,</b> which it innocently confessed to being, and whose clothes were remarkably black even for robes of mourning, which was the meaning they expressed. It was New York mourning, it was New York hair, it was a New York history, confused as yet, but multitudinous, of the loss of parents, brothers, sisters, almost every human appendage, all on a scale and with a sweep that had required the greater stage; it was a New York legend of affecting, of romantic isolation, and, beyond everything, it was by most accounts, in respect to the mass of money so piled on the girl's back, a set of New York possibilities. She was alone, she was stricken, she was rich, and, in particular, she was strange--a combination in itself of a nature to engage Mrs. Stringham's attention. But it was the strangeness that most determined our good lady's sympathy, convinced as she was that it was much greater than any one else--any one but the sole Susan Stringham--supposed. Susan privately settled it that Boston was not in the least seeing her, was only occupied with her seeing Boston, and that any assumed affinity between the two characters was delusive and vain. She was seeing her, and she had quite the deepest moment of her life in now obeying the instinct to conceal the vision. She couldn't explain it--no one would understand. They would say clever Boston things--Mrs. Stringham was from Burlington, Vermont, which she boldly upheld as the real heart of New England, Boston being [...] "too far south"--but they would only darken counsel.|$|E

60|$|This small {{struggle}} sprang not a little, in its way, {{from the}} same impulse that had now carried him across to Notre Dame; the impulse to let things be, to give them time to justify themselves {{or at least to}} pass. He was aware of having no errand in such a place but the desire not to be, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> hour, in certain other places; a sense of safety, of simplification, which each time he yielded to it he amused himself by thinking of as a private concession to cowardice. The great church had no altar for his worship, no direct voice for his soul; but it was none the less soothing even to sanctity; for he could feel while there what he couldn't elsewhere, that he was a plain tired man taking the holiday he had earned. He was tired, but he wasn't plain--that was the pity and the trouble of it; he was able, however, to drop his problem at the door very much {{as if it had been}} the copper piece that he deposited, on the threshold, in the receptacle of the inveterate blind beggar. He trod the long dim nave, sat in the splendid choir, paused before the cluttered chapels of the east end, and the mighty monument laid upon him its spell. He might have been a student under the charm of a museum--which was exactly what, in a foreign town, in the afternoon of life, he would have liked to be free to be.

That was the cowardice, probably--to dodge them, to beg the question, not to deal with it in the hard outer light; but his own oblivions were too brief, too vain, to hurt any one but himself, and he had a vague and fanciful kindness for certain persons whom he met, figures of mystery and anxiety, and whom, with observation for his pastime, he ranked as those who were fleeing from justice. Justice was outside, in the hard light, and injustice too; but one was as absent as the other from the air of the long aisles and the brightness of the many altars.|$|R
