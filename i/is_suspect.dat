5|$|Baldwin II was {{captured}} in 1123, and the burghers of Antioch sent envoys to Bohemond, urging {{him to come to}} his principality. Bohemond reached the age of majority at the age of 16. According to William of Tyre, he made an agreement with William II, Duke of Apulia, stipulating that the one who first died without issue was to will his principality to the other; however, the reliability of William's report <b>is</b> <b>suspect.</b> Alexander of Telese recorded that before leaving for Syria, Bohemond entrusted his Italian domains to the Holy See, but Romuald of Salerno said that he made Alexander, Count of Conversano, the overseer of those lands. Bohemond sailed from Otranto with a fleet of twenty-four ships in September 1126.|$|E
5|$|Isaac's reign was {{cut short}} by his clash with the {{powerful}} Patriarch of Constantinople, Michael Keroularios, who had been instrumental in securing Michael VI's abdication, and the powerful civil aristocracy of the capital. Keroularios and his supporters led the opposition against Isaac's stringent economizing policies, forcing him to resign on 22 November 1059, after which he withdrew to the Stoudios Monastery. The crown then passed to Constantine X Doukas (r. 1059–67), although Bryennios asserts that it was first offered to John, who refused it, despite the pressure of his wife, Anna Dalassene, to accept. According to the historian Konstantinos Varzos, however, this version <b>is</b> <b>suspect,</b> and {{may well be a}} post-fact attempt at legitimizing the eventual usurpation of the throne by John's son, Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081–1118).|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the bishops}} in England {{did not want to}} be consecrated by Stigand. Both Giso of Wells and Walter of Hereford {{travelled}} to Rome to be consecrated by the pope in 1061, rather than be consecrated by Stigand. During the brief period that he held a legitimate pallium, however, Stigand did consecrate Aethelric of Selsey and Siward of Rochester. Abbots of monasteries, however, came to Stigand for consecration throughout his time as archbishop. These included not only abbots from monastic houses inside his province, such as Æthelsige as abbot of St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury, but also Baldwin as Abbot of Bury St. Edmunds and Thurstan as Abbot of Ely. After the Norman Conquest, Stigand was accused of selling the office of abbot, but no abbot was deposed for buying the office, so the charge <b>is</b> <b>suspect.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Charvaka {{epistemology}} holds perception as {{the primary}} and proper source of knowledge, while inference is held as prone to being either right or wrong and therefore conditional or invalid. Perceptions are of two types, for Charvaka, external and internal. External perception is described as that arising from the interaction of five senses and worldly objects, while internal perception is described by this school as that of inner sense, the mind. Inference is described as deriving a new conclusion and truth from one or more observations and previous truths. To Charvakas, inference is useful but prone to error, as inferred truths can never be without doubt. Inference is good and helpful, it is the validity of inference that <b>is</b> <b>suspect</b> – sometimes in certain cases and often in others. To the Charvakas there were no reliable {{means by which the}} efficacy of inference as a means of knowledge could be established.|$|E

500|$|A {{spokesperson}} {{from the}} U.S. National Weather Service {{was quoted as}} saying that, [...] "Ava had sustained winds of about 180knots with some gusts at 200knots when she [...] was peaking". However, the official [...] "Best track" [...] data file and the seasonal summary in the Monthly Weather Review contradict that report and give maximum winds of 140knots. If Ava's winds were that high, they would one of the highest ever reported in a tropical cyclone anywhere. Like any report of winds that high it <b>is</b> <b>suspect.</b>|$|E
500|$|The first Hungarian chronicles {{were written}} in the late 11th or early [...] but their texts were {{preserved}} in manuscripts compiled in the 13th to 15th centuries. Most extant chronicles show that the earliest works contained no information {{on the history of}} the Hungarians before their conversion to Christianity in the 11th century. The only exception is the Gesta Hungarorum, which is the earliest extant Hungarian chronicle, whose principal subject is the Magyars' pagan past. However, the reliability of this work, which was written by a former royal notary now known as Anonymus, <b>is</b> <b>suspect.</b> In his monograph of medieval Hungarian historians, Carlile Aylmer Macartney describes it as [...] "the most famous, the most obscure, the most exasperating and most misleading of all the early Hungarian texts".|$|E
500|$|Works {{written by}} clergymen in the {{successor}} {{states of the}} Carolingian Empire [...] narrate events closely connected to the conquest. The Annals of Fulda which ends in 901 is the earliest among them. A letter from Archbishop Theotmar of Salzburg to Pope John IX in 900 also refers to the conquering Hungarians, but it is often regarded as a fake. Abbot Regino of Prüm who compiled his World Chronicle around 908 sums up his knowledge on the Hungarians in a sole entry under the year 889. Another valuable source is Bishop Liutprand of Cremona's Antapodosis ("Retribution") from around 960. Aventinus, a 16th-century historian provides information not known from other works, which suggests that he used now-lost sources. However, his reliability <b>is</b> <b>suspect.</b>|$|E

500|$|In Making Malcolm: The Myth and Meaning of MalcolmX, Dyson criticizes {{historians and}} biographers {{of the time}} for re-purposing the Autobiography as a transcendent {{narrative}} by a [...] "mythological" [...] MalcolmX without being critical enough of the underlying ideas. Further, {{because much of the}} available biographical studies of MalcolmX have been written by white authors, Dyson suggests their ability to [...] "interpret black experience" [...] <b>is</b> <b>suspect.</b> The Autobiography of MalcolmX, Dyson says, reflects both MalcolmX's goal of narrating his life story for public consumption and Haley's political ideologies. Dyson writes, [...] "The Autobiography of MalcolmX ... has been criticized for avoiding or distorting certain facts. Indeed, the autobiography is as much a testament to Haley's ingenuity in shaping the manuscript as it is a record of Malcolm's attempt to tell his story." ...|$|E
500|$|Talha, {{commonly}} {{known by the}} teknonym Abu Ahmad, {{was the son of}} the Caliph Ja'far al-Mutawakkil (r. 847–861) and a slave concubine, Umm Ishaq. In 861, he was present in his father's murder at Samarra by the Turkish military slaves (ghilman): the historian al-Tabari reports that he had been drinking with his father that night, and came upon the assassins while going to the toilet, but after a brief attempt to protect the caliph, he retired to his own rooms when he realized that his efforts were futile. The murder was almost certainly instigated by al-Mutawakkil's son and heir, al-Muntasir, who immediately ascended the throne; nevertheless Abu Ahmad's own role in the affair <b>is</b> <b>suspect</b> as well, given his close ties later on with the Turkish military leaders. According to Hugh N. Kennedy, [...] "it is possible, therefore, that Abu Ahmad had already had close links with the young Turks before the murder, or that they were forged on that night". This murder opened a period of internal upheaval known as the [...] "Anarchy at Samarra", where the Turkish military chiefs vied with other powerful groups and with each other over control of the government and its financial resources.|$|E
2500|$|Traditional {{religions}} are often animist.

2500|$|The {{foundational}} {{philosophy of}} intuitionism or constructivism, as exemplified {{in the extreme}} by Brouwer and more coherently by Stephen Kleene, requires proofs to be [...] "constructive" [...] in nature {{the existence of an}} object must be demonstrated rather than inferred from a demonstration of the impossibility of its non-existence.
