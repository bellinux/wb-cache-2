In February 2016 the Palmetto was converted into a private event space and pop-up restaurant, and The Parish resumed serving lunch from 11:30 am to 3:00 pm on Fridays and Saturdays.

5|$|The {{restaurant}} replaced Leo's Non-Smoking Coffee Shop, {{which was}} owned by Peter and Jane Chan for thirty years. When Leo's closed in February 2014, rumors had already circulated about restaurateur and developer Dayna McErlean's {{plans to open a}} more upscale diner. The Dime Store's concept was created by McErlean and Jeremy Larter, and was inspired by the soda shops they both experienced growing up on the East Coast. Prior to the restaurant's opening, plans were to serve breakfast and lunch during mid-week hours, with the potential to later add <b>happy</b> <b>hour</b> and family-friendly dinner options, as well as outdoor seating.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the first}} people Scantlin met upon {{arriving}} in California was Doug Ardito, an intern at Interscope Records. When Scantlin found out about Ardito's bass playing, they decided to work together. They were still in need of a guitarist and drummer. Fred Durst decided to contact a guitarist he knew from his hometown of Jacksonville, Florida, Paul Phillips, who had formerly played in a local band there called <b>Happy</b> <b>Hour.</b> After getting the call from Durst, Paul decided to try out for Puddle of Mudd and was accepted, choosing to leave college in order to join. The band held auditions for a new drummer and selected Greg Upchurch, who was an ex-member of Eleven and had also toured with Chris Cornell.|$|E
25|$|Harley Quinn - Completely {{loyal to}} the Joker in her first appearances, even though he mistreats her. She starts to develop {{feelings}} for the Green Goblin, which is briefly hinted at when she accepts Goblin's offer {{to go out on}} a date for coffee at the end of After Hours. At the end of <b>Happy</b> <b>Hour</b> she had been living with Goblin, but in Zero Hour it was shown that she still pined for the then presumed-dead Joker, much to Goblin's dismay. At the conclusion of Zero Hour she chooses to give up on the Joker and joins the Goblin in the parallel reality that Darkseid intended to house a 'rebooted' version of the world of the combined universe which Stan's Place inhabited. Both she and the Goblin are apparently replaced by their 'reboot' counterparts in the main reality at the end of Zero Hour. The reboot versions appear to have no romantic feelings towards one another. The fate of the original versions, presumably still in the 'rebooted' universe are currently unknown.|$|E
25|$|Darkseid - The primary {{antagonist}} working {{behind the}} scenes of Zero Hour, he is first seen at the end of <b>Happy</b> <b>Hour</b> confronting the Joker, who is at that point presumed dead by everyone on the combined Marvel/DC reality in which the videos normally take place. In episode five part one of Zero Hour the scene featuring Darkseid's first appearance in the series was expanded, as part of the backstory to the events of the Zero Hour videos. He is at first shown to be unaware of his fictional nature, and is told of it by the Joker. Lex Luthor originally planned to trick the heroes into travelling to Apokolips to battle Darkseid as part of a plan to seize control of Stan's Place, the dimensional nexus which links seemingly all comic book universes within the videos, but scrapped the plan because Darkseid was unaware of his status as a fictional character and had no idea how Darkseid would react if told the truth. Darkseid plans to use a device to 'reboot' the universe the videos take place in, intending to become the sole ruler of the 'new' reality and nearly succeeds, until Deadpool reveals that he is still in a world of fiction, as he is personally aware {{of the nature of the}} YouTube videos— and apparently aware of RandomGuy as well, as Darkseid is forcefed all of Deadpool's knowledge due to his ability to breach the fourth wall. As a result, Darkseid appears to suffer a mental breakdown and collapses. His current status within the universe of the videos after the end of Zero Hour is unknown.|$|E
