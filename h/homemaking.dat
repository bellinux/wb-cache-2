5|$|Lady's Realm printed an {{assortment}} of Court and society news alongside articles on more daily tasks such as food, <b>homemaking,</b> and methods for female readers to earn money. It covered the London Season, displaying photographs of significant society figures and débutantes. It claimed to feature over 500 illustrations in each volume. Theatre was another regular topic of the magazine's, as was fiction, poetry, and reports on fashion. The Lady's Realms fashion editor Marian Pritchard regularly wrote articles on emerging fashions in London and Paris, and recommended locations where readers could buy them. While still featuring fashion and beauty, it also encouraged careers for women in music, art, business, and millinery. The magazine maintained this blend of topics relatively consistently, though it gradually made {{minor changes to the}} proportion it focused on different topics, for instance later focusing less on the nobility and more on the lives of clergymen and governors general.|$|E

25|$|In 1961, Lichtenstein {{began his}} first pop {{paintings}} using cartoon images and techniques {{derived from the}} appearance of commercial printing. This phase would continue to 1965, and included the use of advertising imagery suggesting consumerism and <b>homemaking.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1884 the United States Indian Industrial Training School {{was opened}} in Lawrence. Boys were taught the trades of tailor making, blacksmithing, farming and others while girls were taught cooking and <b>homemaking.</b> In 1887 {{the name was}} changed to the Haskell Institute, after Dudley Haskell, a {{legislator}} responsible for the school being in Lawrence. In 1993 the name was changed again to Haskell Indian Nations University.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, Betty Friedan's exposé The Feminine Mystique {{became the}} {{voice for the}} discontent and {{disorientation}} women felt in being shunted into <b>homemaking</b> positions after their college graduations. In the book, Friedan explored {{the roots of the}} change in women's roles from essential workforce during World War II to homebound housewife and mother after the war, and assessed the forces that drove this change in perception of women's roles.|$|E
25|$|Some Native Americans {{are thought}} to have learned {{quilting}} through observation of white settlers; others learned it from missionaries who taught quilting to Native American women along with other <b>homemaking</b> skills. Native American women quickly developed their own unique style, the Lone Star design (also called the Star of Bethlehem), a variation on Morning Star designs that had been featured on Native American clothing and other items for centuries. These quilts often featured floral appliqué framing the star design. Pictorial quilts, created with appliqué, were also common.|$|E
25|$|Following Entertaining success, Stewart {{released}} {{many more}} books under the Clarkson Potter publishing imprint, including Martha Stewart's Quick Cook (1983), Martha Stewart's Hors D'oeuvres (1984), Martha Stewart's Pies & Tarts (1985), Weddings (1987), The Wedding Planner (1988), Martha Stewart's Quick Cook Menus (1988), and Martha Stewart's Christmas (1989), among others. During this time, she also authored dozens of newspaper columns, magazine articles and other pieces on <b>homemaking,</b> and made numerous television appearances on {{programs such as}} The Oprah Winfrey Show and Larry King Live. Andrew and Martha Stewart separated in 1987 and divorced in 1990.|$|E
25|$|Lobbying {{began in}} 1929 for the {{construction}} of the final section, the building {{on the south side of}} the lot connecting the Bedford Avenue building with the auditorium near Flatbush Avenue. Money was not appropriated for this until 1937 however, and it was finally built in 1939–40. Under the supervision of the school system’s then chief architect, Eric Kebbon, the five-story building was an even more simplified version of Snyder’s earlier work. It contained many classrooms, art and <b>homemaking</b> rooms, a girls’ gym and a large library, and could accommodate 1,566 additional pupils. The new section opened in September 1940. To construct this building, the original frame school house had to be moved and its several wings demolished. Work on the old structure was begun by the Works Progress Administration, but was halted due to the outbreak of World War II. After the war, the relocation and restoration of the old building was completed and it was used for administrative offices. In 1987, in celebration of the school’s bicentennial, limited archaeological excavations were conducted under the auspices of Brooklyn College. The archaeologists discovered that intact deposits from the 18th and 19th centuries associated with the development of the school are still in place.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} written {{reference to}} the Slavic hogweed soup {{can be found in}} [...] (Domestic Order), a 16th-century Russian compendium of moral rules and <b>homemaking</b> advice. It recommends growing the plant [...] "by the fence, around the whole garden, where the nettle grows", to cook a soup of it in springtime and reminds the reader to, [...] "for the Lord's sake, share it with those in need". Simon Syrenius (...) , a 17th-century Polish botanist, described [...] "our Polish hogweed" [...] as a vegetable that was well known throughout Poland, Rus', Lithuania and Samogitia (that is, most of the northern part of Eastern Europe), typically used for cooking a [...] "tasty and graceful soup" [...] with capon stock, eggs, sour cream and millet. More interested in the plant's medicinal properties than its culinary use, he also recommended pickled hogweed juice as a cure for fever or hangover.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of season one, Monica is 25 years old. Rita Loiacono of SheKnows Media believes that Monica is the show's most fully realized character {{from the very beginning}} of the series because her [...] "quirks were developed to a tee." [...] Like several strong female sitcom characters who were popular throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Monica possesses a natural maternal instinct, constantly [...] "vocalising a desire for motherhood." [...] As the group's [...] "unofficial den mother," [...] Monica occupies the role of their mother hen, and is thus often perceived as the most level-headed member of the sextet, with Ken Parish Perkins of the Chicago Tribune identifying Monica as the show's most grounded character. Jill O'Rourke of Crushable described her as [...] "the glue that held the group together." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly believes that Monica serves as [...] "the solid center in a circle of wacky pals" [...] due to her [...] "sunny" [...] personality, combined with the fact that she maintains a secure job while appearing to possess the most common sense. Furthermore, Tucker identified Monica as the show's [...] "straight woman." [...] Writing for The New York Times, John J. O'Connor believes that Monica exhibits [...] "the strongest ties to reality" [...] as the sitcom's most realistically portrayed character. Bustle's James Tison agreed that Monica is the show's most relatable character. Referring to Monica as one-half of the series' [...] "head friends," [...] the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette's Robert Bianco described the character as sensible, explaining that both her and brother Ross represent [...] "the relatively stable centers around which the other friends rotate." [...] Describing her as [...] "ultra-competent," [...] Natural Living Todays Emily Nussbaum likened Monica to the fairy tale character Snow White, on whose <b>homemaking</b> skills the five other main characters heavily rely, similar to the relationship between Snow White and the seven dwarfs. Although Monica began Friends as the show's straight person, the writers eventually made her funnier by incorporating aspects of Cox's own personality into the character, in addition to writing wittier material for her.|$|E

2500|$|Using new {{technology}} to enhance the scope and impact of its programming has been a focus of Cooperative Extension work nationwide. [...] In Alabama, Extension and its sister organization, the Experiment Station, began using emerging radio technology as early as 1922 when funds were secured to purchase a small radio station known as WMAV. [...] By 1925, WAPI, “the Voice of Alabama,” a far more powerful station, was broadcasting a 1,000-watt signal from {{the third floor of}} Comer Hall on the API (now Auburn University) campus. [...] In addition to news and weather, the station broadcast educational programs related to agriculture and <b>homemaking.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Wald never married. She {{maintained}} {{her closest}} relationships and attachments with women. Correspondence reveals that Wald felt intimate affection {{for at least}} two of her companions, <b>homemaking</b> author Mabel Hyde Kittredge and lawyer Helen Arthur. Ultimately, however, Wald was more engaged in her work with Henry Street than in any intimate relationship. In regard to Wald's relationships, author Clare Coss writes that Wald [...] "remained in the end forever elusive. She preferred personal independence, which allowed her to move quickly, travel freely and act boldly." [...] Wald's personal life and focus on independence was clear in her devotion to the Settlement and improving public health.|$|E
2500|$|Although Dinah's Place {{featured}} famous guest stars, Shore often grilled lesser-known lifestyle {{experts on}} nutrition, exercise, or <b>homemaking.</b> Despite {{being one of}} the more popular programs in NBC's morning lineup, this show left the air in 1974 after NBC sent a telegram to Dinah congratulating her on her Emmy win—at the same time informing her the show was being cancelled, because it broke up a [...] "game show programming block". Thus ended the network's 35-year association with Shore. She returned that fall with Dinah!, a syndicated 90-minute daily talk show (also seen in a 60-minute version on some stations) that put the focus on top guest stars and entertainment. This show was seen as competition for Mike Douglas and Merv Griffin, whose shows had been on the air for 10 years when Dinah! debuted. Frequent guests included entertainment figures (Lucille Ball, Bob Hope, and James Stewart), as well as regular contributors including lifestyle guru Dr. Wayne Dyer.|$|E
2500|$|Farrakhan {{received}} {{sexual discrimination}} complaints filed with a New York state agency when he banned women from attending a speech {{he gave in}} a city-owned theater in 1993. The next year he gave a speech only women could attend. In his speech for women, as The New York Times reported, [...] "Mr. Farrakhan urged the women to embrace his formula for a successful family. He encouraged them to put husbands and children ahead of their careers, shun tight, short skirts, stay off welfare and reject abortion. He also {{stressed the importance of}} cooking and cleaning and urged women not to abandon <b>homemaking</b> for careers. 'You’re just not going to be happy unless there is happiness in the home,' Mr. Farrakhan said at the Mason Cathedral Church of God in Christ in the Dorchester section, not far from the Roxbury neighborhood where he was raised by a single mother. 'Your professional lives can’t satisfy your soul like a good, loving man.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Wendy Darling– Wendy is {{the eldest}} child, their only daughter, and {{the protagonist of}} the novel. She loves the idea of <b>homemaking</b> and {{storytelling}} and {{wants to become a}} mother; her dreams consist of adventures in a little woodland house with her pet wolf. She bears a bit of (mutual) animosity toward Tiger Lily because of their similar affections toward Peter. She does not seem to {{feel the same way about}} Tinker Bell, but the fairy is constantly bad-mouthing her and even tries to have her killed. At the end of the novel, she has grown up and is married with a daughter (Jane) and a granddaughter (Margaret). She is portrayed variously with blonde, brown, or black hair in different stories. While it is not clear whether or not she is in love with Peter, one can assume that she does have some feelings toward him. Wendy is often referred to as the [...] "mother" [...] of the Lost Boys and, while Peter also considers her to be his [...] "mother", he takes on the [...] "father" [...] role, hinting that they play a married couple in their games.|$|E
