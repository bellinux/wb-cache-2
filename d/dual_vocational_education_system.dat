We analyze a novel program providing mentoring to low-achieving school leavers as a bridge between different stages and different institutional systems in secondary and post-secondary education. Using high-quality survey and administrative data and propensity score matching, we find some positive effects on the probability of transiting into the <b>dual</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>education</b> <b>system</b> in the intermediate run. Higher program intensity leads to larger treatment effects. Contrary to the goals of the program, however, there is only weak evidence that it accelerates transitions into vocational training immediately after leaving school...|$|E

The company-based element of dual education and training is mainly financed by companies that also have the sole decision-making authority regarding the allocation of training positions they offer. In addition, Germany has a school-based occupational system, with purely school-based training courses subject to legal provisions other than those within <b>dual</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>education</b> and training.

40|$|In {{order to}} find a proper method of {{financing}} the <b>vocational</b> <b>education</b> <b>system</b> {{it is necessary to}} build a target model of <b>vocational</b> <b>education.</b> When building such a model, there should be known evolutionary transformations in the <b>vocational</b> <b>education</b> <b>system.</b> In his historical an alysis of the <b>vocational</b> <b>education</b> <b>system,</b> the author is trying to stress these moments, which had and continue to have a decisive importance for both the present and the planned <b>system</b> of <b>vocational</b> <b>education,</b> and he presents development trends in the sphere of <b>vocational</b> <b>education</b> as a stage in creating a target model. The solutions applied in Poland hither to envisage two ways of preparing qualified manpower. One of them is the <b>vocational</b> <b>education</b> <b>system</b> subordinated to local educational authorities and the other - vocational training centers attached to industrial plants. The experience of many countries and the scientific - technical progress taking place all the time speak in favour of the latter solution as a leading one. However, acceptance of such a solution has multiple consequences. This concerns also the structure and the functioning of the financing system. In this area, the most important problems are those concerning choice of forms and sources of financing.

40|$|<b>Vocational</b> <b>education</b> in Korea {{has been}} {{suffered}} from various problems. Curricula do not adequately mirror {{the needs of}} the fields. Efforts between vocational high shools and junior vocational colleges are not sufficient enough to establish the vertical linkage through which vocational curricula are closely connected according to the education level. Classroom instructions are managed mainly by textbooks and teachers and do not use new media. Various work-based learning strategies aimed at providing hands-on experience for students are not developed and utilized. Another problem is the mismatch between school curricula and the vocational qualification system. Because of insufficient linkage between two systems, the achievements of students in school are not fully recognized within the latter. On the other hand, <b>vocational</b> <b>education</b> <b>system</b> is facing with abundant tasks to be tackled with in meeting the needs from life-long learning society.

30|$|Model 4 uncovers that an {{increase}} of the proportion of apprentices by one standard deviation (= 6.2 % points; see Table  2) is expected to significantly reduce the NEET rate of young males by approximately 1.0 % points, whereas no effect is expected for young females (see Table  2; Fig.  3 a). Further, the estimation results from model 5 provide some evidence that non-Austrian citizens may significantly profit from <b>dual</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>education</b> supply, while {{this is not the}} case for Austrians (see Table  2; Fig.  3 c). However, the respective cross-level interaction effect, indicating slope differences between the citizenship groups, fails the preassigned 10 % significance level (see Table  2). The same holds true for a likelihood-ratio test between models with and without cross-level interaction term. Further, since being employed is (1) a necessary condition for participating in <b>dual</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>education</b> and (2) highly selective with regard to migration status (Bacher 2010), dual apprenticeship policy appears to be a highly challenging task to effectively reduce the NEET probability of young non-Austrian citizens. In any case, hypothesis H 1 b—assuming that a higher provision of dual apprenticeships reduces the NEET rate of young migrants to a lesser extent than those of young Austrians has to be rejected and we cannot confirm previous findings (see Sect.  3.1). As expected, no significant effects can be identified for the older age group (20 – 24  years).|$|R
