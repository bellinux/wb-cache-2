500|$|Many Republicans were touting Huntsman as a {{possible}} rising star in the party {{and that he has}} a role in reshaping the party. Utah businessman Republican activist Tim Bridgewater said [...] "Huntsman has a very bright future." [...] Huntsman said that [...] "I {{think there will be a}} lot of personalities emerging between now and 2012. I think the party needs to be smart enough to maintain an open mind. Obama was nowhere on the radar screen four years ago." [...] In June 2009, Huntsman top advisor John Weaver, who was also an advisor for McCain, claimed [...] "I firmly believe that Huntsman and people like him are the prescription for what ails us. But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that our party maybe won't order that prescription in 2012." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his other}} works he experimented {{more with less}} {{traditional}} approaches to reality, so that [...] "the most frightful, the most unusual things are told with the deadpan expression". A commonly cited example is the physical and spiritual ascending into heaven of a character while she is hanging the laundry out to dry in One Hundred Years of Solitude. The style of these works fits in the [...] "marvellous realm" [...] described by the Cuban writer Alejo Carpentier and was labeled as magical realism. Literary critic Michael Bell proposes an alternative understanding for García Márquez's style, as the category magic realism is criticized for being dichotomizing and exoticizing, [...] "what is really at stake is a psychological suppleness which is able to inhabit unsentimentally the daytime world while remaining open to the promptings of those domains which modern culture has, by its own inner logic, necessarily marginalised or repressed." [...] García Márquez and his friend Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza discuss his work in a similar way,"The way you treat reality in your books ... has been called magical realism. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> your European readers are usually aware of the magic of your stories but fail to see the reality behind it ..." [...] "This is surely because their rationalism prevents them seeing that reality isn't limited {{to the price of}} tomatoes and eggs." ...|$|E
500|$|Langford {{later said}} that Neighbours {{is doing a}} [...] "fairly decent job" [...] with Chris's coming out story. He wished that viewers got {{to see more of}} Chris's {{thoughts}} and feelings and less of how his situation affected the people around him. Langford added [...] "I do like that Chris isn't a perfect kid. Many shows tend to make gay teens near saints. Instead, he's a fairly average kid who makes mistakes and messes up, like starting a fight at a basketball game. In July 2011, Langford revealed that he had seen some comments from people thinking that Lucas and Chris should be paired up. He opined {{that there is not a}} hint of romance between the two and wondered why people assumed that if a gay character shares a scene with another guy, they must get together. Langford revealed that he liked Chris and Lucas's mentor and mentee relationship as it is. The writer also commented on the introduction of Chris's father and said that he was [...] "delighted" [...] that Chris was finally getting his own drama, that was [...] "pretty realistic." [...] He added [...] "It's nice to see the father/son dynamic play out. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that a lot of Chris's dad's issues stem from the fact that his son is gay and I hope the show will delve into those unresoved issues." ...|$|E

5000|$|The first {{performance}} of Tabula Rasa in Tallinn 1977 {{was considered to}} be a major success. The composer Erkki-Sven Tüür, said about the performance: [...] "I was carried beyond. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that eternity was touching me through this music...nobody wanted to start clapping." ...|$|R
2500|$|When I {{hear what}} we call music, {{it seems to me}} that someone is talking. And talking about his feelings, or about his ideas of relationships. But when I hear traffic, the sound of traffic—here on Sixth Avenue, for instance—I don't have the feeling that anyone is talking. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that sound is acting. And I love the {{activity}} of sound [...] I don't need sound to talk to me.|$|E

6000|$|... "I cannot trust a woman," [...] he {{answered}} coldly. [...] "All the time <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of insecurity. I {{fear that it}} must sound ungallant if I tell you what is the sober truth--that your sex for the present has lost all charm for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{but that}} is impossible!" [...] she replied. [...] "I cannot keep the bitter {{thoughts}} from my own heart.

6000|$|... "That is true," [...] the Howadji reflected. [...] "But I am full of my subject, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that I {{am getting}} more out, even if I can't get more in, by talking fast. The rent {{question}} itself," [...] he hurried on, [...] "has been satisfactorily solved of {{late in the}} new invention of co-operative housing which {{you may have heard}} of." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I want to {{know all}} about your candidate, Mr. Brooks," [...] she declared. [...] "You can't imagine how pleased <b>I</b> am to <b>have</b> you here. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> ever since <b>I</b> came of being shut up in a hostile camp. I am a Radical, you know, and these good people, even my mother, are rabid Conservatives." ...|$|R
60|$|To {{my great}} surprise, the duke saluted me quite civilly. But <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of facing a treacherous bull which would gore {{me as soon}} as ever my back was turned. He was always putting me in mind of a bull, with his short neck and heavy, hunched shoulders,--and with the ugly tinge of red in the whites of his eyes.|$|R
5000|$|In 1932, she {{was arrested}} and jailed for {{speaking}} against the Emergency Measures. By the late 1930s she felt conscious {{of the need to}} give way to indigenous Indian feminists: I longed to be in <b>the</b> struggle, but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that direct participation by me was no longer required, or even desired by the leaders of India womanhood who were now coming to the front.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{believe that}} {{somehow or other}} the end is coming," [...] she said. [...] "Francis, forgive me if I tell you this--or rather let me be forgiven--but I know of one crime my father has committed, {{and it makes me}} fear that there may be others. And <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling,</b> somehow, that the end is close at hand and that he feels it, just as we might feel a thunder-storm in the air." ...|$|E
6000|$|After a few days' {{experience}} in a neighboring town I decided that whatever else I might be fitted for in this world, I was not intended for a book agent. Surrendering my prospectus to the firm, I took my way down to Madison, {{the capital of the}} state, a city which seemed at this time very remote, and very important in my world. Only when travelling did <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of living up to the expectations of Alice and Burton who put into their letters to me, an envy which was very sweet. To them I was a bold adventurer! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It may be that," [...] she {{admitted}} doubtfully. [...] "On the other hand, don't let's run any risk. I should hate {{to find an}} affinity, and {{all that sort of}} thing, after marriage--divorce in these days is such shocking bad form. Besides, honestly, Nigel, I don't feel frivolous enough to think about marriage just now. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that even while the clock is ticking we are moving on to terrible things. I can't tell you quite what it is. I carried my life in my hands during those last few days abroad. I dare say this is the reaction." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{other options}} as well. Professionally, it's an {{experience}} that can only do me good. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> chance to sign for three years with AG2R-La Mondiale but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that <b>I</b> wasn't going to develop enough. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> always raced in France and, in my heart, some experience abroad has excited me for some time. I therefore {{decided to take the}} step and Patrick Lefévère's advances completely persuaded me.|$|R
50|$|During the hearing, {{when asked}} what he thought James (Whitey) did for a living, William Bulger said: <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> {{that he was in}} the {{business}} of gaming and... whatever. It was vague to me but I didn't think, for a long while he had some jobs but ultimately it was clear that he was not being, you know, he wasn't doing what I'd like him to do.|$|R
5000|$|The {{show was}} {{scheduled}} to debut during October 2000 at 8:00 p.m. on Fridays, but this never eventuated, with reality show Police Chase and Freakylinks airing in its place. It eventually aired on Fox from July 12 to September 6, 2001 as a summer filler. Billy Brown reflected [...] "There was a {{changing of the guard}} at Fox between the time we filmed the pilot and the time the network was ready to order the series. The new regime wasn't convinced an anthology would work, yet everyone agreed that the pilot was good. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>the</b> network didn't think the show was hip enough".|$|R
6000|$|Meanwhile here we are--and when do {{you mean}} to come to see us, pray? Mind, I hold by the skirts of the vision for next winter. Why, surely you won't talk of 'disturbances' and 'revolutions,' and the like disloyal reasons which send our brave countrymen flying on all sides, as if every {{separate}} individual expected to be bombarded per se. Now, mind you come; dear dear Mr. Kenyon, how delighted past expression we should be to see you! Ah, do you fancy that I have no regret for our delightful gossips? If <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> I told you of for Balzac and George Sand, what must I have for you? Now come, and let us see you! And still sooner, if you please, write to us--and write of yourself and in detail--and tell us particularly, first if the winter has left no sign of a cough with you, and next, what you mean by something which suggests to my fancy that you have a book in the course of printing. Is that true? Tell me all about it--all! Who can be interested, pray, if I am not? For your and Mr. Chorley's and Mr. Forster's kind dealings with Robert's poems I thank you gratefully; and as a third volume can bring up the rear quickly in the case of success, I make no wailing for my 'Luria,' however dear it may be.[175] ...|$|E
60|$|The editor {{passed away}} too, not long after, {{and the thing}} that he had {{inspired}} altogether ceased to be. He was a man of a certain sardonic power, and used it rather fiercely and freely, with a joy probably more apparent than real in the pain it gave. In my last knowledge of him he was much milder than when I first knew him, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that he too came to own before he died that man cannot live by snapping-turtle alone. He was kind to some neglected talents, and befriended them with a vigor and a zeal which he would have been the last to let you call generous. The chief of these was Walt Whitman, who, when the Saturday Press took it up, had as hopeless a cause with the critics {{on either side of the}} ocean as any man could have. It was not till long afterwards that his English admirers began to discover him, and to make his countrymen some noisy reproaches for ignoring him; they were wholly in the dark concerning him when the Saturday Press, which first stood his friend, and the young men whom the Press gathered about it, made him their cult. No doubt he was more valued because he was so offensive in some ways than he would have been if he had been in no way offensive, but it remains a fact that they celebrated him quite as much as was good for them. He was often at Pfaff's with them, and the night of my visit he was the chief fact of my experience. I did not know he was there till I was on my way out, for he did not sit at the table under the pavement, but at the head of one farther into the room. There, as I passed, some friendly fellow stopped me and named me to him, and I remember how he leaned back in his chair, and reached out his great hand to me, as if he were going to give it me for good and all. He had a fine head, with a cloud of Jovian hair upon it, and a branching beard and mustache, and gentle eyes that looked most kindly into mine, and seemed to wish the liking which I instantly gave him, though we hardly passed a word, and our acquaintance was summed up in that glance and the grasp of his mighty fist upon my hand. I doubt if he had any notion who or what I was beyond the fact that I was a young poet of some sort, but he may possibly have remembered seeing my name printed after some very Heinesque verses in the Press. I did not meet him again for twenty years, and then I had only a moment with him when he was reading the proofs of his poems in Boston. Some years later I saw him for the last time, one day after his lecture on Lincoln, in that city, when he came down from the platform to speak with some handshaking friends who gathered about him. Then and always he gave me the sense of a sweet and true soul, and I felt in him a spiritual dignity which I will not try to reconcile with his printing in the forefront of his book a passage from a private letter of Emerson's, though I believe he would not have seen such a thing as most other men would, or thought ill of it in another. The spiritual purity which I felt in him no less than the dignity is something that I will no more try to reconcile with what denies it in his page; but such things we may well leave to the adjustment of finer balances than we have at hand. I will make sure only of the greatest benignity in the presence of the man. The apostle of the rough, the uncouth, was the gentlest person; his barbaric yawp, translated into the terms of social encounter, was an address of singular quiet, delivered in a voice of winning and endearing friendliness.|$|E
