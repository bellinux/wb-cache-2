Peace feelers {{were sent to the}} Ottomans, but their demand for the full concession of Crete as a condition for peace was unacceptable to the Republic. With {{the end of the war}} between France and Spain however, the Venetians became encouraged, hoping to receive increased assistance in money and men, especially from the French, whose traditionally good relations with the Porte had soured of late.|$|E
5|$|The 19thcentury saw {{increasing}} {{public interest}} in France's heritage and efforts were undertaken to preserve historic buildings. In 1830 the newly crowned Louis PhilippeI created the role of Inspector-General of Historic Monuments. Prosper Mérimée, better known as a writer, assumed the position in 1834 and helped halt the decay that <b>had</b> <b>set</b> <b>in</b> at Château de Chinon and instigated repairs to the structure. Since 1840, the castle has been recognised as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture.|$|E

In 1640 the General Assembly ordered Gilbert Ross, the minister of St Giles kirk, to remove the rood screen which still partitioned the choir and presbytery from the nave. Ross was assisted in this by the Lairds of Innes and Brodie who chopped it up for firewood. It is believed that the destruction of the great west window was caused by Oliver Cromwell's soldiers sometime between 1650 and 1660.|$|E

Although supporters have praised his commitment to civil service reform and defense of civil rights, Hayes is generally listed among the high-end of the bottom half in historians' rankings of U.S. presidents.|$|E

5|$|After {{almost a}} year of {{investigations}} against Uli Hoeneß, Bayern's former player, former long-time general manager, and president at the time, {{he was convicted of}} tax evasion on 13 March 2014. Hoeneß resigned as president the next day, and Karl Hopfner was elected president on 2 May. Just days after Hoeneß conviction, on 25 March, Bayern won their 24th Bundesliga title by beating Hertha BSC 3–1 at the Olympiastadion in Berlin. With seven matches remaining in the season, it was the earliest the championship had been won in Bundesliga history, breaking the record Bayern <b>had</b> <b>set</b> <b>in</b> the previous season. At {{the end of the season}} Bayern beat Borussia Dortmund 2–0 in the 2014 DFB-Pokal Final to give the club the tenth league and cup double in its history. In 2014–15, Bayern defended their league title, and, the following season, won an 11th double, including a record fourth consecutive Bundesliga title. At the end of the 2015–16 season, Guardiola left Bayern to take over as manager of Manchester City and was replaced by Carlo Ancelotti.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{their opponents}} {{were able to}} lift and the final saw Steve Lundquist of the United States set a new world record of 1m 1.65s; Evans took bronze, 0.98s behind silver medallist Davis. Evans was unable to {{maintain}} the pace that he <b>had</b> <b>set</b> <b>in</b> the heats, clocking a time 0.10s slower. In the 200m, Evans came second in his heat but was not fast {{enough to make the}} final, swimming 1.47s slower than the slowest qualifier to finish 17th. The final event for Evans was the 4×100m medley relay. Evans was joined by Kerry, while Glenn Buchanan and Mark Stockwell swum the butterfly and freestyle respectively. The Americans were overwhelming favourites, boasting the gold medallists in three of the respective individual events. The hosts easily won the gold by almost four seconds; Evans and the Australians were third, relegated from the silver medal by just 0.02s by the Canadian team, having been in the bronze medal position at every change. Evans recorded the second-fastest breaststroke split, slower than Lundquist, but quicker than the rest, including Davis.|$|E

5|$|The English {{played the}} first half with the wind behind them and their nine-man scrum {{dominated}} the smaller Welsh pack. At half time Wales were 7–0 down following tries from Frederick Lohden and Howard Marshall and a conversion from England captain Andrew Stoddart. The second half started poorly for Wales when Marshall scored a second try following excellent English forward pressure. The game turned not long after: the English forwards could not maintain the pace they <b>had</b> <b>set</b> <b>in</b> {{the first half}} of the game, and began to slow. Then Welsh forward Charles Nicholl broke through a line-out with the ball, transferred it to Hannan, who passed to Gould at the half way line. Gould evaded both Alderson and Lockwood before outpacing Edwin Field to score beneath the posts. Bancroft converted. A near identical move resulted in Conway Rees then releasing Cardiff wing Norman Biggs who scored with a run from the half-way line, though this time the conversion missed.|$|E
5|$|The {{prolonged}} conflict exhausted {{the economy}} of the Republic, which relied on the lucrative trade with the Ottoman Empire. By the 1660s, despite increased aid from other Christian nations, war-weariness <b>had</b> <b>set</b> <b>in.</b> The Ottomans on the other hand, having managed to sustain their forces on Crete and reinvigorated under the capable leadership of the Köprülü family, sent a final great expedition in 1666 under the direct supervision of the Grand Vizier. This began the final and bloodiest stage of the Siege of Candia, which lasted for more than two years. It ended with the negotiated surrender of the fortress, sealing the fate of the island and ending the war in an Ottoman victory. In the final peace treaty, Venice retained a few isolated island fortresses off Crete, and made some territorial gains in Dalmatia. The Venetian desire for a revanche would lead, barely 15 years later, to a renewed war, from which Venice would emerge victorious. Crete however was lost to the Serenissima. It would remain under Ottoman control until 1897, when it became an autonomous state; it was finally united with Greece in 1913.|$|E
5|$|Under the Kingdom, Sicily's {{products}} went to {{many different}} lands. Among these were Genoa, Pisa, the Byzantine Empire, and Egypt. Over {{the course of}} the 12th century, Sicily became an important source of raw materials for north Italian cities such as Genoa. As the centuries went on, however, this economic relationship became less advantageous to Sicily, and some modern scholars see the relationship as frankly exploitative. Furthermore, many scholars believe that Sicily went into decline in the late Middle Ages, though they are not agreed on when this decline occurred. Clifford Backman argues that {{it is a mistake to}} see the economic history of Sicily in terms of victimization, and contends that the decline really began in the second part of the reign of Frederick III, in contrast to earlier scholars who believed that Sicilian decline <b>had</b> <b>set</b> <b>in</b> earlier. Where earlier scholars saw late medieval Sicily in continuous decline, Stephen Epstein argued that Sicilian society experienced something of a revival in the 15th century.|$|E
