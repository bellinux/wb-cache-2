Although the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (now known as the World Bank) were created, the International Trade Organisation (ITO), the forerunner of the WTO, was only a proposition at this point. It was not until 1947 that negotiations were concluded and the ITO came into being. In the Havana Charter, the text of the ITO, Article 7 pertained specifically to <b>fair</b> <b>labour</b> <b>standards,</b> requiring that members of the organisation must, amongst other things, [...] "take fully into account the rights of workers under inter-governmental declarations, conventions and agreements" [...] and recognise [...] "that all countries have a common interest in the achievement and maintenance of <b>fair</b> <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> related to productivity, and thus in the improvement of wages and working conditions as productivity may permit". In the interim period before the ratification of the charter, states decided to follow an interim agreement, known as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which was to be later incorporated into the ITO's legal framework. This temporary arrangement did not include any references to labour rights. The requisite number of states failed to ratify the ITO and so it failed and GATT became the basis for the current world trade system.|$|R

40|$|Summary Points The {{last few}} decades have seen {{substantial}} increases in the migration of migrant workers, raising concerns about the health implications of these movements. In destination countries, migrant workers often fill undesirable, low-skill positions characterized by flexibility, insecurity, precarious employment, and long working hours with low pay. Undocumented or “illegal” migrants are especially vulnerable to exploitation since they fear job loss, incarceration, and deportation. Urgent health issues to be addressed among migrant workers include occupational safety, injury prevention, work-related diseases, barriers to accessing health services, and the associated health risks for their families and communities, in addition to discrimination and exploitation. Governments, unions, and international organizations should collaborate to implement <b>fair</b> <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> for both legal and illegal labourers that are on par with citizen workers, standardise labour migration policies, and provide legal support for undocumented labourers to help eradicate human trafficking {{and other forms of}} extreme labour exploitation...|$|R

This report summarizes the research I have conducted since 1970 on the likely effects of these proposed policy changes and my appraisal of their desirability. Although all of the empirical results I discuss pertain to United States data, they suggest the type of empirical analyses that should be undertaken with Canadian data before decisions about policy changes are made here. I begin in the first main section with a brief history of hours of work legislation in the United States that includes a conceptual framework that I have found useful in analyzing proposed changes in hours legislation. The variety of empirical analyses I have undertaken that pertain to the wisdom of raising the overtime premium are discussed in the second section. My analyses of proposals to require employee consent prior to the working of overtime are discussed in the third section. The paper ends with some brief concluding remarks...|$|R
40|$|Pluralist {{scholars}} argue {{strongly that}} common law is heavily stacked against employees, by its placing {{a premium on}} the contract of employment. According to iconic labour law jurist, Otto Kahn-Freund, in doing so, common law inappropriately presumes an equality of power between the employer and employee. Whereas the reality is that, â€œâ€¦ the relation between an employer and an isolated employee or worker is typically a relation between a bearer of power and one {{who is not a}} bearer of powerâ€¦â€ Common law frowns on collective bargaining and imposes strenuous duties on the employee and relatively light obligations on the employer. In real life the liberty of contract it presumes becomes merely illusory. This was aptly recognized in S v Collet, where the court rejected the employerâ€™s defence that he had inflicted corporal punishment on his employee for misconduct in terms of the contract of employment. The court held: In the relationship of master and servant the role of the master is, of course the dominant one and that of the servant is a subservient one. Even in the field of contract, it has long been recognized that public policy requires that he be protected from the disadvantageous consequences of agreements he may have felt obliged to enter into with his master, the reason being that as a servant he is not conducting on equal terms with his master. Working struggles over the years have sought to place restraint on the arbitrary powers of the employers and infuse in the employment relationship, values based on notions of fairness, equity and social justice, including the right to <b>fair</b> <b>labour</b> practices and <b>standards.</b> For {{the first time in the}} history of labour relations in Zimbabwe, the right to <b>fair</b> <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> and practices has become enshrined in the Declaration of Rights as a basic human right. Section 65 (1) of the Constitution provides: â€œEvery person has the right to <b>fair</b> and safe <b>labour</b> practices and <b>standards</b> and to be paid a fair and reasonable wage. â€ This section provides probably the most significant labour rights under the new Constitution. This is because of its all-encompassing nature covering the right to <b>fair</b> <b>labour</b> practices and <b>standards,</b> the right to safe <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> and the right to a fair and reasonable wage. It has the potential for the dramatic overhaul of labour jurisprudence in the country by the incorporation of advances made by the working class regionally and internationally.

2500|$|To get <b>fair</b> <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> {{beyond the}} minimum, the most {{important}} right is to collectively participate in decisions about how an enterprise is managed. This works through collective bargaining, underpinned by the right to strike, and a growing set of rights of direct workplace participation. Workers {{must be able to}} vote for trustees of their occupational pensions under the Pensions Act 2004. In some enterprises, such as universities, staff can vote for the directors of the organisation. In enterprises with over 50 staff, workers must be informed and consulted about major economic developments or difficulties. This happens through a steadily increasing number of work councils, which usually must be requested by staff. However, the UK remains behind European standards in requiring all employees to have a vote for their company's board of directors, alongside private sector shareholders, or government authorities in the public sector. Collective bargaining, between democratically organised trade unions and the enterprise's management, has been seen as a [...] "single channel" [...] for individual workers to counteract the employer's abuse of power when it dismisses staff or fix the terms of work. Collective agreements are ultimately backed up by a trade union's right to strike: a fundamental requirement of democratic society in international law. Under the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 strikes are basically lawful if they are [...] "in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute".|$|R
40|$|The food {{industry}} {{has always been}} a major generator of economic activity in the Greater Toronto Area. However, recently the innovative and creative elements of the industry have changed. Since the mid- 1990 s, the fastest growing segment within the industry has been small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The specialty, ethnic, and organic SMEs (hereinafter referred to as the ‘creative-food’ industry) appear to be particularly innovative as they respond to consumer demand for local, fresh, ethnic, and fusion cuisine. On the basis of sixty-five interviews with food producers, processors, restaurateurs, food media, non-government organizations, government, and private sector agencies, it is suggested that this creative-food sector is thriving despite existing public policies that bias toward large-scale, industrialized agri-food firms in the region. As such, a disconnect currently exists between, on the one hand, the traditional agrifood paradigm that the government regulatory environment is promoting and, on the other hand, the locally consumer-driven food cluster that is emerging. Public policies of multiculturalism and education have done more to facilitate the unprecedented growth of this creative subcomponent of the food sector than have explicit public food-policy initiatives. However, there is still room for policy initiatives that advance the development of this dynamic sector, especially in the area of supportive infrastructure, access to health-based ethnically appropriate food, food education, and <b>fair</b> <b>labour</b> <b>standards.</b> Contrary to a widely held view, the creative-{{food industry}} is not just about promoting exclusive foods for the pleasure of urban elite. Rather, it offers an opportunity for a more socially inclusive and sustainable urban development model. The findings also have implications for multilevel governance in cluster formation and policy, future research on food, as well as for theories on innovation, urban creativity, and governance. ...|$|R

Hours worked in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) sample increased monotonically from 2. 5 for the 14 -year-olds to 16. 2 for the 18 -year-olds, and among those who worked positive hours, it increased from 8. 9 to 24. 5. This evidence is, de facto, in compliance with the FLSA regulations on weekly hours. The aim {{of this paper is to}} assess one of the underlying premises for the legislation, namely that working while attending high school could adversely affect school performance. We formulate and estimate an explicit sequential decision model of high school attendance and work that captures in a stylized fashion the important institutional features of high school grade progression. Individuals accumulate credits (courses) towards graduation depending on the individual’s history of performance (knowledge acquisition), the level of participation in the labour market (hours worked) and their known (to them) ability and motivation. The labour market (randomly) offers wages for part-time and full-time employment that depend also on some inherent skill ‘endowment’ and labour market experience. The value of attending high school consists of both the perceived investment pay-off to graduation and on a current consumption value which is random. We simplify the model by assuming that a terminal condition for decisions during the high school period and its value can be estimated as an additional parameter of the model. Our results indicate that a policy that forced youths to remain in high school for five years or until they graduate, whichever comes first, without working would increase the number of high school graduates by slightly more than 2 percentage points (from 82 % to 84. 1 %). academic performance; Employment; Heterogeneity; high school; maximum likelihood...|$|R

The {{purpose of}} this study is to compare and contrast, through a {{literature}} review, the compliance of the Republic of Korea (ROK) and the Republic of South Africa to the minimum <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> of the International <b>Labour</b> <b>Standards</b> (ILO). The minimum standards are established as the core <b>labour</b> <b>standards,</b> embodied in the eight fundamental conventions. The ROK and South Africa’s labour laws and labour practices are benchmarked against the ILO’s International <b>Labour</b> <b>Standards</b> (ILS) in order to compare these practices and to establish if these <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> comply with the minimum standards set by the ILO. The propositions stated are: that the ROK and South African <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> differ, that South African <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> comply with the minimum <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> of the ILO; and that ROK <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> do not comply with the minimum standards of the ILO.

The two countries’ labour relations histories, labour laws, labour relations institutions and rule making strategies are described as part of the labour practices in these countries. The labour practices in each country are analysed and benchmarked against the ILO ILS in order to identify an inconsistency between law and practice. In South Africa, the Constitution includes all international laws when interpreting South African law. The only exceptions are when the Constitution or when an act of Parliament specifically excludes the contents of such a law. The conclusion is that South Africa complies with ILO ILS.
