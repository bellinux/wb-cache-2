Accordingly, Three hundred and eighty-four camels were examined and <b>mange</b> <b>mite</b> infestation was detected on 64 of camels. Only Sarcoptes scabiei var. cameli was identified as the only mite species in all skin scraping samples collected from the suspected <b>mange</b> <b>mite</b> lesions. There was {{significant difference in the}} prevalence of <b>mange</b> <b>mite</b> infestation between male and female camels (p 0. 05). The result indicated that camel <b>mange</b> <b>mite</b> infestation was a problem in northern part of Ethiopia, hence, further studies and strategic control measures are recommended to reduce the effect of <b>mange</b> <b>mite</b> infestation on camel husbandry...|$|R

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} {{study was conducted}} between November 2011 and March 2012 to determine the prevalence of <b>mange</b> <b>mites</b> and to identify the major mite species affecting small ruminants in Haramaya wereda (district), East Harerghe zone, Eastern Ethiopia. A total of 810 animals from both species (384 sheep and 421 goats) were sampled using the formula of [1]. The study showed that the prevalence of <b>mange</b> <b>mite</b> in sheep and goats was 3. 34 % and 5. 94 %, respectively. From 197 and 613, young and adult small ruminants examined for <b>mange</b> <b>mites</b> the recorded prevalence rate was 6. 09 % and 4. 61 %, respectively whereas among 373 and 437, male and female small ruminants examined for <b>mange</b> <b>mites</b> the prevalence rate of 4. 02 and 5. 26 % was recorded, respectively. The prevalence rate recorded in lowland and midland was 4. 22 % and 2. 77 %, respectively. No statistically significant association was observed between the prevalence rate and different species, age and sex of the animals (p> 0. 05). However, there was statistically significant association between the prevalence rate of mange infestation and agro-ecological zones (p< 0. 05). The major species of mites identified were sarcoptes spp, psoroptes spp and demodex spp in goat and only psoroptes spp in sheep. From the <b>mange</b> <b>mite</b> species-affecting goats, sarcoptes scabies was the most prevalent species observed on 4. 28 % of the goats followed by psoroptes ovis (0. 95 %) and demodex caprae (0. 71 %). In sheep, the prevalence of the only identified species, psoroptes ovis was 3. 34 %.

40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} carried out in order to {{determine}} the prevalence of <b>mange</b> <b>mite</b> of goats, their species composition and associated risk factors in and around Kombolcha, Northeastern Ethiopia. Both questionnaire and cross-sectional study were employed. The result of the questionnaire survey indicated that goats were the main species of animals owned by the farmers and mange was a known and considered as an important disease by small ruminant holders. The cross sectional study {{was carried out}} on 350 goats (238 female and 112 male). Accordingly the overall infestation rate of <b>mange</b> <b>mites</b> was 11. 7 % (41 of 350). Prevalence of 5. 1 % and 6. 6 % was observed in and around Kombolcha, respectively; however, there was insignificant difference (P> 0. 05) in the two study areas. The highest level of infestation was observed in female adult goats (9. 1 %) than in male adult goats (2. 6 %). However, there was no statistically significant difference (P> 0. 05) between the different age and sex groups. On the other hand, the prevalence of <b>mange</b> <b>mites</b> in poor body conditioned (7. 4 %) animals was significantly higher than (P< 0. 05) those of the good body condition (3. 1 %) animals. With regard to species composition Sarcoptes sp. and Demodex sp. were identified with the prevalence of 10. 6 % and 1. 1 %, respectively. Demodex sp. was not observed on good body conditioned and young goats, whereas, Sarcoptes sp. were found on both poor and good body condition as well as in different age groups. In conclusion, <b>mange</b> <b>mite</b> of goats had been observed to decrease in its extent of infestation problem because of the endeavors on disease control launched in the study area. Therefore, it was the suggestion of this study to further strengthen the efforts to put the disease under control...|$|R

Two hundred cases of dermatologic disease from the formentioned province were investigated by conducting deep skin scraping between May 2011 and October 2012. The overall prevalence was 25 %. Sarcoptic scabiei uniculi (22. 5 %) was the most frequent mite, followed by Notoedres cati cuniculi (2. 5 %). To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of Notoedres cati cuniculi among studied rabbits in the study region.
