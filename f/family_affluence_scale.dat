40|$|Assessments of {{socioeconomic}} position (SEP) and relative deprivation {{are important to}} many areas of child and adolescent research. These related constructs are typically measured using data on household income or parental education or occupation. However, because such data {{can be difficult to}} collect in youth surveys, the World Health Organisation’s Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study uses an inventory of common material assets in the home. The HBSC <b>Family</b> <b>Affluence</b> <b>Scale</b> is used to measure socioeconomic conditions in 11 - to 15 -year-olds in over 40 countries. This article examines the importance of SEP and relative deprivation to adolescent health and demonstrates simple calculations of these variables using the data from the <b>Family</b> <b>Affluence</b> <b>Scale.</b> We show how to transform a summation of material assets to a SEP index and apply Yitzhaki’s (1979) index of relative deprivation to material assets using schoolmates as a social comparison group.

40|$|The aim was {{to develop}} and test a brief revised version of the <b>family</b> <b>affluence</b> <b>scale.</b> A total of 7120 {{students}} from Denmark, Greenland, Italy, Norway, Poland, Romania, Scotland and Slovakia reported {{on a list of}} 16 potential indicators of affluence. Responses were subject to item screening and test of dimensionality. Bifactor analysis revealed a strong general factor of affluence in all countries, but with additional specific factors in all countries. The specific factors mainly reflected overlapping item content. Item screening was conducted to eliminate items with low discrimination and local dependence, reducing the number of items from sixteen to six: Number of computers, number of cars, own bedroom, holidays abroad, dishwasher, and bathroom. The six-item version was estimated with Samejima’s graded response model, and tested for differential item functioning by country. Three of the six items were invariant across countries, thus anchoring the scale to a common metric across countries.

40|$|Study objective: To {{examine the}} {{completion}} rate, internal reliability, and external validity {{of a home}} <b>affluence</b> <b>scale</b> based on adolescents' reports of material circumstances in the home {{as a measure of}} family socioeconomic status. Design: Cross sectional survey. Setting: Data were collected from a school based study in seven schools in the north of England Cheshire over a five month period from September 1999 to January 2000. Participants: 1824 students (1248 girls, 567 boys) aged 13 – 15 years who were attending normal classes in Years 9 and 10 in 7 schools on the days of data collection. Main results: Comparatively poor completion rates were found for questions on parental education and occupation while material deprivation items had much higher completion rates. There was evidence that students with poorer material circumstances were less able to report parental education and occupation whereas material based questions showed less bias. A home <b>affluence</b> <b>scale</b> composed of material items was found to have adequate internal reliability and good external validity. Conclusions: A home <b>affluence</b> <b>scale</b> based on material markers provides a useful alternative in assessing <b>family</b> <b>affluence</b> in adolescents. Additionally, it prevents exclusion of those less materially well off adolescents who fail to complete conventional socioeconomic status items. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{was funded by}} NHS Health Scotland. Background Early sexual initiation and inadequate contraceptive use can place adolescents at increased risk of unplanned pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. These behaviours are patterned by gender and {{may be linked to}} social inequalities. This paper examines trends in sexual initiation and contraceptive use by gender and <b>family</b> <b>affluence</b> for Scottish adolescents. Methods Cross-sectional data from four nationally-representative survey cycles (2002, 2004, 2010, 2014) (n= 8, 895) (mean age = 15. 57) were analysed. Logistic regressions examined the impact of survey year on sexual initiation, condom use and birth control pill use at last sex; as well as any changes over time in association between <b>family</b> <b>affluence</b> and the three sexual behaviours. Analyses were stratified by gender. Results Between 2002 and 2014, adolescent males and females became less likely to report having had sex. Low <b>family</b> <b>affluence</b> females {{were more likely to have}} had sex than high <b>family</b> <b>affluence</b> females, and this relationship did not change over time. Condom use at last sex was reported less by males since 2002, and by females since 2006. Low <b>family</b> <b>affluence</b> males and females were less likely to use condoms than high <b>family</b> <b>affluence</b> participants, and these relationships did not change over time. There were no effects of time or <b>family</b> <b>affluence</b> for birth control pill use. Conclusion There has been a reduction in the proportion of 15 -year olds in Scotland who have ever had sex, but also a decrease in condom use for this group.

40|$|Many {{indicators}} of socioeconomic status used for adults are inappropriate {{for use in}} research on adolescents. In a school-based survey of 4079 Scottish schoolchildren using a self-completion questionnaire, over 20 % of 11 - 15 year olds were unable to provide a substantive response on father's occupation. In contrast, indicators derived to construct a <b>family</b> <b>affluence</b> <b>scale,</b> which included car ownership, telephone owner-ship and the child having their own unshared bedroom, resulted in a 98 % response rate; and 92 % of children responded to a question on their weekly spending money. The intercorrelations between the conventional indicator of father's occupation and each family affluence and spending money were examined, and their asso-ciations {{with a range of}} health indicators and health behaviour measures compared. Father's occupational status and family affluence were moderately correlated and showed broadly sim-ilar patterns of association with the selected health measures although there were also some distinct differences. Child's spending money was only weakly correlated with father's occupation and showed rather different patterns of associ-ation with health measures.

40|$|The {{principle}} {{objective of}} this study was to assess the association between socio-economic status (SES) and oral health-related behaviours in Korean adolescents aged 13 - 18, using the <b>Family</b> <b>Affluence</b> <b>Scale</b> (FAS). The secondary objective was to assess the influences of other factors (pocket money, school type, family structure and psychological factors) on this association. Cross-sectional data were from the national 2007 Korean Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey. Oral health-related behaviours included health-enhancing behaviours (frequency of toothbrushing and dental visits) and health-compromising behaviours (smoking and frequency of intake of soft drinks and confections). Logistic regression models were used to analyse the data. To assess the influence of other factors, additional models adjusting for sex, school grade and each of the other factors were compared to the initial model, which adjusted for sex and school grade only. We found that family affluence had a linear association with health-enhancing behaviours and a roughly U-shaped association with health-compromising behaviours. After adjusting for a number of variables, the linear association with health-enhancing behaviours persisted. The U-shaped association with health-compromising behaviours remained but was partly attenuated and flattened. In addition, we found a marked influence of school type and family structure and pocket money on the association between FAS and oral health-compromising behaviours. The findings indicate that the health-enhancing behaviours of adolescents were strongly associated with family affluence, but the health-compromising behaviours were more strongly linked to factors other than family affluence. However, it is difficult to determine which factors contribute most in relation to family affluence because of other confounding factors, such as the education system, peer group, youth culture, part-time work and advertising. Therefore, further studies are needed to assess factors that interact with family SES to better understand the association between the SES and the oral health-compromising behaviours of adolescents.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{study of}} {{socio-economic}} inequalities from a cross-national perspective has been {{hampered by the}} lack of adequate common indices of socio-economic status {{that can be used in}} a self-report survey instrument. This paper examines the construction and the properties of global social indexes in general, and of the <b>Family</b> <b>Affluence</b> <b>Scale</b> (henceforth FAS) in particular. The paper proposes a new strategy for making comparisons of the global index with strati-fied data, building a revised FAS based on Adapted Canonical Variate Analysis (henceforth ACVA). This alternative strategy for constructing a global index is available in standard software, and the new proposal for stratified data only requires a simple program, which is justified, explained and provided in the text.

40|$|Objectives: We {{explored}} {{the association between}} socioeconomic position and four different aspects of adolescent health behavior {{in a wide range}} of European countries, the US, Canada and Israel. Methods: Data were collected from the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study in 2002. Representative samples of 13 and 15 year olds completed a standardised questionnaire during school hours in each country. Logistic regression analyses were used to investigate the independent effect of parental occupation and <b>family</b> <b>affluence</b> on tobacco and alcohol use, vegetable consumption and TV viewing. Results: <b>Family</b> <b>affluence</b> showed no significant association with regular smoking in most countries, whereas an increase in smoking with decreasing occupational status was found in half of the countries. For alcohol consumption a positive association was found with <b>family</b> <b>affluence</b> in half of the countries, while no relationship with parental occupation was observed. Both measures of socioeconomic position were strong independent predictors for vegetable consumption and television viewing in almost all countries. Conclusions: The findings suggest that health behaviours that begin to develop in adolescence are less strongly influenced by parental socioeconomic position.

40|$|Plateauing {{and rising}} levels of obesity and {{overweight}} {{in children and}} youth are growing concerns and the relations between socio-economic status (SES) and dietary behaviour and weight outcomes are very varied across countries. Empirical findings about the influences of socio-economic status (SES) on these health behaviours and outcomes differ depending on the measurement of SES used. Considering alternative conceptualisations of SES (measuring absolute, relative or subjective dimensions) is therefore advocated when analysing health inequalities in countries {{with high levels of}} overall affluence. As a country with high overall affluence and growing inequalities, Luxembourg allows for a further exploration of socio-economic inequalities in dietary behaviour and weight outcomes of young people in affluent contexts. The analysis aims to identify the relation between socio-economic inequalities and the dietary behaviour and weight outcomes of young people in Luxembourg. Data relating to <b>family</b> <b>affluence,</b> perceived wealth, dietary behaviour and BMI was gathered from 11 to 18 year-old pupils (n= 7233) using the HBSC questionnaire {{in the context of the}} 2014 HBSC wave in Luxembourg and is analysed using multiple logistic regression. The results indicate that there are different patterns of association of absolute, relative and subjective affluence with dietary behaviour and weight outcomes of young people aged between 11 and 18 in Luxembourg. While weight outcomes are socially stratified by all aspects of <b>family</b> <b>affluence,</b> after adjustment for overweight body image is associated to subjective <b>family</b> <b>affluence</b> and weight reduction behaviour is associated to absolute and relative <b>family</b> <b>affluence.</b> The results thus confirm a differentiated association of different aspects of SES to dietary behaviour and weight outcomes and confirm, that health inequalities between health outcomes or behaviours are linked to different processes...|$|R
40|$|Attempts to {{describe}} and explain socio-economic differences in health have mainly focused on adults. Little {{is known about the}} mechanisms of the relationship between socio-economic status (SES) and health in adolescence including inconsistent findings between SES and health among young people. Data were derived from representative samples of 13 and 15 -year-old students in 33 European and North American countries (nÂ =Â  97, 721) as part of the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study 2001 / 2002. Multilevel logistic regression models were used to investigate socio-economic differences in self-rated health among adolescents and the contribution of health-related behaviours to the explanation of such differences. Odds ratios of self-rated health by <b>family</b> <b>affluence</b> were calculated before and after adjustment for behavioural factors (tobacco smoking, physical activity, television use, breakfast intake, consumption of fruits and vegetables). On average, adolescents from low affluent families had an odds ratio for low self-rated health of 1. 84 for boys and 1. 80 for girls, compared to those from high affluent families. The majority of behavioural factors were significantly associated with <b>family</b> <b>affluence</b> in all countries and explained part of the relationship between self-rated health and <b>family</b> <b>affluence.</b> Smoking, physical activity and breakfast consumption showed the largest independent effect on health. The present study suggests that behavioural factors in early adolescence partly account for the association between self-rated health and socio-economic status. Prevention programmes should target unhealthy behaviours of adolescents from lower socio-economic groups to help prevent future life-course disadvantages in terms of health and social inequalities.

40|$|BackgroundWe {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the extent to which three core variables (school environment, peer group and <b>family</b> <b>affluence)</b> were associated with unhealthy behaviours and health outcomes among Tuscan adolescents. The unhealthy behaviours considered were smoking, alcohol consumption, sedentary lifestyle and irregular breakfast consumption; health outcomes were classified as self-reported health, multiple health complaints and life satisfaction. School environment was measured in terms of liking school, school pressure, academic achievement and classmate support; peer groups were evaluated in terms of the number of peers and frequency of peer contact. <b>Family</b> <b>affluence</b> was measured on a socioeconomic scale. MethodsData were taken from the Tuscan 2009 / 10 survey of ¿Health Behaviour in School-aged Children¿, a WHO cross-national survey. A binary logistic multiple regression (95 % confidence intervals) was implemented. ResultsThe total sample comprised 3291 school students: 1135 11 -year-olds, 1255 13 -year-olds and 901 15 -year-olds. Peer group and school environment were associated with unhealthy behaviours such as smoking, alcohol consumption and sedentary lifestyle. <b>Family</b> <b>affluence</b> proved to have less impact on unhealthy behaviours, except in the case of adolescents living in low-income families. Poor health outcomes were directly related to a negative school environment. Regarding the influence of <b>family</b> <b>affluence,</b> the results showed higher odds of life dissatisfaction and poor self-reported health status in medium-income families, while low-income families had higher odds only with regard to life dissatisfaction.

The {{purpose of the present study}} was to describe trends in daily breakfast consumption (DBC) among adolescents across 31 countries participating in the HBSC survey between 2002 to 2010 and to identify socio-demographic (gender, <b>family</b> <b>affluence</b> and <b>family</b> structure) correlates of DBC. Cross-sectional surveys including nationally representative samples of 11 - 15 year olds (n = 455, 391). Multilevel logistic regression analyses modeled DBC over time after adjusting for <b>family</b> <b>affluence,</b> <b>family</b> structure and year of survey. In all countries, children in two-parent families were more likely to report DBC compared to single parent families. In most countries (n = 19), DBC was associated with <b>family</b> <b>affluence.</b> Six countries showed an increase in DBC (Canada, Netherland, Macedonia, Scotland, Wales, England) from 2002. A significant decrease in DBC from 2002 was found in 11 countries (Belgium Fr, France, Germany, Croatia, Spain, Poland, Russian Federation, Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania and Norway), while in 5 countries (Portugal, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Sweden) no significant changes were seen. Frequency of DBC among adolescents in European countries and North America showed a more uniform pattern in 2010 as compared to patterns in 2002.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Numerous health {{problems}} are initiated in childhood and adolescence. For example, obesity, which has increased significantly in recent years, often begins in early life. The {{objective of this}} study was to describe social inequalities in obesity and other {{health problems}} among adolescents by sex. METHODS: Data come from a cross-sectional study conducted in a representative sample of 903 adolescents aged 12 - 16 years old, from secondary schools in Barcelona, Spain. Associations between socioeconomic indicators and health outcomes (perceived health status and, overweight and obesity) were examined through Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) models. All the analyses were stratified by sex. RESULTS: Boys were more likely to report very good perceived health status than girls (64. 1 % and 46. 3 % respectively).

METHODS: Data were from the 'Health Behaviour in School-aged Children' study 2005 / 2006 including 6511 15 -year-old adolescents from Flemish Belgium, Canada, Romania and England. Socioeconomic status was measured using the <b>Family</b> <b>Affluence</b> <b>Scale</b> (FAS). Social capital was indicated by friend-related social capital, participation in school and voluntary organizations, trust and reciprocity in family, neighborhood and school. We conducted pooled logistic regression models with interaction terms and tested for cross-national differences. RESULTS: Almost all {{dimensions of}} social capital were associated with a lower likelihood of smoking, except for friend-related social capital and school participation. The association of family-related social capital with smoking was significantly stronger for low FAS adolescents, whereas the association of vertical trust and reciprocity in school with smoking was significantly stronger for high FAS adolescents.

40|$|Background: This study {{examined}} urban–rural and socioeconomic differences in adolescent toothbrushing. Methods: The data were modelled using logistic multilevel modelling and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method of estimation. Twice-a-day toothbrushing was regressed upon age, <b>family</b> <b>affluence,</b> <b>family</b> structure, school type, area-level deprivation and rurality, {{for boys and}} girls separately. Results: Boys’ toothbrushing was associated with area-level deprivation but not rurality. Variance at the school level remained significant in the final model for boys' toothbrushing. The association between toothbrushing and area-level deprivation was particularly strong for girls, after adjustment for individuals’ <b>family</b> <b>affluence</b> and type of school attended.

METHODS: Data from the Slovak national HBSC study 2014 were analyzed. The sample comprised 1549 15 -year-old adolescents (mean age: 15. 4; 52. 5 % boys). RTBs were defined as early sexual experience, truancy, fighting, bullying, early smoking initiation and drunkenness. The associations between LD status and RTBs were assessed using binary logistic regression; the mediating as well as moderating role of <b>family</b> <b>affluence</b> and <b>family</b> composition was explored as well. RESULTS: Adolescents with LD are two times more likely to be engaged in early sexual experiences (OR 2. 39; 95 % CI 1. 45 - 3. 95), fighting (OR 1. 72; 95 % CI 1. 01 - 2. 95) and bullying (OR 2. 08; 95 % CI 1. 26 - 3. 44), but not in early smoking initiation, drunkenness or truancy. <b>Family</b> <b>affluence</b> and <b>family</b> composition did not moderate or mediate these associations. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents with LD are at high risk of early sexual experiences, fighting and bullying but not of smoking initiation, drunkenness or truancy. Non-intact and poor families do not increase the risks associated with LD status of adolescents; however, in these families adolescents with LD are more prevalent...|$|R
40|$|Seeing smoking depictions {{in movies}} has been {{identified}} as a determinant of smoking in adolescents. Little is known about how such media influences interact with other social risk factors. Differences in smoking rates in different socio-economic status groups might be explainable by differences in media exposure. There might also be differences in the average response to movie smoking exposure. We tested this hypothesis within a cross-national study conducted in six European countries. A total of 16, 551 pupils from Germany, Iceland, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, and Scotland {{with a mean age of}} 13. 4 years (SD = 1. 18) were recruited from 114 state funded schools. Using previously validated methods, exposure to smoking depictions in movies was estimated for each student and related to ever smoking. The analysis was stratified by level of <b>family</b> <b>affluence</b> (low, medium, high) and migration history of parents (yes vs. no), controlling for a number of covariates like age, gender, school performance, television screen time, sensation seeking and rebelliousness and smoking within the social environment (peers, parents, siblings). We found a significant association for each category of <b>family</b> <b>affluence</b> and ethnicity between ever smoking and movie smoking exposure, also significant adjusted odds ratios for age, school performance, sensation seeking, peer smoking, mother smoking, and sibling smoking. This relationship between movie smoking and adolescent smoking was not moderated by <b>family</b> <b>affluence</b> or ethnicity. Although we used a very broad measure of economic status and migration history, the results suggest that the effects of exposure to movie smoking can be generalized to the population of youths across European countries...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Tobacco-related heath inequalities are a {{major public}} health concern, with smoking being more {{prevalent}} among lower socioeconomic groups. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the mechanisms leading to socioeconomic inequalities in smoking among 15 -year-old adolescents by examining the mediating role of psychosocial factors in the peer group, family and school environment. METHODS Data were derived from the international WHO-collaborative 'Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) ' study 2005 / 2006, including 52 907 15 -year-old students from 35 European and North American countries. Socioeconomic position was measured by the <b>Family</b> <b>Affluence</b> <b>Scale.</b> Multilevel logistic regression models were conducted to examine the contribution of family, school and peer factors in explaining the association between family affluence and weekly smoking. RESULTS Across countries, adolescents from low affluent families had an increased risk of weekly smoking (ORboys 1. 14, confidence interval (CI) 1. 05 - 1. 23; ORgirls 1. 36, CI 1. 26 - 1. 46) compared with adolescents from high affluent families. Family and school factors mediated the association between family affluence and smoking to a high extent up to 100...|$|E
40|$|AIMS To {{examine the}} role of {{national}} wealth in the association between family affluence and adolescent weekly smoking, early smoking behavior and weekly smoking among former experimenters. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS Data were used from the 'Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) ' study conducted in 2005 / 2006 in 35 countries from Europe and North America that comprises 60, 490 students aged 15 years. Multilevel logistic regression was conducted using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods (MCMC) to explore whether associations between family affluence and smoking outcomes were dependent on national wealth. MEASUREMENT <b>Family</b> <b>Affluence</b> <b>Scale</b> (FAS) as an indicator for the socioeconomic position of students. Current weekly smoking behavior is defined as at least weekly smoking (dichotomous). Early smoking behavior is measured by smoking more than a first puff before age 13 (dichotomous). Weekly smoking among former experimenters is restricted to those who tried a first puff in the past. FINDINGS The logistic multilevel models indicated an association of family affluence with current weekly smoking [Odds ratio (OR) = 1. 088; 95...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. One {{explanation}} {{for a lack}} of consistency in SES-health associations in youth is that parent-based income and occupation measures are inadequate. The <b>Family</b> <b>Affluence</b> <b>Scale</b> (FAS), a four-item measure of family wealth, has been developed in the WHO Health Behaviour in School-aged Children Study as an alternative measure. The aim {{of this paper is to}} examine the criterion and construct validity of the FAS as a measure of national absolute wealth in 35 countries. A general measure of national wealth, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the year 2001, corrected for Purchasing Power Parity, was used as a gold standard. For the composite FAS index, there was a similar strength in country rank order correlation (0. 87) as with GDP, and a Kappa agreement coefficient of 0. 57, indicating good criterion validity. FAS index associations with national health indicators were sys-tematically higher than the values obtained with GDP. These features suggest that FAS can be used with confidence in aggregate analyses of HBSC data that focus on relationships between SES and adolescent health...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Behavioral {{factors such}} as (excessive) alcohol {{consumption}} {{play a major role}} in the explanation of social inequalities in health. The unequal distribution of health risk behaviors among socio-economic groups has important consequences for both the current and future health status of the younger generation. However, little is known about socio-economic differences in unhealthy lifestyles during adolescence. The purpose of the present study is to investigate socio-economic differences in adolescent drinking behaviour among 11 – 15 year old adolescents in Europe and North America. Methods Data was obtained from the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study 2001 / 02, a cross-national survey conducted in collaboration with the World Health Organization. The present analysis is based on 69249 male and 73619 female students from 28 countries. The effect of parental occupation and <b>family</b> <b>affluence</b> on episodes of drunkenness was assessed using separate logistic regression models controlling for age. Results Socio-economic circumstances of the family had only a limited effect on repeated drunkenness in adolescence. For girls only in one out of 28 countries a significant association between <b>family</b> <b>affluence</b> and repeated drunkenness was observed, while boys from low and/or medium affluent families in nine countries faced a lower risk of drunkenness than boys from more affluent families. Regarding parental occupation, significant differences in episodes of drunkenness were found in nine countries for boys and in six countries for girls. Compared to <b>family</b> <b>affluence,</b> which was positively related to risk of drunkenness, a decreasing occupational status predicted an increasing risk of drunkenness. This pattern was identified within a number of countries, most noticeably for boys. Conclusion Parental socio-economic status is only of limited importance for episodes of drunkenness in early adolescence, and this very limited role seems to apply for girls more than for boys and for parental occupation more than <b>family</b> <b>affluence.</b> For future studies it might be important to look at the effects of socio-economic status within the context of other peer, family and school related factors in order to assess to what extent those factors might mediate the effects of social class background. </p...|$|R

40|$|To examine {{socioeconomic}} {{differences in}} adolescent alcohol use in Germany {{as well as}} their changes between 1994 and 2006. Data were obtained from the "Health Behaviour in School-aged Children" study conducted in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany in 1994, 1998, 2002 and 2006. The analysis is based on 5. 074 15 -year-old students. Prevalence and trends were analysed for each category of <b>family</b> <b>affluence</b> and educational track separately using log-binominal regression models. An increase in weekly alcohol use between 1994 and 2002 was followed by a strong decrease from 2002 to 2006. <b>Family</b> <b>affluence</b> only had a weak effect on weekly drinking with a tendency for lower-affluent students reporting less alcohol use. Educational track showed almost no relationship with weekly alcohol use. Trend analyses within the subgroups revealed that the overall trend in alcohol use was similar in all socioeconomic and educational groups. Socioeconomic patterns in drinking behaviour are not yet developed in 15 -year-old adolescents. Adolescence could therefore be an important time frame for tackling inequalities in alcohol use later in life...|$|R
