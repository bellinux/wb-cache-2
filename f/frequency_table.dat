2500|$|Zipf's law {{states that}} given some corpus of natural {{language}} utterances, {{the frequency of}} any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the <b>frequency</b> <b>table.</b> Thus the most frequent word will occur approximately twice as often as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent word, etc.: the rank-frequency distribution is an inverse relation. For example, in the Brown Corpus of American English text, the word [...] "the" [...] is the most frequently occurring word, and by itself accounts for nearly 7% of all word occurrences (69,971 out of slightly over 1 million). True to Zipf's Law, the second-place word [...] "of" [...] accounts for slightly over 3.5% of words (36,411 occurrences), followed by [...] "and" [...] (28,852). Only 135 vocabulary items are needed to account for half the Brown Corpus.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY. This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with extracting and summarizing the spatial pattern that may be present in landcover and other thematic raster maps. A sequence of rather large <b>frequency</b> <b>tables</b> is calculated by scanning the map and recording the landcover in configurations of four pixels whose inter-pixel distances become increasingly large. Perceived spatial pattern in a map is determined in part by dominance in the marginal landcover distribution. Likewise, the calculated <b>frequency</b> <b>tables</b> are much affected by the marginal landcover distribution. In order to adjust for this effect and extract a measure of intrinsic spatial pattern, we compare the actual <b>frequency</b> <b>tables</b> to what we would expect the tables to be if landcover were assigned to pixels as independent random draws from the marginal landcover distribution, i. e., for a pattern-free map.

40|$|Important {{questions}} can be answered using <b>frequency</b> <b>tables.</b> However, when publishing or releasing <b>frequency</b> <b>tables,</b> many data custodians are legally required {{to ensure that the}} risk of disclosing information about a person or organisation is acceptably low. A relatively recent way of releasing <b>frequency</b> <b>tables</b> is via a remote server. A remote server automatically responds to queries on the micro-data that are submitted by analysts, but it does not allow analysts to view the underlying micro-data. The challenge is to develop an automatic response to queries that has an acceptable disclosure risk releases tables that are useful to analysts. This paper describes the methodology underlying the Australian Bureau of Statistic 2 ̆ 7 remote server, called TableBuilder, for releasing <b>frequency</b> <b>tables.</b> We introduce a framework for measuring the disclosure risk of allowing analysts access to micro-data via TableBuilder. We apply this framework to meaure the disclosure risk of micro-data created by linking the Australian Population Census to administrative migration data, supplied by the Australian Department of Immigration and Customs. We conclude that a remote server provides a very effective balance between disclosure risk and utility...|$|R
