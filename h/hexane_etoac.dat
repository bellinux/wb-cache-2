40|$|The {{antioxidant}} {{potential of}} Actinidia macrosperma C. F. Liang (Actinidiaceae) {{was investigated in}} vitro for total phenolic content, along with total antioxidant activity (TAA), 1, 1 -diphenyl 2 -picryl hydrazyl (DPPH), and lipid peroxidation (LP). The results indicated that different polarity extracts of A. macrosperma exhibit different biological activities, which depends mainly {{on the presence of}} phenolic compounds. The antioxidant activity was in the following decreasing order: MeOH extract > EtOAc extract > aqueous extract > CHCl 3 extract > Hexane extract. Moreover, the cytotoxic activity of this plant by MTT dye assay using SMMC- 7721 has been determined also. The <b>hexane,</b> <b>EtOAc,</b> and CHCl 3 extracts showed cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. Methanol and aqueous extracts, however, showed weak activities in this test. And a very significant cytotoxic activity, not significantly different from the positive control of quercetin, was observed in CHCl 3 extract...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to assess antioxidant activities of methanolic extracts from the leaves of 18 indigenous tree species in Taiwan. Results revealed that, among 18 species, Acer oliverianum exhibited the best free radical scavenging activities. The IC 50 values were 5. 8 and 11. 8 [*]μg/mL on DPPH radical and superoxide radical scavenging activities, respectively. In addition, A. oliverianum also exhibited the strongest ferrous ion chelating activity. Based on a bioactivity-guided isolation principle, the resulting methanolic crude extracts of A. oliverianum leaves were fractionated to yield soluble fractions of <b>hexane,</b> <b>EtOAc,</b> BuOH, and water. Of these, the EtOAc fraction had the best antioxidant activity. Furthermore, 8 specific phytochemicals were isolated and identified from the EtOAc fraction. Among them, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 -O-penta-galloyl-β-D-glucopyranose had the best free radical scavenging activity. These results demonstrate that methanolic extracts and their derived phytochemicals of A. oliverianum leaves have excellent antioxidant activities and thus they have great potential as sources for natural health products...|$|E
40|$|Antrodia camphorata {{grown on}} germinated brown rice (CBR) was {{prepared}} to suppress melanoma development. CBR extracts were divided into <b>hexane,</b> <b>EtOAc,</b> BuOH, and water fractions. Among all the fractions, EtOAc fraction showed the best suppressive effect on B 16 F 10 melanoma cell proliferation by CCK- 8 assay. It also showed the increased cell death and the changed cellular morphology after CBR treatment. Annexin V-FITC/PI, flow cytometry, and western blotting were performed to elucidate anticancer activity of CBR. The results showed that CBR induced p 53 -mediated apoptotic cell death of B 16 F 10. CBR EtOAc treatment increased melanin content and melanogenesis-related proteins of MITF and TRP- 1 expressions, which supports its anticancer activity. Its potential as an anticancer agent was further investigated in tumor-xenografted mouse model. In melanoma-xenografted mouse model, melanoma tumor growth was significantly suppressed under CBR EtOAc fraction treatment. HPLC analysis of CBR extract showed peak of adenosine. In conclusion, CBR extracts notably inhibited B 16 F 10 melanoma cell proliferation through the p 53 -mediated apoptosis induction and increased melanogenesis. These findings suggest that CBR EtOAc fraction can act as an effective anticancer agent to treat melanoma...|$|E

40|$|The radioprotective {{activity}} of extracts {{from the red}} seaweed Callophyllis (C.) japonica was investigated in mice that underwent whole-body exposure to gamma radiation. A methanol extract of C. japonica and its fractions [hexane, ethyl acetate (EtOAc), butanol and the remaining H 2 O] were used. Each fraction (100 mg/kg body weight) was administered intraperitoneally (i. p.) 2 times into the BALB/c mice, once at 1 and once at 24 h before exposure to 9 Gray (Gy) of gamma radiation. Pre-irradiation administration of the <b>hexane</b> and <b>EtOAc</b> fractions saved the mice, with their survival rates being greater than 80 % at 30 days post-irradiation; the mice that were pretreated with the other fractions showed survival rates lower than 20 % over the same time period. To {{examine the effect of}} each C. japonica fraction on the survival of intestinal and bone marrow stem cells, the number of intestinal crypts and bone marrow cells in the gamma-irradiated mice were examined. Pre-treatment of mice (i. p., 100 mg/kg body weight at 1 and 24 h before irradiation) with the <b>hexane</b> or <b>EtOAc</b> fraction prior to 6 -Gy irradiation significantly protected the number of jejunal crypts and bone marrow cells at 9 days after irradiation. These findings suggest that certain extracts from C. japonica, when they are administered prior to irradiation, {{play an important role in}} the survival of irradiated mice, and this is possibly due to the extracts protecting the hematopoietic cells and intestinal stem cells against gamma irradiation...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} methyl jasmonate postharvest {{application}} on the antioxidant and antiinflammatory activity of strawberry fruits was evaluated. Results {{showed that the}} methyl jasmonate treated strawberry extract had higher antioxidant activity and suppresses the nitrite production in LPS-stimulated RAW 264. 7 murine macrophages. The HPLC profiles of both treated and untreated strawberry extracts were compared. To evaluate which compounds are responsible of these higher activities it was also investigated the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacities of the <b>hexane,</b> chloroform, <b>EtOAc,</b> and n-butanol fractions obtained from the methyl jasmonate treated strawberry. The EtOAc and n-butanol fractions exhibited the most potent antioxidant activity compared to the hexane and chloroform fractions. In addition the n-butanol fraction was able to decrease nitrite production. The EtOAc and n-butanol fractions were analyzed by LC–MS. These results showed that methyl jasmonate promotes antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacity of strawberry fruits by the stimulation of phenolic compounds and anthocyanins production.

40|$|Objective: The {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate the antioxidant and hepatoprotective activities of the 80 % methanolic extract as well as the ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and butanol (BuOH) fractions of the wild fennel (Foeniculum vulgare (Subsp; Piperitum)) and cultivated fennel (F. vulgare var. azoricum). In addition, quantification of the total phenolic content in the 80 % methanol extract of fennel wild and cultivated herbs is measured. Materials and Methods: An amount of 400 g of air dried powdered herb of wild and cultivated fennel were sonicated with aqueous methanol (80 %), successively extracted with <b>Hexane,</b> <b>EtOAc,</b> and n-BuOH. The EtOAc and n-BuOH were subjected to repeated column chromatography on silica gel and Sephadex LH- 20. The antioxidant effect was determined in vitro using 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH·). Hepatoprotective activity was carried out using a Wistar male rat (250 - 300 g). Total phenolic and flavonoid contents were determined as chlorogenic acid and rutin equivalents, respectively. Results: Two phenolic compounds, i. e., 3, 4 -dihydroxy-phenethylalchohol- 6 -O-caffeoyl-β-d-glucopyranoside and 3 ?, 8 ?-binaringenin were isolated from the fennel wild herb, their structures were elucidated by spectral methods including 1 D NMR, 2 D NMR, and UV. The EtOAc and BuOH fractions of wild fennel were found to exhibit a radical scavenging activity higher than those of cultivated fennel. An in vitro method of rat hepatocytes monolayer culture was used for the investigation of hepatotoxic effects of the 80 % methanol extract on the wild and cultivated fennel, which were > 1000 and 1000 ΅g/mL, respectively. As well as, their hepatoprotective effect against the toxic effect of paracetamol (25 mM) was exerted at 12. 5 ΅g/mL concentration. Conclusions: Fennel (F. Vulgare) is a widespread plant species commonly used as a spice and flavoring. The results obtained in this study indicated that the fennel (F. vulgare) herb is a potential source of natural antioxidant. Two phenolic compounds, i. e. 3, 4 -dihydroxy-phenethylalchohol- 6 -O-caffeoyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (A) and 3 ?, 8 ?-binaringenin (B) were isolated from the fennel wild herb for the first time...|$|E
40|$|Phytochemical {{investigation}} on the methanolic extract of the stems and leaves of Malaysian Uncaria longiflora var. pteropoda (Miq.) Ridsd. {{was carried out}} {{with the aim of}} isolating and identifying their chemical constituents. The extract of the stems was subjected to acid-base extraction, while the leaf extract was successively triturated with <b>hexane,</b> CHCl 3, <b>EtOAc</b> and MeOH. The crude extracts were then further fractionated and purified using extensive chromatographic techniques. Structural elucidation of the phytochemicals was based on spectroscopic evidence and comparison with literature values. The absolute configurations of the new chiral compounds were established by comparing the CEs of the experimental ECD spectra to the simulated ECD values, {{as well as to the}} ECD spectra of the known related chiral compounds in hand. A total of thirtytwo phytochemicals were isolated of which six are new and nine are common to the leaves and stems. Phytochemicals isolated from the stem extract include two new pentacyclic oxindole alkaloids (POAs) deduced as rauniticine-allo-oxindole B ULS 1 and rauniticinicallo acid B ULS 2, five known POAs (isopteropodine ULS 3, pteropodine ULS 4, isopteropodic acid ULS 5, uncarine F ULS 6 and speciophylline ULS 7), two coumarins (scopoletin ULS 8 and 4 -hydroxy- 3, 7 - dimethoxycoumarin ULS 10), one phenyl compound (4 -hydroxybenzoic acid methyl ester ULS 9) and three terpenes (stigmasterol ULS 11, β-sitosterol ULS 12 and β-sitostenone ULS 13). Phytochemistry on the leaf extract successfully afforded three new alkaloids named as 2 -oxosecologanine ULL 5, isoformosaninol ULL 6 and formosaninol ULL 7, one new flavonoid deduced as uncariechin ULL 14, four known POAs (isopteropodine ULL 1, pteropodine ULL 2, uncarine F ULL 3 and isopteropodic acid ULL 4), two flavonoids [(-) -epi-afzalechin ULL 12 and (-) -epicatechin ULL 13], two coumarins (scopoletin ULL 8 and 3, 4 -dihydroxy- 7 -methoxycoumarin ULL 11), two phenyl compounds (4 -hydroxybenzoic acid methyl ester ULL 9 and 4 -hydroxy-benzaldehyde ULL 10) and five terpenes (β-tocopherol ULL 15, 6, 10, 14 -trimethyl- 2 -pentadecanone ULL 16, stigmasterol ULL 17, β-sitosterol ULL 18 and β-sitostenone ULL 19). Seven phytochemicals of sufficient quantities, comprising five alkaloids (isopteropodine, pteropodine, isopteropodic acid, uncarine F and rauniticine-allo-oxindole B) and two flavonoids [(-) -epi-afzalechin and (-) -epi-catechin] were further tested for their cytotoxic, neurotoxic, as well as neuroprotective activities against human neuroblastoma SH-SY 5 Y cell line. The alkaloid uncarine F was found to be both cytotoxic and neurotoxic against the cancer and normal human neuroblastoma SHSY 5 Y cell lines, while the alkaloid pteropodine was found to be neurotoxic, both at a high concentrations. As antioxidants, the flavan- 3 -ols, (-) -Epi-afzalechin and (-) -epi-catechin possessed neuroprotective properties against the H 2 O 2 -induced toxicity on normal cell line with cell viabilities ranging from 75 - 88 % compared to 50 - 60 % cell viability following treatment with H 2 O 2 alone. The alkaloids isopteropodine and isopteropodic acid, and the new alkaloid rauniticine-allo-oxindole B also consistently showed even higher protective properties with cell viabilities of 83 - 96 %, thus suggesting their potential as an anti-neurodegenerative agent. With respect to the cytotoxic, neurotoxic and neuroprotective activities of the pure compounds tested, it may be suggested that the toxic properties of both the stem and leaf extracts of the plant at the maximum concentration against the cancer and normal human neuroblastoma SH-SY 5 Y cell lines may be due to the alkaloid uncarine F, and not the synergistic effect among the constituents...|$|R
