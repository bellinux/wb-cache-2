5|$|The combat was {{generally}} well-received, with some reviewers noting {{that it is}} mostly unchanged from the original Knights of the Old Republic. GameSpot compared the combat from the first Knights of the Old Republic to the second, {{saying that it is}}n't well-balanced in both; however, the reviewer wrote that it helps the combat remain spontaneous. GameZone said that the combat is not changed from the first Knights of the Old Republic to the second, but that this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> since the combat in the original was enjoyable. IGN praised the game's AI, saying that it is easy to control the main character alone without controlling the party members. GameSpy's reviewer, on the other hand, said that he encountered problems with the combat AI that were not present in the original Knights of the Old Republic.|$|E

25|$|A {{liberalisation}} of import tariffs in 1797 {{marked the}} end of mercantilism and further liberalisation in the 19th {{and the beginning of the}} 20th century established the Danish liberal tradition in international trade that was only to be broken by the 1930s. Even when other countries, such as Germany and France, raised protection for their agricultural sector because of increased American competition resulting in much lower agricultural prices after 1870, Denmark retained its free trade policies, as the country profited from the cheap imports of cereals (used as feedstuffs for their cattle and pigs) and could increase their exports of butter and meat of which the prices were more stable. Today, Denmark is part of the European Union's internal market, which represents more than 508 million consumers. Several domestic commercial policies are determined by agreements among European Union (EU) members and by EU legislation. Support for free trade is high among the Danish public; in a 2007 poll 76% responded that globalisation <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing.</b> 70% of trade flows are inside the European Union. , Denmark's largest export partners are Germany, Sweden, the United Kingdom and Norway.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} two interpretations of Chen's actions during the {{election}} in terms of independence politics. The first {{is that he is}} ideologically committed to advancing Taiwan independence and that his actions are intended to systematically remove the constraints which prevent this from occurring. Seen in this light, his actions are intended to provoke a crisis in which the PRC must either start a war or accept independence, with the expectation that the PRC would back down. Ironically, this interpretation of his actions is shared both among his most fervent supporters (who think it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing)</b> and his most bitter opponents (who think that it is a bad thing). It is largely to counter this possibility that the PRC has issued statements that it will definitely go to war if certain red lines are crossed. However, they in reality carry little meaning, as Beijing has made such statements warning against electing former President Lee and Chen in the 1996 and 2000 elections, which both failed to materialize. Some people regard these statements now as reverse psychology, as Lee and Chen may help to weaken ROC and advance the unification process.|$|E

500|$|On February 3, 2005, it was {{announced}} that Enterprise had been cancelled. This news was passed to the cast and crew during the sixth day of production on [...] "In a Mirror, Darkly". The end of the series marked the first time in 18 years that no new Star Trek episodes were scheduled for broadcast, and Enterprise was the first live-action series of the franchise since The Original Series to last less than seven years. Braga said at a talk to students in Los Angeles shortly after the news of the cancellation was released that [...] "After 18 straight years on the air and 750-some episodes the current run of Star Trek is over.

500|$|Writing {{in retrospect}} for Daily Express, {{reviewer}} Simon Gage {{was critical of}} Minogue's lack of musical progression, charisma, and thought that she lacked a [...] "great voice". He stated [...] "There are dodgy tracks and the “voice”, more processed than a tinned pea, does start to grate but it’s still pretty good." [...] He awarded the box set three stars. British journalist Paul Du Noyer reviewed the box set, and complimented Minogue's Parlophone work as [...] "ambiguous pop". However, he stated [...] "There’s a lot of ambitious pop in here, but no conceptual overreach. Not even her experience of breast cancer was allowed to surface in Kylie’s subsequent material: lyrically, it was straight back to business. It seems unlikely such a 20-year lucky streak could be sustained {{without a lot of}} shrewd decisions by Minogue herself. So it seems that everyone is right after all: Kylie <b>is</b> <b>A</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Thing,</b> and here is just enough of it." ...|$|E

A fourth consecutive title followed a week later in the Legg Mason Tennis Classic in Washington, D.C., where he recorded a victory over Viktor Troicki, becoming the first player in ATP history to win his first four career titles in as many tournaments. [...] "I don't really understand what I did. It is difficult to believe that I have won four consecutive titles", del Potro said, crediting coach Franco Davín for his impressive run.

500|$|Vonnegut {{believed}} that ideas, and the convincing communication of those {{ideas to the}} reader, were vital to literary art. He did not always sugarcoat his points: much of Player Piano leads up to the moment when Paul, on trial and {{hooked up to a}} lie detector, is asked to tell a falsehood, and states, [...] "every new piece of scientific knowledge <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> for humanity". Robert T. Tally Jr., in his volume on Vonnegut's novels, wrote, [...] "rather than tearing down and destroying the icons of twentieth-century, middle-class American life, Vonnegut gently reveals their basic flimsiness." [...] Vonnegut did not simply propose utopian solutions to the ills of American society, but showed how such schemes would not allow ordinary people to live lives free from want and anxiety. [...] The large artificial families that the U.S. population is formed into in Slapstick soon serve as an excuse for tribalism, with people giving no help to those not part of their group, and with the extended family's place in the social hierarchy becoming vital.|$|E

We are meant to feel confused by his actions, and only time will tell how the show deals with this topic - will Dexter ever go too far, making us turn on our protagonist? There are so many questions that we have about this show, and that <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing.</b> Personally we cannot wait to see how long this game of cat-and-mouse goes on with the unknown serial killer and Dexter. With the solid introduction to the series, characters, and future storylines, we can't help but recommend Dexter to anybody that is at all curious about the show. [...] " [...] IGN reviewer Matt Fowler later placed Mike Donovan third on a list of [...] "Dexter's Top 10 Kills", saying [...] "We all remember our first. First car. First love. First staph infection. And when it comes to Dexter, first kill. No Mike Donovan, the church choir master, wasn't Dexter first dead body, but he was our televisual introduction into Dexter's wicked world of revenge and reckoning."

500|$|Comparing {{the video}} with works by Stevie Wonder, Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "compared to the {{over-the-top}} sensory overload of 'Countdown, ' the 'Love On Top' clip {{is very simple}} and straightforward, with the singer performing with backup singers and dancers in a spare room. Still, she changes wardrobe with every key change as the song reaches its euphoric climax." [...] Similarly, Leah Collins of Dose magazine wrote, [...] "New jack swing dance moves and costume changes are pretty much {{the focus of this}} one. [...] Still, Beyonce reveals a talent we never knew she had: the ability to switch costumes every time she switches keys. (This, it turns out, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing.</b> That pantsless African dictator look in the first scene? Maybe we're the only ones, but we're not really feeling Idi Amin-chic this season.)" [...] Georgette Cline of The Boombox found similarities between the video for [...] "Love On Top" [...] and the earlier videos that Beyoncé made with Destiny's Child while Sarah Anne Hughes of The Washington Post called the video fancy and an [...] "obvious homage to New Edition's 'If It Isn’t Love.'" [...] A more mixed review was given by Amanda Dobbins of New York magazine who wrote that [...] "The video will do nothing to silence Beyoncé plagiarism or baby bump conspiracy theorists; the first half borrows from an old New Edition video, and the entire thing was clearly filmed before her bump began to show." [...] However, she added, [...] "Still, Vulture salutes any artistic undertaking that requires a costume change with every key change." [...] The video was nominated in the category for Video of the Year at the 2012 BET Awards and in the category for Best Female Video at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards. It won Best Dance Performance at the 2012 Soul Train Music Awards.|$|E

500|$|Sigourney Weaver has {{expressed}} interest in reuniting with Ridley Scott to revive her character for another Alien film. In the 2003 commentary track for the Alien DVD included in the Alien Quadrilogy set, she and Scott both speculated on the possibility, with Weaver stating: [...] "There is an appetite for a fifth one, which is something I never expected...it's really hard {{to come up with}} a fifth story that's new and fresh...but I have wanted to go back into space...I think outer space adventure <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> for us right now, 'cause Earth is so grim...so we've been talking about it, but very generally." [...] Scott remarked that, if the series were to continue, the most logical course would be to explore the origins of the space jockey and the Aliens. Weaver supported this idea, saying [...] "I think it would be great to go back, because I'm asked that question so many times: 'Where did the Alien come from?' People really want to know in a very visceral way." [...] David Giler said that he, Walter Hill, and Gordon Carroll, the producers of the first four films in the series, would not be willing to produce another unless it was about the Aliens' homeworld and Weaver was on board (despite the fact that they were among the producers of Alien vs. Predator films). Weaver, in turn, indicated that she would only return to the franchise if either Scott or James Cameron were to direct. Cameron had been working on a story for a fifth Alien film which would explore the origins of the creatures, but ceased work on it when he learned that Fox was pursuing Alien vs. Predator, which he felt would [...] "kill the validity of the franchise".|$|E
500|$|Television critics reacted mostly mixed to [...] "Welcome Back, Carter", {{calling the}} storyline [...] "hit-or-miss." [...] In a {{simultaneous}} {{review of the}} episodes of The Simpsons and The Cleveland Show that preceded the show, and the broadcast of American Dad! that followed it, The A.V. Club's Rowan Kaiser noted the apparent lack of guest stars in the episode, adding, [...] "I can't help but feel [...] <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> in for Family Guy." [...] In the conclusion of his review Kaiser praised the [...] "shock humor" [...] in the limousine jousting scene, but compared Carter's catchphrases to [...] "the kind of groan-inducing meta-humor that [...] The Cleveland Show aims for." [...] He ultimately gave the episode a C rating, the second best rating of the night, beating The Cleveland Show episode [...] "How Cleveland Got His Groove Back" [...] and tying with the American Dad! episode [...] "Son of Stan". In a slightly more neutral review of the episode, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the episode's cutaways, stating that they [...] "came back with a vengeance this week." [...] Hughes went on to comment negatively on the scene involving Carter being woken up and hinting at incest with his daughter, noting, [...] "It's weird that while the pedophile character of Herbert doesn't bother me at all, this potential admission really does. Maybe because it adds an element of incest, or seemed more genuine than Herbert's over-the-top antics. But really, it's just another throwaway gag {{in the world of}} Seth MacFarlane." [...] Actor Jonathan Lipnicki, who was parodied in the episode, responded to his portrayal by stating, [...] "I don't feel bad about what they said on Family Guy. It was all in good fun, I've worked on that show [...]" ...|$|E
