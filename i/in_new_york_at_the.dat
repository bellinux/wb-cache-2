5|$|NY146 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> time, NY146 began at modern NY443 in Berne and followed what is now NY156 northeast to Altamont while modern NY146 west of Altamont was part of NY156. The alignments of the two routes were flipped in the late 1930s. Other minor realignments have occurred since, most notably near Mechanicville.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Greene {{served on}} court-martial duty {{for a year}} and then {{returned}} to civil engineering in New York and Washington, D.C. From 1867 to 1871 he was the chief engineer commissioner of the Croton Aqueduct Department <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> age of 86, he inspected the entire 30-mile Croton Aqueduct structure on foot.

5|$|NY28 was {{originally}} assigned in 1924 to an alignment extending from Colliersville {{in the south}} to Utica in the north via Ilion. From Colliersville to Cooperstown, the highway followed its current routing (excluding minor realignments); north of Cooperstown, NY28 was routed along several state highways that now have other designations. The route was extended south to Kingston and north to Warrensburg as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, NY28 was realigned between Cooperstown and Mohawk to follow its modern routing. Other than minor realignments in Kingston, Oneonta, and Oneida County, NY28 has remained the same to this day.|$|E
5|$|NY348 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> time, it began at NY22 in West Chazy and ended at US11 in the village of Champlain. NY348 had an overlap with US9 from Chazy to what is now NY9B in the town of Champlain. Here, US9 forked to the east and followed the length of modern NY9B to Rouses Point. NY348 was extended east to Rouses Point along US11 and what is now NY276 by the following year.|$|E

5|$|Rebecca Clarke (27 August 1886– 13 October 1979) was an English {{classical}} {{composer and}} violist {{best known for}} her chamber music featuring the viola. She was born in Harrow and studied at the Royal Academy of Music and Royal College of Music in London, later becoming one of the first female professional orchestral players. Stranded in the United States at the outbreak of World War II, she settled permanently in New York City and married composer and pianist James Friskin in 1944. Clarke died at her home <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> age of 93.|$|E
5|$|Route216 was {{originally}} part of NY39 in the 1920s. The portion of NY39 from Stormville to West Patterson was redesignated {{as part of}} NY52 in the 1930 renumbering of state highways <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, an alternate route of NY52 between Stormville and Towners was assigned the NY216 designation. The alignments of NY52 and NY216 between the two locations were largely swapped in 1937. In 1970, Route216 was truncated to its current eastern terminus in Poughquag.|$|E

5|$|What is now NY45 was {{originally}} designated NY305 {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, the portion of modern NY305 north of Portville in Cattaraugus and Allegany counties was assigned NY94, while the current NY94 in Orange County was designated NY45. The NY305 and NY94 designations were swapped in the early 1940s, placing NY305 on its current alignment and NY94 on what is now NY45. NY94 was then swapped again, this time for NY45, on January 1, 1949, placing both routes on their modern routings.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the portion}} {{of what is now}} NY370 from Cato to Liverpool was state-maintained by 1926, it {{remained}} unnumbered until the late 1920s. At that time, the section west of then-NY31 (now NY48) in Baldwinsville became NY37. The designation proved to be short-lived as it was renumbered to NY370 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, NY40 was split into several different routes. From Cato to just east of Red Creek, old NY40 became part of the new NY370, which also extended southeastward to NY57 in Liverpool. The small segment of former NY40 from NY3 to Upton Road was included in NY3E (later US104).|$|E
5|$|Following {{this decline}} in her career, Hepburn took action to create her own {{comeback}} vehicle. She left Hollywood {{to look for}} a stage project, and signed on to star in Philip Barry's new play, The Philadelphia Story. It was tailored to showcase the actress, with the character of socialite Tracy Lord incorporating a mixture of humor, aggression, nervousness, and vulnerability. Howard Hughes, Hepburn's partner at the time, sensed that the play could be her ticket back to Hollywood stardom and bought her the film rights before it even debuted on stage. The Philadelphia Story first toured the United States, to positive reviews, and then opened <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Schubert Theatre on March 28, 1939. It was a big hit, critically and financially, running for 417 performances and then going on a second successful tour.|$|E

5|$|In 1844, Isabella fell ill. She recovered, but {{the illness}} recurred the {{following}} year, {{and she became}} an invalid. John Macdonald took his wife to Savannah, Georgia, in the United States in 1845, hoping that the sea air and warmth would cure her ailments. Although John Macdonald was {{able to return to}} Canada after six months, Isabella remained in the United States for three years. He visited her again <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of 1846, and returned several months later when she informed him she was pregnant. In August 1847 their son John Alexander Macdonald Jr. was born in New York, but as Isabella remained ill, relatives cared for the infant.|$|E
5|$|NY78 was {{replaced}} by NY44 (now NY414) {{in the vicinity of}} Watkins Glen as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, two parts of the pre-1921 routing of Route46 east of Seneca Lake were assigned posted route numbers for the first time. From just northeast of Watkins Glen to Reynoldsville, the old road became part of NY227, which initially extended from NY44 (now NY414) near Watkins Glen to NY79 in Perry City. While Route46 veered southeast from Reynoldsville to serve Mecklenburg, NY227 proceeded northeast from the former to connect to Perry City. The portion of old Route46 north of Perry City became part of NY79.|$|E
5|$|Tubman {{was busy}} during this time, giving talks to {{abolitionist}} audiences and tending to her relatives. In {{the autumn of}} 1859, as Brown and his men prepared to launch the attack, Tubman could not be contacted. When the raid on Harpers Ferry took place on October 16, Tubman was not present. Some historians believe she was <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, ill with fever related to her childhood head injury. Others propose {{she may have been}} recruiting more escaped slaves in Ontario, and Kate Clifford Larson suggests she may have been in Maryland, recruiting for Brown's raid or attempting to rescue more family members. Larson also notes that Tubman may have begun sharing Frederick Douglass's doubts about the viability of the plan.|$|E

5|$|When the East India Company {{was taken}} over by the Crown in 1858, the tiger was stored in Fife House, Whitehall until 1868, when it moved down the road to the new India Office, which {{occupied}} part of the building still used by today's Foreign and Commonwealth Office. In 1874 it was moved to the India Museum in South Kensington, which was in 1879 dissolved, with the collection distributed between other museums; the V records the tiger as acquired in 1880. During World War II the tiger was badly damaged by a German bomb which brought down the roof above it, breaking the wooden casing into several hundred pieces, which were carefully pieced together after the war, so that by 1947 it was back on display. In 1955 it was exhibited <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Museum of Modern Art through the summer and spring.|$|E
5|$|In early 1976, Brynner {{received}} {{an offer from}} impresarios Lee Gruber and Shelly Gross to star, in the role that he had created 25 years before, in a U.S. national tour and Broadway revival. The tour opened in Los Angeles on July 26, 1976, with Constance Towers reprising the role of Anna. On opening night, Brynner suffered so badly from laryngitis that he lip-synched, with his son Rock singing and speaking the role from the orchestra pit. The production traveled across the United States, selling out every city it appeared in and finally opening <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Uris Theatre (today the Gershwin Theatre) on May 2, 1977. The production featured Martin Vidnovic as Lun Tha, and Susan Kikuchi danced the part of Eliza, recreating the role that her mother, Yuriko, had originated. Yuriko both directed the production and recreated the Robbins choreography. Sharaff again designed costumes, and Michael Kermoyan reprised {{the role of the}} Kralahome, while June Angela was Tuptim. The run lasted 696performances, almost two years, during which each of the stars took off three weeks, with Angela Lansbury replacing Towers and Kermoyan replacing Brynner. The production was nominated for the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Musical.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} {{numerous}} theatrical triumphs, Mahler's Vienna years were rarely smooth; his battles with singers {{and the house}} administration continued {{on and off for}} the whole of his tenure. While Mahler's methods improved standards, his histrionic and dictatorial conducting style was resented by orchestra members and singers alike. In December 1903 Mahler faced a revolt by stagehands, whose demands for better conditions he rejected in the belief that extremists were manipulating his staff. The anti-Semitic elements in Viennese society, long opposed to Mahler's appointment, continued to attack him relentlessly, and in 1907 instituted a press campaign designed to drive him out. By that time he was at odds with the opera house's administration over the amount of time he was spending on his own music, and was preparing to leave. In May 1907 he began discussions with Heinrich Conried, director of the New York Metropolitan Opera, and on 21 June signed a contract, on very favourable terms, for four seasons' conducting <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> end of the summer he submitted his resignation to the Hofoper, and on 15 October 1907 conducted Fidelio, his 645th and final performance there. During his ten years in Vienna, Mahler had brought new life to the opera house and cleared its debts, but had won few friends—it was said that he treated his musicians in the way a lion tamer treated his animals. His departing message to the company, which he pinned to a notice board, was later torn down and scattered over the floor. After conducting the Hofoper orchestra in a farewell concert performance of his Second Symphony on 24 November, Mahler left Vienna for New York in early December.|$|E
