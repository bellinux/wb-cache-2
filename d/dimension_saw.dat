40|$|The New Deal for Communities (NDC) {{programme}} {{was one of}} {{the most}} intensive area-based initiatives (ABIs) ever launched in England. Between 1998 and 2010, 39 NDC partnerships were charged with implementing 10 -year, locally informed strategies designed to improve conditions within deprived neighbourhoods each accommodating around 9, 800 people. More than any other previous English ABI, the NDC programme placed a strong emphasis on informing and engaging the 39 local communities in all aspects of the regeneration process. The programme can be seen as a laboratory within which to assess relationships between community involvement in regeneration and any associated outcomes. Change data indicates that at the area-level there is nothing to suggest NDC areas saw more change than other deprived localities, or that NDCs doing more in relation to the community <b>dimension</b> <b>saw</b> greater change than those doing less. Data showing change for individuals, however, reveals that those involved in NDC activities saw more gains than those who were not involved. This positive individual-level change is not reflected in area-level data because absolute levels of involvement remained essentially low. This was for a number of reasons, some of which relate to the evolving NDC narrative: greater control from central government, diminishing community interest in the initiative, and over-optimistic assumptions on the part of local residents as to what the programme could ever achieve...|$|E

30|$|The high {{accuracy}} of log positioning and {{the stability of}} saw blades in breakdown machinery in modern sawmills have reduced the need to add margins for sawing variations. Oversize green <b>sawing</b> <b>dimensions</b> are still needed, but mainly to allow for drying shrinkage. This has put a new focus on better adapting green <b>sawing</b> <b>dimensions</b> to the shrinkage behavior of wood. In this study, a method for optimization of green <b>sawing</b> <b>dimensions</b> using stochastic simulation is presented. Normal distributions were generated for planed dry dimensions, kerf width, and target moisture content. The minimum share of boards exceeding the specified dry dimensions was decided, and deformations in boards from all positions in the cross section {{in a number of}} logs were simulated. The simulated shrinkage allowance from stochastic simulations was compared to experimental results from an industry test and to finite element results based on material data for Norway spruce. The results showed that the green width of the sawn boards should increase when the number of boards in the center yield increases. The green thickness of boards should be thinner for center boards and outer boards than for inner boards.|$|R

40|$|Although CNC marble saw {{machines}} can automatically cut marble slabs {{to desired}} <b>dimensions,</b> <b>saw</b> speed and feed rate are selected by operator according to stone parameters, {{features of the}} saw, and its immersion depth. If the feed rate is selected lower than the optimal value, there will be time-loss and capacity deficiencies {{or if it is}} selected faster, cutting quality will decrease, spindle motor will draw more current, and saw blade will corrode faster. While cutting especially thick materials, saw may be stacked in the stone, cutting quality may be impaired, saw blade may be abraded earlier, precision quality may go down because of increase in measurement errors, and machine may be damaged with the increase in vibrations when improper feed rates are selected. Because of nonhomogeneity of the slabs and deterioration of the saw blade, operator cannot determine a persistent feed rate. This study is targeted to find saw speeds according to saw diameter and optimum feed rate by means of limiting vibrations and current drawn from saw motor and torque accordingly in order to increase working performance of CNC marble saw machines. Thanks to adaptive adjustment of feed rate, one can save on material as well as time, labour, and cost by making use of optimum energy...|$|R

40|$|The two {{principal}} challenges in processing many eucalypts are the distortion/warping of timeber during sawing {{and the subsequent}} difficulties in drying the timber without significant degrade. Incorporating wood quality traits associated with these challenges in breeding {{is considered to be}} a demanding task. In this paper, simple approaches for mass screening for growth stresses, shrinkage, collapse and drying rates have been proposed. Sawing of log or stem along the length through the pith and measuring the outward bending of two half rounds form a quick and reliable method for screening trees with low growth stress. A mathematical model was developed that relates the longitudinal growth stress and bending in half round. Methods for assessment of shrinkage avoiding preparation of precise sized specimens and initial measurements, drying rates from small <b>dimension</b> quarter <b>sawn</b> board, drying deformations using discs have been proposed...|$|R

30|$|The length, width, thickness, {{percentage}} of visible rot, {{percentage of}} heartwood, size, location and condition of knots (live, dead, rotten), number of resin pockets and clear-cuttings dimensions were measured and recorded for each board. All timber from the pruned logs was reconstructed into the logs and {{the locations of}} defects (i.e. length along the board, knot depth and occlusion depth) noted. The {{presence or absence of}} heartwood was recorded at 0.5 m intervals along the board.

40|$|Issues {{of scale}} {{play a crucial}} role in the {{governance}} of social&# 8211;ecological systems. Yet, attempts to bridge interdisciplinary perspectives on the role of scale have thus far largely been limited to the science arena. This study has extended the scale vocabulary to allow for the inclusion of practice-based perspectives on scale. We introduced &# 8220;dimensions,&# 8221; used to describe the bare aspects of phenomena, such as time, space, and power, structured by scales and levels. We argued that this extension allows for a clearer understanding of the diversity of dimensions and scales that can be used to explore social&# 8211;ecological systems. We used this scale vocabulary in a practical case study to elicit perspectives on dimensions, scales, and cross-dimensional dynamics from change agents in Dutch social&# 8211;ecological systems. Through a visual interview method based in the extended scale vocabulary, our participants identified a large diversity of <b>dimensions</b> they <b>saw</b> as instrumental to understanding insights and lessons about effecting systems change. These dimensions were framed by a large number of scales to describe cross-dimensional interactions. The results illustrate the value of practice-based perspectives for the development of scale theory. We also argue that the introduction of dimensions in the scale vocabulary is useful for clarifying scale theory aimed at linking different disciplines and sectors, and that the framework and methods based on it can also provide clarity for practical scale challenges...|$|R

According to Peters, who had lost 50-70 lbs with her diet regimen, dieting meant being beautiful and being in total control of the self. Being thin, to Peters, was an issue of self-esteem as well as physical health.

40|$|An {{industrial}} laser light scattering scanner, designed {{to detect the}} spiral grain angle of logs by the light scattering along the grain, was used on two large samples of Norway spruce (Picea abies (var. Karst)) in various <b>sawn</b> <b>dimensions</b> (approximately 750 pieces). Additional measurements were made by other techniques, such as X-ray scanning, resonance frequency measurement, and various manual measurements. The strength properties of the boards were measured by destructive testing in four-point bending according to European standard. Multivariate methods (PLS) were used to model {{the relationship between the}} bending strength of the board (MOR) and the measurements. Based only on the output from the simple tracheid scattering equipment, a model for MOR achieved an R² exceeding 0. 3. Combinations with average density or outer shape parameters from log scanning resulted in R² 0. 4 and 0. 3 respectively, although these parameters alone only accounted for R² 0. 2.

The other study was conducted at the USDA Forest Service, Forest Products Laboratory, Madison, Wisconsin, in small experimental kilns with lumber from trees harvested in central Idaho. The three main variables in the studies were top loading, presteaming, and a high-temperature kiln schedule. A limited study of hot press drying was also included. The high-temperature kiln schedule in the experimental kilns reduced drying time to about half that of the conventional temperature schedule. Press drying time was slightly more than 3 h. Crook and bow caused most of the warp and the grade loss from warp. There {{was no evidence that}} presteaming affected warp or grade loss from warp. Top loading had a modest effect in reducing warp and grade loss from warp. High-temperature drying did not affect measured warp compared with the conventional temperature schedule. Grade loss from warp was less in high-temperature than in conventional temperature dried lumber. This might be explained by differences in moisture content change during storage. Press drying did not reduce warp or grade loss from warp. Keywords: kiln drying, warp, ponderosa pine, smalldiameter timber August 2001 Simpson, William T.; Green, David W. 2001.

(This study was carried out at Bodija plank market in Ibadan to assess the technical efficiency of sawn timber produced from timber flitching and also to assess) assess and it expressed the general assessment of processing (the waste in timber flitching. Data were collected on all the species commonly flitched and their various dimensions were equally measured. The waste arising from conservation errors in timber flitching determined by comparing the conventional <b>dimensions</b> of <b>sawn</b> wood with the series of variation discovered in the dimension flitched wood. From the result, 13 different species, which are the most prominent flitched logs in the market, were randomly selected and measurements were taken on individual species. This was represented in the table 2 (Species A – M) and 10 planks were selected and dimensional measurement i. e. length, breadth and thickness were taken and recorded. Four species A, G, H and J with mean volume of 58788. 76 cm 3, 62168. 83 cm 3, 50609. 61 cm 3 and 62377. 77 cm 3 respectively were discovered to have different variations from the conventional volume of 56633. 69 cm 3. Also, nine different lumber species were considered under the conventional dimension of 28316. 85 cm 3 (i. e. 5. 08 cm x 15. 24 cm x 365. 76 cm).

60|$|So I saw, but I {{could not}} speak or yell. All was intense {{excitement}} on that boat. I jumped up on the stern, holding the bait Captain Dan had put on my hook. Then I paused to look.

I had no calm judgment with which to measure his <b>dimensions.</b> I only <b>saw</b> that he was tremendous and beautiful. His great, yard-wide fins gleamed royal purple.

I thought of my brother Reddy--how he would have gloried in that sight! I thought of Dilg, of Bob Davis, of Professor Kellogg--other great fishermen, all in a flash. Indeed, though I gloated over my fortune, I was not selfish. Then I threw in the flying-fish bait. The swordfish loomed up, while my heart ceased to beat.

I first saw them on a Saturday evening, and, perceiving from their occupation that Saturday evening was their trysting-time, I returned that evening se'nnight, and renewed the contemplation of them. They came there to shake the bits of matting which were spread in the church aisles, and they afterwards rolled them up, he rolling his end, she rolling hers, until they met, and over the two once divided now united rolls--sweet emblem!--gave and received a chaste salute. It was so refreshing to find one of my faded churchyards blooming into flower thus, that I returned a second time, and a third, and ultimately this befell:- They had left the church door open, in their dusting and arranging. Walking in to look at the church, I became aware, by the dim light, of him in the pulpit, of her in the reading-desk, of him looking down, of her looking up, exchanging tender discourse. Immediately both dived, and became as it were non-existent on this sphere. With an assumption of innocence I turned to leave the sacred edifice, when an obese form stood in the portal, puffily demanding Joseph, or in default of Joseph, Celia. Taking this monster by the sleeve, and luring him forth on pretence of showing him whom he sought, I gave time for the emergence of Joseph and Celia, who presently came towards us in the churchyard, bending under dusty matting, a picture of thriving and unconscious industry. It would be superfluous to hint that I have ever since deemed this the proudest passage in my life.|$|R

40|$|In Scandinavia, sawlogs are {{typically}} sorted upon {{arrival at the}} sawmill. Presorting of sawlogs according to dimension, e. g., using an optical three-dimensional (3 D) scanner, is {{used to make the}} sawing process more efficient. However, since wood is a biological material with large variability, there will be large differences in the quality of wood sawn from different logs of similar size. For some <b>dimensions</b> of <b>sawn</b> goods, wood quality is very important and low grade products will be difficult to sell, while for other dimensions, grade is less important. This means that if the quality of the sawn goods may be predicted before actual sawing takes place, the production of off-grade products, i. e., products not meeting customer demands, may be reduced. Some quality information may be obtained using the outer shape information from a 3 D scanner and more detailed information on the internal quality of the log can be obtained using an X-ray log scanner. Today, the use of X-ray log scanners is becoming increasingly common and most sawmills installing an X-ray scanner already have a 3 D scanner present. This raises the question of possible benefits from combining the X-ray and 3 D scanning techniques. In this thesis, a method has been developed where the log shape measured by the 3 D scanner is utilized to estimate the X-ray path lengths through the wood. This allows the calculation of green density profiles of the log, which may in turn be used to calculate quality variables such as heartwood content and heartwood density. The hypothesis of this project has been that the precision in these variables will be improved by the 3 D path length compensation of the X-ray data. The method has been tested on Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) sawlogs, using both simulated and industrial log scanner data. Scanners with one and two X-ray directions have been used. The most important conclusions from the project are that: - Heartwood diameter predictions are significantly improved by the combination of 3 D and X-ray data. - Dry and green heartwood densities can be calculated with improved precision relative to scanning using X-ray only. - The method was found suitable for application with both one- and two-directional X-ray scanners. - For a sawmill already using both 3 D and X-ray scanners, there is a large improvement potential available using existing equipment. For sawmills thinking about investing in an X-ray scanner, the possibility of connecting it to the 3 D scanner should make the rate of return of the equipment higher and encourage more sawmills to make this investment.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} was conducted with the view of obtaining baseline information {{on the use of}} polyethylene glycol (PEG) on Tasmanian Oak for the purpose of improving the quality of the seasoned structural timber product. Tasmanian Oak is the marketing name for a triad of Tasmanian-grown eucalypt species (E. delegatensis, E. obliqua, and E. regnans). Incubation of freshly-milled timber in aqueous PEG solutions prior to seasoning follows on from investigations in northern hemispheric timber species such as hoop pine and spruce {{in the middle of the}} 20 th Century. PEG penetrates freshly sawn Tasmanian Oak in a manner which is considerate of incubation time, temperature, PEG molecular weight/size and timber density. Histological examination indicated that PEG penetrated completely throughout the structure of the wood substance in three orientations (transverse, radial and tangential). During air-drying of PEG soaked timber, further migration of PEG into Tasmanian Oak is negligible. The rate of moisture content loss in Tasmanian Oak was shown to be retarded by PEG pre-treatment although the ability to prevent moisture loss was not concomitant with dimensional stability. An investigation to explain the change in rate of moisture loss examined effects on the thermodynamic property, water activity. Results indicated that a change in solution water activity could partly expain changes in the rate of moisture content loss, but more research is required to better divine this relationship. Shrinkage in Tasmanian Oak was reduced after treatment with aqueous PEG 400 solutions at or above 30 % (v/v), with a greater percentage reduction in tangential shrinkage compared to reduction in radial shrinkage. This is significant as backsawn (a. k. a. flatsawn) timber, with its broader tangential face, was in particular focus. The reduction in shrinkage was consistent with PEG concentration in the incubating medium. A decrease in the formation of drying defect, such as surface and internal checking accompanied the improvement in keeping <b>sawn</b> <b>dimensions.</b> Backsawn Tasmanian Oak obtained from young trees (less than 20 years) from plantation resource presents a challenging profile for commercial timber drying and will become more prevalent as the logging of old-growth forests is phased out. Timber seasoners may be faced with options of longer drying times or lower yields due to drying defect unless a method can be developed to provide added protection to the sawn timber product during drying. At this stage, pre-treatment of Tasmanian Oak with PEG shows the hallmarks of providing a solution to this emerging dilemma...|$|R
