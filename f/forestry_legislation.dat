40|$|Decentralized {{governance}} of biological resources {{has become a}} widely accepted standard of multilateral and bilateral aid programmes. Recent environmental and <b>forestry</b> <b>legislations</b> {{in many of the}} developing countries hosting significant biodiversity provide for the establishment of community forests. Participatory institutional arrangements at the local level are expected to be more efficient than centralized management regimes in dealing with environmental externalities. Following a reversal of forest policy in 1997, the management of State owned forests in Madagascar can now be delegated by contract to village communities. The policy aims at negotiating on a case by case basis a new legal status of forests. Negotiations are being conducted through a specific procedure of environmental mediation. But {{there is a lack of}} institutional demand to deal with environmental externalities. Due to legal pluralism, peasants are generally not in conflict with administrative agents. In many cases, potential contracting parties of management transfer already cooperate through parallel networks which result in unsustainable management. Because they are disempowered to challenge the working rules of these networks, forest users refuse official environmental mediation. Collective bargaining thu...|$|R

40|$|Ethiopia is, in {{the last}} two decades, taking some legal and policy {{positive}} measures to improve the old long lasting poor land administration system. Land registration and certification is being implemented in the country though in quite varying scale and quality. However, there are several major gaps in the existing sustainable land management practices. The responsible organ for the implementation of the land administration laws at national level is the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MOARD). There is one unit called Watershed Management Team under the Natural Resources Conservation and Management Directorate of this Ministry which follows up and monitors all aspects of land administration development throughout the country. As it stands now, this structure does not give the required degree of autonomy and capacity to the land administration system in the country in the rural and urban areas. In the regions, this structure is being followed almost in all regions where the system is introduced. There are various types of legislations regulating real property in the country. These include real property registration rules, lease laws, planning and building laws, and environmental and <b>forestry</b> <b>legislations</b> though some important matters such as real property formation, utilit...|$|R
50|$|During {{the early}} years of its existence, the AFA relied on annual reports, {{occasional}} bulletins, and the general press for the publication of information about forestry. In 1897 it was incorporated, and it took over from the New Jersey Forestry Association the publication of the periodical The Forester, changing the title later to Forestry and Irrigation, Conservation, and, finally, American Forests. By 1920, the AFA had about 10,000 members, and was very active and influential in educating public sentiment and in shaping <b>forestry</b> <b>legislation.</b>|$|E

50|$|A {{large portion}} of <b>forestry</b> <b>legislation</b> focuses on {{administrative}} requirements, fees, taxes, and property rights, rather than on how forests are really managed. Of particular importance to forestry is that, even where governments or colonial powers {{have been willing to}} recognize individual claims, based on custom or usage, to land used for agriculture or housing, they have generally ignored traditional-group rights to areas used in common, such as forest or pasture. By treating such land as “empty” during the process of settling rights, governments around the world have vested in the state ownership of vast expanses of forest land.|$|E

The benefits of investment in farm <b>forestry,</b> and <b>legislation</b> affecting its utilisation, are considered. Mechanisms which enable farm forestry to be utilised in farm succession are identified and discussed, with examples given. By examining the above points this report shows that when farm forestry is combined with the various mechanisms available, effective planning, and good timing, it is an effective tool in the intergeneration transfer of family-farm assets...|$|R
50|$|Since {{the early}} 1990s, a strong impetus {{has been created}} to focus on conserving Canada's boreal legacy and {{sustainably}} managing economic activity within the entire region. The Canadian boreal is largely intact and available for multiple uses like timber harvest, recreation and hunting. Forestry companies have come to adopt the management practices known as eco-system based management, which takes into consideration criteria and indicators for sustainability - social, economic and environmental. A number of key principles have come to underpin Canadian forestry practices as mandated by <b>forestry</b> <b>legislation,</b> including the obligation for forestry companies operating on public lands to fully regenerate all areas harvested for timber and to consult the public on the preparation of forest management/harvest plans submitted to the relevant provincial authorities.|$|E
5000|$|Towards {{the end of}} October, 2010, {{newspaper}} reports emerged, claiming that the Government was planning to sell off public forests in England. Following discussions with Dean Forest Voice, Baroness Royall and other individuals, Forest of Dean newspaper, The Forester, responded by announcing {{the formation of a}} 'Hands off our Forest' campaign.The reports were confirmed in late October, when the Minister for Agriculture and Food, James Paice MP, wrote to MPs to explain the Government's reasons for including powers to modernise <b>forestry</b> <b>legislation</b> in the Public Bodies Bill, which had recently been introduced to Parliament. His letter confirmed the Government was [...] "exploring new ownership" [...] options for forestry land currently managed by the Forestry Commission; which include large areas of the Forest of Dean.|$|E
50|$|Law {{enforcement}} has {{an essential}} role, {{but because of}} the complex nature of the forest itself it is really the last resort for obtaining compliance with the law. Where illegal logging, for example, is tied up with conflicting views of forest tenure, using the criminal law to resolve land disputes has obvious limitations.There are at least three approaches to overcoming the difficulties of proving offenses that have taken place in remote locations. One is to focus enforcement on more visible acts, such as transport. Another, common in civil law, is to make the official report of a sworn official admissible as evidence in further proceedings. This effectively shifts the burden of proof to the defendant. A third device is the use of evidentiary presumptions, which similarly shifts the burden of proof to the defendant.In many countries the contrast between what forestry law prescribes and what actually happens on the ground is both stark and obvious. Even where the law is strong, illegal behavior by both public and private actors often thrives. The explanations put forward for this phenomenon are familiar: forest departments lack the financial and human resources to monitor and control forest activities, which often take place in very remote areas; government officials entrusted with enforcing the law may be under immense pressure to condone violations, or engage in violations themselves; court systems are backlogged or bankrupt; the difficulties of daily life for the rural poor may overwhelm any likely risks associated with violating the law; etc.These explanations underscore the point that while good <b>forestry</b> <b>legislation</b> is necessary, it is obviously not sufficient. The laws in many countries lie unused or underused for reasons like failure of political will, weak institutions, or even general disregard for the rule of law.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{debates about}} governance, poverty and {{environmental}} sustainability have emphasized a ‘rights-based’ approach to development, in which {{individual rights and}} freedoms are strongly associated with fair and equitable development. Such approaches are defended {{both in terms of}} the ‘intrinsic’ benefits of basic human rights and the ‘instrumental’ benefits these may provide. However, the process of implementing a rights-based approach entails a number of political costs. Principal among these are the costs of ensuring that social rights are effectively enforced and the related cost of encouraging the state to intervene on behalf of poor and vulnerable groups in society. Reflecting upon these themes, this paper explores the case of Thailand’s ‘Community <b>Forestry</b> Bill’, <b>legislation</b> that was introduced to support rights of access and environmental conservation for communities living in forest reserve areas. Examining watershed forests in the north and mangrove conservation in the south, it argues that efforts to support rural livelihoods through the establishment of community rights have been undermined by powerful private actors and by a state that has generally ruled in favour of commercial interests. The article then documents the creative ways in which civil society organizations have been able to negotiate and secure informal rights of access in rural areas. Such findings, it concludes, illustrate the need to situate rights-based approaches within the wider public spheres in which rules, rights, and ‘community’ are established, and defended...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of the forestry sector {{in the last two}} decades in Romania has been significantly influenced by the post 1989 political and economic changes, forest restitution and the European Union accession process. Based on the analysis of <b>forestry</b> statistics, <b>legislation</b> and institutional changes this paper underlines the main developments in the forestry sector in the last twenty years and the linkages with other sectors that had an impact on its development. The significant change in forest ownership (based on which 45 % of the Romanian forest is nowadays in non-state hands), the unprecedented re-organisation of the forest sector through the institutional separation of the regulatory, control and forest management functions, the changes in forest administration (including the establishment of more than 110 private forest districts) and the full privatisation of the wood harvesting and processing sector complemented by foreign investments have shaped the forest sector development in a context in which the forest resource remained almost unchanged. Major developments have been recorded in the establishment and management of large protected areas as National Forest Administration Romsilva is currently administrating 22 national and nature parks. Both positive and negative interactions of forestry with environmental protection, wood processing, agriculture, rural development, road infrastructure and tourism sectors have also impacted the {{evolution of}} the forest sector. Development policy options recommended by authors include among others the strengthening of the public authority responsible for forestry, reorganisation of the state forest administration and supporting the access of forest owners to the national and EU funding and compensation schemes for forestry...|$|R

40|$|This article explores {{what the}} {{academic}} literature {{tells us about}} environmental conservation challenges in Myanmar, and what types of domestic and international mechanisms are suited to address those challenges. It begins by providing background information on rural energy use, environmental <b>legislation,</b> <b>forestry,</b> agriculture and the country's network of protected areas. It notes, for example, that the country's protected areas face environmental degradation caused by poverty, corruption, the expansion of agricultural land and population growth. It goes on to argue that planners in Myanmar can, however, utilize a variety of mechanisms to overcome these challenges. Policy-makers can enhance community involvement in protected areas and management schemes through ownership and engagement. They could integrate conservation efforts with income generation, provide education and awareness campaigns for those living near wildlife areas and expand the number and size of protected areas. They could, furthermore, increase penalties against illegal activities within protected areas, offer accelerated staff training and education programmes and similarly consolidate regulatory authority for environmental conservation. Even those outside of Myanmar can prevent environmental destruction. International planners could implement ecosystem payments schemes, involve Myanmar more concretely in the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) process, an international agreement launched in 2012, and expand Myanmar's participation in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. Lastly, they could advocate international bans on exports of illegal products and strengthen capacity building efforts {{in the areas of}} forestry, land use and agriculture...|$|R

As a consequence, <b>forestry</b> <b>legislation</b> is being modified (Anonym, 2012), now allowing forest landowners to use CCF without any specific justification.

30|$|All the {{hypotheses}} {{of the study}} were supported by the results. However, the effect of risk attitude on optimal management was very small, which {{may be related to the}} current <b>forestry</b> <b>legislation</b> which ruled out a part on the management options. Another reason may be the size differences of the species of mixed stands, which had a greater impact on the results than risk attitude. Positive correlation between timber prices of different tree species (Figure  3) also decreases the possibilities to reduce financial risk by increased species diversity. Roessiger et al. (2011) concluded that the optimal management for a cautious risk-avoiding forest landowner uses tree species diversification, avoiding clear-cutting and mono-species forest composition.|$|E

40|$|The humid forest zone of Cameroon {{is part of}} the {{biodiversity}} rich Congo Basin. Until the mid- 1990 s, the forests of Cameroon were centrally managed, which excluded communities from accessing forest resources and gaining economic benefits from them.

The new <b>forestry</b> <b>legislation</b> of 1994 – focusing on the devolution of management responsibilities to local communities – has reinforced this participatory trend.
