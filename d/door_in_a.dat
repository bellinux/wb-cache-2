25|$|Another halakhic {{disagreement}} between Rabbeinu Tam and Rashi concerns {{the placement of}} the mezuzah. Rashi rules that it should be mounted on the doorpost in a vertical position; Rabbeinu Tam holds that it should be mounted horizontally. In a compromise solution, many Ashkenazi Jews place the mezuzah on the <b>door</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> slanted position. Sephardi Jews mount the mezuzah vertically, per the opinions of Rashi, Maimonides, and the Shulchan Aruch.|$|E

Built initially as a music conservatoire in 1890, the site became a recording studio in 1926 for the Piccadilly label. In 1933, they became the Highbury (film) Studios and in 1945 they were acquired by the Rank Organisation. Due to economic difficulties, Rank closed the studios down and they were demolished in 1960. Athenaeum Court, a block of flats, now occupies the site.|$|E
25|$|The {{renovation}} {{and expansion}} of Proctor's Theatre in 2007 {{has been seen as}} the catalyst for the revival and renewed interest in Schenectady's downtown. The renovation cost $30 million and involved building two new theaters including an Iwerks screen, an expanded backstage area that allowed it to attract larger Broadway plays, and a power plant to produce electricity, heat, and air conditioning to the theater and sells excess to the surrounding properties. Prior to the renovation Proctor's had an annual attendance of 150,000 in 2004, five years later Proctor's attendance was 500,000 in 2009. The latest expansion is ongoing next <b>door</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> former 100-year-old bank building that had housed a Key Bank branch for the last 33 years. The bank lobby, which will be connected to the arcade at Proctor's will be used for events such as banquets and weddings and is named the Key Hall at Proctor's. At the end of the same block that houses Proctor's was built a movie theater, the Bow Tie Cinema, with office space above housing Siemens AG's Power Technologies International division (Siemens PTI).|$|E

500|$|The 2012 edition also {{included}} a ten-page story called [...] "The Door", which Brown redrew from an anonymous public domain story from a horror comic book. [...] In the story, a couple go through a <b>door</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> funhouse which leads through a passage in which they get lost for years. [...] Their clothes disintegrate over that time, exposing their genitals, until they finally come across another door—one that leads them to Hell. [...] Brown wrote he found the original story truly horrifying, as the couple had done nothing apparent to deserve their fate. [...] He had originally intended to incorporate it into the Ed story, but capriciously veered off in another narrative direction.|$|E

Harry's least favourite class is Potions, taught by Severus Snape, the vindictive Head of Slytherin {{who seems to}} loathe Harry. [...] Harry, Ron, and Hermione become far more interested by extracurricular matters {{within and outside the}} school, particularly after they discover that a huge three-headed dog is standing guard over a trap <b>door</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> forbidden corridor. They also become suspicious of Snape's behaviour and become convinced that he is looking for ways to get past the trapdoor to whatever it's hiding.|$|E

Elliot [...] "could not refrain from uttering a shout of horror, and rushed to the <b>door</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> manner the reverse of polite". The Pig-faced Lady rushed at Elliot as he left and bit him {{on the back of the}} neck; it was claimed that he was badly injured in the attack, requiring treatment by eminent surgeon Sir Cæsar Hawkins.

The Loose Fur album was not released at the time because Tweedy was busy recording Wilco's fourth album, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.|$|E
500|$|The film {{opens with}} an inter-title that reads [...] "Poor little rich girl has {{no one to}} play with" [...] and cuts to Baby Helen with her doll, looking out the window. A group of {{children}} play Ring a Ring o' Roses in the yard. Next, Baby Helen goes to tea party {{set up on the}} yard and holds her doll, all by herself, with a lonely expression. The neighbor's dog, Shep comes out of his dog house and barks, and Baby Helen rises with a joyful expression. She takes a piece of a muffin and tosses it through the boxwood hedge separating the two yards. Shep eats the muffin and Helen invites him to her tea party. Shep runs along the hedge and passes through to join her. Helen instructs Shep with her finger and Shep barks in understanding, Helen takes her seat and shares a muffin with Shep. An inter-title announces that a week later, Helen is out on an errand. Helen passes through the hedge and skips down the sidewalk and Shep barks at her. As Helen crosses the street, she is struck by a passing automobile and Shep races to the rescue. He tugs at her dress at the waist and finding that he is unable to move her, runs to Helen's home and jumps against the screen door, barking repeatedly. As Helen's parents are summoned, Shep leads them to Helen, where a passerby has scooped up Helen {{from the middle of the}} street. All three depart and the scene changes to a dimly lit room with Helen laid on a bed, seemingly dead. Her parents watch over her, with sad faces as a doctor inspects her and folds her arms across her chest. Beyond saving, her parents bury their heads in the pillow next to Helen as the doctor pens a note. Then Shep is shown resting against the side of the <b>door</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> feeble and sorrowful looking position.|$|E

The audience was seated in 360°, with “Lord’s” and “Gentlemen’s” rooms in the middle and upper galleries behind the stage.

2500|$|In [...] "The Christmas Invasion" [...] it {{was stated}} the {{regenerative}} cycle creates {{a large amount}} of residual regeneration energy that suffuses the Time Lord's body.

This is in keeping with earlier serials, such as Robot, where the newly regenerated Fourth Doctor splits a brick with his bare hand, and in the 1996 television movie, where the Doctor is depicted battering down a heavy steel <b>door</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hospital morgue.|$|E

2500|$|The oldest {{church in}} Denton is St. Lawrence's. It is almost 500 years old, {{originally}} built in 1531. It is a listed Grade II* building. The church {{is also known}} locally as [...] "Th'owd Peg" [...] (the old peg) due to the fact, as a timber-framed building, it was constructed with wooden pegs rather than nails. It is more {{commonly known as the}} black and white church, because of its appearance. A local myth is also said to have a pirate buried within its grounds because of a grave stone marked with a skull and crossbones at its front <b>door.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> more thorough investigation and article printed by Denton Local History Society (1995), {{it was found that the}} gravestone was actually a masonic gravestone belonging to a deceased Soldier named Samuel Bromley from the Royal Artillery.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tower is}} in {{perpendicular}} style, in three exterior visual stages separated by stringing. On different levels it has three interior floors {{consisting of the}} vestry and its loft at the bottom, then a clock chamber whose floor is roughly level with the nave ceiling, and a bell chamber on the top floor. The bottom and middle floor levels are indistinguishable from the outside, because the diagonal buttresses run up the bottom two stages {{and half of the}} top stage, and there is exterior stringing halfway up the bottom floor but not between the bottom and middle floors. However, stringing on the exterior identifies the floor level of the bell stage. The interior chambers of the tower appear tiny because of the space taken by the spiral staircase inside its south wall. The church's ribbed west <b>door,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> [...] "segmental-pointed" [...] arch with [...] "broad chamfer" [...] is in the lower exterior stage. The three-light window above is included in the exterior second stage with the spiral staircase windows and the blue clock faces. The three-light window is hidden in the interior, being inaccessible in the vestry loft. The third stage has double, uncusped, round-headed bell-openings on all four sides, and an embattled parapet. The tower is floodlit at night.|$|E
2500|$|The Field Guide, {{the first}} book in the series, was {{published}} in May 2003.

On the first night, they discover a secret library {{on the second floor}} using a dumbwaiter. They later discover that the library connects {{to the rest of the}} house via a hidden <b>door</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hall closet. [...] A brownie named Thimbletack, who has lived in the house for years, becomes angry with the Grace children when they destroy his nest inside the walls, and Jared is blamed for the ensuing havoc wrought by the brownie in retaliation including assaults on Mallory, Simon, and the trashing of the kitchen. Following a clue in the form of a riddle-poem, Jared finds Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide to the Fantastical World Around You in a secret compartment in a trunk in the attic. The Field Guide is an old hand-written and illustrated book with information on different types of faeries. The novel ends as the Grace children make amends with Thimbletack by building him a new home out of an old birdhouse. Thimbletack then warns them that the book which they found is dangerous and was not meant to be in the hands of mortals.|$|E
