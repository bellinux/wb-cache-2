5|$|It {{just seems}} like a feel-good record but when you really listen to the lyrics, it's about me growing up. In my household, I didn't go all of the parties and I didn't {{do all the things}} {{that a lot of the}} other teenage girls did because I was so <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> radio and my music. I was so in love with this radio and my parents were happy that I was into {{something}} positive.|$|E
5|$|That rebellious {{attitude}} really came, I think, when {{my father}} remarried. Because for the three years before he married, I clung to him. It was like, OK, now you're mine, and you're not going anywhere. Like all young girls, I was <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> father and I didn't want to lose him. I lost my mother, but then I was the mother, my father was mine. Then he got taken away from me when he married my stepmother. It was then that I said, OK I don’t need anybody. No one's going to break my heart again. I'm not going to need anybody. I can stand on my own and be my own person and not belong to anyone.|$|E
25|$|On December 2, 2008, {{prior to}} the Stars' morning skate in {{preparation}} for a game against the Calgary Flames, Avery approached the assembled reporters in the dressing room and stated, “I just want to comment on how it's become like a common thing in the NHL for guys to fall <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> sloppy seconds. I don't know what that's about, but enjoy the game tonight.” At the time, Flames defenseman Dion Phaneuf was dating Avery’s ex-girlfriend, actress Elisha Cuthbert (the pair married in 2012), and Kings center Jarret Stoll was dating model Rachel Hunter (the pair was engaged in 2009, but the wedding was called off), another ex-girlfriend.|$|E
6000|$|His words, I must confess, fired my blood; all my spirits flew {{about my}} heart and put me into {{disorder}} enough, which he might easily have seen in my face. He repeated it afterwards several times, that he was <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> me, and <b>my</b> heart spoke as plain as a voice, that I liked it; nay, whenever he said, 'I am <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> you,' <b>my</b> blushes plainly replied, 'Would you were, sir.' ...|$|R

500|$|The {{reference}} to basketball player Steve Nash in the song's lyrics led to speculation {{that he and}} Furtado were romantically involved, but both deny the link with Nash commenting, [...] "I'm flattered that she put me in her song, but I'm completely <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> wife and two little baby girls". Furtado decided to include him because she and Nash are both from Victoria, British Columbia, and due to frequent citations of basketballers in songs, she decided to [...] "give him the props". In one of the verses Timbaland introduces himself as Thomas Crown. The Thomas Crown Affair is a film about wealthy businessman who plays a cat-and-mouse/flirting game with an insurance investigator. Timbaland only performed the song live on special occasions, such as Furtado's appearance on Saturday Night Live, and the 2006 MuchMusic Video Awards. Starting with Furtado's show at the 94th Grey Cup on 19 November 2006, and extending into the Get Loose Tour, Timbaland's part is filled in by Canadian rapper Saukrates.|$|E
500|$|Most of the lyrical {{themes in}} Simply Deep (2002) speak {{of love and}} life experiences, {{particularly}} in the songs [...] "Dilemma", in which Rowland expresses her endless love to her love interest, and [...] "Stole", in which she sings about an emotional [...] "tale of school shootings and suicides". In Ms. Kelly (2007), Rowland covers topics such as her [...] "deeply personal relationship issues" [...] in her songs, [...] "Still <b>in</b> <b>Love</b> <b>with</b> <b>My</b> Ex", [...] "Flashback", [...] "Love", [...] "Better Without You" [...] and [...] "Gotsta Go (Part I)". Alex Macpherson of The Guardian noted that the songs could be about Rowland's former relationship with American football player Roy Williams. Here I Am (2011) included common themes of womanhood, sexual intimacy and love. Some of Rowland's other songs such as [...] "Work", [...] "I'm Dat Chick" [...] and [...] "Work It Man" [...] have been musically compared {{to the work of}} former Destiny's Child bandmate Beyoncé.

500|$|As the {{daughter}} of actor Jon Voight, Jolie appeared in the media from an early age. After embarking on her own career, she {{earned a reputation as}} a [...] "wild child," [...] which contributed to her early success in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Celebrity profiles routinely covered her fascination with blood and knives, experiences with drugs, and her sex life, particularly her bisexuality and interest in sadomasochism. In 2000, when asked about her outspokenness, she stated, [...] "I say things that other people might go through. That's what artists should do—throw things out there and not be perfect and not have answers for anything and see if people understand." [...] Another contributing factor of her controversial image were tabloid rumors of incest that started when Jolie, upon winning her Oscar, kissed her brother on the lips and said, [...] "I'm so <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> brother right now." [...] She dismissed the rumors, saying, [...] "It was disappointing that something so beautiful and pure could be turned into a circus," [...] and explained that, as children of divorce, she and James relied on one another for emotional support.|$|E

500|$|Corey Moss, {{writing for}} MTV News opined that {{the song was}} {{possibly}} [...] "even more depressing" [...] than Nirvana's eponymous song from 1992. Rolling Stones Rob Sheffield described [...] "Lithium" [...] as Lee's ode to Kurt Cobain. In his review of The Open Door, Andy Gill from The Independent listed [...] "Lithium" [...] {{as one of the}} album's standout tracks; he further noted that it perfectly captures the album's mood [...] "wreathed in the genre staples of black-clad, mascara'd gloom" [...] through lyrics such as [...] "I want to stay <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> sorrow/ Oh, but God I want to let it go". Stephen Thomas Erlewine highlighted the [...] "churning" [...] song as one of the three best on the album. He felt that it was reminiscent of the tracks prevalent on the band's debut album, characterized by similarity to Tori Amos's material and observed that on The Open Door, this type of songs were [...] "ushed to the background". In an album review, Sara Berry from St. Louis Post-Dispatch opined that [...] "The band deftly balances scorching rock anthems with reflective, piano-heavy ballads like 'Lithium'". IGN's Ed Thompson wrote that Lee's [...] "gentle tickling of the ivories" [...] is notably present on [...] "Lithium".|$|E
500|$|Hoppus {{considered}} his lyrical content relatively {{similar to the}} group's prior releases: [...] "The topics are universal. There {{is a lot of}} angst that could be teen angst or it could be angst of everyday life. I still have the same emotions I had 20 years ago – I get frustrated or I get excited. I still feel like I'm falling <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> wife." [...] Hoppus considered common topics he wrote about to be [...] "miscommunication, loss of identity and questioning of identity which is a process we went through just by being in the studio, writing a new Blink record and having a new iteration of Blink." [...] Though in the past he preferred to ruminate on his lyrics for days on end, Feldmann's speedy process gave Hoppus little time to process them. Despite this, he felt he wrote [...] "some of the best lyrics I've written in a long time for this record, because I didn't have a chance to go and overthink things." [...] Hoppus's self-doubt on his own creative process is referenced in the opening lyrics of [...] "Cynical". [...] "I start every song with this fear, thinking I'm never going to write another good song," [...] he told Upset. Skiba said {{that at the time of}} writing the album, he and Hoppus were both reading books such as , Blood Meridian, and The Revenant, and he felt the prose impacted their lyrics: [...] "there were a lot of rushing rivers and the whole idea of using metaphors to describe loneliness, just like settler, Native American and Southern Gothic influence of literature, that was kind of our rhyming dictionary." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, love, independence, and {{maturity}} became reoccurring themes throughout the album. With {{songs such as}} [...] "'I'm Still <b>in</b> <b>Love</b> <b>with</b> <b>My</b> Ex" [...] and [...] "Better Without You" [...] inspired by Rowland's former relationship with American football player Roy Williams, most of the tracks Rowland recorded were relationship-driven, something {{she said she was}} not hesitant about discussing. [...] "I just went in the studio and just did me, because I think that's when you get your best product. That's when it's just natural. It just flew out of my mouth and came out in lyrics [...] I had great writers involved." [...] While recording her vocals, Rowland was inspired by several singers, citing former bandmate Beyoncé Knowles, and singers Brandy and Whitney Houston as major inspirations, [...] "I listened to a lot of Whitney Houston for her vocals. I love her. I love Beyoncé's voice, and I love Brandy. Those are three vocalists who inspire me. I love how different they are. I love how they take themselves to the next level." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2003, Fox made a {{statement}} about her personal life: [...] "I have slept with other women but I've not been <b>in</b> <b>love</b> before Myra Stratton. People say I'm gay.... I don't know what I am. All I know is that I'm <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> Myra <b>my</b> manager. I love her completely and {{want to spend the}} rest of <b>my</b> life <b>with</b> her." [...] Fox said that she had been reluctant to come out because, having already dealt with obsessed fans and stalkers, she feared fans' possible reactions. In 2009, she announced her plans to form a civil partnership with Stratton.|$|R
5000|$|DeVille {{said about}} their first meeting, [...] "Now here I am at 29, a writer, doing pretty good and I've just been asked if I {{want to write}} songs {{with a guy who}} helped lay the {{foundations}} for the music I fell <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> sitting at <b>my</b> mother's kitchen table when I was only seven years old.

2500|$|Recorded {{late into}} the {{production}} of the album, Rowland and her management chose [...] "Like This" [...] as the lead single off Ms. Kelly. Moderately successful on the charts, the song reached the top ten in Canada, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, and dominated the US Dance Club Songs. [...] "Comeback" [...] was sent to urban radio on July 30, 2007, as the album's second single in the United States, while [...] "Work" [...] was released as the second international single and achieved greater success than [...] "Like This". Pushed by a newly produced Freemasons remix, it reached the top ten on the majority of all European and Oceanic music charts. [...] "Ghetto", featuring Snoop Dogg, followed with minor to no commercial success stateside. The album produced previously unreleased [...] "Daylight" [...] as fourth and final single; it became a top twenty success in the United Kingdom and helped introducing the Diva Deluxe reissue. Although never released as a single, Rowland shot a music video for [...] "Comeback" [...] back-to-back with the video for [...] "Work". The track was originally planned to be released as the album's second single alongside ballad [...] "Still <b>in</b> <b>Love</b> <b>with</b> <b>My</b> Ex".|$|E
2500|$|Opening {{song and}} lead single [...] "Like This", which {{features}} rap from Eve, {{was one of}} the last songs recorded for Ms. Kelly. Noted for the use of a cowbell in its melody, the single was first released in March 2007 to mixed reviews and became Rowland's highest-charting solo single since [...] "Stole" [...] (2002). The second track, titled [...] "Comeback", is one of the two tracks Scott Storch contributed to the album. Planned to be released as the album's second single, Rowland shot a music video for the track with director Philip Andelman in July 2007. When a single release failed to materialize, the video premiered on Rowland's official YouTube account in early 2008. [...] "Ghetto" [...] is set as the third track and features rapper Snoop Dogg. Originally recorded for the shelved My Story, the crunk-influenced track was released as the album's second single in North America in August 2007, where it achieved minor success, reaching number nine on the US Billboard Bubbling Under R/Hip-Hop Singles only. The album's fourth track, [...] "Work", was written after returning from a night out in Miami and rushed in [...] "like twenty minutes." [...] An up-tempo composition featuring funk production and go-go elements, it was released as the album's second international single during the first quarter of 2008 and enjoyed major international commercial success, emerging as the highest-charting single off the album. Synthesized [...] "Flashback" [...] is the fifth track of the album and had previously appeared on Destiny's Child's video album [...] (2006). Released to generally lukewarm reviews, the San Francisco Chronicle called it [...] "positively lackluster". [...] "Every Thought Is You", a ballad produced by Rockwilder, garanered positive critics, with About.com noting it [...] "a classy, well-sung mid-tempo track about healthy infatuation". The seventh track [...] "The Show" [...] features a guest appearance by singer Tank, who produced the track. It's followed by an one-minute-long interlude. The ninth track [...] "Still <b>in</b> <b>Love</b> <b>with</b> <b>My</b> Ex" [...] was rumored to be about Rowland's ex-fiancée Roy Williams. The tenth track [...] "Better Without You" [...] speaks about a protagonist who feels better after ending a relationship. It's followed by the eleventh track [...] "Love", and the album closes with a love song [...] "This Is Love".|$|E
