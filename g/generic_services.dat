40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} method for sharing {{interactive}} and dynamic 3 D models that are collaboration-unaware, i. e., models {{that have not been}} designed to be used by multiple users at the same time. This functionality is an essential requirement for the inclusion of arbitrary 3 D models, as generated by standard CAD or animation software, into teleconferencing sessions. A key aim of this work is to show that {{a large part of the}} required functionality can be developed in a way so that it is reusable for other applications such as shared whiteboards or networked computer games. Our method therefore consists of both an application dependent part that handles the specific tasks required for sharing 3 D models, and of a number of <b>generic</b> <b>services</b> such as synchronization, scalable support for latecomers, and the ability to record and replay sessions. The <b>generic</b> <b>services</b> are based on an abstract media model and the RTP/I application level protocol for distributed interactive media. Any other application for a medium that shares this model and that uses RTP/I may reuse these <b>generic</b> <b>services.</b> We have implemented a prototype called TeCo 3 D demonstrating the feasibility of our approach. 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the contention that}} learning environments which use IMS Learning Designs can be created by plugging in different components, using <b>generic</b> <b>service</b> descriptions to create the interface between the Learning Design (LD) and the specific tools. There is an alternative viewpoint which claims that <b>generic</b> <b>service</b> descriptions cannot provide the richness required to fully utilize Learning Design. The paper describes the work performed in the SLED project by the UK Open University and the Open University Netherlands. The SLED project suggests a compromise between the two viewpoints by using <b>generic</b> <b>service</b> descriptions, but recognizing {{the nature of the}} current environment through the use of translators, which interact with specific instantiations of services. 1...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} general {{framework}} for the real-time transmission of interactive media, i. e. media involving user interaction. Examples of interactive media are shared whiteboards, Java animations and VRML worlds. By identifying and supporting the common aspects of this media class the framework allows the development of <b>generic</b> <b>services</b> for network sessions involving the transmission of interactive media. Examples are mechanisms for late join and session recording. The proposed framework {{is based on the}} Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) which is widely used in the Internet for the real-time transmission of audio and video. Using the experience gained through the framework for audio and video, our work consists of three important parts: the definition of a protocol profile, the instantiation of this profile for specific media, and the development of <b>generic</b> <b>services.</b> The profile captures those aspects that are common to the class of interactive media...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{identify}} the <b>generic</b> <b>service</b> quality dimensions of technology-based banking and to {{examine the effect of}} these dimensions on customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. Design/methodology/approach – The <b>generic</b> <b>service</b> quality dimensions are identified using an exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Next {{the reliability and validity of}} the factors and customer satisfaction and customer loyalty are established through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using AMOS 16. 0 s/w. The related hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling using AMOS 16. 0. Findings – The paper identifies four <b>generic</b> <b>service</b> quality dimensions in the technology-based banking services – customer service, technology security and information quality, technology convenience, and technology usage easiness and reliability. It was found that customer service and technology usage easiness and reliability have positive and significant impact on customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. It was also found that technology convenience and customer satisfaction have significant and positive impact on customer loyalty. Practical implications – These dimensions of service quality should be viewed as the levers of improving perceived service quality with respect to technology-based banking in the minds of its current customers. Examining the service quality dimensions' impact on customer satisfaction and customer loyalty for technology-based banking can offer banks valuable insights regarding which aspects of the service to focus on in order to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty towards the firms. Originality/value – This paper introduces the concept of <b>generic</b> <b>service</b> quality and its significance for customer satisfaction and loyalty in case of technology-based banking wherein technology is used to deliver services...|$|R

40|$|NFV and SDN are {{nowadays}} {{seen as a}} solid opportunity by telecom {{operators to}} reduce costs {{while at the same}} time providing new and better services. Recently, the Unify project proposed a multi-layered architecture that, leveraging different levels of abstraction, can orchestrate and deploy generic network services on the physical infrastructure of the telecom operator. In this paper, we exploit such an architecture to deliver end-to-end <b>generic</b> <b>services</b> in presence of multiple concurring players (e. g. network operator, end-users), leveraging a new simple data model. Particularly, we propose a description-based approach allowing the deployment agile, implementation-independent and high-level network services over a distributed set of resources. The resulting data model can abstract <b>generic</b> <b>services,</b> including both middlebox-based (e. g., firewalls, NATs, etc.) and traditional LAN-based ones (e. g., a BitTorrent client). Finally, two distinct prototypes, originated by different design principles, are implemented in order to validate our proposal with the aim of demonstrating the adaptability of our approach to different context...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE – Consumers’ {{underlying}} motives to co-create value {{are important}} when determining {{their willingness to}} engage in co-creation activities. However, {{the importance of their}} motives may vary according to different service contexts. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to contribute to the value co-creation research by investigating how the service contexts shape consumers’ motives to co-create. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH – This paper is based on a survey of 284 consumers. By focusing on professional vs <b>generic</b> <b>services</b> (context), based on differences in knowledge intensity and workforce professionalism, the paper pinpoints the contextual nature of consumer motives to co-create. FINDINGS – The results show that in professional services consumers are positively influenced to co-create by developmental motives, whereas empowerment motives have a negative impact. In turn, the positive effects of individualizing and relating motives are predominant in <b>generic</b> <b>services.</b> Willingness to co-create is a strong determinant of intended co-creation behaviors, regardless of the service type. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS – This study clearly shows the contextual nature of motives to co-create value, thereby questioning the generalizability of single-context studies. ORIGINALITY/VALUE – This is the first paper to compare consumer motives to co-create across different service context...|$|E
