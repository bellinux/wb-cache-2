Three dierent new NP-complete problems, IKHD, IKD and MDCS, are presented for the interactive knapsack models, which are also new. IKD and MDCS are shown to be strongly NP-complete. By using interactive knapsacks we model many planning and scheduling problems in an innovative way. We show Interactive knapsacks to have several applications, for example, in <b>electricity</b> <b>management,</b> single and multiprocessor scheduling and packing of two, three and n dimensional items to dierent containers. Many natural problems related to interactive knapsacks are NP-complete. We apply interactive knapsacks to load clipping used in <b>electricity</b> <b>management</b> in detail. Specically, we implement several heuristic methods, dynamic programming, enumerative and genetic algorithms for solving the load clipping problem. The enumerative method and dynamic programming are slow while heuristics and genetic algorithms are faste [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Distributed {{artificial}} intelligence (DAI) systems, in which multiple agents communicate and co-operate {{with one another}} to achieve their individual and collective goals, are a promising enabling technology for constructing large, real world industrial control applications. To facilitate the development of such systems a number of generic DAI frameworks have been devised. These frameworks typically aid the development process by providing a language, a set of structures, and/or some tools with which the necessary infrastructure and support mechanisms for interacting agents can be instantiated. The paper reports on one such framework, called ARCHON, which {{has been used to}} build DAI systems in the following industrial control domains: <b>electricity</b> distribution <b>management,</b> <b>electricity</b> transportation <b>management,</b> cement factory control, particle accelerator control and flexible assembly robotic cells. A distinguishing and novel feature of the ARCHON framework is that it extends the level of support offered to the system builder - it provides generic and reusable knowledge about the process of cooperation, in addition to the more standard development facilities. This generic knowledge is embedded in a domain-independent co-ordination module and it is the rationale, design, implementation and evaluation of this module which forms the major contribution of the paper...|$|R
