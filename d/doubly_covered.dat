2500|$|Spinors are {{characterized}} by the specific {{way in which they}} behave under rotations. [...] They change in different ways depending not just on the overall final rotation, but the details of how that rotation was achieved (by a continuous path in the rotation group). [...] There are two topologically distinguishable classes (homotopy classes) of paths through rotations that result in the same overall rotation, as famously illustrated by the belt trick puzzle (below). [...] These two inequivalent classes yield spinor transformations of opposite sign. [...] The spin group is the group of all rotations keeping track of the class. It <b>doubly</b> <b>covers</b> the rotation group, since each rotation can be obtained in two inequivalent ways as the endpoint of a path. The space of spinors by definition is equipped with a (complex) linear representation of the spin group, meaning that elements of the spin group act as linear transformations on the space of spinors, in a way that genuinely depends on the homotopy class.|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new notion of minors for simplicial complexes (hypergraphs), so-called homological minors. Our motivation is to propose a general approach to attack certain extremal problems for sparse simplicial complexes and the corresponding threshold problems for random complexes. In this paper, we focus on threshold problems. The basic model for random complexes is the Linial-Meshulam model X k (n, p). By definition, such a complex has n vertices, a complete (k − 1) -dimensional skeleton, and every possible k-dimensional simplex is chosen independently with probability p. We show that for every k, t ≥ 1, {{there is a constant}} C = C(k, t) such that for p ≥ C/n, the random complex X k (n, p) asymptotically almost surely contains K k t (the complete k-dimensional complex on t vertices) as a homological minor. As corollary, the threshold for (topological) embeddability of X k (n, p) into R 2 k is at p = Θ(1 /n). The method can be extended to other models of random complexes (for which the lower skeleta are not necessarily complete) and also to more general Tverberg-type problems, where instead of continuous maps without <b>doubly</b> <b>covered</b> image points (embeddings), we consider maps without q-fold covered image points...|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} of the "dual resonance model" N-point functions BN motivated the development of current string theory. The simplest of these models, the four-point function B 4, is the classical Euler Beta function. Many standard methods of complex analysis in a single variable have been applied to elucidate {{the properties of the}} Euler Beta function, leading, for example, to analytic continuation formulas such as the contour-integral representation obtained by Pochhammer in 1890. Here we explore the geometry underlying the dual five-point function B 5, the simplest generalization of the Euler Beta function. Analyzing the B 5 integrand leads to a polyhedral structure for the five-crosscap surface, embedded in RP 5, that has 12 pentagonal faces and a symmetry group of order 120 in PGL(6). We find a Pochhammer-like representation for B 5 that is a contour integral along a surface of genus five. The symmetric embedding of the five-crosscap surface in RP 5 is <b>doubly</b> <b>covered</b> by a symmetric embedding of the surface of genus four in R 6 that has a polyhedral structure with 24 pentagonal faces and a symmetry group of order 240 in O(6). The methods appear generalizable to all N, and the resulting structures seem to be related to associahedra in arbitrary dimensions. Comment: 43 pages and 44 figure...|$|E
40|$|A variational {{framework}} is developed {{to examine the}} equilibrium states of a semiflexible polymer that is constrained to lie on a fixed surface. As an application the confinement of a closed polymer loop of fixed length 2 piR within a spherical cavity of smaller radius, R 0, is considered. It is shown that {{an infinite number of}} distinct periodic completely attached equilibrium states exist, labeled by two integers: n = 2, 3, 4, [...] . and p = 1, 2, 3, · · ·, the number of periods of the polar and azimuthal angles respectively. Small loops oscillate about a geodesic circle: n = 2, p = 1 is the stable ground state; states with higher n exhibit instabilities. If R ≥ 2 R 0 new states appear as oscillations about a <b>doubly</b> <b>covered</b> geodesic circle; the state n = 3, p = 2 replaces the two-fold as the ground state in a finite band of values of R. With increasing R, loop states make a transition from oscillatory and orbital behavior on crossing the poles, returning to oscillation upon collapse to a multiple cover of a geodesic circle (signaled, respectively, by an increase in p and an increase in n). The force transmitted to the surface does not increase monotonically with loop size, but does asymptotically. It behaves discontinuously where n changes. The contribution to energy from geodesic curvature is bounded. In large loops, the energy becomes dominated by a state independent contribution proportional to the loop size; the energy gap between the ground state and excited states disappears. ...|$|E
40|$|Hermitean Clifford {{analysis}} focusses on h-monogenic functions taking {{values in}} a complex Clifford algebra or {{in a complex}} spinor space. Monogenicity is expressed here by means of two complex mutually adjoint Dirac operators, which are invariant under the action of a Clifford realisation of the unitary group. In this contribution we present a deeper insight in {{the transition from the}} orthogonal setting to the Hermitean one. Starting from the orthogonal Clifford setting, by simply introducing a so-called complex structure J is an element of SO(2 n; R), the fundamental elements of the Hermitean setting arise in a quite natural way. Indeed, the corresponding projection operators 1 / 2 (1 +/- iJ) project the initial basis (e(alpha), alpha = 1, [...] ., 2 n) onto the Witt basis and moreover give rise to a direct sum decomposition of Cl- 2 n(C) into two components, where the SO(2 n; R) -elements leaving those two subspaces invariant, commute with the complex structure J. They generate a subgroup which is <b>doubly</b> <b>covered</b> by a subgroup of Spin(2 n; R), denoted Spin(J) (2 n; R), being isomorphic with the unitary group U(n; C). Finally the two Hermitean Dirac operators are shown to originate as generalized gradients when projecting the gradient on the invariant subspaces mentioned, which actually implies their invariance under the action of Spin(J) (2 n; R). The eventual goal is to extend the complex structure J to the whole Clifford algebra Cl- 2 n(C), in order to conceptually unravel the true meaning of Hermitean monogenicity and its connections to orthogonal monogenicity...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. There are {{two types}} of numerically trivial involutions of an Enriques surface {{according}} as their period lattice. One is U(2) ⊥ U(2) -type and the other is U ⊥ U(2) -type. An Enriques surface with an involution of U(2) ⊥ U(2) -type is <b>doubly</b> <b>covered</b> by a Kummer surface of product type, and such involutions are classified again into two types according as the parity of the corresponding Göpel subgroups. Involutions of odd U(2) ⊥ U(2) type are constructed from the standard Cremona involutions of the quadric surface and closely related with quartic del Pezzo surfaces. It is known that a nontrivial automorphism of a K 3 surface acts nontrivially on its cohomology group. But this is not true for an Enriques surface. An automorphism of an Enriques surface S is said to be numerically trivial (resp. cohomologically trivial) if it acts on the cohomology group H 2 (S, Q) (resp. H 2 (S, Z)) trivially. In this paper we classify the numerically trivial involutions, correcting [3]. Let S be a (minimal) Enriques surface, that is, a compact complex surface with H 1 (OS) = H 2 (OS) = 0 and 2 KS ∼ 0, and σ a numerically trivial (holomorphic) involution of S. We denote the covering K 3 surface of S by ˜ S and the covering involution by ε. Then the period lattice NR of (S, σ) is isomorphic to either U(2) ⊥ U(2) or U ⊥ U(2) as a lattice ([3, Proposition (2. 5) ]). σ is called U(2) ⊥ U(2) -type, or Kummer type, in the former case. In this paper, except the first appendix, we assume that NR U(2) ⊥ U(2) and classify the numerically trivial involutions of Kummer type using their periods, that is, the Hodge structures on NR (cf. Remark 21). There exist a pair of elliptic curves E ′ and E ′ ′ and an isomorphism ϕ between ˜ S and the Kummer surface of the product abelia...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the geometry of}} E_ 8 from a Clifford {{point of view in}} three complementary ways. Firstly, in earlier work, I had shown how to construct the four-dimensional exceptional root systems from the 3 D root systems using Clifford techniques, by constructing them in the 4 D even subalgebra of the 3 D Clifford algebra; for instance the icosahedral root system H_ 3 gives rise to the largest (and therefore exceptional) non-crystallographic root system H_ 4. Arnold's trinities and the McKay correspondence then hint that there might be an indirect connection between the icosahedron and E_ 8. Secondly, in a related construction, I have now made this connection explicit for the first time: in the 8 D Clifford algebra of 3 D space the 120 elements of the icosahedral group H_ 3 are <b>doubly</b> <b>covered</b> by 240 8 -component objects, which endowed with a `reduced inner product' are exactly the E_ 8 root system. It was previously known that E_ 8 splits into H_ 4 -invariant subspaces, and we discuss the folding construction relating the two pictures. This folding is a partial version of the one used for the construction of the Coxeter plane, so thirdly we discuss the geometry of the Coxeter plane in a Clifford algebra framework. We advocate the complete factorisation of the Coxeter versor in the Clifford algebra into exponentials of bivectors describing rotations in orthogonal planes with the rotation angle giving the correct exponents, which gives much more geometric insight than the usual approach of complexification and search for complex eigenvalues. In particular, we explicitly find these factorisations for the 2 D, 3 D and 4 D root systems, D_ 6 as well as E_ 8, whose Coxeter versor factorises as W=(π/ 30 B_C) (11 π/ 30 B_ 2) (7 π/ 30 B_ 3) (13 π/ 30 B_ 4).
