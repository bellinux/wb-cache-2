25|$|By {{the law of}} one price, entirely {{tradable}} goods cannot vary greatly in price by location (because buyers can source from the lowest cost location). However most services must be delivered locally (e.g. <b>hairdressing),</b> and many manufactured goods have high transportation costs, which makes deviations from one price (known as purchasing power parity or PPP-deviations) persistent. The Penn effect is that PPP-deviations usually occur in the same direction: where incomes are high, average price levels are typically high.|$|E

Vernazza paints the clothes of one character. He mixes up the colours of the different dancers’s clothes. Or he paints the body of a great Russian dancer. But the face is Daisy’s.

50|$|Feminization or {{feminisation}} (see spelling differences), {{also known}} as sissification, is {{used to describe the}} practice, especially in female dominance, of switching the gender role of a male submissive. The male in such a process is sometimes and informally known as a sissy. Feminization is usually achieved via cross-dressing, where the male is dressed in female attire, ranging from just wearing female undergarments to being fully dressed in very feminine attire, including make-up, <b>hairdress</b> and nail polish. Some males take on tasks, behaviours and roles that are overtly feminine, and adopt female mannerisms and postures in tasks such as sitting, walking, and acting in a feminine manner. This emasculation may be coupled with punishments such as spanking or caning to gain cooperation and heighten submission of submissive male. Begging and pleading to stop the feminization may be part of the fantasy.|$|R

5000|$|Individuality in women's costume was {{expressed}} through {{their hair and}} headdress. One distinctive feature of women's headwear was the barbette (headdress), a chin band to which a hat or various other headdress might be attached. This hat might be a [...] "woman's coif", which more nearly resembled a pillbox hat, severely plain or fluted. The hair was often confined by a net called a crespine or crespinette, visible only at the back. Later in the century the barbette and coif were reduced to narrow strips of cloth, and the entire <b>hairdress</b> might be covered with the crespine, the hair fashionable bulky over the ears. Coif and barbettes were white, while the crespine might be colored or gold. The wimple and veil of the 12th century still seen on nuns today was still worn, mainly by older women and widows.|$|R
50|$|Singapore {{abolished}} licensed Japanese prostitution in 1921. This {{was part}} of a larger governmental plan to entirely end legalised prostitution throughout the Malay Peninsula. In spite of the ban, many attempted to continue their profession clandestinely; however, both the Singaporean and Japanese governments made efforts to clamp down on the trade. By 1927, there remained roughly 126 independent Japanese prostitutes. Most eventually left Singapore or moved on to other trades. Their departure coincided with a significant shift in the composition of the Japanese population there: the businesses they patronised, such as tailors and <b>hairdresses,</b> run largely by Japanese men, also shut their doors, and their proprietors left as well, to be replaced by salaried employees working in Japanese trading firms. Only 14 Japanese men worked in such professions in 1914, but by 1921 there were 1,478. The shift would continue in the following decade: in 1919, 38.5% of Japanese in Singapore were commodity merchants and 28.0% company and bank employees, but by 1927, these proportions had shifted sharply, to 9.7% merchants and 62.9% employees.|$|R
40|$|This article {{uses the}} {{portrait}} date, the costume in the title, {{and the original}} seals found {{on the back of}} the picture to unveil the mystery of the sitter and to clarify the provenance of Bartolomeo Veneto’s Portrait of a Lady in a Green Dress (1530) from the Timken Museum of Art in San Diego. This portrait is the last signed work of exceptional quality and preservation by the Renaissance master. With rare exception, most of Bartolomeo’s sitters remain anonymous. This paper identifies one of Bartolomeo’s patrons and associates the portrait with an intimate circle of Isabella D’Este. The Timken portrait reveals a complex game of identity in Renaissance courts. Rulers like Isabella d’Este strategically deployed the power and agency of Roman imperial fashions to construct and project their dynastic identity and social status. Through bestowing her exquisite hairdos as gifts, the Marchesa was able to reinforce her ideals and symbolic values. Her daughter-in-laws displayed their allegiance to Isabella visually by wearing <b>hairdresses</b> and costume accessories modeled on her proprietary designs. In turn, Isabella’s Roman-inspired hairstyles aided her in the construction and transmission of her own feminine virtue and political aspirations. ...|$|R

40|$|In May 1987, the Musée Guimet {{bought in}} London a rare {{sculpture}} of a bodhisattva from Nepal. The piece, made by the lost wax process, is in quite pure copper as many old nepali statuettes. It contains some metal shafts to give more solidity to the figure {{before and after the}} cooking. This inside structure appears by radio examination. In the head, its top extremity is scroolled on, in crozier shape. This strange particularity is also present on another {{sculpture of a}} bodhisattva in the Guimet collection (MA 3373). To give a precise iconographical identification of this deity is difficult. The lotus flower, took by the left hand and perhaps supporting some attributes, and disappeared. However, the right hand is depicted in argumentation gesture (vitarka- mudrâ). In the group of eight or sixteen important bodhisattva, only Maitreya and Manjuçrî usually do this mudrâ. In a strict canonical iconography Maitreya, as a bodhisattva, bears a stûpa in his <b>hairdress.</b> It is true that this rule is not strictly used in Nepal. But without any definit argument, it is reasonable to identifie the new bodhisattva of the Musée Guimet as Manjuçrî. The sculpture belongs to the classical style of the XIIe-XIIIe century. Close comparisons with other bronzes give some more similitudes with the imposing figures of the XIIIe century than with the refined pieces of the XIIe century. In the XIVe century, a new taste for affected attitudes and decorative ornaments appears. Béguin Gilles, Drilhon France. Un bodhisattva néwar au musée Guimet.

40|$|Various {{criteria}} {{contribute to}} define this school of sculpture : 1 ° {{till the end}} of the 10 th c, images were imported from Bihar and Northern Bengal. Their number decreases afterwards when, in the 11 th and 12 th c, the local production suddenly increases; 2 ° {{from the very beginning of}} the development, two stylistic (and secondarily here, iconographie) trends exist. The one remains close to the Northern Bengal stylistic school while the other becomes caracteristic of the area. They can also influence each another and works are found which present motifs or forms of motifs of the two groups. The « local » trend is defined by : the umbrella at the top of the stele; the partial representation if not the absence of the royal throne, miniature images of the god or of the avatâras at its place; the position of Garuda in the middle of the pedestal; the belt closed by a knot under the navel, long pendants and one or two rows of pearled arches are hanging from the belt; the kirîtamukuta on the upper flat part of the female <b>hairdress,</b> with the bun on the back of the neck; the short yajnopavîta falling on the waist; the hem of Sûrya's pourpoint underlined by a low relief; the kaustubha carved on Vismi's breast; the jatâmukuta with rounded locks of hair; the padma on which stands or sits the deity directly attached to its roots. These motifs were progressively introduced and their shapes changed in course of time. This school could also influence the Northern school in the 12 th c. : position of Garuda, kaustubha on Visnu's breast, small characters flying in the scrolls springing up from the mouth of the kîrtimukha.

40|$|Na osnovu dosad nepoznatog dokumenta i stilske analize autor utvrđuje znatnu djelatnost korčulanskog kipara i graditelja Marka Andrijića na izgradnji zborne crkve u novom Pagu, osnažujući već izrečene atribucije u vezi s kapitelima u unutrašnjosti, te pripisujući mu reljefe na gornjem dijelu pročelja, a u vezi s tim i dvije građevne faze: artikulaciju unutrašnjosti (prije 1487. godine) i dovršenje pročelja (1491 / 92. godine). The {{construction}} of Saint Mary at Pag started in 1443 and lasted, with several interruptions and changes of architects, till the ene of the 15 th century. Its first builders were two brothers, Pavao and Juraj Dimitrovi from Zadar. It {{is also known}} that Juraj Dalmatinac entered into the contract for the building (or completion) of its front, through he never carried it out. Based on {{a comparison of the}} columns and caitals on the inside with the stylistic features of the ciborium of the Cathedral at Korčula. C. Fiskovć submits that they may be a handwork of Marko Andrijić. As a document from 1492 shows, Andrijić really worked on the church for which he, together with Nicola Alegreti, recevied a pay of seventy ducats. However, since the church was dedicated in 1487, we must asume that the arcades, along with the walls of the central nave and the lateral aisles, as well as the roofing, had alredy been completed by that time and that the mentioned payment concerns some other works. Namely, at that period the completion of the front was already under way, as the litigation between the procurator and the son of Juraj Dalmatinac carried on in September 1491 proves. On the aforesaid occasion the Master’s son rejected the procurator’s offer to carry out his father’s engagement. Therefore, it is highly probable that the front was completed by Marko Andrijić in collaboration with Nicola Algreti. The hypothesis may be further corroborated by the reliefs on {{the upper part of the}} front, showing considerable analogies with the verified works by this master, particularly with the figure of the Virgin which is betrayed by the same awkward posture and the some treatment of drapery, and whose face bears an expression very much alike that of the figure from the ciborium at Korčula. The same may be said of the faces and <b>hairdresses</b> of the unfinished figures of the Saints George and Michael and the Angel Gabriel. Therefore, we submit that Marko Andrijić worked on the church of Pag on two occasions: prior to 1487 he articulated its interior by a harmonious row of arcades, sculpturing tha capitals by himself while from the end of 1491 till the end of 1492 he completed the fornt decorating it with figures in high relief, leaving some of them unfinished because the commissioner fell into financial difficulties. The Pag works add to the known oeuvre of the builder and sculptor from Korčula, confirming his comparatively limited artistc achievements and the dominant Gothic tradition (especially in sculpture) which prevail upon the fresh Renaissance influences...|$|R
