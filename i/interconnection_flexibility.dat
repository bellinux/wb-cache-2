40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{presents}} a customized approach to rapid prototyping {{based on a}} new chip design. The chip is named FLYSIG and adapts the prototyping architecture to the target architecture and the application domain in view. The chip architecture is scalable {{according to the requirements}} of arithmetic operators and <b>interconnection</b> <b>flexibility.</b> The prototyping chip is configurable in terms of operator functionality and operator interconnection. A FL- YSIG prototyping chip with 720 add / sub operators has been already been designed and a smaller version is just running through the fab. The design process of FLYSIG based rapid prototyping is supported by tools providing automated scheduling, performance analysis and code generation. The FLYSIG prototyping approach is illustrated by an example of reasonable complexity, i. e. a nested loop convolution algorithm which could be prototyped with the FLYSIG approach easily...|$|E
40|$|Semiconductor {{technology}} scaling {{has long}} been a source of dramatic gains in our computing capabilities. However, as we test the physical limits of silicon feature size, serious reliability and computational efficiency challenges confront us. The supply voltage levels have practically stagnated, resulting in increasing power densities and operating temperatures. Given that most semiconductor wearout mechanisms are highly dependent on these parameters, significantly higher failure rates are projected for future technology generations. Further, the rise in power density is also limiting the number of resources that can be kept active on chip simultaneously, motivating the need for energy-efficient computing. In this landscape of technological challenges, incremental architectural improvements to existing designs are likely insufficient, motivating a need to rethink the architectural fabric from the ground up. Towards this end, this thesis presents adaptive architecture and compiler solutions that can effectively tackle reliability, performance and energy-efficiency demands expected in future microprocessors. For the reliability challenge, we present StageNet, a highly reconfigurable multicore architecture that is designed as a network of pipeline stages, rather than isolated cores. The <b>interconnection</b> <b>flexibility</b> in StageNet allows it to adaptively route around defective pieces of a processor, and deliver graceful performance degradation in the face of failures. We further complement the fault isolation ability of StageNet with an adaptive testing framework that significantly reduces the overhead of in-field fault detection. As a second contribution, we build upon the <b>interconnection</b> <b>flexibility</b> of StageNet to develop a unified performance-reliability solution. This subsequent design, named CoreGenesis, relies on a set of microarchitectural innovations and compiler hints to merge processor cores for a higher single-thread performance. This enables customization of processing ability (narrow or wide-issue pipelines) to the dynamic workload requirements. In the final work of this thesis, we investigate the sources of computational inefficiency in general purpose processors, and propose a configurable compute engine, named BERET, for substantial energy savings. The insight here is {{to cut down on the}} redundant instruction fetch, decode and register file access energy by optimizing the execution of recurring instruction sequences...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{complete}} {{review of}} the data vortex optical packet switched (OPS) interconnection network architecture is presented. The distributed multistage network topology {{is based on a}} banyan structure and incorporates a deflection routing scheme ideally suited for implementation with optical components. An implemented 12 -port system prototype employs broadband semiconductor optical amplifier switching nodes and is capable of successfully routing multichannel wavelength-division multiplexing packets while maintaining practically error-free signal integrity (BER 10 12) with median latencies of 110 ns. Packet contentions are resolved without the use of optical buffers via a distributed deflection routing control scheme. The entire payload path in the optical domain exhibits a capacity of nearly 1 Tb/s. Further experimental measurements investigate the OPS <b>interconnection</b> network’s <b>flexibility</b> and robustness in terms of optical power dynamic range and network timing. Subsequent experimental investigations support the physical layer scalability of the implemented architecture and serve to substantiate the merits of the data vortex OPS network architectural paradigm. Finally, modified design considerations that aim to increase the network throughput and device-level performance are presented. Index Terms—Interconnection networks (multiprocessor), optical interconnections, packet switching, photonic switching systems, wavelength-division multiplexing. I...|$|R
40|$|Manufacture-time process {{variation}} and life-time failure projections {{have become a}} major industry concern. Consequently, fault tolerance, historically of interest only for mission-critical systems, is now gaining attention in the mainstream computing space. Traditionally reliability issues have been addressed at a coarse granularity, e. g., by disabling faulty cores in chip multiprocessors. However, this is not scalable to higher failure rates. In this paper, we propose StageWeb, a fine-grained wearout and variation tolerance solution, that employs a reconfigurable web of replicated processor pipeline stages to construct dependable many-core chips. The <b>interconnection</b> <b>flexibility</b> of StageWeb simultaneously tackles wearout failures (by isolating broken stages) and process variation (by selectively disabling slower stages). Our experiments show that through its wearout tolerance, a StageWeb chip performs up to 70 % more cumulative work than a comparable chip multiprocessor. Further, variation mitigation in StageWeb enables it to scale supply voltage more aggressively, resulting in up to 16 % energy savings...|$|E
40|$|Single-thread performance, {{reliability}} and power efficiency are critical design challenges of future multicore systems. Although point solutions {{have been proposed}} to address these issues, a more fundamental change to the fabric of multicore systems is necessary to seamlessly combat these challenges. Towards this end, this paper proposes CoreGenesis, a dynamically adaptive multiprocessor fabric that blurs out individual core boundaries, and encourages resource sharing across cores for performance, fault tolerance and customized processing. Further, {{as a manifestation of}} this vision, the paper provides details of a unified performance-reliability solution that can assemble variable-width processors from a network of (potentially broken) pipeline stage-level resources. This design relies on <b>interconnection</b> <b>flexibility,</b> microarchitectural innovations, and compiler directed instruction steering, to merge pipeline resources for high single-thread performance. The same flexibility enables it to route around broken components, achieving sub-core level defect isolation. Together, the resulting fabric consists of a pool of pipeline stage-level resources that can be fluidly allocated for accelerating single-thread performance, throughput computing, or tolerating failures...|$|E
40|$|The growing {{penetration}} of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems requires a fundamental {{understanding of its}} impact at a system-level. Furthermore, distributed energy storage (DES) technologies, such as batteries, are attracting great interest owing {{to their ability to}} provide support to systems with large-scale renewable generation, such as PV. In this light, the system-level impacts of PV and DES are assessed from both operational and adequacy perspectives. Different control strategies for DES are proposed, namely: (1) centralised, to support system operation in the presence of increasing requirements on system ramping and frequency control; and (2) decentralised, to maximise the harnessing of solar energy from individual households while storing electricity generated by PV panels to provide system capacity on request. The operational impacts are assessed by deploying a multi-service unit commitment model with consideration of inertial constraints, dynamic reserve allocation, and <b>interconnection</b> <b>flexibility,</b> while the impacts on adequacy of supply are analysed by assessing the capacity credit of PV and DES through different metrics. The models developed are then applied to different future scenarios for the Great Britain power system, whereby an electricity demand increase due to electrification is also considered. The numerical results highlight the importance of interconnectors to provide flexibility. On the other hand, provision of reserves, as opposed to energy arbitrage, from DES that are integrated into system operation is seen as the most effective contribution to improve system performance, which in turn also decreases the role of interconnectors. DES can also contribute to providing system capacity, but to an extent that is limited by their individual and aggregated energy availability under different control strategies...|$|E
40|$|We have {{successfully}} demonstrated an 8 -bit microprocessor using passive transmission lines based on single-flux-quantum LSI technology. In the microprocessor designed here, called CORE 1 alpha 6, a simple bit-serial architecture with seven instructions was employed. In the CORE 1 alpha 6, the floor plan was designed with consideration toward integration of a memory, and superconductive passive transmission lines (PTLs) {{were used to}} connect circuit blocks. Utilization of PTLs helped us reduce the propagation delay in long <b>interconnections.</b> The design <b>flexibility</b> of the floor plan was enhanced {{and the performance of}} the microprocessor was improved by 20 % compared with our previous design.

40|$|Photovoltaic linear {{concentrator}} arrays {{can benefit from}} high performance solar cell technologies being developed at AstroPower. Specifically, these are the integration of thin GaAs solar cell and epitaxial lateral overgrowth technologies with the application of monolithically interconnected solar cell (MISC) techniques. This MISC array has several advantages which make it ideal for space concentrator systems. These are high system voltage, reliable low cost monolithically formed <b>interconnections,</b> design <b>flexibility,</b> costs that are independent of array voltage, and low power loss from shorts, opens, and impact damage. This concentrator solar cell will incorporate the benefits of light trapping by growing the device active layers over a low-cost, simple, PECVD deposited silicon/silicon dioxide Bragg reflector. The high voltage-low current output results in minimal 12 R losses while properly designing the device allows for minimal shading and resistance losses. It is possible to obtain open circuit voltages as high as 67 volts/cm of solar cell length with existing technology. The projected power density for the high performance device is 5 kW/m for an AMO efficiency of 26 % at 1 5 X. Concentrator solar cell arrays are necessary to meet the power requirements of specific mission platforms and can supply high voltage power for electric propulsion systems. It is anticipated that the high efficiency, GaAs monolithically interconnected {{linear concentrator}} solar cell array will enjoy widespread application for space based solar power needs. Additional applications include remote man-portable or ultra-light unmanned air vehicle (UAV) power supplies where high power per area, high radiation hardness and a high bus voltage or low bus current are important.
