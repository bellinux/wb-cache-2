5|$|The Agni Purana {{mentions}} only 4 hells. Some texts mention 7 hells: Put ("childless", for the childless), Avichi ("waveless", {{for those}} waiting for reincarnation), Samhata ("abandoned", for evil beings), Tamisra ("darkness", where darkness of hells begin), Rijisha ("expelled", where torments of hell begin), Kudmala ("leprous", the worst hell {{for those who}} are going to be reincarnated) and Kakola ("black poison", the bottomless pit, {{for those who are}} eternally condemned to hell and <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>chance</b> of reincarnation).|$|E
5|$|Susan Hall {{wrote that}} there is no rule of law in the books, as the actions of Ministry of Magic {{officials}} are unconstrained by laws, accountability or any kind of legal challenge. This provides an opportunity for Voldemort to offer his own horrific version of order. As a side-effect Harry and Hermione, who were brought up in the highly regulated Muggle world, find solutions by thinking in ways unfamiliar to wizards. For example, Hermione notes that one obstacle to finding the Philosopher's Stone is a test of logic rather than magical power, and that most wizards <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>chance</b> of solving it.|$|E

25|$|It was {{intended}} that bonus rounds {{such as the}} car-smashing stage from earlier Street Fighter games would return. Ono later stated that the bonus stages {{would not be in}} the arcade game, citing the reason to be that the time players spend on bonus stages is time during which they <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>chance</b> of losing, which ultimately takes money from arcade operators.|$|E
25|$|Almost all of non-government {{expenditure}} on R {{comes from}} private firms (private universities performing {{only a fraction}} of it). Between 2010 and 2013, this expenditure declined from 49% to 42% of domestic expenditure on research, according to preliminary government data. This trend is likely to last for some time. The business sector will, thus, <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>chance</b> of devoting 0.90% of GDP to R by 2014.|$|E
25|$|His {{first major}} act was to {{institute}} the Wild Card and divisional playoff play, which has created much controversy amongst baseball fans. Those against the Wild Card {{see it as}} diminishing {{the importance of the}} pennant race and the regular season, with the true race often being for second rather than first place, while those in favor of it view it as an opportunity for teams to have a shot at the playoffs even when they <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>chance</b> of a first-place finish in their division, thus maintaining fan interest later in the season.|$|E

25|$|Guanyin is {{immensely popular}} among Chinese Buddhists, {{especially}} those from devotional schools. She is generally {{seen as a}} source of unconditional love and, more importantly, as a saviour. In her bodhisattva vow, Guanyin promises to answer the cries and pleas of all sentient beings and to liberate them from their own karmic woes. Based on the Lotus Sutra and the Shurangama sutra, Avalokitesvara is generally seen as a saviour, both spiritually and physically. The sutras state that through his saving grace even those who <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>chance</b> of being enlightened can be enlightened, and those deep in negative karma can still find salvation through his compassion.|$|E
25|$|Nonprobability {{sampling}} is any {{sampling method}} where {{some elements of}} the population <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>chance</b> of selection (these are {{sometimes referred to as}} 'out of coverage'/'undercovered'), or where the probability of selection can't be accurately determined. It involves the selection of elements based on assumptions regarding the population of interest, which forms the criteria for selection. Hence, because the selection of elements is nonrandom, nonprobability sampling does not allow the estimation of sampling errors. These conditions give rise to exclusion bias, placing limits on how much information a sample can provide about the population. Information about the relationship between sample and population is limited, making it difficult to extrapolate from the sample to the population.|$|E
25|$|Assad {{believed}} that Syria would <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>chance</b> {{in a war}} against Israel without Egyptian participation. He {{believed that}} if the United Arab Republic had not collapsed, the Arabs would already have liberated Palestine. For a war against Israel, Syria needed to establish another front. However, by this time Syria's relations with Egypt and Jordan were shaky at best. Planning for war began in 1971 with an agreement between Assad and Anwar Sadat. At the beginning, the renewed Egyptian–Syrian alliance was based upon the proposed Federation of Arab Republics (FAR), a federation initially encompassing Egypt, Libya, Sudan (which left soon after FAR's first summit) and Syria. Assad and Sadat used the FAR summits to plan war strategy, and by 1971 they had appointed Egyptian General Muhammad Sadiq supreme commander of both armies. From 1972 to 1973, the countries filled their arsenals and trained their armies. In a secret meeting of the Egyptian–Syrian Military Council from 21 to 23 August 1973, the two chiefs of staff (Syrian Yusuf Shakkur and Egyptian Sad al-Shazly) signed a document declaring their intention {{to go to war}} against Israel. During a meeting of Assad, Sadat and their respective defense ministers (Tlass and Hosni Mubarak) on 26–27 August, the two leaders decided to go to war together.|$|E

25|$|The Central Zoo Authority of India (CZA) has {{identified}} the park as coordinating zoo for the breeding programmes for endangered species as per the National Zoo Policy {{adopted by the}} Government of India in 1988, which states that the main objective of zoos will be to complement and strengthen national efforts in the conservation of the country's rich biodiversity and that the species which <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>chance</b> of survival in the wild would be bred under ex-situ conditions. The park has {{a high rate of}} success in captive breeding of lion-tailed macaques. In 2010, the zoo had 22 lion-tailed macaques, from a breeding pair that were brought to the zoo in 1983. The park is also successful in breeding other rare species in captivity, including ostrich, Asian palm civet, Indian gaur, wild dog, Asiatic lion, Nilgiri langur, sangai, hippo, Malabar giant squirrel, white tiger, Asiatic wolf, panther and bison. The zoo is among four in the country to have an ostrich. The park also undertakes cross-breeding as part of its conservation efforts. The park is also a participating zoo of the CZA for the captive breeding of rock python, Nilgiri langur, lion-tailed macaque, Asiatic lion, wild dog, Asiatic wolf, and gaur. The zoo also promotes exterior conservation—conservation of rare species in their natural habitat—whereby individuals born in the zoo are released in the wild after adequate training, as per the guidelines of the CZA.|$|E

With a limited knowledge of the X-Men mythos, Ratner trusted his writers on doing something faithful to the comics, having the script drawing all of its scenes from the original Marvel publications.|$|E

500|$|Croatian delegates {{were outraged}} by the final decision, {{particularly}} as this was their third bid in recent years; Croatia made bids in 1995 and 1999 for the 1997 and 2001 Mediterranean Games, respectively. Former Prime Minister of Croatia {{and the president of}} the Croatian Olympic Committee Zlatko Mateša expressed his disappointment, [...] "it just shows, once again, that small countries <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>chance</b> of competing with the big ones." [...] The Croatian bid was supported by the president and CEO of Formula One Management and Formula One Administration Bernie Ecclestone, 1992 Olympic bronze medallist in tennis Goran Ivanišević and 1998 FIFA World Cup Golden Shoe Award winner Davor Šuker.|$|E

The Earth's climate would enter a chaotic era lasting thousands of years before natural processes eventually establish some sort of equilibrium. Whether human beings would still be a force on the planet, or even survive, is a moot point. One thing seems certain: there will be far fewer of us.|$|E

Jon Snow defends Sam and convinces {{the rest of the}} recruits not to harm him, much to Thorne's rage.

500|$|Amondson was {{nominated}} for President at the 2008 Prohibition Party National Convention in Indianapolis. About 10 to 15 people attended the event. Earl Dodge died late in 2007, which reunified the split party. Similar to 2004, Amondson's based his campaign on media interviews. He spoke with Wikinews in June 2008, admitting that third party candidates such as himself <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>chance</b> of winning elections. Instead, he remarked, they [...] "say wise things." [...] When given a choice, Amondson favored {{the election of a}} Republican over a Democrat because of the policies on Israel and the ideological difference in justices nominated to the Supreme Court. Amondson wanted former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich as his running mate, but the designation went to activist Leroy Pletten.|$|E
500|$|Bowyer {{and his men}} {{arrived at}} the train station south of Wytheville at 5:10pm, when the Union brigade was about [...] north of town. The depot was about [...] south of the center of town. The {{artillery}} was unloaded from the train, but horses could not be found to move it. Bowyer, with assistance from Kent and Abraham Umbarger from the local militia, distributed his extra small arms to the local citizens. A small line of rebels had already formed {{on the north side of}} town. By 5:30, Bowyer's men began moving from the depot toward town. Bowyer wanted to bring all armed citizens to the railroad depot, where he believed he could use his artillery. Kent rejected that idea, believing they would <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>chance</b> against a quick strike from the horsemen. [...] Kent moved his citizen volunteers into houses and buildings, while most of Bowyer's men stayed near the courthouse or at the south end of town.|$|E
