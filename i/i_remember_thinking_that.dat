2500|$|One of {{the issues}} was the album's {{complexity}} and how the touring Beach Boys {{would be able to}} perform its music live. Wilson said that the band [...] "didn't like the idea of growing musically... They wanted to keep making car songs and I said 'No, we've gotta grow, guys'." [...] On another occasion, he recalled: [...] "They liked [...] but they said it was too arty. I said, 'No, it is not!" [...] Marilyn said: [...] "When Brian was writing Pet Sounds, it was difficult for the guys to understand what he was going through emotionally and what he wanted to create.... they didn't feel what he was going through and what direction he was trying to go in." [...] Tony Asher remembered: [...] "All those guys in the band, certainly Al, Dennis, and Mike, were constantly saying, 'What the fuck do these words mean?' or 'This isn't our kind of shit!' Brian had comebacks, though. He'd say, 'Oh, you guys can't hack this.'...But <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> those were tense sessions." ...|$|E

5000|$|Though urban {{legends of}} a similar adulterous {{situation}} circulated at the time, LaBute has said he was actually inspired to write the play when, after the events of September 11, his flight from Chicago to New York City was cancelled {{and he had to}} take a 21-hour train ride. LaBute explained to The New York Times that he thought, [...] "This is inconvenient....and <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>thinking,</b> 'Ooh, <b>that's</b> not a very good thought to have.' I knew it wasn't right, but the thought had already come out." ...|$|R
6000|$|As I {{entered the}} hall I saw {{her at the}} far end of it talking to Mr. Allen. This I thought strange, for I knew she disliked him. Lord Comyn and Mr. Carroll, the barrister, and Singleton, were {{standing}} by, listening. By the time I was halfway across to them the rector turned away. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>thinking</b> afterwards <b>that</b> he changed colour when he said: [...] "Your servant, Mr. Richard."

60|$|I know, Ned Phipps, who knelt against me, and I am sure made me behave {{much worse}} than I should have done without him, whispered that he thought the Bishop was a 'guy', and <b>I</b> {{certainly}} <b>remember</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Prendergast looked much more dignified with his plain white surplice and black hair. He was a tall commanding man, and read the Liturgy in a strikingly sonorous and uniform voice, which I tried to imitate the next Sunday at home, until my little sister began to cry, and said I was 'yoaring at her'.|$|R
5000|$|Journalism {{is not a}} {{profession}} ... at its heart, it's just a craft. And that means {{that it can be}} practiced by anyone who is sensible and intelligent and thoughtful and curious ... I go back to the morning of Virginia Tech - the morning I decided I wanted to work the Wikimedia Foundation. The conversation on the talk page that day was extremely thoughtful. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>thinking</b> to myself <b>that</b> if my own newsroom had been having a conversation that intelligent (I was offsite that day) I would have been delighted.

5000|$|Eugenides knew {{he wanted}} to be a writer from a {{relatively}} early age, stating [...] "I decided very early; during my junior year of high school. We read A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man that year, and it had a big effect on me, for reasons that seem quite amusing to me now. I'm half Irish and half Greek—my mother's family were Kentuckians, Southern hillbillies, and my paternal grandparents immigrants from Asia Minor—and, for that reason, I identified with Stephen Dedalus. Like me, he was bookish, good at academics, and possessed an “absurd name, an ancient Greek.” ... <b>I</b> do <b>remember</b> <b>thinking</b> ... <b>that</b> to be a writer was the best thing a person could be. It seemed to promise maximum alertness to life. It seemed holy to me, and almost religious." [...] Of his earliest literary influences, Eugenides has cited [...] "... the great modernists. Joyce, Proust, Faulkner. From these I went on to discover Musil, Woolf, and others, and soon my friends and I were reading Pynchon and John Barth. My generation grew up backward. We were weaned on experimental writing before ever reading much of the nineteenth-century literature the modernists and postmodernists were reacting against." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I {{suppose it}} comes to this, {{that he has a}} new pair {{whenever}} he wants them. But what constitutes the want? Does he ever say to himself that they'll do for another Sunday?

60|$|Another hour; {{the slope}} of the great peak could not be more than two miles away now. A couple of hundred yards off grew a large baobab tree. Could we reach its shade? We had done half the {{distance}} when Indaba-zimbi fell from exhaustion. We were now so weak that neither of us could lift the child on to our backs. He rose again, and we each took one of her hands and dragged her along the road. Fifty yards--they seemed to be fifty miles. Ah, the tree was reached at last; compared with the heat outside, the shade of its dense foliage seemed like the dusk and cool of a vault. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> it was a good place to die in. Then I remember no more.|$|E
60|$|He {{had just}} renounced his velveteen, {{and even those}} cuffs turned {{backward}} over the sleeves, and had begun to dress very carefully in the fashion of the moment. He lived in a little house at Chelsea that the architect Godwin had decorated with an elegance that owed something to Whistler. There was nothing mediaeval, nor Pre-Raphaelite, no cupboard door with figures upon flat gold, no peacock blue, no dark background. I remember vaguely a white drawing room with Whistler etchings, 'let in' to white panels, and a dining room all white: chairs, walls, mantlepiece, carpet, except for a diamond-shaped piece of red cloth {{in the middle of}} the table under a terra cotta statuette, and I think a red shaded lamp hanging from the ceiling to a little above the statuette. It was perhaps too perfect in its unity, his past of a few years before had gone too completely, and <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> the perfect harmony of his life there, with his beautiful wife and his two young children, suggested some deliberate artistic composition.|$|E
5000|$|Smith {{joined the}} Peace Corps serving {{four years as}} a {{volunteer}} in Botswana. During her Peace Corps service she {{was struck by the}} fact that [...] "the most needy are often the least empowered to invent solutions to their problems." [...] While she was serving in the middle of the Kalahari Desert, she decided what she wanted to do with the rest of her life. [...] "At one point I had sort of an epiphany, sitting at my desk looking out over the bush, when I realized I wanted to do engineering for developing countries", Smith said. [...] "In Botswana, I was teaching and then working for the ministry of agriculture as a beekeeper, and <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>thinking</b> to myself <b>that</b> <b>I</b> really liked doing development work, but I wished could do some engineering too, because I like creative problem solving", says Smith. [...] "People in the developing world scrape every last ounce of life that they can out of objects, and my students used to bring me things to fix, and I always enjoyed being able to do that." ...|$|R
5000|$|I {{auditioned for}} the show back in late July or early August of 2012. I had been auditioning that summer for more {{television}} and film doing much theater. I'd {{read a lot of}} scripts and <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> reading Orange <b>Is</b> the New Black, and it was {{at the head of the}} pack. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>thinking,</b> 'Wow, <b>that</b> is really good, I would love to be a part of that.' I went in and auditioned for another part, and my representatives called me about a month later and they were like, [...] "Hi, we have some really good news. You remember that audition you went on for Orange Is the New Black? You didn't get it." [...] I go, [...] "So… okay, what's the good news?" [...] They said they wanted to offer me another part, Crazy Eyes. I was like, [...] "What in my audition would make someone think I'd be right for a part called Crazy Eyes?" [...] But to be honest, when I got the script for it, it felt like the right fit.Casting director Jennifer Euston explains the selection of Aduba for the role thus: [...] "Uzo Aduba...had her hair in those knots for the audition...They saw something amazing in her and were able to connect it to what they were looking for in Crazy Eyes." [...] In joining the series, Aduba obtained her Screen Actors Guild card, about which she says, [...] "I was just like, 'Wow, this means I'm a full actor now.' It was such a big deal, and <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> being so thankful and feeling so proud." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the {{interview}} with GoldFlakePaint, Graham notes closing track [...] "Sometimes I Wished I Could Fall Asleep" [...] as the song where the album began to come together for him. [...] "That song opened it all up for me. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>thinking</b> 'we've got <b>that</b> now, that's going on the record no matter what,' and it always felt like the perfect closing statement." [...] Musically, the song is a stripped-down piano track, while lyrically, Graham said that [...] "when 'Fall Asleep' happened I suddenly knew what I wanted to say. I got it out of me. I think it's the most fucking 'out there' I've ever been. I usually {{use a lot of}} metaphors, but on that I didn't really do it, I just said it how it is. ... Once I wrote it and listened to it back I did question if it was OK to do that. I've always put myself out there as a songwriter but it's always been hidden somewhat. I'm glad I chose not to be for once though, because it really kick-started the whole album for me." [...] He also cites [...] "It Never Was the Same" [...] and the title track as two songs that [...] "explain the whole theme of the record", and that those songs especially made the band feel confident in the album's direction.|$|R
6000|$|My {{knowledge}} of Mr. William Morris's poetry begins in years {{so far away}} that they seem like reminiscences of another existence. I remember sitting beneath Cardinal Beaton's ruined castle at St. Andrews, looking across the bay to the sunset, while some one repeated [...] "Two Red Roses across the Moon." [...] And <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> the poem was nonsense. With Mr. Morris's other early verses, [...] "The Defence of Guinevere," [...] this song of {{the moon and the}} roses was published in 1858. Probably the little book won no attention; it is not popular even now. Yet the lyrics remain in memories which forget all but a general impression of the vast [...] "Earthly Paradise," [...] that huge decorative poem, in which slim maidens and green-clad men, and waters wan, and flowering apple trees, and rich palaces are all mingled as on some long ancient tapestry, shaken a little by the wind of death. They are not living and breathing people, these persons of the fables; they are but shadows, beautiful and faint, and their poem is fit reading for sleepy summer afternoons. But the characters in the lyrics in [...] "The Defence of Guinevere" [...] are people of flesh and blood, under their chain armour and their velvet, and the trappings of their tabards.|$|E
6000|$|I saw a {{good deal}} of Wilde at that time--was it 1887 or 1888?--I have no way of fixing the date except that I had {{published}} my first book The Wanderings of Usheen and that Wilde had not yet published his Decay of Lying. He had, before our first meeting, reviewed my book and despite its vagueness of intention, and the inexactness of its speech, praised without qualification; and what was worth more than any review he had talked about it and now he asked me to eat my Christmas dinner with him believing, I imagine, that I was alone in London. He had just renounced his velveteen, and even those cuffs turned backward over the sleeves, and had begun to dress very carefully in the fashion of the moment. He lived in a little house at Chelsea that the architect Godwin had decorated with an elegance that owed something to Whistler. There was nothing mediaeval, nor Pre-Raphaelite, no cupboard door with figures upon flat gold, no peacock blue, no dark background.

40|$|The opening {{moments of}} a phone call reveal how a father informs his son, for the 1 st time, that his mom’s tumor is malignant. An {{extended}} phone opening reveals how delaying talk about the mom’s condition allows for important interactional work: Displaying resistance to announce the bad news directly, projecting and anticipat-ing the valence of forthcoming news prior to its announcement, and delicately shar-ing ownership of a serious health condition {{at the outset of}} a family cancer journey. Enacting a biomedical demeanor, replete with technical language and withholdings of emotional and personal reactions, subsequent delivery and reception of the bad news is managed stoically–a normalized resource employed by consequential fig-ures when managing and coping with dreaded news events. By closely examining how family members talk through cancer on the telephone, the scope of health com-munication research is extended beyond clinical settings into home environments, progress is made on the noticeable absence of interactional studies in psycho-oncol-ogy, and diverse implications arise for understanding how lay persons diagnose and manage illness dilemmas. In a written reflection of his mother’s death 10 years earlier, a son depicts calling his father on the phone and being informed that “mother had cancer”: My father answered. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>thinking</b> almost immediately <b>that</b> some-thing seemed wrong. Then he told me that my mother had cancer … When the call ended, my mind was reeling … I looked around the room for something to focus on. My eyes fell on the recorder.

5000|$|When {{asked in}} 2001 {{whether or not}} [...] "Dazed" [...] was {{influenced}} by the early psychedelic rock of the previous year or the current psychedelia of 1967, Holmes acknowledged that he was influenced by psychedelic rock and the Byrds: It's kind of hard for me to remember which came first, the chicken or the egg. We were certainly watching the Blues Project at the time. There wasn't anything that they were doing, though, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>thinking</b> [...] "Wow, <b>that's</b> cool. I'd like to do something like that." [...] I was very arrogant in that I wanted to be my own person. Nowadays, I think everybody's amazing. Back then I thought nobody could do anything. I thought it was all bad... I {{was influenced by the}} rock thing in a sense. I didn't want to be rock and roll, but I did like the energy and the mysteriousness and the darkness and the blues of it all. I did like that. I loved the Byrds. Holmes' singing is pitched, edgy, and the dark paranoia of some of the song's lyrics ("you're out to get me/you're on the right track") and ("I'm being abused/I'm better of dead"), coupled with the dissonant string bends of the instrumental break led some music writers and other sources to assume the song was about a bad acid trip; but Holmes said [...] "Dazed" [...] was a [...] "song about a girl": I never took acid. I smoked grass and tripped on it, but I never took acid. I was afraid to take it. The song's about a girl who hasn't decided whether she wants to stay with me or not. It's pretty much one of those love songs.|$|R
5000|$|A sailor {{on board}} an escort ship wrote: [...] "We had {{great respect for}} the Merchant seamen.

Granted the pilots did a marvellous, marvellous job, but when you stop and think, how did they get the fuel across to fly those planes, it was the Merchant seamen.....And, honestly, I think they're the bravest men out, the Merchant Navy." [...] Admiral Lord Mountevans wrote after the war: [...] "Those of us who have escorted convoys in either of the great wars can never forget the days and especially the nights spent in company with those slow-moving squadron of iron tramps - the wisps of smoke from their funnels, the phosphorescent wakes, the metallic clang of iron doors {{at the end of the}} night watches which told us that the Merchant Service firemen were coming up after four hours in the heated engine rooms, or boiler rooms, where they had run the gauntlet of torpedo or mine for perhaps half the years of the war. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> so often <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> those in the engine rooms, if they were torpedoed, would probably be drowned before they reached the engine room steps..." [...] Historian John Keegan wrote: [...] "The 30,000 men of the British Merchant Navy who fell victim to the U-boats between 1939 and 1945, the majority drowned or killed by exposure on the cruel North Atlantic sea, were quite as certainly front-line warriors as the guardsmen and fighter pilots to whom they ferried the necessities of combat. Neither they nor their American, Dutch, Norwegian or Greek fellow mariners wore uniform and few have any memorial. They stood nevertheless between the Wehrmacht and the domination of the world".|$|R
