40|$|Based on data {{analysis}} for the aviation <b>grouding</b> period over the USA following the Sep 2001 terrorists attack, Travis et al. (2002, 2004) have suggested {{the existence of a}} strong effect of aircraft condensation trails on the diurnal temperature range (DTR). The alleged effect of more than 1 K would match, even exceed analysed DTR trends over the USA. As the grounding period did extend only over 3 consecutive days following 11 Sep, 2001, the quantitative aspect of the Travis hypothesis calls for an independent cross check with a larger set of data, which may produce statistically more reliable conclusions. We present results of the ECHAM climate model (that includes a contrail parameterisation) and results of ERA- 40 Reanalyses to investigate the topic. ECHAM systematically underestimates the DTR over land, but captures the observed DTR geographical distribution and the correlation between DTR and cloudiness. In both simulated and model data, a correlation of cloud coverage and cloud radiative forcing with the DTR is mainly apparent for low clouds. Background DTR variability on daily time scales is as large as the DTR signal discussed by Travis et al. We find no significant decrease of DTR in the climate model simulations, if contrails are included. The balance of evidence from our results does not support the proposed large effect of contrails on the diurnal temperature development. ...|$|R

So it can be useful to investigate it deeply. The study focuses on the indicators of the quality in social services, because assessing the quality by inspectors is based on them. There are the first analyses of the past inspections nowadays. They point out the heterogenity {{in the evaluation of}} the indicators as the components of the evaluated standards. The caseless judgement of the poor quality of social services can cause farreaching consequences to them. Many of providers are occupied with solving financial situation, creating standards of quality and solving everyday matters in so far they can devote their time to this theme marginally or not at all. In the empirical part of this work, there has been used a <b>grouded</b> theory, which has been based on qualitative interviews identifying crucial factors of the surveyed area. Cumulating and lingering problems away can mean a wide range of the negative impact for the organization: As from a negative attitude to the philosophy of quality, spreading a bad reputation of the inspection and ends with frustrated employees,, or even their leaving social services.

It was examined the case study of the city Tupa – Sao Paulo’s State- which was divided in two distinct phases: phase 1 – between June and October of 2001, characterized by the presence of landfill and; phase 2 – from November of 2001 to May of 2002, characterized {{by the beginning of the}} implementation of selective collection and recycling and gradual dump <b>grouding.</b> The procedure for the capture of the insects was made with ten traps made with two-liter plastics bottles placed in houses and trees around the landfill. As an attractive, 400 mL of spill from sugar cane was used and replaced weekly. In both phases of the research was observed that the most frequent and constant family was the Calliphoridae. There was a positive correlation before the selective collection between the number of Calliphoridae and the rainfall (0, 638) and the number of muscideos and the average temperature (0, 605). After the collection program started, this correlation was not observed any more. To conclude, the program of selective collection implanted in the city of Tupa resulted in a decrease in the frequency of diptera. The analysis of the Callidoridae and Muscidae float demonstrated to be an efficient indicator of the environmental quality...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{considerable}} scholarly {{attention has been}} devoted to the history of leisure and recreation in pre- and early British industrial society. Much of this work has focussed on the implications of economic and social development for the extent and character of the sports people played in their leisure hours. * The story is still far from complete, however. The present study attempts to add another piece to the puzzle by examing the development of sport in the city of Glasgow during the period 1850 - 1914. It would be impossible for one person to read and evaluate in detail the source material available for the whole spectrum of nineteenth century sport in Glasgow. Accordingly, seven of Glasgow's most popular sports have been selected for study : swiirutiing, golf, athletics, cricket, rugby, football and cycling. The study attempts to describe, assess and account f or the trend in s porting activity in Glasgow {{during the first half of}} the nineteenth century. It then examines the emergence of the more modern patterns of s port which began in the second half of the nineteenth century. As well as describing the extent of modern sporting developments, its main concern is with asking tne question what were the most important forces which influenced such patterns. In particular, which social <b>grouDs</b> were involved in organised sporting activites, why they were involved, what form did their involvement take and what were the effects of their involvement on the development of sport in general...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{results of}} the response of an artificial ice sheet-ice shelf system to sliding pertubations concerning the grounding line migration. For that subsequent periodic basal slid- ing pertubations are applied on different time scales and geometries using the finite difference full-Stokes model TIM-FD 3. All experiments are performed on a fixed grid. To obtain steady state geometries for the periodic sliding experiments various initial geometries including simple slabs and idealised ones are tested with horizontal resolutions from 10. 0, 5. 0, 2. 5 to 1. 25 km to investigate resolution dependencies. The pertubations experiments are examined with three geometries obtained from the geometry spin-up in comparison to applied pertubations on the geometry given by the high-resolution ice model Elmer/Ice. Most pertubation experiments are executed with a grid resolution of 2. 5 km and only some with 1. 25 km due to computational expenses. The experiments are {{a continuation of the}} ice 2 sea MISMIP 3 D benchmark puplished by Pat- tyn et al. (2013) at which TIM-FD 3 participated. Comparability is given as the geometry of Elmer/Ice was also used for MISMIP 3 D. Results of the basal sliding experiments indicate that not all experiments show neutral equilib- riums in subsequent basal sliding pertubations. Thus, the grounding line migrates downstream or upstream depending on the position in comparison to the <b>grouding</b> line of Elmer/Ice which appears to be reversible on all resolutions and pertubations. Furthermore the tested steady state geometries show a strong dependency on the horizontal resolution and the chosen initial geometry. They do not converge to the same steady state. This strengthens the importance of the initial geometry for further pertubation experiments...|$|R
