500|$|In November 1811, a {{messenger}} brought news to Kentucky of former Kentucky Attorney General Joseph Hamilton Daveiss's {{death at the}} Battle of Tippecanoe, amplifying Kentuckians' outcry for war with the British and Indians. In anticipation of a federal call for volunteers, Scott published messages in the state's newspapers in February and April 1812 whipping up support for the impending war effort. By the end of July, the state's quota of 5,500 volunteers had been met. On August 14, 1812, Scott greeted two regiments of soldiers at the governor's mansion just prior to their muster at Georgetown. He hobbled among the soldiers with his crutch, then turned and hammered it against the mansion's steps and was heard to mutter [...] "If it hadn't been for you, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> with the boys myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Earnhardt's only win of the 1992 season came at Charlotte, in the Coca-Cola 600, {{ending a}} 13-race win streak by Ford teams. Earnhardt {{finished}} a career-low 12th in the {{points for the}} second time in his career, and the only time he had finished that low since joining RCR. He still made the trip to the annual Awards Banquet with Rusty Wallace but did not have the best seat in the house. Wallace stated he and Earnhardt had to sit on the backs of their chairs to see, and Earnhardt said, [...] "This sucks, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> hunting." [...] At the end of the year, longtime crew chief Kirk Shelmerdine left to become a driver. Andy Petree took over as crew chief.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} about Armageddon Sebastian spoke {{of how much}} The Memphis Album still influences his music, [...] "I headed across to Memphis and was very inspired by the music scene there. I got to work with some people who were instrumental in shaping the careers of artists who heavily influence me. Artists like Otis Redding, Sam & Dave and Sam Cooke. Being entrenched {{in that sort of}} environment really caused me to go 'You know what dude. Do what you want to do. Do what comes natural to you'." [...] Sebastian said it was a turning point for him, adding, [...] "From that Memphis thing a few years ago it's always going to start with me being true to who I want to be and what I enjoy singing." [...] Sebastian feels his soul roots remained even when he delved into electro dance music with the single [...] "Who's That Girl" [...] from his previous album, explaining it was an old school Sam Cooke type of melody, with modern lyrics, over a dance track. He said, [...] "I had that melody, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> so many ways with it. I could have produced an old-school soul song, but I went towards what you hear on the radio." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then, {{you know}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> mamma <b>go,</b> {{but it would}} bore her; or <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> a maid <b>go,</b> but that would bore me; and so I've decided to have you go." ...|$|R
2500|$|Bollea is a Christian. Bollea {{has spoken}} about {{his faith in}} his life saying, [...] " [...] leaned on my religion. I was saved when I was 14. I {{accepted}} Christ as my savior. He died on the cross and paid for my sins... <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>went</b> [...] the wrong way. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> self-destructed, but <b>I</b> took the high road".|$|R
6000|$|... 'Child, {{art thou}} there? It is well; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> scarce <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> without bidding thee farewell,' {{he said in}} his sweet voice; 'thou, the dear {{companion}} of my loneliness.' ...|$|R
60|$|She came {{straight}} {{to me in}} a moment--just as easily as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> to her myself if I had tried.|$|E
6000|$|... "There are {{different}} ways of thinking," [...] said his father. [...] "Church {{was the only place}} where <b>I</b> <b>COULD</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> that St. Barnabas' Day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I wish,' resumed my wife, {{after a long}} silence, 'that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> {{down into}} {{the country for a}} whole year, and lived with Agnes!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> got up the rope, Holland, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> up straight, as you did, without {{stopping}} {{for a bit}} to take breath. You don't look so very strong, either." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} I have not noticed?" [...] smiled the stranger, [...] "a gallant, {{handsome}} lad, and clever. You {{love him and}} he loves you. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> away without knowing it was well with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{always comes}} on unlucky days!' she said. 'I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> made it <b>go</b> off better. Thank {{you for taking}} all the trouble.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course there}} was no chance for me if he wanted her. But why didn't they speak out, so that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> away? Oh, Mr. Masters!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A 'ouse on the Leas. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> there. Only I didn't. I didn't care to. I didn't {{know what}} to say. I wanted to come and tell you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> {{through another}} meeting with Mr. Pilkington," [...] said Jill. [...] "It wasn't his fault, {{and he was}} quite justified, but {{what he said about}} Uncle Chris rather hurt." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> just <b>gone</b> {{out with}} tape {{machines}} or 50 keyboards {{or whatever and}} recreated {{the sound of the}} record, but I'm much more interested in the challenge of having 4 musicians interpret what was initially composed by one person on a computer ... The record and the shows are quite different. â€”Reznor in a 1991 interview ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Colonel, {{the general}} {{was good enough}} to {{recommend}} me. Of course I am glad in one way, but I am sorry that it has put me out of the regiment that I have been brought up with. But, of course, it was necessary, for <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> over other men's heads in it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You are {{a little}} fool,' said his father. 'If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> let you <b>go,</b> and kept your eleven {{brothers}} at home, {{it would have been}} better for me in my old age.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I wish I hadn't fought {{quite so}} hard, Pertusal, for I {{had hoped that}} I had {{altogether}} escaped recognition. I thought that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> through the campaign without anyone suspecting who I was." ...|$|E
60|$|Worthy old girl! <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> {{and kissed}} her had she not been a little too old, too fat, and too red-faced; her sensible, truthful words seemed so wholesome, contrasted with the morbid illusions of her daughter.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not asking}} it of the BANK," [...] said Barker, with a smile, [...] "for <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> {{to the bank}} for it. But as this was {{something}} between us, I am asking you, Stacy, as my old partner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Much better, Malcolm. I {{feel that}} I {{can go on}} now, whereas before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> much further if all Cumberland's cavalry had been close behind. How far are you {{thinking}} of going? I don't think my horse can carry double much further. Poor beast, he has had as short rations as his master, {{and was on the}} move all last night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I {{must carry}} her before me. We will shift my saddle {{a little farther}} back, and strap a couple of rugs in front of it, {{so as to make}} a {{comfortable}} seat for her. There is no doubt she {{will not be able to}} ride again, by herself. I am sure that, after my first day's riding, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> on again for anything.|$|R
6000|$|... "At least," [...] thought Lord Kilcullen to himself, as he good-humouredly {{shook hands}} with his father at the {{termination}} of the interview--"I have not done so badly, for those infernal dogs will be silenced, and I shall get the money. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> back without that. I can {{go on with the}} marriage, or not, as I may choose, hereafter. It won't be a bad speculation, however." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your schoolfellows did not, Norris," [...] Mr. Richards said. [...] "I don't {{think that}} I did, even at first; {{a few hours}} {{afterwards}} I almost knew you were innocent, and had you not run away <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> far to prove it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I expect he {{is through}} them before this," [...] Wilson said confidently. [...] "I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> with him; {{but of course}} {{it would not have been}} any good. It is a {{beautiful}} night--isn't it, Miss Hannay?--and there is scarcely any dew falling." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am awfully {{glad to see}} you back," [...] Wilson said, shaking him warmly by the hand. [...] "I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> with you. Two {{together}} {{does not}} seem so bad, but I should not like to start out by myself as you did." ...|$|E
6000|$|Oh, {{my friend}} John, {{but it was}} butcher work. Had I not been nerved by {{thoughts}} of other dead, and of the living over whom hung such a pall of fear, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> on. <b>I</b> tremble and tremble even yet, though till all was over, God be thanked, my nerve did stand. Had I not seen the repose in the first place, and the gladness that stole over it just ere the final dissolution came, as realization that the soul <b>had</b> been won, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> further with my butchery. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> endured the horrid screeching as the stake drove home, the plunging of writhing form, and lips of bloody foam. I should have fled in terror and left my work undone. But it is over! And the poor souls, I can pity them now and weep, as I think of them placid each in her full sleep of death for a short moment ere fading. For, friend John, hardly had my knife severed the head of each, before the whole body began to melt away and crumble into its native dust, as though the death that should have come centuries ago had at last assert himself and say at once and loud, [...] "I am here!" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> wished we <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> away at {{once and}} heard no more, and so must, I think, the young preacher have felt; but he was {{surrounded}} with compliments. M. Voiture {{said he had never}} heard 'so early nor so late a sermon;' while others thronged up with their compliments.|$|R
6000|$|... "One {{can never}} be sure of a woman," [...] he answered. [...] "And {{it would have been}} so difficult. There was a girl down in Scotland, one of the village girls. It wasn't {{anything}} really. We had just been children together. But they all thought I <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> away to make my fortune so as to come back and marry her--even my mother. It would have looked so mean if after getting on I had married a fine London lady. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> home again." ...|$|R
6000|$|There {{was really}} {{something}} remarkable about the exhaustiveness of this [...] "conversation at the shoemaker's." [...] I should think the book {{must have been}} written by someone who suffered from corns. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> to a German shoemaker with this book and have talked the man's head off.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is so hard}} to tell you, Lucy. I {{have sent}} to you in good faith, and in love. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> to you,--only for the old vulture, who would not have let us had a word in peace. I do see him--constantly. And I love him dearly." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{stopped the}} discussion. Mr. Bruff {{collected}} his papers, {{looking a little}} exhausted by the demands which our conversation had made on him. I took up my bag-full of precious publications, feeling as if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> on talking for hours. We proceeded in silence to Lady Verinder's room.|$|E
6000|$|Agatha {{gave him}} a quiet, {{friendly}} look. [...] "It's lucky I have you to help, because <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> far alone. I've studied Nature's laws in the laboratory, but in the bush she works on another scale. There's a difference between a blow-pipe flame and the subterranean fires. Now if I don't find the ore, it will be some comfort to know that I have properly tried." [...] She glanced at her wrist-watch and got up. [...] "It is later than I thought!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Esther," [...] he returned, [...] "it is indeed. I am just so near disgrace as {{that those}} who are put in {{authority}} over me (as the catechism goes) would far rather be without me than with me. And they are right. Apart from debts and duns and all such drawbacks, I am not fit even for this employment. I have no care, no mind, no heart, no soul, but for one thing. Why, if this bubble hadn't broken now," [...] he said, tearing the letter he had written into fragments and moodily casting them away, by driblets, [...] "how <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> abroad? I must have been ordered abroad, but how <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone?</b> How <b>could</b> <b>I,</b> with my experience of that thing, trust even Vholes unless I was at his back!" ...|$|R
60|$|London {{was in a}} ferment. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> {{wished to}} <b>go</b> into details, to {{describe}} in crisp, burning sentences the panic that swept like a tornado through a million homes. A little encouragement, the slightest softening of the editorial austerity and the thing would have been done. But no. Brevity. That was the cry. Brevity. Let us on.|$|R
