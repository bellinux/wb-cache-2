40|$|Green potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) tubers are {{rejected}} by the processing industry. Therefore their amount should be reduced to minimum. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the reduction of greening of new French fry varieties in experiments conducted from 1998 to 2001 on ridge qualities like geometry and the compression and crumbling degree of the loose soil in the ridge. The experiments were mainly carried out on the experimental husbandry farm Westmaas on a Calcaric Fluvisol having a clay content of ca. 200 g kg¿ 1. French fry potato varieties used were Agria and Fambo, whereas Bintje was used as a reference. Row spacings were 0. 75 m (30 in.) and 0. 90 m (36 in.). Net ridge size was determined by the internal height (distance between the plate and the top of the ridge) and by the width of the top of the ridge combined with planting near the surface of the plate. For the traditional French fry variety Bintje a reduction in greening was achieved by ridges having a gross size of 0. 06 ¿ 0. 07 m 2. New French fry potato varieties like Agria and Fambo, however, are characterized by higher yields, larger cluster widths and longer tubers than Bintje. These properties favor the <b>greening</b> <b>of</b> <b>tubers</b> and require adjustment of the ridge geometry. Increase of the internal height and of the top width were found to be crucial to reduce <b>greening</b> <b>of</b> <b>tubers</b> to minimum. An increase of the top width of standard 0. 75 m ridges from 0. 15 ¿ 0. 18 to 0. 25 m combined with an internal height of 0. 18 ¿ 0. 20 m was realized by the so-called plateau ridges. This ridge type required ca. 0. 04 m deeper seedbed than the depth of the seedbed for standard 0. 75 m ridges. Without deeper loosening of the seedbed such larger ridges could also be realized by an increase of row spacing to 0. 90 m. Net yields of new French fry varieties of plateau and 0. 90 m ridges were generally similar or higher than the yields of standard 0. 75 m ridges with the same internal height. With 0. 90 m ridges over-sizing occurred sometimes. Greening of new varieties of French fry potatoes was reduced to minimum by the new knowledge on ridge geometry: an increase of the internal ridge height to 0. 18 ¿ 0. 20 m, a top width to 0. 25 m and reduction of cracking by relatively coarse, non-compressed ridges...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, commercially grown {{potatoes}} are hilled {{in the production}} cycle between [...] emergence and closure of the canopy. Hilling is usually accomplished with disks, sweep shovels, or similar tools that lift soil from between rows and deposit it beside {{and on top of}} the row. Reasons for hilling may include: improved weed control, improved drainage, minimization of <b>greening</b> <b>of</b> <b>tubers,</b> and raising of soil temperatures. Proper management of each of these factors may result in an increase in quality and quantity of tuber yield. Negative aspects of hilling have also been noted. Saffigna et al. (1976) reported that water distribution was uneven under potato hills, resulting in uneven availability of water to plants and increased loss of fertilizer due to leaching. Hilling operations may also damage potato plants, and significant reductions in yield are [...] known to result from hilling and other types of cultivation (Nelson and Giles, 1986). Many commercial growers wait until vines are 12 or more inches tall before hilling. This scheduling is preferred because at this time the danger of covering plants is minimal. However, the vines of larger plants may sustain greater damage from hilling than smaller plants. Also, the possibility of damaging roots and stolons increases as the plants increase in size, so there may be advantages to hilling when plants are younger and smaller. Four different treatments including variations in time of hilling and height of hill were compared with no-hilling on four varieties of potato in the 1988 and 1989 growing seasons. This report contains a preliminary summary of data collected from these studies...|$|E

The {{research was}} conducted in the experimental area of Department of Agronomy UNICENTRO in Guarapuava - PR. The objective was to evaluate the additive effects of fungicides fluazinam and metiram + pyraclostrobin in plant development, production and post harvest quality of potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.). In addition to establishing a methodology for determination of leaf area based on the estimated regression equation for the length and width of leaves. We considered two stages, the first step performed in a completely randomized design with 5 treatments and 4 replicates, of which the T 1 is the witness with fluazinam, T 2, T 3, T 4, T 5 are treated with different doses of pyraclostrobin + metiram furrow and in lumps.

The effects of chemicals known to interact with chloroplast development and function were observed in changes in greening and solanine production. Chloramphenicol, a known inhibitor of chloroplast development in leaf systems, was found to block both greening and solanine synthesis in tuber discs whilst inhibitors of photosynthesis, Monuron and Simazine only blocked solanine production. Gibberellic acid and Nicotinic acid, which are thought to affect sterol metabolism directly, were also found to interfer with solanine production. The effect of potassium status of the soil on the <b>greening</b> potential <b>of</b> the <b>tubers</b> was assessed. Although large differences in edaphic potassium produced only small endogenous differences, those with higher potassium levels produced greater amounts of both chlorophyll and solanine. However, no positive correlation could be proved between endogenous potassium levels and greening in 17 potato varieties. The relevance of these results to the control <b>of</b> <b>greening</b> potential via cultural practices is discussed. The possible ways in which chlorophyll synthesis and solanine production are linked are assessed with particular emphasis on {{the ways in which}} developing chloroplast in light exposed tubers could support increased levels of solanine production.

40|$|A {{sampling}} protocol for detecting latent infections in potato tubers stored in bins, {{based on the}} preparation of standard samples <b>of</b> 200 <b>tubers,</b> was tested for reliability. Bins <b>of</b> <b>tubers</b> were manually distributed in windrows and 1 % <b>of</b> <b>tubers</b> were replaced with painted tubers, simulating tubers with latent infections. The painted tubers were distributed in windrows with clustered, regular and random distribution. Tubers were harvested and transferred to bins. Each bin {{was considered to be}} divided into layers 15 cm in depth, and 20 tubers were collected along an X-shaped sampling path of each bin layer. A simulated sampling approach was applied to obtain 10 bulk samples (200 tubers) for each kind <b>of</b> <b>tuber</b> distribution. The number <b>of</b> marked <b>tubers,</b> the mean percentage and the standard deviation of the bulk samples of each group was computed. The results confirmed that the sampling design adopted in this study ensured preparation of representative bulk samples. In fact, marked tubers were effectively detected; the observed mean percentages <b>of</b> marked <b>tubers</b> were acceptable in value, even though an overestimate of the true percentage was generally obtained. The percentage <b>of</b> marked <b>tubers</b> was underestimated in 50 % of cases when considering a regular distribution <b>of</b> marked <b>tubers.</b> However, it was never underestimated when considering the clustered distribution, which is most representative of the situation for tubers with latent infections...|$|R

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of edible vaccines produced in potato tubers was examined in mice. Transgenic plants {{were developed by}} Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. The antigen selected was the non-toxic B subunit of the Escherichia coli enterotoxin (recLT-B). A synthetic gene coding for recLT-B was made and optimised for expression in potato tubers and accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum. Introduction of this gene under control of the tuber-specific patatin promoter in potato plants resulted {{in the production of}} functional, i. e. Gm 1 -binding, recLT-B pentamers in tubers. Selected tubers containing about 13 g of recLT-B per gram fresh weight were used for immunisation. Subcutaneous immunisation with an extract <b>of</b> recLT-B <b>tubers</b> yielded high antibody titres in serum that were similar to those obtained with bacterial recLT-B. The {{efficacy of}} oral administration <b>of</b> recLT-B <b>tubers</b> was determined by measuring mucosal and systemic immune responses in naive and primed mice. Animals were primed by subcutaneous injection of an extract <b>of</b> recLT-B <b>tuber</b> plus adjuvant. Naive and primed mice were fed 5 g <b>of</b> <b>tubers</b> (~ 65 g of recLT-B) or were intubated intragastrically with 0. 4 ml <b>of</b> <b>tuber</b> extract (~ 2 g of recLT-B). In naive mice, feeding recLT-B <b>tubers</b> or intubation <b>of</b> <b>tuber</b> extract did not induce detectable anti-LT antibody titres. In primed animals, however, oral immunisation resulted in significant anti-LT IgA antibody responses in serum and faeces. Intragastric intubation <b>of</b> <b>tuber</b> extract revealed higher responses than feeding <b>of</b> <b>tubers.</b> These results indicate clearly that functional recLT-B can be produced in potato tubers, that this recombinant protein is immunogenic and that oral administration thereof elicits both systemic and local IgA responses in parentally primed, but not naive, animals...|$|R
