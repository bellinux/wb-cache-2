30|$|In {{attempts}} to eliminate undesirable solvents, replacement strategies often seek structurally related compounds not yet {{covered by the}} legislative and regulatory measures usually required to force action in this respect. Thus benzene, since its formal recognition as a carcinogen in the mid-twentieth century, is generally replaced by toluene [14, 15]. Similarly the Montreal protocol has restricted the use of carbon tetrachloride since 1989 because of its role in depleting the ozone layer [16, 17]. Typically the halogenated solvents chloroform and dichloromethane (DCM) are now used instead. It is important to emphasise that these measures {{have proven to be}} short sighted with respect to increasingly strict chemical controls worldwide. Toluene is in fact suspected of damaging the unborn child and of organ damage through prolonged exposure [18, 19]. Chloroform and DCM are likely to be carcinogenic to humans according to the World Health Organization IARC evaluations [15]. In addition, DCM, even as a short-lived <b>halogenated</b> <b>substance</b> has now been shown to be ozone depleting as well [20].|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Despite {{the large}} amount of work carried out for the identifica-tion of pyrolytic {{products}} of fire retardant polymers, there is still lack of reliable MS data on <b>halogenated</b> <b>substances.</b> The development of toxic halogenated products mostly occurs during the process of pyrolysis, burning or recycling and they originate from the use of halogenated fire retardants. 1, 2 -Bis(2, 4, 6 -tribromophenoxy) ethane is a common fire retardant used in acrylonitrile– butadiene–styrene terpolymers for computer housing. Its pyrolysis products (brominated vinyl phenyl ethers, brominated alkyl phenyl ethers, brominated diaryl ethers, polybrominated dibenzodioxins) from a 340 C pyrolysis have been identified by GC/MS and their mass spectra are presented and discussed.

40|$|Anthropogenic <b>halogenated</b> <b>substances</b> {{cause the}} ozone hole above Antarctica through {{catalytic}} ozone destruction and {{depletion of the}} stratospheric ozone layer, which shields the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. Their emissions were regulated through the Montreal Protocol in 1989. Since {{the beginning of the}} 21 st century, the amount of chlorine and bromine in the stratosphere from long-lived ozone depleting substances (ODS) has been decreasing and stratospheric ozone has started to increase slowly. Under these circumstances the importance of natural <b>halogenated</b> <b>substances</b> for atmospheric composition and chemistry will increase in the future. Trace-gases with atmospheric lifetimes of less than half a year belong to the so-called very short-lived substances(VSLS). The most important bromine containing VSLS bromoform (CHBr 3, 17 days lifetime) and dibromomethane (CH 2 Br 2, 150 days) from marine sources currently contribute about 25 % to the observed stratospheric bromine loading. In addition, the short-lived VSLS methyl iodide (CH 3 I, 3. 5 days) contributes to stratospheric iodine levels. Sulfur containing compounds, such as dimethylsulfide (DMS, 1 day), also influence stratospheric ozone. Sulfur supplies the stratospheric aerosol layer, which amplifies heterogeneous chemical ozone depleting reactions under high chlorine levels. DMS is a potential source of sulfur to the stratosphere. VSLS are naturally produced in the oceans by phytoplankton, macro algae, and photochemistry. They are primarily transported to the stratosphere with deep convection in the tropics and mainly enter the stratosphere over the Pacific warm pool in boreal winter and the Asian monsoon region in boreal summer. Major uncertainties still exist with respect to the oceanic emissions of halogenated VSLS from the Indian Ocean and their stratospheric entrainment through the Asian monsoon circulation. This thesis investigates the emissions of VSLS from the Indian Ocean and their transport to the stratosphere with novel combinations of data and modeling...|$|R

It focuses on a series of different N-alkoxy hindered amines (NOR), azoalkanes (AZO) of the general formula R'-N.

These nitrogen-containing flame retardants mainly exhibit self-extinguishing properties for polypropylene and polyethylene films or even in some cases for polypropylene moldings, polyurethane adhesives, and polystyrene. In addition, their performance in combination with various conventional flame retardant classes is discussed. Contrary to other nitrogen-containing flame retardants, such as melamines, the presented nitrogen-based flame retardants are effective at very low additive levels (< 1. wt%), they do not weaken the mechanical or physical properties of the host polymer, and after structural optimization, they are likely to meet the criteria for sustainable production and development...|$|R

30|$|As for {{the surface}} treatment, the TR soles {{chemical}} treatment {{is applied to}} the substrate to provide uniformity, allowing and increasing the cohesive strength of the adhesive joint [6]. This treatment allows the chemically modification of the surface to be bonded. In the footwear industry, the most commonly used chemical treatment is via <b>halogenated</b> <b>substances.</b> During production, PU soles are coated with a release agent to facilitate its removal from the mould and the footwear industry uses more than one treatment, starting with mechanical carding which is followed by application of a primer. On the leather based uppers, mechanical treatment is applied followed by the application of a primer. This treatment creates mechanical roughening on the substrate surface by increasing the contact area and therefore increasing the number of possible linkages in the interface between the adhesive and the substrate. In the footwear industry, the mechanical treatment is the most widely used, with the carding performed using the sandpaper [6]. The primer also works as a surface pre-treatment and consists in a polymer solution in organic solvents. This composition is related with the adhesive, but with low viscosity, forming a thin layer on the substrate. The primer, when dry, provides a very strong bond with the adhesive, requiring compatibility of the primer with the adhesive [6]. In the footwear industry, various methods are used depending on the application operation. In the case of bonding upper/sole, the method of application by brush is used.|$|R

Until recently, these enzymes have been isolated only from bacteria living in contaminated environments. In this report we describe cloning of the dehalogenase gene dhmA from Mycobacterium avium subsp. avium N 85 isolated from swine mesenteric lymph nodes. The dhmA gene has a G+C content of 68. 21 % and codes for a polypeptide that is 301 amino acids long {{and has a}} calculated molecular mass of 34. 7 kDa. The molecular masses of DhmA determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by gel permeation chromatography are 34. 0 and 35. 4 kDa, respectively. Many residues essential for the dehalogenation reaction are conserved in DhmA; the putative catalytic triad consists of Asp 123, His 279, and Asp 250, and the putative oxyanion hole consists of Glu 55 and Trp 124. Trp 124 {{should be involved in}} substrate binding and product (halide) stabilization, while the second halide-stabilizing residue cannot be identified from a comparison of the DhmA sequence with the sequences of three dehalogenases with known tertiary structures. The haloalkane dehalogenase DhmA shows broad substrate specificity and good activity with the priority pollutant 1, 2 -dichloroethane. DhmA is significantly less stable than other currently known haloalkane dehalogenases. This study confirms that a hydrolytic dehalogenase is present in the facultative pathogen M. avium.

40|$|Very short lived <b>halogenated</b> <b>substances</b> (VSLH) are of {{importance}} for the transport of reactive halogens to the troposphere and lower stratosphere, whereas molecular halogens are of specific importance to the Marine Boundary Layer (MBL). This thesis describes the field deployment of a ground based gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) in the Canadian sub-Arctic for the determination of VSLH in seawater/sea-ice and air {{with a view to}} identify dominant sources to the MBL in the region. MBL mixing ratios of VSLH were determined from a surface site (55. 28 °N, 77. 77 °W) on the south east of Hudson Bay,(Kuujjuarapik, Canada) during the 19 th - 27 th of February. Elevated mixing ratios of the Volatile Organic Iodine Compounds (VOIC) coincided with airmasses reaching the ground site that had previously transected regions of open water in the Bay (between 10 – 200 km away), suggesting leads/polynyas are the dominant source of VOIC within the region. This observation is supported by laboratory experiments conducted with artificial sea ice in a cold chamber (School of Earth and Environment, Leeds University) in which physico-chemical properties of the hypersaline brine, sea-ice and the underlying seawater were measured to quantify the vertical transport of a comprehensive range of volatile organic iodinated compounds (VOICs) at air temperatures of - 3 and - 14 oC. The results suggest that VOIC gas transfer velocities from diffusion through the sea-ice alone are at least  60 times lower at - 3 ºC than gas exchange from leads and polynas during the winter (assuming a sea-ice fractional coverage of 0. 1). This has significant implications for in situ VOIC losses within the brine from chlorination, hydrolysis and photolysis processes and it is unlikely that measurable concentrations of VOICs would survive vertical transport from the underlying seawater to the surface sea ice quasi-liquid layer. Further laboratory work within this thesis suggests that gaseous I 2 evolution from the oxidation of iodide in the world’s oceans by atmospheric ozone is a viable source of iodine to the MBL, but its strongly constrained by the iodide and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content of the surface ocean. ...|$|R

40|$|Stratospheric ozone is {{expected}} to increase during the 21 st century as the abundance of <b>halogenated</b> ozone-depleting <b>substances</b> decrease to 1960 values. However, climate change will likely alter this "recovery" of stratospheric ozone by changing stratospheric temperatures, circulation, and abundance of reactive chemical species. Here we quantity the contribution of different mechanisms to changes in upper stratospheric ozone from 1960 to 2100 in the Goddard Earth Observing System Chemistry-Climate Model (GEOS CCM), using multiple linear regression analysis applied to simulations using either Alb or A 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) scenarios. In both these scenarios upper stratospheric ozone has a secular increase over the 21 st century. For the simulation using the Alb GHG scenario, this increase is determined by the decrease in halogen amounts and the greenhouse gas induced cooling, with roughly equal contributions from each mechanism. There is a larger cooling in the simulation using the A 2 GHG scenario, but also enhanced loss from higher NOy and HOx concentrations, which nearly offsets the increase due to cooler temperatures. The resulting ozone evolutions are similar in the A 2 and Alb simulations. The response of ozone due to feedbacks from temperature and HOx changes, related to changing halogen concentrations, are also quantified using simulations with fixed halogen concentrations...|$|R

Here, we investigate the contribution of natural oceanic VSLS emissions to the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) and their transport into the free troposphere (FT) over the tropical West Pacific. The study concentrates on bromoform, dibromomethane and methyl iodide measured on ship and aircraft during the SHIVA (Stratospheric Ozone: Halogen Impacts in a Varying Atmosphere) campaign in the South China and Sulu seas in November  2011. Elevated oceanic concentrations for bromoform, dibromomethane and methyl iodide of on average 19. 9, 5. 0 and 3. 8  pmol L − 1, in particular close to Singapore and to the coast of Borneo, with high corresponding oceanic emissions of 1486, 405 and 433  pmol m − 2  h − 1 respectively, characterise this tropical region as a strong source of these compounds. Atmospheric mixing ratios in the MABL were unexpectedly relatively low with 2. 08, 1. 17 and 0. 39  ppt for bromoform, dibromomethane and methyl iodide. We use meteorological and chemical ship and aircraft observations, FLEXPART trajectory calculations and source-loss estimates to identify the oceanic VSLS contribution to the MABL and to the FT. Our {{results show that the}} well-ventilated MABL and intense convection led to the low atmospheric mixing ratios in the MABL despite the high oceanic emissions. Up to 45  % of the accumulated bromoform in the FT above the region originates from the local South China Sea area, while dibromomethane is largely advected from distant source regions and the local ocean only contributes 20  %.

A transient 1960 – 2100 simulation is analysed which follows the representative concentration pathway 6. 0 (RCP 6. 0) emissions scenario for the future. Tropical averaged (10 ° S– 10 ° N) TCO 3 values decrease from the 1970 s, reach a minimum around 2000 and return to their 1980 values around 2040, consistent with the use and emission of <b>halogenated</b> ozone-depleting <b>substances</b> (ODSs), and their later controls under the Montreal Protocol. However, when the ozone column is subdivided into three partial columns (PCO 3) that cover the upper stratosphere (PCO 3 US), lower stratosphere (PCO 3 LS) and troposphere (PCO 3 T), {{significant differences in the}} temporal behaviour of the partial columns are seen. Modelled PCO 3 T values under the RCP 6. 0 emissions scenario increase from 1960 to 2000 before remaining approximately constant throughout the 21 st century. PCO 3 LS values decrease rapidly from 1960 to 2000 and remain constant from 2000 to 2050, before gradually decreasing further from 2050 to 2100 and never returning to their 1980 s values.

Using a series of idealised UM-UKCA time-slice simulations with concentrations of well-mixed greenhouse gases (GHGs) and halogenated ODS species set to either year 2000 or 2100 levels, we examine the main processes that drive the PCO 3 responses in the three regions and assess how these processes change under different emission scenarios.

In {{addition}} to a reference simulation where anthropogenic <b>halogenated</b> ozone depleting <b>substances</b> (ODSs) and greenhouse gases (GHGs) vary with time, sensitivity simulations with either ODSs or GHGs concentrations fixed at 1960 levels were performed to disaggregate the drivers of projected ozone changes. These simulations were also {{used to assess the}} two distinct milestones of ozone returning to historical values (ozone return dates) and ozone no longer being influenced by ODSs (full ozone recovery). These two milestones are different. The date of ozone returning to historical values does not indicate complete recovery from ODSs in most cases, because GHG induced changes accelerate or decelerate ozone changes in many regions. In the upper stratosphere where GHG induced stratospheric cooling increases ozone, full ozone recovery has not likely occurred by 2100 while ozone returns to its 1980 or even 1960 levels well before (~ 2025 and 2040, respectively). In contrast, in the tropical lower stratosphere ozone decreases continuously from 1960 to 2100 due to projected increases in tropical upwelling, while by around 2040 it is already very likely that full recovery from the effects of ODSs has occurred, although ODS concentrations are still elevated by this date. In the lower midlatitude stratosphere the evolution differs from that in the tropics, and rather than a steady decrease of ozone, first a decrease of ozone is simulated between 1960 and 2000, which is then followed by a steady increase throughout the 21 st century...|$|R

Highest VSLS mixing ratios were found near the Mauritanian coast and close to Lisbon (Portugal). Air mass origins were calculated with 5 -day backward trajectories starting at the surface and at the boundary layer top. We identified predominantly air masses from the open North Atlantic with some coastal influence in the Mauritanian upwelling area, due to the prevailing NW winds. Maximum VSLS mixing ratios above the Mauritanian upwelling were 8. 92 ppt for bromoform, 3. 14 ppt for dibromomethane and 3. 29 ppt for methyl iodide, with an observed maximum diurnal variability up to 50 % for bromoform, 26 % for dibromomethane and 56 % for methyl iodide. A relationship {{was found between the}} marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) height and bromoform, dibromomethane and methyl iodide abundances. Lowest MABL heights above the Mauritanian upwelling area coincide with highest VSLS mixing ratios and vice versa above the open ocean. Significant high anti-correlations confirm this relationship for the whole cruise. We conclude that especially above oceanic upwelling systems MABL height variations are an important driver for VSLS mixing ratio variations and elevated atmospheric abundances and may explain the so far observed missing VSLS sources in this region...|$|R
40|$|This PhD thesis {{investigates the}} {{transport}} {{and distribution of}} short-lived <b>halogenated</b> organic <b>substances</b> in the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) in the Pacific Ocean. Short-lived halocarbons {{are one of the}} major groups of the ozone depleting substances as they provide a source for the active halogens which decrease ozone in the atmosphere. The TTL serves as the primary gateway of tropospheric air to enter the stratosphere. The air which enters the stratosphere is distributed all over the globe. Thus, the research on which tropospheric air masses go into the TTL, its structure and composition and the transport within is crucial. This thesis uses the UK Meteorological Office Lagrangian particle dispersion model NAME to (i) support the flight planning activities and achieve the multi aircraft coordination in CAST, CONTRAST, ATTREX 2014 campaigns, and (ii) quantify the amount and distribution of short-lived halocarbons in the TTL, and explain differences in these vertical distributions and transport characteristics. The halocarbons of interest are methyl iodide (CH 3 I), bromoform (CHBr 3) and dibromomethane (CH 2 Br 2). A new NAME procedure was developed and operated successfully to provide routine simulations and near real-time products suitable for guiding the CAST, CONTRAST and ATTREX aircraft in order to achieve their mission scientific objectives, and to make coordinated measurements. NAME was used post-campaign to analyse distribution of short-lived halocarbons in the TTL, identify their source regions and transport timescales. A new approach is proposed to investigate the TTL composition in terms of the boundary layer air influence, and subsequently quantify CH 3 I, CHBr 3 and CH 2 Br 2 by estimating their boundary layer and background contribution. The sums of these modelled estimates are in good agreement with the ATTREX 2014 and 2013 CH 3 I, CHBr 3 and CH 2 Br 2 observations. The quantification of the contribution of short-lived bromocarbons to the active bromine in the TTL was achieved, and the results lie within the range of the recent literature studies. The final focus of this thesis is on how well NAME represents the particle displacement via convection. Convection is the major transport pathway for the short-lived halocarbons to reach the TTL. The role of convection in transporting CH 3 I, CHBr 3 and CH 2 Br 2 to the TTL is assessed using the new convection scheme in NAME. A validation of the performance of this scheme is provided, showing that it yields improved and more realistic representation of the particle displacement via convection.

Estimates {{of the amount of}} VSLS transported into the stratosphere are highly uncertain and based on sporadic observations around the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) and on modeling studies which use prescribed emission scenarios to reproduce observed atmospheric concentrations. Actual measurements of VSLS emissions at the ocean surface have not been linked to the stratospheric halogen loading until now. Here we use observations of oceanic VSLS emissions in the western Pacific and an atmospheric Lagrangian transport model to estimate the direct contribution of bromoform (CHBr 3 ), and dibromomethane (CH 2 Br 2 ) to the stratospheric bromine loading. Our emission-based estimates of VSLS profiles provide the first link between observed oceanic emissions and in situ TTL measurements. The emission-based and observed profiles of CHBr 3 show good agreement, confirming the importance of the western Pacific as a source region. However, CH 2 Br 2 emission-based estimates are considerable smaller than current upper air observations as a result of relatively low western Pacific emissions. We estimate the relative importance of the highly variable emission rates and the surface to stratosphere transport for the contribution of the two bromocarbons to the stratospheric bromine budget. Our results show that stratospheric entrainment of bromine in form of VSLS or their degradation products is highly variable and that this variability is primarily linked to the variability of the observed sea-to-air flux.

40|$|Halogenated organic {{compounds}} are naturally {{produced in the}} ocean and emitted to the atmosphere. The <b>halogenated</b> very short-lived <b>substances</b> (VSLS), such as bromoform, have atmospheric lifetimes of {{less than half a}} year. When VSLS reach the stratosphere, they enhance ozone depletion and thus impact the climate. During boreal summer, the Asian monsoon circulation transfers air masses from the Asian troposphere to the global stratosphere. Still, the extent to which VSLS from the Indian Ocean contribute to the stratospheric halogen burden and their exact origin is unclear. Here we show that the monsoon circulation transports VSLS from the Indian Ocean to the stratosphere. During the research cruises SO 234 - 2 and SO 235 in July-August 2014 onboard RV SONNE, we measured oceanic and atmospheric concentrations of bromoform (tropical lifetime at 10 km = 17 days), dibromomethane (150 days) and methyl iodide (3. 5 days) in the subtropical and tropical West Indian Ocean and calculated their emission strengths. We use the Langrangian transport model FLEXPART driven by ERA-Interim meteorological fields to investigate the transport of oceanic emissions in the atmosphere. We analyze the direct contribution of observed bromoform emissions to the stratospheric halogen budget with forward trajectories. Furthermore, we investigate the connection between the Asian monsoon anticyclone and the oceanic source regions using backward trajectories. The West Indian Ocean is a strong source region of VSLS to the atmosphere and the monsoon transport is fast enough for bromoform to reach the stratosphere. However, the main source regions for the entrainment of oceanic air masses through the Asian monsoon anticyclone are the West Pacific and Bay of Bengal as well as the Arabian Sea. Our findings indicate that changes in emission or circulation in this area due to climate change can directly affect the stratospheric halogen burden and thus the ozone layer...|$|R
40|$|<b>Halogenated</b> Very Short-lived <b>Substances</b> (VSLS), such as bromoform, {{dibromomethane}} and methyl iodide, {{are naturally}} {{produced in the}} oceans and are involved in ozone depletion in the troposphere and the stratosphere. The effect of climate change on the oceanic emissions of these compounds is not well quantified. Based on present-day observed global oceanic and atmospheric concentrations, and historic and future data from three CMIP 5 models, past and future sea-to-air fluxes of these VSLS are calculated. The simulations are used to infer possible effects of projected changes of physical forcing on emissions in different oceanic regimes. CMIP 5 model output for 1979 – 2100 from the historical scenario and the RCP scenarios 2. 6 and 8. 5 are used as input data for the emission calculations. Of the parameters that have the main influence on the sea-to-air fluxes, the global sea surface temperatures show a steady increase during the twenty-first century, while the projected changes of sea surface wind speed is very small. The calculated emissions based on the historical CMIP 5 model runs (1979 – 2005) increased over the 26 year period and agree well with the emissions based on ERA-Interim data. The future sea-to-air fluxes of VSLS generally increase during the twenty-first century under the assumption of constant concentration fields in the ocean and atmosphere. The multi-model mean global emissions of bromoform increase by 29. 4 (9. 0) between 1986 and 2005 and 2081 – 2100 under RCP 8. 5 (2. 6) and dibromomethane and methyl iodide emissions increase by 23. 3 (6. 4) and 5. 5 (1. 5), respectively.

After sampling errors were recognized in the context of ISO 17025 as an important factor affecting the quality of an analytical result, the needs for consistency of data arising from the European Water Framework Directive 2000 / 60 /EC rendered enhancement of metrological knowledge in this step of the measurement chain more significant. This trial was the first national attempt to improve knowledge of the effect in natural river waters of sampling activity undertaken as part of regulatory monitoring. Of the 14 sampling teams that took part in the trial, all selected by the RBAs, three were not linked to an analytical team. The Epone sampling spot was selected because of its central location, because its rural characteristics are representative {{of the majority of the}} RBA sampling stations, and because it enabled more than 40 people to be brought together in a secure environment. The monitoring parameters selected were : pH, oxygen, temperature and conductivity (field parameters); and, suspended particulate matter (SPM), nitrites, orthophosphates, barium, di(ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), and one organic <b>halogenated</b> volatile (OHV) <b>substance,</b> tetrachloroethylene (parameters to be analyzed in a laboratory, also called non-field parameters). The aim of this study was to evaluate several sampling procedures, including standardized, to determine the variability induced by sampling operations in subsequent analytical processes. "Sampling activities" included sampling performance and external inputs (e. g., weather). individual field observations were also performed in order to understand the reasons for reference methods not being rigorously followed and to propose improvements that will make these methods more acceptable to sampling staff, and thus more reliable. This article focuses on the results obtained for non-field parameters and on the solutions that we developed to overcome the difficulties caused by a storm the day before the trial...|$|R
40|$|<b>Halogenated</b> very {{short-lived}} <b>substances</b> (VSLS) {{are expected}} to contribute significantly to the stratospheric halogen loading and therefore to the stratospheric ozone chemistry. Tropical waters and upwelling regions in the oceans {{have been identified as}} potentially important source regions for the naturally produced VSLS, such as volatile brominated and iodinated halocarbons. Our understanding of the transport of VSLS from the marine boundary surface into the stratosphere is crucial to estimate their contribution to stratospheric halogen loading. In particular, the chemical degradation, wet and dry deposition as well as their transport through the free troposphere up to the stratosphere play important roles in determining whether VSLS and their organic product gases are able to reach the stratosphere. In this study we investigate the VSLS emissions in the tropical East Atlantic and tropical West Pacific and their contribution to the stratospheric halogen loading. For this purpose we use the Lagrangian particle dispersion model FLEXPART, which simulates transport, small scale mixing, washout and photochemical decay of three VSLS (bromoform, dibromomethane and methyliodide). The transport simulations are based on the VSLS sea-to-air flux obtained from the tropical East Atlantic in May/June 2010 and from the tropical Western Pacific in October 2009. While relatively large brominated VSLS fluxes are found in the Mauritanian upwelling in the East Atlantic, the VSLS transport is most efficient in the Western Pacific atmosphere, a region characterized by a high convective activity throughout the year. We show, based on the evaluations for the two tropical campaigns that the peak emissions of brominated VSLS together with strong convective transport lead to significant abundances in the TTL, which are comparable to available upper air measurements. For methyliodide however the Western Pacific emission-based profiles are larger than observations, which suggests that existing measurements may not be representative and methyliodide could have a larger impact on the stratospheric halogen loading than assumed so far. Finally, we will relate the results of this paper also to past ship campaigns in the tropical Atlantic and to the recent SHIVA Sonne expedition to the South-China Sea during November 2011...|$|R
40|$|Emissions of <b>halogenated</b> very {{short-lived}} <b>substances</b> (VSLS) {{are poorly}} constrained. However, their inclusion in global models {{is required to}} simulate a realistic inorganic bromine (Br y) loading in both the troposphere, where bromine chemistry perturbs global oxidising capacity, and in the stratosphere, where {{it is a major}} sink for ozone (O 3). We have performed simulations using a 3 -D chemical transport model (CTM) including three top-down and a single bottom-up derived emission inventory of the major brominated VSLS bromoform (CHBr 3) and dibromomethane (CH 2 Br 2). We perform the first concerted evaluation of these inventories, comparing both the magnitude and spatial distribution of emissions. For a quantitative evaluation of each inventory, model output is compared with independent long-term observations at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) ground-based stations and with aircraft observations made during the NSF (National Science Foundation) HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO) project. For CHBr 3, the mean absolute deviation between model and surface observation ranges from 0. 22 (38 %) to 0. 78 (115 %) parts per trillion (ppt) in the tropics, depending on emission inventory. For CH 2 Br 2, the range is 0. 17 (24 %) to 1. 25 (167 %) ppt. We also use aircraft observations made during the 2011 Stratospheric Ozone: Halogen Impacts in a Varying Atmosphere (SHIVA) campaign, in the tropical western Pacific. Here, the performance of the various inventories also varies significantly, but overall the CTM is able to reproduce observed CHBr 3 well in the free troposphere using an inventory based on observed sea-to-air fluxes. Finally, we identify the range of uncertainty associated with these VSLS emission inventories on stratospheric bromine loading due to VSLS (Br y VSLS). Our simulations show Br y VSLS ranges from ~ 4. 0 to 8. 0 ppt depending on the inventory. We report an optimised estimate {{at the lower end of}} this range (~ 4 ppt) based on combining the CHBr 3 and CH 2 Br 2 inventories which give best agreement with the compilation of observations in the tropics...|$|R
40|$|Refrigerants are {{improved}} {{with the development}} of refrigeration and air conditioning industry. Because of the long-term use of chlorine-containing <b>halogenated</b> hydrocarbon <b>substances,</b> the ozone depletion and global warming become important issues around the world. Searching for refrigerants with low GWP (Global Warming Potential) and zero ODP (Ozone Depletion Potential) is urgent. HFC- 134 a used to be a widely used refrigerant with zero ODP. However, its high GWP of 1300 and long atmospheric lifetime of 14 years would cause the problem of global warming. Thus, for the sake of environment, the substitution of HFC- 134 a is imperative. In recent years, HFO- 1234 yf has been {{regarded as one of the}} widely used substitutions of HFC- 134 a because of low GWP of 4 and similar thermophysical properties to HFC- 134 a. However, its COP is slightly smaller than that of HFC- 134 a. In order to make better use of HFO- 1234 yf, some HFO- 1234 yf + HFCs or HFO- 1234 yf + HCs binary mixtures were proposed as alternative refrigerants. HFC- 152 a with low GWP of 140 and a short atmospheric lifetime of 1. 5 years was selected as component in refrigerant mixtures. The mixture HFO- 1234 yf + HFC- 152 a is a promising alternative refrigerant. Before the actual application of alternative refrigerants in the refrigeration and air conditioning systems, thermophysical properties of mixed refrigerants need to be carefully investigated. Knowledge of viscosity characteristics, as one of the major concerns in the study of the thermophysical properties of alternative refrigerants, has significant impact on heat transfer and pressure drop in the flow, and viscosity data with high accuracy are of considerable value in the calculation of heat transfer and fluid flow. Â Â Â Â Â Â Thus, in this work, the measurement of liquid viscosity of the mixture was carried out with a new type of gravitational capillary viscometer developed in our previous work. The liquid viscosity experimental system used in this paper consists of a gravitational capillary viscometer made of glass, a pressure vessel with sight glasses, a thermostatic bath system and a measurement system. The measurement system consists of a high accurate temperature measure system (the standard temperature uncertainty is less than 0. 011 K) and a high accurate pressure measure system (the standard pressure uncertainty is within 1. 4 kPa). The expanded uncertainty of dynamic viscosity was 1. 58 %. The reliability of the experimental apparatus has been validated with HFO- 1234 yf and the binary mixture HFC- 22 + HFC- 134 a (0. 7 + 0. 3, by mole fraction) in previous work. Based on this, the gravitational capillary viscometer was firstly calibrated with HCFC- 22, and then, the liquid viscosity data of the binary mixture HFO- 1234 yf + HFC- 152 a (0. 81 + 0. 19, by mole fraction) were given from 278. 15 K to 333. 15 K. Two most commonly used viscosity models based on the Andrade equation were used to correlate the experimental data of the mixture HFO- 1234 yf + HFC- 152 a (0. 81 + 0. 19, by mole fraction). The correlation results were discussed...|$|R
40|$|Oceanic {{emissions}} of <b>halogenated</b> very short-lived <b>substances</b> (VSLS) {{are expected to}} contribute significantly to the stratospheric halogen loading and therefore to ozone depletion. The amount of VSLS transported into the stratosphere is estimated based on in-situ observations around the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) and on modeling studies which mostly use prescribed global emission scenarios to reproduce observed atmospheric concentrations. In addition to upper-air VSLS measurements, direct observations of oceanic VSLS emissions are available along ship cruise tracks. Here we use such in-situ observations of VSLS emissions from the West Pacific and tropical Atlantic together with an atmospheric Lagrangian transport model to estimate the direct contribution of bromoform (CHBr 3), and dibromomethane (CH 2 Br 2) to the stratospheric bromine loading {{as well as their}} ozone depletion potential. Our emission-based estimates of VSLS profiles are compared to upper-air observations and thus link observed oceanic emissions and in situ TTL measurements. This comparison determines how VSLS emissions and transport in the cruise track regions contribute to global upper-air VSLS estimates. The West Pacific emission-based profiles and the global upper-air observations of CHBr 3 show a relatively good agreement indicating that emissions from the West Pacific provide an average contribution to the global CHBr 3 budget. The tropical Atlantic, although also being a CHBr 3 source region, is of less importance for global upper-air CHBr 3 estimates as revealed by the small emission-based abundances in the TTL. Western Pacific CH 2 Br 2 emission-based estimates are considerably smaller than upper-air observations {{as a result of the}} relatively low sea-to-air flux found in the West Pacific. Together, CHBr 3 and CH 2 Br 2 emissions from the West Pacific are projected to contribute to the stratospheric bromine budget with 0. 4 pptv Br on average and 2. 3 pptv Br for cases of maximum emissions through product and source gas injection. These relatively low estimates reveal that the tropical West Pacific, although characterized by strong convective transport, might overall contribute less VSLS to the stratospheric bromine budget than other regions as a result of only low CH 2 Br 2 and moderate CHBr 3 oceanic emissions...|$|R
30|$|Disinfectants are {{chemicals}} that {{are able to}} reduce the amount of germs on objects to be disinfected. They are regulated mainly in the EU Biocidal Products Regulation (BPR) 528 / 2012 [1]. They are used in several sectors by professional and non-professional users. The BPR separates disinfectants in five product types (Annex V): human hygiene, disinfectants and algaecides not intended for direct application to humans or animals, veterinary hygiene, food and feed area and drinking water [1]. In the professional sector, the use of disinfectants is very important to avoid infections, e.g. in hospitals or the food industry. The use of disinfectants in private homes by non-professional users however is intensely debated amongst scientists: In Germany, it is widely accepted that disinfectants should only be used by private persons if there are medical indications [2]. These might be infectious diseases of family members or if people in need of care are living in the household. The limitation of uses is due to the fact that disinfectants do not only inherit benefits but also might pose risks to humans and the environment [2]. Studies show that the use of disinfectants is only significantly reducing bacterial contamination in households if users follow a strict cleaning protocol [3, 4]. In a setting where households were not informed how to use a disinfectant, the prevalence of bacterial contamination was not reduced [3]. A study on the effects of antibacterial products on infectious disease symptoms showed that using antibacterial products did not result in a reduction of the primarily viral infectious disease symptoms [5]. Reports of resistances are often accompanied by reports of wrong uses or insufficient cleaning [6]. This may also cause cross-resistances to antibiotics [7]. For example, it is under discussion whether a resistance to benzalkonium chloride, a disinfectant, might lead to a resistance to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin [8]. For many disinfecting substances, data on possible cross-resistances is not available; and for this reason, it is unclear which active substances pose the highest risks of these cross-resistances [7]. However, quaternary ammonium compounds, biguanides (i.e. surface active agents) and phenolics are considered as high-risk biocides concerning resistance problems [7]. For several substances (isothiazolones, anilides, diamidines, inorganic acids and their esters, alcohols), little information is available on resistance or tolerance [7]. Due to ‘the nature of their interaction with the bacterial cell and their antimicrobial efficacy’ [7], the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) considers them as medium-risk biocides. Several disinfectants have irritating or sensitising properties. A study showed that concentrations of the sensitising substances CMI/MI, glutardialdehyde, formaldehyde and chloroacetamide in disinfectants are in the same order of magnitude that leads to sensitising effects in laboratory tests [9]. Risks for the human health were especially high for spray applications or the use of concentrates for the cleaning of surfaces [9]. Some disinfectants or their metabolites can reach the environment. For example, the metabolite of triclosan, methyl-triclosan, was detected in surface waters [10] and biota [11]. Triclosan is also used in cosmetic products and in these cases does not fall under the BPR. Especially disinfection-by-products (DBP) which result from the reaction of <b>halogenated</b> oxidising <b>substances</b> with organic matter might pose risks that we are not aware of at the moment [12].|$|R
40|$|The 2006 WMO/UNEP Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion {{identified}} <b>halogenated</b> very short-lived <b>substances</b> (VSLS) as {{contributors to}} the atmospheric budget of halogens. As well, it raised a question regarding {{the extent of the}} contribution of halogenated VSLS to atmospheric Bry and Iy. Traditionally, scientists have been more concerned in determining the anthropogenic budget of halogenated compounds while nature is the major producer of such species. In order to have a complete atmospheric budget of halogenated VSLS, {{it is important to have}} a better understanding of what species are biogenically produced as well as their respective degradation pathways. Oceanic emissions of halocarbons may be a new link between climate change and the composition of the global atmosphere. The rates of halocarbon emissions are sensitive to sea-surface temperatures (SSTs), nutrient supply and upwelling; all of which are to be affected by climate change. Therefore, increases in SSTs will increase emission rates. On the one hand, seaweed has been identified as a major producer of biogenic polyhalogenated VSLS. Marine macroalgae (kelp) and phytoplankton emit halogen containing gases into the marine boundary layer, constituting 90 to 95 % of the total global flux of volatile halocarbons to the atmosphere. On the other hand, the possibility of industrial scale marine kelp farming as a means of carbon sequestration (i. e. marine analogy of the Kyoto Protocol forest) is being pondered by countries with long coastlines and little land suitable for forestation. Would a Kyoto Protocol forest analog be the right strategy for climate change mitigation?With the use of a portable Multi Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) spec- trometer, studies have been performed in the coast of New Zealand in order to determine the presence of BrO and IO during the spring and summer months of the Southern Hemisphere. MAX-DOAS uses scattered sunlight received from multiple viewing directions. The spatial distribution of various trace gases close to the instrument can be derived by combining several viewing geometries. Ground based MAX-DOAS is highly sensitive to absorbers in the lowest few kilometers of the atmosphere. The selected sites had high biomass concentration of marine algae that would be exposed by low tides and therefore, stressed in order to liberate the species of interest. In order to better understand the environmental factors that modulate the emissions of halogen oxides from the marine environment to the troposphere, results have been correlated to local macro algae type, ozone concentration, tidal height, incident sunlight, temperature and wind speed and direction...|$|R
40|$|<b>Halogenated</b> very {{short-lived}} <b>substances</b> (VSLSs) {{are naturally}} {{produced in the}} ocean and emitted to the atmosphere. When transported to the stratosphere, these compounds can have a significant influence on the ozone layer and climate. During a research cruise on RV Sonne in the subtropical and tropical west Indian Ocean in July and August 2014, we measured the VSLSs, methyl iodide (CH 3 I) {{and for the first}} time bromoform (CHBr 3) and dibromomethane (CH 2 Br 2), in surface seawater and the marine atmosphere to derive their emission strengths. Using the Lagrangian particle dispersion model FLEXPART with ERA-Interim meteorological fields, we calculated the direct contribution of observed VSLS emissions to the stratospheric halogen burden during the Asian summer monsoon. Furthermore, we compare the in situ calculations with the interannual variability of transport from a larger area of the west Indian Ocean surface to the stratosphere for July 2000 – 2015. We found that the west Indian Ocean is a strong source for CHBr 3 (910  pmol m− 2  h− 1), very strong source for CH 2 Br 2 (930  pmol m− 2  h− 1), and an average source for CH 3 I (460  pmol m− 2  h− 1). The atmospheric transport from the tropical west Indian Ocean surface to the stratosphere experiences two main pathways. On very short timescales, especially relevant for the shortest-lived compound CH 3 I (3. 5 days lifetime), convection above the Indian Ocean lifts oceanic air masses and VSLSs towards the tropopause. On a longer timescale, the Asian summer monsoon circulation transports oceanic VSLSs towards India and the Bay of Bengal, where they are lifted with the monsoon convection and reach stratospheric levels in the southeastern part of the Asian monsoon anticyclone. This transport pathway is more important for the longer-lived brominated compounds (17 and 150 days lifetime for CHBr 3 and CH 2 Br 2). The entrainment of CHBr 3 and CH 3 I from the west Indian Ocean to the stratosphere during the Asian summer monsoon is lower than from previous cruises in the tropical west Pacific Ocean during boreal autumn and early winter but higher than from the tropical Atlantic during boreal summer. In contrast, the projected CH 2 Br 2 entrainment was very high because of the high emissions during the west Indian Ocean cruise. The 16 -year July time series shows highest interannual variability for the shortest-lived CH 3 I and lowest for the longest-lived CH 2 Br 2. During this time period, a small increase in VSLS entrainment from the west Indian Ocean through the Asian monsoon to the stratosphere is found. Overall, this study confirms that the subtropical and tropical west Indian Ocean is an important source region of halogenated VSLSs, especially CH 2 Br 2, to the troposphere and stratosphere during the Asian summer monsoon...|$|R
40|$|Projections of {{stratospheric ozone}} from {{a suite of}} chemistry-climate models (CCMs) have been analyzed. In {{addition}} to a reference simulation where anthropogenic <b>halogenated</b> ozone depleting <b>substances</b> (ODSs) and greenhouse gases (GHGs) vary with time, sensitivity simulations with either ODS or GHG concentrations fixed at 1960 levels were performed to disaggregate the drivers of projected ozone changes. These simulations were also {{used to assess the}} two distinct milestones of ozone returning to historical values (ozone return dates) and ozone no longer being influenced by ODSs (full ozone recovery). The date of ozone returning to historical values does not indicate complete recovery from ODSs in most cases, because GHG-induced changes accelerate or decelerate ozone changes in many regions. In the upper stratosphere where CO 2 -induced stratospheric cooling increases ozone, full ozone recovery is projected to not likely have occurred by 2100 even though ozone returns to its 1980 or even 1960 levels well before (~ 2025 and 2040, respectively). In contrast, in the tropical lower stratosphere ozone decreases continuously from 1960 to 2100 due to projected increases in tropical upwelling, while by around 2040 it is already very likely that full recovery from the effects of ODSs has occurred, although ODS concentrations are still elevated by this date. In the midlatitude lower stratosphere the evolution differs from that in the tropics, and rather than a steady decrease in ozone, first a decrease in ozone is simulated from 1960 to 2000, which is then followed by a steady increase through the 21 st century. Ozone in the midlatitude lower stratosphere returns to 1980 levels by ~ 2045 in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and by ~ 2055 in the Southern Hemisphere (SH), and full ozone recovery is likely reached by 2100 in both hemispheres. Overall, in all regions except the tropical lower stratosphere, full ozone recovery from ODSs occurs significantly later than the return of total column ozone to its 1980 level. The latest return of total column ozone is projected to occur over Antarctica (~ 2045 – 2060) whereas it is not likely that full ozone recovery is reached {{by the end of the}} 21 st century in this region. Arctic total column ozone is projected to return to 1980 levels well before polar stratospheric halogen loading does so (~ 2025 – 2030 for total column ozone, cf. 2050 – 2070 for Cl y + 60 ×Br y) and it is likely that full recovery of total column ozone from the effects of ODSs has occurred by ~ 2035. In contrast to the Antarctic, by 2100 Arctic total column ozone is projected to be above 1960 levels, but not in the fixed GHG simulation, indicating that climate change plays a significant role...|$|R
40|$|As {{noted in}} the WMO/UNEP Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion: 2006, <b>halogenated</b> very {{short-lived}} <b>substances</b> (VSLS) contribute to the atmospheric budget of halogens and thereby lead to substantial decreases in ozone and increases in surface UV radiation in the tropics and mid-latitudes. Halogenated VSLS are primarily of natural origin; oceanic emissions constitute the largest source providing 90 - 95 % of the total global flux to the atmosphere. Macro algae in the ocean {{appear to be an}} important source of polyhalogenated VSLS. Oxidation of halogenated VSLS in the atmosphere (i. e. photolysis and reactions with OH) produces halogen oxide radicals (e. g. ClO, BrO, IO) which have been suggested as the main component of gas-phase halogens. Countries with long coastlines and little land suitable for forestation are investigating the possibility of industrial scale marine kelp farming as a means of carbon sequestration. This marine analogy of the Kyoto Protocol forest has been thought as a means to contribute to climate change mitigation. Knowledge of how natural emissions of VSLS will respond to both the drivers of climate change (e. g. changes in CO 2 and land use) and to the consequences of climate change (e. g. changes in sea surface temperature and wind stress) is very limited. As a result, it is imperative that observational studies are performed to quantify the contributions of these natural VSLS to halogen loading in the troposphere and, subsequently, in the stratosphere. For this, transport and degradation processes of the source gases and product gases need to be studied and quantified. A key question surfacing from the WMO Assessment is to what extent halogenated VSLS contribute to atmospheric Bry and Iy. During a field campaign conducted during the spring of 2009, measurements of BrO and IO were made along the coastline of the South Island of New Zealand using a portable Multi Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) spectrometer with the aim of determining coastal sites where high active halogen release could be observed. The selected sites had high biomass concentration of marine algae that would be exposed by low tides. Local macro algae type, tidal height, sunlight, temperature, and wind speed were recorded and correlated to the resulting data in order to better understand the environmental factors that modulate the emissions of halogen oxides from the marine environment to the troposphere. Results of this multi-disciplinary approach to studying brominated VSLS and their atmospheric implications are presented. As well, the chemical processes taking place and producing these halogen oxides are discussed in a thorough manner. This study contributes {{to a better understanding of}} the origin of bromine and iodine in the lowermost atmosphere (i. e. marine boundary layer). Particularly, the role that natural emissions of halogenated VSLS from the ocean may play in the halogen budget of the lower atmosphere is addressed by quantitatively understanding key links in this chain so that its potential future impacts on atmospheric chemistry, surface UV radiation, and the biosphere can be thoroughly assessed...|$|R
