50|$|Similar to the <b>hourglass</b> <b>dolphin,</b> Hector's {{dolphins}} use high-frequency echolocation clicks. However, the Hector's dolphin produces lower source-level clicks than hourglass dolphins due {{to their}} crowded environment. This means they can only spot prey at half the distance compared to an <b>hourglass</b> <b>dolphin.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>hourglass</b> <b>dolphin</b> (Lagenorhynchus cruciger) {{is a small}} dolphin in {{the family}} Delphinidae that inhabits Antarctic and subantarctic waters.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{there is}} {{evidence}} that the <b>Hourglass</b> <b>Dolphin</b> (Lagenorhynchus cruciger) should also be placed within the new genus, although the evidence for this species is less conclusive.|$|E
5000|$|They share feeding grounds {{with other}} {{cetaceans}} such as sei, pilot, bottlenose and minke whales and {{southern right whale}} dolphins. They are regularly seen with fin whales. Whalers who were hunting these much larger animals used <b>hourglass</b> <b>dolphins</b> as [...] "look-outs" [...] to aid them in their hunt. <b>Hourglass</b> <b>dolphins</b> are keen bow-wave riders.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hourglass</b> <b>dolphins</b> tend to move {{in groups}} of about 5 to 10. One International Whaling Commission study {{recorded}} a group of 60. Claimed groups of up to 100 have been found.|$|R
5000|$|... {{actually}} {{recovered the}} <b>hourglass</b> and Peale's <b>dolphins</b> as nested phylogenetically among the species of Cephalorhynchus, and they suggest these two species {{be transferred to}} that genus. Some acoustic and morphological data support for this arrangement. Both <b>hourglass</b> and Peale's <b>dolphins</b> share with the species of Cephalorhynchus a distinct type of echolocation signal known as a narrow-band, high-frequency signal. This signal is shared with porpoises (Phocoenidae) and pygmy sperm whales (Kogiidae), but is not found among other dolphin groups. According to , Peale's dolphin and the Cephalorhynchus species are the only dolphins that do not whistle. Presumably {{this is the case}} for <b>hourglass</b> <b>dolphins,</b> as well. Peale's dolphin also shares with several Cephalorhynchus species the possession of a distinct white [...] "armpit" [...] marking behind the pectoral fin.|$|R
50|$|Though it is {{traditionally}} {{placed in the}} genus Lagenorhynchus, recent molecular analyses indicate that the <b>hourglass</b> <b>dolphin</b> is actually {{more closely related to}} the dolphins of the genus Cephalorhynchus.|$|E
50|$|The <b>hourglass</b> <b>dolphin</b> {{is covered}} by the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MOU). Although {{they have not been}} studied {{extensively}} they are of least concern to conservationists.|$|E
5000|$|According to , Peale's dolphin and the Cephalorhynchus {{species are}} the only {{dolphins}} that do not whistle (no acoustic data are available for the <b>hourglass</b> <b>dolphin).</b> Peale's dolphin also shares with several Cephalorhynchus species the possession of a distinct white [...] "armpit" [...] marking behind the pectoral fin.|$|E
50|$|Southern {{right whale}} {{dolphins}} are very graceful and often move by leaping {{out of the}} water continuously. When they swim slowly, they expose only a small area of the head and back when they surface to breathe. Breaching, belly-flopping, side-slapping, and lob-tailing (slapping the flukes on the water surface) have been witnessed. They typically live in groups of two to 100. Some groups are more nervous than others, and swim away from boats, whereas others approach and possibly bow-ride. This tendency to bow-ride worked against them in the 19th century, as it allowed whalers to harpoon them from the bow and use them as food. Southern right whale dolphins are often seen in the company of <b>hourglass</b> <b>dolphins.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of whales and krill in two survey boxes north of South Georgia was examined by comparing sightings and underway acoustic data collected {{as part of}} a multi-disciplinary research cruise carried out during January/February 1998. A total of 222 cetaceans of 10 species was recorded with the southern right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) and humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) the two most frequent. The largest aggregation of cetaceans (21 southern right whales, 16 fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus), 4 sea whales (B. borealis), 1 humpback whale and 8 <b>hourglass</b> <b>dolphins</b> (Lagenorhynchus cruciger) occurred close to the largest single aggregation of krill. The level of association between baleen whales and krill was examined at a number of spatial scales. There was a positive relationship between whale abundance and mean krill density at the largest spatial scale examined (80 X 100 km). At progressively smaller scales the relationship was weakened, due mainly to the increased frequency of areas of high krill density where whales were not recorded. In particular, whales were absent from inshore areas (up to 300 m depth) that had higher mean krill densities compared with areas where whales were recorded. To thoroughly compare krill and whale distribution, particularly at smaller scales, will require information on krill swarm structure and density, as well as more information on the behaviour and feeding requirements of whales. Such information may also be crucial to understanding the role of scale-dependence in potential interspecies competition among krill-feeding marine predators...|$|R
5000|$|A phylogenetic {{analysis}} by [...] indicated {{the two species}} traditionally assigned to the genus Lagenorhynchus, the <b>hourglass</b> <b>dolphin</b> L. cruciger and Peale's dolphin L. australis are actually phylogenetically nested among the species of Cephalorhynchus, and they suggest these two species should {{be transferred to the}} genus Cephalorhynchus. Some acoustic and morphological data support this arrangement, at least with respect to Peale's dolphin.|$|E
50|$|Many species inhabit {{specific}} latitudes, {{often in}} tropical or subtropical waters, such as Bryde's whale or Risso's dolphin. Others are {{found only in}} a specific body of water. The {{southern right whale dolphin}} and the <b>hourglass</b> <b>dolphin</b> live only in the Southern Ocean. The narwhal and the beluga live only in the Arctic Ocean. Sowerby's beaked whale and the Clymene dolphin exist only in the Atlantic and the Pacific white-sided dolphin and the northern straight dolphin live only in the North Pacific.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>hourglass</b> <b>dolphin</b> is {{coloured}} {{black and}} white and sometimes variations of dark grey. For this reason, it was colloquially known by whalers as a [...] "sea cow" [...] (although it does not belong to the taxonomic order Sirenia.) Each flank has a white patch at the front, above the beak, eye and flipper, and a second patch at the rear. These two patches are connected by a thin white strip, creating, loosely speaking, an hourglass shape; hence the common name of the dolphin. The scientific name cruciger is Latin for [...] "cross-carrier". This refers to the area of black coloration, which, viewed from above, vaguely resembles a Maltese cross or cross pattée. There have been no verified sightings of calves and their coloration remains unknown.|$|E
5000|$|Recent {{analysis}} of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene indicates the genus Lagenorhynchus, as traditionally conceived, is not a natural (monophyletic) group. [...] found that the white-beaked and Atlantic white-sided dolphins were phylogenetically isolated within the Delphinidae, whereas the remaining four species {{were members of the}} Lissodelphinae, a predominantly Pacific clade of dolphins also including the right whale dolphins and the Cephalorhynchus dolphins. These findings are somewhat problematic taxonomically, since the white-beaked dolphin is the type species of the genus Lagenorhynchus; if the other species are not closely related to the white-beaked dolphin, then they must be removed from the genus. Accordingly, LeDuc et al. suggested that the Atlantic white-sided dolphin be placed within its own genus, Leucopleurus, and that the remaining species would need taxonomic revision, as well. Ledouc proposed Sagmatias as the new genus for the Pacific white-sided dolphin, Peale's dolphin, <b>hourglass</b> <b>dolphin</b> and dusky dolphin.|$|E
50|$|Almost {{no sexual}} {{dimorphism}} occurs in this species, although males have more curved dorsal fins with broader bases and greater surface areas. The {{back of the}} dolphin is dark grey or black, and the dorsal fin is distinctively two-toned; the leading edge matches the back in colour, but the trailing edge is a much lighter greyish white. The dusky dolphins has a long, light-grey patch on its fore side leading to a short, dark-grey beak. The throat and belly are white, and the beak and lower jaw are dark grey. Two blazes of white colour run back on the body from the dorsal fin to the tail. Right between the white areas remains a characteristic thorn-shaped patch of dark colour, by which the species can easily be recognised. Aside from that, dusky dolphins may be confused {{with other members of}} their genus when observed at sea.It can be distinguished from the common dolphin, which has a more prominent and longer beak and yellow flank markings. The skull of a dusky dolphin has a longer and narrower rostrum than that of an <b>hourglass</b> <b>dolphin</b> or Peale's dolphin of similar age and size.|$|E
40|$|Since 1993, fishery {{observers}} {{from the}} Instituto Español de Oceanografía (lEO) have recorded incidental sightings and by-catches of marine mammals and seabirds from Spanish fishing boats in intemational {{waters of the}} southwest Atlantic. The lEO recently implemented an observer pragramme on-board research vessels in the area, recording data on marine mammal and seabird sightings. The objectives of this programme inc 1 ude (a) determining the distribution of marine marnmals and seabirds, (b) modelling habitat use, and (e) monitoring interactions with fishing operations. Data are collected on species present, numbers, behaviour, enviranmental conditions and interactions with fishing activities. Here we present a summary of results fram the fishery observers and a preliminary report on the results from surveys inc 1 uding distribution maps. The cetacean species most frequently sighted fram commercial vessels were Peale's dolphin (Lagenorhynchus australis) and <b>hourglass</b> <b>dolphin</b> (Lagenorhynchus cruciger). Other species of cetaceans observed inc 1 uded common dolphin (Delphinus sp.), pilot whale (Globicephala sp.), sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) and southem right whale (Eubalaena australis), minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), killer whales (Orcinus orca) and southem right whale dolphin (Lissodelphis peronii),. Recent observations fram a longliner inc 1 ude spenn whales following the boat for several days, suggesting that they were feeding {{in association with the}} boat, e. g. on fish hooked on the lines.

40|$|Study Project 99 / 016 “Data {{collection}} for stock assessment of two hakes (Merluccius hubbsi and M. australis) in international and Falkland {{waters of the}} SW Atlantic” ran from January 2000 to December 2001. The main objective {{of the project was}} the collection and collation of already existing and newly acquired fishery and biological data needed for preliminary assessment of two hake species occurring in the study area. In addition to this basic remit, additional objectives included the creation of a common database, study of spawning seasons and areas, discard pattern and length-frequency composition of target and non-target species, estimation of annual by-catch rates, analysis of trophic relationships, marine mammals by-catch and sightings, morphometric analysis for stock differentiation, and developing GIS applications for analysis of the data collected. Historical fishery and biological data series available from IEO and FIGFD (since 1988 and 1987 respectively) were provided to the project. New fishery and biological data were collected by scientific observers provided by IEO, ANAMER and FIGFD, and placed on board Spanish fishing vessels operating in the study area during the project period. Data on fishing activity included effort, catches and discards of target and non-target species on a haul-by-haul basis. Biological information (size, sex, maturity stage, etc) of target and non-target species was recorded on a daily basis. Data on landings and effort were provided by ANAMER to its subcontractor (MG OTERO) for processing and estimation of total catch and effort of the whole Spanish fishing fleet in the area; MG OTERO was also responsible for organisation of observers in collaboration with ANAMER staff in Vigo and Port Stanley. Ancillary data on location, time of fishing, depth, SST, SBT, sea roughness, wind, etc, was recorded on a haul-by-haul basis. This type of information was essential for development of GIS at AU to relate the species distribution to physical and environmental factors. Other information collected was about by-catches and sightings of small cetaceans and seabirds, and biological samples such as otoliths, stomachs and whole specimens of hakes for subsequent studies on growth (IEO, FIGFD), diet and morphometrics (AU). All the historical and new data collected during the project were collated and integrated into a common database designed by all participants and built at IEO. The information was used for preliminary assessment of two hake populations co-ordinated by RRAG during a workshop held in London in July 2001. All these data will be analysed and written up for future publications. Discard rates of target species were generally low in all areas and seasons with the highest discard rate for Notothen sp. (around 100 % of the catch). Illex squid was found to be the major by-catch for hake fishery in the 46 S area. IEO observers reported data on incidental catches of marine mammals and sea birds since 1993 and the analysis of this information was made by AU. The observed mortality in the fishing gears comprised small numbers of black-browed albatross, gentoo penguin and the <b>hourglass</b> <b>dolphin.</b> The species most frequently sighted was the Peale’s dolphin, although this species did not appear in by-catches, followed by the <b>hourglass</b> <b>dolphin.</b> The project provided an opportunity to collect and integrate {{for the first time at}} European level the necessary fishery and biological data for the development of partial stock assessment for the future rational management of the fisheries in the area. Such management is needed for the sustainability of the commercial fisheries, the conservation of the onshore and offshore jobs and the supply of fish to the most important markets worldwide.
