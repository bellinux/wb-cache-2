25|$|Truncation {{errors are}} {{committed}} when an iterative method is terminated or a mathematical procedure is approximated, and the approximate solution {{differs from the}} exact solution. Similarly, <b>discretization</b> induces a <b>discretization</b> error because {{the solution of the}} discrete problem does not coincide with the solution of the continuous problem. For instance, in the iteration in the sidebar to compute the solution of , after 10 or so iterations, we conclude that the root is roughly 1.99 (for example). We therefore have a truncation error of 0.01.|$|E

25|$|The {{result of}} {{rounding}} {{differs from the}} true value by about 0.03 parts per million, and matches the decimal representation of π in the first 7 digits. The difference is the <b>discretization</b> error and {{is limited by the}} machine epsilon.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We propose {{integrable}} <b>discretizations</b> of derivative nonlinear Schrödinger (DNLS) equations {{such as the}} Kaup–Newell equation, the Chen–Lee–Liu equation and the Gerdjikov–Ivanov equation by constructing Lax pairs. The discrete DNLS systems {{admit the}} reduction of complex conjugation between two dependent variables and possess bi-Hamiltonian structure. Through transformations of variables and reductions, we obtain novel integrable <b>discretizations</b> of the nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS), modified KdV (mKdV), mixed NLS, matrix NLS, matrix KdV, matrix mKdV, coupled NLS, coupled Hirota, coupled Sasa–Satsuma and Burgers equations. We also discuss integrable <b>discretizations</b> of the sine-Gordon equation, the massive Thirring model and their generalizations.

40|$|Dedicated to Víctor Pereyra on the {{occasion}} of his 70 th birthday Abstract. This paper is a numerical study of different <b>discretizations</b> for a mixed formulation of the Darcy-Forchheimer equation. Different finite elements are used: constant functions, conformal linear functions and Crouzeix-Raviart non-conformal finite elements. The behavior of the <b>discretizations</b> is analyzed through a comparative study of some test problems. The numerical results suggest that one of the proposed <b>discretizations</b> has better convergence properties for the velocity. Key words.

40|$|We {{find time}} <b>discretizations</b> {{for the two}} ''second flows'' of the Ablowitz-Ladik hierachy. These <b>discretizations</b> are {{described}} by local equations of motion, {{as opposed to the}} previously known ones, due to Taha and Ablowitz. Certain superpositions of our maps allow a one-field reduction and serve therefore as valid space-time <b>discretizations</b> of the modified Korteweg-de Vries equation. We expect the performance of these <b>discretizations</b> to be much better then that of the Taha-Ablowitz scheme. The way of finding interpolating Hamiltonians for our maps is also indicated, as well as the solution of an initial value problem in terms of matrix factorizations. Comment: 23 pages, LaTe...|$|R
25|$|Another {{difficulty}} {{here is that}} spin foams {{are defined}} on a <b>discretization</b> of spacetime. While this presents no problems for a topological field theory as it has no local degrees of freedom, it presents problems for GR. This {{is known as the}} problem triangularization dependence.|$|E
25|$|According to this, {{the length}} of the {{hypotenuse}} of a right angled triangle in discretized space is always equal to {{the length of}} one of the two sides, in contradiction to geometry. Jean Paul Van Bendegem has argued that the Tile Argument can be resolved, and that <b>discretization</b> can therefore remove the paradox.|$|E
25|$|The ion {{and partial}} charges on protein {{residues}} {{are assigned to}} a finite rectangular grid using the cloud-in-cell (CIC) scheme. Solving the Poisson equation on the grid counts for the particlemesh component of the P3M scheme.

40|$|The {{theory of}} {{polyhedral}} surfaces [...] . In this paper, we investigate conformal <b>discretizations</b> of surfaces, i. e. <b>discretizations</b> {{in terms of}} circles and spheres, and introduce a new discrete model for minimal surfaces.

In comparison with direct methods (see, in particular, [17]), leading usually to triangle meshes, the less intuitive <b>discretizations</b> of the present paper have essential advantages: they respect conformal properties of surfaces, possess a maximum principle, etc [...] ...|$|R
30|$|In this section, the {{thermodynamic}} compatibility of 2 D FE spatial <b>discretizations</b> {{based on}} linear triangular elements is investigated.

25|$|<b>Discretization</b> is {{typically}} achieved by sampling the Gaussian filter kernel at discrete points, normally at positions {{corresponding to the}} midpoints of each pixel. This reduces the computational cost but, for very small filter kernels, point sampling the Gaussian function with very few samples leads to a large error. In these cases, accuracy is maintained (at a slight computational cost) by integration of the Gaussian function over each pixel's area.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{continuous}} problems must {{sometimes be}} replaced by a discrete problem whose solution is known to approximate that of the continuous problem; this process is called <b>discretization.</b> For example, the solution of a differential equation is a function. This function must be represented by a finite amount of data, for instance by its value at a finite number of points at its domain, even though this domain is a continuum.|$|E
25|$|ANNs are {{frequently}} used in reinforcement learning {{as part of}} the overall algorithm. Dynamic programming was coupled with ANNs (giving neurodynamic programming) by Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis and applied to multi-dimensional nonlinear problems such as those involved in vehicle routing, natural resources management or medicine, because of the ability of ANNs to mitigate losses of accuracy even when reducing the <b>discretization</b> grid density for numerically approximating the solution of the original control problems.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Certain {{classes of}} nodal methods and mixed-hybrid nite element methods lead to equivalent, robust, and {{accurate}} <b>discretizations</b> of second-order elliptic PDEs.

By eliminating dierent subsets of unknowns, two Schur complements are obtained with known structure. Replacing key matrices in this structure by lumped approximations, we dene three optimal preconditioners. Central to the optimal performance of these preconditioners is their sparsity structure which is compatible with standard nite dierence <b>discretizations</b> and hence treated adequately with only a single multigrid cycle. In this paper we restrict the discussion to the two-dimensional case; these techniques are readily extended to three dimensions...|$|R

25|$|Gaussian {{smoothing}} {{is commonly}} used with edge detection. Most edge-detection algorithms are sensitive to noise; the 2-D Laplacian filter, built from a <b>discretization</b> of the Laplace operator, is highly sensitive to noisy environments. Using a Gaussian Blur filter before edge detection aims to reduce the level of noise in the image, which improves {{the result of the}} following edge-detection algorithm. This approach is commonly referred to as Laplacian of Gaussian, or LoG filtering.|$|E
25|$|Computational {{mathematics}} proposes {{and studies}} methods for solving mathematical {{problems that are}} typically too large for human numerical capacity. Numerical analysis studies methods for problems in analysis using functional analysis and approximation theory; numerical analysis includes the study of approximation and <b>discretization</b> broadly with special concern for rounding errors. Numerical analysis and, more broadly, scientific computing also study non-analytic topics of mathematical science, especially algorithmic matrix and graph theory. Other areas of computational mathematics include computer algebra and symbolic computation.|$|E
25|$|Another {{factor that}} impacts total CPU time needed by a {{simulation}} {{is the size}} of the integration timestep. This is the time length between evaluations of the potential. The timestep must be chosen small enough to avoid <b>discretization</b> errors (i.e., smaller than the fastest vibrational frequency in the system). Typical timesteps for classical MD are in the order of 1femtosecond (10−15 s). This value may be extended by using algorithms such as the SHAKE constraint algorithm, which fix the vibrations of the fastest atoms (e.g., hydrogens) into place. Multiple time scale methods have also been developed, which allow extended times between updates of slower long-range forces.|$|E

A Fourier based analysis shows that the four discrete operators converge to the continuous ones in appropriate Sobolev norms. This proves that Nyström <b>discretizations</b> of many popular integral equation formulations for Helmholtz equations are stable and convergent.

However, the atomic electron and proton are held together by electromagnetic force, while planets and celestial objects are held by gravity. Because of the <b>discretization</b> of angular momentum postulated in early quantum mechanics by Bohr, the electron in the Bohr model can only occupy certain allowed distances from the proton, and therefore only certain allowed energies.|$|E

40|$|Summary. Mortar <b>discretizations</b> {{have been}} {{developed}} for coupling different ap-proximations in different subdomains, that can arise from engineering applications in complicated structures with highly non-uniform materials. The complexity of the mortar <b>discretizations</b> requires fast algorithms for solving the resulting linear sys-tems. Several domain decomposition algorithms, that have been successfully applied to conforming finite element <b>discretizations,</b> have been extended to the linear systems of mortar <b>discretizations.</b> They are overlapping Schwarz methods, FETI-DP (Dual-Primal Finite Element Tearing and Interconnecting) methods, and BDDC (Balanc-ing Domain Decomposition by Constraints) methods. The new result is that com-plete analysis, providing the optimal condition number estimate, has been done for geometrically non-conforming subdomain partitions and for problems with discon-tinuous coefficients. These algorithms were further applied to the two-dimensional Stokes and three-dimensional elasticity. In addition, a BDDC algorithm with an inexact coarse problem was developed. ...|$|R
