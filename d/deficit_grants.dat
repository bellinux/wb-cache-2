In the public finances, {{the current account}} of the nonfinancial public sector (before grants) shifted from balance in 1991 to a deficit of 3. 8 percent of GDP in 1994. With the lack of foreign financing, capital investment fell to low levels over the period, and the overall <b>deficit</b> (before <b>grants)</b> declined from 4. 5 percent of GDP to 4. 2 percent of GDP; the deficit was financed mainly by recourse to central bank credit and the accumulation of arrears. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{a recent}} {{compilation}} of lessons learned about decentralization, Roy Bahl (1999) highlighted three channels through which central interventions often undermine {{the discipline of}} a hard budget constraint for local governments. These are “deficit grants ” to cover year-end deficits on local government budgets, direct central government coverage of shortfalls on specific items of expenditure, and bailouts on delinquent debt. All three channels involve direct or indirect fiscal assistance {{at the end of}} the year from central authorities. Repeated over time, such assistance can potentially create a regime of soft budgets, effectively undermining the fiscal resolve of sub-national governments and the efficiency gains expected from moving government closer to communities. In the case of South Africa, all three of the channels [...] <b>deficit</b> <b>grants,</b> coverage of specific expenditure shortfalls, and bailouts [...] have been utilized by the central government to provide assistance to sub-national governments in both the apartheid and the present democratic eras. That South Africa, at first glance, conforms to the international experience of how hard-budget constraint for sub-national governments have been violated adds little new information to the vast policy literature on decentralizatio...|$|E

40|$|Executive Summary. The {{euro area}} is still {{suffering}} from low growth and high unemployment. For the recovery {{to become a}} reality, {{there needs to be}} a balance between fiscal discipline, supply side improvements and actions aimed at stimulating demand and growth. Increasing investment, both private and public, are important components in overcoming the recession. This becomes especially clear when comparing investment dynamics during the crisis with pre-crisis levels. Total investment is still much lower than before the crisis and public investment is well below its pre-crisis peak as well. In late November 2014, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker submitted a long-awaited proposal for a European Investment Plan that aims to stimulate private investment. Apart from the creation of the new European Fund for Strategic Investment (EFSI), through which private investors will receive public guarantees, the investment plan also aims to provide project assistance and improve the Single Market by removing sector-specific or other financial barriers to investment. While generally perceived as a first positive step towards increasing private investment, some commentators have expressed reservations about the plan. These include, among others, the lack of fresh money for the initial contributions to EFSI. Since a substantial amount of these contributions is reshuffled from other places in the European budget, the question was raised whether EFSI can fund additional projects or just replicates investment projects that would have happened without the plan. Other criticism relates to the high estimate of the expected leverage ratio of 1 : 15, and to the risk that the plan will only have a limited impact on stressed economies. The Juncker Plan addresses private investment, but so far there really is no clear strategy to stimulate productive public investment on the European and national level. Countries with fiscal space are reluctant to engage in higher spending, while those willing and in need of it the most are restricted by the rules. Member States and the Commission should therefore discuss options for further improving the euro area's economic governance. In addition to urging countries with fiscal space to increase investing in national public goods, investment could be treated with budget flexibility. One could, for instance, upgrade the importance of public investment in the European Semester. Additional <b>deficit</b> <b>granted</b> for public investment purposes could be attached to certain Country-Specific Recommendations. Another solution would be to allow some form of budget flexibility, such as the formulation of a new Golden Rule for productive public investment becoming part of the Stability and Growth Pact's application. Besides relying on a larger amount of flexibility in the rules, the Financial Transaction Tax (FTT) could be another solution to fund investment in European public goods. It will also be necessary to overcome the mistrust among Member States that is preventing further action. The political bargain of stronger conditionality, such as through contractual arrangements, could improve the situation. Increased trust will also be an important condition for tackling long-reaching economic governance reforms such as the creation of a Fiscal Capacity, which could take the form of a macroeconomic shock insurance. Such a Fiscal Capacity could make a real difference in providing the necessary funding to maintain productive public investment, even in times of deep recessions. The proposals presented do not attempt to be conclusive, but shall rather be an input for a wider debate on how to increase growth and employment in Europe. The paper draws heavily on the discussion of a Workshop on Growth and Investment, which the European Policy Centre (EPC) hosted on 10 December 2014 under Chatham-House Rule, with a group of economists and representatives from the European institutions...|$|R
40|$|There is {{considerable}} {{interest in the}} early detection of neuromotor deficits, including disorders {{that may be the}} result of toxin exposure during early development. Until recently, quantifiable methods for determining the immediate developmental effects of prenatal toxin exposure have been unavailable. However, several behavioral measures employed in this lab have shown clear prenatal patterns of development, suggesting their possible utility in detecting early assaults to the CNS. To test this hypothesis, pregnant rats were injected with the neurotoxin methyazoxymethanol (MAM, Midwest Research Inst.) on E 17 of gestation. Fetuses then were prepared for in vivo behavioral observation 72 hours later, on E 20, to measure: (a) interlimb movement synchrony between different pairwise limb combinations during spontaneous movement, (b) facial wiping response to intraoral lemon infusion, which requires coordination between forepaws and face, and (c) presentation of an artificial nipple, which evokes oral grasping responses in fetal rats. Although MAM-treated subjects did not differ from saline controls in overall appearance and weight, clear disruptions of movement coordination were seen in all three behavioral measures. These results suggest that these quantifiable behavioral measures may be useful in the prenatal assessment of CNS <b>deficits.</b> Supported by <b>grant</b> HD 33862 to SRR...|$|R

The annual Infant mortality rate and child mortality rates ranges between 52 to 84 and 74 to 137 respectively in 2008 while literacy rate of the region is estimated between 47 and 78 percent in 2008. Overall, the EAC recorded an average per capita of US$ 502 with Kenya US$ 794, Uganda US$ 556, Tanzania US$ 525, Rwanda US$ 494 and Burundi US$ 164. In aggregate, total GDP for the region amounted to US$ 73, 338 million in 2008, compared to US$ 60, 258 in 2007. The average annual underlying inflation rate increased to 13. 3 percent in 2008 from 7. 6 percent in 2007.
