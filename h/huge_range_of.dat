5|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the view that}} science rests on foundational assumptions, coherentism asserts that statements are justified by being a part of a coherent system. Or, rather, individual statements cannot be validated on their own: only coherent systems can be justified. A prediction of a transit of Venus is justified by its being coherent with broader beliefs about celestial mechanics and earlier observations. As explained above, observation is a cognitive act. That is, it relies on a pre-existing understanding, a systematic set of beliefs. An observation of a transit of Venus requires a <b>huge</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> auxiliary beliefs, such as those that describe the optics of telescopes, the mechanics of the telescope mount, and an understanding of celestial mechanics. If the prediction fails and a transit is not observed, that is likely to occasion an adjustment in the system, a change in some auxiliary assumption, rather than a rejection of the theoretical system.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Geophysical {{processes}} are typically variable over <b>huge</b> <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> space-time scales. This has {{lead to the}} de-velopment of many techniques for decomposing series and fields into fluctuations 1 v at well-defined scales. Clas-sically, one defines fluctuations as differences: (1 v) diff = v(x+ 1 x) −v(x) and this is adequate for many applications (1 x is the “lag”). However, if over a range one has scal-ing 1 v ∝ 1 xH, these difference fluctuations are only ade-quate when 0 <H < 1. Hence, there {{is the need for}} other types of fluctuations. In particular, atmospheric processes in the “macroweather ” range ≈ 10 days to 10 – 30 yr generally have − 1 <H < 0, so that a definition valid over the range − 1 <H < 1 would be very useful for atmospheric applica-tions. A general framework for defining fluctuations is wavelets...|$|R

40|$|After the {{historical}} detection of a neutrino burst {{coming from the}} supernova 1987 A, the interest for supernova neutrinos continuously grew up. Such interest has been further strengthened by the recent enormous progresses {{in the understanding of}} neutrino mixing and oscillations. Since neutrinos are very elusive particles, they can preserve a lot of information about their production site even if they traverse huge distances (tens of Kpc or more) before being detected. On the other hand, supernovae are very peculiar physical systems, with unique conditions of density and temperature; then, the interior of a collapsed star is the ideal environment where the neutrino flavour conversion mediated by matter effects can be realized. Moreover, since the neutrino detectors are sensitive to stellar gravitational collapses everywhere in the galaxy, a type II supernova (from now on: SN) explosion offers an extraordinary possibility for studying neutrino properties beyond the Standard Model (mass, electric charge, magnetic moment, mixing [...] .) in <b>huge</b> <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> distances and densities. FInally, supernovae emit neutrinos, photons and probably gravitational waves; then, a combined observation of all forms of radiation released during a stellar collapse would provide not only an unprecedented amount of information about the collapse mechanism, but also great opportunities for testing various aspects of Special and General Relativity theories. In this paper I review the present and planned supernova neutrino detectors, their experimental techniques and the expected neutrino signal and discuss the implications for the supernova and neutrino physics of a high statistics neutrino burst detection...|$|R
