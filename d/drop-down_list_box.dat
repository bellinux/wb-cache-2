5000|$|A {{combo box}} is a {{commonly}} used {{graphical user interface}} widget (or control). Traditionally, it {{is a combination of}} a <b>drop-down</b> <b>list</b> or <b>list</b> <b>box</b> and a single-line editable textbox, allowing the user to either type a value directly or select a value from the list. The term [...] "combo box" [...] is sometimes used to mean [...] "drop-down list". In both Java and [...]NET, [...] "combo box" [...] is not a synonym for [...] "drop-down list".

40|$|Enterprise {{resource}} {{planning systems}} and computerised maintenance management systems {{are commonly used}} by organisations for handling of maintenance work orders through a graphical user interface. A work order consists {{of a number of}} data fields, such as <b>drop-down</b> <b>lists,</b> <b>list</b> <b>boxes,</b> check boxes and text entry fields. In contrast to the other data fields, the operator has the freedom to type in any text in the text entry fields, to complement and make the work order description complete. Accordingly, the text entry fields of work orders can contain any words, in any number, as necessary. Data quality is crucial in statistical analysis of work orders data, and therefore manual analysis of work orders’ text entry fields is often necessary before any decision making. However, this may be a very tedious and resource consuming process. In this article, we apply computerised analysis of text entry fields of work orders data, to study if it can bring further value in the assessment of technical assets’ performance.

5000|$|Dropdown menu: In {{computing}} with graphical user interfaces, a dropdown menu or {{drop-down menu}} or <b>drop-down</b> <b>list</b> is a user interface control GUI element ("widget" [...] or [...] "control"), {{similar to a}} <b>list</b> <b>box,</b> which allows the user to choose one value from a list.|$|R
50|$|A cycle button's {{advantage}} over radio buttons or a <b>list</b> <b>box</b> {{is that it}} takes less screen space; its {{advantage over}} a <b>drop-down</b> <b>list</b> is that a single mouse click is enough to switch between the two options. However, a disadvantage is that, if the button has many options, a lot of clicks are needed to switch to the desired one. This is why some GUI environments {{have the ability to}} display the same element as a cycle button or a <b>drop-down</b> <b>list,</b> depending on the number of options.|$|R
50|$|A <b>{{drop-down}}</b> <b>list</b> (abbreviated drop-down; {{also known}} as a drop-down menu. drop menu, pull-down list, picklist) is a graphical control element, similar to a <b>list</b> <b>box,</b> that allows the user to choose one value from a <b>list.</b> When a <b>drop-down</b> <b>list</b> is inactive, it displays a single value. When activated, it displays (drops down) a list of values, from which the user may select one. When the user selects a new value, the control reverts to its inactive state, displaying the selected value. It is often used in the design of graphical user interfaces, including web design.|$|R

5000|$|... 2000-2004: ActionScript [...] "1.0" [...] With {{the release}} of Flash 5 in September 2000, the [...] "actions" [...] from Flash 4 were {{enhanced}} once more and named [...] "ActionScript" [...] for the first time. This was {{the first version of}} ActionScript with influences from JavaScript and the ECMA-262 (Third Edition) standard, supporting the said standard's object model and many of its core data types. Local variables may be declared with the var statement, and user-defined functions with parameter passing and return values can also be created. Notably, ActionScript could now also be typed with a text editor rather than being assembled by choosing actions from <b>drop-down</b> <b>lists</b> and dialog <b>box</b> controls. With the next release of its authoring tool, Flash MX, and its corresponding player, Flash Player 6, the language remained essentially unchanged; there were only minor changes, such as the addition of the switch statement and the [...] "strict equality" [...] (===) operator, which brought it closer to being ECMA-262-compliant. Two important features of ActionScript that distinguish it from later versions are its loose type system and its reliance on prototype-based inheritance. Loose typing refers to the ability of a variable to hold any type of data. This allows for rapid script development and is particularly well-suited for small-scale scripting projects. Prototype-based inheritance is the ActionScript 1.0 mechanism for code reuse and object-oriented programming. Instead of a class keyword that defines common characteristics of a class, ActionScript 1.0 uses a special object that serves as a [...] "prototype" [...] for a class of objects. All common characteristics of a class are defined in the class's prototype object and every instance of that class contains a link to that prototype object.|$|R

40|$|Information in the IDIS 4. 0  Drug Database Pharmacists are {{sometimes}} {{called upon to}} compound a drug product for a patient. The key to finding information related to extemporaneous preparation of drug products in the IDIS 4. 0 Drug Database is Descriptor PREPARATION 35. “Extemporaneous Compounding ” and “Extemporaneous Preparation ” are cross-referenced to descriptor PREPARATION 35. The IDIS 4. 0 definition for descriptor 35 is “Preparation of a drug immediately prior to administration to the patient, (e. g., pH adjustment, dilution, extemporaneous techniques, directions for in vivo or in vitro labeling of radiopharmaceuticals”). Combining a drug or drug names with descriptor PREPARATION 35 and an administration descriptor (e. g. ADMIN RECTAL 101 or TOPICAL 65) is a good search strategy for finding articles related to compounding and preparing drug products for a specific unique route of administration. Search Question 1 : Is there a formulation for preparing sumatriptan suppositories? Search Strategy: Begin typing sumatriptan in the Drug Field and select “SUMATRIPTAN 28081292 ” from the <b>drop-down</b> <b>list</b> that appears. Likewise, in the Descriptor Field select “PREPARATION 35 ” from the <b>drop-down</b> <b>list.</b> Suppository or Rectal suppository is cross-referenced to ADM RECTAL 101 {{as can be seen}} from the <b>drop-down</b> <b>list.</b> About the Author...|$|R
