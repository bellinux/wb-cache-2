5|$|One Arsenal supporter, Paul Dineen {{was stabbed}} {{in the back with}} a knife, during the riots in a pub, near the City Hall Square. The {{incident}} caused Arsenal to offer their fans full compensation, if {{they did not want to}} travel and attend the match. Another three members of the public, identified as one Englishman, Turk and Dutchman were also wounded by <b>knifing</b> when the event was still under its way. Sixty people, all presumed to have been involved, were detained by Danish law enforcement, while another 19 suffered injuries as a result of the violence.|$|E
5|$|After <b>knifing</b> {{another man}} during a fight, {{in an attack}} he claimed was {{triggered}} by the abuse he had suffered since the trial, Smith was sentenced {{to three years in}} prison in 1969. That same year his children were taken into the care of the local authority. His wife Maureen moved from Underwood Court to a single-bedroom property, and found work in a department store. Subjected to whispering campaigns and petitions to remove her from the estate where she lived, she received no support from her family—her mother had supported Myra during the trial. On his release from prison, David Smith moved in with the girl who became his second wife and won custody of his three sons. Maureen managed to repair the relationship with her mother, and moved into a council property in Gorton. She divorced Smith in 1973, and married a lorry driver, Bill Scott, with whom she had a daughter.|$|E

25|$|The {{action in}} this year's Tour Championships {{began with the}} Red Group with Wimbledon {{champion}} Petra Kvitová and 2008 finalist Vera Zvonareva. Having lost to Zvonareva in straight sets {{just a few weeks}} ago in Tokyo, Kvitová had her work cut out for her, but this time it was different - Kvitová hadn't lost an indoor match all year and her huge serve, powerful groundstrokes and strong net play were working like a charm as she raced out to a 6–2, 4–1 lead. Things got tougher as the unforced errors began to creep into Kvitová's game, and Zvonareva closed the gap to 4–all in the second set; but the No.3-seeded Kvitová broke again for 5–4 and served it out, getting two errors in a row from the No.6-seeded Zvonareva to get to match point then <b>knifing</b> a forehand volley. The series between the two is now knotted at 3–3. Kvitová ended with an even differential, 24 winners to 24 errors; she won 17 of 23 net points (including match point). Zvonareva was −9 (eight winners, 17 errors).|$|E
25|$|If the Brothers {{received}} a refusal or negative response from {{an owner of}} a business they wished to takeover, the Brothers or their associates would ensure nightly visits to the business where they would threaten patrons and staff and continue the hostility and if worse came to worse threaten the owners life. There were many cases of the attacks on business owners, {{one of them was}} Louis Fornier, owner of Jean Lou Cabaret, who refused the transaction with the Brothers and later was murdered on June 20, 1971. Another case similar to this, but ending on a better note, was that of Laurier Gatien the man who owned the Tavern Montreal at the time who had to endure multiple attempts on his life including shootings, <b>knifing,</b> and attacks with billiard cues and balls. Gatien could not deal with the pressure and later had to sell the tavern in October 1973. One of the Brother, Claude Dubois, had decided to expand the protection taxes even further by including pimps, prostitutes and strippers by requiring them to buy a work permit if they wished to work the streets or work in the club within the Dubois territory.|$|E

50|$|Very sharp <b>knives</b> sharpen {{at about}} 10 dps (degrees per side) (which {{implies that the}} <b>knife's</b> edge has an {{included}} angle of 20-degrees). Generally speaking, razors, paring <b>knives,</b> and fillet <b>knives</b> should be the sharpest <b>knives</b> at an angle of 12° - 18°. Most kitchen <b>knives,</b> like utility/slicing <b>knives,</b> chef’s <b>knives,</b> boning <b>knives,</b> carving <b>knives,</b> should be sharpened to 15° - 25°. The exceptions are Japanese style <b>knives</b> that are usually sharpened to 14° - 16° depending on the <b>knife</b> maker. Japanese style <b>knives</b> utilize a much harder steel, {{and are therefore more}} brittle than their Western style counterparts. This means care should be taken when handling these <b>knives</b> as they are susceptible to chipping and breaking. The sporting <b>knife</b> category, including pocket <b>knives,</b> survival <b>knives,</b> and hunting <b>knives,</b> sees more intense action and should be sharpened to the 25° - 30° angle range. The less sharp angle means there is more metal there to cut, thus providing more durability out in the field. For an extremely durable edge, a machete, chisel, drawknife or ax should be sharpened down to 30° - 40° providing even more ruggedness and longer lasting sharpness.|$|R
2500|$|Powell now {{drew out}} his knife and burst through Seward's bedroom door. Inside were Seward's Army nurse, Sergeant George F. Robinson, and Fanny Seward. Powell slashed Robinson on the forearm, and the soldier fell. Powell punched Fanny in the face, and leapt onto the bed. He savagely began <b>knifing</b> Seward {{in the head}} and throat. Seward, however, was wearing a metal and canvas splint on his jaw, which {{deflected}} most of Powell's blows. However, Powell managed to cut through Seward's right cheek and along his right throat, causing a large amount of blood flow. Believing Seward to be dead, Powell hesitated. Just then, Seward's other son, Augustus, burst into the room. Powell stabbed him several times. [...] Augustus dragged Powell onto the floor.

2500|$|On 23 June 1944, Koenig {{began to}} operate, giving orders {{to all the}} SOE and OSS agents via the Special Forces Headquarters. By this time, the maquis had formed {{assassination}} squads to kill collaborators and on 28 June 1944, a group of maquisards disguised as miliciens were able to enter the apartment of the radio newscaster Philippe Henriot who was serving as Minister of Information and Propaganda in the Vichy government and shot him {{down in front of}} his wife. Darnard had the Milice go on a rampage after Henriot's assassination, massacring résistants in Toulouse, Clermont-Ferrand, Grenoble, Lyon and other places with for example, seven résistants being publicity shot by the Milice in the town square of Mâcon. [...] All over France, the Germans lashed out against the Resistance in an orgy of killings, of which the massacre at Oradour-sur-Glane is merely the most infamous. Speaking of an atrocity committed outside of Nice in July 1944, one man testified at Nurnberg: [...] "Having been attacked [...] [...] [...] by several groups of Maquis in the region, by way of reprisals, a Mongolian detachment, still under the SS, went to a farm where two French members of the Resistance had been hidden. Being unable to take them prisoner, these soldiers then took the proprietors of that farm (the husband and wife), and after subjecting them to numerous atrocities (<b>knifing,</b> rape, et cetera) they shot them down with submachine guns. Then they took the son of these victims who was only three years of age, and, after having frightfully tortured him, they crucified him on the gate of the farmhouse". The reference to the [...] "Mongolians" [...] were to Asians serving in the Red Army who been captured by the Wehrmacht and joined either the German Army's Ostlegionen or the SS; the French called all these men [...] "Mongols" [...] regardless if they were Mongols or not. The Milice was especially hated by the Resistance and captured miliciens could expect little mercy. One maquisard fighting in the Haute-Savoie wrote in his diary about the fate of a milicien taken prisoner in July 1944: [...] "Aged twenty-nine, married three months ago. Made to saw wood in the hot sun wearing a pullover and jacket. Made to drink warm salted water. Ears cut off. Covered with blows from fists and bayonets. Stoned. Made to dig his gave.

This study was designed to determine whether a silicon accurate depth <b>knife</b> has equivalent performance characteristics when compared to a diamond limbal relaxing incision (LRI) <b>knife</b> and superior performance characteristics when compared to a steel accurate depth <b>knife</b> when creating limbal relaxing incision. Methods Sixty-five ophthalmic surgeons with limbal relaxing incision experience created limbal relaxing incisions in ex-vivo porcine eyes with silicon and steel accurate depth <b>knives</b> and diamond LRI <b>knives.</b> The ophthalmic surgeons rated multiple performance characteristics of the <b>knives</b> on Visual Analog Scales. Results The observed differences between the silicon <b>knife</b> and diamond <b>knife</b> were found to be insignificant. The mean ratio between the performance of the silicon <b>knife</b> and the diamond <b>knife</b> was shown to be greater than 90 % (with 95 % confidence). The silicon <b>knife's</b> mean performance was significantly higher than the performance of the steel <b>knife</b> for all characteristics.
