5|$|Observers {{hoped that}} the impacts would give them a <b>first</b> <b>glimpse</b> of Jupiter beneath the cloud tops, as lower {{material}} was exposed by the comet fragments punching through the upper atmosphere. Spectroscopic studies revealed absorption lines in the Jovian spectrum due to diatomic sulfur (S2) and carbon disulfide (CS2), the first detection of either in Jupiter, and only the second detection of S2 in any astronomical object. Other molecules detected included ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The amount of sulfur implied by the quantities of these compounds was {{much greater than the}} amount that would be expected in a small cometary nucleus, showing that material from within Jupiter was being revealed. Oxygen-bearing molecules such as sulfur dioxide were not detected, to the surprise of astronomers.|$|E
5|$|Gatiss {{originally}} resisted having Dickens {{star in the}} episode, as {{traditionally the}} Doctor only mentioned meeting historical figures, but he eventually warmed to the idea. As A Christmas Carol fan, Gatiss wanted to set the episode at Christmas. He later realised that Dickens' journey in the episode mirrored that of Ebenezer Scrooge. In one scene, Gatiss wanted the knocker on a door behind Dickens to briefly show the Gelth's face in reference to A Christmas Carol, but this visual effect was not done. The episode originally began in the TARDIS, as Gatiss wanted the <b>first</b> <b>glimpse</b> of 1860 to be through Rose's eyes. While this changed, Gatiss still wanted to show how great travelling in time is. It was scripted that snow would blow into the TARDIS when the doors opened, but this was cut because of budget reasons. Davies requested {{a scene in which}} the Doctor takes Rose to the future to see a world filled with walking corpses— the result if they had left before defeating the Gelth— but this was too expensive to film. During the scene in which the Doctor and Dickens are talking in the coach, the driver was supposed to shout down to them (referencing a Dickens work) and the coach was to crash, but this was also too expensive.|$|E

25|$|In April 2014, a <b>first</b> <b>glimpse</b> {{into the}} epigenetics of the Denisovan was gained with the {{publication}} of the full DNA methylation of the Denisovan and the Neanderthal. The reconstructed DNA methylation map allowed researchers to assess gene activity levels throughout the Denisovan genome and compare them to modern humans and to the Neanderthal. The reconstruction was possible thanks to the natural degradation processes of ancient DNA, which leave different signals on methylated vs. unmethylated regions of the genome. The study found ≈200 genes that show distinct regulatory patterns in the Denisovan.|$|E

Murrow immediately sent Shirer to London, where he delivered an uncensored, eyewitness account of the Anschluss. Murrow then chartered the only transportation available, a 23-passenger plane, to fly from Warsaw to Vienna so he could take over for Shirer.|$|E

500|$|Gauguin's figure {{seems to}} invoke the Polynesian goddess Hina, {{depicted}} by Morice as a Diana-like deity clutching a wolf cub, [...] "monstrous and majestic, drunk with pride, rage and sorrow". He titled an 1894 self-portrait in plaster as Oviri. The original is lost {{but a number of}} bronze casts survive. He used double mirrors to capture his familiar Inca profile, the result reprising his Jug in the Form of a Head, Self-Portrait. This was one of the earliest occasions Gauguin applied the term Oviri to himself. [...] "Gauguin sometimes also referred to himself as Oviri, the savage...", writes Merete Bodelsen. The Stuttgart version of his 1892 oil painting E haere oe i hia (Where Are You Going?) depicts a woman clutching a wolf cub. Pollitt remarks that this stocky, sculptural and androgynous figure gives a <b>first</b> <b>glimpse</b> of Oviri.|$|E

[...] His $400 per year salary did not satisfy his ambition, and in the spring of 1904, after {{two and a half years}} on the job, he decided that he wanted a university education. [...] His teaching salary was not sufficient to finance this, so he spent the summer of 1904 selling a one volume encyclopaedia in the newly settled areas around Rapid City, Manitoba. [...] Besides providing him with the income he required—he was a patient, effective salesman and later boasted that he was never thrown off of a farm—the job gave the now 21-year-old Brownlee his <b>first</b> <b>glimpse</b> of Western Canada.

500|$|Anasara, a {{derivative}} of the Sanskrit word [...] "Anabasara", literally means vacation. Every {{year after the}} holy Snana Yatra, the triad images, without the Sudarshana Chakra, are taken to a secret altar named Anavasara Ghar (also known as Anasara pindi, 'pindi' is Oriya term meaning [...] "platform" [...] ) where they remain for the next fortnight of (Krishna paksha); devotees {{are not allowed to}} view these images. Instead, devotees go to the nearby Brahmagiri to see the Lord in the four-handed form of Alarnath, a depiction of Vishnu. Devotees then get the <b>first</b> <b>glimpse</b> of the Lord only on the day before Rath Yatra, which is called Navayouvana. It is a local belief that the gods suffer from fever after taking an elaborate ritual bath, and they are treated by the special servants, the Daitapatis, for 15 days. Daitapatis perform special nitis (rites) known as Netrotchhaba (a rite of painting the eyes of the triad). During this period cooked food is not offered to the deities.|$|E
500|$|The {{greatest}} {{legacy of}} the herbal is to botany. Up to the seventeenth century, botany and medicine were {{one and the same}} but gradually greater emphasis was placed on the plants rather than their medicinal properties. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, plant description and classification began to relate plants to one another and not to man. This was the <b>first</b> <b>glimpse</b> of non-anthropocentric botanical science since Theophrastus and, coupled with the new system of binomial nomenclature, resulted in [...] "scientific herbals" [...] called Floras that detailed and illustrated the plants growing in a particular region. These books were often backed by herbaria, collections of dried plants that verified the plant descriptions given in the Floras. In this way modern botany, especially plant taxonomy, was born out of medicine. As herbal historian Agnes Arber remarks – [...] "Sibthorp's monumental Flora Graeca is, indeed, the direct descendant in modern science of the De Materia Medica of Dioscorides." ...|$|E

500|$|The Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844 {{had been}} written between April and August 1844, but soon Marx {{recognised}} that the Manuscripts had been influenced by some inconsistent ideas of Ludwig Feuerbach. [...] Accordingly, Marx recognised the need to break with Feuerbach's philosophy in favour of historical materialism, thus a year later (in April 1845) after moving from Paris to Brussels, Marx wrote his eleven [...] "Theses on Feuerbach". [...] The [...] "Theses on Feuerbach" [...] are best known for Thesis 11, which states that [...] "philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways, {{the point is to}} change it". This work contains Marx's criticism of materialism (for being contemplative), idealism (for reducing practice to theory) overall, criticising philosophy for putting abstract reality above the physical world. It thus introduced the <b>first</b> <b>glimpse</b> at Marx's historical materialism, an argument that the world is changed not by ideas but by actual, physical, material activity and practice. In 1845, after receiving a request from the Prussian king, the French government shut down Vorwärts!, with the interior minister, François Guizot, expelling Marx from France. At this point, Marx moved from Paris to Brussels, where Marx hoped to once again continue his study of capitalism and political economy.|$|E
500|$|In {{the season}} ten premiere, the {{audience}} got its <b>first</b> <b>glimpse</b> {{of the traditional}} Superman costume, which was left for Clark by Martha in the season nine finale. Although the suit was briefly seen through a reflection in Clark's eyes in the season nine finale, the suit {{that appeared in the}} season ten premiere was a different design. The producers, working alongside Warner Bros. and DC Comics, procured the costume worn by Brandon Routh in Superman Returns, which the team chose over the Christopher Reeve suit of the 1980s. DC Comics offered the suit worn by Reeve, but Peterson explained that it [...] "... just didn't quite fit with our world." [...] According to producer Kelly Souders, [...] "Well, the process was really a group effort. We worked with DC, and we have Alicia Louis, who does a lot of stuff for us at the studio, and who was really instrumental. It took quite a bit to get that costume. There's a lot of sign-offs, it really was Warner Bros. and DC and us working to make it happen." [...] Peterson stated that the costume plays a more prominent role in the final season, with the last scene of Smallville ending with Clark wearing it. Before then, Clark began wearing a new costume in the season ten episode [...] "Shield". Here, Clark replaced the black trenchoat with a red leather jacket, and the [...] "S" [...] shield now embossed onto the chest of that jacket.|$|E
