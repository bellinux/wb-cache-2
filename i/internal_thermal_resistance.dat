40|$|The {{efficiency}} of a Thermoelectric Module (TEM) {{is not only}} influenced by the material properties, {{but also by the}} heat losses due to the <b>internal</b> and contact <b>thermal</b> <b>resistances.</b> In the literature, the material properties are mostly discussed, mainly to increase the well-known thermoelectric figure of merit ZT. Nevertheless, when a TEM is considered, the separate characterization of the materials of the p and n elements is not enough to have a suitable TEM electrical model and evaluate more precisely its efficiency. Only a few recent papers deal with <b>thermal</b> <b>resistances</b> and their influence on the TEM efficiency; mostly, the minimization of these resistances is recommended, without giving a way to determine their values. The aim of the present paper is to identify the <b>internal</b> and contact <b>thermal</b> <b>resistances</b> of a TEM by electrical characterization. Depending on the applications, the TEM can be used either under constant temperature gradient or constant heat flow conditions. The proposed identification approach is based on the theoretical electrical modeling of the TEM, in both conditions. It is simple to implement, because it is based only on open circuit test conditions. A single electrical measurement under both conditions (constant-temperature and constant-heat) is needed.

40|$|The {{borehole}} {{thermal resistance}} – that is, the thermal resistance between the fluid in the U-tube and the borehole wall – {{is both a}} key performance characteristic of a closed-loop borehole ground heat exchanger and an important design parameter. Lower borehole thermal resistance leads to better system performance and/or lower total borehole length and possibly lower installation costs. Borehole thermal resistance may be determined using in situ thermal response testing, but for design purposes, {{it is important to}} be able to predict the borehole thermal resistance prior to installation. Due to the complexity of calculating it, numerous simplified methods have been proposed. This paper reviews published methods for calculating borehole thermal resistance for grouted boreholes with single U-tubes and compares their results against a rigorous analytical method. Another quantity that is particularly important for deep boreholes is the <b>internal</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>resistance</b> – that is, the thermal resistance between the upward-flowing and downward-flowing fluid paths in the borehole. Short-circuiting between the two legs has the effect of reducing the total heat transfer and can be quantified as an adjustment to the borehole thermal resistance, resulting in an effective borehole thermal resistance. A few simplified methods for calculating <b>internal</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>resistance</b> are compared against a rigorous analytical method. The simplified methods for calculating both borehole thermal resistance and <b>internal</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>resistance</b> are compared in parametric studies spanning the range of borehole diameters, pipe spacing, ground thermal conductivities and grout thermal conductivities found in practice. Many of the simplified methods work well with some combinations of parameters and poorly with others.

However, technical barriers {{still have to be}} addressed for those reductions to provide savings on installation costs. The coaxial GHEs with a borehole diameter of 203.2  mm (8 in.) showed most advantages associated with borehole <b>thermal</b> <b>resistance</b> and heat storage capacity. Commercial drilling capacity available in North America may need to accommodate larger boreholes for coaxial GHEs to be installed at competitive cost. Assembling HDPE pipes with a large diameter can complicate the installation process because large pipes are commonly shipped in sections to be joined with fusion tools in the field. The double U-pipe GHEs were shown to provide slightly smaller but similar advantages for the total borehole length reduction (up to 20 %), especially when considering thermally enhanced pipe and deeper boreholes. While efficient technology to install coaxial GHEs may not be available at the moment, installation of double U-pipe GHE can be achieved with current tools and expertise. The drilling depth is an important factor for balancing flow rate of both double U-pipe and coaxial GHEs. Determining the depth at which this practice remains economical would require further research. In any cases, the thermally enhanced pipe was shown to be an asset for the alternative GHE configurations studied.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} appropriate cooling solutions for 3 D chip stacks in various cases, {{it is important to}} have a better understanding of the total <b>thermal</b> <b>resistance</b> of a 3 D chip stack. For this purpose, precise <b>thermal</b> <b>resistance</b> measure-ments and modeling of each component of a 3 D chip stack are important. The <b>thermal</b> <b>resistance</b> of interconnection is considered to be one of the <b>thermal</b> <b>resistance</b> bottlenecks of a 3 D chip stack. In this study, a steady-state thermal resis-tance measurement method is employed for the <b>thermal</b> <b>resistance</b> measurement of interconnection. The <b>thermal</b> <b>resistance</b> of the 200 μ m pitch C 4 ’s (Pb 97 Sn 3) jointed samples are measured and the thermal conductivity of C 4 ’s is derived to be 18 – 24 W/mK. With regard to the <b>thermal</b> <b>resistance</b> of a silicon substrate, the <b>thermal</b> <b>resistance</b> of a silicon substrate with various interconnection pitches and diameters has already been modeled by considering the con-centrated heat flow to interconnection, as presented in ICEP 2008. [15] Based on the modeled data, the <b>thermal</b> <b>resistance</b> reduction by underfill with various interconnection pitches and diameters is also studied...|$|R
