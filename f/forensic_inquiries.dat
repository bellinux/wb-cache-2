Despite the conclusions of independent <b>forensic</b> <b>inquiries</b> and the eventual corroborating admission by the Russian Navy that the explosion was triggered by a faulty torpedo on board the Kursk, various conspiracy theories posit that Kursk was actually sunk by one of the US or British submarines. This may partly stem from the Russian Navy's initial attempts to shunt away criticism of its failed efforts to rescue the surviving crew members from the ocean floor and of the generally poor condition of its own equipment, which was eventually found to be the cause of both the sinking and the failure of the Russian rescue attempts. [...] In the days immediately after the explosion, Russia suggested that the cause of the disaster was a collision with one of the US or British submarines present. [...] Though the accusation proved to be unfounded, conspiracy theorists have picked up on and elaborated it in various directions over time.|$|E

50|$|<b>Forensic</b> <b>inquiry</b> {{into the}} failed process or product is the {{starting}} point of failure analysis. Such inquiry is conducted using scientific analytical methods such as electrical and mechanical measurements, or by analysing failure data such as product reject reports or examples of previous failures of the same kind. The methods of forensic engineering are especially valuable in tracing product defects and flaws. They may include fatigue cracks, brittle cracks produced by stress corrosion cracking or environmental stress cracking for example. Witness statements can be valuable for reconstructing the likely sequence of events and hence the chain of cause and effect. Human factors can also be assessed when the cause of the failure is determined. There are several useful methods to prevent product failures occurring in the first place, including failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) and fault tree analysis (FTA), methods which can be used during prototyping to analyse failures before a product is marketed.|$|R

40|$|Free will is {{regarded}} {{by some as}} the most and by others as the least relevant concept for criminal responsibility. Contributions from religious and philosophical thinkers over the classical and medieval Christian eras demonstrate that, despite the passionate and historically consequential debates {{over the meaning of}} “freedom, ” the unifying theme that joined the will with the intellect remained persistent and pervasive. Leading historical jurists in England eventually dropped the descriptor “free, ” but retained the central importance of the will to criminal responsibility and emphasized its dependence on the intellect to function properly. Modern rationalist philosophers denied the will’s metaphysical freedom, but not its existence. Today the neurosciences reveal more and more about how the will functions, even as lawyers and psychiatrists hesitate to utter the word. In properly avoiding metaphysical freedom within <b>forensic</b> <b>inquiry</b> and discourse, it is a grave conceptual mistake to overlook the will itself. Once greater conceptual clarity on the empirical nature of the will is achieved and accepted, the law itself could rediscover the core mental faculty behind human agency, the will.

40|$|Representations of {{forensic}} procedures saturate popular culture in both fiction and true crime. One {{of the most}} striking forensic tools used in these narratives is the chemical luminol, so named because it glows an eerie greenish-blue when it comes into contact with the tiniest drops of human blood. Luminol is a deeply ambivalent object: it is both a tool of the police, historically abused and misappropriated, and yet it offers hope to families of victims by allowing hidden crimes to surface. Forensic enquiry can exonerate those falsely accused of crimes, and yet the rise {{of forensic}} science is synonymous with the development of the deeply racist ‘science’ of eugenics. Luminol Theory investigates the possibility of using a tool of the state in subversive, or radical, ways. By introducing luminol as an agent of <b>forensic</b> <b>inquiry,</b> Luminol Theory approaches the exploratory stages that a crime scene investigation might take, exploring experimental literature as though these texts were ‘crime scenes’ in order to discover what this deeply strange object can tell us about crime, death, and history, to make visible violent crimes, and to offer a tangible encounter with death and finitude. At the luminol-drenched crime scene, flashes of illumination throw up words, sentences, and fragments that offer luminous, strange glimpses, bobbing up from below their polished surfaces. When luminol shines its light, it reveals, it is magical, it is prescient, and it has a nasty allure...|$|R
40|$|Inquiry-based {{learning}} {{is considered a}} useful technique to strengthen the critical thinking skills of students. The National Science Standards emphasize its use and the complexities and challenge it provides are well suited for {{meeting the needs of}} the gifted. While many studies have documented the effectiveness of this type of instruction, {{there is a lack of}} research on growth in higher-order thinking through participation in science inquiry. This study investigated such growth among a small group of gifted fifth-grade students. ^ In this study a group of fifth-grade gifted science students completed a series of three <b>forensics</b> <b>inquiry</b> lessons, and documented questions, ideas and reflections as they constructed evidence to solve a crime. From this class of students, one small group was purposely selected to serve as the focus of the study. Using qualitative techniques, the questions and statements students made as they interacted in the activity were analyzed. Videotaped comments and student logs were coded for emerging patterns and also examined for evidence of increased levels of higher-order thinking based on a rubric that was designed using the six levels of Bloom 2 ̆ 7 s Taxonomy. ^ Evidence from this study showed marked increase in and deeper levels of higher-order thinking for two of the students. The other boy and girl showed progress using the inquiry activities, but it was not as evident. The social dynamics of the group seemed to hinder one girl 2 ̆ 7 s participation during some of the activities. The social interactions played a role in strengthening the exchange of ideas and thinking skills for the others. The teacher had a tremendous influence over the production of higher-level statements by modeling that level of thinking as she questioned the students. Through her practice of answering a question with a question, she gradually solicited more analytical thinking from her students. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{biological}} profile {{alone is}} not always enough to reconstruct individual identity and cause of death from <b>forensic</b> cases. Ethnographic <b>inquiry</b> of context can be essential, especially for poorly recovered and temporally historic remains. This case study {{provides an example of}} the usefulness of ethnographic inquiry in building a contextual reconstruction of identity. For the case at hand, human skeletal remains, minimal clothing, and a rifle were recovered in the 19802 ̆ 7 s from Albion Idaho. Through standard methods for reconstruction of the biological profile, the individual was identified as a missing male of 30 - 44 years of age, who disappeared in the winter of 1920. As part of the subsequent investigation, with use of scene photography, analysis of skeletal weathering, and interviews with local ranchers, it was possible to narrow down personal identification and construct a plausible scenario of death. Results of combined skeletal, contextual, and ethnographic data suggest that the individual was a local Ferrier who was unexpectedly trapped during a hunting trip due to a change in weather. Specifically, the individual most likely succumbed to hypothermia and exposure, but only after attempting to start a fire with his rifle, a common yet little known local practice. This case study can demonstrates to both law enforcement and other investigators how important situational and cultural contextual data can become when identifying skeletal remains and cause of death...|$|R
2500|$|On August 30, 2011, it was {{announced}} that ABC bought Moore's pitch for Hangtown, a Western drama series. Hangtown is the third potential venture to be attempted under the deal between Moore's production company, Tall Ship Productions, and Sony Pictures TV. The series was co-created by Ron D. Moore and former Caprica writer Matt Roberts. Hangtown is described as [...] "a Western with procedural elements" [...] that takes place in a frontier town in the early 1900s grappling with the development of the railroad. The potential series would revolve around the town's old-fashioned veteran marshal who solves crimes by drawing on instinct and experience, who butt heads with the young new East Coast crime-solving doctor who relies on emerging <b>forensics</b> and rational <b>inquiry.</b> Added to the mix is a young female writer who has come to the west to write pulp stories about stereotyped [...] "Wild West" [...] crime, to send back to big city dime-novel publishers back East. Tall Ship Productions announced via their Twitter-feed on October 18, 2011, that Justin Lin, director of several films in The Fast and the Furious franchise, had signed on to direct a potential pilot episode of Hangtown, in the event that ABC officially orders it. [...] However, The Hollywood Reporter and Wired.com pointed out that Hangtown would be facing stiff competition, as a half-dozen other potential Western series were currently in development from all major networks as well as several cable channels, as part of a general wave of revitalized interest in the genre. (Apart from AMC's Western-genre series Hell On Wheels, which had already garnered critical praise after its premiere in November 2011, TNT was developing the series Gateway, CBS was developing Ralph Lamb, and NBC was developing an as-yet untitled Western from Friday Night Lights producer Peter Berg. Moreover, ABC itself was already developing another Western series, Gunslinger, which might affect its choice of whether to pick up a second Western show produced by Moore, similar to how a wave of new fantasy-genre series were pitched to major networks in early 2011, such as ABC's Once Upon a Time, and NBC was faced with two potential fantasy series, Grimm or Moore's own 17th Precinct. Due to this heavy competition, NBC chose not to pick up 17th Precinct for a full series.) In an interview with Wire.com on September 29, 2012, Moore was asked about the status of his proposed Western series The Wild Wild West (reboot for CBS) and Hangtown (for ABC), and stated that the projects had been cancelled. Moore said, [...] "Yeah, ABC decided not to go with it. That was very frustrating. They made a strategic decision that they didn’t want to do a Western, period. Because they said they loved the script and the characters, and said they bought three Westerns because they were so committed to it. But at some point, they just got cold feet and said they weren’t going to do Westerns after all, which was really disappointing." ...|$|R
