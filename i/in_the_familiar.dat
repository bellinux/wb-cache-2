5|$|Originally {{commissioned}} {{near the}} end of the Seven Years' War, Lowestoffe patrolled in British waters until 1773, when it underwent repairs. She was recommissioned in 1777 and served throughout the American War of Independence, including at the Battle of San Fernando de Omoa. After the bulk of the fighting ended, she returned home to Portsmouth in 1782, and did not see battle for the next decade. She spent most of her later years in British and Mediterranean waters, winning particular glory for her part in an engagement with two French frigates in 1795. Her final duties were back <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>familiar</b> waters of the West Indies, where she was wrecked in 1801 while escorting a convoy in the Caicos Islands.|$|E

25|$|Cacao pods are {{harvested}} by cutting {{them from the}} tree using a machete, or by knocking them off the tree using a stick. The beans with their surrounding pulp are removed from the pods and placed in piles or bins, allowing access to micro-organisms so fermentation of the pectin-containing material can begin. Yeasts produce ethanol, lactic acid bacteria produce lactic acid, and acetic acid bacteria produce acetic acid. The fermentation process, which takes up to seven days, also produces several flavor precursors, eventually resulting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>familiar</b> chocolate taste.|$|E
25|$|In the BBC/HBO TV series Rome, Lepidus (Ronan Vibert) {{is portrayed}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>familiar</b> way, as an {{inadequate}} rival for the powerhouses of Octavian and Antony. Much of {{his involvement in}} the second Triumvirate is barely mentioned in the series. No mention is made of his alliance with Antony and Caesar before the assassination. He is depicted as a general sent to defeat the weakened Antony after Mutina. His whole army immediately defects to his enemy. He appears sporadically as a barely-noticed participant in later discussions about future plans.|$|E
25|$|Of the façade by Alessandro Galilei (1735), the cliché {{assessment}} {{has ever}} been {{that it is the}} façade of a palace, not of a church. Galilei's front, which is a screen across the older front creating a narthex or vestibule, does express the nave and double aisles of the archbasilica, which required a central bay wider {{than the rest of the}} sequence. Galilei provided it, without abandoning the range of identical arch-headed openings, by extending the central window by flanking columns that support the arch, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>familiar</b> Serlian motif.|$|E

25|$|The exact date of {{the wedding}} of Anne Neville and Richard, Duke of Gloucester, is not known, {{although}} most sources agree that a ceremony {{took place in the}} spring of 1472 in the chapel of St Stephen in Westminster Palace. The couple made their marital home <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>familiar</b> surroundings of Middleham Castle, Yorkshire, after Richard was appointed Governor of the North on the king's behalf. Upon her marriage, Anne was styled Duchess of Gloucester. They had only one child, Edward, born at Middleham allegedly sometime in 1473, but more probably in 1476. Anne's mother, the dowager Countess of Warwick, joined her daughter's household in 1473 after Richard obtained the king's permission to release his mother-in-law from her guarded sanctuary.|$|E

At Main Street Cinema several of Mickey's short films are shown on a rotating basis; the sixth film is always Steamboat Willie. Mickey plays {{a central role}} in Fantasmic! (Disneyland Resort, Disney's Hollywood Studios) a live nighttime show which famously features Mickey in his role as the Sorcerer's Apprentice. Mickey was also a central character in the now-defunct Mickey Mouse Revue (Magic Kingdom, Tokyo Disneyland) which was an indoor show featuring animatronic characters. Mickey's face currently graces the Mickey's Fun Wheel at Disney California Adventure Park, where a figure of him also stands on top of Silly Symphony Swings.|$|E
25|$|Compton Street, {{also known}} as the Popular or Pop Side, had a {{capacity}} of around 1,000 at the time of closure - the smallest of the four sides. It was partly covered (to the rear) and had a row of supporting pillars. Originally a terrace constructed in the early 1920s, Compton Street had a lot of work carried out on it during 2002 and was made all seated. The seating area lay about 4 metres from the pitch line. The roof had an unusual wooden television gantry perched on top. Until becoming a seated area, supporters could move freely between Compton Street and the Kop, resulting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>familiar</b> half-time sight of fans flowing from the former to the latter for an improved view of the away goal.|$|E

25|$|Heterosis, or {{hybrid vigor}} (as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>familiar</b> F1 hybrids of maize), occurs in common (hexaploid) wheat, {{but it is}} {{difficult}} to produce seed of hybrid cultivars on a commercial scale (as is done with maize) because wheat flowers are perfect and normally self-pollinate. Commercial hybrid wheat seed has been produced using chemical hybridizing agents; these chemicals selectively interfere with pollen development, or naturally occurring cytoplasmic male sterility systems. Hybrid wheat has been a limited commercial success in Europe (particularly France), the United States and South Africa. F1 hybrid wheat cultivars should not be confused with the standard method of breeding inbred wheat cultivars by crossing two lines using hand emasculation, then selfing or inbreeding the progeny many (ten or more) generations before release selections are identified to be released as a variety or cultivar.|$|E
25|$|Vee {{was born}} and raised in the Los Angeles area, growing up in Norwalk. When she was younger she wanted to become an animator, but after {{watching}} Sailor Moon, she was inspired to go into voice acting. She had attended Anime Expo multiple times as a fan, and participated in their AX Idol voice-over contest. In 2004, she joined a voice-over panel where she helped work some of the equipment and then got a card from Wendee Lee to audition for several shows with Bang Zoom! Entertainment, including Samurai Champloo. Her first major role was Kanaria in Rozen Maiden. She studied Theatre Arts and graduated from California State University at Long Beach in 2007. In 2008, she voiced the title character in , Louise <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Familiar</b> of Zero and Nanoha in Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha. She portrayed the live-action Haruhi Suzumiya in the promotional videos for the second The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya series, and performed as her at various events.|$|E
25|$|Because wheat self-pollinates, {{creating}} hybrid varieties {{is extremely}} labor-intensive; {{the high cost}} of hybrid wheat seed relative to its moderate benefits have kept farmers from adopting them widely despite nearly 90 years of effort. F1 hybrid wheat cultivars {{should not be confused with}} wheat cultivars deriving from standard plant breeding. Heterosis or hybrid vigor (as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>familiar</b> F1 hybrids of maize) occurs in common (hexaploid) wheat, but it is difficult to produce seed of hybrid cultivars on a commercial scale as is done with maize because wheat flowers are perfect in the botanical sense, meaning they have both male and female parts, and normally self-pollinate. Commercial hybrid wheat seed has been produced using chemical hybridizing agents, plant growth regulators that selectively interfere with pollen development, or naturally occurring cytoplasmic male sterility systems. Hybrid wheat has been a limited commercial success in Europe (particularly France), the United States and South Africa.|$|E

25|$|John Paul II's {{body was}} clothed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>familiar</b> white soutane, over which was placed a plain white alb. A stole, {{the symbol of}} ordained ministry, was placed around his neck. Over the inner vestments, John Paul II was clothed in a red chasuble. An ancient Byzantine custom, red is the colour of {{mourning}} for Popes. Around his collar, the pallium of white lamb's wool was draped. A white zucchetto and a white bishop's mitre adorned John Paul II's head. In his arm rested Paul VI's pastoral cross-staff, used by popes {{in place of the}} crozier. His hands clasped a rosary. At first, he lay in state in his favourite pair of Polish-made brown leather shoes, size 44-1/2, which he wore on his travels throughout the world. Later, following the example of his immediate predecessors, these were changed to plain red leather papal shoes.|$|E
25|$|Knudtzon {{was shown}} {{definitively}} {{to have been}} correct when a large quantity of tablets written <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>familiar</b> Akkadian cuneiform script but in an unknown language was discovered by Hugo Winckler at the modern village of Boğazköy, the former site of Hattusa, {{the capital of the}} Hittite Empire. Based on a study of this extensive material, Bedřich Hrozný succeeded in analyzing the language. He presented his argument that the language is Indo-European in a paper published in 1915 (Hrozný 1915), which was soon followed by a grammar of the language (Hrozný 1917). Hrozný's argument for the Indo-European affiliation of Hittite was thoroughly modern, though poorly substantiated. He focused on the striking similarities in idiosyncratic aspects of the morphology, unlikely to occur independently by chance and unlikely to be borrowed. These included the r/n alternation in some noun stems (the heteroclitics) and vocalic ablaut, both seen in the alternation in the word for water between nominative singular, wadar and genitive singular, wedenas. He also presented a set of regular sound correspondences. After a brief initial delay due to the disruption caused by the First World War, Hrozný's decipherment, tentative grammatical analysis, and demonstration of the Indo-European affiliation of Hittite were rapidly accepted and more broadly substantiated by contemporary scholars such as Edgar H. Sturtevant who authored the first scientifically acceptable Hittite grammar with a chrestomathy and a glossary. The most up-to-date grammar of the Hittite language is currently Hoffner and Melchert 2008.|$|E

500|$|... 343 Guilty Spark (or Guilty Spark) (voiced by Tim Dadabo) is a robot {{character}} who {{appears in the}} original Halo trilogy. 343 Guilty Spark is an artificial intelligence designed to serve Forerunners. His identity module was sourced from a human named Chakas, who was composed by the Didact, {{which is to say}} that he was digitized at the expense of his biological form. Guilty Spark was fragmented into several independently operating fragments, one of which was uploaded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>familiar,</b> floating, blue-eyed, geometric orb, first encountered in Halo: Combat Evolved, and assigned to Installation 04 (codenamed Alpha Halo) under the title of Monitor. Although an identity module is required for an artificial intelligence to operate, it may occasionally lead to complications arising from free will – for example, the containment of a Flood outbreak should always assume the highest priority for a Monitor; however, in a moment of weakness he disregarded his assigned prioritization, in favour of preserving the structural integrity of the replacement Installation.|$|E
