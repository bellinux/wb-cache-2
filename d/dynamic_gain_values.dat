30|$|Our work {{supports}} {{two ways}} to obtain the gain values: (1) Automatic. To be specific, the automatic ways to obtain the gain values are many. One often used is profiling. Online profiling can obtain <b>dynamic</b> <b>gain</b> <b>values,</b> but its running cost is very expensive. Offline profiling is more suitable in the context our work targeted. However, it still requires much preparatory work such as probe-like instrument. What should be noted is that, RSpring leverages only the results of profiling (i.e., a sequence of ACs with comparable gain values). Thus the profiling itself is not our focus. In addition, our work has another way to assign the gain values based on an AC’s maturity [2] (which implies the importance and cost-effectiveness of the AC to the whole system). For instance, if an AC has all the four functions of the autonomic control loop, while another AC has only the monitor function, the former will be assigned a bigger gain value than the latter. (2) Manual. It requires administrators to assign the gain values, {{because they are the}} best candidate to know which AC can contribute most to system performance and to what extent. Such labor-based work is not much and not difficult, because the gain values are used for comparison, which can be assigned approximately.|$|E

A new strategy has been developed to aid in allowing a reusable launch vehicle to complete the Trajectory Area Energy Management (TAEM) phase of reentry. Using the new trajectory planning and tracking strategy, the reusable launch vehicle will complete TAEM with a higher degree of accuracy than what has been accomplished in the past. The reusable launch vehicle will also be better prepared to adapt to unpredictable conditions, which in the past were a hindrance to an accurate and safe reentry. The new strategy is composed of two distinct components. The first component provides the vehicle with a new way to track the Heading Alignment Cone (HAC) using <b>dynamic</b> <b>gain</b> <b>values.</b> The new dynamic gains values are found through a combination of linearization, state-space representation, and pole-placement. The second component provides the vehicle with an extremely accurate groundtrack predictor. The groundtrack predictor allows the vehicle to accurately determine an ideal trajectory to the next reentry phase, Approach and Landing. The groundtrack predictor utilizes a combination of HAC size and location modifications in order to provide the vehicle with an accurate prediction...|$|E

This paper builds on previous research on the <b>dynamic</b> <b>gains</b> from trade by moving beyond a single country basis to examine impacts on firm-level productivity for a cross-section of countries.

40|$|Both <b>gain</b> {{transient}} and <b>dynamic</b> <b>gain</b> {{control devices}} were also designed and fabricated as photonic integrated circuits (PICs). Silicon-based PICs {{were able to}} perform <b>dynamic</b> <b>gain</b> tilt compensation by thermo-optic effect. Helium doped SOI rib waveguides were used for power monitoring and is potentially used as monolithic gain tilt compensation device with arrayed waveguide grating (AWG). <b>Dynamic</b> <b>gain</b> tilt induced by wavelength dependent gain of EDFA leads to power penalty in wavelength division multiplexed systems. Using optical filter with known spectral response, {{it is possible to}} detect <b>dynamic</b> <b>gain</b> tilt and a per-band compensation scheme using electronic variable optical attenuators. This was implemented for <b>dynamic</b> <b>gain</b> tilt compensation (DGTC). Dynamic provisioning of bandwidth and re-configurable optical networks can potentially allow efficient and cost effective deliveries of services based on the actual bandwidth requirement. Optical add/drop multiplexers (OADM) and optical cross-connects (OXC) will be used for such networks but the dynamic provisioning of optical channels may introduce optical power transients because of the slow gain dynamics of erbium doped fiber amplifiers. In this dissertation, the potential problems on using Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifiers (EDFA) in future reconfigurable optical networks are studied and possible solutions are assessed. In particular, the problems of <b>gain</b> transient and <b>dynamic</b> <b>gain</b> tilt were studied experimentally and theoretically. In saturated EDFA channel add/drop can produce average power fluctuations, in timescales in the microsecond range. The thesis describes how gain transients can be minimized in gain clamped EDFA by optimizing erbium concentrations of EDF. Both simulations and experiments demonstrate that highly doped EDF minimize the transient in gain clamped EDFA. For unclamped EDFA, all-optical feedforward constant output power compensation has been successfully demonstrated using electronic variable optical attenuator (EVOA). Chan Po Shan. "August 2006.

40|$|The {{response}} of a neuronal population over {{a space of}} inputs depends on the intrinsic prop-erties of its constituent neurons. Two main modes of single neuron dynamics–integration and resonance–have been distinguished. While resonator cell types exist {{in a variety of}} brain areas, few models incorporate this feature and fewer have investigated its effects. To understand better how a resonator’s frequency preference emerges from its intrinsic dynamics and contributes to its local area’s population firing rate dynamics, we analyze the <b>dynamic</b> <b>gain</b> of an analytically solvable two-degree of freedom neuron model. In the Fok-ker-Planck approach, the <b>dynamic</b> <b>gain</b> is intractable. The alternative Gauss-Rice approach lifts the resetting of the voltage after a spike.

We find six distinct response types and use them to fully characterize the routes to resonance across all values of the relevant timescales.

To assess the stability of ventilatory drive in OSA pa-tients and controls, we used the pseudorandom binary stimulation (PRBS) test and examined the closed- and open-loop responses to hyperoxic hypercapnia. The closed-loop response is produced by interactions of <b>dynamic</b> <b>gain</b> in controller, plant, and ventilatory feedback. The open-loop response reflects controller <b>dynamic</b> <b>gain</b> or frequency-dependent chemosensitivity. As compared with 16 non-apneic, nonobese control subjects, a group of nine obese OSA patients had a higher peak response and a more rapid and irregular recovery phase of the closed-loop CO 2 response in the PRBS test. The two groups had similar open-loop responses in the PRBS test, suggesting that central dynamic CO 2 chemosensitivity was not abnormal in OSA. We conclude that the differences between OSA patients and controls in the closed-loop response in the PRBS test are not {{due to differences in}} <b>dynamic</b> con-troller <b>gain,</b> but are related to differences in <b>dynamic</b> plant <b>gain</b> and/or negative ventilatory feed-back.
