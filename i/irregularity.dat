5|$|Wobble or shimmy {{begins when}} some {{otherwise}} minor <b>irregularity,</b> such as fork asymmetry, accelerates {{the wheel to}} one side. The restoring force is applied in phase with {{the progress of the}} <b>irregularity,</b> and the wheel turns to the other side where the process is repeated. If there is insufficient damping in the steering the oscillation will increase until system failure occurs. The oscillation frequency can be changed by changing the forward speed, making the bike stiffer or lighter, or increasing the stiffness of the steering, of which the rider is a main component.|$|E
5|$|Betelgeuse is {{classified}} as a semiregular variable star, indicating that some periodicity is noticeable in the brightness changes, but amplitudes may vary, cycles may have different lengths, {{and there may be}} standstills or periods of <b>irregularity.</b> It is placed in subgroup SRc; these are pulsating red supergiants with amplitudes around one magnitude and periods from tens to hundreds of days.|$|E
30|$|During {{solar minimum}} conditions, post-midnight <b>irregularities</b> may occur mostly in {{association}} with plasma bubbles initiated around midnight. The statistical characteristics of these post-midnight <b>irregularities</b> can be summarized as follows: (1) The post-midnight <b>irregularities</b> occur frequently around the June solstice in low solar activity conditions. Their occurrence rate increases with decreasing solar activity. (2) The regions with <b>irregularities</b> move mostly westward. (3) The post-midnight <b>irregularities</b> do not accompany GPS scintillation or weak GPS scintillation.|$|R
40|$|The {{anisotropic}} {{effects of}} random density <b>irregularities</b> in causing Faraday polarization fluctuations of VHF radio signals are examined, taking both rod-like and sheet-like <b>irregularities</b> into consideration. It is {{found that the}} variance of Faraday polarization fluctuations depends on the ratio of perpendicular to parallel correlation lengths. The anisotropic effect of rod-like ionospheric <b>irregularities</b> are shown to be most appreciable for longitudinal propagation. The anisotropic effect of sheet-like ionospheric <b>irregularities,</b> however, is not strongly dependent on the radio propagation angle. During transionospheric propagation at large angles {{with respect to the}} geomagnetic field, sheet-like <b>irregularities</b> may cause greater Faraday polarization fluctuations than rod-like <b>irregularities...</b>|$|R
30|$|<b>Irregularities</b> in the high-latitude region {{may result}} from patches of plasma density, {{large-scale}} plasma blobs, and density troughs, whose steep edges are unstable, so that smaller scale density structures develop along these edges. These smaller scale <b>irregularities</b> cause intense scintillation effects. Individual patches of <b>irregularities</b> have lifetimes of 2 – 3  h; however, <b>irregularities</b> are seen to persist for periods of up to 8  h. These <b>irregularities</b> are not specifically related to space weather disturbances but do increase with the solar activity cycle.|$|R
5|$|In {{voting against}} the Force Bill, Tyler {{knew he would}} {{permanently}} alienate the pro-Jackson faction of the Virginia legislature, even those who had tolerated his <b>irregularity</b> up to this point. This jeopardized his re-election in February 1833, in which he faced the pro-administration Democrat James McDowell; however, with Clay's endorsement, Tyler was re-elected {{by a margin of}} 12 votes.|$|E
5|$|The Green is not {{perfectly}} rectangular, as {{its southern}} border along Wheelock Street runs {{slightly to the}} northeast rather than due east-west. This <b>irregularity</b> {{is due to the}} Town of Hanover's 1873 seizure of part of the southeast corner of the Green, which it used to straighten Wheelock Street. The Green had previously extended 30 feet (nine meters) farther south on that corner.|$|E
5|$|After qualifying, {{the race}} {{stewards}} {{decided not to}} give a penalty to Magnussen for crossing the pit light, since it had only changed to red 0.55 seconds before he crossed the pit exit line. Kvyat escaped penalty as well after his car failed the obligatory front floor deflection test. As the team pointed out, the <b>irregularity</b> {{was the result of}} an impact on track, allowing him to keep eighth on the grid.|$|E
40|$|The {{retarding}} potential analyzer aboard Ogo 6 {{has provided}} high-resolution {{observations of the}} ion concentration along the satellite path. Changes in ion concentration as small as 0. 03 % and at times as small as 0. 01 % could be measured. Spatial resolution varied from 35 to 380 m. Samples of data have been analyzed to determine the spectral properties of the F region <b>irregularities</b> observed. The most common frequency spectrum observed suggests that the responsible <b>irregularities</b> result from the turbulent dissipation of larger <b>irregularities.</b> At the equator, the larger <b>irregularities</b> are probably produced by convective electric fields. At high latitudes, electric fields may also be involved, but other factors such as precipitating particles may contribute to, or be primarily responsible for, the production of large <b>irregularities.</b> Examples {{of other types of}} spectra associated with wavelike <b>irregularities</b> and with 'ground glass' (high-frequency noise) <b>irregularities</b> are also shown...|$|R

5|$|Although Hancock won Georgia's {{popular vote}} easily, {{there was an}} <b>irregularity</b> in that state’s electoral votes. According to Article II, Section 1, clause 3 of the Constitution, “The Congress may {{determine}} the Time of choosing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States.” In 1792, Congress had set the date for the Electoral College {{to vote on the}} first Wednesday in December, which in 1880 fell on December 1. However, Georgia’s electors failed to cast their ballots on December 1, instead voting on the following Wednesday, December 8. Congress chose to count Georgia's vote in the official tally anyway; had they not done so, Hancock’s electoral vote would have been 144, not 155.|$|E
5|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) {{is useful for}} staging OCD lesions, evaluating {{the integrity of the}} joint surface, and distinguishing normal variants of bone formation from OCD by showing bone and cartilage edema {{in the area of the}} <b>irregularity.</b> MRI provides information regarding features of the articular cartilage and bone under the cartilage, including edema, fractures, fluid interfaces, articular surface integrity, and fragment displacement. A low T1 and high T2 signal at the fragment interface is seen in active lesions. This indicates an unstable lesion or recent microfractures. While MRI and arthroscopy have a close correlation, X-ray films tend to be less inductive of similar MRI results.|$|E

5|$|The {{minister}} {{charged with}} responsibility for the Act is required to publish in the Government Gazette a list stating the Government departments which are authorized departments {{for the purposes of}} the Act, and the names and addresses for service of the solicitors for the departments. As of 7 December 2005, no such list had been published. For this reason, in Chee Siok Chin v. Minister for Home Affairs (2005), decided on that date, the High Court held that instead of instituting the action against the Minister for Home Affairs and the Commissioner of Police, the applicants should have done so against the Attorney-General. Nonetheless, the suit should not be dismissed as this was a procedural <b>irregularity</b> that could be cured by substituting the Attorney-General as the respondent.|$|E
5|$|In April 1824, Rincón mayor Pedro García {{authorized}} {{the sale of}} a vessel owned by Juan Bautista de Salas to Pedro Ramírez. Ramírez, who may have {{been a member of the}} Ramírez de Arellano family, lived in Pedernales and was a neighbor of Cofresí's brothers and Cristobal Pabón Davila. On April 30, shortly after acquiring the ship, Ramírez sold it to Cofresí (who used it as a pirate flagship). The <b>irregularity</b> of the transactions was quickly noticed, prompting an investigation of García. The scandal weakened his already-frail authority, and Matías Conchuela intervened as the governor's representative. De la Torre asked the mayor of Añasco, Thomás de la Concha, to retrieve the records and verify their accuracy. The investigation, led by public prosecutor José Madrazo of the Regimiento de Granada's Military Anti-Piracy Commission, concluded with Bautista's imprisonment and sanctions for García. Several members of the Ramírez de Arellano family were prosecuted, including the former mayors of Añasco and Mayagüez (Manuel and José María), Tómas and Antonio. Others with the same last name but unclear parentage, such as Juan Lorenzo Ramirez, were also linked to Cofresí.|$|E
40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} {{that when the}} frequency spectrum of log amplitude fluctuations is used, the radio-occultation experiment is {{a powerful tool for}} detecting, identifying, and studying ionospheric <b>irregularities.</b> Analysis of Pioneer 10 radio-occultation measurements reveals that the Jovian ionosphere possesses electron-density <b>irregularities</b> which are very similar to those found in the earth's ionosphere. This is the first time such <b>irregularities</b> have been found in a planetary ionosphere other than that of the earth. The Pioneer 10 results indicate that the spatial wave-number spectrum of the electron-density <b>irregularities</b> is close to the Kolmogorov spectrum and that the outer scale size is greater than the Fresnel size (6. 15 km). This type of spectrum suggests that the <b>irregularities</b> are probably produced by the turbulent dissipation of <b>irregularities</b> larger than the outer scale size...|$|R
40|$|Review of in situ data {{obtained}} {{with the aid}} of the retarding potential analyzer on board Ogo 6 which reveal the nature of ionospheric <b>irregularities</b> in the total ion concentration above 400 km. Except for the high-latitude regions, the ionosphere is usually observed to be very smooth in the daytime, but considerable structure is observed at night, particularly near the equator and at Atlantic longitudes. Although most of the <b>irregularities</b> observed appear to be stochastic in nature, many nearly monochromatic waveforms are observed near the equator. The topics discussed include the midlatitude scintillation boundary, large-amplitude equatorial <b>irregularities,</b> the fluctuation spectrum of typical F-region <b>irregularities,</b> the lower edge of the equatorial F region, sinusoidal waveforms, ground glass <b>irregularities,</b> breaking wave <b>irregularities,</b> and regions of smooth and irregular ionization inside the polar cap...|$|R
30|$|The {{magnetosphere}} substorm plays {{a crucial}} role in the solar wind energy dissipation into the ionosphere. We report on the intensity of the high-latitude ionospheric <b>irregularities</b> during one of the largest storms of the current solar cycle—the St. Patrick’s Day storm of 17 March 2015. The database of more than 2500 ground-based Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers was used to estimate the <b>irregularities</b> occurrence and dynamics over the auroral region of the Northern Hemisphere. We analyze the dependence of the GPS-detected ionospheric <b>irregularities</b> on the auroral activity. The development and intensity of the high-latitude <b>irregularities</b> during this geomagnetic storm reveal a high correlation with the auroral hemispheric power and auroral electrojet indices (0.84 and 0.79, respectively). Besides the ionospheric <b>irregularities</b> caused by particle precipitation inside the polar cap region, evidences of other <b>irregularities</b> related to the storm enhanced density (SED), formed at mid-latitudes and its further transportation in the form of tongue of ionization (TOI) towards and across the polar cap, are presented. We highlight the importance accounting contribution of ionospheric <b>irregularities</b> not directly related with particle precipitation in overall <b>irregularities</b> distribution and intensity.|$|R
5|$|On 19 March 1662, Abraham Shipman was {{appointed}} the first Governor and General of the city, and his fleet arrived in Bombay in September–October 1662. On {{being asked to}} hand over Bombay and Salsette to the English, the Portuguese Governor contended that Bombay Island alone had been ceded, and alleging <b>irregularity</b> in the patent, he {{refused to give up}} even Bombay Island. The Portuguese Viceroy declined to interfere and Shipman was prevented from landing in Bombay. He was forced to retire to the island of Anjediva in North Canara and died there in October 1664. In November 1664, Shipman's successor Humphrey Cooke agreed to accept Bombay Island without its dependencies, with the condition of granting special privileges to Portuguese citizens in Bombay, and no interference in the Roman Catholic religion. However, Salsette (including Bandra), Mazagaon, Parel, Worli, Sion, Dharavi, Wadala and Elephanta island still remained under Portuguese possession, as much as Thane or Vasai. From 1665 to 1666, Cooke managed to acquire Mahim, Sion, Dharavi, and Wadala for the English.|$|E
5|$|The {{families}} of those executed continued to seek the overturning of the sentences and compensation, based on the <b>irregularity</b> of the processes used to convict their relatives. In 2004, they appealed to the Constitutional Court of Spain, which rejected their application {{on the grounds that}} it did not have the power to deal with cases prior to December 1978, when the Constitution came into effect. In September 2005, the European Court of Human Rights rejected their petition on similar grounds: that Spain had not been a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights in 1975. In November 2012, a Basque Government commission found that the processes used to convict Txiki and Otaegui had violated their right to a fair trial and awarded €135,000 in compensation to their families. Flor Baena, the sister of José Humberto Baena, continued to campaign for her brother, stating that she wanted to clear his name, not financial compensation.|$|E

40|$|The ionospheric {{absorption}} {{of a radio}} wave caused by small-scale <b>irregularities</b> with a gaussian autocorrelation function is calculated for various values of the linear scale height, the radio frequency, the scale size of the <b>irregularities,</b> and the mean-square fractional electron density fluctuations. The absorption is due to scattering of the radio wave into plasma oscillations by the <b>irregularities.</b> It is concluded that the absorption due to such <b>irregularities</b> with a mean-square fractional electron density deviation greater than about 0. 000001 exceeds the normal collisional height-integrated absorption.

5|$|Women develop {{long-term}} {{complications of}} alcohol dependence {{more rapidly than}} do men. Additionally, women have a higher mortality rate from alcoholism than men. Examples of long-term complications include brain, heart, and liver damage and {{an increased risk of}} breast cancer. Additionally, heavy drinking over time has been found to {{have a negative effect on}} reproductive functioning in women. This results in reproductive dysfunction such as anovulation, decreased ovarian mass, problems or <b>irregularity</b> of the menstrual cycle, and early menopause. Alcoholic ketoacidosis can occur in individuals who chronically abuse alcohol and have a recent history of binge drinking. The amount of alcohol that can be biologically processed and its effects differ between sexes. Equal dosages of alcohol consumed by men and women generally result in women having higher blood alcohol concentrations (BACs), since women generally have a higher percentage of body fat and therefore a lower volume of distribution for alcohol than men, and because the stomachs of men tend to metabolize alcohol more quickly.|$|E
5|$|The Hawaii hotspot is a {{volcanic}} hotspot {{located near the}} namesake Hawaiian Islands, in the northern Pacific Ocean. One of the most well-known and heavily studied hotspots in the world, the Hawaii plume {{is responsible for the}} creation of the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain, a chain of volcanoes over 5,800 kilometres (3,600mi) long. Four of these volcanoes are active, two are dormant, and more than 123 are extinct, many having since been ground beneath the waves by erosion as seamounts and atolls. The chain extends from south of the island of Hawaii {{to the edge of the}} Aleutian Trench, near the eastern edge of Russia. While most volcanoes are created by geological activity at tectonic plate boundaries, the Hawaii hotspot is located far from plate boundaries. The classic hotspot theory, first proposed in 1963 by John Tuzo Wilson, proposes that a single, fixed mantle plume builds volcanoes that then, cut off from their source by the movement of the Pacific Plate, become increasingly inactive and eventually erode below sea level over millions of years. According to this theory, the nearly 60° bend where the Emperor and Hawaiian segments of the chain meet was caused by a sudden shift in the movement of the Pacific Plate. In 2003, fresh investigations of this <b>irregularity</b> led to the proposal of a mobile hotspot theory, suggesting that hotspots are mobile, not fixed, and that the 47-million-year-old bend was caused by a shift in the hotspot's motion rather than the plate's.|$|E
