25|$|In Operation Hickory, the 2nd Battalion, 26th Marines and 2nd Battalion, 9th Marines {{advanced}} {{north from}} Con Thien {{on the morning}} of 18 May to press any NVA against a blocking force from the 3rd Battalion, 4th Marines on the Ben Hai River. At 10:00, 2/26 Marines made contact with 2 NVA Battalions in bunkers and trenches. The 2/9 Marines joined 2/26 and fought a running battle until nightfall. 5 Marines were KIA and 142 were wounded, while 31 NVA were killed. That night 75 radar-controlled airstrikes were called in on the bunker complex. At 07:00 on 19 May after 2 hours of artillery preparation (in which short rounds killed 3 Marines), the 2/26 proceeded to attack the bunker complex, overrunning it by 10:30 killing 34 NVA. At 13:30 2/9 Marines met heavy automatic weapons and mortar fire and an M-48 moved up to silence the NVA positions with canister fire. 2 M-48s were later knocked out by RPG-7 fire and 2/9 Marines suffered 7 KIA and 12 wounded. On 20 May, 3rd Battalion, 9th Marines covering the left flank of the operation encountered an NVA bunker complex and in fighting lasting into 21 May suffered 26 KIA and 59 wounded for 36 NVA dead. On 25 May, Company H, 2/26 Marines engaged a large NVA Company at the base of Hill 117 5km west of Con Thien. Company H joined by Company K, 3/4 Marines made repeated advances up the hill against the NVA with heavy fighting lasting throughout the day and cost 14 Marines and corpsmen KIA and 92 wounded for 41 NVA killed. Marine air and artillery pounded {{the top of the hill}} throughout the night and a new assault was planned for the morning of 26 May, but NVA fire brought down a UH-1E injuring the command element and the assault was postponed until 27 May when Companies E and F of 2/26 Marines and 3/4 Marines secured the hilltop with no resistance. For the remainder of Operation Hickory the Marines encountered only scattered resistance but discovered and destroyed numerous bunkers, ordnance and rice. Operation Hickory concluded on 28 May, the Marines had suffered 142 KIA and 896 wounded for 362 NVA killed. Lam Son 54, Hickory, Belt Tight and Beau Charger also resulted in the removal of the entire civilian population from the area with the result that it was all now a free <b>fire</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} {{effectively}} improve the flexural strength and fracture toughness of ceramics, two methods {{can be used}} to control the growth rate of grain during sintering of ceramic materials by adding a certain amount of (W,Ti)C material. Therefore, on the one hand, the paper simulates the composite ceramic materials based on cellular automata (CA) to optimize the ratio of two formulations. On the other hand, in order to optimize sintering process, CA modeling is also carried out for the sintering process of composite ceramics. Finally, in order to detect the temperature of the <b>firing</b> <b>zone</b> of the ceramic kiln by using the characteristics of the flame image of the <b>firing</b> <b>zone,</b> the K-means clustering method is used for the color segmentation of the flame image of the <b>firing</b> <b>zone</b> of the ceramic kiln. The experimental results show that the size of the grains is in accordance with the actual situation of the simulation and the microstructure evolution of the composites can be simulated well by using the CA theory to simulate the composites; with the increase of simulation time, the grain size distribution is basically unchanged, which accords with the normal distribution, and the simulation process of grain growth is very stable. Based on the K-mean clustering segmentation method, the segmentation of the flame image of ceramic kiln <b>firing</b> <b>zone</b> is realized. This method also provides a good technical means for feature extraction of flame image in ceramic kiln <b>firing</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|R

The fate of empires does not hang on the result. Yet the narrative may not be without interest, or material for reflection. In the quarrels of civilised nations, great armies, many thousands strong, collide. Brigades and battalions are hurried forward, and come perhaps within some <b>fire</b> <b>zone,</b> swept by concentrated batteries, or massed musketry. Hundreds or thousands fall killed and wounded. The survivors struggle on blindly, dazed and dumfoundered, to the nearest cover. Fresh troops are continuously poured on from behind. At length {{one side or the other}} gives way. In all this tumult, this wholesale slaughter, the individual and his feelings are utterly lost. Only the army has a tale to tell. With events on such a scale, the hopes and fears, the strength and weakness, of man are alike indistinguishable. Amid the din and dust little but destruction can be discerned. But on the frontier, in the clear light of morning, when the mountain side is dotted with smoke puffs, and every ridge sparkles with bright sword blades, the spectator may observe and accurately appreciate all grades of human courage--the wild fanaticism of the Ghazi, the composed fatalism of the Sikh, the stubbornness of the British soldier, and the jaunty daring of his officers. He may remark occasions of devotion and self-sacrifice, of cool cynicism and stern resolve. He may participate in moments of wild enthusiasm, or of savage anger and dismay. The skill of the general, the quality of the troops, the eternal principles of the art of war, will be as clearly displayed as on historic fields. Only the scale of the statistics is reduced.|$|E
60|$|Putting {{aside the}} {{question}} of responsibility, {{what happened on the}} morning of Sunday, February 18th, was that from every quarter an assault was urged across the level plains, to the north and to the south, upon the lines of desperate and invisible men who lay in the dongas and behind the banks of the river. Everywhere there was a terrible monotony about the experiences of the various regiments which learned once again the grim lessons of Colenso and Modder River. We surely did not need to prove once more what had already been so amply proved, that bravery can be of no avail against concealed riflemen well entrenched, and that the more hardy is the attack the heavier must be the repulse. Over the long circle of our attack Knox's brigade, Stephenson's brigade, the Highland brigade, Smith-Dorrien's brigade all fared alike. In each case there was the advance until they were within the thousand-yard <b>fire</b> <b>zone,</b> then the resistless sleet of bullets which compelled them to get down and to keep down. Had they even then recognised that they were attempting the impossible, no great harm might have been done, but with generous emulation the men of the various regiments made little rushes, company by company, towards the river bed, and found themselves ever exposed to a more withering fire. On the northern bank Smith-Dorrien's brigade, and especially the Canadian regiment, distinguished themselves by the magnificent tenacity with which they persevered in their attack. The Cornwalls of the same brigade swept up almost to the river bank in a charge which was the admiration of all who saw it. If the miners of Johannesburg had given the impression that the Cornishman is not a fighter, the record of the county regiment in the war has for ever exploded the calumny. Men who were not fighters could have found no place in Smith-Dorrien's brigade or in the charge of Paardeberg.|$|E

40|$|Coal fire burning {{around the}} world is an {{environmental}} catastrophe characterized by the emission of noxious gases, particulate matter, and condensation by-products. In this study, coal fire temperature is retrieved based on Landsat 5 TM images and Generalized Single-Channel Algorithm (GSCA), in Wuda coalfield, Inner Mongolia, China. Then coal <b>fire</b> <b>zones</b> are extracted by Jenks' natural breaks and threshold methods based on temperature images. Changes of coal <b>fire</b> <b>zones</b> are analyzed from 1989 to 2008. The results are summarized as follows: 1) The coal fire temperature retrieval method based on Landsat 5 TM and the GSCA model is effective and feasible, because the temperature error is relatively small (from - 2. 9 A degrees C to + 2. 6 A degrees C) between the measured temperature and the retrieved temperature. 2) The accuracy is relatively high to extract coal <b>fire</b> <b>zones</b> through the Jenks' natural breaks and threshold methods, because 83. 56 % of surveyed area is located in the coal <b>fire</b> <b>zones</b> extracted in 2005. 3) The coal fire area increased 9. 81 x 10 (5) m(2) from 1989 to 2005, and the annual growth is about 6. 1 x 10 (4) m(2), with an annual increasing rate of 2. 48 %.

40|$|Two {{methods are}} {{presented}} which serve {{to incorporate the}} fire-related risk into the current practices in nuclear power plants {{with respect to the}} assessment of configurations. The development of these methods is restricted to the compulsory use of fire probabilistic safety assessment (PSA) models. The first method is a fire protection systems and key safety functions unavailability matrix which is developed to identify structures, systems, and components significant for fire-related risk. The second method is a <b>fire</b> <b>zones</b> and key safety functions (KSFs) fire risk matrix which is useful to identify <b>fire</b> <b>zones</b> which are candidates for risk management actions. Specific selection and quantification methodologies have been developed to obtain the matrices. The Monte Carlo method has been used to assess the uncertainty of the unavailability matrix. The analysis shows that the uncertainty is sufficiently bounded.
