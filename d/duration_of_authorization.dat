(a) <b>Duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>authorization</b> or reauthorization. To {{serve as a}} WIC {{authorized}} store, a store shall be authorized in accordance with subsection (b) or reauthorized in accordance with subsection (c). A store’s authorization or reauthorization shall remain in effect until the Department acts on the store’s application for reauthorization when the next periodic review is conducted in the trade {{area in which the}} store is located, unless terminated earlier in accordance with subsection (d). At least once every 3 years, the Department will conduct a periodic review in each trade area. Failure to submit an application for reauthorization as prescribed under subsection (c) shall result in expiration of the store’s authorization or reauthorization. The Department will provide 30 days written notice to the store prior to expiration of authorization or reauthorization for any store failing to submit an application.

We apply our model to Hydro-Quebec's proposal to build a 1, 250 megawatts interconnection with Ontario. We find that the optimal starts of the regulatory review and of the project construction depend on the randomness of project benefits and on the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the regulatory <b>authorization.</b> A sensible limit on the latter allows the regulator to address changing circumstances at little cost to the firm.

40|$|The {{conventional}} models <b>of</b> <b>authorization</b> {{have been}} designed for database systems supporting the hierarchical, network, and relational models of data.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{discretionary access control}} model in which authorizations contain temporal intervals <b>of</b> validity. An <b>authorization</b> is automatically revoked when the associated temporal interval expires. The proposed model provides rules for the automatic derivation <b>of</b> new <b>authorizations</b> from those explicitly specified. Both positive and negative authorizations are supported. A formal definition of those concepts {{is presented in the}} paper, together with the semantic interpretation <b>of</b> <b>authorizations</b> and derivation rules as clauses of a general logic program. Issues deriving from the presence <b>of</b> negative <b>authorizations</b> are discussed. We also allow negation in rules: it is possible to derive new authorizations {{on the basis of the}} absence <b>of</b> other <b>authorizations.</b> The presence <b>of</b> this type of rules may lead to the generation of different sets <b>of</b> <b>authorizations,</b> depending on the evaluation order. An approach is presented, based on establishing an ordering among authorizations and deriv [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{authorization}} {{problem is}} to decide whether, according to a security policy, some principal should be allowed access to a resource. In the trust-management system SPKI/SDSI, the security policy is given {{by a set of}} certificates, and proofs <b>of</b> <b>authorization</b> take the form of certificate chains. The certificate-chain-discovery {{problem is to}} discover a proof <b>of</b> <b>authorization</b> for a given request. Although certificate-chain-discovery algorithms for SPKI/SDSI have been investigated by several researchers, previous work did not address how to perform certificatechain discovery in distributed environments. We address the certificate-chain-discovery problem where the certificates are distributed over a number of sites, which then have to cooperate to identify the proof <b>of</b> <b>authorization</b> for a given request. We propose two protocols for this purpose. These protocols can also handle cases where certificates are labeled with weights and where multiple certificate chains must be combined to form a proof <b>of</b> <b>authorization.</b> We have implemented these protocols in a prototype and report preliminary results of our evaluation. 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} extent to which {{security}} regimes are the products <b>of</b> <b>authorization</b> in the thought of Thomas Hobbes and Carl Schmitt. The Hobbesian security regime offers a contingent construction of security in terms <b>of</b> processes <b>of</b> <b>authorization</b> and brings into view questions about the epistemic construction of security within security discourse today. The Schmittian concept of security involves the naturalization of security through the state, meaning that security is understood as condition rather than regime. Rather than look to Carl Schmitt’s concept of security as the paradigm of international security there are clear benefits in returning to the contractual account of security evident in the Hobbesian account <b>of</b> <b>authorization.</b> Thus, security is not the primary value of political community but the means by which political communities realise their internal goods. Schmitt’s security regime is fictive, driven by colourful metaphor and political theology. By returning to classic questions <b>of</b> <b>authorization</b> – how a security regime authorizes itself – international relations theory can examine the legitimation of security beyond an exclusively state-centric model.
