500|$|Native Alabamian Allen Barra sharply criticized Lee and {{the novel}} in The Wall Street Journal calling Atticus a [...] "repository of cracker-barrel epigrams" [...] and the novel {{represents}} a [...] "sugar-coated myth" [...] of Alabama history. Barra writes, [...] "It's {{time to stop}} pretending that To Kill a Mockingbird <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> timeless classic that ranks with the great works of American literature. Its bloodless liberal humanism is sadly dated". Thomas Mallon in The New Yorker criticizes Atticus' stiff and self-righteous demeanor, and calls Scout [...] "a kind of highly constructed doll" [...] whose speech and actions are improbable. Although acknowledging that the novel works, Mallon blasts Lee's [...] "wildly unstable" [...] narrative voice for developing {{a story about a}} content neighborhood until it begins to impart morals in the courtroom drama, following with his observation that [...] "the book has begun to cherish its own goodness" [...] by the time the case is over. Defending the book, Akin Ajayi writes that justice [...] "is often complicated, but must always be founded upon the notion of equality and fairness for all." [...] Ajayi states that the book forces readers to question issues about race, class, and society, but that it was not written to resolve them.|$|E

While Kyle is brushing his teeth, Mr. Hankey comes out of the toilet, spreading feces stains everywhere he goes, prompting Kyle's parents to blame Kyle for the mess. Kyle decides he will bring Mr. Hankey to school to prove he is real, but this only causes more problems as Mr. Hankey disguises himself as an unadorned, dried-out piece of feces when he is around people who do not believe in him, leading Cartman to ask if carrying around boxes with feces in them <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> Jewish tradition. Mr. Hankey leaps at Cartman's face as he sings [...] "Kyle's Mom is a Big Fat Bitch" [...] in D Minor, and Kyle is blamed. He is sent to talk to guidance counselor, Mr. Mackey, but Kyle only gets into further trouble when Mr. Hankey takes a bath in Mr. Mackey's coffee.
