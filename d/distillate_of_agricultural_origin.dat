30|$|In this study, it {{was found}} that when the {{distance}} between the point sources and the wells was within 10  m, nitrate concentrations were above the MAV. In contrast, when the distance was greater (more than 10  m), effect on water quality was much rarer. Richards et al. (1996) also showed that the concentration of nitrate is significantly higher in well close to point source (within 6  m) <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>origin</b> or septic systems from the well, compared to the concentration far from point source (within 60  m). It is obvious that the distance of the point source contributes to the final concentration of nitrate and nitrate variability. Gardner and Vogel (2005) also pointed out that distance and numbers of septic tanks and point sources <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>origin</b> contribute to an increased nitrogen concentration in water even at distances up to 300  m and that the proximity of these types of pollution is a prerequisite for poor water quality due to nitrate.|$|R

40|$|Issues of {{sustainable}} agriculture have much relevance and urgency for the sustainable production of non-eatable products {{that have an}} <b>agricultural</b> <b>origin,</b> such as biofuels. In the chapter the opinion is expressed that joint legal regulations on sustainable use {{of natural resources and}} sustainable farming methods for eatable and non-eatable products <b>of</b> an <b>agricultural</b> <b>origin</b> can be an efficient solution for different industry branches. Joint regulations of this kind are desirable, because natural resources for farming different crops, primarily land and water, environmental laws for their use and socio-economic conditions have much in common. The chapter investigates what issues {{of sustainable}} agriculture are relevant for the production of non-eatable products <b>of</b> an <b>agricultural</b> <b>origin</b> on the example of biofuels. The concept of sustainable agriculture in connection to the sustainable production of biofuels <b>of</b> an <b>agricultural</b> <b>origin</b> is explored and analyzed. The correlation between the desired production volumes and the carrying capacity of the Earth’s biosphere is emphasized.

40|$|In the Garigliano river plain NO 3 and Fluoride {{contents}} {{often and}} widely exceed the drinking-water quality guidelines of 50 and 1, 5 mg/L. The Fluoride content is strictly {{related to the}} piezometric pattern. Close to the Garigliano river, lower nitrate content is related to reducing conditions, testified by low values of SO 4 and high content in Fe and Mn. Afterwards, the isotopic analysis (15 N/ 14 N and 18 O/ 16 O ratios of dissolved nitrate) were {{carried out by the}} CNR-Roma in groundwater of some wells. Starting from this broad hydrogeological knowledge, the following maps to evaluate the “Contamination risk” were drawn up: • the “Pollution Vulnerability Map”, evaluated by the SINTACS parametric system; • The “Agricultural Hazard Map”, rated by the parametric models IPNOA (Danger Index by Nitrates <b>of</b> <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Origin).</b> The good correlation between the “Potential Agricultural Nitrate Contamination Risk Map” and the nitrate content distribution suggests that the source of the groundwater nitrate is chiefly related to intensive cropping or livestock.

40|$|New {{evidence}} for cattle husbandry practices during the earliest {{period of the}} southern Scandinavian Neolithic indicates multiple birth seasons and dairying from its start. Sequential sampling of tooth enamel carbonate carbon and oxygen isotope ratio analyses and strontium isotopic provenancing indicate more than one season of birth in locally reared cattle at the earliest Neolithic Funnel Beaker (EN I TRB, 3950 - 3500 cal. B. C.) site of Almhov in Scania, Sweden. The main purpose for which cattle are manipulated to give birth {{in more than one}} season is to prolong lactation for the production of milk and dairy-based products. As this is a difficult, intensive, and time-consuming strategy, these data demonstrate complex farming practices by early Neolithic farmers. This result offers strong support for immigration-based explanations <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>origins</b> in southern Scandinavia on the grounds that such a specialised skill set cannot represent the piecemeal incorporation <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> techniques into an existing hunter-gatherer-fisher economy...|$|R

40|$|The {{parallel}} {{development of}} archaeology and Quaternary geology in several {{regions of the}} world is reviewed, and common problems in dating and correlating alluvial sequences are discussed. Buried archaeological remains and radiometric dates provide a chronological framework for the sequence of Late Quaternary alluvial deposits in the central Jordan Rift. While previous studies emphasized a simple, two-stage model of Late Quaternary alluvial deposition, regional comparisons of the geomorphological contexts of archaeological sites of different ages indicate complex, multiple depositional and erosional cycles. These cycles were influenced by tectonism, climatic changes, human land use, and natural geomorphic thresholds, sometimes in combination. The stratigraphy and chronology <b>of</b> early <b>agricultural</b> settlements in the valley are summarized, and investigations at a protohistoric agricultural town are described. Major regional shifts in prehistoric and protohistoric patterns of agriculture and settlement are interpreted in terms of the impacts of changes in alluvial regimes. These correlations have implications for models <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>origins,</b> and the stability and resilience of sedentary settlements in dry lands...|$|R

40|$|The Paiute of Owens Valley had {{by early}} {{historic}} time progressed to a substantial extent {{along the path}} toward large-scale food production. They are perhaps the best instance in North America {{of a group that}} developed its own system of vegeculture—a system carried over to include irrigation of a variety of seedbearing plants as well. The Owens Valley Paiute thus offer a better example <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>origins</b> than any presently known archaeological cultures that already had domesticated crop plants. And this remarkable achievement of indigenous agriculture occurred in a group which, as Julian Steward (1970) concluded after nearly fifty years of study, had evolved only "proto-bands. " This was a retraction of his earlier statement that they were grouped in true composite landowning bands (Steward 1938 : 50). Comment on that classification we leave for a future time. Steward (1930 : 153) himself deserves credit for recognizing that the Owens Valley Paiute use of irrigation could contribute knowledge within the broader framework of the "origins of agriculture. " Curiously, during Steward's own time, geographer Carl O. Sauer was carrying out research on the problems <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>origins</b> and dispersals. Sauer believed that vegetative propagation had preceded seed cultivation and set out to develop a theoretical basis for locating the cradle of agriculture (Harlan 1975 : 46). Between Sauer (1952) and Edgar Anderson (1954) a model evolved suggesting that agricultural peoples were sedentary fisherfolk living in wooded lands and bringing aggressive plants back from their riverbanks that found natural places to sprout in the kitchen middens of their homes. Evidence since has shown that some of the presuppositions of Sauer and Anderson were simplistic or incorrect (Harlan 1975 : 45). Nevertheless, it seems odd that Sauer, living in California, failed to note that Steward had called attention to practices that so nearly coincided with his own model for <b>agricultural</b> <b>origins.</b> Nearly fifty years have elapsed since Steward wrote his seminal paper on irrigation in Owens Valley, but as yet no anthropologists have mustered interest in closely studying the problem. It may well be too late to acquire much of the information which still remains unknown about Owens Valley agriculture— such as the dating of its origin and the conditions under which it began. Yet research in this neglected area by archaeologists, linguists, plant scientists, and other scholars could probably tell us as much about <b>agricultural</b> <b>origins</b> as current research on the subject being carried out elsewhere in the world...|$|R
