40|$|Abstract. We {{developed}} {{a method for}} the quantification of skin irritation based on the treatment of skin cultures and the subsequent automatic image analysis of fluorescently stained tissue sections being scanned with a fullslide scanner. In this method, the <b>irritative</b> <b>effect</b> is reflected in a shift of the expression pattern of selected biomarkers inside the epithelium. Using the example of SDS as irritant and HSP 27 as a marker for skin irritation we showed that our method is capable of quantifying the <b>irritative</b> <b>effect</b> of SDS and furthermore delivering spatial and time dependent information. ...|$|E

40|$|Background. Serum {{thiocyanate}} concentrations {{are higher}} in smokers than in nonsmokers. Thiocyanate inhibits iodide uptake and organification of iodine and increases iodide efflux from the thyroid cell in vitro. In iodine-deficient areas {{the incidence of}} goiter among smokers is increased. Smokers have higer prevalence of Graves’ disease. There is an even stronger relationship between smoking, and prevalence and degree of endocrine ophthalmopathy. Possible causes are direct <b>irritative</b> <b>effect</b> of cigarette smoke and stimulation of immune reactions. Smoking ameliorates clinical and metabolic effects of hypothyroidism in patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis. Conclusions. Thyroid should {{be added to the}} growing list of organs negatively influenced by cigarette smoking. In the iodine-deficient areas possible goitrogenic effect of smoking should be considered (Slovenia is a mild iodine-deficient area). Patients with endocrine ophthalmopathy should be encouraged to refrain from smoking. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background: Exposure to {{formaldehyde}} (FA) causes <b>irritative</b> <b>effects</b> and induces nasopharyngeal cancer; the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC, Lyon) classified FA as carcinogenic to humans, Group 1.

In this study, {{our aim was to}} determine whether tobacco dust has any effect on lung functions and volumes. A questionnaire about working conditions was applied to 448 workers, some of which had been exposed to tobacco dust while others had not, and all workers underwent measurements of spirometric flow and volume. Of the study group, 126 workers were exposed to tobacco dust for more than 10 years and 55 were not. All of these 181 workers were also nonsmokers. There were statistically significant differences between exposed and unexposed workers in FEV 1 (p< 0. 05), PEFR (p< 0. 01) and MMEF (p< 0. 01) percentages.

40|$|Hyperoxia {{and slow}} {{breathing}} acutely improve autonomic function in type- 1 diabetes. However, {{their effects on}} arterial function may reveal different mechanisms, perhaps potentially useful. To test the effects of oxygen and slow breathing we measured arterial function (augmentation index, pulse wave velocity), baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) and oxygen saturation (SAT), during spontaneous and slow breathing (6 breaths/min), in normoxia and hyperoxia (5 L/min oxygen) in 91 type- 1 diabetic and 40 age-matched control participants. During normoxic spontaneous breathing diabetic subjects had lower BRS and SAT, and worse arterial function. Hyperoxia and slow breathing increased BRS and SAT. Hyperoxia increased blood pressure and worsened arterial function. Slow breathing improved arterial function and diastolic blood pressure. Combined administration prevented the hyperoxia-induced arterial pressure and function worsening. Control subjects showed a similar pattern, but with lesser or no statistical significance. Oxygen-driven autonomic improvement could depend on transient arterial stiffening and hypertension (well-known <b>irritative</b> <b>effect</b> of free-radicals on endothelium), inducing reflex increase in BRS. Slow breathing-induced improvement in BRS may result from improved SAT, reduced sympathetic activity and improved vascular function, and/or parasympathetic-driven antioxidant effect. Lower oxidative stress could explain blunted effects in controls. Slow breathing could be a simple beneficial intervention in diabetes...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to investigate the toxic, damaging and <b>irritative</b> <b>effects</b> of repeated exposure to Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) on rabbit skin. The animals were exposed to 5 % solution of SDS for 8 weeks through skin brushing. All exposed rabbits manifested dermatitis and they were dull, depressed, emaciated and their body weight was decreased. Blood chemical parameters including alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), gama-glutamyl transferase (GGT), amylase, cholesterol, high density lipoproteins (HDLPs); triglycerides (TGs), creatinine, urea, glucose and potassium (K +) were estimated after 8 weeks of SDS exposure. All blood parameters except ALP and creatinine were significantly increased or decreased as compared to that of the controls. It is concluded that topical application of SDS is capable of damaging the skin with all signs of dermatitis. Further, SDS is capable of being adsorbed and penetrates through the skin barrier and thus reaches the internal organs such as liver to provoke systemic damages. The estimated blood parameters can potentially serve as biomarkers for assessing SDS toxicity. However, further studies are warranted to confirm this hypothesis...|$|R

Conjugates of ibuprofen with carboxylic acid moieties of different acrylic polymers were prepared by dehydration reaction using acetic anhydride. Products were characterized by infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, and scanning electron microscopy followed by preparation of microspheres with different sizes from the conjugate Eudragit® L- 100 -ibuprofen. The drug release was monitored by high-performance liquid chromatography. Ibuprofen was bound to the polymers via an anhydride bond in high reaction yields (75 – 95 %) with drug loading of up to 30 % (w/w). These anhydride derivatives hydrolyzed and release the drug at different periods ranging from 1 to 5  days, depending on the hydrophobicity and the cross-linking of the conjugates.

40|$|Methyl formate (MF) is a {{volatile}} solvent with several industrial applications. The acute airway effects of MF were evaluated in a mouse bioassay, allowing {{the assessment of}} sensory irritation of the upper airways, airflow limitation of the conducting airways and deep lung (pulmonary) irritation. MF was studied at vapour concentrations of 202 – 1, 168  ppm. Sensory irritation was the only effect observed, which developed slowly over the 30 -min exposure period. The potency at steady state was at least 10 -fold higher than expected from a hypothetically similar, but non-reactive compound. Methyl formate may be hydrolysed in vivo to formic acid, a potent sensory irritant, and methanol, a low-potent sensory irritant. Hydrolysis may be catalysed by carboxyesterases, and therefore, {{the role of the}} esterases was studied using the esterase inhibitor tri-ortho-cresyl phosphate (TOCP). TOCP pre-treatment reduced the irritation response of MF, suggesting that carboxyesterase-mediated hydrolysis plays a role in the <b>irritative</b> <b>effect.</b> However, even after administration of TOCP, MF was considerably more irritating than expected from a quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) model. The slope of the concentration–effect relationship for formic acid was lower than that for the MF in the low-dose range, suggesting that different receptor activation mechanisms may occur, which may include an effect of MF itself, in addition to an effect of formic acid and potentially an effect from formaldehyde...|$|E
40|$|Since their {{introduction}} in 1996, tension-free midurethral slings (MUS) {{have been}} pro-ven to have long-term efficacy and safety. They {{are considered the}} gold standard treat-ment of female stress urinary incontinence, especially in cases {{that are associated with}} urethral hypermobility. However, they are not free of complications and, although rare, some of these complications can be challenging for both patients and physicians. Some complications occur intraoperatively, whereas others appear in the early or late post-operative period. There is less controversy in the diagnosis and treatment of complica-tions such as vaginal extrusion or urinary system erosion, whereas de novo voiding prob-lems are at best not completely understood. Voiding dysfunction after MUS placement may vary in a wide range from urinary frequency or urgency to retention and is usually attributed to the obstructive or <b>irritative</b> <b>effect</b> of the sling. However, present urody-namic criteria for the diagnosis of female infravesical obstruction are not satisfactory, and the best management policy for de novo voiding dysfunction remains controversial. In the majority of cases, the diagnosis of obstruction leading to a urethral release sur-gery depends on a combination of several clinical findings. The timing of urethral re-lease surgery varies depending on the preferences of the surgeon, and the outcome of this surgery is not always predictable.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{understand}} whether barrier {{methods of}} contraception (BMC) and/or spermicides {{lower the risk}} of acquiring sexually transmitted disease (STD) and to quantify the protection. DESIGN [...] Review of published experimental studies, in vitro and in vivo evidence on the issue. SUBJECTS [...] We reviewed 22 papers that examined the impermeability of BMC in vitro against STD agents or the effect of spermicides, and 60 papers reporting results of epidemiological studies on the risk of STD in users of BMC. RESULTS [...] There was in vitro evidence that both BMC and spermicides were effective against most sexually transmissible agents. Doubts remain on the effectiveness of BMC and spermicides in normal conditions of use, particularly against human papilloma virus. Natural membrane condoms are not impermeable and pores are seen by electron microscopy. Epidemiological studies show a consistent reduction in the risk for use of condoms against gonococcal (most studies giving relative risk, RR, estimates around 0. 4 to 0. 6) and HIV infection (RRs between 0. 3 and 0. 6 in most studies). Spermicides protect women against gonorrhoea and trichomoniasis; their role against other STDs is less clear and there is some indication of an <b>irritative</b> <b>effect</b> on the vaginal mucosa that is likely to be dose-dependent.

The printers had significantly more eye, airway, and neurological symptoms than the controls; the main complaints being irritation of eyes, nose, throat, and a reduced sense of taste. The neurological symptoms were disorders of vision, vertigo, feeling of intoxication, and headache. Furthermore, abdominal pain and flatulence occurred more often among the printers. The symptoms showed no relation to age or job seniority, but neurological and general symptoms were related to shift work. No difference in lung function was found between the two groups. The printers had a slightly lower threshold of smell than the controls. Although the total load due to organic solvents and dust in the air was far below legal limits, the number of magnitude of symptoms experienced by the printers exceeded what is supposed when norms for workroom exposure are set.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: We studied {{subjective}} health {{symptoms in}} a population accidentally exposed to high styrene concentrations in drinking tap water. The contamination occurred during the reparation of a water tank. METHODS: Residents of 27 apartments in two buildings using the contaminated water were contacted. A questionnaire on subjective symptoms was administered to 84 out of 93 persons living in the apartments {{at the time of}} the accident. Styrene concentration was measured in samples of water collected two days after the accident. The means of exposure associated with appearance of symptoms were examined through case-control analyses. RESULTS: Styrene in water reached concentrations up to 900 microg/L. Symptoms were reported by 46 persons (attack rate 55 %). The most frequent symptoms were irritation of the throat (26 %), nose (19 %), eyes (18 %) and the skin (14 %). General gastrointestinal symptoms were observed with 11 % reporting abdominal pain and 7 % diarrhea. The factors most strongly associated with symptoms were drinking tap water (OR = 7. 8, 95 % CI 1. 3 - 48), exposure to vapors from the basement (OR = 10. 4, 2. 3 - 47) and eating foods prepared with tap water (OR = 8. 6, 1. 9 - 40). All residents in the ground floor reported symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This accidental contamination led to very high styrene concentrations in water and was related to a high prevalence of subjective symptoms of the eyes, respiratory tract and skin.

J Dent Res 57 (1) : 3 - 10 January 1978. Recent research suggests that bacterial irrita-tion is the main cause of pulpal damage under silicate, acrylic, composite resin, and zinc phos-phate cement. 1 - 7 Experiments have also dem-onstrated that even if bacteria have been eliminated in the cavities before the restoration is placed, 24 of 25 cavities filled with corn-posite reveal after 4 weeks, a bacterial layer on cavity walls. 3 ' 7 This points to the conclusion that at the margins of composite restorations bacteria usually invade the contraction gap be-tween the enamel and the resin. Within a few weeks the bacteria increase in number and fill a space, which may vary between 2 and 20 Azm. " What this means to the pulp in unlined cavities has been demonstrated in previous studies. 1 - 7 The diffusion of toxins to the pulp seems to be the cause of pulpal damage under such fillings and not the material per se.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} whether furanones could prevent biofilms from being formed. Our first aim {{was to find a}} new synthesis pathway for (Z) - 5 -bromomethylene- 2 (5 H) -furanone, a furanone also produced in nature by the macro-alga Delisa pulchra, and to investigate its effects on biofilm formation by Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mutans and Staphylococcus epidermidis. We also synthesised 5 - (bromomethylene) furan- 2 (5 H) -ones and 3 -(bromomethylene) isobenzofuran- 1 (3 H) -ones to further investigate their effects on biofilm formation by S. epidermidis. The effect on biofilm formation was assessed either by adding furanone to the growth medium or by allowing biofilm to form on surface-adsorbed furanone. Furanone effectively decreased biofilm formation by both application methods, but with surface-adsorbed furanone being most effective. The furanone concentrations used had no effect on microbial growth, and were also well below the established MICs, indicating that the effect was not a result of an antimicrobial effect. In order to determine whether the inhibitory effect was associated with the ability of furanone to interfere with microbial AI- 2 communication, AI- 2 deficient mutants were included. In contrast to their wild types, the amount of biofilm formed by the communication defective S. anginosus and S. intermedius was not affected when adding furanone to the growth medium. Biofilm formation on surface-adsorbed furanone was unaffected or partially affected for the communication defective S. anginosus and S. intermedius mutants respectively. Adding DPD, the synthetic AI- 2 communication signal, to the growth medium abolished the inhibitory effect of furanone on biofilm formation. Furthermore furanones were found to decrease bioluminescence by the AI- 2 reporter strain. Taken together, these findings support the assumption that furanones interfere with microbial communication, without affecting microbial growth. Finally, we studied possible irritative and genotoxic effects of the furanones. Only after using 1000 times higher concentrations than used in the biofilm assay, did we see an <b>irritative</b> <b>effect.</b> There were no significant alterations of the genotoxic and global gene expression in mice treated with furanone. Interference with microbial communication thus may represent a novel and promising strategy to control biofilm related infections...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{advances}} {{in the development of}} in-vitro-tissue-models such as reconstructed human epidermis (RHE), the number of endpoints in toxicity-testing, which can be addressed with these models, is limited. This is {{due to a lack of}} key cellular components and a restricted live time of the models. In addition, the analysis of the models is still dependent on invasive methods such as histological processing or 3 -(4, 5 -Dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) staining. To overcome these pitfalls, we achieved advanced culture systems and biomaterials which allow long term culture of complex tissue-equivalents. Using these technologies, we have developed the first full thickness skin-model with a perfused vascular network. Furthermore, as an alternative for destructive methods, we have established a non-destructive technology to analyze the integrity of the epidermal barrier based on impedance spectroscopy. RHE typically exhibits characteristic impedance spectra in a frequency ranging between 1 Hz and 100 kHz, which is comparable to the spectra of freshly isolated human epidermal biopsies. From these spectra, we extracted electrical parameters of the RHE such as the capacitance and the ohmic resistance. These parameters change significantly during epidermal differentiation and were used to quantify the effects of mechanical and chemical disruption of the epidermal integrity. Most relevant, impedance spectroscopy shows a sufficient sensitivity to detect a transient decreased ohmic resistance caused by 2 -propanol, which is classified as a non-irritant by MTT assays. This result indicates that impedance spectroscopy can be employed as an additional method to assess mild <b>irritative</b> <b>effects.</b> In our work we could create new technologies for the generation and analysis of tissue-models which is a vital requirement to increase the success of in-vitro-test-methods...|$|R
40|$|Abstract OBJECTIVES: Two {{cross-sectional}} {{studies were}} undertaken on {{workers in a}} beverage processing plant to investigate the association between low H(2) O(2) exposure and symptoms of irritation (2005 study) and to investigate the effect of wearing respiratory protection (2006 study). METHODS: The study comprised 69 workers exposed to H(2) O(2) in sterile chambers and 65 unexposed controls. The exposure was assessed from measurements and work task information from employment records. The severity of work-related symptoms was evaluated using questionnaires. Data were analyzed by the Student's t-test, multiple linear regression and analysis of variance for repeated measures of symptoms. RESULTS: Symptoms of eye, nose and throat irritation were significantly (P < 0. 001) more severe among exposed workers compared to controls. Exposure values were occasionally above American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) threshold limit value-time-weighted average (TLV-TWA) in the sterile chambers. The relationship between the severity of symptoms {{and the number of}} entrances in the chambers was significant (P < 0. 0001) in 2005 but not in 2006, when respirators were used during work in the sterile chamber. No differences were found between exposed who entered a sterile chamber in 2005 but not in 2006 and exposed who entered a sterile chamber both in 2005 and 2006. This suggests that respirators provided an efficient protection and that the <b>irritative</b> <b>effects</b> of exposure to H(2) O(2) in 2005 did not disappear after 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: The source of risk was exposure in the sterile chamber, even though the time of exposure was generally only approximately 30 min. To ensure complete worker protection, {{there is a need for}} a short-term exposure limit for H(2) O(2) in addition to the existing ACGIH TLV-TWA value...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aim: Care must {{be taken}} during root canal therapy to prevent {{contamination}} of filling materials and avoid root canal contamination. Gutta-percha cones are now widely used to fill root canals. However they are not resistant to conventional sterilization processes in moist or dry heat. To keep the aseptic chain, gutta-percha cones require rapid chair side decontamination before use. Considering different methods for rapid decontamination of gutta-percha cones, use of chemical agents is the best. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the effectiveness of three different disinfectant solutions in rapid decontamination of gutta-percha cones in one minute Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 360 gutta-percha cones were placed in bacterial suspensions of Staphylococcus aurous, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis spore for 30 minutes, and then immersed in disinfectant solutions (Micro- 10, Deconex 53 Plus, 5. 25 % sodium hypocholorite) for 1 minute. After that, the cones were aseptically transferred to the test tubes containing sterile saline. This solution was diluted 10 -fold and then cultured on in brain-heart-infusion agar and the number of colonies was estimated after 24 h incubation at 37 ْC. A series of 5 previously sterilized cones was used as negative control to check the sterility of gutta-percha cones directly from the manufacturer's box. Another series of gutta-percha cones were considered as positive control group. Results: No bacterial growth was seen in different test groups and negative control group. Conclusion: Analysis of disinfectant effects of sodium hypochlorite, Micro 10 and Deconex 53 plus showed that all of these solutions have bactericidal and sporocidal effect and are very efficient in surface disinfection of gutta–percha cones in one minute. Because of <b>irritative</b> <b>effects</b> and unpleasant odor of sodium hypochlorite, Deconex 53 plus and Micro 10 can be used for rapid decontamination of gutta-percha cones...|$|R
30|$|The {{implementation}} of these principles to open surgery should {{be carried out}} judiciously. That saline should be abandoned, and a richer solution {{should be used for}} irrigation is obvious. Prevention of desiccation can be achieved by continuous irrigation as done in microsurgery, by covering bowels with moistened inert towels and/or by flooding the operative field with humidified CO 2 [29, 30]. The latter indeed decreased adhesion formation in open cardiac surgery. The instillation of humidified CO 2 deep into the surgical field also decreased oxidative stress since the organs were no longer exposed to the 20 % of O 2 in ambient air. A similar effect was achieved by shielding the organs in microsurgery. The exposure of the surgical field to the temperature of the operating theatre has never been an issue in open surgery. We can be happy today that cooling unexpectedly has a beneficial effect. The administration of dexamethasone after surgery, eventually at the end of surgery, may be beneficial to reduce inflammation and adhesion formation and accelerate recovery, while its use might aggravate an eventual infection. The proven very strong beneficial effect of 5 to 10 % of N 2 O with no explosion risk demands a trial in open surgery. As described for humidified CO 2 in cardiac surgery, [29, 30] the deep instillation of gases heavier than air will fill and flood progressively the operation field. CO 2 seems obvious as a carrier gas since it is heavier than air with minimal <b>irritative</b> <b>effect</b> at atmospheric pressure. N 2 O, which fortunately also is heavier than air, should be used in concentrations of 5 to 10 % of N 2 O. For this reason, we used the same combination for these experiments, the efficacy of which had furthermore already been proven in animal models. It will obviously be necessary to prevent or reduce contamination of the operating theatre with N 2 O. The suggested upper threshold for N 2 O is 25  ppm [31]. We speculate that this can be achieved with aquarium-like drapings extending above the operating field with aspiration at the borders to prevent overflow; the opening of the draping would be a compromise between being sufficiently large to permit surgery but small enough to prevent mixture with the ambient air. Indeed even without aspiration contamination with 2  L/min with 10 % of N 2 O would result in only 15  ppm N 2 O in a normal sized (e.g. 40  m 3) and ventilated (e.g. refresh rate of 20  cycles/h) operating room.|$|E
40|$|Studies on the <b>irritative</b> <b>effects</b> of acetone vapor {{in humans}} and {{experimental}} animals have revealed large {{differences in the}} lowest acetone concentration found to be irritative to the respiratory tract and eyes. This has brought on much confusion {{in the process of}} setting occupational exposure limits for acetone. A literature survey was carried out focusing on the differences in results between studies using subjective (neuro) behavioral methods (questionnaires) and studies using objective measurements to detect odor and irritation thresholds. A critical review of published studies revealed that the odor detection threshold of acetone ranges from about 20 to about 400 ppm. Loss of sensitivity due to adaptation and/or habituation to acetone odor may occur, as was shown in studies comparing workers previously exposed to acetone with previously unexposed subjects. It further appeared that the sensory irritation threshold of acetone lies between 10, 000 and 40, 000 ppm. Thus, the threshold for sensory irritation is much higher than the odor detection limit, a conclusion that is supported by observations in anosmics, showing a ten times higher irritation threshold level than the odor threshold found in normosmics. The two-times higher sensory irritation threshold observed in acetone-exposed workers compared with previously nonexposed controls can apart from adaptation be ascribed to habituation. An evaluation of studies on subjectively reported irritation at acetone concentrations < 1000 ppm shows that perception of odor intensity, information bias, and exposure history (i. e., habituation) are confounding factors in the reporting of irritation thresholds and health symptoms. In conclusion, subjective measures alone are inappropriate for establishing sensory irritation effects and sensory irritation threshold levels of odorants such as acetone. Clearly, the sensory irritation threshold of acetone should be based on objective measurements...|$|R
40|$|There are {{distinct}} {{differences between the}} results obtained from human studies and those from experimental animals. In human beings there was seen no acute and long-term toxicity of ingested chromium in the zero and trivalent form. There are some difficulties {{in the evaluation of}} inhaled dusts-consisting of these compounds, probably due to other contaminating agents that caused pneumoconiosis and reduced lung function at few working places. It was seen no <b>irritative</b> dermal <b>effects.</b> But there may exist a risk from sensitation by trivalent chromium, especially by chromium liberated from corrosions or failures of metal - to metal prostheses. No genotoxicity and also no carcinogenicity was observed in human subjects. Summarizing these facts, it must be stated that till now there is no risk from environmental and occupational contamination by these compounds for men, except for patients with lont-term metal prostheses...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to examine the sensory and <b>irritative</b> <b>effects</b> caused by emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) from pine wood and oriented strand boards (OSB) using a controlled human exposure trial. Methods: 15 volunteers were investigated for effects caused by pine wood and 24 volunteers for effects caused by OSB. Each subject was exposed in a 48 m³ test chamber under various exposure conditions 5 times, each for the period of 2 h. The air exchange rate was 1 /h. The volunteers exercised on a cycle ergometer at 50 W throughout the entire experiment. Temperature, relative humidity, CO 2 and VOC concentrations were measured continuously. Sensory effects and irritation of eyes, nose and throat, lung function (FVC, FEV), exhaled nitrogen oxide (NO) concentration, eve blinking frequency, and smell evaluation were recorded before, during and after exposure. Standardized visual analogue scales (VAS) were used to record the volunteer´s subjective physical state. Psychometric questionnaires were used [Freiburger Persönlichkeitsinventar (FLZ) ] to exclude influence of personality traits on the subjective VAS ratings. Odour perception was studied by the "semantic differential (SD) " questionnaire. Results: No evidence for adverse effects on eye, nose, throat, upper airway irritation or lung function was found after 2 -h exposure to VOC levels of up to 13, 000 µg/m³. In addition eye blinking frequency as a parameter for mucosal irritation was not affected during or after exposure. The only detectable effect caused by exposure to pine wood and OSB emissions was a significant perception of odour. However, using SD, the odour of both pine wood and OSB was rated as being more "pleasant" than "unpleasant". Conclusions: The result of our study showed that exposure to rather high VOC concentrations (9000 - 13000 µg/m³) released from pine wood or OSB does not elicit sensory irritation or pulmonary effects in healthy humans. On the basis of our study, adverse health effects on eyes and airways are not to be expected under ordinary indoor air conditions and given appropriate wood and OSB installation...|$|R
40|$|The uses, {{physical}} properties, {{chemical properties}} and {{health effects of}} exposure to 2 -ethyl- 2 -hydroxymethyl- 1, 3 -propanediol (77996) (trimethylolpropane) were reviewed {{as a basis for}} the development of occupational health standards by NIOSH and the Swedish National Institute of Occupational Health (NIOH). Trimethylolpropane has been used in the production of polyurethanes, polyester resins, alkyd coatings and acrylates. It has been found in photocurable coatings, paints, varnishes and dental sealants. Animal testing revealed low levels of toxicity by oral, inhalation and dermal exposure. The oral median lethal dose (LD 50) in rats was about 14 grams per kilogram. Signs of acute intoxication included depression of the central nervous system and damage to the liver and kidneys. The dermal LD 50 in rabbits was greater than 10 grams/kilogram. Mild <b>irritative</b> dermal <b>effects</b> have been noted in animals, but no convincing evidence of irritation has been found in humans. Epidemiological studies or case reports of workers exposed have not been found. No studies on carcinogenicity were available. Limited in-vitro studies did not show any signs of genotoxicity.

40|$|Occupational {{exposure}} to isocyanate vapors or aerosols {{is associated with}} <b>irritative</b> and toxic <b>effects</b> on the airways {{as well as with}} immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions. Nowadays, isocyanates belong to the most important causes of occupational asthma in western countries. Some of the affected subjects suffer from rhinitis, conjunctivitis, cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions. A rare disorder is isocyanate alveolitis. The first hints of isocyanateinduced respiratory disorders are frequently workplace-related cough and shortness of breath. Sometimes, symptoms of unspecific bronchial hyperreactivity or chronic bronchitis are the only complaints. There is also evidence for genotoxic effects of isocyanates which have not been clarified in detail. To ensure reversibility, the early diagnosis of isocyanate disorders followed by the avoidance of the causative substances is required. On the other hand, continuing exposure of sensitized subjects may lead to persistent or even progressive diseases. It seems timely to evaluate current threshold limit values (TLV), especially for oligo- and polyisocyanates, and to stipulate medical surveillance programs including suitable biological monitoring of isocyanate workers. Preventive measures ought to be improved in many workplaces. Updated protection equipment such as closed machinery with encapsulation, efficient exhaust systems, positive pressure hoods as well as masks significantly reduce the health risks...|$|R
