40|$|A {{fundamentally}} improved {{technology for}} micro structured surface measurement, based on Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) and Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) techniques is introduced. The WDM technique allows phase-to-depth implementation over large measurement ratios (range/resolution) while the GPU technique allows {{the analysis of}} the optical interferograms in real-time. This research attempts to create a new kind of full-field measurement to replace electro-mechanical scanning with white-light interferometry and to form a compact system that is fast, robust and suitable for in situ surface measurement.
