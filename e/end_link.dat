On 23 December the Road Bridge reopened for all traffic except heavy goods vehicles (HGVs). On 4 February, it was announced this had been pushed back to March, due to further problems with the truss <b>end</b> <b>link</b> pins in the southern towers, which required additional remedial work.|$|E
500|$|On {{the first}} day, Richard Hornby, of {{engineering}} consulting firm Arup, {{stated that the}} truss end in question had been inspected 23 times since 2001, and no fault had been found. It was revealed a pin had seized up, which caused the truss end to crack, and was only {{the quality of the}} steel which had stopped its cracking appearing earlier. Hornby also made clear that even if the seized pin had been picked up earlier, it was [...] "virtually impossible" [...] to lubricate the bearing. Several witnesses defended a decision by previous operator Forth Estuary Transport Authority (Feta) not to proceed with a £15 million truss <b>end</b> <b>link</b> replacement project in 2010. This claim was disputed by Barry Colford, former chief engineer and bridgemaster at the Feta. Lesley Hinds, Feta’s former convener, pointed out that the bridge budget had been cut by 58% in 2011, while senior staff at Feta had [...] "deep concerns" [...] about the transfer of bridge management to a private company.|$|E

5000|$|A {{sway bar}} {{is usually a}} torsion spring that resists body roll motions. It is usually {{constructed}} out of a cylindrical steel bar, formed into a [...] "U" [...] shape, that connects to the body at two points, and at {{the left and right}} sides of the suspension. If the left and right wheels move together, the bar rotates about its mounting points. If the wheels move relative to each other, the bar is subjected to torsion and forced to twist. Each end of the bar is connected to an <b>end</b> <b>link</b> through a flexible joint. The sway bar <b>end</b> <b>link</b> connects in turn to a spot near a wheel or axle, transferring forces from a heavily-loaded axle to the opposite side.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMobile ad-hoc {{network is}} an infrastructure-less and {{self-organizing}} network, where nodes communicate through wireless links. Because of its dynamic topology, security becomes a vital issue compared to infrastructure networks. MANETs {{are more vulnerable}} to various types of security attacks due {{to the absence of}} trusted centralized authority. Several routing protocols have been proposed for these networks to establish an end to <b>end</b> <b>link</b> for communication between the nodes. These protocols are prone to attacks by the malicious nodes and there is always a need to detect and prevent the attacks timely before the collapse of network. In this paper the focus lies on current routing attacks, security issues of ad-hoc networks and solutions to mitigate attacks against the routing protocols based on cooperation between nodes in network...|$|E

Alamouti's transmit diversty scheme is a space-time block code with support for two transmit antennas and an arbitrary number of receive antennas. Our implementaiton demonstrates this space-time code in a system with two transmit and just one antenna at the receiver. In addition to implementing the encoding and decoding algorithms described in Alamouti's paper, we have designed and implemented additional subsystems necessary to establish an end-to- <b>end</b> <b>link</b> over real wireless channels. These systems, described in detail below, address the challenges of timing synchronization, carrier offset recovery and channel estimation. When combined with an implementaiton of Alamouti's code, these designs form a complete multiple antenna wireless communications sytem...|$|E
40|$|The ATLAS {{experiment}} at CERN {{is planning}} full deployment {{of a new}} unified optical link technology for connecting detector front end electronics on the timescale of the LHC Run 4 (2025). It is estimated that roughly 8000 GBT (GigaBit Transceiver) links, with transfer rates up to 10. 24 Gbps, will replace existing links used for readout, detector control and distribution of timing and trigger information. A new class of devices {{will be needed to}} interface many GBT links {{to the rest of the}} trigger, data-acquisition and detector control systems. In this paper FELIX (Front <b>End</b> <b>LInk</b> eXchange) is presented, a PC-based device to route data from and to multiple GBT links via a high-performance general purpose network capable of a total throughput up to O(20 Tbps). FELIX implies architectural changes to the ATLAS data acquisition system, such as the use of industry standard COTS components early in the DAQ chain. Additionally the design and implementation of a FELIX demonstration platform is presented and hardware and software aspects will be discussed...|$|E
