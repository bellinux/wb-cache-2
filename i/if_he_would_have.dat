5|$|During the Confederate {{incursion}} {{into the}} North in mid-1863 {{that culminated in}} the Battle of Gettysburg, Confederates twice sent parties to Stevens's Caledonia Forge. Stevens, who had been there supervising operations, was hastened away by his workers against his will. General Jubal Early looted and vandalized the Forge, causing a loss to Stevens of about $80,000. Early said that the North {{had done the same}} to southern figures, and that Stevens was well known for his vindictiveness towards the South. Asked <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> taken the congressman to Libby Prison in Richmond, Early replied that he would have hanged Stevens and divided his bones among the Confederate states.|$|E
5|$|In the 1912 presidential election, Lane {{supported}} Democratic {{candidate and}} New Jersey Governor Woodrow Wilson, though {{he declined to}} make campaign speeches on Wilson's behalf, citing ICC policy that commissioners act in a nonpartisan manner. Wilson was elected on November 5, 1912, and on November 21 the commissioner {{spent much of the}} day with Colonel Edward M. House, the President-elect's advisor, who would {{play a key role in}} selecting Cabinet appointees. The possibility of Lane becoming Secretary of the Interior was discussed, but he indicated he was happy in his present position. After the meeting, Lane had second thoughts, and asked House <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> a free hand as Interior Secretary. House indicated that were he to prove capable in the position, Wilson would not interfere. Colonel House did not immediately recommend Lane for the job, but went on to consider other candidates, such as former San Francisco mayor James D. Phelan and Wilson friend Walter Page.|$|E

25|$|On {{the first}} day of the chase, Ahab smells the whale, climbs the mast, and sights Moby Dick. He claims the doubloon for himself, and orders all boats to lower except for Starbuck's. The whale bites Ahab's boat in two, tosses the captain out of it, and {{scatters}} the crew. On the second day of the chase, Ahab leaves Starbuck in charge of the Pequod. Moby Dick smashes the three boats that seek him into splinters and tangles their lines. Ahab is rescued, but his ivory leg and Fedallah are lost. Starbuck begs Ahab to desist, but Ahab vows to slay the white whale, even <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to dive through the globe itself to get his revenge.|$|E
500|$|Toivonen {{was known}} as a {{competitive}} driver both on loose (gravel, dirt, sand, snow and ice) and tarmac surfaces, and he found it difficult to choose between circuit racing and rallying. After becoming a rally driver, he still competed in some circuit racing events, successfully in two World Sportscar Championship events and also in a few races for Eddie Jordan's British Formula Three Championship team. Jordan called Toivonen's performances [...] "incredible" [...] and compared him to Ayrton Senna. After Toivonen's death, Jordan weighed in on his chances in Formula One: [...] "I don't know <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> become a champion in Formula One. It always takes a lot of luck, and now [...] one can doubt <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been granted that. But he would have won Grands Prix– of that I'm absolutely sure." ...|$|E

500|$|On September 18, Garfield asked A.F. Rockwell, a friend, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> a {{place in}} history. Rockwell assured him he would, and told Garfield he had much work still before him. But his {{response}} was, [...] "No, my work is done." [...] The following day, Garfield, by then also suffering from pneumonia and heart pains, marveled {{that he could not}} pick up a glass despite feeling well, and went to sleep without discomfort. He awoke that evening around 10:15 pm with great pain in his chest. The attendant watching him sent for Bliss, who found him unconscious. Despite efforts to revive him, Garfield never awoke, and died at 10:35 pm that evening. Learning from a reporter of Garfield's death, Arthur took the presidential oath of [...] office administered by New York Supreme Court Justice John R. Brady.|$|E
500|$|During Greenwalt's {{restructuring}} of the pilot, all of the original actors save for the male lead role of Mick St. John were recast in June 2007: Shannon Lucio, Rade Šerbedžija and Amber Valletta were originally cast in the roles of Beth Turner, Josef Kostan and Coraline Duvall respectively before Sophia Myles, Jason Dohring and Shannyn Sossamon replaced them. With an almost entirely different cast, a retooled, full-length pilot for television audiences was re-shot. Joel Silver approached Dohring [...] "out of the blue and said, 'There's a role, and I'm making it younger'". Dohring read two pages of script featuring Josef, and was interested by the character's [...] "dark" [...] and [...] "sharp" [...] personality. Dohring {{had to go through}} the normal audition process and was not sure <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> gotten the role without Silver, who had [...] "pushed it all the way through to the end".|$|E
500|$|After {{spending}} most of the off-season on the trade market with the Rockies, Holliday was again a frequent subject of rumors during the spring. [...] The Athletics failed to {{get off to a}} strong start and it was unlikely the club {{would have been able to}} re-sign him over the course of the season or <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had become a free agent following the season. [...] He also got off a slow start as minor injuries hampered him while playing in Oakland. [...] His first home run of the season came on the last day of April against the Texas Rangers. [...] He batted [...]240 in April, and, from May 11 until the St. Louis Cardinals acquired him, improved to [...]316, [...]420 OBP and [...]489 SLG over 65 games. [...] Reaching base five times in May 17 loss to the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park, he scored his first four-hit game and stolen base of the season.|$|E

500|$|After {{his release}} in 1960, Greenglass {{and his family}} lived in New York City under an assumed name. For some years they lived on 228th Street in Laurelton, Queens, New York. In 1996, Greenglass recanted his sworn {{testimony}} {{in an interview with}} The New York Times reporter Sam Roberts and stated he had lied under oath about the extent of his sister's involvement in the spying plot in order to protect his wife. At the trial, Greenglass had testified that Ethel Rosenberg typed his notes to give to the Russians, though he now intimated that Ruth had done the typing, saying [...] "I frankly think my wife did the typing, but I don't remember." [...] Greenglass explained, [...] "My wife is more important to me than my sister. Or my mother or my father, O.K.? And she was the mother of my children." [...] When Roberts asked Greenglass <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done anything differently, he replied, [...] "Never." [...] The role of Ethel Rosenberg in her husband's espionage ring remains a matter of dispute.|$|E
500|$|Joel Silver {{approached}} Dohring [...] "out of {{the blue}} and said, 'There's a role, and I'm making it younger'". Dohring read two pages of script featuring Josef, and was interested by the character's [...] "dark" [...] and [...] "sharp" [...] personality. Dohring {{had to go through}} the normal audition process and was not sure <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> gotten the role without Silver, who had [...] "pushed it all the way through to the end". Munson explained that the goal of the casting changes was [...] "to lighten the show up a bit". He believed the changes granted the studio's and network's wish to [...] "make it a little younger and hipper". O'Laughlin felt that the whole cast's becoming [...] "a little bit younger" [...] especially effected the character Josef, as the originally chosen actor, Šerbedžija, was twice Jason Dohring's age. The creators and the network were concerned that Josef, whose relationship with Mick was important, would appear as more of a [...] "father figure" [...] rather than as a friend. O'Laughlin supported the recasting of Josef with a younger actor due to the resulting [...] "level of ease in that age difference".|$|E
500|$|Some {{have speculated}} that Clark's {{inexperience}} at giving [...] "soundbite" [...] answers hurt him in the media during his primary campaign. The day after he launched his campaign, for example, he was asked <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> voted for the Iraq War Resolution, which granted President Bush the power to wage the Iraq War, a large issue in the 2004 campaign. Clark said, [...] "At the time, I probably would have voted for it, but I think that's too simple a question," [...] then [...] "I don't know if I would have or not. I've said it both ways because {{when you get into}} this, what happens is you have to put yourself in a position—on balance, I probably would have voted for it." [...] Finally, Clark's press secretary clarified his position as [...] "you said you would have voted for the resolution as leverage for a UN-based solution." [...] After this series of responses, although Clark opposed the war, The New York Times ran a story with the headline [...] "Clark Says He Would Have Voted for War". Clark was repeatedly portrayed as unsure on this critical issue by his opponents throughout the primary season. He was forced to continue to clarify his position and at the second primary debate he said, [...] "I think it's really embarrassing that a group of candidates up here are working on changing the leadership in this country and can't get their own story straight... I would have never voted for war. The war was an unnecessary war, it was an elective war, and it's been a huge strategic mistake for this country." ...|$|E

2500|$|During November–December 1884, Gordon's diary {{showed the}} {{stressful}} {{effects of the}} siege, {{as he was in}} a state of mental exhaustion, a man on the brink of madness.

Even if the relief force had reached him, it is not clear <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> left Khartoum, as Gordon wrote in his diary: [...] "If any emissary or letter comes up here ordering me to come down I WILL NOT OBEY IT, BUT WILL STAY HERE, AND FALL WITH THE TOWN!" ...|$|E
2500|$|A late 1880s {{comment by}} Nietzsche, [...] "In an {{infinite}} period of time, every possible combination would {{at some time}} be attained," [...] has been cited to argue that Nietzsche dropped his plans to try to scientifically prove the theory because he realized that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to eventually repeat life as it is, his presumption of infinite time means [...] "he" [...] {{would also have to}} [...] "repeat" [...] life differently, since every configuration of atoms and events will occur. Instead, according to this interpretation of Nietzsche, he continued to propound the doctrine for its psychological and philosophical import.
