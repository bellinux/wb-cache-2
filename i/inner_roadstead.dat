50|$|In mid-May 1759, Edward Boscawen found Brodrick off Toulon {{and took}} over his command of the British forces, blockading Toulon and Marseille and {{ensuring}} the safety of Gibraltar. Along with continuing the blockade with his 13 ships {{of the line and}} two 50-gun ships, Boscawen placed his 12 cruisers at strategic points and on convoy escort duty. Three months later, the French forces had retired into the <b>inner</b> <b>roadstead,</b> covered by the guns of Toulon's fortress, but still thought that such a large British force could not be solely meant for a blockade and must mean a landing was imminent - aware of this by captured letters, Boscawen encouraged this impression by threatening attacks on various points.|$|E
50|$|Djibouti's {{improved}} natural harbor {{consists of}} a roadstead, outer harbor, and <b>inner</b> harbor. The <b>roadstead</b> is well protected by reefs and {{the configuration of the}} land. A quarter of Ethiopia's imports and half of its exports move through the ports. Car ferries pass the Gulf of Tadjoura from Djibouti City to Tadjoura.|$|R
60|$|To {{windward}} was the long, monotonous bank, too obtusely piled {{to afford}} a screen, over which {{they could hear the}} canine crunching of pebbles by the sea without; on their right stretched the <b>inner</b> bay or <b>roadstead,</b> the distant riding-lights of the ships now dim and glimmering; behind them a faint spark here and there in the lower sky showed where the island rose; before there was nothing definite, and could be nothing, till they reached a precarious wood bridge, a mile further on, Henry the Eighth's Castle being a little further still.|$|R
500|$|Derfflinger was to {{have taken}} part in what would have {{amounted}} to the [...] "death ride" [...] of the High Seas Fleet shortly {{before the end of}} World War I. The bulk of the High Seas Fleet {{was to have}} sortied from its base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet; Scheer—by now the Großadmiral of the fleet—intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy, in order to retain a better bargaining position for Germany, whatever the cost to the fleet. While the fleet was consolidating in Wilhelmshaven, war-weary sailors began deserting en masse. As Derfflinger and Von der Tann passed through the locks that separated Wilhelmshaven's <b>inner</b> harbor and <b>roadstead,</b> some 300 men from both ships climbed over the side and disappeared ashore.|$|R

500|$|Hindenburg was to {{have taken}} part in what would have {{amounted}} to the [...] "death ride" [...] of the High Seas Fleet shortly {{before the end of}} World War I. The bulk of the High Seas Fleet {{was to have}} sortied from their base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet; Admiral Reinhard Scheer intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy, to achieve a better bargaining position for Germany whatever the cost to the fleet. The plan involved two simultaneous attacks by light cruisers and destroyers, one on Flanders and another on shipping in the Thames estuary; Hindenburg and the other four battlecruisers were to support the Thames attack. After both strikes, the fleet was to concentrate off the Dutch coast, where it would meet the Grand Fleet in battle.

500|$|Von der Tann was to {{have taken}} part in a final fleet action {{at the end of}} October 1918, days before the Armistice was to take effect.

However, many of the war-weary sailors felt the operation would disrupt the peace process and prolong the war.

500|$|In October, {{with the}} war largely lost, Scheer and Hipper envisioned one last major fleet advance to attack the British Grand Fleet.
