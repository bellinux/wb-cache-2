40|$|The {{electron}} spin resonances (ESR) of several native and modified melanins have been determined. Melanins isolated from black wool and synthesized from 3, 4 -dihydroxyl-L-phenylalanine (L-DOPA) and tyrosine all show similar ESR signals. Modification of the isolated melanins by treatment with reducing agents causes some lightening {{in color and}} slight changes in the ESR spectra. Lithium and liquid ammonia (Birch) reduction applied to melanins from wool and L-DOPA gave very different results, as reflected by ESR spectra, but {{in both cases the}} changes were much greater than those produced by other treatments. In general, reductive treatments in nonaqueous media in the presence of metals increase the free radical content and line width, whereas treatment in aqueous media resulted in decreased free radical content. These observations are consistent with a melanin pigment which is an <b>irregular</b> <b>polymer</b> and has unpaired electrons localized on different but similar monomer units...|$|E
40|$|The {{ultimate}} {{control on}} film growth represents {{a challenge in}} PECVD: interphase, film structure and surface roughness {{are affected by the}} surface energy, growth and ion fluxes and ion energy. Such control is desired for moisture diffusion barriers, where an <b>irregular</b> <b>polymer</b> surface and defects determine the performance. Routes for microstructure control in PECVD SiO 2 barrier layers are presented. The addition of ion bombardment to a remote plasma with a gradient in growth flux allows tuning the film microstructure during growth with the purpose of engineering an adhesive interphase and a dense SiO 2 barrier. The role of ion bombardment on the film microstructure is here investigated by means of ellipsometric porosimetry, which monitors the refractive index change due to the adsorption (and desorption) of ethanol vapors in the volume of macro-meso-micro pores in the layer. From the analysis of the adsorption isotherm and the presence of hysteresis during the desorption step {{as a function of the}} equilibrium partial pressure, the open porosity can be determined. Recently, we have also explored atomic layer deposition (ALD) for a virtually ultimate control on film microstructure. Plasma can assisted ALD (Plasma- assisted ALD) by providing radicals, replacing one precursor (e. g., O radicals replacing H 2 O in Al 2 O 3 deposition). 20 nmthick plasma- assisted ALD Al 2 O 3 layers are characterized by water vapor transmission rates (WVTRs) as low as 10 - 3 g/m 2 day...|$|E
40|$|Chapter 2 {{investigates the}} {{mechanism}} of the temperature-controlled polymerization of 3 - methyl- 3 -phenylcyclopropene (MPCP) by Mo(NAr) (CHCMe 2 Ph) (Pyr) (OTPP) (Ar = 2, 6 - diisopropylphenyl, Pyr = pyrrolide, OTPP = 2, 3, 5, 6 -tetraphenylphenoxide). Cissyndiotactic poly(MPCP) is obtained at - 78 °C, while atactic poly(MPCP) is obtained at ambient temperature. The syn initiator (syn refers to the isomer in which the substituent on the alkylidene points towards the imido ligand and anti where the substituent points away) reacts with MPCP to form an anti first-insertion product at low temperatures, which continues to propagate to give cis,syndiotactic polymer. At higher temperatures, the anti alkylidenes that form initially upon reaction with MPCP rotate thermally to syn alkylidenes on a similar timescale as polymer propagation, giving rise to an <b>irregular</b> <b>polymer</b> structure. In this system cis,syndiotactic polymer is obtained through propagation of anti alkylidene species. Chapters 3 - 5 detail the synthesis and reactivity of compounds containing a 2, 6 - dimesitylphenylimido (NAr*) ligand {{in order to provide}} {{a better understanding of the}} role of steric hindrance in olefin metathesis catalysts. A new synthetic route to imido alkylidene complexes of Mo and W, which proceeds through mixed-imido compounds containing both NAr* and NtBu ligands, was developed to incorporate the NAr* ligand. Alkylidene formation is accomplished by the addition of 3 equivalents of pyridine*HCl to Mo(NAr*) (NBu) (CH 2 CMe 2 Ph) 2 or the addition of 1 equivalent of pyridine followed by 3 equivalents of HCl solution to W(NAr*) (N'Bu) (CH 2 CMe 2 Ph) 2 to provide M(NAr*) (CHCMe 2 Ph) Cl 2 (py) (py = pyridine). Monoalkoxide monochloride, bispyrrolide, and monoalkoxide monopyrrolide (MAP) compounds are isolated upon substitution of the chloride ligands. Reaction of W MAP complexes (W(NAr*) (CHCMe 2 Ph) (Me 2 Pyr) (OR)) with ethylene allows for the isolation of unsubstituted metallacycle complexes W(N Ar*) (C 3 H 6) (Me 2 Pyr) (OR) (R = CMe(CF 3) 2, 2, 6 -Me 2 C 6 H 3, and SiPh 3). By application of vacuum to solutions of unsubstituted metallacyclebutane species, methylidene complexes W(NAr*) (CH 2) (Me 2 Pyr) (OR) (R = tBu, 2, 6 -Me 2 C 6 H 3, and SiPh 3) are isolated. Addition of one equivalent of 2, 3 - dicarbomethoxynorbornadiene to methylidene species allows for the observation of firstinsertion products by NMR spectroscopy. Investigations of NAr* MAP compounds as catalysts for olefin metathesis reactions show that they are active catalysts, but not E or Z selective for ring-opening metathesis polymerization the homocoupling of 1 -octene or 1, 3 -dienes. Methylidene species W(NAr*) (CH 2) (Me 2 Pyr) (OR) (R = 2, 6 -Me 2 C 6 H 3 or SiPh 3) catalyze the ring-opening metathesis or substituted norbornenes and norbornadienes with ethylene. by Laura Claire Heidkamp Gerber.

Oxidative phenolic coupling reactions, wheremonomersprimarily couple endwisewiththe growing chain, generate the polymer. The combinatorial linkage synthesis, the random generation of new optical centres each time a monolignol couples via its sidechain, and the inclusion of monomers other than the monolignols, cascade to create polymers with enormous variation in primary structure. Lignification is a strategic process that has evolved to allow plants considerable flexibility in dealing with various environmental stresses.

40|$|Solutes {{are often}} most {{efficiently}} deployed in discrete pulses, {{for example in}} the delivery of herbicides or drugs. Manual application of each pulse can be labor-intensive, automated application of each pulse can be capital intensive, and both are often costly and impractical. Barrier-Mediated Pulsatile Release (BMPR) systems offer a materials-based alternative for automated pulsatile drug delivery, without pumps, power supplies, or complex circuitry. While earlier materials-based approaches such as delayed-release microcapsules are limited to two or three pulses due to the independent nature of each pulse’s timing control, BMPR systems link the timing of each pulse to the previous pulse. Each dose of drug is sequestered in its own stimuli-sensitive depot, releasing only upon contact with the stimulant. These depots are stacked with sacrificial barriers in between, each of which block the stimulant for a predetermined time. For instance, layers of soluble drug may be separated by degradable polymer layers. Water, as the stimulant, will erode the polymer layer over a fixed period of time, followed by quick dissolution and release of the underlying drug and the start of degradation for the next polymer layer. This example, however, is quickly limited by <b>irregular</b> <b>polymer</b> erosion, a single stimulant (water), and difficulty in scaling delay times. The research work presented in this thesis reports the development of a generalized BMPR system which overcomes those limitations. Model drugs (methylene blue and methyl orange) were immobilized in a pH-sensitive polymer [poly(methyl methacrylate-co-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) ] which released only at low pH. Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles immobilized in a pH-insensitive matrix [poly(vinyl alcohol) ] served as the barrier layer. The time required for acid to penetrate the barrier layer scaled with the ZnO concentration and with the square of the polymer thickness, allowing wide scaling of the delay time with only minor changes to the barrier layer. Harnessing the swelling pressure of the acid-sensitive hydrogel, each barrier/depot bilayer can delaminate upon solute release, directly exposing the next bilayer to the stimulant source. This system has demonstrated tuned release using a citric acid stimulant to produce up to ten pulses of model drug (methylene blue) over various preset timescales. This system has also demonstrated the alternate release of multiple solutes (methylene blue and methyl orange) at regular time intervals up to five pulses from a single BMPR device. For non-delaminating BMPR systems, spent bilayers impede stimulant diffusion to the inner layers and solute diffusion from the inner layers, increasing the delay time and the pulse width. To predict these changes, a computational model was constructed in FORTRAN. This model was extensively explored over a wide range of parameter space to understand the release behavior of various kinds of non-delaminating BMPR systems. The computer model also validates the performances of experimental delaminating BMPR system. This model can be used to guide the physical modeling of BMPR systems. The model also allows to incorporate variety of stimulants other than just acid. BMPR technology introduces efforts to further generalize the delivery strategy by incorporating glucose as a stimulant...|$|E

The effects arising from substituent, solvent, dilution, and radiation dose allowed to define the conditions suitable for polymerization, which was favored in methanol at increasing dilution of the alkyne.

40|$|Assembly and {{disassembly}} of viral capsids {{are essential}} {{steps in the}} viral life cycle. Studies on their kinetics are mostly performed in vitro, allowing application of biochemical, biophysical and visualizing techniques. In vivo kinetics are poorly understood and the transferability of the in vitro models to the cellular environment remains speculative. We analyzed capsid disassembly of the hepatitis B virus in digitonin-permeabilized cells which support nuclear capsid entry and subsequent genome release. Using gradient centrifugation, size exclusion chromatography and immune fluorescence microscopy of digitonin-permeabilized cells, we showed that capsids open and close reversibly. In the absence of RNA, capsid re-assembly slows down; the capsids remain disintegrated and enter the nucleus as protein dimers or <b>irregular</b> <b>polymers.</b> Upon the presence of cellular RNA, capsids re-assemble in the nucleus. We conclude that reversible genome release from hepatitis B virus capsids is a unique strategy {{different from that of}} other viruses, which employs irreversible capsid destruction for genome release.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Little {{is known}} of the intermolecular {{organization}} of crystallins in the protein-packed eye lens. The tetrameric structure of the 200 000 Da avian δ-crystallin, which {{is closely related to}} the enzyme argininosuccinate lyase and is characteristic of the accommodating, soft lens of birds, has recently been solved at atomic resolution at acidic pH. To help understand how δ-crystallin remains soluble at the very high concentrations found in the avian lens we have now crystallized turkey δ-crystallin at around neutral pH and examined its intermolecular interactions. Results Turkey δ-crystallin has been crystallized around neutral pH. The X-ray structure has been solved at 4. 5 å resolution in space group C 2 with three and a half tetramers in the asymmetric unit. The symmetrical 222 tetramers have a novel packing arrangement consisting of continuous helices, with 732 non-crystallographic symmetry, in an approximately hexagonal close-packed array. The internal 222 symmetry of the tetramers allows different polymeric chains to be constructed, based on the tetramer–tetramer association observed in the crystalline helix. It is possible to build a model of a tubule of diameter 212 å that is very similar to observed tubules of bovine argininosuccinate lyase. Conclusion Elements of helical organization may occur in the concentrated solution of the avian eye lens where δ-crystallin is the prominent protein. The symmetry of the tetramer provides a choice in the direction of growth of a helix at each link so that highly hydrated <b>irregular</b> <b>polymers</b> may be formed rather than large compact regular structures that would not be compatible with a transparent lens...|$|R

The findings have shown that the paramagnetism of this melanin follows the Curie Law from 500 °K to 4. 2 °K, that the spin signal can be eliminated by the addition of Cu++ to the melanin, and that the optical and e. s. r. absorptions of melanin are independent since either can be reduced or eliminated without affecting the other. Similar studies on synthetic melanins produced by autoxidation or by enzymatic oxidation of a number of biphenols were carried out. It was found that the e. s. r. signals of these synthetic melanins were strikingly similar (with respect to line width, line shape, and g-value) with those of squid melanin.

The coagulation of polymer particles progressed rapidly in the initial 2 h with decreasing the zeta potential of the particles. The polymer yield increased almost linearly until 50 % of the monomer was consumed despite the significant decrease in the number of polymer particles. The mechanism of polymerization was speculated on a basis of the nucleation of hydrophilic short chains in the aqueous phase and the slow termination in a polymer particle with the desorption of radicals. The reaction temperature was raised from 333 to 353 K prior to the end of polymerization (1 - 5 h).

The ligand exchange approach is easy to perform, but the resulting water-soluble quantum dot NCs are only stable for a short period, and its quantum yield (QY) decreases significantly [4] because the original hydrophobic surface ligands are replaced by hydrophilic ligands such as thioglycolic acid (TGA). Another method is to coat a hydrophilic shell such as a silica capping [12] {{on the surface of}} semiconductor NCs. This method also results in low quantum yield.

While gas chromatography (GC) {{was used to determine}} the monomer yields from both thioacidolysis and DFRC, 31 P NMR studies quantified the various phenolic hydroxy groups released by DFRC. The monomer yields from thioacidolysis and DFRC were substantially different, with thioacidolysis resulting in higher yields. In contrast, an excellent agreement was obtained in the total number of -aryl ether structures determined by thioacidolysis and DFRC/ 31 P NMR, indicating that the combination of DFRC with quantitative 31 P NMR overcomes, at least in part, the limitations presented by the DFRC method. Both thioacidolysis and DFRC/ 31 P NMR were further used to better understand the lignin isolation process from wood. The results show that mild rotary ball milling minimizes, but does not prevent, the degradation of -O- 4 structures during the early stages of wood pulverization. The extent of such degradation was found to be higher for E. globulus than for a variety of softwoods examined.
