In 1955 a rail link was built to Litang in Guangxi province, where it joined the Hunan-Guangxi Railway. Since then, Zhanjiang has developed into a major modern port serving southern China, usable by ships of up to 50,000 tons. In 1984 Zhanjiang was designated one of the [...] "open" [...] cities of China, where the central government invited foreign investment; this spurred the city's further industrial development.

50|$|The Bhutto {{government}} {{carried out}} a number of reforms in the industrial sector. His reforms were twofold: nationalisation, and the improvement of workers' rights. In the first phase, basic industries like steel, chemical and cement were nationalised. This was done in 1972. The next major step in nationalisation took place on 1 January 1974, when Bhutto nationalised all banks. The last step in the series was the nationalisation of all <b>flour,</b> <b>rice</b> <b>and</b> cotton <b>mills</b> throughout the country. This nationalisation process was not as successful as Bhutto expected. Most of the nationalised units were small businesses that could not be described as industrial units, hence making no sense for the step that was taken. Consequently, a considerable number of small businessmen and traders were ruined, displaced or rendered unemployed. In the concluding analysis, nationalisation caused colossal loss not only to the national treasury but also to the people of Pakistan.|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{technical}} efficiency of wheat <b>and</b> paddy <b>rice</b> processing in China. Understanding the level of technical efficiency of food processing helps to decide whether efforts are warranted to improve this efficiency. Studies on China's technical efficiency of <b>flour</b> <b>and</b> <b>rice</b> processing are scarce. This paper fills this gap. Design/methodology/approach – With a unique set of firm-level survey data collected by China's State Statistical Bureau, this study adopts a stochastic frontier model to investigate the technical efficiency of <b>flour</b> <b>and</b> <b>rice</b> processing. Findings – The technical efficiency for both <b>flour</b> <b>and</b> <b>rice</b> processing is low in China, being only about 50 per cent. On average, rice processing firms have slightly higher technical efficiency than flour processing firms. It is also found that a significant proportion of firms experienced negative growth of technical efficiency during the time period of investigation. Originality/value – Each year, some 300 million tonnes of wheat <b>and</b> paddy <b>rice</b> are processed in China. Any small improvement in technical efficiency is translated into huge economic gains. Further, a tiny improvement in flour or rice output rate is equivalent to an enormous increase in food supply, contributing to China's food security. The paper confirms the need and potential to raise technical efficiency in China for wheat <b>and</b> paddy <b>rice</b> processing.

40|$|AbstractThe {{impact of}} {{addition}} of gelatinized rice porridge to bread {{has been investigated}} on loaf volume, viscoelastic properties and air-bubble structure. We prepared four variety of bread: bread containing rice porridge (rice porridge bread), bread containing gelatinized rice flour (gelatinized <b>rice</b> <b>flour</b> bread), <b>and</b> wheat <b>flour</b> <b>and</b> <b>rice</b> <b>flour</b> breads for references. Instrumental analyses the bread samples were carried out by volume measurement of loaf samples, creep test and digital image analysis of crumb samples. Rice porridge bread showed the maximum specific volume of 4. 51 cm 3 /g, <b>and</b> even gelatinized <b>rice</b> <b>flour</b> bread showed 4. 30 cm 3 /g, which was larger than the reference bread samples (wheat <b>and</b> <b>rice</b> <b>flour</b> breads). The values of viscoelastic moduli of gelatinized <b>rice</b> <b>flour</b> bread <b>and</b> <b>rice</b> porridge bread were significantly smaller (p < 0. 05) than those of wheat <b>flour</b> <b>and</b> <b>rice</b> <b>flour</b> breads, which indicates addition of gelatinized rice flour or rice porridge to bread dough encouraged breads softer. Bubble parameters such as mean air- bubble area, number of air-bubble, air-bubble area ratio (ratio of bubble area to whole area) {{were not significantly different}} among the bread crumb samples. Therefore, the bubble structures of the bread samples seemed to similar, which implied that difference of viscoelasticity was attributed to air-bubble wall (solid phase of bread crumb) rather than air-bubble. This study showed that addition of gelatinized rice to bread dough makes the bread with larger loaf volume and soft texture without additional agents such as gluten...|$|R
