50|$|This {{metaphor is}} used to {{describe}} the planning that many people have to do to conserve and ration their energy reserves to accomplish their activities of daily living. The planning and rationing of energy-consuming tasks has been described as being a major concern of those with chronic and fatigue-related diseases, illness, or conditions. The theory explains the difference between those who don't seem to have <b>energy</b> <b>limits</b> and those that do. The theory {{is used to}} facilitate discussions between those with limited energy reserves and those that do not. Because healthy people typically are not concerned with the energy expended during ordinary tasks such as bathing and getting dressed, the theory helps healthy people realize the amount of energy expended by chronically ill or disabled people to get through the day.|$|E
50|$|The {{shoreline}} in the North and West of {{the lake}} remains substantially unaltered since deglaciation. Beaches have formed on the lake where rivers bring sediment to areas where the near shore relief is not too steep allowing pocket beaches to form. The beaches around the lake show many similarities to ocean shores. The shape {{of the lake}} funnels wind and waves down the long axis which leads to longshore transport or littoral drift of sediment and size selective sorting. There are however a number of differences to ocean shores. The short fetch length produces a narrow range of wave conditions and this low <b>energy</b> <b>limits</b> the size of sediment in transport. Large changes to the beach profile are induced by fluctuations in lake level, major fluctuations can drown beaches. The beaches on the lake develop a distinctive shelf profile whereby beach sediments grade lakeward into fine sand. The {{outer edge of the}} shelf is marked by a shelf break and a transition to organic-rich muds on a steep offshore slope. There are a number of different types of beaches including pavement beaches, gravel, mixed sand and gravel beaches and sand beaches.|$|E

We analyse the pre-big bang cosmological {{scenario}} which appears nat-urally in this context due {{to the existence of}} scale factor duality symmetry in string theory. We then discuss some of the attractive and problematic features of this scenario. Finally, we introduce a method which is powerful enough to search for cosmological solutions in various low <b>energy</b> <b>limits</b> of string theories...|$|E

Rigorous results are derived algebraically for the time evolution of selected macroscopic observables, e. g., the global magnetization. The high and low <b>energy</b> <b>limits</b> are investigated and the analytical predictions are compared with direct $N$-body simulations.

We justify why scalar QCD represents a good approximation to the full QCD approach for the energy loss of heavy quarks. In the regime of accessible phenomenology we observe that the emission at small transverse momentum (dead cone effect) is less suppressed than originally suggested. We also investigate {{the influence of a}} finite gluon mass on the discussed results...|$|R
