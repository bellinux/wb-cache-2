The Wimsey stories were popular, and successful enough for Sayers to leave the advertising agency where she was working.|$|E

25|$|The high {{specific}} heat capacity of water and the insulating effect of soil and rock can mitigate the effects of climate and maintain groundwater at a relatively steady temperature.

For example, during hot weather relatively cool groundwater can be pumped through radiators in a <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> returned to the ground in another well. During cold seasons, because it is relatively warm, the water can be used {{in the same way as}} a source of heat for heat pumps that is much more efficient than using air.|$|E
