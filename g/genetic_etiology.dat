2500|$|BRA {{appears to}} have a {{predominantly}} <b>genetic</b> <b>etiology</b> and many cases represent the most severe manifestation of an autosomal dominant condition with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. There are several genetic pathways that could result in this condition. In 2017 researchers identified heritable autosomal dominant mutations in the gene GREB1L in two unrelated families as being the cause of both BRA and URA utilizing Exome Sequencing and direct sequence analysis. [...] This is the first reported genetic lesion implicated in the activation of Retinoic Acid Receptor (RAR) Targets that has been associated with renal agenesis in humans. The majority of other possible candidate genetic pathways are autosomal recessive in nature and do not coincide with the frequency or penetrance at which BRA typically occurs in the human population. Additionally, candidate genetic pathways would be expected to involve genes expressed in the developing urogenital system (UGS).

This method of grouping leads to patient evaluations based on a shared <b>genetic</b> <b>etiology</b> for the observed phenotypes, regardless of their suspected diagnosis.

50|$|Other vertebrates, such as fishes, amphibians, {{reptiles}} and birds, {{produce a}} variety of non-melanin pigments. Disruption of melanin production {{does not affect the}} production of these pigments. Non-melanin pigments in other vertebrates are produced by cells called chromatophores. Within this categorization, xanthophores are cells that contain primarily yellowish pteridines, while erythrophores contain primarily orangish carotenoids. Some species also possess iridophores or leucophores, which do not contain true pigments, but light-reflective structures that give iridescence. An extremely uncommon type of chromatophore, the cyanophore, produces a very vivid blue pigment. Amelanism in fishes, amphibians, reptiles and birds has the same <b>genetic</b> <b>etiology</b> as in mammals: loss of tyrosinase function.

40|$|Several {{methods for}} {{investigating}} genetic heterogeneity for extreme levels of a quantitative trait with hypothesized multiple <b>genetic</b> <b>etiologies</b> require a priori stratification of families and/or identification of distinct phenotypes among affected individuals. We present a statistical approach for detecting genetic heterogeneity {{that does not}} rely on either a priori stratification or discrete disease phenotypes. Complex segregation analysis was applied to total serum cholesterol measurements in 709 relatives of 98 healthy index cases selected from 3, 666 school children surveyed for lipid levels in Rochester, Minnesota. Thirty-three of the index cases and 109 relatives had hypercholesterolemia (cholesterol levels greater than the 95 th percentile for their age and sex). Through application of the mixed genetic model and then estimation of conditional probabilities for having the mutant allele at the major locus, genetic heterogeneity for hypercholesterolemia was indicated. In three of 70 pedigrees {{with one or more}} hypercholesterolemics, there is strong evidence for segregation at a major locus. In the remaining pedigrees, only polygene variation and/or environmental variation are associated with cholesterol variability. Grandparents in the three pedigrees that were segregating at the major locus had the highest rates of death due to coronary heart disease. This study establishes that the mixed model has the potential to identify pedigrees with different <b>genetic</b> <b>etiologies</b> for variability in quantitative traits...|$|R

50|$|Further {{evidence}} for a non-genetic etiology of diseases like schizophrenia, Ewald also points, comes from concordance studies on identical twins, which measure the percentage of identical twins who both develop a disease. A concordance of 100% indicates a primarily genetic disease, which is not really influenced by environmental factors like infection, nutrition, or toxins. Huntington's disease, for example, has a concordance rate of 100%, indicating a predominately <b>genetic</b> <b>etiology.</b> However, when the concordance rate is lower, this indicates environmental factors like infectious microbes or toxin exposure are playing a causal role. Schizophrenia's concordance is approximately 35-60%, suggesting, says Ewald, that microbes are etiologically involved. Another example is breast cancer: Ewald notes {{that in the case}} of identical twins, when one twin develops breast cancer, the other twin has only a 10% to 20% chance of developing the disease, and this concordance rate of just 20% again indicates that environmental factors like infectious microbes or toxins are likely playing large causal roles in breast cancer.|$|E

50|$|Historically, {{due to the}} {{behavioural}} stimulation manifested as {{a symptom}} in several the neurogenomic disorders, the therapies would rely mostly on anti-psychotics or antidepressents. These classes of medications would suppress common symptoms of the disorders, but with questionable efficacy. The biggest barrier to neruopharmacogenomic research was the cohort sizes. Given newly available large-cohort sequencing data, {{there has been a}} recent push to expand therapeutic options. The heterogenous nature of neurological diseases is the key motivation for personalized medicine approaches to their therapies. It is rare to find single high penetrance causative genes in neurological diseases. The genomic profiles understandably vary between cases, and logically, the therapies would need to vary between cases. Further complicating the issue is that many of these disorders are spectrum disorders. Their <b>genetic</b> <b>etiology</b> will vary within this spectrum. For example, severe ASD is associated with high penetrance de novo mutations. Milder forms of ASD is usually associated with a mixture of common variants.|$|E

This study utilizes polygenic risk scores to examine the potential genetic overlap {{of traditional}} and e-cigarette behaviors. Each score reflects the combined effect of selected risk alleles for smoking. Method A polygenic risk score analysis was calculated using the Genes for Good (n= 258) sample and regression weight from UK Biobank (n= 19, 357). Scores were generated at six p-value thresholds, with 5 e- 8 being the most stringent. Scores were then correlated to cigarettes per day (CPD) and frequency of e-cigarette use.
