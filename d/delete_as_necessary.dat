Its {{instructions}} say how to blend its ingredients - chunks of frame-text within itself - with the ingredients from other frames. The “chef” is a frame processor that carries out the instructions, i.e. the frame commands, which alter (add, modify, <b>delete)</b> ingredients <b>as</b> <b>necessary,</b> to suit the main recipe.|$|R
5000|$|Wear {{leveling}} {{can also}} defeat data erasure, by relocating blocks {{between the time}} when they are originally written and {{the time when they}} are overwritten. For this reason, some security protocols tailored to operating systems or other software featuring automatic wear leveling recommend conducting a free-space wipe of a given drive and then copying many small, easily identifiable [...] "junk" [...] files or files containing other nonsensitive data to fill as much of that drive as possible, leaving only the amount of free space necessary for satisfactory operation of system hardware and software. As storage and/or system demands grow, the [...] "junk data" [...] files can be <b>deleted</b> <b>as</b> <b>necessary</b> to free up space; even if the deletion of [...] "junk data" [...] files is not secure, their initial nonsensitivity reduces to near zero the consequences of recovery of data remanent from them.|$|R
40|$|A new {{algorithm}} for {{the generation}} of anisotropic, unstructured triangular meshes in two dimensions is described. Inputs to the algorithm are the boundary geometry and a metric that specifies the desired element size and shape {{as a function of}} position. The algorithm is an example of what we call pliant mesh generation. It first constructs the constrained Delaunay triangulation of the domain, then iteratively smooths, refines, and retriangulates. On each iteration, a node is selected at random, it is repositioned according to attraction/repulsion with its neighbors, the neighborhood is retriangulated, and nodes are inserted or <b>deleted</b> <b>as</b> <b>necessary.</b> All operations are done relative to the metric tensor. This simple method generates high quality meshes whose elements conform well to the requested shape metric. The method appears particularly well suited to surface meshing and viscous flow simulations, where stretched triangles are desirable, and to time-dependent remeshing problems. K [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Modern Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are {{distributed}} real-time systems that detect unauthorized use or attacks upon an organization’s network and/or hosts. The components of most distributed IDSs {{are arranged in}} a hierarchical tree structure, where the sensor nodes pass information to the analyzer nodes. Optimal placement of the analyzer nodes results in an improved response time for the IDS, and isolation of attacks within the IDS network. Since the network topology and workload are constantly changing, {{we are able to}} maintain near-optimal placement of the analyzer nodes by instantiating them as mobile agents. The analyzer nodes may then relocate, reproduce or be <b>deleted</b> <b>as</b> <b>necessary.</b> Such flexibility improves the response times and the stability of an IDS. The movement of the analyzer nodes also offers some protection against denial-ofservice attacks, since secure analyzer nodes will be relocated to take over some of the functionality of the host under attack. KEY WORDS: intrusion detection systems; mobile agents; scalability. 1...|$|R
40|$|Drought {{has been}} a {{prevalent}} feature of the American landscape during {{the latter part of}} the 1980 s, producing serious socioeconomic and environmental consequences. These recent experiences with drought have renewed concern about the inadequacy of federal and state contingency planning efforts and the lack of coordination for assessment and response efforts between these levels of government. This paper presents the results of research aimed at facilitating the preparation of drought contingency plans by state government in conjunction with a state’s overall water management planning activity. The ten-step drought plan development process reported is intended to improve mitigation efforts through more timely, effective, and efficient assessment and response activities. Officials in appropriate state agencies should examine the proposed framework and alter it to best address drought-related concerns, adding or <b>deleting</b> elements <b>as</b> <b>necessary...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Tertiary Oil Recovery Information System, or TORIS, was {{developed}} by the Department of Energy in the early 1980 s with a goal of accounting for 70 % of the nation`s original oil in place (OOIP). More than 3, 700 oil reservoirs were included in TORIS, but coverage in the Appalachian basin was poor. This TORIS enhancement project has two main objectives: to increase the coverage of oil fields in the Appalachian basin; and to evaluate data for reservoirs currently in TORIS, and to add, change or <b>delete</b> data <b>as</b> <b>necessary.</b> Both of these objectives have been accomplished. The geological surveys in Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia have identified 113 fields in the Appalachian basin to be included in TORIS that collectively contained 80 % of the original oil in place in the basin. Furthermore, data in TORIS {{at the outset of the}} project was checked and additional data were added to the original 20 TORIS oil fields. This final report is organized into four main sections: reservoir selection; evaluation of data already in TORIS; industry assistance; and data base creation and validation. Throughout the report the terms pool and reservoir may be used in reference to a single zone of oil accumulation and production within a field. Thus, a field is composed of one or more pools at various stratigraphic levels. These pools or reservoirs also are referred to as pay sands that may be individually named sandstones within a formation or group...|$|R
40|$|MODULAR SIMULATION ENVIRONMENTS: AN OBJECT MANAGER BASED ARCHITECTURE To {{perform a}} {{simulation}} project, simulationists employ simulation specific software tools, {{general purpose software}} tools, and perhaps software developed {{to meet the needs}} of a particular project. Ideally, these divergent tools would work together in a seamless simulation environment. Modular simulation environments are one way of meeting this goal. Software tools can be added to or deleted from a modular simulation as needed. Thus, the simulation environment can be configured on a project by project basis or even dynamically during the course of a project. The flow of data between the tools in the environment is also a primary concern. An object manager based architecture provides the capabilities to add and <b>delete</b> software tools <b>as</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>as</b> well as to control the flow of data between the software tools. Each software tool and each data set can be viewed as an object with certain attributes. The object manager controls the invocation of the software tools as well as meeting input data requirements and organizing and managing the results of each operation. The design of such an object manager is presented. An example modular simulation environment is given and its configuration and operation illustrated. ...|$|R
