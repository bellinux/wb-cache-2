40|$|The {{intestines}} {{of freshly}} caught Saccobranchus fossilis (a freshwater fish that contains <b>dehydroretinol)</b> became free from carotenoids and from vitamin A {{when the fish}} were starved for about 20 days. When beta-carotene was administered to such fish, retinoic acid could be isolated from the intestines after approx. 4 h. When lutein was administered to such fish, <b>dehydroretinol</b> and 3 -hydroxyretinol could be isolated from the intestines after approx. 5 h...|$|E
40|$|The uptake and {{metabolism}} of radiolabelled retinol was {{studied in}} cultivated human skin cells. Normal epidermal keratinocytes in primary culture {{were able to}} incorporate unbound [11, 12 - 3 H]all-trans-retinol from the growth medium and transform it into 3, 4 -didehydroretinol (<b>dehydroretinol)</b> in a dose- and time-dependent manner. A total of 23 % of the radioactive label became cell-associated during a 48 -h incubation period when added at 7 nM to differentiated keratinocytes submerged in serum-containing, high-calcium (1. 56 mM) culture medium. At that time point, 25 - 30 % of cell-bound radioactive retinol had been converted into <b>dehydroretinol,</b> with no labelled retinal, dehydroretinal, retinoic acid or dehydroretinoic acid being detected in cells or medium. Thus <b>dehydroretinol,</b> which occurs physiologically in mammalian skin tissue in vivo, was identified as the predominant neutral retinol metabolite in cultured keratinocytes using h. p. l. c. and anhydro-derivatization procedures. At least 94 % of the product, along with its precursor, was present in the cells in esterified form, with no traces of the compound being secreted into the cell environment. The rate of formation of <b>dehydroretinol</b> from its precursor was significantly lower in keratinocytes grown in serum-free, low-calcium (0. 09 mM) culture medium, and in medium pre-incubated with excess unlabelled substrate. Furthermore, the application of 13 -cis-retinoic acid (isotretinoin), a therapeutic retinoid drug known to markedly reduce <b>dehydroretinol</b> levels in human skin, blocked the biosynthesis of this metabolite in cultured keratinocytes. The 3, 4 -dehydrogenation pathway observed in this study could not be shown to operate to any significant extent in cultures of human epidermal melanocytes or dermal fibroblasts, supporting the hypothesis that keratinocytes represent the principal cell type involved in <b>dehydroretinol</b> formation from retinol in human skin...|$|E
40|$|Pro-vitamin A (β-carotene) and the {{predominant}} forms of vitamin A in human skin (retinol and <b>dehydroretinol)</b> were analyzed in hydrolyzed specimens from 4 cadavers and 22 healthy subjects. β-carotene was identified in extracts of epidermis by its specific absorption spectrum. Vitamin A {{was determined by}} high-pressure liquid chromatography. The concentrations {{were related to the}} wet weight or protein content of the sample. The analysis of different skin compartments showed that the concentrations of the 3 constituents were usually related as follows: carotene > retinol > <b>dehydroretinol.</b> The concentrations were always higher in the epidermis than in the upper dermis. Skin surface lipids contained carotene and retinol but not in amounts sufficient to contribute to the higher epidermal values. Analysis of epidermal autopsies from 5 different skin areas (back, breast, arm, leg and foot) and of epidermal biopsies {{from the back of the}} healthy subjects showed that the interindividual differences were larger for carotene and <b>dehydroretinol</b> than for retinol, whereas the intraindividual variations were larger for retinol. The mean (± SD) concentrations of carotene, retinol and <b>dehydroretinol</b> in back skin epidermis of healthy subjects were 13 ± 5, 1. 7 ± 0. 4 and 0. 4 ± 0. 2 μg/g protein, respectively. No significant variations with age and sex were found...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The vitamin A statuses of {{two groups}} of In-donesian women were {{compared}} by using the modified-relative-dose-response (MRDR) test: 1) lactating, nonpregnant women of lower socioeconomic status (n = 64) and 2) better-educated, pre-menopausal, nonpregnant, nonlactating women (n = 14). At times from 3 to 6 h after dosing, the mean ratio of <b>dehydroretinol</b> to retinol (DR/R) in the serum was approximately threefold higher in the lactating women than in the control group, eg, 0. 109 ± 0. 073 and 0. 034 ± 0. 015, respectively, at 5 h. At a provisional DR/R cutoff of 0. 06, the vitamin A statuses of 70 % of the lac-tating women and of 7 % of the control women were judged to be inadequate. Only 7 % of the variability in abnormal MRDR ratios {{could be attributed to}} body weight. Both abnormal and normal responses were highly reproducible when performed 0. 5 - 3. 25 mo after the first test.

40|$|The {{disposition}} of oral isotretinoin {{to the skin}} {{and the effects of}} the drug on the vitamin A levels in serum and skin were studied in 17 patients with nodulocystic acne. All patients received 0. 5 mg/kg/day for 3 months and 8 patients continued treatment with 0. 75 mg/kg/day for another 3 months. The parent drug, the major metabolite (4 -oxo-isotretinoin), and 2 natural retinoids (retinol and <b>dehydroretinol)</b> were monitored in serum and biopsies of uninvolved skin, using adsorption high-pressure liquid chromatography. During the initial 3 months of treatment the mean isotretinoin level in the serum was 145 ng/ml and in the epidermis 73 ng/g. The corresponding values for 4 -oxo-isotretinoin were 615 and 113 ng/g, respectively. Even at the highest dosage there was no progressive accumulation of isotretinoin in serum, epidermis, or subcutis. After discontinuation of therapy the drug disappeared from both serum and skin within 2 – 4 weeks. The serum transport of vitamin A, monitored by the concentrations of retinol, retinol-binding protein, and prealbumin (transthyretin), was not affected by the treatment. By contrast, the retinol level in the epidermis increased by an average of 53 % (p < 0. 01) and the <b>dehydroretinol</b> level decreased by 79 % (p < 0. 001) as a result of 3 months of treatment. Both changes were reversible. The results suggest that isotretinoin therapy interferes with the endogenous vitamin A metabolism in the skin...|$|E
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{identify}} vitamin A and derivatives (retinoids) specimens of breast skin epidermis (0. 5 g) were homogenized, freeze-dried and extracted with chloroform/methanol. The evaporated extract was partitioned repeatedly between petroleum ether and a mixture of ethanol and pH-adjusted water. This yielded 3 fractions of partially purified retinoids. High-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) of these fractions revealed {{the presence of the}} following retinoids given in order of their abundance in the epidermis: retinyl acyl esters, retinol, 3 -dehydroretinyl acyl esters and retinoic acid. Small amounts of other retinoids may also be present. In order to obtain quantitative data it was essential to add internal retinoid standards and to completely hydrolyze the skin in KOH-ethanol before extraction. The retinoids were deconjugated by this procedure but, with the exception of retinaldehyde, were otherwise unchanged. The recoveries of the endogenous retinoids at HPLC were identical to those of the internal standards. The technique was reproducible and could be applied to the analysis of nanograms of retinol and <b>dehydroretinol</b> in small (10 – 30 mg) skin specimens. The amounts of acidic retinoids were usually below the detection limit of the method (< 10 ng/g) but the approach may be useful at the higher levels attained during retinoid therapy...|$|E
