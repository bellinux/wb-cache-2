25|$|Despite {{the health}} {{services}} that exist, {{there are serious}} problems and deficiencies. As of 1997, life expectancy in the state was 71.5 years, 9 years higher than in 1990. The death rate has decreased from 5.79 deaths per thousand to 5.14. While much of Mexico's health care system struggles to meet needs, the system in Oaxaca, one of the country's poorest states, has it particularly bad. The relatively prosperous state of Nuevo Le√≥n has 3,207 hospital beds, while Oaxaca has only 1,760, {{despite the fact that}} the two states have about the same population. There is about the same ratio of doctors between the two states. Forty four percent of pregnant women receive pre-natal care <b>from</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> not medically qualified. 70 women each year die from complications from pregnancy and childbirth, and most of these are avoidable, due to bleeding and eclampsia. For every 100,000 live births in Oaxaca, there are 95.1 maternal deaths, over the national average of 63.3, putting the state in the top five.|$|E

2500|$|The {{extensive}} use of stereotypes is another controversial aspect of the show, though the intent is actually {{to make fun of}} bigotry. As Jess Harnell states in the DVD commentary for [...] "Hot Tub", [...] "Most of the racism on the show is coming <b>from</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> so obviously stupid about it; it really isn't that threatening". (Jewish people are mocked, including creators and principal cast member Tara Strong.) Other content known to be featured on some episodes are occurrences of natural disasters, depictions of authoritarian dictators and sexual fetishes.|$|E

I played with Benny Goodman for two years, and I've been {{composing}} for 40. At the time, swing music, big-band music and Benny Goodman in particular were so boundlessly popular that people who made room for it in their lives have never forgotten it. So I get calls <b>from</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> in a kind of time warp, who ask me about this period of my life as though it were the present. But I've moved on to other things." ...|$|E

[...] Dubbed a [...] "cardiologist's worst nightmare", this burger is [...] [...] Aside from bringing in revenue from sales, it has drawn more fans {{to come out to}} the ballpark: apparently, attendance at games has increased and the burger {{is one of the most}} popular aspects of the park. [...] The burger has met with criticism from burger purists and <b>from</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> turned off by the thought of the taste and the health implications.|$|E
2500|$|By September 13, CBS's {{position}} {{had shifted}} slightly, as Rather acknowledged [...] "some {{of these questions}} come <b>from</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> not active political partisans," [...] and stated that CBS [...] "talked to handwriting and document analysts and other experts who strongly insist the documents could have been created in the '70s," [...] (emphasis added). The analysts and experts cited by Rather {{did not include the}} original four consulted by CBS. Rather instead presented the views of Bill Glennon and Richard Katz. Glennon, a former typewriter repairman with no specific credentials in typesetting beyond that job, was found by CBS after posting several defenses of the memos on blogs including Daily Kos and Kevin Drum's blog hosted at Washington Monthly. However, in the actual broadcast, neither interviewee asserted that the memos were genuine.|$|E

25|$|Much {{has been}} written about the siege, {{gathered}} <b>from</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> there, <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> not, and taken from historical Marine documents. Con Thien was the battle before Tet, a battle commanders at the time dismissed, and later forgotten maybe a little embarrassed because it showed how unprepared the US was for the 1968 Tet offensive.|$|R

They're a hospitable people, and, in a general way, when you are in need of a kindness, you're most likely to get it <b>from</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> as hard up as you are." [...] He paused with a {{whimsical}} smile. [...] "One can't logically feel hurt at the other kind for standing aside or shutting their eyes, but when they proceed to point out that if you had only emulated their virtues you would be equally prosperous, it becomes exasperating, especially as it isn't true. So far as my observation goes, it isn't the practice of the stricter virtues that leads to riches." ...|$|E

There isn't any undernote, none of that ceaseless, awful monotony of sound that seems like the falling of weary men's feet upon the eternal pavement. Listen--there is a bird singing somewhere in that tree, and the water goes lapping and lapping and lapping, {{as though it had}} {{something}} pleasant to say but were too lazy to say it. And every now and then, if you listen very intently, you can hear laughing voices through the trees there from the river, laughter <b>from</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> happy, who are sailing on somewhere to find their city of pleasure. And the perfumes, Arnold! I don't know what the rose garden is like, but even from here I can smell it. It is wonderful." ...|$|E
