40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a final {{documentation of}} the project whose goal is demonstrating manufacturability of soft lithography. Specifically, our target is creating micron scale patterns of resists on a 3 square inch, relatively large area in case of soft lithography, flexible substrate using microcontact printing in order to forming <b>electronic</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>patterns</b> for flexible displays. At first, the general principles and characteristics of soft lithography are reviewed {{in order to provide}} the snapshot of soft lithography technologies, and the key factors that affect the productivity and quality of microcontact printing are discussed because such factors should be understood in advanced to develop current lab-based microcontact printing science into plant manufacturing technology. We proposed a prototype for automated of microcontact printing process adopting a continuous reel-to-reel design, ideal for mass production, as well as printing-side-up design in order to minimize the distortion of relief features of PDMS stamp. The machine we created not only demonstrated the manufacturability of microcontact printing, our initial project goal, but also high scalability for mass production. The machine can print micron scale patterns on a 7 square inch plastic sheet, four times bigger than initial target area, at once. by Hyung-Jun Kim. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|Recent network {{research}} {{has sought to}} characterize complex systems {{with a number of}} statistical metrics, such as power law exponent (if any), clustering coefficient, community behavior, and degree correlation. A larger goal of such research is to obtain insight into the systems’ functions by means of these and similar analyses. In this paper we examine network models of mechanical assemblies. Such systems are well understood functionally. We show that they have both rich and varied community structure as well as negative degree correlations (disassortative mixing), and show that this can be explained by additional powerful constraints that arise from identifiable first principles. In addition, we note that their main “motif” is closed loops (as it is for electric and <b>electronic</b> <b>circuits),</b> a <b>pattern</b> that conventional network analysis does not detect but which is used by software designed to aid in the design of such systems. The implication is that functional understanding of complex systems requires considerable domain knowledge beyond what typical network analysis tools employ...|$|R
40|$|In many applications, a {{suitable}} permutation of <b>patterns</b> (<b>electronic</b> <b>circuit</b> nodes, cutting <b>patterns,</b> product orders etc.) {{has to be}} found in order to optimize over some given objective function, so giving rise to the so-called Open Stack Problems.

In the literature, the connection costs and the circuit area are also know as Time of Open Stacks and Maximum Number of Open Stacks, respectively. We propose a genetic algorithm providing heuristic solutions, and a branch-and-cut algorithm, based on a new linear integer programming formulation and representing, at our best knowledge, the first exact approach in the literature.

40|$|We {{present a}} BTI compact model that {{is able to}} account for the complex BTI stress {{patterns}} encountered in complex <b>electronic</b> <b>circuits.</b> Such stress <b>patterns</b> are composed of various blocks corresponding to different circuit operation states, protocol modes or input conditions, and the blocks repeat within a composite, hierarchical structure. The present work extends a previously introduced physics-based accurate NBTI modeling while preserving its numerical efficiency. We provide insight into some principal characteristics of BTI degradation under hierarchical stress patterns, such as a non-trivial dependence on multiple duty cycles. In particular, the NBTI degradation can sensitively depend on the temporal sequence of NBTI stress blocks, and building a model on just the average stress or on stress histograms can be misleading. An SRAM cell example demonstrates this method and compares the cell's BTI failure statistics for two different hierarchic-periods stress patterns...|$|R

40|$|Fuzzy <b>electronic</b> <b>circuit</b> (FEC) is firstly introduced, {{which is}} {{implementing}} Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy chaotic systems on <b>electronic</b> <b>circuit.</b> In the research field of secure communications, the original source should be blended with other complex signals. Chaotic signals {{are one of}} the good sources to be applied to encrypt high confidential signals, because of its high complexity, sensitiveness of initial conditions, and unpredictability. Consequently, generating chaotic signals on <b>electronic</b> <b>circuit</b> to produce real electrical signals applied to secure communications is an exceedingly important issue. However, nonlinear systems are always composed of many complex equations and are hard to realize on <b>electronic</b> <b>circuits.</b> Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model is a powerful tool, which is described by fuzzy IF-THEN rules to express the local dynamics of each fuzzy rule by a linear system model. Accordingly, in this paper, we produce the chaotic signals via <b>electronic</b> <b>circuits</b> through T-S fuzzy model and the numerical simulation results provided by MATLAB are also proposed for comparison. T-S fuzzy chaotic Lorenz and Chen-Lee systems are used for examples and are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed <b>electronic</b> <b>circuit...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper mainly {{discusses}} the energy-saving design method for large weak <b>electronic</b> <b>circuit.</b> In large scale <b>electronic</b> <b>circuit,</b> {{there is no}} direct relevance between every two element modules. The traditional weak element circuit design concentrates in a single module, while ignoring module dependencies in energy-saving design, resulting in high energy consumption in large-scale <b>electronic</b> <b>circuits.</b> This paper proposes to establish the relevance energy-loss model for each model in the large-scale weak <b>electronic</b> <b>circuit</b> to obtain the energy consumption situation, and consider the energy consumption in module coordination to saving energy. The simulation results show that the proposed model used for large-scale energy weak circuit design can effectively reduce the energy consumption in weak circuit application. ...|$|R

40|$|Modern power {{semiconductor}} switching devices are currently {{used in a}} wide variety of industrial and domestic applications. With the development in high {{power semiconductor}}s, large scale power switching circuits will be used increasingly in a variety of electric utility applications. To ensure reliable operation of power <b>electronic</b> <b>circuits,</b> it is necessary to consider the switching characteristics of power semiconductor devices, the switching control and transients of widely different time scales. This invariably makes the analysis and design process very complicated. The availability of powerful digital computers now make it possible to simulate the power <b>electronic</b> <b>circuits</b> operation prior to their fabrication.
