25|$|By now {{the murders}} had {{attracted}} widespread media attention and many students were taking extra precautions, such as changing their daily routines and sleeping together in groups. Because the spree was happening {{so early in}} the fall semester, some students withdrew their enrollment or transferred to other schools. Twenty-three year old Tracy Paules was living with Manny Taboada, also 23, her burly 200lb roommate. On Monday, August 27, Rolling broke into the apartment by prying open the sliding glass <b>door</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> same tools he had used previously. Rolling found Taboada asleep in one of the bedrooms and, after a struggle with the young man, eventually killed him.|$|E
25|$|Colonial governments {{accepted}} {{a degree of}} responsibility for pauper patients who were not convicts. However, as convict numbers declined and the emancipated and free population grew, the government disengaged itself from direct responsibility for the 'respectable poor'. Meanwhile, the Sydney Dispensary had been created in 1826 to provide outpatient care for 'free poor persons, unable to pay for medical attendance'. It was conducted on traditional charitable lines and operated from several city premises before obtaining the south wing of the Rum Hospital in 1845 where it remained until 1848. This change in use of the South Wing required more repairs to {{the internal and external}} building fabric from 1843. At the same time, the Sydney Dispensary expanded to serve inpatients and changed its name to the Sydney Infirmary and Dispensary, a title officially approved in 1844. Convict inpatients continued to be treated in the separately managed hospital in the centre wing, next <b>door.</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> dissolution of the convict hospital system, the Sydney Infirmary and Dispensary gave up the south wing in 1848 in return for permissive occupancy of the entire middle section of the Rum Hospital complex.|$|E

Junpei returns to Akane, finding her nearly dead. Zero says over the loudspeakers that the game's loser has been determined; Junpei acts defiant, but Zero clarifies that he is referring to himself.

500|$|Graunt {{recorded}} the incompetence of the Searchers at identifying true causes of death, remarking on the frequent recording of 'consumption' rather than other diseases which were recognised then by physicians. He suggested {{a cup of}} ale and a doubling of their fee to two groats rather than one was sufficient for Searchers to change {{the cause of death}} to one [...] more convenient for the householders. No one wished to be known as having had a death by plague in their household, and Parish Clerks, too, connived in covering up cases of plague in their official returns. Analysis of the Bills of Mortality during the months plague took hold shows a rise in deaths other than by plague well above the average death rate, which has been attributed to misrepresentation of the true cause of death. As plague spread, a system of quarantine was introduced, whereby any house where someone had died from plague would be locked up and no one allowed to enter or leave for 40 days. This frequently led to the deaths of the other inhabitants, by neglect if not from plague, and provided ample incentive not to report the disease. The official returns record 68,596 cases of plague, but a reasonable estimate suggests this figure is 30,000 short of the true total. A plague house was marked with a red cross on the <b>door</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> words [...] "Lord have mercy upon us", and a watchman stood guard outside.|$|E
500|$|Butterfly {{garnered}} {{critical acclaim}} from music critics. Nathan Brackett, {{senior editor of}} Rolling Stone and author of The Rolling Stone Album Guide, praised the album's producers and Carey's [...] "more controlled" [...] vocals. Brackett noticed a connection between much of Carey's lyrics and her separation from Mottola. Jon Pareles, editor of The New York Times called Butterfly [...] "a new turn" [...] in Carey's career. He wrote, [...] "Carey has sold {{tens of millions of}} albums by being the girl next <b>door</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> startling vocal range... but for most of [...] "Butterfly" [...] Carey turned her voice into an airy whisper, as if she would rather charm listeners" [...] compared to over-powering them. Aside from commenting on its deviance from Carey's previous work, he noted songs in which Carey alludes to her failed marriage to Mottola, such as [...] "Butterfly" [...] and [...] "Close My Eyes" [...] which were both released on the album following the divorce with lyrics about letting love go and life struggles. Additionally he wrote, [...] "Since Carey writes her own lyrics, fans might expect a glimpse of marital discord or pride in her new-found autonomy." [...] David Browne from Entertainment Weekly gave Butterfly a B- in his review. Browne wrote: [...] "In Breakdown, [...] demonstrates she can match the staccato, lite-reggae phrasing of her guests, two members of Bone Thugs-N-Harmony." [...] He described an increased intimacy in the music but noted the arrangement made it difficult to hear the lyrics Carey was singing. [...] "Butterfly is undeniably pleasant, with little of the all-conquering bombast usually associated with Carey. But it's also the last thing anyone would have expected from her: blandly self-effacing." ...|$|E
