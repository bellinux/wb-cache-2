5|$|Sebaceous glands {{are found}} in hair-covered areas, where they are {{connected}} to hair follicles. One or more glands may surround each hair follicle, and the glands themselves are surrounded by arrector pili muscles. The glands have an acinar structure (like a many-lobed berry), in which multiple glands branch off a central duct. Relative to keratinocytes {{that make up the}} hair follicle, sebaceous glands are composed of huge cells with many large vesicles that contain the sebum. These cells express Na+ and Cl− ion channels, ENaC and CFTR (see <b>Fig.</b> <b>6</b> and Fig. 7 in reference).|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the 19th and 20th centuries, the Birmingham and Black Country urban areas were {{coalescing}} into a single extensive conurbation spanning the borders of three counties: Warwickshire, Staffordshire and Worcestershire. Other similar urban areas in England, such as Lancashire, Tyneside, London and within Yorkshire West Riding, had grown in size since the Industrial Revolution. The expansion of these conurbations saw economic and physical integration with neighbouring towns and communities. This process became more prominent due to growing housing issues, extensive bombing during World War II, slum clearance, and continuing migration into urban areas. The Black Country contained a combination of county boroughs, urban districts, municipal boroughs and county councils (See <b>Fig</b> <b>6)</b> taking responsibility for services, which resulted in a fragmented local government infrastructure. The Local Government Act 1958 appointed a Local Government Commission to review administrative structures and boundaries in England outside London. The Act designated a West Midlands Special Review Area, whose recommendations would ultimately form the West Midlands Order 1965 legislation. A second report known as the West Midlands General Review looked into the administrative authorities within the wider region, including the remainder of Worcestershire.|$|E
5|$|The south transept's {{southern}} wall {{is nearly}} complete, displaying the fine workmanship {{of the first}} phase. It shows the Gothic pointed arch style in the windows that first appeared in France in the mid-12th century and was apparent in England around 1170, but hardly appeared in Scotland until the early 13th century. It also shows the round early Norman window design that continued {{to be used in}} Scotland during the entire Gothic period (<b>Fig.</b> <b>6).</b> The windows and the quoins are of finely cut ashlar sandstone. A doorway in the south-west portion of the wall has large mouldings and has a pointed oval window placed above it. Adjacent to the doorway are two lancet-arched windows that are topped at the clerestory level with three round-headed windows. The north transept has much less of its structure preserved, but much of what does remain, taken together with a study by John Slezer in 1693, shows that it was similar to the south transept, except that the north transept had no external door and featured a stone turret containing a staircase.|$|E

Double arrows indicate neuronal mappings. Neural mappings connect neural maps, which are not far apart from each other (see above). The two mirrored locations of the phonetic map are connected via a neural pathway (see above), leading to a (simple) one-to-one mirroring of the current activation pattern for both realizations of the phonetic map. This neural pathway between the two locations of the phonetic map {{is assumed to be}} a part of the fasciculus arcuatus (AF, see Fig. 5 and <b>Fig.</b> <b>6).</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{lines of}} foliage treatment, so {{common in the}} bands of the 15th-century roodscreens and the panel work {{especially}} of Germany, serve to illustrate the widely different motives of the craftsmen of these two great epochs. Again, while the Renaissance designer as a rule made {{the two sides of}} the panel alike, the Gothic carver seldom repeated a single detail. While his main lines and grouping corresponded, his detail differed. Of numberless examples a 15th-century chest (Plate III. <b>fig.</b> <b>6)</b> in the Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin may be referred to. The arrangements of foliage, etc., on top, back and front, are typical of Gothic at its best.|$|E

500|$|The {{commission}} {{made its}} report in July 1961. [...] It {{recommended that the}} Black Country area be administered by large county boroughs, and that the remaining urban districts or municipal boroughs be merged into these authorities. The original county council's responsibility for services within {{the majority of the}} conurbation were curtailed and association with the historic shire was for ceremonial purposes only. The West Midlands Special Review Area included Dudley, Oldbury, Stourbridge and Halesowen (as per <b>Fig.</b> <b>6).</b> The latter two council areas were not incorporated into a county borough, as part of the eventual West Midlands Order 1965. Halesowen was proposed to be included within an enlarged Smethwick County Borough, but a successful campaign entitled [...] "Hands off Halesowen" [...] orchestrated by a non-partisan group called the [...] "Halesowen Independence Committee" [...] helped stop the plans.|$|E
500|$|During these reorganisations, the {{territory}} of the county council grew only where Stourbridge took in the majority of Amblecote Urban District from Staffordshire (See <b>Fig</b> <b>6)</b> and the designation of Redditch in April 1964 as a [...] "New town". Historically, Redditch lies on the county boundary, so any expansion of the newly designated town would either fall under the Green Belt to the north, or the surrounding area of Warwickshire at Matchborough. Therefore, the boundary between the two counties was realigned in favour of Worcestershire, {{as a consequence of the}} Warwickshire and Worcestershire (Boundaries) Order 1969 legislation (Fig 7). The Redditch New Town designation coincided with a programme of considerable social housing development, mainly due to enactment of the Town Development Act 1952. Numerous housing developments took place across the county, especially in Droitwich, Worcester and near to the Birmingham boundary at Frankley, Hawkesley, Kitwell, Rednal, Rubery and Walkers Heath. The majority of these developments were designed to help alleviate the housing and land shortages within Birmingham's boundaries.|$|E

2500|$|In some cases, {{a project}} {{may be so}} {{extensive}} that it requires the complete removal of a panel, or set of panels from public view, which in turn raises other considerations concerning public access. [...] An excellent {{example of such a}} case is the current, on-going project to conserve York Minster funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF), which raises the question: how do conservators accommodate the needs of the living, functioning Minster, without compromising conservation goals (<b>fig.</b> <b>6)</b> (Rosewell 2008a)? [...] For instance, upon the removal of the Great East Window from public view (for up to ten years), a solution was needed to combat the sudden gloom of the Minster’s interior. [...] Ultimately, a remarkable life-sized, digital replica was produced to brighten the “visual ‘black hole’ that remains” while conservation work is taking place, thus facilitating the aims of conservators by minimising the detrimental effects of losing the visual impact window on the interior (fig. 7) (Rosewell 2008b). [...] This {{is not the first time}} that York Minster has employed a variety of methods to maintain and increase public access while also facilitating the conservation of its stained glass legacy. [...] Currently, conserved sections of panels that have been permanently removed from their original context due to conservation concerns can be viewed on display near the choir (fig. 8). [...] Although it is rare that a perfect solution to these concerns can be found, it is a necessary part of conservation planning to take public interest and access into consideration.|$|E
