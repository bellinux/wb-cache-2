5|$|Unaware of Bart's shoplifting, Marge {{takes the}} family to the same store to get their annual Christmas picture taken. Bart tries to avoid {{detection}} and trouble, but is spotted by Brodka, who shows a disbelieving Marge and Homer the security tape of Bart shoplifting. Disappointed by Bart's actions and concerned that she may be mothering <b>him</b> <b>too</b> <b>much,</b> Marge decides that he {{is old enough to}} make his own decisions and becomes distant with him. Fearing he has lost Marge's love, Bart decides he must regain it.|$|E
5|$|In his prime, Iginla was {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} NHL's most prominent power forwards. Upon entering the league, he tried to emulate players like Brendan Shanahan and Keith Tkachuk, hoping to match their combination of finesse and physicality. He is one of the most consistent scorers in the league; between 1998 and 2008, only Jaromír Jágr scored more NHL goals than Iginla. Even so, scouting reports have argued that Iginla's lack of speed makes it easier for opponents to isolate him and restrict his ability to move if his teammates rely on <b>him</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> to lead the offence.|$|E
5|$|Homer test {{drives a}} new {{electric}} car {{so that he}} can get a free gift. After destroying the car, the family returns to the dealer to receive the gift, which Homer forgets to open until he is in bed with Marge. His gift turns out to be free tickets to a preview screening of the new Mel Gibson film, a remake of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. The audience members are given comment cards to fill. The filmmakers can change the film based on the audiences' reactions. The film is enjoyed by everyone but Homer. During the screening, Gibson, having come to the test screening unannounced, is assured by the producers that the film is wonderful. While reading the comment cards after the movie, Gibson is certain that everyone loves <b>him</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> to tell him how to improve the film. When he reads Homer's comments, he thinks that Homer was the only person brave enough to tell him the truth.|$|E

Schultz's first trial ended in a deadlock; prior to his second trial, Schultz had the venue moved to Malone, New York, then moved there and {{garnered}} the sympathy of the townspeople through charitable acts so that {{when it came time}} for his trial, the jury found him innocent, liking <b>him</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> to convict him.|$|E

25|$|After {{the civil}} war, workers' strikes and peasant uprisings broke out across Russia, largely in {{opposition}} to Sovnarkom's food requisitioning project; as an antidote, Lenin introduced a level of market-oriented reform as the New Economic Policy (NEP). There was also internal turmoil in the Communist Party, as Trotsky led a faction calling for the abolition of trade unions; Lenin opposed this and Stalin helped him to drum up support against Trotsky's position. Stalin also agreed to supervise the Department of Agitation and Propaganda in the Central Committee Secretariat. At the 11th Party Congress in 1922, Lenin nominated Stalin as the party's new General Secretary. Although concerns were expressed that adopting this new post {{on top of his}} others would both overstretch his workload and give <b>him</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> power, Stalin was appointed to the position. For Lenin, it was advantageous to have one of his allies in a post crucial for the maintenance of his policies.|$|E
25|$|The Doctor {{initially}} dismisses Jenny as {{an echo of}} what {{it means}} to be a Time Lord, but as they spend more time together he begins to accept her. The Doctor confides privately to Donna that he is resistant to Jenny coming with them in the TARDIS because she reminds <b>him</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of Gallifrey and everything he lost in the Time War. Donna also becomes intrigued by a series of numbered plaques that she notices in each room. When they reach the location of the Source, it turns out to be a terraforming device within a colonising spaceship. Donna realises that the plaques represent the dates each part of the building was completed, which was a mere seven days previous. The humans and Hath have bred so many generations through the progenation machines that their own history has degraded into myth. The original cause of the conflict is determined by the Doctor to have been the death of the mission commander.|$|E
500|$|According to Ellefson, [...] "Millennium of the Blind" [...] was {{originally}} written in 1991 and a demo was recorded, and {{a version of}} the song would later be included as a bonus track on the 2004 remix/remaster of Youthanasia. In the liner notes for the 2004 re-release of Youthanasia, Mustaine claimed that [...] "Millennium of the Blind" [...] reminded <b>him</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of another song he was working on at the time, [...] "Absolution" [...] (which would later form part of [...] "Trust" [...] from Cryptic Writings). Mustaine states in the Youthanasia re-release liner notes that he came up with the lyrics after watching Highlander. Ellefson explained Johnny K and Mustaine were able to finish the song for Thirteen.|$|E

500|$|Steven Spielberg's 2012 film Lincoln, {{in which}} Stevens was portrayed by Tommy Lee Jones, brought new public {{interest}} in Stevens. Jones's character is portrayed as the central figure among the radicals, responsible in large part for {{the passage of the}} Thirteenth Amendment. [...] Historian Matthew Pinsker notes that Stevens is referred to only four times in [...] Doris Kearns Goodwin's Team of Rivals on which screenwriter Tony Kushner based the film's screenplay; other radicals were folded into the character. [...] Stevens is depicted as unable to moderate his views for the sake of gaining passage of the amendment until after he is urged to do so by the ever-compromising Lincoln. According to Aaron Bady in his article about the film and how it portrays the radicals, [...] "he's the uncle everyone is embarrassed of, even if they love <b>him</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> to say so. He's not a leader, he's a liability, one whose shining heroic moment will be when he keeps silent about what he really believes." [...] The film depicts a Stevens–Smith sexual relationship; Pinsker comments that [...] "it may well have been true that they were lovers, but by injecting this issue into the movie, the filmmakers risk leaving the impression for some viewers that the 'secret' reason for Stevens's egalitarianism was his desire to legitimize his romance across racial lines." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN's Meghan Sullivan {{found the}} {{portrayal}} of the cadets' involvement in the war [...] "incredibly moving" [...] and was intrigued by the story's focus on war, but found the need to understand Orience's lore and mythology made the ending convoluted. Becky Cunningham of GamesRadar {{was fascinated by the}} game's setting and the questions it posed about morality and memory, finding the story worth experiencing. Alexa Ray Corriea, writing for GameSpot, generally enjoyed the story despite noting the main plot becoming complicated quickly, but stated that the ending introduced too many new story elements for comfort. Michael Damiani of GameTrailers found the overall story enjoyable, but gaps in story and character development, along with the need to replay the game to get the full story, [...] " [...] you full of questions and doubt from beginning to end." [...] Eurogamer's Chris Schilling was similarly critical of the need to understand terms unfamiliar to series newcomers. He also disliked the length of cutscenes, and the jarring change from grim imagery to lighter subjects like chocobo breeding. Tom Sykes of Official Xbox Magazine said that the setting and story's superficial similarities to the later Harry Potter books improved the story after the confusing opening. Game Informers Matt Miller stated that the story started strongly, but was made less enjoyable when it began focusing on the game's overarching narrative and said the abundance of characters had a negative impact on their characterization. RPGFan's Stephen Meyerink, despite saying the game had [...] "goofy faces and silly moments", found the story and themes engaging. Samuel Roberts of PC Gamer was less positive, feeling that the story and characters reminded <b>him</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of poor-quality anime series.|$|E

2500|$|The {{violent and}} {{aggressive}} Morales {{had begun to}} take over Los Zetas' assets and depose Lazcano in early 2010. In the beginning, Lazcano was happy to have Morales in his ranks, but he underestimated him and gave <b>him</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> power. They rarely met, probably once a month. As tensions grew they spoke only via mobile phone. Morales' active role got him the loyalty and respect of many gang members and eventually many stopped payments to Lazcano. They lived {{in different parts of}} the country and aside from work, they had little in common. Morales preferred violence, while Lazcano was more business-like. Lazcano reportedly wanted Los Zetas to be less of a problem for the Peña Nieto government; in contrast, [...] " [...] is someone who wants to fight the fight." [...] This does not imply, however, that Lazcano [...] "is a saint, but [...] seems to get his basic enjoyment by committing the most incredibly sadistic acts." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{testimony}} before the commission, Jacques Bihozagara, who was presented as [...] "former ambassador to France", claimed that [...] "Operation Turquoise was aimed only at protecting genocide perpetrators, because the genocide continued even within the Turquoise zone." [...] Beside misrepresenting the timeline of the mass killings in the Zone Turquoise, the implication of the testimony as conveyed to the foreign press was that Bihozagara had a sitting ambassador's insight into French policy {{at the time of}} the genocide. In fact, Bihozagara was a founding member of the RPF and close Kagame ally under whose watch as Minister of Rehabilitation the Kibeho Massacre occurred in 1995. His attitude and statements at that time led to reports that he had ordered that massacre, making <b>him</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of a political liability for the RPF to keep as minister. Bihozagara was subsequently ambassador to Belgium, and then to France from September 2001 onwards; but in the intervening period Rwanda had closed its French embassy and purged personnel, precluding continuity of records.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the issue}} of raising taxes, Petty was a {{definite}} proponent of consumption taxes. He recommended that in general taxes should be just sufficient to meet {{the various types of}} public charges that he listed. They should also be horizontally equitable, regular and proportionate. He condemned poll taxes as very unequal and excise on beer as taxing the poor excessively. He recommended a much higher quality of statistical information, to raise taxes more fairly. Imports should be taxed, but only {{in such a way that}} would put them on a level playing field with domestic produce. A vital aspect of economies at this time was that they were transforming from barter economies to money economies. Linked to this, and aware of the scarcity of money, Petty recommends that taxes be payable in forms other than gold or silver, which he estimated to be less than 1% of national wealth. To <b>him,</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> importance was placed on money, 'which is to the whole effect of the Kingdom… not [...] one to 100'.|$|E
2500|$|Frederick's {{pleasure}} with Stutterheim was short-lived, and revived to {{be continued}} throughout the war. [...] Lieutenant Heinrich von Manteuffel, who then commanded against the Swedes in Pomerania, {{must have had a}} better opinion of Stutterheim; he asked for him as commander of his infantry, and the King replied that he should have him, but that Manteuffel should not count on <b>him</b> <b>too</b> <b>much.</b> When, on 28 January 1760, Manteuffel fell into Swedish captivity at Anklam, Stutterheim assumed command. [...] The Russians began their movements against Prussia the middle of August; Stutterheim kept retreating further west toward the Prussian border, much to Frederick's annoyance. [...] The more enterprising Wilhelm Sebastian von Belling [...] had greater success against the same adversaries and managed to hold them at bay for a while until strategic necessities of maintaining communication between both forces required him to reteat. Stutterheim kept his command only because Prince Henry, who was instructed to send someone to relieve Stutterheim, declared that he could not dispense with any of his good generals.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{previously}} denouncing {{tax avoidance}} {{in a speech}} to the European Parliament, in which he attacked European bureaucrats who earned £100,000 a year and paid 12 per cent tax under EU rules, Farage said in 2013 that he had hired a tax advisor to set up the Farage Family Educational Trust 1654, a trust that Farage said was used [...] "for inheritance purposes", on the Isle of Man. Farage later described this [...] "as standard practice", but insisted he [...] "decided I didn't want it. I never ever used it. The Isle of Man is not a tax haven." [...] Farage has since said that this was a mistake, in part because it cost <b>him</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> money, but has criticised the political discourse surrounding tax avoidance as a [...] "race to the bottom". The BBC noted that [...] "The Isle of Man was one of the UK's crown dependencies which signed an agreement on corporate disclosure at a recent meeting with David Cameron amid claims that individuals and firms are using offshore locations to reduce their tax liabilities", adding that the Isle of Man rejects any allegations that they are used for the purpose of tax avoidance.|$|E
