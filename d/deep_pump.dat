40|$|In literature, pumps {{which are}} known as {{vertical}} turbine pump (VTP) {{have been designed to}} work vertically. Today, they {{are known as}} <b>deep</b> well <b>pumps.</b> These pumps are especially used in narrow and very deep wells where the surface sources are insufficient. Therefore, it is necessary to select suitable stage number to benefit from <b>deep</b> well <b>pumps</b> efficiently. In this study, a new <b>deep</b> well <b>pump</b> has been designed and the performances of three stage <b>deep</b> well <b>pumps</b> have been investigated experimentally using different number of blades.

30|$|The side-flow pump has {{a special}} structure. It uses solid plunger instead of hollow plunger, and its {{traveling}} valve is substituted by side-flow valve (Zhao and Liu 2009).

40|$|In {{the world}} today for the {{exploitation}} of oil reservoirs by artificial lift methods are applied different types of <b>deep</b> <b>pumps</b> (piston, centrifugal, screw, hydraulic), water jet pumps and gas lift (continuous, intermittent and plunger). Maximum values of oil production achieved by these exploitation methods are significantly different. In order to select the optimal exploitation method of oil well, the multicriteria analysis models are used. In this paper is presented {{an analysis of the}} multicriteria model's application known as VIKOR, TOPSIS, ELECTRE, AHP and PROMETHEE for selection of optimal exploitation method for typical oil well at Serbian exploration area. Ranking results of applicability of the <b>deep</b> piston <b>pumps,</b> hydraulic pumps, screw pumps, gas lift method and electric submersible centrifugal pumps, indicated that in the all above multicriteria models except in PROMETHEE, the optimal method of exploitation are <b>deep</b> piston <b>pumps</b> and gas lift...|$|R
30|$|<b>Deep</b> <b>pumping</b> with small-diameter pump {{is aimed}} {{to solve the}} problem in old oilfields at their late {{development}} stage (Feng 1990). With the existing pumping units, using small-diameter pump can reduce liquid pressure load which {{is a part of the}} polished rod load. Therefore, the pump depth can be deepened. That helps to improve the pump efficiency.|$|R
30|$|Sucker rod pumping is a {{traditional}} and widely used method of artificial lifting in the world’s oil industry. In recent years, on the one hand, as the natural energy has been depleted and working fluid level is going down, most of old oilfields in the late development stage need <b>deep</b> <b>pumping</b> techniques to increase oil production; on the other hand, deep reservoirs are gradually being developed. For example, the average reservoir depth in Tahe oilfield of Northwest China is more than 6000  m. With the complex geological conditions and bad fluid properties, the working fluid level is very low and rapidly dropping to the limit depth of conventional sucker rod pumping system. The limit depth mainly depends on the polished rod load which increases with the pump depth. However, high polished rod load is disadvantageous to the whole system and even tends to exceed the operating range of the pumping unit. At present, aiming at the problem about how to reduce the polished rod load in the <b>deep</b> sucker rod <b>pumping</b> wells, mainly four rod load reduction techniques have been designed. They are side-flow pump, rod load reducer, fiberglass–steel sucker rod and <b>deep</b> <b>pumping</b> with small-diameter pump.|$|R
30|$|In deep-rod pumping wells, {{polished}} rod load {{tends to}} be very high and even exceeds the operating range of the pumping unit. To tackle the problem, mainly four rod load reduction techniques have been designed till now. They are side-flow pump, rod load reducer, fiberglass sucker rod and <b>deep</b> <b>pumping</b> with small-diameter pump. However, some of them still cause certain problems when put into use. That indicates the fundamental mechanisms of these techniques {{have not yet been}} fully studied. In this paper, on the basis of conventional polished rod load calculation models, the new calculation models for these techniques are respectively established. The rod load reduction effects are comparatively analyzed by calculation. The results indicate that the differences in mechanisms lead to different reduction effects. Side-flow <b>pump</b> and <b>deep</b> <b>pumping</b> with small-diameter pump can largely reduce the liquid pressure load, but its reduction effect for the polished rod load is very limited. On the contrary, fiberglass sucker rod can greatly reduce the polished rod load by decreasing the weight of the sucker rod. Rod load reducer does not change the previous load; instead, it can create an additional reduction force. The potential disadvantages are also discussed. When using a side-flow pump, the resistance on the plunger caused by the liquid pressure would increase. This resistance may cause the sucker rod to bend when it is moving downwards. <b>Deep</b> <b>pumping</b> with small-diameter pump needs to use very small pump {{in order to get a}} relatively good reduction effect, so its application is limited. These disadvantages should be considered in practical application.|$|R
