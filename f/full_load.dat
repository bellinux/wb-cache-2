5|$|At {{the end of}} May 1944, 'D' Company {{left the}} {{battalion}} camp at Bulford in Wiltshire for RAF Tarrant Rushton in Dorset. The base was then secured and Howard briefed everyone on the mission, distributing photographs of the bridges and unveiling {{a model of the}} area. Glider pilot commander Staff Sergeant Jim Wallwork told Howard that with a <b>full</b> <b>load</b> of men, ammunition, assault boats and engineers' stores his gliders would be dangerously overloaded. Howard decided to only take one assault boat per glider and leave behind two men from each platoon. At the last minute, Doctor John Vaughan replaced an injured man in one of the platoons.|$|E
5|$|Most {{newspaper}} mentions of West Corum do {{not report}} {{what sorts of}} cargo she carried, but a January 1922 Associated Press story in The Christian Science Monitor reveals her cargo for one voyage from Argentina. In what the news item said was the first <b>full</b> <b>load</b> of cargo leaving Buenos Aires in nearly a year, West Corum carried 107,000 animal hides, estimated to be enough for 1,000,000 pairs of shoes, along with consignments of wool and linseed. The ship continued calling at Buenos Aires and Santa Fe, Argentina, as late as 1927, but by 1939, West Corum had been laid up in a reserve fleet at New Orleans.|$|E

5|$|Offshore, a ship called Southern Isle was wrecked by {{the high}} surf. It had been sailing from Puerto Rico with a <b>full</b> <b>load</b> of iron ore and, as it {{approached}} the hurricane, the vessel changed directions and slowed down. By October 5, winds were strong and the seas were moderately rough. Very quickly, the ship broke into two, which prevented any time to escape on lifeboats. By {{the day after the}} wreck, rescue boats and helicopters found seven people, one of whom later died from their injuries. Ultimately, 17people died in the event.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{benchmarks}} on {{its official}} website, the Fastra II is {{faster and more}} power efficient than its competitors, including the Fastra I and the Tesla C1060 video card. The benchmarks were performed on the Fastra II, the Fastra I, a 512-core cluster (consisting of Opteron CPUs), an Nvidia Tesla C1060 workstation card on an Intel Core i7 940 CPU, and on an Intel Core i7 940 CPU itself. The Fastra II is over three {{times faster than the}} Fastra I in CT slice reconstruction speed. Although the Fastra II consumes more power than the Fastra I, it's nearly 3 times as energy efficient as the Fastra I, and over 300 times as energy efficient as the 512-core cluster. The video cards run at 37 degrees Celsius when idle, and at 60 degrees Celsius at <b>full</b> <b>load.</b>|$|E
5|$|Vanajan Autotehdas Oy (VAT) was a {{producer}} of heavy vehicles based in Hämeenlinna, Finland. The company was founded as Yhteissisu Oy in 1943 by the Finnish government {{and a number of}} major Finnish companies with the aim of producing lorries and buses for the Finnish Defence Forces. World War II was over before the company could start series production; it was renamed Vanajan Autotehdas and the marque became Vanaja. Subsequently, the production consisted of outdated lorry models, partly built from military surplus materials. After overcoming initial difficulties, the company modernised its products, became profitable and grew until the mid 1950s. Many major components, including engines, were imported. Diesel engines became widely available in 1955, and in 1959 VAT introduced its most significant innovation, the <b>full</b> <b>load</b> lifting tandem axle mechanism, which improved off-road capability significantly; the system is now used in Sisu vehicles.|$|E

5|$|El Orientes first Navy {{voyage to}} France began when she sailed from Newport News with 500 animals on 11 August. Unlike earlier animal {{transport}} crossings for the Army, {{where there was}} {{as much as a}} 4% mortality rate, the voyages in August 1918 and after carried a transport veterinarian and a permanent veterinary detachment to care for the animals while on board the ship. As part of this new program, El Oriente delivered her <b>full</b> <b>load</b> of horses and mules— suffering no losses—at Bordeaux on 2 September. El Oriente made an additional roundtrip with 500 more animals in October, losing only three of her equine cargo during the voyage. El Oriente continued sailing for the NOTS through April 1919, sometimes carrying a small number of troops on return voyages to the United States. At that time El Oriente was converted to carry troops, and assigned to the Cruiser and Transport Force to help return larger numbers American servicemen from Europe.|$|E
5|$|Serving as {{the convoy}} {{flagship}} for Convoy HX-50, Otranto departed New York on 25 September. Six days later, {{on the evening}} of 1 October, the ship accidentally rammed the French fishing schooner Croisine off Newfoundland while the latter was returning home to St. Malo with a <b>full</b> <b>load</b> of cod. The fishing boat passed down the liner's port side and its masts destroyed some of the liner's lifeboats on that side. Captain Ernest Davidson, who was also commodore of the convoy, ordered the convoy to continue while Otranto stopped to rescue the 37 survivors. The derelict Croisine was now a menace to navigation and Davidson ordered his gun crews to sink her later that evening. The liner caught back up with the convoy by daybreak. The following day, the first death from the influenza pandemic occurred and the soldier was buried at sea. Only one other flu death aboard Otranto is recorded, but others may have occurred before she met her end.|$|E
5|$|The C5 {{is powered}} by a 12-volt {{lead-acid}} electric battery driving a motor with a continuous rating of 250 watts and a maximum speed of 4,100 revolutions per minute. It is coupled with a two-stage gear-drive that increases torque by a factor of 13, without which the motor {{would not be able to}} move the vehicle when a person is on board. However, the motor is vulnerable to overheating. The torque increases as the load on the vehicle increases, for instance by going up too steep a gradient. Sinclair's tests showed that it could cope under power with a maximum slope of 1 in 12 (8%) and could manage a 1 in 7 (14%) slope using the pedals. As the speed of the motor reduces, the current flow through its windings increases, drawing up to 140 amps at stall speed. This would very quickly burn the motor out if sustained, so the motor's load is constantly monitored by the C5's electronics. If it stalls under <b>full</b> <b>load</b> the electronics disable the motor after 4 seconds, while if it is under heavy load (around 80 or 90 amps) it trips after two or three minutes. A heat-sensitive resistor inside the motor warns the driver if the vehicle is beginning to overheat and disconnects the motor after a short time, and a third line of defence is provided by a metallic strip mounted on the motor. If an excessive temperature is reached the strip distorts and the power is disconnected.|$|E

40|$|Through {{much of the}} {{anatomical}} and clinical literature bone is studied {{with a focus on}} its structural architecture, while it is rare for bone to be modelled using a structural mechanics as opposed to a continuum mechanics approach in the engineering literature. A novel mesoscale structural model of the femur is presented in which truss and shell elements are used to represent trabecular and cortical bone, respectively. Structural optimisation using a strain-based bone adaptation algorithm is incorporated within a musculoskeletal and finite element modelling framework to predict the structure of the femur subjected to two loading scenarios; a single load case corresponding to the frame of maximum hip joint contact force during walking and a <b>full</b> <b>loading</b> regime consisting of multiple load cases from five activities of daily living. The use of the <b>full</b> <b>loading</b> regime compared to the single load case has a profound influence on the predicted trabecular and cortical structure throughout the femur, with dramatic volume increases in the femoral shaft and the distal femur, and regional increases at the femoral neck and greater trochanter in the proximal femur. The mesoscale structural model subjected to the <b>full</b> <b>loading</b> regime shows agreement with the observed structural architecture of the femur while the structural approach has potential application in bone fracture prediction, prevention and treatment. The mesoscale structural approach achieves the synergistic goals of computational efficiency similar to a macroscale continuum approach and a resolution nearing that of a microscale continuum approach...|$|R
