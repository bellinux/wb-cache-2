25|$|Window Un-Well (a.k.a. Window Well to Hell) - Homeowner hired {{contractor}} to finish basement and install larger windows {{to make a}} living space for her daughter and grandchildren. After reaching the end of her rope and running out of money she fired the contractor. When she noticed the window wells filling with water she called Mike. Along with no provision for drainage he noticed that they had not installed proper lintels above the window to support the brick. Once inside he noticed signs of poor workmanship in the basement finishing. Pulling some drywall for further inspection found improper construction, insulation, electrical and plumbing. Mike tore <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>down</b> and rebuilt the basement, plus corrected the windows.|$|E
500|$|Biller {{sought to}} give a more {{interesting}} look at the Borg, rather than simply focusing on their pursuit of assimilation. With this in mind, he thought of an idea based upon the Tower of Babel. He said that the Borg was a [...] "incredibly interwoven, complex community" [...] and [...] "once you knocked <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>down</b> you would have all these people who spoke different languages, and couldn't communicate with each other. It {{occurred to me that}} a group of ex-Borg would be a very interesting community to explore." [...] He wanted the potential reunification of the ex-Borg to be a moral dilemma. This was based on the growing favorable views of Communism in the Eastern bloc during the mid-1990s after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{about the}} {{conception}} of the album, Aguilera told MTV News that [...] "it is a new beginning, a re-introduction {{of myself as a}} new artist in a way, because for the first time people are really seeing and getting to know who I really am". She also revealed, [...] "Coming off of the height of being a part of such a big pop-craze phenomenon, that imagery of that cookie-cutter sweetheart, without it being me, I just had to take <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>down</b> and get it away from me. And that is why I actually named the album Stripped, because it is about being emotionally stripped down and pretty bare to open my soul and heart". [...] "Walk Away" [...] was written by Aguilera, Scott Storch and Matt Morris, with production handled by Storch.|$|E

500|$|Steve Leftridge from PopMatters {{considered}} the track {{to have a}} [...] "ho-hum" [...] melody. Its melody was compared to Britney Spears' [...] "Everytime" [...] (2003) and Evanescence's [...] "My Immortal" [...] (2003). During the chorus, Perry sings about holding out for a love that is [...] "cinematic and dramatic/With the perfect ending" [...] and later asks {{if she is a}} [...] "stupid girl", according to Elysa Gardner from USA Today and an anonymous reviewer for Portrait Magazine. A reviewer for Portrait Magazine, considering it to be the slowest-paced song on Teenage Dream, said it juxtaposed well with the other tracks. [...] "It takes all the energy {{from the rest of the}} album, all the fast beating hearts and overwhelming feelings of love, and slows <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>down</b> to a song about looking for love instead," [...] they wrote.|$|E
500|$|Originally [...] "Hold Me Now" [...] {{received}} a mixed response from pop music critics. [...] In {{a review of}} the group's album Into The Gap, Parke Puterbaugh, from Rolling Stone magazine, said that the band took a [...] "new and drastic tangent" [...] and that they [...] "have slowed <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>down</b> to bring the human factor into clearer focus", adding that [...] "Hold Me Now" [...] maintains a [...] "hypnotic, swaying groove that suggests reserves of pastoral contentment even {{in the wake of the}} storm". Robert Christgau, in a review for The Village Voice, said that the song [...] "is a classic on chord changes alone, even though Tom Bailey sings it", adding that nothing else in the album Into The Gap [...] "approaches its heart-tugging mastery". J.D. Considine, in a review for The Washington Post, commented that the song's melody adds [...] "accessibility but could easily turn to dreary monotony".|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, Ornstein gave his last public performance. A few years later, {{he and his}} wife—the former Pauline Cosio Mallet-Prèvost (1892—1985), also a pianist—founded the Ornstein School of Music in Philadelphia. Among the {{students}} there, John Coltrane and Jimmy Smith {{would go on to}} major careers in jazz. The Ornsteins directed and taught at the school until it closed with their retirement in 1953. They essentially disappeared from public view until the mid-1970s, when they were tracked down by music historian Vivian Perlis: the couple was spending the winter in a Texas trailer park (they also had a home in New Hampshire). Ornstein had continued to compose music; equipped with a powerful memory, he was not diligent about writing <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>down</b> and had not sought to publicize it for decades. Though his style had tempered greatly since the 1910s, it retained its unique character, and with his rediscovery came a new burst of productivity. In Gann's description, piano works composed by Ornstein in his eighties, such as Solitude and Rendezvous at the Lake, featured melodies that [...] "sprang through endless ornate curlicues that brought no other composer to mind." ...|$|E

500|$|People writer Chuck Arnold {{wrote that}} Spears [...] "never really hit her old stride [...] {{there was a}} lot more {{strutting}} than real choreographic feats from [...] ". Jeff Montgomery of MTV both praised and dismissed Spears's performance saying, [...] "Yes, welcome to Britney's Circus, a big, huge, loud, funny, nonsensical three-ring affair... She looks great in her myriad of outfits, and she can still move with the best of them. [...] It's just, well, she's almost lost in the sheer hugeness of the production around her". Jane Stevenson of Toronto Sun gave Spears's performance three out of five stars stating there was [...] "so much was going on– there were also martial artists, bicyclists, etc.– there was no time to really assess Spears other than to note that she looked great. [...] She could lip-synch the words (one can assume) and strut around the stage well enough, but there was little in the way of genuine passion, joy, or excitement on her part". The Hollywood Reporters Craig Rosen claimed that [...] "in the end, Britney and company delivered an entertaining spectacle, but one couldn't help but wish that she would strip <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>down</b> and show a little more of herself". Sean Daly of St. Petersburg Times summed up all the reviews by stating, [...] "When Britney, touring behind her new Circus album, plays the Times Forum, there will be as many people rooting for her success as her failure. [...] But in the end, we're all envious and thankful, jealous and applauding. We like them/us and hate them/us for the very same reasons".|$|E
500|$|The BBC used viral {{promotion}} on the EastEnders homepage {{to further}} develop {{the character of}} Danielle. A new section named Danielle's Diary was launched, encompassing events in the show from 6 October 2008 onwards, written in diary style from Danielle's point of view. Insight was given into the character's thoughts and feelings on the events surrounding her each week, beginning with the introduction: [...] "Bit new to all this. Need some way to clear my head though. Can't really talk to Stace. Or Callum. Or anyone. Maybe if I write <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>down,</b> my head won't explode... Anyway, welcome to my life in Walford." [...] In this manner, viewers were {{able to keep up}} with the character during her temporary absence from the show in February 2009, when she returned home to Telford following her abortion: [...] "Back in Dawley. Feels strange to be away from Stacey... away from R away from Ronnie. Been sleeping a lot – so tired. When I was younger I never dreamt that I’d go through all of this. Stace keeps ringing, but I can’t speak to anyone. I can’t even listen to my voicemail", and were privy to Danielle's internal worries about her relationship with Ronnie: [...] "It's like I scare R. It was as though she scared herself, as she actually admitted that she cared. For about ten seconds I felt close to her again. Like watching the sun appear from behind a cloud... feeling the warmth across your skin again. But, then it disappears as another cloud sweeps over it." [...] The final entry, dated minutes before Danielle's on-screen death, reads: [...] "All I ever wanted was for mum to look at me with love in her eyes. To call me her baby. To tell me she loved me. I have to leave now. I have to go back to Telford. Goodbye Walford." [...] After the character had been killed off, the diary format gave way to a wall of memorial messages, supposedly penned by other EastEnders characters, including Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald), Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield), Callum and Stacey.|$|E

[...] Further, CSIRO {{for the first time}} had to react to public criticism about its policies.

2500|$|The {{project was}} {{compared}} to releases from White Zombie by Allmusic, who wrote that the album was [...] "complete with thunderous industrial rhythms, drilling metal guitars, and B-movie obsessions." [...] Entertainment Weekly noted the common usage or horror elements in the lyrics, stating Zombie had [...] "concocted a veritable blood feast of hair-raising guitars, spine-tingling drum loops, and a cast of ghoulish characters who could be refugees from an old William Castle horror flick." [...] Tower Records said that Hellbilly Deluxe [...] "continue to explore Zombie's fascination with psychotic noise, pummeling grooves, campy samples, and all things horrific." [...] Legends Magazine stated {{that all of the}} songs on the album [...] "follow the same formula of anger, sex, death, monster, demon, zombie, satanic, drug abuse kinda raw drive a tractor over your neighbor's skull kinda hate the world so I'll burn <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>down</b> music." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{few years}} later her friend Mary Hanford Ford related some of what took place meeting `Abdu'l-Bahá as a second hand account. A few facts are {{detailed}} - Farmer had met `Abdu'l-Bahá and accepted the religion on one occasion, and on another {{wanted to ask him}} a series of questions {{in the context of a}} review of her whole life - but when she wrote <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>down</b> she left the notebook in the hurry of being called to come to him in the early morning. She reported he answered the questions spontaneously and in the right order starting in such a way that the translator was confused because no question had been asked. At the end of that interview she cried [...] "…strange tears of ecstatic happiness, and went to her room to recover the composure which had been shaken by these surprising and illuminating events." [...] This list of questions is referred to in another briefer recollection. Anise Rideout had a similar record of the incident. Rideout reports that `Abdu'l-Bahá wrote an inscription in Farmer's Bible dated March 26. For Maria Wilson's part she also joined the religion and was the first Bahá'í to move to Boston.|$|E
