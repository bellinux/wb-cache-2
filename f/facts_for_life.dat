40|$|Information for {{community}} educators is often in short supply. By educators we mean teachers, health workers, and community organizers involved in promoting healthy practices. Family members sharing knowledge with relatives, neighbours {{and friends are}} the most valuable educators. Food, water and environment are personal and immediate matters. Nutritious food maintains health, promotes growth in children, and prevents blindness. Safe drinking water nurtures and restores; unsafe water, even when it looks clean, is harmful. Puddles and rubbish lying around encourage mosquitos and rats. Clean surroundings, gardens, and properly located latrines can make the neighborhood beautiful and more healthy. Food, Water and Family Health is rich in information and experiences. The manual employs simple dialogue, messages, and illustrations. The arrangement of text and choice of language should make the manual accessible to people with {{a broad range of}} backgrounds and levels of literacy. The whole concept has benefitted from numerous outstanding works such as UNICEF’s successful <b>Facts</b> <b>for</b> <b>Life.</b> Look to the “Bibliography ” and “Sources of Information ” section for mor...|$|E
40|$|New Equipment and {{improvement}} justifications {{are based on}} financial details and alternatives. The datum for all improvements begins {{with the cost of}} the status quo, i. e., no improvement as the launching point for alternatives. Justifications require knowing: 1) when things fail, 2) how things fail, and 3) conversions of failures into money statements. Reliability engineering principles help define when and how things fail to provide <b>facts</b> <b>for</b> <b>life</b> cycle costs comparisons to help decide the lowest long-term cost of ownership driven by a single estimator called net present value (NPV). NPV converts hardware issues and alternatives into money issues. Initial first costs are often a bad decision tool for making improvement decisions (lacking details and alternatives from engineering—the first cost may become the only decision criteria). The Engineering Department is responsibility for providing life cycle costs over the project life and they must provide more than a single alternative for the sales department to get the order. Knowledge about times to failure and failure modes are found by reliability technology. A short example illustrates the methodology.

40|$|Reliability for {{businesses}} begins with management {{and how they}} communicate {{the need for a}} failure free environment to mobilize actions to preserve operable systems and processes. The need for reliability considers cost of alternatives to prevent or mitigate failures, which require knowledge about times to failure, and failure modes which are found by reliability technology. Justifications for reliability improvements require knowing: 1) when things fail, 2) how things fail, and 3) conversions of failures into time and money. Reliability engineering principles help define when and how things fail to provide <b>facts</b> <b>for</b> <b>life</b> cycle costs comparisons. This helps decide the lowest long-term cost of ownership driven by a single estimator called net present value for converting hardware issues and alternatives into money issues. Several short examples illustrate the methodology. Reliability Processes, components, equipment, systems, and people are not perfect and not free from failures. In a naïve, simplistic, and deterministic view, we can have perfection with perfect reliability. In the real world we fall short of perfection (perfection exists only in a fantasy world).

40|$|Childhood {{obesity is}} on the rise in Europe. Schools are {{considered}} a protected environment where children should learn healthy diet and lifestyle habits early on. To this end, Member States have developed policies to guide school food provision among other important aspects. At a JRC workshop entitled 'School Food and Nutrition in Europe: policies, interventions and their impact', participants from national ministries, academia, and non-governmental organisations reviewed and discussed the current state of European school food policy, assessed knowledge gaps and suggested promising ways forward. During stimulating discussions the participants exchanged ideas on recipes for success in the area of school food provision and how to move forward including monitoring and surveillance. Concrete examples in terms of recipes for success were: (1) the building of partnerships, (2) local engagement and co-creation (the co-involvement of head-teachers was seen as crucial) and (3) increasing the availability of healthier options. Support from international organisations includes the EU School Fruit and Milk Schemes, the WHO Childhood Obesity Surveillance Initiative (COSI) and the Health Behaviour in School Children (HBSC) survey, the UNICEF <b>Facts</b> <b>for</b> <b>Life</b> programme, and the pooling of information resources and tools for health promoting schools by the SHE network. Moving forward, the participants highlighted various measures at many different levels from revisiting portion sizes to having benchmarking tools and comparable data. Monitoring and evaluation of school food policies and their implementation and effects are seen as essential and appropriate indicators were discussed. JRC. I. 2 -Public Health Policy Suppor...|$|E
