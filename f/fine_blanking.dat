50|$|One of {{the main}} {{advantages}} of <b>fine</b> <b>blanking</b> is that slots or holes can be placed very near {{to the edges of}} the part, or near to each other.

5000|$|<b>Fine</b> <b>blanking</b> presses {{are similar}} to other metal {{stamping}} presses, {{but they have a}} few critical additional parts. A typical compound <b>fine</b> <b>blanking</b> press includes a hardened die punch (male), the hardened blanking die (female), and a guide plate of similar shape/size to the blanking die. The guide plate is the first applied to the material, impinging the material with a sharp protrusion or stinger {{around the perimeter of the}} die opening. Next a counter pressure is applied opposite the punch, and finally the die punch forces the material through the die opening. Since the guide plate holds the material so tightly, and since the counter pressure is applied, the material is cut in a manner more like extrusion than typical punching. Mechanical properties of the cut benefit similarly with a hardened layer at the cut edge of the part. [...] Because the material is so tightly held and controlled in this setup, part flatness remains very true, distortion is nearly eliminated, and edge burr is minimal. Clearances between the die and punch are generally around 1% of the cut material thickness, which typically varies between 0.5 - 13 mm. Currently parts as thick as 19 mm can be cut using <b>fine</b> <b>blanking.</b> Tolerances between ±0.0003 - 0.002 in are possible, depending on base material thickness and tensile strength, and part layout.|$|E

5000|$|In Bowers's obituary, the English poet Clive Wilmer wrote, [...] "The title poem of his 1990 collection, For Louis Pasteur, announces his key loyalties. He {{confessed to}} celebrating {{every year the}} birthdays of three heroes: Pasteur, Mozart and Paul Valéry, all of whom suggest admiration {{for the life of}} the mind lived at its highest pitch — a concern for science and its social uses, and a love of art that is elegant, {{cerebral}} and orderly." [...] That is one part of Bowers. Another aspect is highlighted by Thom Gunn on the back of Bowers's Collected Poems: [...] "Bowers started with youthful stoicism, but the feeling is now governed by an increasing acceptance of the physical world." [...] That 'physical world' encompasses sex and love which are refracted through his restrained and lapidary lines. The effect of this contrast is striking: at once balanced and engaged; detached but acutely aware of sensual satisfactions. Bowers' style owes much to the artistic ethos of Yvor Winters, under whom Bowers studied at Stanford, but his achievement far surpasses that of his mentor, and his other students, such as J. V. Cunningham. He often wrote in rhyme, but also produced some of the <b>finest</b> <b>blank</b> verse in the English language. He wrote very little (his Collected Poems weighs in at 168 pages), due no doubt to the careful consideration behind every single line. But that care never forecloses on the wilder aspects of human existence—the needs, joys and violence.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{clearance}} {{between the}} {{punch and die}} of a <b>fine</b> <b>blanking</b> tool is an important design factor that affects the sheared surface of a product. In a <b>fine</b> <b>blanking</b> process, the clearance is typically assigned a 0. 5 % material thickness. If the clearance is too big, a fractured surface would occur in the product while if it is too small, bulging would occur. In this study, a setting for optimum clearance was proposed for inner corner shapes by checking shear characteristics and bulging effects according to various clearances. After designing a special part with various corner shapes possessing SPFH 590 (thickness: 4 mm), a high-strength steel material, a <b>fine</b> <b>blanking</b> tool was constructed and <b>fine</b> <b>blanking</b> experiments were conducted.

40|$|By using 'Jianghu' (Rivers and Lakes) as a keyword, {{this study}} aims at {{analyzing}} 'Jianghu' {{in the works of}} three Modern Hunan writers including Xiang Kairan, Shen Congwen and Ding Ling. I argue that different aspects of traditional 'Jianghu' image affect the three writers' creation, and they each re-construct the Jianghu imaginary, with their own different literary ideas. Chapter one explores the etymology of 'Jianghu,' and defines 'Jianghu' from both traditional and modern perspectives. Chapter two discusses Xiang Kairan's Jianghu legend. Xiang Kairan's representation of Hunan is both realistic and mythical. His mystification and demystification of Jianghu/Hunan is a juxtaposition of facts and fiction. As a modern Martial Arts master and writer, Xiang Kairan also tries to modify 'Jianghu' by connecting Martial Arts and Detective fiction. The hybrid of the Chinese and Western literary genres in Xiang Kairan shows the shared dialogues between Jianghu and modern discourses. Chapter three focuses on Shen Congwen's native stories. The <b>fine</b> detail, <b>blanks</b> and insinuation in Shen Congwen's fiction turns Western Hunan into mystery although he makes good use of realistic-style description. Jianghu is resented as a repressed narration in Shen Congwen. In Shen's Jianghu stories, Western Hunan, as a heterotopia, is included in the imagined community of China. Shen Congwen romanticizes the life of both the local army and bandits and thus links Jianghu and the Court. In his imagination, Jianghu is a stage of his own life, and he himself is a modern roaming knight-errant ('xia'). Chapter four looks into the female roaming knight-errant ('nuxia') in Ding Ling's works. As a female and revolutionary writer, Ding Ling creates fierce and unrestrained heroines, who destroy the purity of the author's revolution discourse. Ding Ling tries to balance between self and the nation, the unofficial and the official. Taking the communist revolution as the matrix, Ding Ling's Nuxia stays on the borderline, both approaching and retreating from her matrix. Her anti-Jianghu is thus presented as a Jianghu in an ironic mode. Chapter five concludes Xiang Kairan, Shen Congwen and Ding Ling's Jianghu/ Hunan imagination by connecting keywords such as Jianghu and errantry, Jianghu and revolution, Jianghu and locality...|$|R

The {{results show that the}} <b>fine</b> <b>blanking</b> with negative clearance process can increase the work-hardening degree and further thin the punching surface tissue, inhibit the crack, and make the blanking surface smooth.

40|$|Problem statement: <b>Fine</b> <b>blanking</b> {{process is}} a high {{precision}} process and worldwide in developed countries. Since specimen does not occur fracture {{on the cutting edge}} and {{it is not necessary to}} decorate again in the finishing process for the <b>fine</b> <b>blanking</b> which can be reduced some operation steps. For example, if chain wheel of motorcycle is produced by conventional blanking, it needs nine steps. But, if it is produced by <b>fine</b> <b>blanking,</b> it requires only three steps. With these reasons, <b>fine</b> <b>blanking</b> is boom for the metal forming industry in Thailand. But, due to some mechanical properties for some kinds of metal such as low elongation or imperfect microstructure, it is not cut by using <b>fine</b> <b>blanking</b> directly. Approach: Objective of this research was to investigate microstructure of specimen for <b>fine</b> <b>blanking</b> process in order to avoid fracture surface on blank. The optimum condition will result in higher elongation while having small decrease in tensile strength. The circular specimen with diameter of 16 mm and thickness of 2 mm was chosen. Material was steel which contains 0. 45 % carbon. Results: Microstructures contained pearlite and ferrite grains. The grains sizes were expanded with temperature of heat treatments at 700, 800 and 900 °C, respectively, for 1 h. The specimen exposes to heat treatment in each temperature results in the increase of overall shear surface and the decrease of fracture surface when compared with no heat treatment. This is due to no appearance of strain hardening. For the microstructures exposed to heat treatment at 700 °C for 10 - 20 h were almost spherroidite. It revealed that facture surface became shear surface after heat treatment over 10 h. Conclusion/Recommendations: The changes of microstructure for 0. 45 % carbon steel significantly affected to the overall shear and fracture surface and yield strength due to increasing of spherroidite, thus fracture was decreased with time...|$|E
