5|$|Estimates of Minnie's birthdate vary widely. The National Gallery of Victoria {{estimates}} around 1915; Birnberg's biographical {{survey of}} Indigenous artists from central Australia gives a birth date of around 1920; The new McCulloch's Encyclopedia of Australian Art suggests around 1922; Elizabeth Fortescue's biographical essay in Art of Utopia offers a range between 1910 and 1920. The uncertainty arises because Indigenous Australians often estimate dates of birth {{by comparison with}} other events, <b>especially</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> born before contact with European Australians. Minnie was one of six children, and had three sisters: Molly, born around 1920, Emily, born around 1922, and Galya, born in the 1930s. She was of the Anmatyerre and Alyawarre Aboriginal language groups.|$|E

25|$|Monarchs of the Larantuka Kingdom claim {{descent from}} a union {{between a man}} from the Kingdom of Wehale Waiwuku in South Timor and a mythical woman from a nearby extinct volcano of Ile Mandiri.

25|$|Businesses {{dependent}} on tourism, {{with the exception}} of a few hotels, tend to be small enterprises typically employing fewer than four people; many of these are family run, suggesting an entrepreneurial culture among the local population. However, much of the work generated by this, {{with the exception of}} management, is low skilled and thus poorly paid, <b>especially</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> involved in cleaning, catering and retail.|$|E

25|$|Some {{researchers}} have also criticized how Masters and Johnson define sexual response solely in terms of physiology; for example, Everaerd, and Laan have found that sexual arousal {{can be defined as}} an emotional state in both men and women. Other {{researchers have}} stated that {{there is a lack of}} concordance between women's subjective sexual arousal and their genital arousal. Rosemary Basson argues that this model poorly explains women's sexual response, <b>especially</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> who are in long-term relationships.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{scholarship}} notes, however, {{that the}} English Catholic community {{was not as}} marginalized as might be thought today, <b>especially</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> recusant Catholics whose social position gave them access to the courtly centers of power and patronage. Challoner avoided the houses of the rich, preferred {{to live and work}} among the poor of London, and in his spare hours gave himself to study and writing, which ultimately enabled him to produce several works of instruction and controversy.|$|E
25|$|In the 2006–2007 season, {{the team}} was relegated to the Segunda División B under the {{management}} of ex-Real Madrid legend Míchel after occupying 19th place {{in the league in}} a disappointing season. Míchel received a lot of criticism and accepted all the blame for the team's bad performances, <b>especially</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> who had a wonderful season in the 2005–06 season, such as Rubén de la Red, Esteban Granero and Javi García.

25|$|Some opponents argue that, being {{based on}} a few European languages, Interlingua is best suited for {{speakers}} of European languages. Others contend that Interlingua has spelling irregularities that, while internationally recognizable in written form, increase {{the time needed to}} fully learn the language, <b>especially</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> unfamiliar with Indo-European languages. A related point of criticism is that Interlingua's credential as being Standard Average European is too weak outside the Romance languages. Some opponents see the Germanic, Slavic, and Celtic languages, in particular, as having little influence.|$|E
25|$|For longshoremen nationwide, and <b>especially</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> in the Port of New York, {{this was}} an era of great contradiction, where {{landmark}} legal advances {{to protect the rights}} and safety of workers stood {{in stark contrast to the}} actual conditions for longshoremen. The United States was the only country with a large foreign commerce without any laws to protect the safety of its longshoremen. Even the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, which legalized strikes, boycotts, and peaceful picketing did little to improve actual working conditions for longshoremen.|$|E
25|$|Women {{are more}} likely than men to {{experience}} sexual harassment, <b>especially</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> working in traditionally masculine occupations. In addition, a study indicated that sexual harassment negatively affects workers' psychological well-being. Another study found that level of harassment at workplaces lead to differences in performance of work related tasks. High levels of harassment were related to the worst outcomes, and no harassment was related to least negative outcomes. In other words, women who had experienced a higher level of harassment were more likely to perform poorly at workplaces.|$|E

25|$|Edmonton co-hosted {{the inaugural}} 2002 FIFA U-19 Women's World Championship between August 17 and September 1 along with Vancouver and Victoria. Edmonton was {{the base of}} {{operations}} and featured 12 of the 26 matches. FIFA was originally skeptical to using such a large venue, <b>especially</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> matches which did not involve Canada. The 12 games drew a total 238,090 and an average 19,841 spectators. The final, which saw the United States defeat Canada 1–0 in extra time, was spectated by 47,784; this remains a world-record attendance for youth-level women's soccer.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} copies distributed, either on an average day or on {{particular}} days (typically Sunday), is called the newspaper's circulation {{and is one of}} the principal factors used to set advertising rates. Circulation is not necessarily the same as copies sold, since some copies or newspapers are distributed without cost. Readership figures may be higher than circulation figures because many copies are read by more than one person, although this is offset by the {{number of copies}} distributed but not read (<b>especially</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> distributed free). In the United States, the Alliance for Audited Media maintains historical and current data on average circulation of daily and weekly newspapers and other periodicals.|$|E
25|$|The rapid {{increase}} in population continued {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century as Svendborg developed into an even more important industrial and educational centre. The food and metallurgy sectors became well established. The port prospered with new facilities, including shipyards such as Svendborg Skipsværft which was established in 1907 on an artificial island. On the educational front, a number of maritime and navigational schools were established. The shipyard, which had employed up to 800 in the 1980s finally closed in 2001, some of the facilities being taken over by Vestas. In recent years, there has been a marked transition from industry into the service sector, the hospital now being one of the principal employers. Tourism has also prospered, <b>especially</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> arriving in pleasure boats.|$|E

25|$|The word Estambol has widened {{in meaning}} to include {{exclusively}} the entire European side of Istanbul.

There are few expression denoting the Asian side. Anatol, from Anatolia and Asya, meaning Asia are common words to denote the Asian side of Istanbul. Moreover, el otro lado (literally the other side) is a quite simplistic and descriptory expression for the Asian side of Istanbul, <b>especially</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> living in the European side. Those living in the Asian side however do not use this expression to denote the European side, but simply call it Estambol. The inhabitants are called Estambulí or Estambullí.|$|E
25|$|Changing {{religion}} on one's card {{is extremely}} difficult, <b>especially</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> who are converting from Islam. The Catholic charity Aid to the Church in Need, claims that conversion to Christianity remains prohibited in practise even though Article 46 of the Constitution {{says that the}} state guarantees freedom of belief and religion. Therefore, according to the Vital Statistics Office, a Muslim who is baptised a Christian is still a Muslim. This means that a former Muslim cannot change his or her identity papers to show a new religion or name. The charity claims {{that the lack of}} a law on conversion from Islam to another religion leaves the matter in the hands of judges who must choose between Sharia and the principle of equality of all citizens before the law.|$|E
