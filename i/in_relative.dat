MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a post-hoc analysis of a single-centre retrospective family cohort, we determined if these two proteins could {{increase the risk of}} arterial thrombosis. <b>In</b> total, 1399 <b>relatives</b> were analysed. RESULTS: Annual incidence <b>in</b> <b>relatives</b> with high FVIII levels was 0. 29 % (95 %CI, 0. 22 - 0. 38) compared to 0. 13 % (95 %CI, 0. 09 - 0. 19) <b>in</b> <b>relatives</b> with normal FVIII levels. <b>In</b> <b>relatives</b> with low free protein S levels, this risk was 0. 26 % (95 %CI, 0. 16 - 0. 40), compared to 0. 14 % (95 %CI, 0. 10 - 0. 20) <b>in</b> <b>relatives</b> with normal free protein S levels. Mean FVIII levels adjusted for age and sex were 11 IU/dL, 18 IU/dL, and 21 IU/dL higher <b>in</b> <b>relatives</b> with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity as compared to relatives without these arterial thrombotic risk factors. Moreover, a dose response relation between increasing FVIII and body mass index was found. None of these associations were shown for free protein S. CONCLUSIONS: High FVIII and low free protein S levels seemed to be mild risk factors for arterial thrombosis. High FVIII levels were particularly observed <b>in</b> <b>relatives</b> with traditional arterial thrombotic risk factors. Free protein S levels were not influenced by these thrombotic risk factors.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{substantial}} symptomatic {{overlap between}} depression and dementia {{in old age}} {{may be explained by}} common genetic vulnerability factors. METHODS: We investigated this idea by comparing the occurrence of both disorders <b>in</b> first-degree <b>relatives</b> of 78 patients with Alzheimer disease (AD), of 74 with late-onset depression (onset age of < or = 60 years), of 78 with early-onset depression, of 53 with comorbid lifetime diagnoses of AD/depression, and of 162 population control subjects. Diagnostic information on their 3002 relatives was obtained from structured direct assessments and from family history interviews. RESULTS: The 90 -year lifetime incidence of primary progressive dementia was significantly higher <b>in</b> <b>relatives</b> of patients with AD (30 %) and comorbid AD/depression (27 %) than <b>in</b> <b>relatives</b> of patients with early-onset (21 %) or late-onset (26 %) depression, or of controls (22 %) (P =. 01). Lifetime incidence of depression was significantly higher <b>in</b> <b>relatives</b> of patients with early-onset depression (13 %) than <b>in</b> <b>relatives</b> of patients with AD (10 %) or controls (9. 0 %) (P =. 006). Lifetime incidence of depression was similar <b>in</b> control <b>relatives</b> and <b>in</b> <b>relatives</b> of those patients with comorbid AD/depression (8. 6 %). Relatives of patients with late-onset depression also showed similar occurrence of depression until the age of 80 years, but the figure increased sharply thereafter to 19. 1 % by the age of 90 years.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Genetic {{risk factors}} are {{important}} in Alzheimer's disease (AD). These risk factors might also predispose for other disorders. This {{might lead to a}} familial coaggregation of AD and other disorders, e. g. Down's syndrome or Parkinson's disease. In the present study the risk of physical disorders <b>in</b> <b>relatives</b> of AD patients, of depressed patients and of control subjects were compared. METHODS: Family history and, if possible, interview information on physical disorders and causes of death <b>in</b> <b>relatives</b> of 146 patients with AD, 168 patients with major depression (MD) and 136 controls was collected. Statistical comparisons were performed using chi-square tests and, if necessary, logistic regression analysis accounting for age, gender and interview status. RESULTS: In contrast to our hypotheses, there was no increased risk of cerebrovascular disease, Down's syndrome, haematological malignancies or Parkinson's disease <b>in</b> <b>relatives</b> of AD patients compared with relatives of patients with MD and of controls. The explorative analysis revealed that congenital malformations, i. e. malformations of the heart or of the extremities, were slightly increased <b>in</b> <b>relatives</b> of AD patients. Relatives of patients with AD or MD were at increased risk of dying as a result of accidents, in most cases falls in advanced age, and relatives of patients with MD were at slightly increased risk of dying from gastroenterologic diseases, in most cases complications of peptic ulcers. CONCLUSION: The results do not support a major overlap between the genetic risk of AD and the genetic risk of cerebrovascular disease, Down's syndrome, haematological malignancies or Parkinson's disease. The finding of an increased risk of congenital malformations <b>in</b> <b>relatives</b> of AD patients needs further replication before it can be stated. The increased risk of dementia or depression with cognitive impairment <b>in</b> elderly <b>relatives</b> of patients with AD or MD increases the risk of accidents like falls.

Click to hear Prof. Rosendaal's perspective on venous thrombosis: etiology, pathogenesis, and prognosis Background Women from thrombophilic families have increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), which increases further during oral contraceptive (COC) use and pregnancy-postpartum.

Methods One thousand five female relatives of consecutive patients with VTE from a family-based cohort were retrospectively followed for incident VTE from ages 15 to 50, first VTE, or study inclusion. Absolute and relative VTE risks adjusted for factors of patients (sex, age) and relatives (thrombophilia, COC use, pregnancy) were estimated <b>in</b> <b>relatives</b> of female and male patients and <b>in</b> <b>relatives</b> of female patients with and without hormonally related VTE.
