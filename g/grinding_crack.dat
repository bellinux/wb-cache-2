Fused silica samples (100 mm in diameter x 10 mm thick) were manufactured using the conventional grinding and polishing process. These processed samples are etched with different removal depth. Initially, the surface quality of fused silica samples is characterized in terms of surface roughness and surface defects.

40|$|Abstract The stress {{concentration}} factors (SCFs) in welded connections usually occur at zones with high stress levels. Stress concentrations reduce the fatigue behavior of welded connections in offshore structures and cracking can develop. By using the <b>grinding</b> technique, <b>cracking</b> can be eliminated. Stress concentration factors {{are defined as}} a ratio of maximum stress at the intersection to nominal stress on the brace. Defining the {{stress concentration}} factor is an important stage in the fatigue behavior of welded connections. Several approaches have evolved for designing structures with the classical S-N approach for estimating total life. This work correlates to the stress concentration factors of T-welded connections and the fatigue behavior. Stress concentration factors were computed with the finite element employing 3 D T-welded connections with intact and grinding depth conditions. Then, T-welded connections were constructed with A 36 plate steel and welded with E 6013 electrodes to obtain the stress-life (S-N) approach. The methodology from previous works was used to compute the SCF and fabricate the T-welded connections. The {{results indicated that the}} grinding process could restore the fatigue life of the T-welded connections for SCFs values in the range of 1. 29.

40|$|Legumes have {{increased}} in interest as a locally produced low input protein feed for ruminants in northern Europe. Peas are of special interest in Sweden since they are possible to cultivate on most farms. Protein feed is also a limited resource in organic farming, especially for high producing dairy milk cattle. Farmers often have to complement feed rations with conventional produced protein concentrate. The limitation with all legume grains, including peas, is that their protein is very soluble in the rumen. As a result, the pea protein is almost immediately degraded to a great deal {{and much of the}} protein, which is transformed to ammonia, is lost through the rumen wall, transported with the blood and excecreted with the urine. The consequence is that much nitrogen is lost to the environment instead of being synthesised as microbe protein. Different methods of feed processing, including preservation of feed and milling, rolling and heat treatment could improve protein utilisation. Of great importance affecting rumen degradation rate is particle size in processed peas. The extent to which peas are processed may also affect the passage rate through the rumen.

X-ray diffraction {{was used to}} characterize the residual stresses within the coatings to understand the crack initiation and propagation behavior of samples subjected to axial fatigue loads. Diffraction was also used to establish a baseline stress state of the uncoated high strength steel fatigue specimens. Stress states were evaluated for bare metal, and coated hourglass fatigue specimens that were subjected to low, medium and high cyclic fatigue conditions. Scanning electron microscopy was used to determine coating crack initiation and propagation paths within the coating as well as substrate fatigue site origins.

High magnification inspection also confirmed that substrate fatigue cracks initiate at subsurface inclusions when subjected to low stress conditions and substrate-coating interface defects when subjected to high stress conditions. Subsurface defects are inclusions and impurities from the steel manufacturing process whereas the interfacial defects are imbedded aluminum oxide particles from the grit blasting process used to prepare the substrate surface for coating application.

40|$|Rolling contact {{fatigue crack}} growth {{continues}} to affect many railways worldwide. It {{is most often}} controlled through rail grinding in a preventive maintenance strategy, but to plan the required frequency and depth of <b>grinding,</b> prediction of <b>crack</b> growth rates has a vital role. This paper presents crack growth rate results from a new three-dimensional rail model containing an inclined surface breaking rolling contact fatigue crack. The calculations {{are based on a}} shear mode of crack growth, driven by the Hertzian contact pressure on the railhead and moderated by friction between the crack faces ("crack face friction"). The results from the model show good correlation with those from the previously published work in the area, with particularly good agreement at higher levels of surface friction coefficient. Applying the new model to a range of surface and crack face friction coefficients predicted that crack growth rate will rise with reduced internal crack face friction at all crack sizes. For small cracks (2 and 5 mm radius) rates were predicted to rise with increased surface traction, but this trend was reversed at larger crack sizes (10 and 19 mm radius). Identical trends were found when the modelling was repeated using the previously developed half-space based " 2. 5 d" model, indicating that although this older model cannot represent the rail geometry its high speed means it remains a useful tool for investigating the effects of contact parameters on rail rolling contact fatigue. The next study in this area could therefore consider if there is a uniform or crack size related ratio for mapping 2. 5 d results to three-dimensional rail geometry to produce closer agreement in crack growth rates as well as trends. For the three-dimensional model, consideration of alternative crack morphologies and movement of the contact running band away from the rail centreline would provide additional data on the effect of rail grinding and re-profiling on rolling contact fatigue...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} the preventive maintenance scheduling problem with interval costs (PMSPIC), {{which is to}} schedule preventive maintenance (PM) {{of the components of}} a system over a finite and discretized time horizon, given a common set-up cost and component costs dependent on the lengths of the maintenance intervals. We present a 0 – 1 integer linear programming (0 – 1 ILP) model for the PMSPIC; the model is identical to that presented by Joneja (1990) for the joint replenishment problem within inventory management. We study this model from a polyhedral and exact solutions’ point of view, as opposed to previously studied heuristics (e. g. Boctor, Laporte, & Renaud, 2004; Federgruen & Tzur, 1994; Levi, Roundy, & Shmoys, 2006; Joneja, 1990). We show that most of the integrality constraints can be relaxed and that the linear inequality constraints define facets of the convex hull of the feasible set. We further relate the PMSPIC to the opportunistic replacement problem, for which detailed polyhedral studies were performed by Almgren et al. (2012 a). The PMSPIC {{can be used as a}} building block to model several types of maintenance planning problems possessing deterioration costs. By a careful modeling of these costs, a polyhedrally sound 0 – 1 ILP model is used to find optimal solutions to realistic-sized multi-component maintenance planning problems. The PMSPIC is thus easily extended by side constraints or to multiple tiers, which is demonstrated through three applications; these are chosen to span several levels of unmodeled randomness requiring fundamentally different maintenance policies, which are all handled by variations of our basic model. Our first application considers rail <b>grinding.</b> Rail <b>cracks</b> increase with increasing intervals between grinding occasions, implying that more grinding passes must be performed—thus generating higher costs. We optimize the grinding schedule for a set of track sections presuming a deterministic model for crack growth; hence, no corrective maintenance (CM) will occur between the grinding occasions scheduled. The second application concerns two approaches for scheduling component replacements in aircraft engines. The first approach is bi-objective, simultaneously minimizing the cost for the scheduled PM and the probability of unexpected stops. In the second approach the sum of costs for PM and expected CM—without rescheduling—is minimized. When rescheduling is allowed, the 0 – 1 ILP model is used as a policy by re-optimizing the schedule at a component failure, which then constitutes an opportunity for PM. The policy manages the trade-off between costs for PM and unplanned CM and is evaluated in a simulation of the engine. The third application considers components’ replacement in wind mills in a wind farm, extending the PMSPIC to comprise multiple tiers with joint set-up costs. Due to the large number of components unexpected stops occur frequently, thus calling for a dynamic rescheduling, which is evaluated through a simulation of the system. In each of the three applications, the use of the 0 - 1 ILP model is compared with age or constant-interval policies; the maintenance costs are reduced by up to 16 % as compared with the respective best simple policy. The results are strongest for the first two applications, possessing low levels of unmodeled randomness...|$|R
30|$|Asperity {{degradation}} {{has been}} studied by directly assessing the surface morphology of a rough rock joint before and after shearing. Assuming the asperities on the rock joint surface had identical shape and same inclination angle, Patton (1966) developed the first theoretical model to predict the shear strength of rough rock joints. Although it took into account the effect of roughness of rock joint on its shear strength by a two-dimensional simplification, Patton’s model ignored the scale effect, interlocking effect between the asperities, and roughness evolution during the shearing and damage process of the rock joint. Ladanyi and Archambault (1969) proposed a non-linear theoretical model to predict the shear strength of rough rock joints, which provides better non-linear normal stress - shear stress curves than Patton’s model. However, {{the application of the}} non-linear model required more parameters and some special tests, and some parameters couldn’t well describe the irreversible effect of the roughness on the rock joint shear strength. Barton and Choubey (1977) proposed the well-known shear strength criterion for rough rock joints with the roughness explicitly denoted using the joint roughness coefficient (JRC). Plesha (1987) took into account roughness degradation and developed a two-dimensional theoretical model for rough rock joints {{on the basis of the}} theory of plasticity and the assumption of uniform tooth-shaped asperities. Amadei and Saeb (1990) developed a two-dimensional nonlinear elastic constitutive model for rough rock joints, which considered the different normal deformability of rock joints with mated and unmated initial positions and the effect of the deformability on the failure behaviour. Souley et al. (1995) extended the Amadei-Saeb model to include the shear behaviour of rough rock joints under cyclic loading. Haberfield and Johnston (1994) developed a mechanically-based model for rough rock joints capable of capturing the basic mechanisms of movement and making reasonably accurate predictions of shear displacement behaviour. Maksimovic (1996) proposed a non-linear joint failure model of hyperbolic type with three parameters: the basic angle of friction, the roughness angle and the median angle pressure. More recently, many joint constitutive models have been developed for the physical–mechanical behaviour of rock joints (Indraratna and Haque 2000; Olsson and Barton 2001; Seidel and Haberfield 2002; Serrano et al. 2014; Indraratna et al. 2015; Hencher and Richards 2015; Shrivastava and Rao 2015). However, these constitutive models have difficulty in implementing the real geometry of rock joints and the input parameters of these models are predefined by the user, which hampers the predictive capability of these models (Bahaaddini et al. 2015). Moreover, they are unable to trace the process of asperity shearing and degradation, and gouge formation and <b>grinding,</b> and the <b>crack</b> propagation inside the intact materials of the joint surfaces.|$|R
40|$|Surface {{integrity}} {{is of great}} significance in grinding performance since grinding process is often used as a finishing step. For metallic materials, residual stresses {{play an important role}} in surface integrity for its strong effect on fatigue life, corrosion resistance, and part distortion. For ceramic materials, the surface damage induced by grinding process could greatly affect the mechanical strength and surface finish of the component. The functional behavior of machined components can be enhanced or impaired by the grinding process. Because of this, understanding the surface integrity imparted by grinding is very important. The use of fluid is common in grinding process, however, the high cost and environmental impact of the conventional flood cooling is very undesirable. The minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) have been introduced in industry for about two decades as a promising alternative to conventional flood cooling for economical and environmental advantages. A comprehensive understanding of the MQL effect on the process performances and surface {{integrity is}} of great value to the implementation of MQL technique in industrial situation. Grinding-induced residual stress prediction has been a topic of research since the 1970 ’s while the studies of MQL grinding is still on the early stage with experimental investigations. A comprehensive study and quantitative description of MQL effect on the residual stress generation in grinding is highly demanded. On the other hand, although there has been significant research in the area of surface damage in ceramic grinding, there are still opportunities for advancing predictive methods. Therefore, the objectives of the current research are set as follows: (1) develop a method of predicting residual stress based on an analytical description of the grinding process under MQL condition, (2) develop a method of predicting surface finish and damage in ceramic grinding, and (3) validate the model with experimental data. The research will first focus on predicting residual stresses in MQL grinding based on first principles. This includes predictive models of grinding forces, and grinding temperature stemmed from grinding kinematics and dynamics principles as part of the overall modeling effort. The effect of MQL on both lubrication and cooling aspects has been integrated into these models. The mechanical and thermal output parameters will serve as the basis for determining the loading history which generate residual stresses. The research will also aim at surface roughness modeling in ceramic grinding. A ductile-brittle mixed surface generation is predicted based on the nature of ceramic materials and <b>grinding</b> kinematics. The <b>crack</b> system developed from indentation fracture mechanics approach will be utilized in evaluating the brittle mode surface generation. The modeling techniques will be applied to a range of grinding conditions and materials.

40|$|The {{tribological}} {{and mechanical}} behavior of coated tools depends {{not only on}} intrinsic properties of the deposited film but also on substrate surface and subsurface properties – such as topography and residual stress state – {{as well as on}} interface adhesion strength. It is particularly true in the case of coated tools based on WC-Co cemented carbides (backbone materials of the tool manufacturing industry, and simply referred to as hardmetals in practice) as substrates. Manufacturing of hardmetals often involves grinding, {{and in the case of}} cutting tools also edge preparation, etching and coating. The quality of the shaped components is influenced by how the surface integrity evolves through the different process steps. In this regard, substrate grinding and coating deposition represent key steps, as they are critical for defining the final performance and relative tool manufacturing cost. Within this framework, it is the main objective of this thesis to assess the influence of substrate surface integrity on different mechanical (flexural strength and contact damage resistance under spherical indentation) and tribological (scratch resistance as well as cracking and delamination response under Brale indentation) properties for a TiN-coated fine-grained hardmetal grade (WC- 13 wt. %Co). In doing so, three different surface finish conditions are studied: as-sintered (AS), ground (G), and mirror-like polished (P). Moreover, aiming for an in-depth analysis of surface integrity evolution from grinding to coating, a relevant part of the work is devoted to document and understand changes induced by grinding in nude hardmetal substrates. The study is also extended to a fourth surface finish variant (GTT), corresponding to a ground substrate which is thermal annealed before being ion etched and coated. Because residual stress induced by grinding are effectively relieved after this high temperature thermal treatment, GTT condition allows to separate grinding-induced effects associated with surface texture and surface/subsurface damage changes (inherited from the G surface finish) from those related to the referred residual stresses. Surface integrity was characterized in terms of roughness, residual stresses (prior and after coating deposition), and damage at the subsurface level. It was found that grinding induces significant alterations in the surface integrity of cemented carbides. Main changes included relevant roughness variations; emergence of a topographic texture; anisotropic distribution of microcracks within a subsurface layer of about 1 micron in depth; severe deformation, microstructure refinement and phase transformation of binder regions, down to 5 microns in depth; and large compressive residual stresses, gradually decreasing from the surface to baseline values at depths of about 10 - 12 microns. Additional changes in surface integrity are induced during subsequent ion etching and coating deposition. In general, removal of material from the surface during sputter cleaning and extended low-temperature (during film deposition) treatment resulted in a significant residual stresses decrease (about half its original value). However, damage induced by grinding was not completely removed, and some microcracks were still left on the substrate surface (close to the interface). On the other hand, and as expected, high temperature annealing (GTT condition) resulted in a complete relief of the referred residual stresses, but without inducing any additional change in terms of existing microcracks and depth of damaged layer. This was not the case for the metallic binder phase where thermal treatment induced an unexpected microporosity, development of a recrystallized subgrain structure, and reversion of grinding-induced phase transformation. Flexural strength was measured on both uncoated and coated hardmetals, and complemented with extensive fractographic analysis. It was found that grinding significantly enhances the strength of hardmetals, as compared to AS and P conditions. However, such beneficial effect was partly lost in the corresponding coated specimens. On the other hand, film deposition increases strength measured for GTT surface variant. These findings were analyzed on the basis of the changes on nature and location of critical flaws, induced by the effective residual stress field resulting at the surface and subsurface after each manufacturing stage. The influence of substrate surface finish on scratch resistance of coated hardmetals and associated failure mechanisms was investigated. It was found that coated AS, G and P samples exhibit similar critical load for initial substrate exposure and the same brittle adhesive failure mode. However, damage scenario was discerned to be different. Substrate exposure was discrete and localized to the scratch tracks for G samples, while a more pronounced and continuous decohesion was seen for AS and P ones. Relieving of the substrate compressive residual stresses (GTT condition) yielded lower critical loads and changes in the mechanisms for the scratch-related failure, the latter depending on the relative orientation between scratching and <b>grinding</b> directions. The <b>cracking</b> and delamination of TiN-coated hardmetals when subjected to Brale indentation was studied while varying the microstructure and surface finish of the substrate. In this case, another fine-grained WC-Co cemented carbide with lower binder content (6 wt. %Co) was included in the investigation. It was found that polished and coated hardmetals exhibit more brittleness (radial cracking) and lower adhesion strength (coating delamination) with decreasing binder content. Such a response is postulated on the basis of the influence of intrinsic hardness/brittleness of the hardmetal substrate on both cracking at the subsurface level and effective stress state, particularly regarding changes in shear stress component. On the other hand, grinding was discerned to promote delamination, compared to the polished condition, but strongly inhibits radial cracking. This was the result of the interaction between elastic-plastic deformation imposed during indentation and several grinding-induced effects: remnant compressive stress field, pronounced surface texture, and microcracking within a thin microcracked subsurface layer. It is then concluded that coating spallation prevails over radial cracking as the main mechanism for energy dissipation in ground and coated hardmetals. Contact damage resistance of coated hardmetals with different substrate surface finish conditions was investigated by means of spherical indentation under increasing monotonic loads. It was found that grinding enhanced resistance against both crack nucleation at the coating surface and subsequent propagation into the hardmetal substrate. Hence, crack emergence and damage evolution was effectively delayed for the coated G condition, as compared to the reference P one. The observed system response was discussed on the basis of the beneficial effects associated with compressive residual stresses remnant at the subsurface level after grinding, ion-etching and coating. The influence of the stress state was further corroborated by the lower contact damage resistance exhibited by the coated GTT specimens. Finally, differences observed on the interaction between indentation-induced damage and failure mode under flexural testing pointed in the direction that substrate grinding also enhances damage tolerance of the coated system when exposed to contact loads...|$|R
