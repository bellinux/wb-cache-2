They are placed under command of Colonel Rick Flag {{to be used as}} <b>disposable</b> <b>assets</b> in high-risk missions for the United States government. Each member has a nano bomb implanted in their neck, designed to detonate should any member rebel or try to escape.|$|E

Last year Asia had toppled Europe.Citigroup in The Wealth Report 2012 stated that Asian centa-millionaire overtook North America's wealth {{for the first}} time as the world's [...] "economic center of gravity" [...] continued moving east.

40|$|Abstract: This paper reports some of {{the results}} of a study to explore {{vulnerability}} contexts i. e. trends, shocks and local cultural practices that affect livelihood assets i. e. natural capital (land, water, biodiversity), physical capital (infrastructure, machinery), human capital (labour, skills), financial capital (savings, <b>disposable</b> <b>assets),</b> and social capital (rights, support systems) in Abesard, Iran. It also describes structures, including organizations (government, private), and processes, including policies, laws and incentives, that determine the livelihood strategies of households (agricultural intensification or expansion, livelihood diversification, and migration) which, in turn, impact the assets. Participatory vulnerability analysis (PVA) was used within a sustainable rural livelihoods (SRL) framework to assess the differences of the livelihoods of poor, average, and better-off households. Findings revealed that land use change, climate change, market fluctuations and higher mechanization were the main contexts of vulnerability that led to noticeable differences between households, particularly in human resources, landholdings, equipments, linkages, credits and markets, affecting the livelihood strategie...|$|E

50|$|The {{mechanics}} of Herzog Zwei have a slower feel than most modern RTS games. The player's {{view of the}} screen is always centered on the player's mech. The player can pilot the mech to any location on the map while shooting at enemy units, airlifting friendly ground vehicles, or placing purchase orders for more vehicles. If the mech is destroyed in battle (or runs out of fuel), a new mech respawns over the player's primary base. Unlimited respawning allows the mech to engage in suicide tactics, as it is essentially a <b>disposable</b> <b>asset.</b>|$|R
40|$|The recent {{explosion}} in proposed microsatellite missions {{is based on}} the possibility to mass-produce cheap platforms capable to deliver acceptable performance over a limited lifetime. The assumption behind such scheme is that individual microsatellites are expected/allowed to fail in reasonable numbers, the resulting degradation of constellation performance being limited due to the large population of active spacecraft. We argue that cheap platforms do not necessarily need to be seen as <b>disposable</b> <b>assets,</b> so that low cost constellations featuring a low number of microsatellites may nevertheless be capable of remarkable performance. The key technology needed to enable such feat is low power electric propulsion, whereby microsatellites are allowed to acquire and maintain precisely tuned orbital locations, compensate atmospheric drag to fly longer, and de-orbit safely at end of life. A number of such microsatellites may be fitted with an instrument each from a suite of different sensors operating in various spectral bands. The constellation would operate as an actively controlled system, with the individual instruments providing well coordinated raw data that may be processed using data fusion techniques to yield the final product. Starting from the proven performance of a currently available low power Hall thruster, we present general design criteria for constellations based on a 50 kg-class microsatellite bus. The potential benefits of such technology are outlined with respect to applications such as precision farming, urban area monitoring, and dual use land surveillance...|$|E
50|$|Despite {{acted as}} the second largest {{shareholder}} of Intesa Sanpaolo by 5.8% voting rights on 31 December 2009, Crédit Agricole listed the bank as <b>disposable</b> <b>asset,</b> at the same time, the two banking group agreed to transfer some branches to Crédit Agricole, which under the ownership of Cariparma in 2010 or 2011. In 2011 the transaction was completed, which Cariparma acquired Carispezia, as well as 96 branches directly from Intesa Sanpaolo Group (11 from Banca CR Firenze to Cariparma directly; 70 of remaining 85 branches from Intesa Sanpaolo to Cariparma directly and 15 to FriulAdria), for €740 million. At {{the same time in}} the first half of 2010, Crédit Agricole reduced the share holding on Intesa Sanpaolo to 4.79% of the total share capital (4.99% voting rights). Crédit Agricole finally sold all the shares on Intesa Sanpaolo in 2012, which Cariparma became the major arm of the group participation in Italy.|$|R
40|$|In {{a recent}} article in the Journal. Doran, Low, and Kemp (DLK) argue that Swazi herders hold cattle as a store of wealth apart from their {{productive}} value. In Swaziland, "insofar as cattle are regarded as an end in themselves, they cannot be likened to conventional <b>disposable</b> productive <b>assets</b> which are held as long as their capital value in production exceeds their current market value " (DLK, p. 42). DLK believe that the store-of-wealth motive in-duces herders to maintain individual animals, be-yond the age of optimum slaughter (for beef pur-poses) and to increase the herd beyond the size which would maximize beef production. In support of this hypothesis, DLK draw on a variety of beef industry statistics...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of <b>disposable</b> income and <b>assets</b> on {{consumer}} spending trends in China. By employing the vector error correction model on the national quarterly data, we demonstrate that the wealth effects arising from asset value changes are remarkable. There is only one long-run cointegrating relationship among income, consumption, and assets. The long-run consumption elasticity of assets {{is found to be}} around 0. 51. In addition, evidence shows that assets will restore the equilibrium relationship in the long run when the system is disturbed by external shock. Variance decomposition analysis indicates that assets render a more lasting pronounced impact than income on consumption variations in China. ...|$|R
40|$|A century ago, {{everyone}} thought time and distance were well defined physical concepts. But neither proved absolute. Instead, measures/reports {{of time and}} distance were found to depend on one%u 2019 s reference point, specifically one%u 2019 s direction and speed of travel, making our apparent physical reality, in Einstein%u 2019 s words, %u 201 Cmerely an illusion. %u 201 D Like time and distance, standard fiscal measures, including deficits, taxes, and transfer payments, depend on one%u 2019 s reference point/reporting procedure/language/labels. As such, they too represent numbers in search of concepts that provide the illusion of meaning where none exists. This paper, dedicated to our dear friend, David Bradford, provides a general proof that standard and routinely used fiscal measures, including the deficit, taxes, and transfer payments, are economically ill-defined. Instead these measures reflect the arbitrary labeling of underlying fiscal conditions. Analyses based on these and derivative measures, such as <b>disposable</b> income, private <b>assets,</b> and personal saving, represent exercises in linguistics, not economics. ...|$|R
