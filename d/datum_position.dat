40|$|In this {{contribution}} we formulate {{and solve}} the problem of determining transformation parameters in the transformation between a geodetic coordinate system (G-System) and the Conventional Terrestrial (geocentric) coordinate system (CT-system), or equivalently, between the datums associated with these systems. The transformation parameters are obtained from a set of points whose positions (coordinates) are known both, in the CT-system and in the G-system. It is shown that if the heights of these points above the horizontal datum are disregarded, as Vanek and Steeves [1996] argued they should be, one can obtain transformation parameters of a horizontal <b>datum</b> <b>positioned</b> at “the origin of the geodetic network ” (called also the “datum point”, or “fundamental datum point ” by some people) and oriented with respect to the Local Astronomical coordinate system at this “origin”, to a very good accuracy.

The {{precision}} machining {{of the rail}} base for high-speed Magnetically Levitated Trains (MAGLEV) is the precondition for laying the high-quality whole rail and accomplishing the integrative performance test of the train. A new method is advanced to improving the machining precision in this paper. The X and Y coordinates of the cross centers on the rail base for MAGLEV will be obtained through two raster displacement sensors which are perpendicular to each other. So the machining <b>datum</b> <b>position</b> of the rail will be determined. According to the spatial position relationship between the straight movement error of the guideway on the numerical control machine tools and the central line of the rail base for MAGLEV, error compensation {{will be made to}} improve the machining precision in the process of the numerical control machining. The mechanism design theory of the measuring system is presented in this paper.

40|$|Currently, the International Bathymetric Chart of the Arctic Ocean (IBCAO) [Jakobsson et al. 2000], {{contains}} the most up-to-date digital bathymetric {{model of the}} entire Canadian Arctic Archipelago. IBCAO is a seamless bathymetric/topographic Digital Terrain Model (DTM) that incorporates three primary data sets: all available bathymetric data {{at the time of}} compilation; the US Geological Survey GTOPO 30 topographic data; and the World Vector Shoreline for coastline representation. The horizontal grid cell size is 2. 5 x 2. 5 km on a Polar Stereographic projection, which is adequate for regional visualization and analysis, but which may not be sufficient for certain geoscientific and oceanographic applications. However, the database that was constructed during the IBCAO project holds bathymetric data of a high quality throughout most of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, justifying a compilation resolution that is better than 2. 5 x 2. 5 km. This data is primarily from historical hydrographic surveys that were carried out by the Canadian Hydrographic Survey (CHS). The construction of a higher resolution bathymetry/topography DTM of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (complete with an error estimation of interpolated grid cells) requires a consideration of historical metadata which contains detailed descriptions of horizontal and vertical <b>datums,</b> <b>positioning</b> systems, and the depth sounding systems that were deployed during individual surveys. A significant portion of this metadata does not exist in digital form; it was not available during the IBCAO compilation, although due to the relatively low resolution of the original DTM (2. 5 x 2. 5 km), its absence was considered a lesser problem. We have performed 2 ̆ 2 data detective 2 ̆ 2 work and have extracted some of the more crucial metadata from CHS archives and are thus able to present a preliminary version of a seamless Digital Terrain Model of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. This represents a significant improvement over the original IBCAO DTM in this area. The use of a merged seamless bathymetry/topography model substantially facilitates the overlay and incorporation of other spatially referenced geological and geophysical datasets. For example, one intended use of the model is to merge the results from the mapping of regional glacial morphology features, in order to further address the glacial history of the region...|$|R

Malaysia, as yet, employs a static datum, i. e., GDM 2000, at epoch 2000; though Malaysia has evidently been affected by seismic activity for the past decade. Therefore, this paper seeks to propose a design for implementing a semi-dynamic datum for Malaysia. Methodologically, GPS time series analyses are carried out to investigate the seismic activity of Malaysia, which essentially contributes to the proposed design of the semi-dynamic datum for Malaysia. The implications of implementing a semi-dynamic datum for Malaysia are discussed as well. The results indicate that Malaysia undergoes a complex deformation; whereby the earthquakes – primarily the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman, 2005 Nias and 2012 Northern Sumatra earthquakes – have affected the underlying secular velocities of Malaysia. Consequently, from this information, the proposed design, particularly the secular and non-secular deformation models, is described in detail. The proposed semi-dynamic datum comprises a transformation, temporal, and spatial module, and utilizes a bilinear interpolation method. Overall, this paper aims to contribute to the feasibility of a semi-dynamic datum approach for Malaysia...|$|R

40|$|The gravity {{observations}} of the satellite GOCE have a global homogeneous coverage and precision. This data set constitutes an independent new tool to control the quality of terrestrial gravity data. Terrestrial data reach higher resolution and precision, but can be affected by errors due to factors such as different vertical geodetic <b>datums,</b> wrong <b>position</b> in latitude and longitude, geodynamic effects and gravimeter drift, which tends to accumulate over long distances. Terrestrial data recover gravity signals at shorter wavelengths compared to the GOCE satellite, but the average gravity anomaly values {{can be compared to}} the GOCE derived values which are bandlimited to lower frequencies. We consider the area of the Amazon Craton, and in particular the Solim̃oes, Amazon and Parnaiba Basins, and part of the Tocantins and S̃ao Francisco Provinces in Brazil, to estimate the systematic errors in terrestrial gravity data. We calculate the average terrestrial gravity anomaly by spatial averages applying Gaussian, inverse distance and simple averages, which allows to compare the long- and medium-wavelength part of the terrestrial gravity anomalies with the gravity field derived from GOCE. We also consider the combined satellite-terrestrial model EGM 2008 up to degree and order 250 (i. e. maximum expansion from satellite GOCE). The results show that the systematic errors range from about − 28. 1 to 25. 2 mGal with a standard deviation value of 6. 4 mGal. The mean value over the study area is about zero, obtaining 0. 27 mGal difference between the Gaussian average of the terrestrial gravity data and the gravity data from the GOCE satellite-only model and is smaller than the commission error associated to the geopotential model. Also, we verified that 64. 8 percent of the study area does not present systematic errors, as their difference is within the commission error of 5. 1 mGal of the GOCE model in the harmonic expansion up to degree 250. The comparison of the terrestrial data with the model EGM 2008 gives slightly smaller differences, which {{can be attributed to the}} fact that the EGM 2008 contains terrestrial data. The results vary only slightly according to the type of averaging used, with improved values for the Gaussian average. The analysis also shows where the terrestrial data are scarce and require an improvement in data coverage in order to correctly represent the gravity field.

The advantages of MIS include reduced operative trauma and fewer complications leading to faster patient recovery, better cosmetic results and shorter hospital stays. As {{the demand for}} MIS procedures increases, effective surgical training tools must be developed to improve procedure efficiency and patient safety. Motion tracking of laparoscopic instruments can provide objective skills assessment for novices and experienced users. The most common approaches to noncontact motion capture are optical and electromagnetic (EM) tracking systems, though each approach has operational limitations. Optical trackers are prone to occlusion {{and the performance of}} EM trackers degrades in the presence of magnetic and ferromagnetic material. The cost of these systems also limits their availability for surgical training and clinical environments. This thesis describes the development and validation of a novel, noncontact laparoscopic tracking system as an inexpensive alternative to current technology.
