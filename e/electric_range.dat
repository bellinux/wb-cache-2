40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{optimisation}} of the energy storage system of a parallel hybrid plug-in car. The objective is to study how the <b>electric</b> driving <b>range</b> is influenced by factors such as package volume and auxiliary power consumption. Simulation and optimisation are used {{to find the most}} cost effective battery arrangement for specified <b>electric</b> driving <b>range,</b> volume, power and lifetime requirements. Two battery technologies, NiMH and Li-ion, are included in the simplified case study. The result indicates that the battery cost and size are highly dependent on the required <b>electric</b> driving <b>range.</b> It is found that a 3 ± 5 km <b>electric</b> driving <b>range</b> is possible with a minor cost increase. An <b>electric</b> driving <b>range</b> of 15 ± 25 km is possible, but results in a more bulky, and much more costly, battery system.
