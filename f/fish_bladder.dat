In control conditions the transepithelial potential was zero and the intracellular potential was - 56 mV. The intracellular ionic activities measured with single- and double-barrel ion-sensitive micro-electrodes for the first time in a <b>fish</b> <b>bladder</b> (aiNa = 16 mM, aiK = 87 mM, and aiCl = 21 mM) indicate an active accumulation of K and Cl ions and an active extrusion of Na ions by the cell. The maintenance of intracellular Cl activity above its equilibrium value depended on the presence of Na ions in the mucosal medium, but was independent of the presence of K ions. Flat cable analysis yielded values for transepithelial, apical, basolateral and shunt resistances of 197, 2790, 1986 and 205 omega cm- 2 respectively. Equivalent circuit analysis using amphotericin B yielded similar values for shunt resistance. The paracellular pathway accounts for 96 % of transepithelial current flow and this epithelium may be classified as 'leaky'. The cells are electrically coupled with a space constant of 354 micron. Amphotericin B when added to the mucosal solution induced an immediate serosa positive transepithelial potential of about 9 mV and a short-circuit current of 64 microA cm- 2. The Vt was ouabain sensitive and dependent on mucosal Na concentration. The origin of the antibiotic induced transepithelial potential was an increase in the sum of the cell membrane electromotive forces. The apical membrane potential depolarized to - 7 mV and its resistance fell to 433 omega cm- 2. During the first 10 min of exposure aiNa increased to 80 mM and aiK decreased to 7 mM with only a small change in aiCl.

In order to identify the adulterants and authenticate EBN, efforts were made to investigate and compare the protein and amino acid profiles of cave and house EBNs with white fungus, jelly, <b>fish</b> swimming <b>bladder</b> and egg white. The protein profiling indicated 10 bands for cave nests with two strong bands at 30 and 35 kDa. House nest proteins consisted of 9 bands with major bands at 120 and 140 kDa. White fungus displayed three dim bands at 22, 35 and 75 kDa whereas egg white was found to contain two predominant bands at 35 and 75 kDa. <b>Fish</b> swimming <b>bladder</b> showed substantial streaking of protein bands after dilution whereas the protein profile of jelly did not present any band. The amino acid analysis revealed that EBN consisted of 17 types of amino acids. The major amino acids in cave and house nests were aspartic acid, arginine, histidine & leucine, and aspartic acid, glutamic acid, histidine & leucine, respectively. White fungus consisted of 16 types of amino acids in concentrations lower than that in EBN samples. <b>Fish</b> swimming <b>bladder</b> was rich in 6 amino acids.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{association}} between fish consumption {{and risk of}} bladder cancer has not been established yet. The results from epidemiological studies are inconsistent. Methods We conducted a meta-analysis of cohort and case-control studies {{on the relationship between}} <b>fish</b> intake and <b>bladder</b> cancer. We quantified associations with bladder cancer using meta-analysis of relative risk associated to the highest versus the lowest category of fish intake using random effect models. Heterogeneity among studies was examined using Q and I 2 statistics. Publication bias was assessed using the Begg's funnel plot. Results Five cohort and 9 case-control studies were eligible for inclusion. The combined relative risk showed that fish consumption was negatively, but not significantly, associated with a decreased risk of bladder cancer (relative risk, 0. 86; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 61 - 1. 12). In subgroup analyses, {{there was no evidence that}} study design, geographical region, case sample size, or exposure assessment substantially influenced the estimate of effects. Conclusion The overall current literature on fish consumption and the risk of bladder cancer suggested no association. Because of the limited number of studies, further well-designed prospective studies are needed to explore the effect of <b>fish</b> on <b>bladder</b> cancer. </p...|$|R

50|$|The {{cartilaginous}} fish (e.g., {{sharks and}} rays) split {{from the other}} fishes about 420 million years ago, and lack both lungs and swim bladders, suggesting that these structures evolved after that split.

500|$|The lungs of today's {{terrestrial}} vertebrates {{and the gas}} <b>bladders</b> of today's <b>fish</b> {{are believed}} to have evolved from simple sacs, as outpocketings of the esophagus, that allowed early fish to gulp air under oxygen-poor conditions. These outpocketings first arose in the [...] bony fish. In most of the ray-finned fish the sacs evolved into closed off gas bladders, while a number of carp, trout, herring, catfish, and eels have retained the physostome condition with the sack being open to the esophagus. In more basal bony fish, such as the gar, bichir, bowfin and the lobe-finned <b>fish,</b> the <b>bladders</b> have evolved to primarily function as lungs. The lobe-finned fish gave rise to the land-based tetrapods. Thus, the lungs of vertebrates are homologous to the gas <b>bladders</b> of <b>fish</b> (but not to their gills).|$|R

5|$|To attract mates, some teleosts produce sounds, {{either by}} stridulation or by {{vibrating}} the swim bladder.

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{simple and}} {{reproducible}} method {{has been developed}} for following fluid transport by an in vitro preparation of mammalian gall bladder, based upon weighing the organ at 5 minute intervals. Both guinea pig and rabbit gall bladders transport NaCl and water in isotonic proportions from lumen to serosa. In the rabbit bicarbonate stimulates transport, {{but there is no}} need for exogenous glucose. The transport rate is not affected by removal of potassium from the bathing solutions. Albumin causes a transient weight loss from the gall bladder wall, apparently by making the serosal smooth muscle fibers contract. Active NaCl transport can carry water against osmotic gradients of up to two atmospheres. Under passive conditions water may also move against its activity gradient in the presence of a permeating solute. The significance of water movement against osmotic gradients during active solute transport is discussed. The gall bladder concentrates bile by reabsorbing sodium chloride and water in isotonic proportions. From in vitro studies on <b>fish</b> gall <b>bladder</b> the mechanis...|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to adapting locomotor behavior, controlling buoyancy effects {{is critical for}} aquatic survival since aquatic ecosystems vary greatly by depth.

By changing the amount of gas in these swim <b>bladders,</b> <b>fish</b> actively control their density.
