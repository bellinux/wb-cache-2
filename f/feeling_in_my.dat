500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Windy City Media Group, Stefani said [...] " [...] was so perfect for my story-for what I was <b>feeling</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own personal life-that I didn't even get it as a feminist anthem. I thought it was just about me! I was just feeling me." [...] After the release of [...] "Baby Don't Lie" [...] a month prior, [...] "Spark the Fire" [...] was released on December 1, 2014.|$|E
500|$|Asked in an {{interview}} if he ever worried about going broke, Keating responded, [...] "All the time, every day. I come into the office with this hollow <b>feeling</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> stomach lots of time.... You get trapped almost. You get too many responsibilities. It's a bellyfull to carry. It's risky. Dangerous. There's the possibility of failure with it every day and every night. But in a way, it's a challenge. It's invigorating. There isn't any point in not being a player – you're here.... It's not only the money. It's the disgrace, yourself, your manhood. I'm not sure I'd have a big problem with that. On the other hand I'm not sure I wouldn't." ...|$|E
500|$|Bilal {{recorded}} the song [...] "Butterfly" [...] with Robert Glasper, {{a friend of}} his since college who had played on each of his albums. Bilal had previously worked with Glasper on the latter's 2012 album Black Radio. For the song [...] "Back to Love", Bilal originally programmed the music's drums on his Logic, but decided to record them live after bringing in other musicians at Pine Studios in Philadelphia. While recording [...] "Astray", he persuaded his drummer to play in the parking lot and record him live, which he recalled in an interview for The Huffington Post: [...] "I just had this <b>feeling</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> head like, 'man, I want this shit to feel big!' And when I would park my car in the parking lot, the acoustics in there made you feel like was a Catholic church with all of the sounds echoing off of everything." ...|$|E

2500|$|Shortly after Clairmont had {{introduced}} Shelley to Byron, she met Edward John Trelawny, {{who was to}} play a major role in the short remaining lives of both poets. After Shelley's death, Trelawny sent her love letters from Florence pleading with her to marry him, but she was not interested. Still, she remained in contact with him the rest of her long life. Clairmont wrote to Mary Shelley: [...] "He [...] likes a turbid and troubled life; I a quiet one; he is full of fine feeling and has no principles; I am full of fine principles but never had a <b>feeling</b> (<b>in</b> <b>my</b> life)." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{being asked}} in a 1988 {{interview}} about whether his music is or was religiously influenced, Brian referred to the 1962-published A Toehold on Zen, {{and said that he}} believed that he possessed what is called a [...] "toehold", defined metaphorically as [...] "any small step which allows one to move toward a greater goal". He elaborated: [...] "I learned from that book and from people who had a toehold on... say somebody had a grasp on life, a good grasp—they {{ought to be able to}} transfer that over to another thing." [...] During the recording of Pet Sounds, Brian held prayer meetings, later reflecting that [...] "God was with us the whole time we were doing [...] album ... I could feel that <b>feeling</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> brain." [...] In 1966, he explained that he wanted to move into a white spiritual sound, and predicted that the rest of the music industry would follow suit.|$|E

60|$|You may easily {{imagine that}} I was much gratified by the offered communication, yet I could not endure {{that he should}} renew his grief by a recital of his misfortunes. I felt the {{greatest}} eagerness to hear the promised narrative, partly from curiosity and partly from {{a strong desire to}} ameliorate his fate if it were <b>in</b> <b>my</b> power. I expressed these <b>feelings</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> answer.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are next}} to myself. In the morning, the same shall be proclaimed on the quarter-deck; and, {{in the event}} of my death, unless I am deceived <b>in</b> <b>my</b> man, you will prove my successor. This may strike you as sudden confidence. It is so, in part, I must acknowledge; but our {{shipping}} lists cannot be opened, like those of the King, by beat of drum in the streets of the metropolis; and, then, am I no judge of the human heart, if my frank reliance on your faith does not, in itself, strengthen your good <b>feelings</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> favour." ...|$|R

5000|$|House of Tales is a German game {{development}} studio {{founded by}} Martin Ganteföhr and Tobias Schachte. Martin serves {{as both the}} writer and the creative director for the game. In a 2008 interview, Martin expresses his reasons for choosing such an intense topic (violence / psychology of aggression) as the theme for the game, [...] "I chose the topic because it interests me, and {{is at least as}} worth to dedicate a game to as War on Mars. You see, making games is a very personal process for me. I have many questions about life, and as long as somebody is willing to listen, I will try to convey <b>my</b> thoughts and <b>feelings</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> games." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Willingly," [...] {{replied the}} Count, [...] "for I see, even so far off, that the statue is bestowing a benediction, {{and there is}} a <b>feeling</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> heart that I may be {{permitted}} to share it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why so?" [...] I asked, amazed, {{yet somehow}} <b>feeling</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> heart I could trust him implicitly. [...] "Why should the {{knowledge}} of the true circumstances of the case make me more unhappy than I am at present?" ...|$|E
60|$|Rejoiced to {{find that}} no longer time had been lost, I galloped along contentedly, and in silence, though with a rather {{confused}} <b>feeling</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> brain, and a sensation of being possessed of six noses rolled into one.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes." [...] exclaimed the indefatigable shaper of cloth, with {{a species}} of sigh {{which might have been}} equally {{construed}} into an evidence of the fulness of his mental enjoyment, or of the excess of his bodily labours; [...] "yes, smarter sayings have seldom fallen from the lips of man, than such as the squire pour'd out this very day. When he spoke of the plains of father Abraham, and of the smoke and thunder of the battle, Pardon, it stirred up such stomachy <b>feelings</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> bosom, that I verily believe I could have had the heart to throw aside the thimble, and go forth myself, to seek glory in battling in the cause of the King." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very {{sensible}} distinctions, {{and such}} as {{are entitled to}} fair answers; at least the first. I do not call levity, amiability; nor mere constitutional gaiety. Some of the seemingly most light-hearted women I have ever known, have been anything but amiable. There must be an unusual absence of selfishness,--a person must live less for herself, than others--or rather, must find her own happiness in the happiness of those she loves, to make a truly amiable woman. Heart and principle are {{at the bottom of}} what is truly amiable; though temperament and disposition undoubtedly contribute. As for the whom, your own sister Grace is a truly amiable young woman. I never knew her do anything to hurt another's <b>feelings</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life." ...|$|R

60|$|I {{suppose that}} {{something}} of what I was <b>feeling</b> was reflected <b>in</b> <b>my</b> face. I had always considered myself {{a man of}} the world and I was interested enough <b>in</b> <b>my</b> fellows to enjoy mixing with all classes.|$|R
6000|$|... "That--assuming {{that such}} things really happen--would make a {{difference}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>feeling,</b> but none <b>in</b> <b>my</b> conduct.

6000|$|... "I {{went back}} to the hotel with the big book under my arm, and with very {{conflicting}} <b>feelings</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> breast. On the one hand, I was definitely engaged and had a hundred pounds <b>in</b> <b>my</b> pocket; on the other, the look of the offices, the absence of name on the wall, and other of the points which would strike a business man had left a bad impression as to the position of my employers. However, come what might, I had my money, so I settled down to my task. All Sunday I was kept hard at work, and yet by Monday I had only got as far as H. I went round to my employer, found him in the same dismantled kind of room, and was told to keep at it until Wednesday, and then come again. On Wednesday it was still unfinished, so I hammered away until Friday--that is, yesterday. Then I brought it round to Mr. Harry Pinner.|$|R

60|$|June 6.--I arose {{much better}} this morning, having taken some medicine, which has removed the strange and aching <b>feeling</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> back and breast.

60|$|Mrs. Reed soon rallied her spirits: {{she shook}} me most soundly, she boxed both my ears, {{and then left}} me without a word. Bessie {{supplied}} the hiatus by a homily of an hour's length, in which she proved beyond a doubt that I was the most wicked and abandoned child ever reared under a roof. I half believed her; for I felt indeed only bad <b>feelings</b> surging <b>in</b> <b>my</b> breast.|$|R
5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of May {{a report in the}} Sunday Correspondent stated that four candidates were under active consideration: Habgood, David Sheppard (Bishop of Liverpool), Colin James (Bishop of Winchester) and John Waine (Bishop of Chelmsford). Habgood declined to take up the automatic place he could have had on the Crown Appointments Commission, which would select the two names to be given to the Prime Minister. He was endorsed in a leader in The Times on 10 July 1990, On 25 July it was announced that the next Archbishop of Canterbury would be George Carey, the Bishop of Bath and Wells. Habgood described him as [...] "a good choice", adding that [...] "there is a little human bit in anybody that likes the top job, but that is a very small part <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>feelings.</b> <b>In</b> <b>my</b> heart of hearts I didn't really want the job.
