5000|$|Magnetic {{flux leakage}} (،TFI) is a {{magnetic}} method of nondestructive testing {{that is used}} to detect corrosion and pitting in steel structures, most commonly pipelines and storage tanks. The basic principle is that a powerful magnet is used to magnetize the steel. At areas where there is corrosion or missing metal, the magnetic field [...] "leaks" [...] from the steel. In an MFL tool, a magnetic detector is placed between the poles of the magnet to detect the leakage field. Analysts interpret the chart recording of the leakage field to identify damaged areas and to estimate the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> loss.|$|E

The core-metal coating interface of probes is corrugated what enhances photon-to-plasmon coupling. A strong evanescent field allows for reduction of aperture diameter, which together with skin <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> used for coating decide upon resolution.

A Bragg grating is recorded in the cores with UV light diffracted into + 1 st/ 1 st diffraction orders on a sinusoidal phase mask. Modulation of the refractive index is connected with different etch rates. Etching with the Turner method is made in aqueous solution of HF acid. A corrugated tapered fibre is then coated with aluminium in a special rotating holder. We present results of this novel multi step technology...|$|E
40|$|Potential drop {{techniques}} are of two types: the direct current potential drop (DCPD) technique and alternating current potential drop (ACPD) technique, {{and both of}} them are used in nondestructive testing. ACPD, as a kind of valid method in sizing metal cracks, has been applied to evaluate metal structures. However, our review of most available approaches revealed that some improvements can be done in measuring <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> bottom crack by means of ACPD, such as accuracy and sensitivity of shallow crack. This paper studied a novel method which utilized the slope of voltage ratio-frequency curve to solve bottom crack depth by using a simple mathematic equation based on finite element analysis. It is found that voltage ratio varies linearly with frequency in the range of 5 - 15 Hz; this range is slightly higher than the equivalent frequency and lower than semi-permeable frequency. Simulation and experiment show that the novel method can measure the bottom crack depth accurately...|$|E

40|$|There is now {{growing concern}} {{regarding}} {{the safety of}} many prestressed concrete structures [1]. Of primary importance is {{the condition of the}} reinforcing steel, and much research effort has been expended on the development of non-destructive systems for assessing the integrity of internal reinforcing components [2 – 5]. Concrete is notoriously difficult to inspect, and most civil engineers, when assessing the quality of the internal reinforcing steel, will resort to a battery of tests, since a single test in isolation will rarely provide sufficient information. The system described below is a novel re-bar imaging system, based on an inductive principle, which should eliminate the need for many ancillary tests once fully developed [6]. A sensor which responds to the area and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> in its sensing region is scanned across the concrete under inspection by a system linked to a computer. The signals acquired are stored, processed and displayed as grey level images. The initial images are blurred, due to the point spread function (PSF) of the sensor. These images have been significantly enhanced using a form of processing termed digital deconvolution. This form of processing allows considerable improvements in image quality to be realized from a single scan if the PSF of the sensor is known. In this instance, the PSF has been obtained through the development of an empirical model...|$|E

After a mechanical and electrochemical polish, samples of the 50 x 5 x 1 mm dimensions was exposed by vacuum annealing during 120 min at temperature 700 °C with following slow cooling.
