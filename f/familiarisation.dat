5|$|Air Marshal Murdoch led the RAAF {{through the}} {{build-up}} of Australia's {{commitment to the}} Vietnam War beginning in the mid-1960s. He clashed with the Chief of the General Staff (CGS), Lieutenant General Sir John Wilton, over the latter's recommendation in mid-1965 to deploy two UH-1 Iroquois helicopters to Vietnam. Wilton believed that both services would benefit from gaining <b>familiarisation</b> with air/ground operations in the region before large-scale commitment of Australian forces. Murdoch dismissed the idea on resourcing grounds, {{despite the fact that}} two-thirds of the RAAF's UH-1 complement had been purchased {{for the express purpose of}} army cooperation.|$|E
5|$|Amidst growing {{concerns}} amongst Australian {{military commanders}} about Japanese intentions, the scheduled {{replacement of the}} 22nd Brigade was cancelled, and the 2/18th remained in Seremban until they were transported east to Jemaluang in August. The following month they were sent north to Mersing, which, situated {{on the east coast}} of the Malay Peninsula, was considered a likely place for a Japanese landing as it offered a short route of advance towards Singapore. At Mersing, the battalion was set to work digging defensive positions and constructing wire obstacles, punctuated by <b>familiarisation</b> patrols and anti-aircraft, anti-gas and mortar training.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, three {{production}} Su-27Ms {{were delivered}} to the air force's 929th State Flight-Test Centre (GLITs) at , Akhtubinsk, to perform weapons trials. In 2001, the air force decided to transfer several Su-27Ms to re-equip the Russian Knights aerobatics team, and so the team's pilots took <b>familiarisation</b> flights with the aircraft. The three production and two other pre-production Su-27Ms arrived at the team's Kubinka air base near Moscow in 2003. However, they were used {{as a source of}} spare parts for other aircraft in the demonstration fleet.|$|E
5|$|While {{they were}} training, the Allies {{launched}} the August Offensive {{in an attempt}} to break the deadlock that had developed on the Gallipoli Peninsula following the initial landing. The offensive largely failed and heavy casualties resulted. In order to replace the men that were lost and give the survivors a rest, the decision was made by Allied commanders to move the 2nd Division from Egypt. After being moved to Lemnos Island, the 23rd Battalion embarked for Gallipoli on 4 September, arriving there at 9:30pm that evening. A day of <b>familiarisation</b> followed before the battalion took up defensive positions at Lone Pine. On 12 September, the 23rd, along with their sister battalion, the 24th, took over responsibility for the post from the 1st Division battalions that had held it previously. During the stalemate that followed, manning positions that, in some places, were only a few metres from the Ottoman lines, the 23rd Battalion began countermining operations after Turkish mining operations were discovered. For the next three months, due to the intensity of the fighting in the sector, the battalion alternated their position with the 24th Battalion almost every day until the evacuation of Allied troops from the peninsula occurred, embarking with the last troops to leave on the night of 19/20 December 1915.|$|E

For the skill to be reliable in an emergency, periodic reinforcement is necessary, and <b>familiarisation</b> is particularly valuable when buddies are to dive together for the first time.|$|E
25|$|No. 31 Squadron {{was formed}} at RAAF Base Wagga on 14 August 1942 and was {{equipped}} with Bristol Beaufighter fighter and attack aircraft, {{the first of which}} was received on 23 August 1942. Under the command of Squadron Leader Charles Frederick Read, who later went on to serve as Chief of the Air Staff, the squadron undertook a period of training before deploying to Batchelor Airfield, Northern Territory, in October, the aircraft flying via Alice Springs. A period of more intense training followed and <b>familiarisation</b> flights were carried out before moving to its operational base at Coomalie Creek Airfield on 12 November and then began flying combat operations on 17 November, attacking targets in Portuguese Timor.|$|E
25|$|During 1938, the RAF {{had begun}} to receive its first {{deliveries}} of the Hurricane and Spitfire monoplanes; an emphasis was soon placed on quickly reequipping half of the Gladiator squadrons with either of these monoplane types. By {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War, the Gladiator had largely been replaced by the Hurricane and Spitfire in frontline RAF service. The introduction of these aircraft had been eased by the presence of the Gladiator, squadrons that had operated Gladiators prior to converting to the monoplane types experienced a noticeably improved accident record than those who converted from older types such as the Gauntlet. Experiences such as operating the Gladiator's landing flaps and <b>familiarisation</b> with its sliding hood have been attributed as having favourably impacted pilot conversion.|$|E
25|$|In March 1942, the Lieutenant Colonel Ronald Hone {{took over}} {{command of the}} regiment, which was also {{expanded}} to three batteries with the raising of the 64th Battery. In January 1943, the regiment moved to Loftus, New South Wales, handing over its garrison duties to the 2/11th Field Regiment. Following the 2/14th's arrival in Loftus in February, a period of leave followed, after which the regiment was re-equipped with the Ordnance QF 25-pounder gun and later throughout the year the regiment undertook <b>familiarisation</b> training, building towards two regimental exercises in June and July around Illawarra, New South Wales. Later, in September the regiment was re-organised in sympathy with the newly formulated Australian Army jungle establishment, which resulted in it being issued 81 jeeps and 63 four-wheel drive vehicles. The following month, the regiment moved north to Kalinga, Queensland, to prepare for embarkation overseas.|$|E
25|$|No. 13 Squadron {{was formed}} from {{elements}} of No. 12 Squadron at RAAF Base Darwin on 1 June 1940. Its first commanding officer was Wing Commander John Balmer. The squadron initially operated Avro Ansons, {{serving in the}} general reconnaissance role and flew maritime surveillance patrols over the seas {{to the north of}} Australia and survey flights over northern Australia. The squadron was re-equipped with Lockheed Hudson light bombers, suffering its first loss in September when one aircraft was destroyed on take-off. In early 1941, the squadron was tasked with locating a German commerce raider and a U-boat, before joining the search for survivors from HMAS Sydney following its battle with the German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran. In May 1941, the squadron began flying <b>familiarisation</b> flights over the Netherlands East Indies in preparation to deploy to the NEI following the outbreak of war with Japan.|$|E
25|$|A1 Grands Prix of Nations {{took place}} over a three-day period, from Friday to Sunday. The teams were given five sets of dry weather slick tires, and two sets of wet weather treaded tires per weekend. However, if the weather was extreme, the team could be given more wet weather tires {{at the expense of}} the slick tires. The race weekend started with two one-hour {{practice}} sessions held on the Friday, and then another on the Saturday morning. A two-hour qualifying session took place on Saturday afternoon, and two races took place on Sunday. Primarily, the three practice sessions were for car setup and track <b>familiarisation</b> before the official competition began with Saturday qualifying. Three different drivers could participate in the three practice sessions; the driver elected for qualifying or for one of the races was required to have taken part in at least one such practice session.|$|E
25|$|On 14 February, {{the inquiry}} was reopened to hear new evidence. The final report into the {{accident}} was published on 7 May. It was established {{that there was nothing}} mechanically wrong with the aircraft at the time it crashed, although the engines were operating at idle power. A number of issues were raised, including the rostering of the crew, the captain's failure to ensure that he had all necessary navigational information, the captain's decision to divert to Le Bourget instead of returning straight to England, the inability of Cormeilles to handle two aircraft at once, and the captain's decision to return to England being made too late. Five recommendations were made {{as a result of the}} investigation. These were in relation to crewing, crew route <b>familiarisation,</b> provision of route information to crews, the ability of airfields to handle more than one aircraft at a time by radio and the introduction of new systems of working between the United Kingdom and France in respect of the control of air traffic and the hand-over of flights between the two countries. The latter was reported as already being under consideration at the time the report was published.|$|E

500|$|On arrival, Waldmann was {{approached}} by Hauptmann (Captain) Johannes Steinhoff and asked whether {{he would like to}} fly as his wingman. Waldmann then conducted six <b>familiarisation</b> flights on the [...] "Gustav", as the Bf-109G-2 was referred to, on 30 August 1942. Flying a Bf-109 marked with a black [...] "Chevron-2", indicating an aircraft of the Stab, he flew his first combat mission on 31 August 1942 in the vicinity of Stalingrad. Steinhoff was impressed by his first performance. At the time, Waldmann was still officially assigned to a transfer squadron, but Steinhoff decided to keep him in his Stabs-Schwarm, flight of four. Here his comrades nicknamed Waldmann [...] "Dackel", an allusion to his last name. In German, a [...] "Dackel", or Dachshund, is often named Waldi, a hypocoristic form of Waldmann.|$|E
500|$|After {{their escape}} from Crete, the 28th (Māori) Battalion was {{evacuated}} to Egypt {{where they were}} re-issued with summer uniforms and began to receive reinforcements. In June they carried out a ceremonial parade for King George VI and the Queen, and {{the commander of the}} 2nd New Zealand Division, Lieutenant General Bernard Freyberg. Throughout July, the battalion undertook desert <b>familiarisation</b> training and sports parades before moving to Kabrit where they concentrated {{with the rest of the}} 5th Infantry Brigade for a three-week combined operations exercise. Later, in August, they moved to a position [...] west of El Alamein, known as the [...] "Kaponga Box" [...] where throughout September and into October they undertook the unfamiliar task of road construction.

500|$|On 2 November 1960, the Ministry of Supply {{issued a}} {{contract}} for a further four prototypes to be produced, which were intended to develop the aircraft further towards being a realistic combat design, such as the refinement of the wing, engine improvements, and of accompanying operational equipment. Throughout this period, improved models of the Pegasus engine were rapidly developed, such as the Pegasus 3 being capable of 15,000lbf (67kN) of thrust. Apart from the improved powerplants, the first four P.1127 prototypes were quite similar; the fifth prototype, XP980, introduced the taller fin and tailplane anhedral which were later used on the production Harrier. The fourth machine was partially used to provide Hawker production test pilots with type <b>familiarisation.</b> [...] The first carrier vertical landing was performed by the first prototype on [...] in 1963. The last P.1127, XP984, introduced the swept wing. It was eventually fitted with the 15,000lbf (66.7kN) Pegasus 5 and functioned as the prototype Kestrel.|$|E
500|$|By mid-1964, Australia {{had already}} sent a small team of {{military}} advisors, {{as well as}} a flight of newly acquired DHC-4 Caribou transports, to aid the South Vietnamese government in its fight against the Viet Cong. [...] The 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, was deployed in May 1965. It was attached to a USArmy brigade, and Wilton was responsible for setting its operational parameters. In August, he recommended to his opposite number in the RAAF, Air Marshal Alister Murdoch, the despatch of two UH-1 Iroquois helicopters to Vietnam. Wilton believed that both services would benefit from gaining <b>familiarisation</b> with air/ground operations in the region before any large-scale commitment of Australian forces. He was exasperated when Murdoch rejected the idea on resourcing grounds, despite the fact that two-thirds of the RAAF's UH-1 complement had been purchased {{for the express purpose of}} army cooperation. According to the official history of the post-war Air Force, when the Federal government deployed No.9 Squadron and its UH-1s to Vietnam less than a year later, the unit was under-prepared for combat operations.|$|E

During a <b>familiarisation</b> flight he came under friendly fire from anti-aircraft guns on Kiriwina Island, but avoided serious injury. He was raised to temporary group captain in December, and assumed command of No.71 Wing the following month. The Beauforts of No.6 Squadron and No.71 Wing {{took part in a}} series of major attacks on Rabaul, bombing and strafing airfields, infrastructure and shipping; this continued until February 1944, when the Japanese withdrew their aircraft from Rabaul. [...] The same month, Hannah fell ill and had to be repatriated to Australia. After six weeks recuperation at Laverton, he returned to No.6 Squadron, based on Goodenough Island. From March to August, the squadron was mainly involved in convoy escort and anti-submarine duties.

The HZL formed part of the German Luftwaffe; its members swore an oath of loyalty to Adolf Hitler, were subject to German disciplinary regulations and wore Luftwaffe uniforms. After attending Luftwaffe training schools, the fighter group {{was sent to the}} Eastern Front and designated as 15. (Kroatische) Staffel (squadron) of III. Gruppe (Group) of Jagdgeschwader 52 (52nd Fighter Wing, or JG 52). Meanwhile, Dukovac was transferred to the Luftwaffe Flugzeugführerschüle A/B 120 (pilot school 120) in Prenzlau, Germany in September or October. In April 1942 he underwent advanced training, and in June he was transferred to Jagdfliegerschüle 4 (fighter pilot school 4) at Fürth. In October 1942, Leutnant Dukovac and seven other pilots joined 15./JG 52, which was operating in the Caucasus flying Messerschmitt Bf 109G-2 fighters.

He was {{appointed}} a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) [...] "in recognition of distinguished {{service in the}} Borneo Territories" [...] on 22June. His tenure as DCAS coincided with the most significant rearmament program the Air Force had undertaken since World WarII, and with manpower shortages stemming from this expansion and from Australia's increasing involvement in the security of South East Asia. The first RAAF helicopters were committed to the Vietnam War {{towards the end of}} his term, and he travelled to Saigon with the Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Sir John Wilton, in March 1966 to plan the deployment. The year before, Wilton had recommended to Air Marshal Murdoch, the Chief of the Air Staff, that two Iroquois be sent to Vietnam for <b>familiarisation</b> purposes; Murdoch had rebuffed Wilton, and the RAAF helicopter squadron was considered underprepared for its army co-operation role when it finally did deploy. Headlam succeeded Air Vice Marshal Douglas Candy as AOC Support Command, Melbourne, on 8August 1966.

Upon completion, Waldmann {{was transferred to the}} Flugzeugführerschule A/B 72 (flight school for the pilot license) at Markersdorf near Sankt Pölten in early October 1940. Eight days later his training group returned to Fels am Wagram because Markersdorf was overcrowded with other flight courses. Thus flight training started on the improvised airfield without hangars at Fels am Wagram. His first <b>familiarisation</b> flight was on 16 October 1940, in a Bücker Bü 131 [...] "Jungmann" [...] biplane marked [...] "VTAF". Waldmann logged his first solo flight on 13 November 1940 at 09:17 in a Bü 131 [...] "CGNL", landing again after six minutes of flight time.
