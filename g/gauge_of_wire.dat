40|$|Background: This study {{aimed to}} compare the {{mechanical}} properties between four groups of newly fabricated combination wires according to their method of union, according to the <b>gauges</b> <b>of</b> <b>wires</b> and a comparison were made between them and their originals. Materials and method: A total of 60 stainless steel combination wires were fabricated, divided into four groups according to <b>gauge</b> <b>of</b> <b>wires</b> and their method of union, each of them with 15 samples, the groups were welded (0. 016 x 0. 022 - 0. 016 and 0. 016 x 0. 022 - 0. 018) and soldered (0. 016 x 0. 022 - 0. 016 and 0. 016 x 0. 022 - 0. 018), samples were made according to certain parameters which were: for the welded samples: length,weight, duration of pulsation and size of copper electrode tips used; for the soldered samples: length, weight, distaince from the heat source and duration of heat application Results: The descriptive statistics showed that the maximum value for ultimate force and ultimate tensile strength was for the soldered 0. 016 x 0. 022 + 0. 018 inches combination wires, while the minimum was for the welded 0. 016 x 0. 022 + 0. 016 inches wires.

30|$|Cu and Zn {{are among}} the most toxic metals {{affecting}} the environment. The primary sources of Cu in industrial wastewater are metal-process pickling baths and plating baths. Cu may also be present in wastewater from a variety of chemical manufacturing processes employing Cu salts or a Cu catalyst (Eckenfelder 2000). Many studies have shown that these metals are toxic even at very low concentrations. However, these metals have many applications in the industry. For example, Cu is known as an excellent conductor of electricity, widely used in the electrical industry in all <b>gauges</b> <b>of</b> <b>wires</b> for circuitry. Cu is also utilized in analytical reagents, in paints for ship keels and in electroplating. Cu acts as an irritant to the skin causing itching and dermatitis, and may cause keratinization of the hands and soles of the feet (Sitting 1981). Zn is often found in effluents discharged from industries involved in acid mine drainage, galvanizing plants, natural ores and municipal wastewater treatment plants and is not biodegradable and travels through the food chain via bioaccumulation (King et al. 2008). Therefore, a systematic study of the removal of Cu and Zn from wastewater is of considerable significance from an environmental point of view.|$|R

Copper wire provides an easily manufactured, general purpose voice coil, at a reasonable cost.

While rather delicate in a manufacturing environment, aluminium wire has about {{one third of the}} mass <b>of</b> the equivalent <b>gauge</b> <b>of</b> copper <b>wire,</b> and has about two-thirds of the electrical conductivity. Copper-clad aluminium wire is occasionally used, allowing easier winding, along with a useful reduction in coil mass compared to copper.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{research in}} the area of solenoid modelling and design. It is anticipated that the model described will contribute to the design of solenoids for operation in an intrinsically safe environment Firstly, the requirements for intrinsic safety are described including an overview of the complete system. The relevant standards to be applied are highlighted and the optimum power rating for a solenoid working in an intrinsically safe system is derived. The mathematical model is then described together with the assumptions made. The model is able to determine the most efficient <b>gauge</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> to use for a given solenoid resistance from the dimensions of a solenoid coil former, and from this data calculate the expected force generated by the solenoid. The basis of the model is the probable flux path method of solenoid analysis. The method for verifying the model are then discussed as well as a complete analysis of an existing intrinsically safe solenoids. The purpose for the analysis of an existing solenoid was undertaken so that a set of solenoid design rules may be established. The design rules will enable the user to design for the exact requirements for the pneumatic comppnents based on the solenoid operating pressure. Finally, methods for reducing the manufacturing time and improving the assembly time of the solenoid are presented...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} simple semi-analytical method for {{designing}} coil-systems for homogeneous magnetostatic field generation. The homogeneity {{of the magnetic}} field and the average magnitude of the magnetic flux density inside {{of the volume of}} interest are the objective functions chosen for the selection of the coil-system geometry (size and location), number of coils and the number of turns of each winding. The spatial distribution of the magnetostatic field is estimated superposing the magnetic induction numerically computed from the analytical expression of the magnetic field generated by each coil, obtained using the Biot-Savart’s law and the current filament method. The homogeneous magnetic field is synthesized using an iterative algorithm based on TABU search with geometric constraints, which varies the design parameters of the windings to meet the requirements. The number of turns of each coil and <b>gauge</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> used for the windings is adjusted automatically in order to achieve the target average magnitude of the magnetic induction under the constraints imposed by power consumption. This method was used to design a coil arrangement that can generate up to 10 mT within a volume 0. 5 m× 0. 5 m× 1 m with 99 % of spatial homogeneity, with square loops of length {{less than or equal to}} 1. 5 m, and with a power dissipated by Joule effect less than or equal to 1 W per coil. The synthesized magnetic field distribution was validated using Finite Element Method simulation, showing a good correspondence between the objective values and the simulated fields. This method is an alternative to design magnetic field exposure systems over large volumes such as those used in bioelectromagnetics applications...|$|E
2500|$|It is {{difficult}} to determine what metal the strings of Cristofori's pianos were made of, since strings are replaced as they break, and sometimes restorers even replace the entire set of strings. According to Stewart Pollens, [...] "the earlier museum records document that all three [...] Cristofori pianos were discovered with similar <b>gauges</b> <b>of</b> iron <b>wire</b> through much <b>of</b> the compass, and brass in the bass." [...] The New York instrument was restrung entirely in brass in 1970; Pollens reports that with this modification the instrument cannot be tuned closer than a minor third below pitch without breaking strings. This may indicate that the original strings did indeed include iron ones; however, the breakage might also be blamed on the massive rebuilding of this instrument, which changed its tonal range.|$|R
