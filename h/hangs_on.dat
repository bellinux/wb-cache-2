5|$|Athenian {{girls were}} not {{formally}} educated; instead, their mothers taught them the domestic {{skills necessary for}} running a household. Formal education for boys consisted of rhetoric, necessary for effective political participation, and physical education in preparation for military service. These skills were not considered necessary for women, who were barred from learning them. Classical art indicates that girls and boys played with toys such as spinning tops, hoops, and seesaws, and played games such as piggyback. The gravestone of Plangon, an Athenian girl aged about five {{which is in the}} Glyptothek museum in Munich, shows her holding a doll; a set of knucklebones <b>hangs</b> <b>on</b> a wall in the background.|$|E
5|$|The {{portrait}} {{represents a}} man, estimated {{by some to}} be 45years of age, standing turned to the viewer's right, looking at the viewer with a commanding expression. In his uplifted right hand he holds a baton with a golden cap. He has a thick moustache and wears a high fur cap on which there is a golden chain with precious stones and a coat of arms in the center. From his ear a large pear-shaped pearl hangs from a golden pendant earring. He wears a reddish-brown mantle with a broad fur collar and, over it, a heavy gold chain from which the order of three horse tails, set in rich pendants, <b>hangs</b> <b>on</b> his right shoulder. A full light from the left falls {{on the right side of}} his face. The background is brownish-grey.|$|E
5|$|Further {{depictions of}} Mary {{are found in}} the church background. They include a statue of the Virgin and Child {{positioned}} between two lit candles in the choir screen behind the main figures, and to the right two angels stand in the choir singing her praises (perhaps singing the hymn inscribed on the frame). Above her is an annunciation relief, and in the recessed bay a relief depicting her coronation; the crucifixion is shown on the rood. Thus, the stages of Mary's life as mother of Jesus are depicted in the painting. A two-column prayer tablet – similar to the one depicted in Rogier van der Weyden's large Seven Sacraments Altarpiece (1445–50) – <b>hangs</b> <b>on</b> a pier to the left. It contains words alluding to and echoing the lines on the original frame. The windows of the clerestory overlook flying buttresses, and cobwebs are visible between the arches of the vault. Several different building phases {{can be seen in the}} arched gallery, while the choral balcony and transept are depicted in a more contemporary style than the nave.|$|E

60|$|This {{is plain}} scripture, {{and the man}} Christ Jesus (sayest thou) <b>hanged</b> <b>on</b> the cross on Mount Calvary: because, they wickedly judged {{him to be a}} blasphemer, and through their envy persecuted him to death; because he bare witness against them, and as in their account he died, and <b>hanged</b> <b>on</b> the cross, for an evil doer. And this is one ground (at least) why he <b>hanged</b> <b>on</b> the cross, &c.|$|R

25|$|On 14 May 1796, Jenner tested his {{hypothesis}} by inoculating James Phipps, {{an eight-year-old}} {{boy who was}} the son of Jenner's gardener. He scraped pus from cowpox blisters on the hands of Sarah Nelmes, a milkmaid who had caught cowpox from a cow called Blossom, whose hide now <b>hangs</b> <b>on</b> the wall of the St George's medical school library (now in Tooting). Phipps was the 17th case described in Jenner's first paper on vaccination.|$|E
25|$|A {{wide range}} of other devotional {{practices}} can be found among Catholics. An example {{is the use of}} a Home Altar. This practice dates back to the early Christians who used to pray in their homes even before churches were built for public worship. In a Home Altar, a cross usually <b>hangs</b> <b>on</b> the wall, and images of Jesus, the Blessed Virgin and saints may be displayed, along with a copy of the Bible or other devotional literature.|$|E

25|$|LeChuck's Revenge {{is set in}} the fictitious Tri-Island Area of the Caribbean, {{several months}} after The Secret of Monkey Island. The game opens in medias res as Guybrush Threepwood <b>hangs</b> <b>on</b> a rope above a hole, narrating to Elaine Marley on a {{separate}} rope the events that led to this situation. The flashback sequence starts on Scabb Island and constitutes most of the playable game's setting. During it, Guybrush also visits Phatt Island, Booty Island, and Dinky Island, voyaging on two different pirate ships.|$|E
25|$|The {{alternative}} is to donate the primary demand valve that the donor is currently breathing from, {{on the principle that}} it is known to be working and is immediately recognizable and accessible. The donor, who should be less stressed, will then switch to the secondary demand valve, which in this arrangement is generally mounted on a loop of bungee cord which <b>hangs</b> <b>on</b> the neck, and keeps the secondary demand valve tucked up under the diver's chin, where it can often be reached without the use of the hands, by bending the head forward and gripping the mouthpiece with the teeth.|$|E
25|$|The {{shaft of}} the central cross is covered in small lumps {{as was the case}} with all votive crosses erected to {{celebrate}} the end of an outbreak of the plague. These are thought by some architectural historians to mimick the boil like sores which were one of the symptoms of the bubonic plague. Dismas, the good thief, hangs from a cross to the right of Jesus and an angel stands near his right shoulder ready to carry off his soul. The bad thief <b>hangs</b> <b>on</b> the cross to Jesus' left and in his case it is the devil who will carry off his soul. Both the angel and the devil clutch small doll like sculptures no doubt depictions of the souls they will eventually carry off.|$|E
