30|$|Figure  2 b {{shows the}} (i) <b>EDX</b> <b>spectrum</b> of the {{selectively}} grown ZnO NRs on the active channel and their corresponding (ii) zinc (Zn), (iii) oxygen (O), and (iv) silicon (Si) elemental mapping images. From the <b>EDX</b> <b>spectrum,</b> {{the amounts of}} zinc and oxygen atoms were quantified to be ~ 14.3 and 20.5  %, respectively, indicating a 1 : 1 ratio of Zn and O for ZnO NRs. The amount of oxygen atoms was a little {{higher than that of}} zinc atoms because the oxygen in SiO 2 layer on Si substrate was also counted. The elemental mapping images exhibited that the zinc and oxygen atoms found at high concentrations were uniformly distributed over the active channel region while the silicon was rarely observed. This indicates that the ZnO NRs were densely grown on the active channel without any significant defects or vacancies.|$|E
30|$|EDX {{results from}} hollow spheres {{showed that it}} was mainly {{composed}} of Zn, Fe, and O (Fig.  2 d). Quantification of the <b>EDX</b> <b>spectrum</b> showed that the ratio of Zn, Fe, and O was about 1 : 2 : 4, suggesting that the porous hollow spheres had a chemical formula of ZnFe 2 O 4.|$|E
40|$|The {{quantitative}} composition of metal alloy nanowires on InSb semiconductor surface and gold nanostructures on germanium surface {{is determined by}} blind source separation (BSS) machine learning method using non-negative matrix factorization from energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (<b>EDX)</b> <b>spectrum</b> image maps measured in a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The BSS method blindly decomposes the collected <b>EDX</b> <b>spectrum</b> image into three source components, which correspond directly to the X-ray signals coming from the supported metal nanostructures, bulk semiconductor signal, and carbon background. The recovered {{quantitative composition}} is validated by detailed Monte Carlo simulations and is confirmed by separate cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy EDX measurements of the nanostructures. This shows that simple and achievable SEM EDX measurements together with machine learning non-negative matrix factorization-based blind source separation processing could be successfully used for the nanostructures quantitative chemical composition determination. Our finding can make the chemical quantification at the nanoscale much faster and cost efficient for many systems...|$|E

30|$|For energy {{dispersive}} X-ray analysis, {{the samples were}} studied by field emission gun-based scanning electron microscope with {{energy dispersive}} X-ray analysis (SEM/EDX) (Quanta model by FEI Co., the Netherlands) for the morphological {{as well as for}} the presence of elemental information on the samples. The SEM studies were performed at 30  kV in the low vacuum mode. <b>EDX</b> <b>spectra</b> were taken from the area corresponding to the SEM image shown in the in-set.

30|$|Scanning {{electron}} microscopy (SEM) was performed using a Tescan Mira 3 LMU microscope with an accelerating voltage of 5 – 20  kV. Energy-dispersive X-ray (<b>EDX)</b> <b>spectra</b> were taken using a built-in Oxford X-max 80  mm 2 setup.|$|R
30|$|EDX {{measurements}} {{were performed to}} check the elemental compositions and uniformity in elemental distribution of Ag film deposited on Si substrate. Representative <b>EDX</b> <b>spectrum</b> recorded on 30  nm pristine films is shown as Fig.  2 ii. As shown in spectrum, except the peak of Si (from the substrate), {{there is only one}} significant absorption peak of Ag. The peak around 0.1  keV energy in <b>EDX</b> <b>spectrum</b> is due to lighter elements like oxygen. FESEM images of pristine Ag thin films with of 10, 20, and 30  nm thickness were recorded at 25  keV electron beam energy, as shown in the micrographs (iii), (iv) and (v), respectively, in Fig.  2. FESEM results show that Ag particles are uniformly distributed on the Si substrate and surfaces of pristine Ag thin films are found to be densely packed. Surface features of around 3 – 5  nm in diameter are observed in all pristine samples of different thicknesses, which can be attributed to nanocrystallite-induced roughness on the surface. The density of the nanocrystallites and size of these surface features are found to slightly increase with thickness increase.|$|E
40|$|A {{study on}} the {{formation}} of ZnO nanostructures using the carbothermal evaporation method without catalyst and at atmospheric argon pressure has been conducted.

The results of these parametric studies based on field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (<b>EDX)</b> <b>spectrum</b> and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses support the reduction-evaporation model for ZnO nanostructures formation using carbothermal evaporation...|$|E
30|$|SEM {{analysis}} of the synthesized silver nanoparticles was done using a Hitachi S- 4500 SEM machine (Japan). A thin layer of gold was used to coat the samples through vacuum evaporation so that the nanoparticles conducts evenly and provides a homogeneous surface for analysis and imaging on an aluminium slab. The elemental analysis was performed using EDX (JEOL-JSM- 5800 LV, Tokyo, Japan) which is an attachment to the SEM.

Samples were prepared by spotting 5 μL of the desired particle-containing solution onto a glass slide, drying under vacuum, and then repeating the spot/dry three times to produce samples with enough thickness to prevent interference from the glass slide during EDX analysis. Samples were then coated with Au (2 - 5 nm thickness) using a Cressington 108 Manual Sputter Coater (Ted Pella, Redding, CA, USA).

A solid bronze layer was not applied. The top thin layer on the absolute surface of this covering was made of copper arsenic. Pigments contained copper and arsenic, Sheele’s green and Emerald green and have a general green colour [4]. Obviously, this layer was applied for imitation of patina.|$|E

30|$|In the {{presence}} of PEIMPA inhibitor, the <b>EDX</b> <b>spectra</b> show additional lines of nitrogen and phosphorus, due to the adsorbed layer of inhibitor that covered the electrode surface. In addition, the Fe peaks are decreasing {{in relation to the}} uninhibited steel surface sample. This diminution of the Fe lines occurs because of the overlying inhibitor film.|$|R

30|$|Energy-dispersive X-ray {{analysis}} (EDX) {{was carried}} out to investigate the purity and the chemical composition of the as-synthesized ZnO nanopencils. The <b>EDX</b> <b>spectrum</b> is shown in Fig.  1. The energy peak at 0.525  keV corresponds to oxygen (K line) and peaks at 0.906, 1.102  keV corresponds to zinc (L line), while as 8.630 and 9.578  keV correspond to zinc (K line). From the EDX analysis, {{it is clear that}} the chemical composition is purely zinc (Zn) and oxygen (O), with no other impurity contents.

The differences in SEM image of (a) bagasse, (b) its biochar and (c) Pb 2 +-loaded biochar could be clearly visualized. Before charring the surface was uniform and very smooth, and after thermal treatment, it became comparatively rough and irregular increasing the surface area. After adsorption, the space became filled with some irregular, crystalline structures which supported the adsorption of Pb 2 + from the effluent. In addition to this, existence of Pb 2 + in the <b>EDX</b> <b>spectrum</b> may aslo be considered in the support successful adsorption of the metal (Fig.  2 d, e).|$|E

40|$|Published online: 27 February 2012 The {{possibility}} of {{scanning electron microscope}} (SEM) observation and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometry analysis in microscale regions of insulating samples using diluted ionic liquid was investigated. It is possible to obtain clear secondary electron images of insulating samples such as a rock and mineral at 5, 000 times magnification by dropping 10 μL of 1 wt% of 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium acetate (EMI-CH 3 COO) diluted with ethanol onto the samples. We also obtained <b>EDX</b> <b>spectra</b> of the samples in microscale regions (∼ 5 μm 2) without overlapping <b>EDX</b> <b>spectra</b> of other minerals with different composition. It {{might be possible to}} perform quantitative analysis of the samples if a method that does not need standard samples is applied or an X-ray detector sensitive for light elements was attached. The method of dropping 1 wt% EMI-CH 3 COO diluted with ethanol onto insulating samples is useful for SEM observation, EDX analysis in microscale regions, and the preservation of scarce rock and mineral samples because ionic liquid can be easily removed with acetone...|$|R
30|$|The {{following}} <b>EDX</b> <b>spectra</b> of the unloaded {{and loaded}} composite were collected and shown in Fig.  13 a–d. The attendances of iron, manganese and oxygen on the unloaded composite surface, and iron, manganese and oxygen, arsenic on the loaded composite surface were exposed clearly.

40|$|A rocking-beam energy-dispersive X-ray (<b>EDX)</b> <b>spectrum</b> {{image was}} {{acquired}} near the [035] zone axis of a B 2 -ordered alloy of composition Ni{sub 50 }Al{sub 40 }Fe{sub 10 }. Images {{comparable to those}} acquired by Rossouw et al. were formed a posteriori by integrating the X-ray intensities in windows enclosing the Al-K, Fe-K{sub {alpha}}, and Ni-K{sub {alpha}} characteristic X-ray peaks for each pixel of the spectrum image. These images are shown along with a bright-field transmission channeling pattern (TCP), which records the signal from the bright-field STEM detector as the incident beam direction is varied with the beam-tilt coils, and an <b>EDX</b> <b>spectrum</b> from one pixel of the image. The range of orientations from which the spectrum image was acquired is indicated by the square superimposed on the TCP. ALCHEMI (atom-location by channeling-enhanced microanalysis) was performed on {{a subset of the}} spectrum image using standard methods. Spectra from a series of {approximately} 30 pixels along lines parallel to the (200) band were summed at each of 31 orientations relative to the band in the range 0 {le} {theta}/{theta}{sub 200 } {le} 2. 3. Characteristic X-ray intensities of the K-shell X-rays of Ni, Fe, and Al were extracted from the 31 summed spectra with the simplex fitting procedure of the DTSA spectral analysis software.

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  8 b, c, MZNCs are cubic in shape with the {{appearance}} of MNPs on the surface of zeolite NPs. The <b>EDX</b> <b>spectrum</b> of MZNCs shows that peaks at 0.55, 1.05, 1.50 and 1.75  keV are related to the binding energies of O, Na, Al and Si, respectively, which confirm the composition of zeolite plus peaks in regions of 6.4 and 7.05  keV, which are related to the binding energies of Fe. This confirms that the zeolite structure has not changed by synthesis of MZNCs. Moreover, the appearance of peaks in regions of Fe indicates the presence of iron in the products, well as incorporation of magnetic particles with high ratios into the prepared composite by our procedures of preparation.|$|E
