The first such aid was a sip-and-puff typewriter controller named the patient-operated selector mechanism (POSSUM) prototyped by Reg Maling in the United Kingdom in 1960.

Although it was commercially unsuccessful, the LOT was well received by its users.|$|E
25|$|What was not {{apparent}} {{from the western}} side however, was that East Berlin's construction boasted its own <b>illuminated</b> <b>display</b> board facing east, whose messages comprised the version of {{the news that the}} Communist authorities in the east wanted their citizens to believe. In addition, the East Berlin sign was carefully placed so that, when viewed from further away down Leipziger Straße, its display board obscured the West Berlin sign standing beyond it. Over the next two years, West Berlin would regularly raise or lower its sign to make it more easily visible from the East again– and then East Berlin would raise or lower its own construction to obscure it once more. Furthermore, the East German Government also exploited the huge facade of the nearby Columbushaus as a further propaganda tool.|$|E
25|$|Remembering the {{effective}} use of propaganda in the leadup to the second World War, the opposing camps later began berating one another with enormous signs displaying loud political slogans, facing {{each other across the}} border zone. That on the western side was erected first, in direct response to the ban on sales of Western newspapers in East Berlin, and comprised an <b>illuminated</b> <b>display</b> board 30 m wide and 1.5 m deep, facing east, supported on three steel lattice towers 25 m high and topped by the words DIE FREIE BERLINER PRESSE MELDET (The Free Berlin Press Announces). Important messages were spelt out on the display board using up to 2,000 bulbs. The sign was switched on {{for the first time on}} 10 October 1950, watched by a large crowd. A month later, on 18 November, the Communist authorities in the east ordered its destruction using a catapult made from a compressed air hose loaded with pebbles and small pieces of metal. However, the order was not executed and the sign lasted until 1974, an eventual victim of its own high maintenance costs.|$|E

500|$|The old First M.E. Church {{structure}} {{adjacent to}} Prospect Hill Park Cemetery on McCurdy Avenue (now Investment Place) and York Road was abandoned and eventually demolished in 1965. An <b>illuminated</b> <b>display</b> of {{the stained glass}} windows of the former church {{is located in the}} foyer of the current building. The Second M.P. Church structure was sold in 1954 to the Women's Club of Towson and still stands todayin 2005, the building was resold to an office development firm and is now used by an insurance agency. The erstwhile Epsom Chapel eventually became a meeting hall for Boy Scout troops in the 1920s1930s. It was subsequently abandoned and finally demolished in 1952 to make way for construction of a parking lot for the old Hutzler's department store, now a Barnes & Noble store near the present Macy's department store and Towson Town Center mall. No trace of Epsom Chapel exists today, except for an historical marker placed near the site by the Baltimore County Historical Society, designating it as the [...] "cradle of Methodism in Towson".|$|E

500|$|Construction {{work began}} on 2May 1936.

To try to meet the deadline, construction work was carried out both day and night.

50|$|First {{discovered}} {{shortly after}} Charlie Ginsburg invented the first video recorder for Ampex in 1956, video feedback {{was considered a}} nuisance and unwanted noise. Technicians and studio camera people were chastised for allowing a video camera to see its own monitor as the overload of self-amplified video signal wreaked havoc with the 1950s video pickup, often ruining the pickup. It could also cause screen burn-in on a playback TV and/or monitors of the time as well, by generating static brightly <b>illuminated</b> <b>display</b> patterns.|$|E

50|$|As {{reported}} by Karen DeMasters in The New York Times on December 16, 2001, in Hark, the Pterodactyl's Wing, every year Jim Gary provided hot chocolate, coffee, and cookies to those visiting an <b>illuminated</b> <b>display</b> of his sculpture, {{open to the}} public at his home, to celebrate the holidays in December. Lights were strung on the sculptures to delineate the structure of each dinosaur. During these displays Gary gave lectures and led discussions about his work.

The in-coupling PBS then reflects the S-polarized areas of light at 45° through the out-coupling beam splitter to a collimating reflector at the other end. Finally, the out-coupling beam splitter (which is a partially reflecting mirror, not a polarizing beam splitter) reflects the collimated light another 45° and into the wearer's eye.|$|E

In the paper weaving method is considered for electro textile design and process of flexible textile light-emitting display fabrication is described.

50|$|Modern lines {{characterized}} {{the architecture of}} the Quebec pavilion. Its exterior walls were made of glass; by day, these were enormous rectangular mirrors and, by night, an <b>illuminated</b> <b>display</b> case. Surrounded by water, the structure was accessible by way of a footbridge. Visitors then entered by large elevators; inside the pavilion. The pavilion's modern architecture and interior exhibit were {{in sharp contrast to the}} traditional image Canadians then had of this province. The exhibits focusing on urbanization, industrialization, business and education presented Quebec as a province with its eye on the future. Natural resources, forestry and water in particular were also presented as growth industries. In this reflection of Quebec society, the minimalist display methods themselves were an attraction: thousands of coloured steel cubes were used as part of the exhibits which was bathed in an electronic score by Quebec composer Gilles Tremblay in which synthetized whir, twitter and roar complemented the visual suggestions. High overhead, the distinctive soundtracks collided and coalesced into a contrapuntal aural landscape.|$|E
