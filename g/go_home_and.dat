5|$|In the end, Carys is {{reunited with}} her father. The team returns to Torchwood, {{and as she}} leaves for home, Jack advises Gwen {{not to let the}} job consume her because her {{perspective}} is important to the team. He then encourages Gwen to <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> spend time with Rhys.|$|E
5|$|She {{then moves}} {{out onto a}} dock, where she meets Ben Linus. Juliet is shown {{operating}} with Ethan and Goodwin (Brett Cullen) on a pregnant patient, Sabine, who dies; she is comforted by Goodwin. Juliet meets with Ben, and explains her theory that the problems with pregnant women happen at conception. She wants to test this theory by having a woman conceive off the island, but Ben refuses to let anyone off the island. When Juliet tells him that nothing else can be done and asks to <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> be with her sister, Ben informs Juliet that her sister's cancer has come back. He offers her a choice: either Juliet can <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> be with her sister as she dies, or she can stay and he will have Jacob cure her sister's cancer.|$|E
5|$|By mid-July, Maximilian and the Swabian leaders {{suddenly}} {{were under}} pressure from their own troops. In the west, where there lay an army {{under the command of}} count Heinrich von Fürstenberg, a large contingent of mercenaries from Flanders and many knights threatened to leave as they had not received their pay. The foot soldiers of the Swabian troops also complained: most of them were peasants and preferred to <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> bring in the harvest. Maximilian was forced to act.|$|E

5|$|Despite their successes, {{these three}} dissenters grew {{increasingly}} unpopular as most other delegates {{wanted to bring}} the Convention's business {{to an end and}} return home. As the Convention was drawing to a conclusion, and delegates prepared to refer the Constitution to the Committee on Style to pen the final version, one delegate raised an objection over civil trials. He wanted to guarantee the right to a jury trial in civil matters, and Mason saw in this a larger opportunity. Mason told the Convention that the constitution should include a bill of rights, which he thought could be prepared in a few hours. Gerry agreed, though the rest of the committee overruled them. They wanted to <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> thought this was nothing more than another delaying tactic.|$|E
5|$|The broadcast, {{aired on}} February 3, 2008, {{included}} excerpts from footage recorded from hidden cameras and microphones {{in the vehicle}} of Patrick van der Eem, a Dutch businessman and ex-convict who gained Van der Sloot's confidence. Van der Sloot was seen smoking marijuana and stating that he was with Holloway when she began convulsively shaking, then became unresponsive. Van der Sloot stated that he attempted to revive her, without success. He said that he called a friend, who told Van der Sloot to <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> who disposed of the body. An individual reputed to be this friend, identified in the broadcast as Daury, has denied Van der Sloot's account, indicating that he was then in Rotterdam at school.|$|E
5|$|Charles's {{cautious}} {{failure to}} directly assault the town, putting {{a higher priority}} on minimising losses than on victory, had cost the Royalists dearly; while claims for their number of dead and wounded men ranged from 1,000 to 1,500, only around 50 people inside the city were killed. Essex's force, on the other hand, was in relatively good shape; its one issue {{was the lack of}} supplies. If he stayed in the Severn Valley, Essex would be unable to get reinforcements or outside aid, the London elements of the army would demand to <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> the one remaining significant Parliamentarian force would find itself pinned down, while Charles, with secure bases at Oxford and Bristol, would be able to starve them into surrender while other Royalist armies ran rampant through Britain. Because of this, Essex {{had no choice but to}} try to return to London. Travelling back across the Cotswolds, as he had done to reach Gloucester initially, would expose the Parliamentarians to Charles's cavalry on open ground.|$|E

5|$|During the evening, {{elements}} of Morgan's army had advanced to within five miles (8km) of Corydon. The four Legion {{companies that had}} attempted to prevent the crossing had been reinforced by four additional companies from Corydon, one from Elizabeth, and one from New Amsterdam, making the force about four-hundred strong. They lured a company of unsuspecting Confederates into an ambush where they were surrounded; sixteen were captured and taken to the Corydon jail. The invaders also successfully captured about thirty defenders in several skirmishes. They were rounded up and held in a school house near Laconia. After Morgan crossed the river he addressed the prisoners {{and told them that}} if they would promise to <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> not return to arms, he would allow them to leave and keep their guns. They all agreed and were released.|$|E
5|$|Leslie gives Jess an art kit on his birthday, {{much to his}} delight. Jess becomes {{angry with}} his father's {{attitude}} to him, and refuses the existence of Terabithia {{the next day at}} school. Afterwards, Jess apologizes to Leslie by giving her a puppy, whom she names Prince Terrien. Once in Terabithia, they fight with various creatures, including a troll resembling Janice, and a squirrel-like creature resembling Hoager, whom they name the 'Sqoager'. At school, Leslie becomes frustrated by Janice's fee for using the toilet. Jess and Leslie play a prank on Janice, and she becomes the laughing stock of everyone on the bus. Once Leslie's parents finish their book, she and Jess help paint their house. Jess is impressed by her parents' happiness, and smiles as he watches their family. At school, Leslie discovers from an upset Janice that her bullying is due to her abusive father, and they become friends and later Janice becomes Jess' friend. Jess and Leslie take P.T. to Terabithia, where they fight off several creatures resembling students at their school. When it starts raining, they decide to <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> Jess looks on smiling as Leslie runs away.|$|E
5|$|Michael {{tries to}} {{introduce}} another murder and other twists {{to the story}} to pull his staff back into the party. This infuriates Jim to his breaking point, and they hold a private talk in Michael's office. Michael snaps at Jim and points out that he is doing this to keep the office calm. CFO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) finally returns the phone calls to Jim, and reveals that while nothing has been officially decided yet, Dunder Mifflin {{is expected to be}} insolvent by year-end. Jim hides the news from the staff and nudges them back into the party. Jim finally realizes that Michael was doing this to help his co-workers cope. At the end of the episode, Michael, Dwight, Andy, and Pam find themselves in a fake Mexican standoff lasting until 6:00 at night. Jim pulls Pam out so they can <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> the others pretend to shoot each other to death.|$|E

5|$|The {{next day}} at the tavern, Morrison meets Brown's wife (Agi Szirtes), and tells her that Brown is under {{suspicion}} for the theft and for the murder at the quayside. He asks for her help in finding him and repeats to her Mitchell's offer to Brown, but she remains silent. At home, Henriette tells Maloin she found a man in their hut at the seaside, and in fear locked the door and ran home. An agitated Maloin tells her not to tell anyone, and leaves for the hut. He unlocks the door, and receiving no response to his calling Brown's name, steps inside, closing the door behind. Minutes later he re-emerges, breathing heavily. After pausing to compose himself, he locks the door and leaves. In the next scene, Maloin presents the briefcase to Morrison in the tavern, and asks him to arrest him, confessing to having killed Brown an hour ago. Morrison leaves with Maloin for the hut, dismissing the frenzied inquiries of Brown's wife about her husband and handing the briefcase to the barkeep on the way out. Brown's wife follows the men to the hut, and emerges weeping with Morrison moments later. Back at the tavern, Morrison prepares two envelopes with {{a small portion of}} the recovered money in each. One he leaves with the grieving widow to whom he apologizes and wishes well, while the other he gives to Maloin, telling him that his case was one of self-defense. As he is preparing to leave, Morrison advises Maloin to <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> forget the whole affair. The camera focuses on the expressionless face of Brown's wife momentarily before fading to white.|$|E
5|$|Interviewed by Wallace, McHenry admits being angry after {{discovering}} his girlfriend's infidelity but denies {{that the blood}} on his clothing is hers. Montgomery tries to convince King to report her rape; King refuses, telling Montgomery {{that she does not}} understand {{what it is like to}} be raped. Wilder uses alternative medicine to help King deal with her pain. Psychiatrist Violet Turner (Amy Brenneman) refuses to talk to King about the rape because of similarities to the fetal abduction she experienced a year earlier, and wonders if everyone in the practice is cursed. Bennett wants to <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> rest, which angers Montgomery. King attempts to compose a memorandum saying that she was attacked on the hospital grounds, but Freedman suggests that another member of the staff do it for her; she shouts at Freedman when he calls her a victim. After the argument, Freedman goes to King's office and weeps when he sees the aftermath of her assault. McHenry admits raping a woman, assaulting Wallace before he is pulled away by the police. In the ambulance bay, Bennett expresses his confusion about Montgomery's mood swings and suspects that she is hiding something from him; Montgomery asks him to promise never to leave her alone. After Freedman helps her dress, King says that she loves him and wants to go home. McHenry is held by the police for assaulting a police officer during his arrest and Wallace during his interrogation, but detective Joe Price says that McHenry cannot be charged with rape until charges are filed against him. The episode ends with King walking out of the hospital with Freedman's help; flashbacks of the rape reveal that McHenry was the rapist.|$|E

25|$|Immediate {{surgery is}} not {{necessarily}} required. Occasionally people may <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> follow up for surgery {{in the next few}} days. A number of surgical techniques may be used including maxillomandibular fixation and open reduction internal fixation (ORIF). People are often put on antibiotics such as penicillin for a brief period of time. The evidence to support this practice; however, is poor.|$|E
25|$|On May 2, it was {{reported}} that WWE had sent Reeves home from television due to a contract dispute, and he did not participate in a battle royal match he was promoted for.

25|$|Once {{outside the}} hospital, Alder argued {{with the police}} officers, who had {{initially}} told him to <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> he was arrested to prevent a breach of the peace. A/PS Ellerington drove {{to the hospital to}} collect Alder for transport to the police station and detention. The vehicle used was a Mercedes-Benz Sprinter with a caged section in the rear. Although handcuffed, a witness would subsequently state that he recalled Alder climbed {{into the back of the}} van unassisted.|$|E
25|$|At this point, the {{rebellion}} {{spread throughout the}} entire province, and a large Kharijite coalition headed by the Sufri Abu Qurra al-Ifrani, 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Rustam, Abu Hatim, 'Asim al-Sidrati al-Ibadi and others advanced upon Tubna and placed it under siege. Despite being badly outnumbered by the rebels, 'Umar was able to extricate himself from the situation by bribing Abu Qurra's men to <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> defeating Ibn Rustam in battle. The remaining Kharijite forces under Abu Hatim decided to abandon Tubna and departed for al-Qayrawan, which they surrounded and besieged for eight months.|$|E
25|$|Napoleon {{hoped to}} flee to the United States from the port of Rochefort, while Fouché wished to hand the ex-emperor over to the Allies. Beker {{accompanied}} his former sovereign until 15 July, when Napoleon surrendered his person to the captain of a British man-of-war at the Île-d'Aix. After the event, Louis XVIII's war minister Marshal Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr peremptorily ordered Beker to <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> remain there. He was not reinstated in rank until 1818. He belatedly received the Order of Saint Louis in 1825 and the Grand Cordon of the Légion d'Honneur in 1831.|$|E
