50|$|An <b>{{electric}}</b> <b>knife</b> {{or electric}} carving knife is an electrical kitchen device used for slicing foods. An <b>electric</b> <b>knife</b> requires less physical effort than an ordinary knife and produces neater slices. The device {{consists of two}} serrated blades that are clipped together. When the appliance is switched on, the blades continuously move lengthways to provide the sawing action. In the UK, electric knives were popular in the 1970s and not as popular in today's kitchens.|$|E

50|$|Red drum have a {{moderate}} flavor {{and are not}} oily. Big drum can be tricky to clean; removing the large scales can be challenging. Many fishers prefer to fillet with an <b>electric</b> <b>knife,</b> first removing the fillet from along the backbone, and then using the <b>electric</b> <b>knife</b> to cut the fillet from the skin and scales. Fish over 15 lb can become tough and have a consistency comparable with chicken, rather than the flaky texture of many species of fish. Younger fish are often indistinguishable in flavor from black drum.|$|E
50|$|The {{invention}} of the <b>electric</b> <b>knife</b> is usually attributed to Jerome L. Murray, But there are other claimants such as Clem E. Kosterman who filed a patent in 1939.|$|E

40|$|In {{monitoring}} {{the depth of}} anesthesia (DOA), the electroencephalography (EEG) signals of patients have been utilized during surgeries to diagnose their level of consciousness. Different entropy methods were applied to analyze the EEG signal and measure its complexity, such as spectral entropy, approximate entropy (ApEn) and sample entropy (SampEn). However, as a weak physiological signal, EEG is easily subject to interference from external sources such as the <b>electric</b> power, <b>electric</b> <b>knives</b> and other electrophysiological signal sources, which lead {{to a reduction in}} the accuracy of DOA determination. In this study, we adopt the multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) to decompose and reconstruct the EEG recorded from clinical surgeries according to its best performance among the empirical mode decomposition (EMD), the ensemble EMD (EEMD), and the complementary EEMD (CEEMD) and the MEMD. Moreover, according to the comparison between SampEn and ApEn in measuring DOA, the SampEn is a practical and efficient method to monitor the DOA during surgeries at real time...|$|R
40|$|Wilson J. Warren {{provides}} important {{answers to}} that complex question. In this study, he traces {{the transformation of the}} red meat industry across the Midwest from the terminal stockyards in Chicago, Kansas City, and Omaha to plants near small towns, particularly in the Great Plains, where cattle and hogs arrive via trucks rather than railroad cars. Warren emphasizes the packers 2 ̆ 7 shift from buying through commission men at terminal markets to direct buying from farmers at plants located close to feed, water, and cheap labor. He also discusses the technical and marketing innovations that substantially changed the meatpacking industry, beginning about 1960, particularly with the introduction of <b>electric</b> <b>knives</b> and the shipment of precut and boxed meat directly to retailers. In addition, Warren traces ethnic change among meatpacking workers from first and second generation East Europeans in the major cities to whites, African Americans, Southeast Asians, and Latino workers in rural areas. And he provides an informative ethical discussion about killing animals for meat {{and the manner in which}} cattle and hogs are slaughtered (or not) before reaching the butchers 2 ̆ 7 knives...|$|R
50|$|Black drum are edible, with a {{moderate}} flavor {{and are not}} oily. Some restaurants in the southern US serve smaller black drum.

50|$|Uday's {{increasingly}} violent, sadistic tendencies {{are displayed}} when he kidnaps a 14-year-old school girl and forces her to escort {{him to a}} party. At the party, based on an actual 1988 celebration honoring Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's wife Suzanne, Uday becomes enraged with his father's personal bodyguard Kamel Hana Gegeo (Mehmet Ferda). Uday believes Gegeo facilitated an affair between Saddam and Samira Shahbandar, which devastated his mother, Sajida Talfah, and he also expresses jealousy at the trust his father places in Kamel Hana. When Gegeo passes sarcastic comments about Uday's sexual advances towards his young victim, Uday butchers him with an <b>electric</b> carving <b>knife</b> {{in front of all}} of the guests. The next morning, Uday's bodyguards are seen dumping the partially naked, beaten body of the young girl.|$|R
50|$|Although {{his status}} as Saddam's elder son made him Saddam's {{prospective}} successor, Uday fell out of favour with his father. In October 1988, {{at a party in}} honour of Suzanne Mubarak, wife of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Uday murdered his father's personal valet and food taster, Kamel Hana Gegeo, possibly at the request of his mother. According to Jalopnik website, Uday's vast car collections were burned by his father, Saddam, after the Kamel Hana Gegeo incident. Before an assemblage of horrified guests, an intoxicated Uday bludgeoned Gegeo and repeatedly stabbed him with an <b>electric</b> carving <b>knife.</b> Gegeo had recently introduced Saddam to a younger woman, Samira Shahbandar, who later became Saddam's second wife. Uday considered his father's relationship with Shahbandar an insult to his mother. He also may have feared losing succession to Gegeo, whose loyalty and fidelity to Saddam Hussein was unquestioned..|$|R
5000|$|Rothenberg, {{the son of}} American poet Jerome Rothenberg, {{worked at}} MacWEEK in San Francisco, where he was {{reportedly}} author of the magazine's [...] "Mac the Knife" [...] rumor column and its online counterpart, The <b>Electric</b> <b>Knife.</b> He was editor-in-chief of eWEEK magazine and editorial director at Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S. and currently works as editor-in-chief at TheLadders, a leading site for senior-level job seekers.|$|E
50|$|The meat is shaved off {{the stack}} {{with a large}} knife, an <b>electric</b> <b>knife</b> or a small {{circular}} saw, dropping to a circular tray below to be retrieved. Shawarma is eaten as a fast food, made up into a sandwich wrap with pita or lavash together with vegetables and dressing. A variety of vegetables come with the shawarma which include: cucumber, onion, tomato, lettuce, eggplant, parsley, pickled turnips, pickles, rhubarb, cabbage or French fries.|$|E
50|$|Homemade padding {{is usually}} made by cutting {{a block of}} {{high-density}} polyurethane foam rubber to shape. This is {{the same type of}} foam as used for upholstery. The most common tool used for shaping the foam for this application is an <b>electric</b> <b>knife.</b> The block is usually cut as a flat piece which is wrapped around the hips and buttocks, rather than being carved as a curved piece. The foam is carved only on the inside, so that the outside surface remains smooth.|$|E
5|$|The cookiecutter shark {{exhibits}} {{a number of}} specializations to its mouth and pharynx for its parasitic lifestyle. The shark first secures itself to the body surface of its prey by closing its spiracles and retracting its basihyal (tongue) to create pressure {{lower than that of}} the surroundings; its suctorial lips ensure a tight seal. It then bites, using its narrow upper teeth as anchors while its razor sharp lower teeth slice into the prey. Finally, the shark twists and rotates its body to complete a circular cut, quite possibly aided by the initial forward momentum and subsequent struggles of its prey. The action of the lower teeth may also be assisted by back-and-forth vibrations of the jaw, a mechanism akin to that of an <b>electric</b> carving <b>knife.</b> This shark's ability to create strong suction into its mouth is likely also of utility in capturing smaller prey such as squid.|$|R
500|$|Midway {{through the}} interview, Lyons was allowed a break, {{during which he}} was seen by a doctor, and was given medication. He also met his father during this break. He told his father that he had {{committed}} the murder, to which his father replied: [...] "Dean, you are a terrible liar". The gardaí had an informal meeting during the break, during which some gardaí expressed unease about Dean Lyons; Detective Garda Cox described him as a [...] "Walter Mitty" [...] character during this meeting. There are some significant changes in Lyons' story after the break. For example: prior to the break, he claimed that he had used only one knife and after the break, {{he said that he}} had used four separate weapons, including <b>electric</b> carving <b>knives.</b> The latter description matches closely to Professor Harbison's report. A number of detailed descriptions were given which matched closely with the physical evidence and with the psychological profile.|$|R
50|$|Throughout much of {{the album}} (recorded in just one day for a Christmas release), both Cook and {{especially}} Moore are drunk and out of control, with Moore in particular regularly collapsing in hysterics (Cook achieving his primary comic aim of making Moore laugh with regular ease). Shortly after the album's release, controversy unsurprisingly erupted {{in a variety of}} forms, most notably a petrol station attendant being fired from his job after it was discovered that he owned a copy of the album (Cook testified at the man's industrial tribunal), and a distributor of talking books accidentally sending out copies of Come Again on cassette in cases intended for the children's classic Black Beauty. The CD reissue adds several previously unreleased routines, including a sketch about Derek (Moore) cutting his wife's hymen out with an <b>electric</b> carving <b>knife,</b> and one of their most popular sketches amongst their fans, 'Mother', in which Moore plays Cooks hysterical, domineering, deranged mother. Like {{much of the}} extra material, it was actually recorded during the 'Ad Nauseam' sessions {{a couple of years later}} than the original Come Again album.|$|R
50|$|Sheldon doesn't know it, but Wilkes {{has known}} all along {{that he has been}} sneaking around her house. This sets off one of the film's most infamous scenes, in which she breaks his ankles with a {{sledgehammer}} to stop him from escaping. In the book she chops off his foot with an axe and cauterizes it with a blowtorch, and later cuts off one of his thumbs with an <b>electric</b> <b>knife</b> when he complains about a missing letter on his typewriter (this never happens in the film).|$|E
5000|$|Believing that Turkie is dead, the {{surviving}} teens {{go back to}} Kristen's house. While Johnny and Kristen admit their feelings for each other, Darren awkwardly goes {{to the kitchen to}} get a snack. There, Turkie rips Darren's tongue and heart out, and stabs Johnny with an <b>electric</b> <b>knife.</b> As Johnny dies, Kristen sets Turkie on fire with an aerosol flamethrower, and knocks him into a pile of wood. Later, at a family's Thanksgiving dinner, the cooked turkey comes to life, and in Turkie's voice yells, [...] "Do I smell sequel, biotch?!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Lewis {{stopped working}} with Friedman after making Color Me Blood Red, but {{continued}} to make further gore films into the 1970s. His next gore entry wouldn't come until 1967, with A Taste of Blood, {{often referred to as}} the [...] "Gone with the Wind of Gore" [...] due to its relatively lengthy running time of nearly two hours. The following year would bring a more extreme take on the genre, The Gruesome Twosome (1967), most notable for incorporating an <b>electric</b> <b>knife</b> used to scalp one of the victims.|$|E
40|$|Backgrounds. With {{respect to}} the knife’s design in {{colorectal}} endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), diameter, water jet function, and electric power are important because these relate to efficient dissection. In this study, we analyzed a novel, narrow ball tip-typed ESD knife with water jet function (Flush knife BT-S, diameter: 2. 2 [*]mm, length: 2000 [*]mm, Fujifilm Co., Tokyo, Japan) compared to a regular diameter knife (Flush knife BT, diameter: 2. 6 [*]mm, length: 1800 [*]mm). Methods. In laboratory and clinical research, <b>electric</b> power, <b>knife</b> insertion time, vacuum/suction amount with knife in the endoscopic channel, and water jet function were analyzed. We used a knife 2. 0 [*]mm long for BT-S and BT knives. Results. The BT-S showed faster mean knife insertion time (sec) and better vacuum amount (ml/min) compared to the BT (insertion time: 16. 7 versus 21. 6, p< 0. 001, vacuum amount: 38. 0 versus 14. 0, p< 0. 01). Additionally, the water jet function of the BT-S was not inferior. In 39 colorectal ESD cases in two institutions, there were mean 4. 7 times (range: 1 – 28) of knife insertion. Suction under knife happened 59 % (23 / 39) and suction of fluid {{could be done in}} 100 %. Conclusions. Our study showed that the narrow knife allows significantly faster knife insertion, better vacuum function, and effective clinical results...|$|R
5000|$|El-Kashef was {{involved}} in the protests at Tahrir Square, where she filmed the events of the Arab Spring as they unfolded. She {{was one of the first}} protestors to occupy Tahrir where she set up a tent. She also documented [...] "aggressive assaults against women" [...] that occurred during the protests often risking her own personal safety. El-Kashef's films of men sexually assaulting women were shown worldwide and El-Kashef and her friends vowed to fight back, carrying <b>electric</b> prods and <b>knives</b> as protection. She was arrested and detained for her participation in the No Military Trials for Civilians protest. El-Kashef missed the promotion of Ship of Theseus in India while she was protesting. Another aspect of the protests was her involvement in filming the grief of family members who raided the Zeinhom Morgue in Cairo to see their loved ones one last time.|$|R

It turns out that Dr. Prell and Werner are cannibals, using the Yeti scam {{as a way to}} lure victims, and that the Yeti is actually Dr. Werner in disguise. While Karen is asleep upstairs, Keith returns to the house and discovers Dr. Prell and Dr. Werner discussing what to do with her. Werner thinks they should just kill her, but Prell says that the code calls for no body bruises and that she must be frightened to death.Keith pulls out a rifle and orders both men to put their hands up. They ignore him.He shoots at them, finding out that the shells are blanks. He is then knocked unconscious by Laughing Crow.Still asleep upstairs, Karen wakes to a growling noise. She looks out the window and finds the Yeti running full speed at the house. Karen flees through the house and ends up trapped in a bathroom. She opens a cabinet to find Laughing Crow holding a knife, and dies of fear.While setting up for their big breakfast, Keith wakes up and manages to sneak away.He tries to escape in the van,but it gets stuck in the mud while trying to hide from the party guests funeral procession. Keith then hoofs it down to the bridge where he manages to flag down a cop who takes him back to the house.At the breakfast, Prell and Werner salute the party guests and hosts, toasting the previous schemes which have provided victims. Keith returns with a local policeman, only to find out that he too is a cannibal. Prell and Werener explain that the [...] "gin sung" [...] Keith has eaten is actually human flesh, and they invite him to join their cannibalistic society. They bring in Karen's body, and Laughing Crow, brandishing an <b>electric</b> carving <b>knife,</b> speaks for the first time, saying [...] "Mr. Henshaw — white meat or dark?" [...] Keith drools. The film ends.|$|R
