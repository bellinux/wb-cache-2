50|$|The Parallel ATA {{standard}} {{is the result}} of a long history of incremental technical development, which began with the original AT Attachment interface, developed for use in early PC AT equipment. The ATA interface itself evolved in several stages from Western Digital's original <b>Integrated</b> <b>Drive</b> Electronics (IDE) interface. As a result, many near-synonyms for ATA/ATAPI and its previous incarnations are still in common informal use, in particular Extended IDE (EIDE) and Ultra ATA (UATA). After the introduction of Serial ATA (SATA) in 2003, the original ATA was renamed to Parallel ATA, or PATA for short.|$|E

50|$|AMCA uses {{fibre optic}} {{gyroscope}}, ring laser gyroscope and MEMS gyroscope. The pressure probes and vanes {{that make up}} the air data sensors is an optical and flush air data system, position of the sensors is in linear/rotary optical encoders. Importantly, actuators - currently electro-hydraulic/direct drive - could be electro-hydrostatic to accurate substantive weight savings on the AMCA. The aircraft has integrated radio and navigation system supported by IRNSS, where all burdens earlier borne by analogue circuits will be carried out by digital processors. Communication systems are based on software radio ranging from UHF to K band, with data links for digital data/voice data and video footage. The aircraft is equipped with AMAGB gearbox, which is designed and produced by CVRDE. The castings are made of magnesium alloy and the gearbox has its own self-contained lubrication system. AMAGB operates in two modes. In the starter mode, it aids in starting the engine through jet fuel starter. In accessory mode, it drives two hydraulic pumps and an <b>integrated</b> <b>drive</b> generator. These accessories, in turn, generate hydraulic and electrical power for the aircraft.|$|E
50|$|The term <b>Integrated</b> <b>Drive</b> Electronics refers {{not just}} to the {{connector}} and interface definition, but also {{to the fact that the}} drive controller is integrated into the drive, as opposed to a separate controller on or connected to the motherboard. The interface cards used to connect a parallel ATA drive to, for example, a PCI slot are not drive controllers: they are merely bridges between the host bus and the ATA interface. Since the original ATA interface is essentially just a 16-bit ISA bus in disguise, the bridge was especially simple in case of an ATA connector being located on an ISA interface card. The integrated controller presented the drive to the host computer as an array of 512-byte blocks with a relatively simple command interface. This relieved the mainboard and interface cards in the host computer of the chores of stepping the disk head arm, moving the head arm in and out, and so on, as had to be done with earlier ST-506 and ESDI hard drives. All of these low-level details of the mechanical operation of the drive were now handled by the controller on the drive itself. This also eliminated the need to design a single controller that could handle many different types of drives, since the controller could be unique for the drive. The host need only to ask for a particular sector, or block, to be read or written, and either accept the data from the drive or send the data to it.|$|E
5000|$|The AT Attachment (ATA) {{hard disk}} {{interface}} is directly descended from ISA (the AT bus). ATA has {{its origins in}} hardcards that integrated a hard disk controller (HDC) — usually with an ST-506/ST-412 interface — and a hard disk drive on the same ISA adapter. This was at best awkward from a mechanical structural standpoint, as ISA slots were not designed to support such heavy devices as hard disks (and the 3.5" [...] form-factor hard disks of the time were about twice as tall and heavy as modern drives), so {{the next generation of}} <b>Integrated</b> <b>Drive</b> Electronics drives moved both the drive and controller to a drive bay and used a ribbon cable and a very simple interface board to connect it to an ISA slot. ATA, at its essence, is basically a standardization of this arrangement, combined with a uniform command structure for software to interface with the controller on a drive. ATA has since been separated from the ISA bus, and connected directly to the local bus (usually by integration into the chipset), to be clocked much much faster than ISA could support and with much higher throughput. (Notably when ISA was introduced as the AT bus, there was no distinction between a local and extension bus, and there were no chipsets.) Still, ATA retains details which reveal its relationship to ISA. The 16-bit transfer size is the most obvious example; the signal timing, particularly in the PIO modes, is also highly correlated, and the interrupt and DMA mechanisms are clearly from ISA. (The article about ATA has more detail about this history.) ...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The {{deaerator}} is {{a mechanical}} device {{that is used}} to separate air from oil. The deaerator is a component of the <b>Integrated</b> <b>Drive</b> Generator (IDG). The <b>Integrated</b> <b>Drive</b> Generator is used in aircrafts as the main power generator. Oil is used in the IDG as a lubricant and coolant. Air is trapped in the oil due to high suction forces of the oil pumps. The entrained air adversely affects the lubricative and thermal properties of oil. Centrifugal forces inside the deaerator are used to remove this entrained air from the oil. Hamilton Sundstrand has several different deaerator models, but has been unable to evaluate the efficiency of oil separation for different designs. Our goal is to evaluate the efficiency of two deaerator models. The evaluation will be based on experimental and theoretical data. The experimental data will be collected using an actual deaerator setup. The theoretical data will be collected using computational fluid dynamic (CFD) software models. ANSYS CFX software will be used for CFD models. The experimental results will then be compared to the theoretical results. An analysis of both results will lead {{to a better understanding of}} flow separation. B. S. (Bachelor of Science...|$|E
