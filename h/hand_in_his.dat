5|$|John Peckham, Archbishop of Canterbury, died in December 1292. On 13 February 1293, Winchelsey {{was elected}} as his successor. Unusually, neither the pope nor {{the king had}} a <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> election. On 1 April, Winchelsey left England for Rome to get papal confirmation. He was not consecrated {{immediately}} because of a papal vacancy; Celestine V eventually performed the ceremony at Aquila on 12 September 1294.|$|E
5|$|Three years later, Stone {{followed}} Kelley’s example. In 1843, a deacon {{was expelled}} from Stone's church for his antislavery activities, which included supporting Kelley by hosting her at his home and driving her to lectures that she gave in the vicinity. When the first vote for expulsion was taken, Stone raised her <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> defense. The minister discounted her vote, saying that, though {{she was a member}} of the church, she was not a voting member. Like Kelley, she stubbornly raised her hand for each of the remaining five votes.|$|E

5|$|Wilson {{became a}} Christian {{at the age}} of 23. He has adopted a gesture of {{crossing}} his arms, with his left <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> glove and his right hand underneath pointing with the index finger while looking at the sky, which both honors The Holy Trinity as well as his late father who died of cancer when Wilson was 17. He performs it when he records a save or closes out a game.|$|E
5|$|Sleight of hand during stage magic {{performances}} is not common, as most magic {{events and}} stunts are performed with objects visible {{to a much}} larger audience, but is nevertheless done occasionally by many stage performers. The most common magic tricks performed with sleight of hand on stage are rope manipulations and card tricks, with the first typically being done {{with a member of}} the audience to rule out the possibility of stooges and the latter primarily being done on a table while a camera is live-recording, allowing the rest of audience to see the performance on a big screen. Worldwide acclaimed stage magician David Copperfield often include illusions featuring sleight of <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> stage shows.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the {{first-class}} season, Pathan scored 56 but took a total of only 1/91 for the Board President's XI against the touring Australians ahead of the Test series, and he was overlooked for Test selection as India used only two pacemen. He returned to play for Baroda in the Ranji Trophy. He played in four matches and performed strongly, taking 26 wickets at 16.03 and scored 166 runs at 33.20. He started the season with 6/85 and 1/34 in a draw against Uttar Pradesh, and then took 4/42 and 1/46 against Railways. He then put on an all-round display to guide his team to a victory over Maharashtra. Pathan took 5/64 and then scored 51 as Baroda made 305 in their first innings to take a 77-run lead. After taking 1/61 in the second innings, he scored an unbeaten 50 to guide Baroda to their target of 227 with four wickets in <b>hand.</b> <b>In</b> <b>his</b> final Ranji fixture for the season, he took 7/35 in the first innings to help dismiss Andhra Pradesh for 77, setting up an innings win. However, with India persisting with and tasting success with their Test bowling strategy, Pathan was also overlooked for the home Tests against England. Pathan's domestic season was interrupted by spasmodic limited overs duty. Following his recent uneconomical run in ODIs, he was not given a game in the seven-match series against England in November until India had taken an unassailable 4–0 series lead. He took 0/57 from ten overs in the fifth match, as India recorded another victory, but did not get another opportunity after the Mumbai terrorist attacks saw the two remaining fixtures cancelled. Pathan was then selected for the early-2009 five-match ODI tour of Sri Lanka, but was not entrusted with a match until India took an unbeatable 3–0 lead. He took four wickets at 28.25 in two matches, but was again expensive, conceding 7.06 runs an over. However, he ended the tour on a high note when he combined with half-brother Yusuf in an unbroken eighth-wicket stand that saw India to a three-wicket win in the T20 international after a late flurry; Irfan ended on 33 not out. Pathan returned to India and took 3/50 and scored 51 not out in his only domestic one-dayer for Baroda during the season, which ended in a win, before leaving for the limited overs leg of a tour to New Zealand.|$|E

25|$|Headphones {{originated}} from the telephone receiver earpiece, {{and were the}} only way to listen to electrical audio signals before amplifiers were developed.

25|$|However, injury stalled Smith's {{progress}} once again, when {{he suffered}} another training ground injury – {{this time to}} his <b>hand.</b> <b>In</b> <b>his</b> absence Gareth McAuley and Damien Delaney formed a solid defensive partnership ahead of deputising goalkeeper Arran Lee-Barrett. Smith was unable to force his {{way back into the}} first team in the short-term.|$|E

25|$|That year, Turner would {{regularly}} shoot {{around in}} a hall just off Queens Boulevard. There he encountered Vincent Smith, brother of NBA star Kenny Smith. Vince tutored Turner in footwork, how to come off screens, dribbling and finishing with his left <b>hand.</b> <b>In</b> <b>his</b> final year of high school, Turner didn't merely make the team; he was the main man, winning himself a scholarship.|$|E
25|$|After the war, {{he complained}} that {{opportunities}} for critical thinking {{within the context}} of the communist arena had been curtailed by what he characterised as a centralised bourgeois political control. Finding this unacceptable, he broke with the Danish Communist Party, although he did not <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> membership until the mid-1960s and remained committed philosophically to a revision of the Marxist analysis of capitalism from the point of view of the artist.|$|E
25|$|Distinguished {{in figure}} and manners, Abelard was seen {{surrounded}} by crowds – {{it is said}} thousands of students – drawn from all countries by the fame of his teaching. Enriched by the offerings of his pupils, and entertained with universal admiration, he came, as he says, to think himself the only undefeated philosopher in the world. But a change in his fortunes was at <b>hand.</b> <b>In</b> <b>his</b> devotion to science, he had always lived a very regular life, enlivened only by philosophical debate: now, {{at the height of}} his fame, he encountered romance.|$|E

25|$|Fleva {{was again}} in Parliament in December 1894, when he {{narrowly}} lost the elections for Assembly Vice President. He had a notoriously tense relationship with Eugeniu Carada, who, as the National Liberal's economic adviser, had helped establish Romania's National Bank. In February 1894, Fleva upset Carada by running for National Bank Censor, {{with support from}} the Conservatives and the Junimists. Like the other National Liberal deputies, Fleva resented the ultra-capitalist Law on Mining, passed by the Conservative majority. However, he distanced himself from those deputies who resigned in protest against the bill: when he did <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> resignation, it was rejected by his Conservative friends, including Filipescu.|$|E
25|$|In Game 6, Pippen {{made the}} {{signature}} play of his career. Midway {{in the third}} quarter, Pippen received the ball during a Bulls fast break, charging toward the basket. As center Patrick Ewing jumped up to defend the shot, Pippen fully extended the ball out, absorbing body contact and a foul from Ewing, and slammed the ball through the hoop with Ewing's <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> face. Pippen landed several {{feet away from the}} basket along the baseline, incidentally walking over a fallen Ewing. He then made taunting remarks to both Ewing and then Spike Lee, who was standing courtside supporting the Knicks, thus receiving a technical foul. This extended the Bulls' lead to 17; they won 93–79.|$|E
25|$|For {{the next}} few years he {{continued}} to work on the Missa, composing piano sonatas and bagatelles to satisfy the demands of publishers and the need for income, and completing the Diabelli Variations. He was ill again for an extended time in 1821, and completed the Missa in 1823, three years after its original due date. He also opened discussions with his publishers over the possibility of producing a complete edition of his work, an idea that was arguably not fully realised until 1971. Beethoven's brother Johann began to take a <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> business affairs, much in the way Kaspar had earlier, locating older unpublished works to offer for publication and offering the Missa to multiple publishers with the goal of getting a higher price for it.|$|E

25|$|In March 1949, he {{was arrested}} by the regime's secret police, the Securitate. The latter {{discovered}} his name while investigating the Bucharest connections of the armed resistance movement. Late in 1948, Tonegaru had obtained a Belgian Red Cross parcel for Teohar Mihadaş, a poet and {{former member of the}} fascist Iron Guard, who, unbeknown to his benefactor, had passed it on to an anti-communist fighter in his native Bistriţa. Caught up in the subsequent Securitate clampdown, Mihadaș was tortured until he implicated his connections. According to one account, the Securitate officers storming into Tonegaru's house treated him like a ringleader, and, having misinterpreted a piece of paper on which the poet had sketched out a piece titled Pistolul lui Werther ("Werther's Gun"), pressed him to <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> weapons, and repeatedly beat him with a crop.|$|E
25|$|Throughout Dijkstra's career, {{his work}} was {{characterized}} by elegance and economy. A prolific writer (especially as an essayist), Dijkstra authored more than 1,300 papers, many written by <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> precise script. They were essays and parables; fairy tales and warnings; comprehensive explanation and pedagogical pretext. Most were about mathematics and computer science; others were trip reports that are more revealing about their author than about the people and places visited. It was his habit to copy each paper and circulate it to {{a small group of}} colleagues who would copy and forward the papers to another limited group of scientists. His love affair with simplicity came at an early age and under his mother's guidance. He once said he had asked his mother whether trigonometry was a difficult topic. She replied that he must learn all the formulas and that furthermore if he required more than five lines to prove something, he was on the wrong track.|$|E
25|$|That night Walt goes to {{the gang}} members' house, where they draw their weapons on him. He loudly berates them and enumerates their crimes, drawing the {{attention}} of the neighbors. Putting a cigarette in his mouth, he asks for a light, then puts his <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> jacket and provocatively pulls it out as if he were holding a gun, causing the gang members to shoot and kill him. As he falls to the ground, his hand opens to reveal the Zippo cigarette lighter with the 1st Cavalry insignia; he was unarmed. His plan had in fact been to provoke them into killing him in public. Sue, following Walt's directions, frees Thao, and they drive to the scene in Walt's Gran Torino. One of the police officers tells them that all gang members have been placed under arrest for the murder, and due to the number of witnesses, they all face a lengthy stay in prison.|$|E
