25|$|Organised retail {{will need}} workers. Walmart employs 1.4 {{million people in}} United States alone. With United States {{population}} of about 300 million, and India's population of about 1200 million, if Walmart-like retail companies were to expand in India {{as much as their}} presence in the United States, and the staffing level in Indian stores kept at the same level as in the United States stores, Walmart alone would employ 5.6 million Indian citizens. Walmart has a 6.5% market share of the total United States retail. Adjusted for this market share, the expected jobs in future Indian organised retail would total over 85 million. In addition, millions of additional jobs will be created during the building of and the maintenance of retail stores, roads, cold storage centers, software industry, <b>electronic</b> <b>cash</b> registers and other retail supporting organisations. Instead of job losses, retail reforms are likely to be massive boost to Indian job availability.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{determinants}} of the choice of payment instrument for low-value day-to-day transactions. Using Japanese household data from 2007 to 2014, we find that three payment instruments, namely, <b>cash,</b> <b>electronic</b> money, and credit cards, comprise the major payment choices for transactions with values less than 1, 000 yen (about 8. 7 euros). We also find that high-income, financially sophisticated households in urban areas tend to use both <b>electronic</b> money and <b>cash.</b> Further, family households choosing <b>electronic</b> money and <b>cash</b> do not have higher cash holdings compared with family households exclusively choosing cash, holding all other variables constant. We obtain weak evidence that single-person households choosing <b>electronic</b> money and <b>cash</b> have higher cash holdings compared with single-person households exclusively choosing cash, holding all other variables constant...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Integrated circuit {{cards or}} smart cards are now well-known. Applications such as <b>electronic</b> purses (<b>cash</b> units stored in cards), {{subscriber}} identification cards used in cellular telephone or access keys for pay-TV and information highways emerge {{in many places}} with millions of users. More services are required by applications providers and card holders. Mainly, new integrated circuit cards evolve towards non-predefined multi-purpose, open and multi-user applications. Today, operating systems implemented into integrated circuit cards cannot respond to these new trends. They have evolved from simple operating systems defining an hardware abstraction level up to file management systems or database management systems where the card behavior was defined once at the manufacturing level or by the card issuer. The needs for open and flexible card life cycle enabling to accommodate executable code loaded by different service providers require {{a new generation of}} smart cards. Operating systems based on object-oriented technologies are key components for future integrated circuit cards applications...|$|R
