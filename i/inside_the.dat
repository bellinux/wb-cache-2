50|$|In haunches-in, {{the horse}} bends its {{hindquarters}} slightly to <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> of <b>the</b> arena, {{away from the}} arena wall, so that the horse is bent {{in the direction of}} movement. The front legs and shoulders should not move from the original track. This produces the four tracks, with the outer track made by the outside foreleg, the second track by <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> foreleg, <b>the</b> third track by the outside hind leg, and <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> track made by <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> hind leg.|$|R
50|$|The charged object C is touched to <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> of <b>the</b> container. The charge {{detector}} reading {{does not}} change. However, if {{the object is}} now withdrawn from the container, the reading stays the same, indicating that the container now has a net charge. If the object is then tested with the charge detector, it {{is found to be}} completely uncharged, and <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> of <b>the</b> container is also found to be uncharged. This indicates that all the charge on C has been transferred to the container, and has exactly neutralized the opposite charge on <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> surface of <b>the</b> container, leaving only the charge on the outside. So the charge on <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> of <b>the</b> container was exactly equal to the charge on C.|$|R

Since the tissue layers are very thin, they provide too little power to swim against currents and just enough to control movement within currents.|$|E

After, new track was constructed {{outside of the}} building which is used as the high-speed test for Test Track. Work <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> building also continued at the same time. It was scheduled to open 29 months after World of Motion's closing, in May 1997, but after numerous problems rose, the ride opening was delayed by nearly 2 years. Also, the cars used on the ride were designed to resemble {{the look of a}} test car that is used to go through multiple safety tests.|$|E

Hair similar to Lady Lucan's was also found <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> car.|$|E
5|$|Auburn's offense {{took over}} at its one-yard line after Tech's failure to score. Jason Campbell orchestrated a {{successful}} drive that took Auburn from {{the shadow of}} its own end zone, completing passes of 16yards, 15yards, and 37yards in the process. <b>Inside</b> <b>the</b> Virginia Tech red zone, however, the Auburn offense again stumbled. As it had in its two previous scoring drives, Auburn was forced to send in kicker John Vaughn despite being <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> Virginia Tech 10-yard line. Vaughn's 24-yard kick was successful, and with 1:50 remaining in the second quarter, Auburn extended its lead to 9â€“0.|$|E

5|$|Georgia Tech's first {{possession}} of the half was slightly more successful than Wake Forest's, as the Yellow Jackets drove <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> Deacons' 30-yard line on several passes from Reggie Ball. Again, however, the Tech defense stumbled. Facing a fourth down <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> Wake Forest red zone, Tech elected to attempt to convert the first down rather than punt the ball. Despite needing just one yard to gain another first down, Georgia Tech was stopped short of the line. The play {{was typical of the}} third quarter, which saw both teams fail to score.|$|E
