Organisational creativity is created by individuals in the right environment for using their creativity. In this paper we present theories about creative individuals and the situation that affects their creativity. Furthermore theories are presented about different strategies that aim to increase creativity. The importance of the preparation of a problem is highlighted. Two interviews were conducted with the Vice President and Creative Director, moreover did the authors visit an idea meeting at the company. This is the base for the empirical part. The situation and strategies for creativity in the theoretical part and the empirical part is compared. Liljedal has a focus on becoming a creative organisation; this is noticeable both in their work environment and their working strategy. The conclusion is that Liljedals have good possibilities to work creatively. They also have a strategy worked out in detail for their creative work, this strategy is well conformed with the researchers strategies for increased creativity...|$|E

This study evaluates the impact ofinput errors associated with satellite sensor noise for a spatial method aimed at characterisingaspects of landscapes associated with the historical village structure, called the HybridCharacterisation Model (HCM), that was developed as a tool to monitor sub goals of theSwedish Environmental Goal “A varied agricultural landscape”. The method and errorsimulation method employed for generating random errors in the input data, is implemented andautomated as a Python script enabling easy iteration of the procedure. The HCM is evaluatedqualitatively (by visual analysis) and quantitatively comparing kappa index values between theoutputs affected by error. Comparing the result of the qualitative and quantitative evaluationshows that the kappa index is an applicable measurement of quality for the HCM. Thequalitative analysis compares impact of error for two different scales, the village scale and thelandscape scale, and shows that the HCM is performing well on the landscape scale for up to 30 % error and on the village scale for up to 10 % and shows that the impact of error differsdepending on the shape of the analysed feature.

The focus of the study is to find out more about how difficulties in reading and writing can affect the time in school and if there may be links between illiteracy and a negative self-image, and if there is a risk that the difficulties could lead to an exclusion for the student.   Life story was used as a method to take part of my informant’s experiences from a social constructionist perspective with the understanding that meaning is created in the interaction with others. Initially, it was an interview conversation with the informant, which was then compiled into a life story.   In the result I came to the conclusion that there is an increased risk for low self-esteem of students who has reading and writing difficulties, especially if they do not get the proper support and backing of the school. A student rarely chooses an exclusion but sometimes feels that is a way to avoid risking failure. Shame and a negative self-image is common with students who struggle with reading and writing. Success factors are the teachers' pedagogical skills in which they have a varied approach and in a good way can join the student's conditions with environmental requirements.

Due to the broadcasting nature of wireless communication medium, adversaries can eavesdrop on network traffic to obtain valuable information. Existing security technologies cannot always protect the cyber-security needs of users and the run applications, in terms of data confidentially and integrity and user privacy and anonymity. Network traffic analysis {{can be used by}} an adversary <b>to</b> <b>extra</b> <b>important</b> information related <b>to</b> the node location, functionality, and identity. Traffic patterns of WSNs can reveal a great deal of contextual information, which can disclose the location of critical nodes. For example, sensing data are transmitted along relatively fixed paths connecting source nodes to a sink. This produces quite easily identifiable traffic patterns that reveal a sink's location. In addition, the sensing nodes having one-hop distance from the sink have to forward a significantly greater volume of packets, since they have to route all the traffic generated by all those nodes that are farther than nodes having one-hop away from the sink. An adversary having a global view of WSN's traffic activity can deduce the location of the sink by observing and analyzing the traffic volume distribution within WSN's coverage area for an adequately long time interval. Discovery of a sink's location may allow the adversary to launch precise physical and cyber attacks against the sink and thereby disable the network.|$|R

Participants and context: A total of 233 relatives from 23 different special care units participated. Ethical consideration: The study was approved by the Norwegian Social Science Data Services. Results: A great majority of relatives reported that they visited weekly and were the resident’s spokesperson, but seldom really participated in decisions concerning their everyday care. Participation was seldom reported as a burden. Discussion: This study indicated that relatives were able to make a difference to their near one’s everyday life and ensure quality of care based on their biographical expertise, intimate knowledge about and emotional bond with the resident.

40|$|High Cycle Fatigue (HCF) {{failure is}} a common failure type for many {{mechanical}} components. Traditional HCF design {{is based on the}} deterministic safety factor approach, typically used in conjunction with the point stress method. A current development is to explicitly model the uncertainty of the design set-up, and compute the probability of failure, pf. If pf can be computed in an appropriate way, the contributions to fatigue can be identified and managed. Probabilistic design gives improved control over safety, which helps to avoid overly conservative design. One of the applications dealt with in this work is gas turbine compressor blades. For this type of component requirements on safety coincide with requirements on high efficiency, low weight, etc. In such case, methods for accurate fatigue assessment become <b>extra</b> <b>important.</b> In order <b>to</b> perform an appropriate fatigue design, certain requirements must be fulfilled. For example, the fatigue model that is used must be accurate and the relevant material parameters must be accurately determined. Other requirements are that the mesh used in the FE-computations for the stress field is fine enough, a HCF post-processor that enables application of fatigue models to real components must be available and a method for computation of pf including all uncertainties should also be available. In Paper A, it is shown that for a gas turbine compressor blade, it is the number of elements through the blade’s thickness that is the most important mesh property for convergence in. In Paper B, it is investigated which test strategy that should be used in order to perform accurate estimations of material parameters in multiaxial HCF criteria by use of as few laboratory tests as possible when different types of scatter are present, and when the cost to perform the fatigue tests is taken into consideration. It is shown that performing tests on few stress ratios located far away from each other is the best strategy, and that for tests performed in a high quality laboratory, scatter in specimen misalignment has an insignificant influence on the parameter estimation. In Papers C and D, the prediction accuracy for the probabilistic volume based Weakest Link (WL) model and the Volume method for the Probability of Fatigue (VPF) is investigated. A novel specimen design is suggested for investigation of the volume effect. Based on the results, the newly developed VPF is favoured for design purpose. In Paper D, the HCF post-processor AROMA-PF is also presented, and used for computation of pf for a real gas turbine compressor blade geometry. The behavior of the predicted fatigue probability curves is very different between WL and the VPF for low pf-values. In Paper E, a new method for fatigue probability assessment is presented. The classification of aleatory uncertainty type 1 and type 2 is also introduced. The suggested method is applied to a bladed disk in a gas turbine for computation of pf. The results show that the epistemic uncertainty in the modeling of the aero-forcing gives the major contribution to uncertainty in pf. QC 20160222 COMP 1...|$|R
