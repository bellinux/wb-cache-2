5|$|Although Clarke wrote little, {{due in part}} to {{her ideas}} about the role of a female composer, her work was {{recognised}} for its compositional skill. Most of her works have yet to be published (or have only recently been published), and were largely forgotten after she stopped composing. Scholarship and <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> compositions revived in 1976. The Rebecca Clarke Society was established in 2000 to promote the study and performance of her music.|$|E

5|$|Exact {{publication}} {{figures are}} unavailable for this book, but a first printing {{of one of}} Heyer's novels in the British Commonwealth often consisted of 65,000–75,000 copies, and each of her books generally sold over 500,000copies in paperback. As with Heyer's other popular fiction, this book was largely ignored by contemporary critics; only after her death did they begin to take more <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> work.|$|E
5|$|In April 1770, Maria Theresa's {{youngest}} daughter, Maria Antonia, married Louis, Dauphin of France, {{by proxy}} in Vienna. Maria Antonia's education was neglected, {{and when the}} French showed an <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>her,</b> her mother went about educating her {{as best she could}} about the court of Versailles and the French. Maria Theresa kept up a fortnightly correspondence with Maria Antonia, now called Marie Antoinette, in which she often reproached her for laziness and frivolity and scolded her for failing to conceive a child.|$|E
5|$|Makinti Napanangka began {{painting}} Contemporary Indigenous Australian art at Kintore in the mid-1990s, {{encouraged by}} a community art project. <b>Interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> work developed quickly, {{and she is}} now represented in most significant Australian public art galleries, including the National Gallery of Australia. A finalist in the 2003 Clemenger Contemporary Art Award, Makinti won the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award in 2008.

5|$|She bequeathed most of {{her money}} to her Society. During Fortune's lifetime, some of the Fraternity members had {{expressed}} concerns {{with regard to the}} organisation becoming a personality cult revolving around her, and so following her death they did not encourage an <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> biography. Members of the society have alleged that her successor destroyed {{most of her}} diaries, correspondences, and photographs. However, a number of her books would be published posthumously, among them The Cosmic Doctrine, which appeared in 1949, and her novel Moon Magic, published in 1956.|$|E
5|$|Barbauld's {{career as}} a poet ended {{abruptly}} in 1812 {{with the publication of}} Eighteen Hundred and Eleven, which criticised Britain's participation in the Napoleonic Wars. She was shocked by the vicious reviews it received and published nothing else in her lifetime. Her reputation was further damaged when many of the Romantic poets she had inspired in the heyday of the French Revolution turned against her in their later, more conservative years. Barbauld was remembered only as a pedantic children's writer in the nineteenth century, and largely forgotten in the twentieth, but the rise of feminist literary criticism in the 1980s renewed <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> works and restored her place in literary history.|$|E
5|$|Born about 1339, Elizabeth was the {{daughter}} of Ban StephenII of Bosnia, the head of the House of Kotromanić. Her mother, Elizabeth of Kuyavia, {{was a member of the}} House of Piast and grandniece of King Władysław I of Poland. The Hungarian queen dowager Elizabeth of Poland was first cousin once removed of Elizabeth's mother. After her daughter-in-law Margaret succumbed to the Black Death in 1349, Queen Elizabeth expressed <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> young kinswoman, having in mind a future match for her widowed and childless son, King LouisI of Hungary. She insisted on immediately bringing the girl to her court in Visegrád for fostering. Despite her father's initial reluctance, Elizabeth was sent to the dowager's court.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, {{a survey}} {{conducted}} for the Library of Congress and the Book-of-the-Month Club asked club members what the most influential book in the respondent's life was. Rand's Atlas Shrugged was the second most popular choice, after the Bible. Rand's books continue to be widely sold and read, with over 29million copies sold as of 2013 (with about 10% of that total purchased for free distribution to schools by the Ayn Rand Institute). In 1998, Modern Library readers voted Atlas Shrugged the 20th century's finest work of fiction, followed by The Fountainhead in second place, Anthem in seventh, and We the Living eighth; none of the four appeared on the critics' list. Although Rand's influence has been greatest in the United States, there has been international <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> work. Rand's work continues {{to be among the}} top sellers among books in India.|$|E
5|$|In July 2009, {{the song}} was offered as a free {{download}} on Kesha's MySpace page for over a month before its official sale release. The song was later released to iTunes on August 7, 2009, and on August 25, 2009, in the United States. Barry Weiss of RCA/Jive Label Group relied on a similar marketing scheme to that of Britney Spears' in 1999 when choosing to give the song away for free. The song's marketing relied heavily on radio once she had achieved a strong online interest, but its radio release was delayed until October in order to capitalize on social media's <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>her.</b> After spreading the song quickly topped iTunes charts.|$|E

5|$|Makeba married Carmichael in March 1968; {{this caused}} her {{popularity}} in the US to decline markedly. Conservatives came to regard her as a militant and an extremist, an image which alienated much of her fanbase. Her performances were cancelled and her coverage in the press declined despite her efforts to portray her marriage as apolitical. White American audiences stopped supporting her, and the US government took an <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> activities. The Central Intelligence Agency began following her, and placed hidden microphones in her apartment; the Federal Bureau of Investigation also placed her under surveillance. While {{she and her husband}} were travelling in the Bahamas, she was banned from returning to the US, and was refused a visa. As a result, the couple moved to Guinea, where Carmichael changed his name to Kwame Touré. Makeba did not return to the US until 1987.|$|E
5|$|Nancy was favorably {{impressed}} with Houston's land sales pitch, {{but not so}} {{impressed with}} his <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> daughter. She {{and others in the}} family were concerned about his reputation as a hard-drinking carouser with a proclivity for profanity, who was 26 years older than Margaret and twice married. Several weeks of love letters had been exchanged between Margaret and Houston by the time he proposed marriage that summer of 1839, presenting her with his image carved on a brooch. In an effort to assuage the family's opposition to the union, Houston spent several weeks in the Lea home in Alabama.|$|E

5|$|Since 1994, Brant {{has been}} honored as a Person of National Historic Significance in Canada. She was long ignored or disparaged by historians of the United States, but {{scholarly}} <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> {{increased in the}} late 20th century. She has sometimes been controversial, criticized for being pro-British {{at the expense of}} the Iroquois. But the Iroquois primarily allied with the British. Known to have been a devout Anglican, she is commemorated on April 16 in the calendar of the Anglican Church of Canada and the Episcopal Church (USA). No portraits of her are known to exist; an idealized likeness is featured on a statue in Kingston and on a Canadian stamp issued in 1986.|$|E

They develop a friendship in which both Nell and Brooke hold secret admiration and love for the other, but are unable to express it because of social conventions. Brooke also desires to lose his virginity because he feels that being a virgin is disgraceful. Because he cannot convince Nell or any of several other women to succumb to his wooing, he loses it in a homosexual encounter with a boyhood friend, Denham Russell-Smith.|$|E
