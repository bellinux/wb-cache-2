25|$|Up-slope fog or <b>hill</b> <b>fog</b> forms when winds blow air up a slope (called {{orographic}} lift), adiabatically cooling {{it as it}} rises, {{and causing}} the moisture in it to condense. This often causes freezing fog on mountaintops, where the cloud ceiling would not otherwise be low enough.|$|E
25|$|The {{relatively}} low height {{of most of}} the fells means that, while snow is expected during the winter, they can be free of snow at any time of the year. Normally, significant snow fall only occurs between November and April. On average, snow falls on Helvellyn 67 days per year. During the year, valleys typically experience 20 days with snow falling, a further 200 wet days, and 145 dry days. <b>Hill</b> <b>fog</b> is common at any time of year, and the fells average only around 2.5 hours of sunshine per day, increasing to around 4.1 hours per day on the coastal plains.|$|E
5000|$|Visibility: This place often enjoys good visibility, {{although}} <b>hill</b> <b>fog</b> sometimes {{restricts the}} visibility.|$|E
50|$|The dryness {{is marked}} in the plains {{than in the}} hills. During the south- west monsoons seasons the sky is heavily clouded to over cast. Winds are {{generally}} light to moderate receiving during the south-west monsoon season, when they are stronger particularly on <b>hills.</b> <b>Fogs</b> occur occasionally in the valleys in the cold season.|$|R

50|$|When {{there is}} a slight {{westerly}} wind, it can sometimes bring about an advection-induced <b>hill</b> <b>fog</b> on the saddle south of the village (in the training ground area) if moist air flowing from the Schielenbach condenses once it is lifted up. The village itself is not usually affected by this.|$|E
50|$|The Dartmoor National Park is {{notorious for}} being a {{difficult}} environment in which to navigate, especially if visibility is poor. The moor often experiences extensive <b>hill</b> <b>fog,</b> or 'clag' as it is locally known, which combined with the absence of many linear features (such as walls, paths, fences, forest edges) provides a challenging test {{for even the most}} confident navigator.|$|E
50|$|Especially in the colder months (October to January) {{there are}} high {{variations}} in temperature from day to night. Due to Oudomxay's location between <b>hills</b> and mountains, <b>fog</b> covers the town from evening to morning. In {{the course of the}} day, the fog starts to dissolve, so that in the cool season, mornings are brisk.|$|R

5000|$|The fell {{is prone}} to dense <b>hill</b> <b>fog</b> and fierce winds. A shrieking noise induced by the Helm Wind is a {{characteristic}} of the locality. It can be an inhospitable place {{for much of the}} year. In ancient times it was known as [...] "Fiends Fell" [...] and believed to be the haunt of evil spirits. St Augustine is said to have blessed the hill when he arrived here on his travels so it became known as Cross Fell in the Christian tradition, although it has been speculated that the fell became known as Cross Fell ("cross" [...] meaning [...] "angry") because of the evil spirits.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 June 1944, an American Air Force B-17 bomber {{crashed into}} Cave <b>Hill</b> during heavy <b>fog,</b> killing all ten crew instantly. The {{incident}} inspired Richard Attenborough's film, Closing the Ring. Some {{scenes of the}} film were shot on Cave Hill. The site of the crash is easily accessed via Carr's Glen Country Park where the field, known locally as 'The Bomb hole Field' remains entirely open to public.|$|R
5000|$|For the Apollo lunar missions, the restartable J-2 {{engine in}} the third (S-IVB) stage of the Saturn V rocket {{performed}} TLI. This particular TLI burn lasted approximately 350 seconds, providing 3.05 to 3.25 km/s (10,000 to 10,600 ft/s) of delta-v, {{at which point the}} spacecraft was traveling at approximately 10.4 km/s (34150 ft/s) relative to the Earth. [...] The Apollo 8 TLI was spectacularly observed from the Hawaiian Islands in the pre-dawn sky south of Waikiki, photographed and reported in the papers the next day. [...] In 1969, the Apollo 10 pre-dawn TLI was visible from Cloncurry, Australia. [...] It was described as resembling car headlights coming over a <b>hill</b> in <b>fog,</b> with the spacecraft appearing as a bright comet with a greenish tinge.|$|R
25|$|Arthur's Seat plays a {{prominent}} role in Scottish writer James Hogg's 1824 novel The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner. Robert and George Colwan, two feuding brothers, are caught in a fog atop Arthur's Seat and witness what could be interpreted as a Brocken spectre, a strange phenomenon of the light, which causes George to believe that he is seeing a ghost. In the confusion, Robert nearly kills George, but they both escape {{to the bottom of the}} <b>hill</b> as the <b>fog</b> begins to clear.|$|R
50|$|During {{an early}} morning {{practice}} session for the 1927 TT, Archie Birkin was killed instantly when he swerved to avoid a fish-van travelling to Peel and collided with a wall at Rhencullen. The corner in Kirk Michael on the A3 primary road where the accident occurred was renamed 'Birkin's Bend.' From 1928 practice sessions for the TT races and Manx Grand Prix were held on closed-roads. During the first lap of the 1934 Isle of Man TT Lightweight race Syd Crabtree, {{the winner of the}} 1929 TT, crashed in heavy <b>hill</b> <b>fog</b> on the Mountain section of the course at Stonebreakers Hut and was killed. For the 1935 TT races two motorcycle-equipped Travelling Marshals were employed to search for missing riders, particularly in poor weather conditions on the Mountain section of the Course. After a fatal crash by Doug Pirie, in poor visibility caused by mountain mist and fog near to the 33rd Milestone during the 1935 Lightweight TT race, races were delayed or postponed to the next day until the weather improved. The first evening practice session was introduced for the 1937 Isle of Man TT which continue to this day.|$|E
5000|$|This is a mountainous island having many cypress {{trees on}} its lower slopes. [...] "On its heights, above the trees, stands a simple stage, {{which has been}} used for {{performances}} of every kind - circuses, slapsticks, and High Tragedy - since the beginning of known time". By a consequence of the island's location, its Theatre [...] "is every three days shrouded in a mist that blows from the southeast", surrounding the <b>hill,</b> and both <b>fog</b> and Theatre are illuminated by [...] "tiny flames" [...] therein.|$|R
25|$|Wartime {{conditions}} emphasised {{the need}} for an airport. On 1 April 1940, a military air base, RAAF Station Canberra, was established on a flat plain between Canberra and Queanbeyan. Later, this was renamed RAAF Fairbairn in memory of the Minister for Air, James V. Fairbairn, who was killed with a number of other ministers and officials when an aircraft crashed into a nearby <b>hill</b> in dense <b>fog</b> on 13 August 1940. Canberra Airport was constructed in the 1960s; the military base and commercial airport share the same runway.|$|R

5000|$|The Battle of Austerlitz saw Miloradovich {{in charge}} of the Russian part of a Russian-Austrian {{infantry}} column (2,875 out of 11,795 men), one of the four columns placed on Pratzen Heights, which had been abandoned by the French. Another, larger part of the column was under Austrian command; the close presence of Kutuzov somewhat mitigated the perils of divided command. Tsar Alexander ordered this column to move before others were deployed; Kutuzov, unable to oppose the tsar, ordered Miloradovich to advance across the Goldbach Stream to Kobylnice, disregarding enemy action and difficult terrain. <b>Hills</b> and <b>fog</b> obstructed the view, and the column marched straight into the bulk of the French armies. Soult's troops mauled the mixed column and Miloradovich retreated. Alexander summoned his brother Constantine for help (although an alternative account by Bowden and Duffy asserts that Miloradovich contacted Constantine himself). Contrary to the popular view that [...] "he was almost the only Russian general who obtained any advantage over the French" [...] at Austerlitz, General Karl Wilhelm von Toll contested Miloradovich's actions, asserting that his column was the first to fall back and that it was Bagration, not Miloradovich, who saved the allied troops from annihilation.|$|R
50|$|In 1938, Husayni was exiled and in 1939 fled to Iraq {{where he}} {{took part in the}} Rashid Ali al-Gaylani coup. He moved to Egypt in 1946, but {{secretly}} returned to Palestine to lead the Army of the Holy War in January 1948. Husayni was killed while personally reconnoitring an area of Qastal <b>Hill</b> shrouded by <b>fog,</b> {{in the early hours of}} 8 April 1948. His forces later captured al-Qastal from the Haganah, which had occupied the village at the start of Operation Nachshon six days earlier with a force of about 100 men. They retreated to the Jewish settlement of Motza. Palmach troops recaptured the village on the night of 8-9 April, losing 18 men in the attack; most of the houses were blown up and the hill became a command post. Huseyni's death was a factor in the loss of morale among his forces.|$|R
50|$|In Canada, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent {{established}} the first semaphore line in North America. In operation by 1800, it ran {{between the city}} of Halifax {{and the town of}} Annapolis in Nova Scotia, and across the Bay of Fundy to Saint John and Fredericton in New Brunswick. In addition to providing information on approaching ships, the Duke used the system to relay military commands, especially as they related to troop discipline. The Duke had envisioned the line reaching as far as the British garrison at Quebec City; however, the many <b>hills</b> and coastal <b>fog</b> meant the towers needed to be placed relatively close together to ensure visibility. The required labour to build and continually man so many stations taxed the already stretched-thin British military and there is doubt the New Brunswick line was ever in operation. With the exception of the towers around Halifax harbour, the system was abandoned shortly after the Duke's departure in August 1800.|$|R
60|$|As I {{continued}} to sit upon the dump, I began {{to observe that}} this sea was not so level as at first sight it appeared to be. Away in the extreme south, a little <b>hill</b> of <b>fog</b> arose against the sky above the general surface, and as it had already caught the sun it shone on the horizon like the topsails of some giant ship. There were huge waves, stationary, as it seemed, like waves in a frozen sea; and yet, as I looked again, I was not sure but they were moving after all, with a slow and august advance. And while I was yet doubting, a promontory of the hills some four or five miles away, conspicuous by a bouquet of tall pines, was in a single instant overtaken and swallowed up. It reappeared in a little, with its pines, but this time as an islet and only to be swallowed up once more and then for good. This set me looking nearer, and I saw that in every cove {{along the line of}} mountains the fog was being piled in higher and higher, as though by some wind that was inaudible to me. I could trace its progress, one pine tree first growing hazy and then disappearing after another; although sometimes there was none of this forerunning haze, but the whole opaque white ocean gave a start and swallowed a piece of mountain at a gulp. It was to flee these poisonous fogs that I had left the seaboard, and climbed so high among the mountains. And now, behold, here came the fog to besiege me in my chosen altitudes, and yet came so beautifully that my first thought was of welcome.|$|R
