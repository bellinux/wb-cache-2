5|$|Because of his {{leadership}} at Yarmouk, Khalid ibn al-Walid {{is considered one}} of the finest generals in history and his use of mounted warriors throughout the battle showed just <b>how</b> <b>well</b> <b>he</b> understood the potential strengths and weaknesses of his mounted troops. His mobile guard moved quickly from one point to another, always changing the course of events wherever they appeared, and then just as quickly galloping away to change the course of events elsewhere on the field.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{signing a}} {{contract}} with the Yankees, Wensloff spent the 1943 season on the Yankees' major league roster. During spring training, Yankees manager Joe McCarthy had heard impressive things about Wensloff, though he had not seen him pitch often. Wensloff made his major league debut for the Yankees on May 2, 1943 against the Washington Senators. In his debut, the second game of a doubleheader, he allowed four earned runs and seven hits in eight innings as the Yankees lost, 41. He won his first game in his next pitching appearance on May 7, 1943 against the Philadelphia Athletics, allowing no walks and six hits in a 62 victory. By the end of June, he had six complete games in his first six starts. However, he was not receiving the publicity other rookies were, such as pitcher Jesse Flores, and had four wins and four losses despite <b>how</b> <b>well</b> <b>he</b> had been pitching.|$|E

5000|$|Benteke then scored Villa's fourth goal in a 4-1 League Cup {{win over}} Norwich City at Carrow Road. Benteke further {{added to his}} {{impressive}} start in Premier League football by scoring two goals in Villa's 3-1 win against Liverpool at Anfield on 15 December. In addition to the two goals, he also assisted Villa's second goal with a back-heel to Andreas Weimann. Paul Lambert said afterwards that 'Benteke has been unbelievable', after already stating midweek (post-Norwich) that 'you run out {{of things to say}} about the guy, <b>how</b> <b>well</b> <b>he's</b> performing and <b>how</b> young he is'. Around Christmas time, Tottenham Hotspur manager André Villas-Boas was reportedly interested in signing Benteke, referring to him as the season's [...] "surprise package".|$|R
5000|$|The Cardinals had 66 {{players in}} camp before 11 {{were sent to}} minor league camp on March 13, {{including}} three on the 40-man roster, and eight non-roster invitees. Among those sent down was left-handed pitcher Marco Gonzales (40-man), who still is working his way back from Tommy John surgery that he had about 11 months ago. Gonzales has been working behind the scenes with a few bullpen sessions during Spring Training, and it's possible he could wrap up his recovery {{by the end of}} May. [...] "Once Marco gets healthy, it's just a matter of <b>how</b> <b>well</b> <b>he's</b> able to execute his pitches," [...] Matheny said of the left-hander's potential return to the Cardinals.|$|R

25|$|In 1236, Al-Nafis {{moved to}} Egypt to teach {{jurisprudence}} in Cairo at al-Masruriyya (Arabic: المدرسة المسرورية). His name is found among {{those of other}} scholars, which gives insight into <b>how</b> <b>well</b> <b>he</b> was regarded {{in the study and}} practice of religious law. He wrote Kitab al-Shamil fi ‘l-Sina’a al-Tibbiyya (Comprehensive Book in the Art of Medicine) around his 30s. It comprised 300 volumes of notes, but only 80 of these were published. His writings are cataloged in many libraries around the world, including the Cambridge University Library, the Bodleian Library, and the Lane Medical Library at Stanford University.|$|E
25|$|During the 2004 season, Mattner {{was seen}} to improve {{in a number of}} areas – {{averaging}} eleven disposals and playing 16 matches for the year. Midway through a disappointing season for the team (where the Crows missed the finals), new coach Neil Craig gave Mattner more opportunity than previous coach Ayres, which helped Mattner grow as a player, another feature becoming noticeable was his run through the midfield. His new coach also played him more through the wing than Gary Ayres did, giving him more opportunity as a player. At that time, he had a career equaling 21 disposals in a game against Melbourne, and failed to miss a match after his inclusion in Round 7 which shows <b>how</b> <b>well</b> <b>he</b> was performing.|$|E

The atmosphere {{on and off the field}} was emotionally electric. Bodyline was freely discussed. In the background the crowd, lusting for more blood and guts, stirred the embers of controversy chanting for 'Lillee, Lillee'.|$|E
25|$|As mayor, Rendell {{inherited}} massive fiscal problems. The {{state legislature}} established a fiscal oversight board {{to monitor the}} City of Philadelphia's fiscal issues. During his career as mayor, Rendell cut a $250 million deficit, balanced Philadelphia's budget and oversaw five consecutive years of budget surpluses, reduced business and wage taxes for four consecutive years, implemented new revenue-generating initiatives, and dramatically improved services to Philadelphia neighborhoods. He was given the nickname “Philadelphia’s Renaissance or Revival” because of <b>how</b> <b>well</b> <b>he</b> did with the budget. He also appointed Philadelphia's first ever Latino deputy mayors, Benjamin Ramos and Manuel Ortiz. Rendell's cost-cutting policies brought him strong opposition from labor unions; however, he was re-elected in 1995, defeating Republican Joe Rocks with 80% of the vote.|$|E
25|$|He {{made his}} debut for Manchester City in the 2–1 defeat to Hull City. Three days later, {{he made his}} first start for City against Bolton Wanderers, where he {{assisted}} Emmanuel Adebayor through a long ball in the 2–0 victory. He scored his first goal for the club against Burnley in their 6–1 win on 3 April 2010. On 9 June 2010, Vieira agreed to a one-year extension to his contract, which kept him at Eastlands until the summer of 2011. On 11 September 2010, he started his first game in his second season for the club and went on to score the equalizing goal against Blackburn Rovers before being substituted in the 65th minute. On 18 January 2011, he scored his second goal of the season in Manchester City's 4–2 third round replay against Leicester City. This was his 50th appearance in the competition. He continued his good run in the FA Cup by scoring the first two goals, during their 5–0 win in the Fourth round replay against Notts County and was awarded Man of the Match honours. He was praised for <b>how</b> <b>well</b> <b>he</b> linked up with Aleksandar Kolarov. Vieira also scored in the Premier League on 3 April 2011 against Sunderland, having come on as a substitute for Adam Johnson in the 66th minute. He scored no less than a minute later, having touched the ball into the goal. He made a late substitute appearance in May 2011, as Manchester City won the FA Cup with a 1–0 win over Stoke City at Wembley Stadium.|$|E
5000|$|Todd Gilchrist of The Wrap said, [...] "Ultimately, it’s {{hard to look}} at {{the film}} from any sort of non-fan {{perspective}} and not see it as less than hagiography - a tribute to Bieber’s success, and a complimentary portrait of <b>how</b> <b>well</b> <b>he’s</b> supposedly dealt with it." [...] Matt Joseph of We Got This Covered concluded that, [...] "Even if it doesn't ask all the right questions or provide the answers we're looking for, the film is a perfectly harmless piece of work that will send fangirls the world over into a tizzy and entertain those who still haven't fully hopped onto the Belieber train." [...] Pamela McClintock of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that [...] "many of Bieber's fans are staying away. Rivals question why Open Road—owned by giant exhibitors Regal and AMC—decided to open Believe on Christmas, the most crowded time of the year." ...|$|R

500|$|Khalid's elite light cavalry, the Mobile guard, {{acted as}} {{the core of the}} Muslim cavalry during the {{invasion}} of Syria. It was composed of highly trained and seasoned soldiers, the majority of whom had been under Khalid's standard during his Arabian and Persian campaigns. Muslim cavalry was a light cavalry force armed with 5 meter long lances. They could charge at an incredible speed and would usually employ a common tactic of Kar wa far literary meaning [...] "engage-disengage", or in modern term: “hit-and-run.” They would charge on enemy flanks and rear, their maneuverability making them very effective against heavily armored Byzantine and Sassanid cataphracts. Khalid's famous flanking charge {{on the final day of}} the Battle of Yarmouk stands as testimony to just <b>how</b> <b>well</b> <b>he</b> understood the potentials and strengths of his mounted troops.|$|E
500|$|In his Life of Samuel Johnson Boswell {{referred}} to Johnson as 'Dr. Johnson' {{so often that}} he would always be known as such, even though he hated being called such. Boswell's emphasis on Johnson's later years shows him too often as merely an old man discoursing in a tavern to a circle of admirers. Although Boswell, a Scotsman, was a close companion and friend to Johnson during many important times of his life, {{like many of his}} fellow Englishmen Johnson had a reputation for despising Scotland and its people. Even during their journey together through Scotland, Johnson [...] "exhibited prejudice and a narrow nationalism". Hester Thrale, in summarising Johnson's nationalistic views and his anti-Scottish prejudice, said: [...] "We all know <b>how</b> <b>well</b> <b>he</b> loved to abuse the Scotch, & indeed to be abused by them in return." ...|$|E
500|$|McBride {{was born}} in Chicago, where {{he worked as a}} newsboy from the age of six. His first real job was for {{publishing}} tycoon William Randolph Hearst's organization in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston and Chicago. He moved to Cleveland in 1913, {{when he was in his}} mid-twenties, to be circulation manager for the Cleveland News. It was a time when circulation battles over newsstands and street corners often turned violent. He started with the News on a $10,000 salary ($ in today's dollars) and was charged with organizing the paper's newsboys. [...] "This meant choosing strong young men comfortable fighting with fists, clubs, knives, chains and, when they could get them, handguns," [...] author Ted Schwarz wrote. [...] "They were the business equivalent of the street gang, and McBride's salary depended on <b>how</b> <b>well</b> <b>he</b> organized his newsboys to avoid losing their corners to one or more violent rivals." ...|$|E

500|$|Holloway had a 54-year {{recording}} career, {{beginning in}} the age of acoustic recording, and ending in the era of the stereophonic LP. He mainly recorded songs from musicals and revues, and he recited many monologues on various subjects. [...] Most prominent among his recordings (aside from his participation in recordings of My Fair Lady) are those of three series of monologues that he made at intervals throughout his career. They featured Sam Small, Albert Ramsbottom, and historical events such as the Battle of Hastings, Magna Carta and the Battle of Trafalgar. In all, his discography runs to 130 recordings, spanning the period 1924 to 1978. [...] A review in The Gramophone of one of his 1957 albums containing recordings of his old [...] "concert party" [...] songs commented, [...] "what a fine voice he has and <b>how</b> <b>well</b> <b>he</b> can use it– diction, phrasing, range and the interpretative insight of the artist".|$|E
500|$|Guest actor Tom Noonan, {{who played}} the killer John Lee Roche, {{recalled}} filming the scene in which his character is introduced, playing basketball in prison. Noonan, a capable basketball player, was asked to [...] "downplay" [...] <b>how</b> <b>well</b> <b>he</b> could play; although he regretted {{not being able to}} play against David Duchovny, who had played basketball for Princeton University. Episode writer Vince Gilligan and director Rob Bowman assert that Duchovny's successful basketball shot in this scene was filmed in just one take, without special effects. While the episode was the eighth produced in the season, it was the tenth aired, having been delayed to free up production resources for the two part episodes [...] "Tunguska" [...] and [...] "Terma". The episode's climactic scene was filmed in a [...] "bus graveyard" [...] in Surrey, British Columbia, a location which had been scouted months previously with the intention of eventually including it in an episode of the series; although filming at the location did not even last a full day despite the long wait to use it.|$|E
500|$|Much {{like other}} sandbox games, the player uses melee attacks, guns, and {{explosives}} {{to fight the}} opposing forces, and can run, climb buildings, jump across rooftops, or use vehicles to navigate the city. Crackdown features a series of character-based skills that can be upgraded to increase specific traits {{that can be used}} in combat, driving, or on-foot agility. These skills include: [...] "Agility", which increases the Agent's ability to jump, run, and swim; [...] "Driving", affecting <b>how</b> <b>well</b> <b>he</b> can handle a vehicle and uprades it [...] "Explosives", which affects the power and range of explosive weapons and explosive power [...] "Strength" [...] that increases the Agent's strength, namely by increasing his ability to lift and throw, as well as how hard he can strike an opponent and increses health and [...] "Firearms", which improves the character's aptitude with weapons. Crackdowns skills make few concessions to realism: character abilities are similar to those of comic book superheroes or cartoon characters. This concept is further highlighted by the ink-like outlines drawn around in-game characters.|$|E

60|$|Saint-Eustache, {{to defend}} himself against my {{delicate}} imputation, and to show <b>how</b> <b>well</b> acquainted <b>he</b> was with Bardelys, plunged at once into a thousand details of that gentleman's magnificence. He described his suppers, his retinue, his equipages, his houses, his chateaux, his favour with the King, his successes with the fair sex, and I know not what besides--in all of which I confess that even to me {{there was a certain}} degree of novelty. Roxalanne listened with an air of amusement that showed <b>how</b> <b>well</b> she read him. Later, when I found myself alone with her by the river, whither we had gone after the repast and the Chevalier's reminiscences were at an end, she reverted to that conversation.|$|R
500|$|One of Busch's notable {{stories is}} Der Virtuos (1865), which {{describes}} {{the life of}} a pianist who plays privately for an excited listener. Satirizing the self-publicizing artist's attitude and his overblown adoration, it varies from Busch's other stories as each scene does not contain prose, but is defined with music terminology, such as [...] "Introduzione", [...] "Maestoso" [...] and [...] "Fortissimo vivacissimo". As the scenes increase in tempo, each part of his body and lappet run around. The penultimate scene again depicts the pianist's movements, with score sheets floating above the grand piano on which musical notes are dancing. Over the years graphic artists have been fascinated by Der Virtuos. August Macke, in a letter to gallery owner Herwarth Walden, described Busch as the first Futurist, stating <b>how</b> <b>well</b> <b>he</b> captured time and movement. Similar pioneering scenes are in Bilder zur Jobsiade (1872). Job fails to answer rather easy questions set by twelve clergy, who shake their heads in synchronicity. Each scene is a movement study that presages Eadweard Muybridge's photography. Muybridge began his work in 1872, not released until 1893.|$|E
500|$|Cooper's {{ability to}} project his {{personality}} onto his characters {{played an important}} part in his appearing natural and authentic on screen. Actor John Barrymore said of Cooper, [...] "This fellow is the world's greatest actor. He does without effort what the rest of us spend our lives trying to learn—namely, to be natural." [...] Charles Laughton, who played opposite Cooper in Devil and the Deep agreed, [...] "In truth, that boy hasn't the least idea <b>how</b> <b>well</b> <b>he</b> acts ... He gets at it from the inside, from his own clear way of looking at life." [...] William Wyler, who directed Cooper in two films, called him a [...] "superb actor, a master of movie acting". In his review of Cooper's performance in The Real Glory, Graham Greene wrote, [...] "Sometimes his lean photogenic face seems to leave everything to the lens, but there is no question here of his not acting. Watch him inoculate the girl against cholera—the casual jab of the needle, and the dressing slapped on while he talks, as though a thousand arms had taught him where to stab and he doesn't have to think anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|In a September 2008 {{interview}} with BBC Radio 4, Ray Davies said {{of a possible}} reunion, [...] "There is a desire to do it", but that he wouldn't participate {{if it were a}} nostalgia act: [...] "The thing that would make me decide 'yes' or 'no' would be whether or not we could do new songs". He added that the main barrier to the band getting back together was his brother's condition following his stroke. Two months later, he told the BBC that the band was beginning to write new material for a possible reunion, but failed to detail which members were involved. In an interview aired that December on the Biography Channel, Quaife rejected any possibility that he would take part in a reunion. That same month, Ray Davies spoke again about the possibility of performing with his brother: [...] "I suggested he do some low-key shows to see <b>how</b> <b>well</b> <b>he</b> can play. If we're going to play together again, we can't hit the road straight away with a big-time announcement.... But, if Dave feels good about it and there's good new material that we can write, it'll happen." ...|$|E

[...] In response Baba commented: [...] "There is a possibility to have another Yuri-style character again, but I think it’s important {{to listen to the}} fan’s voices," [...] Baba responded.
