The system is a grassroots network of carpoolers that collaborate to form rideshare for their commute to the <b>downtown</b> areas of <b>San</b> <b>Francisco,</b> Houston and Washington DC. Through the author’s experience with the system and personal attempts to deliver a rideshare network to the public, a framework of a greater casual carpool organization is presented...|$|R
50|$|Potrero Hill {{started as}} a Caucasian working-class {{neighborhood}} in the 1850s. Its central location attracted many working professionals during the dot-com era in the 1990s.

The northern boundary with Lower Nob Hill historically has been set at Geary Street.|$|E
25|$|One urban {{system that}} was not {{severely}} affected by the streetcar decline was the San Francisco Municipal Railway (MUNI) in San Francisco. Its five heavily used streetcar lines traveled for {{at least part of}} their routes through tunnels or otherwise reserved right-of-way, and thus could not be converted to bus lines. As a result, these lines, running PCC streetcars, continued in operation for several decades. When plans for stations in the double-decker Market Street Subway tunnel through <b>downtown</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco,</b> with BART on the lower level and MUNI on the upper level, required high platforms, it meant that the PCCs could not be used in them. Hence, MUNI ordered a fleet of new light rail vehicles, and Muni Metro began service in 1980.|$|E
25|$|The Caltrain Modernization Program will {{electrify}} {{the main}} line between San Francisco and the San Jose Tamien Station, allowing transition from diesel-electric locomotive power to fully electric rolling stock. Proponents say electrification would improve service times via faster acceleration, allow better scheduling and reduce air pollution and noise. Electrification would also allow future expansion to <b>downtown</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco.</b> Electrified vehicles require less maintenance, but electrification will increase required track maintenance by about the same dollar amount, at least initially. The plan calls to electrify the system between San Francisco 4th and King Street Station and San Jose Tamien Station. Originally scheduled for completion by 2020, the schedule had slipped {{after three months of}} construction to December 30, 2021 and then April 22, 2022. At that point, Caltrain plans to use electric multiple units and increase service to six trains per hour in each direction.|$|E
