This approach is not feasible if the target of interest is beyond the detection range of this surface equipment, for example because this target is located too far away or behind a highly conductive barrier. <b>Directional</b> borehole <b>radar</b> is an effective method in these cases. In this paper, we present experimental data of a <b>directional</b> borehole <b>radar</b> for UXO detection.

Furthermore, the sensor needs no battery and only small space to transfer electrical signals to optical signals. If the sensors are used as array elements of the <b>directional</b> borehole <b>radar,</b> we might accurately measure electric fields at several points. And we can determine directions of arrival waves with time delays and relative amplitude of signals received at the points. We did experiment that the sensor in a borehole is illuminated with a transmitter outside the borehole. Transmission between the transmitter and the electric field sensor in a borehole was measured, and we obtained array data set with the sensor. The array data was analyzed by cross-spectrum analysis, and time delay and relative amplitude among the array elements was estimated. In order to give theoretical results, we analyzed the dipole array in a borehole by Method of Moment (MoM). In the MoM, effect of scattered fields caused by cylindrical inhomogeneity around a borehole is included. The theoretical results gave good agreement with experimental results. This is because we could accurately measure electric fields with the optical modulator.

The miniaturized capacitive loaded Electromagnetic Band Gap (EBG) has been developed and introduced between the array elements to eliminate the problem.

GameSpot contributor Alex Navarro argued that despite not being the most graphically-advanced game available for the PS2 during its release, the game will impress players with Kawamoto's character designs and the protagonist Lau's cinematic flair. Joe Juba of Game Informer similarly enjoyed the game's character designs and action sequences, discovering within it a [...] "unique sense of style, reminiscent of Hong Kong cinema, [...] every aspect". The three writers' views somewhat differed for game's level designs.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the {{simulation}} {{and design of}} a <b>directional</b> borehole <b>radar.</b> In addition we discuss an imaging method for the radar system. The antenna system contains an electric dipole which is in one direction shielded by a cylindrical perfectly conducting reflector. The radiation pattern of the reflected wavefield is computed by first solving the integral equation. This equation combines the unknown electric surface current density on the reflector and the known incident field from the electric dipole. Once the electric surface current density is known, the radiation pattern {{of the system is}} computed using the integral representation over the reflector and the dipole. The radiation patterns for various configurations have been computed in order to find an optimal configuration. A prototype of the antenna system based on an optimal configuration has been built, and the directional radiation pattern has been measured in the plane perpendicular to the antenna system. The measurements were in good agreement with the computations. Subsequently a three dimensional imaging method for the borehole radar is presented. Here a deconvolution is carried out in the angular direction, making use of the computed radiation pattern. Some imaging results will be shown. Key Words.

40|$|International audienceThe {{dosimetry}} {{is one of}} {{the crucial}} techniques that are needed to assure personal safety and facilities security in the areas of high radioactivity as nuclear power plants or powerful experimental research infrastructure (LHC, XFEL, ITER). Until now, the common electronic dosimeters are based on the silicon diodes or field effect transistors what limits the measured dose value up to few Mrad, as the higher levels lead to the device saturation. The other techniques that allows for higher dose measurement (up to 100 Mrad and more) are based mostly on the variation of physic-chemical parameters of different materials but need the post measurement treatment of the sensor that has to be taken out of the monitored zone and use of the special equipment what makes the continuous measurement impossible. Moreover, in case of nuclear reactors the access to the radioactive zones is limited what leads to the measurement frequency in range of a few times per year. The solution that may overcome that problem is the use of the recently developed innovative concept of the passive sensors that are interrogated by the radar technique. Such a solution uses the small (millimeter sized) micro-resonators designed for the ultra high frequency (about 30 GHz) that are connected to the antenna and serve as its load. Any change of the resonant frequency of the resonator may be detected as the shift in the radar echo of the antenna. The sensor is interrogated by the <b>directional</b> <b>radar</b> and the reflected signal is analyzed. The associate transduction principle is that the resonator changes its resonant frequency due to the variation of the specific measured physical value like temperature, pressure or humidity.
