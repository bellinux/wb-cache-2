5|$|After {{earning his}} doctorate, Clough began his {{academic}} {{career as an}} assistant professor at Duke University in 1969. He joined the faculty at Stanford University in 1974 first as an associate professor and then later as full professor. In 1982, he joined the faculty of Virginia Tech as a professor of civil engineering and served as head of their Department of Civil Engineering for seven years. In 1990, Clough became dean of the Virginia Tech College of Engineering. Clough continued his research and instruction of graduate students at Virginia Tech in addition to his administrative responsibilities. Clough's research focused on <b>geotechnical</b> engineering, including earthquake studies, numerical analysis, soil structure interaction, in-situ testing, and underground openings. In 1993, he became provost and vice president for academic affairs at the University of Washington. Clough cofounded the United States Universities Council of <b>Geotechnical</b> Engineering Research (USUCGER), and served as the organization's first president during 1993.|$|E
5|$|Although it's {{believed}} that the San Jose Fault runs through campus, and <b>geotechnical</b> investigations have been conducted, there is uncertainty regarding its precise type and location. The CLA Building suffers from structural flaws, most notably, water intrusion. In 2005, the university {{filed a lawsuit against}} a contractor, for which it was compensated $13.3 million in an out-of-court settlement. Amid these concerns, on September 2010, the CSU Board of Trustees approved a proposal to have the building razed.|$|E
5|$|Another {{planning}} {{office was}} established in 1962, initially led by Erik Himle. The final plans for the route were passed by parliament in 1968, and construction started in 1971. The main contractors were Ingeniør Thor Furuholmen, Dipl.ing. Kaare Backer, NSB, Jernbaneanlegget Oslo Sentralstasjon and Ingeniørbygg. Consultants included Ingeniørene Bonde & Co., Peer Qvam's arkitektkontor and the Norwegian <b>Geotechnical</b> Institute.|$|E
5|$|Geology is {{the science}} and study of the solid and liquid matter that {{constitutes}} the Earth. The field of geology encompasses {{the study of the}} composition, structure, physical properties, dynamics, and history of Earth materials, and the processes by which they are formed, moved, and changed. The field is a major academic discipline, and is also important for mineral and hydrocarbon extraction, knowledge about and mitigation of natural hazards, some <b>Geotechnical</b> engineering fields, and understanding past climates and environments.|$|E
5|$|Barry Voight (born 1937) is an American geologist, volcanologist, author, and engineer. He is {{also the}} brother of actor Jon Voight and {{songwriter}} Chip Taylor, and the uncle of actress Angelina Jolie. After completing a five-year intensive dual-degree program at the University of Notre Dame, Voight became a teaching assistant there while pursuing his master's degree. He then studied at Cornell University for a year before transferring to Columbia University, where he earned his Ph.D. in geology in 1965. Voight worked {{as a professor of}} geology at several universities, including Pennsylvania State University, where he taught from 1964 until his retirement in 2005; he remains an emeritus professor there. He still conducts research, focusing on rock mechanics, plate tectonics, disaster prevention, and <b>geotechnical</b> engineering.|$|E
5|$|On January 28, 2011, DelDOT filed {{a lawsuit}} against bridge design firm Figg Bridge Engineers and subconsultant MACTEC Engineering and Consulting for <b>geotechnical</b> errors. In February 2011, DelDOT awarded George & Lynch an $11.6 million {{contract}} to build the approach roads to the new Indian River Inlet Bridge as well as to demolish the old bridge. A minor fire occurred {{on the north side of}} the bridge construction site; no damage was reported to the bridge structure. The north side of the bridge was finished in August 2011 when the form travelers were removed. Over 250 people were employed in the construction of the bridge.|$|E
5|$|Voight began {{teaching}} in 1961, {{serving as a}} teaching assistant at the University of Notre Dame while pursuing his master's degree in civil engineering. From 1961−1963, {{he served as a}} teaching assistant at Cornell and Columbia. In 1964, he joined the faculty at Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) as an assistant professor of geology, becoming a full professor of geology and <b>geotechnical</b> engineering in 1978. Voight taught at Penn State for more than four decades, retiring from teaching in June 2005 but continuing his research.|$|E
5|$|A {{budget was}} {{prepared}} by the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee (LOOC) in December 1989, and in April 1990, the Parliament of Norway passed a grant. In October, LOOC and Gjøvik Municipality made an agreement to share the ownership of the venue. The municipal council took the decision to build underground on 24 January 1991 and the main planning was contracted to Fortifikasjon. Main architects were Moe–Levorsen. A research group was created, which had four main tasks: ventilation, energy, fire and safety; the environment; rock mechanism and geology; and laws and regulations. The group also made marketing information to promote Norwegian underground technology internationally. In preparation for construction, drilling samples were taken and sent to SINTEF and the Norwegian <b>Geotechnical</b> Institute for testing. The rock is 800 to 1,100 million year-old gneiss which is well suited for creating caverns. Computer models were created, and estimates {{were based on the}} Q-method.|$|E
5|$|The Port of Miami Tunnel project {{involved}} {{the design and}} widening of the MacArthur Causeway by one lane in each direction {{leading up to the}} tunnel entrance, the relocation of Parrot Jungle Trail, and the reconstruction of roadways on Dodge Island. The tunnel itself has two side by side tubes carrying traffic underneath the cruise ship channel of the Government Cut shipping lane. Jacobs Engineering Group was responsible for the design of the roadways, Langan Engineering & Environmental Services was the <b>geotechnical</b> engineer, and Bouygues was the prime contractor for the tunnel project itself. Chosen due to their key involvement {{in the construction of the}} Channel Tunnel, a major tunnel in Europe, the selection of Bouygues was also met with controversy and protested by the Cuban exile community in Miami, due to the company's involvement with locally opposed construction projects in Cuba.|$|E
5|$|With his students, Voight has {{analyzed}} pyroclastic flows, volcanically induced seismicity, volcanic debris avalanches, and {{volcanic eruption}} prediction. Voight has {{also served as}} a consultant <b>geotechnical</b> engineer for dams, tunnels, and nuclear power plants, helping plan engineering projects in France, India, Ireland, Somalia, Papua New Guinea, Canada, and Turkey, {{as well as in the}} United States. Voight's research interests in lava dome collapses, stratovolcanoes, monitoring of active volcanoes, and pyroclastic flows have brought him to Iceland, Indonesia, the West Indies, Italy, and Chile. Combining his knowledge of engineering and geological concepts, Voight developed the widely used anelastic strain recovery (ASR) method for measuring stress on deep rock. With a team of geologists, he also derived the material failure forecast method (FFM), which predicts eruption times for volcanoes based on changes in the mountain's surrounding seismic and deformation data. He currently serves as a member of the United States Geological Survey's Volcano Hazards Response Team, and has responded to potentially eruptive volcanoes in Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Chile.|$|E

25|$|<b>Geotechnical</b> {{investigations}} are performed by <b>geotechnical</b> engineers or engineering geologists {{to obtain information}} on the physical properties of soil and rock around a site to design earthworks and foundations for proposed structures and for repair of distress to earthworks and structures caused by subsurface conditions. This type of investigation is called a site investigation. Additionally, <b>geotechnical</b> {{investigations are}} also {{used to measure the}} thermal resistivity of soils or backfill materials required for underground transmission lines, oil and gas pipelines, radioactive waste disposal, and solar thermal storage facilities. A <b>geotechnical</b> investigation will include surface exploration and subsurface exploration of a site. Sometimes, geophysical methods are used to obtain data about sites. Subsurface exploration usually involves soil sampling and laboratory tests of the soil samples retrieved.|$|E
25|$|CPT for <b>geotechnical</b> {{applications}} was standardized in 1986 by ASTM Standard D 3441 (ASTM, 2004). ISSMGE provides {{international standards}} on CPT and CPTU. Later ASTM Standards {{have addressed the}} use of CPT for various environmental site characterization and groundwater monitoring activities. For <b>geotechnical</b> soil investigations, CPT is more popular compared to SPT {{as a method of}} <b>geotechnical</b> soil investigation. Its increased accuracy, speed of deployment, more continuous soil profile and reduced cost over other soil testing methods. The ability to advance additional in situ testing tools using the CPT direct push drilling rig, including the seismic tools described above, are accelerating this process.|$|E

25|$|The {{university}} {{issues a}} quarterly journal called the Jordan Journal of Civil Engineering (JJCE). The journal is internationally peer-reviewed. Subjects covered include applications of civil rehabilatations, structural control, smart materials, earthquake engineering, <b>geotechnical</b> engineering and soil/rock mechanics, dam engineering, traffic and transportation engineering, water and environmental engineering, construction management and project planning, surveying and mapping, and infrastructures engineering, {{as well as}} numerical and analytical methods.|$|E
25|$|Identification of soil {{properties}} presents {{challenges to}} <b>geotechnical</b> engineers. Boundary conditions are often well defined in other branches of civil engineering, but unlike steel or concrete, the material properties {{and behavior of}} soil are difficult to predict due to its variability and limitation on investigation. Furthermore, soil exhibits nonlinear (stress-dependent) strength, stiffness, and dilatancy (volume change associated with application of shear stress), making studying soil mechanics all the more difficult.|$|E
25|$|Sediment {{transport}} {{is applied}} to solve many environmental, <b>geotechnical,</b> and geological problems. Measuring or quantifying sediment transport or erosion is therefore important for coastal engineering. Several sediment erosion devices have been designed in order to quantitfy sediment erosion (e.g., Particle Erosion Simulator (PES)). One such device, {{also referred to as}} the BEAST (Benthic Environmental Assessment Sediment Tool) has been calibrated in order to quantify rates of sediment erosion.|$|E
25|$|In October 1999, CRREL {{became a}} member of an {{umbrella}} organization of Corps of Engineers laboratories, called the Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC).

25|$|Geologists use a {{wide variety}} of methods to {{understand}} the Earth's structure and evolution, including field work, rock description, geophysical techniques, chemical analysis, physical experiments, and numerical modelling. In practical terms, geology is important for mineral and hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation, evaluating water resources, understanding of natural hazards, the remediation of environmental problems, and providing insights into past climate change. Geology, a major academic discipline, also plays a role in <b>geotechnical</b> engineering.|$|E
25|$|Geosynthetic clay liners, or GCLs, are an {{interesting}} juxtaposition of polymeric materials and natural soils. They are rolls of factory fabricated thin layers of bentonite clay sandwiched between two geotextiles or bonded to a geomembrane. Structural integrity of the subsequent composite is obtained by needle-punching, stitching or adhesive bonding. GCLs are used as a composite component beneath a geomembrane or by themselves in geoenvironmental and containment applications {{as well as in}} transportation, <b>geotechnical,</b> hydraulic, and many private development applications.|$|E
25|$|Geology gives {{insight into}} the history of the Earth, as it {{provides}} the primary evidence for plate tectonics, the evolutionary history of life, and past climates. In modern times, geology is commercially important for mineral and hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation and for evaluating water resources. It is publicly important for the prediction and understanding of natural hazards, the remediation of environmental problems, and for providing insights into past climate change. Geology plays a role in <b>geotechnical</b> engineering and is a major academic discipline.|$|E
