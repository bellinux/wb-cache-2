5|$|Although {{nothing is}} {{happening}} in this image, we associate the <b>figures</b> <b>with</b> tragedy, with death and mourning – with the classical reference in the painting's title. Iphigenia, Agamemnon's daughter, gave her life for her country when the goddess Artemis asked for it in exchange for favourable winds so that the Greek ships could sail to Troy. Bellette's melancholic painting might be supposed to portray Iphigenia's friends mourning her death.|$|E
5|$|England batted on {{for five}} minutes on the final morning, adding three runs in two overs before Yardley {{declared}} at 365/8, with Evans on 47 not out. Johnston had the pick of the bowling <b>figures,</b> <b>with</b> 4/95. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help {{to break up the}} wicket and make the surface more likely to spin.|$|E
50|$|The statues in the façade are as follows: {{immediately}} to the top left of the main entrance, on the first floor, is a statue of John Milton, while to the top right of the main door is a statue of William Shakespeare.To the right of these statues, between the windows on the south wing of the library, are a male <b>figure</b> <b>with</b> a book, representing Literature, and a female <b>figure</b> <b>with</b> a paintbrush, representing the Arts; while {{to the left of}} the statues of Milton and Shakespeare, between the windows on the north wing, are a female <b>figure</b> <b>with</b> a wheel, representing Spinning, and a male <b>figure</b> <b>with</b> a pair of compasses, representing Astronomy.|$|R

5|$|In June 2004, Trafford {{adopted a}} revised set of ward boundaries, and the ward of Talbot was {{replaced}} by the new ward of Gorse Hill. Re-aligning the 2001 census <b>figures</b> <b>with</b> the 2004 ward boundaries gives Stretford a population of 42,121.|$|E
5|$|Burial 67 {{was found}} in a cist under the second of five stucco floor levels in Northeast Plaza Structure 2. The {{skeleton}} was lying on its back with the head towards the north. The remains were poorly preserved but belonged to an adult. Of the skull only some dental remains were found. A ceramic plate had been placed under the head of the deceased and another plate was placed upon the knees. The plate was painted with four seated anthropomorphic <b>figures</b> <b>with</b> inclined head and wearing leather gloves with jaguar claws. The facial features of the figures are unusual. The bottom of the plate bears the image of a dancer. The ceramics date the burial to the Late Classic.|$|E

5|$|Drax's henchman Krebs {{is caught}} by Bond {{snooping}} through his room. Later, an attempted assassination by triggering a landslide nearly kills Bond and Brand, as they swim beneath the Dover cliffs. Drax takes Brand to London, where she discovers {{the truth about}} the Moonraker by comparing her own launch trajectory <b>figures</b> <b>with</b> those in a notebook picked from Drax's pocket. She is captured by Krebs, and finds herself captive in a secret radio homing station—intended to serve as a beacon for the missile's guidance system—in the heart of London. While she is being taken back to the Moonraker facility by Drax, Bond gives chase, but is also captured by Drax and Krebs.|$|E
5|$|During the 2001–02 WNCL, Ebsary {{played in}} all eight matches, {{and was given}} more responsibility. This season, she batted in seven innings and bowled 51 of a maximum {{possible}} 80 overs. In the first match of the season, she took 3/29 from 10 overs against the titleholders New South Wales, and she scored 51 in the fifth match against Victoria. Ebsary {{did not have a}} significant impact in the other matches, never taking more than one wicket per match or reaching double <b>figures</b> <b>with</b> the bat. She ended the season with 67 runs at 9.57 and six wickets at 30.83 at an economy rate of 3.62. South Australia won four of their eight matches and did not make the final.|$|E
5|$|England batted on {{for five}} minutes during the final morning, adding three runs in two overs before Yardley {{declared}} at 365/8, with Evans unbeaten on 47. Johnston had the pick of the bowling <b>figures,</b> <b>with</b> 4/95. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller {{at the start of}} the morning, which would help break up the wicket and make it more likely to spin. Bradman had done a similar thing during the previous Ashes series in Australia before setting England a target. The hosts needed to beat Australia to avoid a series defeat. Bradman elected to not have the pitch rolled at all, demonstrating his opinion that such a device would make the surface less favourable for batting.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, the {{province}} of Trento, Italy provided sculpted wooden figures and animals as well as utensils to create depictions of daily life. The scene featured seventeen <b>figures</b> <b>with</b> nine depicting the Holy Family, the Magi, and the shepherds. The nine figures were originally donated by Saint Vincent Pallotti for the nativity at Rome's Church of Sant'Andrea della Valle in 1842 and eventually {{found their way to}} the Vatican. They are dressed anew each year for the scene. The 2008 scene was set in Bethlehem with a fountain and a hearth representing regeneration and light. The same year, the Paul VI Audience Hall exhibited a nativity designed by Mexican artists.|$|E
5|$|In {{its debut}} week of 15 June 2009, the show topped the UK {{children}}'s TV viewing <b>figures</b> <b>with</b> 191,000 viewers. The first series reached a viewing peak of 50% of UK children aged 6–12, {{while the second}} was watched by 34% of UK children aged 6–12, or 1.6 million total. Throughout its run, the show routinely ranked {{at or near the}} top of the CBBC ratings, reaching a peak of 548,000 viewers for Episode 10 of Series 5.|$|E
5|$|In {{many of the}} works, {{including}} the original series, Warhol drastically simplified the gold medallion that appears on Campbell's Soup cans by replacing the paired allegorical <b>figures</b> <b>with</b> a flat yellow disk. In most variations, the only hint of three-dimensionality came from the shading on the tin lid. Otherwise the image was flat. The works with torn labels are perceived as metaphors {{of life in the}} sense that even packaged food must meet its end. They are often described as expressionistic.|$|E

Detectives Kima Greggs and Lester Freamon, as part of the major crimes unit, investigate Avon Barksdale's political donations and serve several key <b>figures</b> <b>with</b> subpoenas. Their work is shut down by Commissioner Ervin Burrell at Mayor Clarence Royce's request, and after being placed under stricter supervision within their unit, both Greggs and Freamon request and receive transfer to the homicide division.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Egyptians {{produced}} art {{to serve}} functional purposes. For over 3500 years, artists adhered to artistic forms and iconography that were {{developed during the}} Old Kingdom, following a strict set of principles that resisted foreign influence and internal change. These artistic standards—simple lines, shapes, and flat areas of color combined with the characteristic flat projection of <b>figures</b> <b>with</b> no indication of spatial depth—created a sense of order and balance within a composition. Images and text were intimately interwoven on tomb and temple walls, coffins, stelae, and even statues. The Narmer Palette, for example, displays figures that can also be read as hieroglyphs. Because of the rigid rules that governed its highly stylized and symbolic appearance, ancient Egyptian art served its political and religious purposes with precision and clarity.|$|E
5|$|The orchestral ritornello punctuates the {{movement}} for a third and last time, the upper strings playing the semiquaver <b>figures,</b> <b>with</b> the detached quavers on the beat in the oboes and off the beat in the alto recorders. It leads directly into the homophonic coda {{in the last seven}} bars of {{the movement}}. With the same orchestral pairings as the fugato episode, the sopranos joyously sing out the beginning of the second fugue theme below trilling recorders before joining the polyphony of the other voices—with a last emphatic sospirans figure in the basses—for the final exultant rendition of the text.|$|E

5|$|The {{striking}} {{scene has}} been used as the cover illustration for many books on topics both artistic and scientific. It has even spawned pastiches and parodies: the book cover of The Science of Discworld, by Terry Pratchett, Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen, is a tribute to the painting by artist Paul Kidby, who replaces Wright's <b>figures</b> <b>with</b> the book's protagonists. Shelagh Stephenson's play An Experiment with an Air Pump, inspired by the painting, was the joint winner of the 1997 Margaret Ramsay Award and had its premiere at the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester, in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Thirteen {{players have}} {{represented}} the U.S. in ODI matches, of whom nine played both games. Clayton Lambert has scored the most runs, with 39 runs {{at an average}} of 39.00; he also has the highest individual score for the country (39). Mark Johnson acted as wicket-keeper in all of U.S.'s fixtures and made one dismissal, catching Matthew Hayden for 23 off the bowling of Howard Johnson. Staple has claimed the most wickets in ODI matches for the U.S., having taken two, and holds the best bowling <b>figures,</b> <b>with</b> 2/76 (two wickets for seventy-six runs) against New Zealand. Staple is the only cricketer to captain the U.S. in ODIs.|$|E
5|$|Viewing {{figures of}} the seventh season of Degrassi: The Next Generation did not fare as well as {{previous}} seasons.

The season premiere achieved the highest <b>figures</b> <b>with</b> 585,000 viewers. This progressively dropped over the forthcoming weeks from 446,000 viewers on 28 January 2008, to 407,000 viewers on 11 February 2008, and continued to fall to 314,000 viewers over forthcoming weeks.|$|E
