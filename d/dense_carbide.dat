The five alloys were heated in synthetic air, maintained at 1200 degrees C during 50 h and then cooled. The mass gains were plotted versus time or according to (m x dm/dt=Kp-m x Kv) to specify the isothermal kinetic constants, or versus temperature to determine how oxidation acts during heating and oxide spallation occurs during cooling. Compared to the ternary alloys, the oxidation of the HfC reinforced alloys starts earlier but leads to lower mass gains during heating, the isothermal oxidation is faster and oxide spallation occurs later...|$|E

The relative density achievable increased with increasing pressure and ranged from 99 % at 4 MPa for ZrC 0. 5 to 93 % for stoichiometric ZrC at 100 MPa. The diminishing influence {{of pressure on}} the final density with increasing stoichiometry is attributed to two causes: the decreasing initial volume fraction of the plastically deforming Zr metal which leads to the earlier formation of a contiguous, stress shielding carbide skeleton and the larger molar volume shrinkage during reaction which leads to pore formation in the final stages. A numerical model of the creep densification of a dynamically evolving microstructure predicts densities that are consistent with observations and confirm that the availability of a soft metal is primarily responsible for the achievement of such elevated densification during RHP.

The {{fabrication}} {{conditions of}} <b>dense</b> silicon <b>carbide</b> (SiC) composites containing chopped Tyranno Si-Al-C (SA) fiber {{were examined in}} this work; SiC compacts containing SA fiber (mean lengths: 214, 394 and 706 µm) were hot-pressed at 1800 ºC for 30 min under a pressure of 31 MPa in Ar atmosphere. The fracture toughness of SiC composites with 40 mass % of SA fiber addition (sintering aid: 5 mol % Al 4 C 3) increased from 2. 8 up to 4. 7 MPa·m 1 / 2 as the fiber length increased from 214 to 706 µm. The enhanced fracture toughness of the SiC composites was attributed to the lowering of fiber orientation angle (i. e., the angle between the fiber length and direction perpendicular to the hot-pressing direction) to 5 ° with increasing fiber length. The fracture toughness of SiC composites could be further enhanced through the incorporation of SA fibers with a carbon interface (thickness: 100 nm) into the SiC matrix.

The conditions produce molten oxide which may provide a temporary resistance to rapid oxidation and may go some way to repair thermal shock cracks, however, {{at the same time the}} liquid is observed to attack the dense ceramic both chemically and mechanically. A reaction mechanism is suggested which involves dissolution of TaC in the oxide melt and a two step oxidation; first the reaction of TaC with oxygen to form Ta(O,C) and TaO x, resulting in dissolved dissociated carbon, followed by the reaction of dissolved carbon with oxygen to produce gas. This microstructural analysis of one of the candidate ultra-high temperature ceramic materials for hypersonic flight provides new insight into the mechanism of TaC oxidation and the role of the liquid oxide layer in acting not only as a protective layer to further oxidation, as is commonly reported, but also as a dynamic component that promotes erosion of the TaC surface and is a source of further oxygenation of the TaC surface. If the formation of the liquid phase can be better controlled and the reaction of the liquid phase with the matrix be slowed and stabilised, then the formation of a liquid phase at the surface of TaC may provide a key to designing materials that can withstand the rigours of hypersonic flight. © 2012, Springer...|$|R

The current cladding, a Zirconium-alloy, is quickly approaching the pinnacle of its ability to handle the increasing fuel load demands. Also, as evidenced by the incident at Fukushima, it reacted violently with water steam at high temperatures, which created hydrogen gas and lead to subsequent explosions. Therefore, the material leading the investigation to replace the alloy is silicon carbide. Silicon carbide has been processed and manufactured through several techniques; however, this study focuses on the development of silicon carbide through the use of the polymer infiltration and pyrolysis (PIP) technique. This technique utilizes a polymer precursor, AHPCS, in accordance with low temperature sintering to enhance the density of silicon carbide. This procedure is environmentally friendly and makes use of low temperature and pressure processing parameters.

Its splats had a uniform cemented shape, supported by a highly dense coating microstructure with enhanced mechanical splat adhesion. Additionally, the fully melted particles within this mix provided lower viscosity of the matrix liquid phase and higher splat impact by the HVOF gun, resulting in high bonding strength at the interface with no presence of delamination occurring at the coating/substrate interface. Such microstructural properties benefit a components ability to protect itself from wear, and erosion-corrosion.

Density measurements confirm near full density was achieved for all compositions, with the highest density measured in the HfC-contained samples, all consolidated without sintering aids. Confirmation of solid solution was completed using x-ray diffraction, which had an excellent match with the theoretical values computed using Vegard’s Law, which confirmed the formation of the solid solutions.

40|$|Here the sol-gel {{technique}} was {{employed in the}} production of ultra-high temperature ceramic fibres, utilising forcespinning as the major fibre forming technique. The ultra-high temperature ceramic fibres produced in this work were titanium carbide, zirconium carbide, titanium diboride and zirconium diboride. These were achieved after a series of heat treatment steps from the fibres produced via forcespinning. Upon the production of ultra-high temperature ceramic fibres these were densified via various means such as elevated heat treatments or infiltration. Finally the production of ceramic matrix composites with fibres originating from sol-gel was attempted. Sol-gel was chosen as the means to produced ultra-high temperature ceramic fibres due to its characteristics of nano-scale mixing and it being a liquid based processing technique. The nano-scale mixing allowed the chemicals employed here, namely metal alkoxides (metal oxide source) and furfuryl alcohol (carbon source), to mix homogenously and subsequently produce metal oxide and carbon fibres with good microstructures upon heat treatments. The formation and variation of these sol-gel solutions to produce titanium carbide and zirconium carbide precursor fibres was a strong focus of the work undertaken here, with influence of acids and acetylacetone examined. With acid being shown to accelerate the hydrolysis and condensation reactions in the sol-gel system and acetylacetone being a suitable means to control this acceleration. In conjunction with this the effects of varying sol-gel variables such as furfuryl alcohol were discussed, with furfuryl alcohol content being a suitable means to control the final carbon content in the fibres produced. With the production of a sol-gel solution capable of being formed into fibres, the examination of techniques to do as such was examined. Techniques examined here were electrospinning and forcespinning, with the forcespinning technique being chosen due to its greater production rate. Therefore the variation of forcespinning variables was examined, with it being found that variables that aided {{in the production of}} drier fibres upon collection resulted in superior fibre morphologies. These variables included the choice of spinneret, revolutions per minute of the spinneret and collector distance. Upon forcespinning, the resultant fibres are polymeric in nature, therefore for the production of ultra-high temperature ceramic fibres heat treatments are required. Here the role heat treatments play in the pyrolysis of fibres, carbothermal reduction of the fibres, densification of the fibres and phase changes of the fibres is discussed. This is in conjunction with other variables, such as the carbon content of the fibres undergoing heat treatment and the sintering temperature used. It was discovered that with the correct starting fibres (ones with suitable carbon content) the formation of titanium carbide and zirconium carbide fibres was possible. Furthermore, with elevated sintering temperatures up to 2000 °C, <b>dense</b> titanium <b>carbide</b> fibres are able to be produced. However zirconium carbide fibres still contain some porosity even up to 2300 °C. Here the use of sintering additives (boron nitride) is also discussed, with it being shown that the use of sintering additives allows the production of titanium diboride and zirconium diboride fibres. The formation of these fibres is investigated with the aid of thermodynamics and the investigation of numerous variables such as sintering temperature and time. Through this investigation it was found that to produce fibres that contain predominately titanium diboride or zirconium diboride phase, reduced sintering temperature and hold times were beneficial. With the production of dense ultra-high temperature ceramic fibres, the final topic investigated was the possibility of using these ultra-high temperature ceramic fibres, originating from sol-gel, in ceramic matrix composites. As such ultra-high temperature ceramic fibres were added into matrix materials of either zirconium diboride or silicon carbide. The ability to add a carbon layer onto fibres was also investigate as a means to improve the efficiency of the fibres, by means of coating with furfuryl alcohol. This method proved problematic due to the general loss of fibre morphology upon the coating process. The ceramic matrix composites were sintered via spark plasma sintering and underwent Vickers hardness testing. The cracks introduced via this testing were subsequently examined via scanning electron microscopy, and possible fibre/crack interactions are shown...|$|R
40|$|Group IV {{transition}} metal carbides are promising materials for high temperature structural application, {{due to their}} unique sets of properties such as high melting temperature, high temperature strength, hardness, elastic modulus, wear and corrosion resistance, metal-like thermal and electrical conductivity and thermal shock resistance. This group includes zir-conium carbide, which, along with its composites, are potential candidates for applications such as nose cones for re-entry vehicle, engines, wear resistant parts and in nuclear fuel cladding. Such structural applications demand high strength material with minimal flaws, {{in order to achieve}} the required reliability. Attainment of high strength calls for fully dense material with as small a grain size as possible. Producing fully <b>dense</b> zirconium <b>carbide</b> requires very high temperature, which is a direct consequence of its high melting point. Higher processing temperatures increase grain size, thereby also causing a loss in strength, along with the increased cost. Therefore, there is always a driving force to produce such a material in fully densified form at as low a temperature as possible. There {{have been a number of}} studies on processing and densification of zirconium carbide. Pressureless sintering of zirconium carbide requires temperature of 2400 oC- 3000 oC to reach reasonably high density. At such high temperatures, abnormal grain growth limits the final density, as pores get entrapped inside the grains. Hot pressing of zirconium carbide also requires upwards of 2000 oC to reach high density and is the primary route to produce densified zirconium carbide product. Reactive hot pressing (RHP), is a relatively new processing approach. Here, the reaction between zirconium and carbon to produce zirconium carbide and the densification of the porous mass, occurs simultaneously. Study on reactive hot pressing of zirconium carbide have shown that, it is possible to achieve very high density at much lower temperatures 1600 oC. Clearly, reactive processing is an exciting new technique to process zirconium carbide. However, there has been a lack of studies to understand why it provides better densification than conventional hot pressing. Such understanding is of paramount importance, as it can lead to better optimization of RHP and perhaps even lower the process temperature further. The objective of the present study is to understand the densification process in RHP of zirconium carbide through systematic and carefully designed experiments. A model of reactive hot pressing is also constructed to get more insight into the phenomenon. 0. 1 	Pressureless Reaction Sintering of Zirconium Car-bide Pressureless reaction sintering (RS) of zirconium carbide is studied to understand the role of stoichiometry and zirconium metal in densification. ZrC of four different stoichiometries are chosen for these sets of experiments which are conducted in vacuum at 1200 oC and 1600 oC for 1 hour to understand the role of stoichiometry. One sample of pure Zr is also sintered to elucidate the role of zirconium in densification. After reaction sintering, all the samples are characterized by density measurement, x-ray diffraction and microstructure, using scanning electron microscopy. After pressureless sintering at 1600 oC, zirconium metal reaches the highest relative density of ~ 95 %. Densification decreases monotonically with increasing stoichiometry. Zr+ 0. 5 C composition reaches the next best relative density (of 90 %), while Zr+ 0. 67 C composition shows much lower densification. The other two compositions, Zr+ 0. 8 C and Zr+C, in contrast, display de-densification rather than densification. Since the pure zirconium sample reaches high density, it can, in principle, help in densification of the mixed powders before getting fully reacted. Non-stoichiometric carbides also exhibit higher diffusivity of carbon, which aids the densification and the greater the deviation from stoichiometry, the smaller the deleterious effects of de-densification from reaction. This troika of factors is responsible for the substantially better densification in non-stoichiometric carbide, compared to stoichiometric carbide. 0. 2 	Reactive Hot Pressing of Zirconium and Carbon Reactive hot pressing of zirconium carbide is explored with the emphasis on finding the underlying densification mechanism. The earlier proposed densification mechanism for RHP is the plastic flow of transient non-stoichiometric carbide. To differentiate the effect of transient phases from that of zirconium, RHP is carried out at 800 oC. At this low temperature, transient phases cannot take part in plastic flow and subsequent densification. Thus, any densi cation at this temperature can be totally attributed to zirconium and the role of zirconium thus can be separated from that of transient phases. A combination of RHP and RS experiments are carried out at 1200 oC to better understand the phenomenon. Again, ZrC carbide of four different stoichiometries are investigated in this RHP study. After RHP at 800 oC, all the four different ZrC compositions reached more than 90 % RD through plastic flow of the Zr leading to a continuous matrix with embedded graphite particles. Since the reaction remains incomplete at this temperature, it is clear that Zirconium alone is responsible for enabling densification at such a low temperature. It is therefore argued that any unreacted Zr would, at higher temperature, be able to drive densification even more. Thus, zirconium does not only participate in densification; it is a dominant factor enabling low temperature densification. Pressureless reaction sintering at 1200 oC following the RHP at 800 oC, results in de-densi fication, as the reaction between zirconium and carbon occurs with significant volume shrinkage. Since such shrinkage increases with stoichiometry of the carbide, the higher stoichiometry carbides are more susceptible to de-densification. RHP at 1200 oC, mostly completes the reaction, but only ZrC 0 : 5 reaches near theoretical density. Thus, the final density of the fully reacted mixture is arrived at through a combination of processes in which the more stoichiometric carbides suffer from not only the smaller metal content but also a greater volume shrinkage during reaction. Thus, ZrC 0 : 5 reaches 99 % RD whereas ZrC reaches only 85 % RD. The interplay between these two processes may be controlled by a two step RHP begin-ning at 800 oC followed by a ramp up to 1200 oC. The higher RD achieved at 800 C results in a higher final density for all the four compositions. Thus, two step RHP is a novel way to get better densification in RHP of zirconium carbide. 0. 3 	Hot Pressing of Zirconium Carbide Powders of Different Stoichiometry In the literature, densification in RHP is mostly attributed to the presence of transient non-stoichiometric carbides. To examine this hypothesis, ZrC of three different stoichiometries are prepared and then subjected to hot pressing at the same temperature and pressure as the previous RHP experiments (i. e. 1200 oC and 40 MPa for 30 min). After the hot pressing experiments, ZrC 0 : 5 composition shows significant densification (95 % RD), whereas ZrC 0 : 67 composition shows very limited densification (70 % RD) and ZrC composition shows little or no densification (50 % RD). Evidently, the transient phase formed with stoichiometry close to ZrC 0 : 5 can certainly contribute substantially to densification. But for the more carbon-rich compositions, the transient phases do not appear to play a significant role and the benefit of RHP, wherein ZrC can reach 90 % RD, must come from the contribution of metal plasticity. 0. 4 	Reactive Hot Pressing of Zirconium and Zirconium Carbide Two limiting factors for densification during RHP are, de-densification (courtesy of the reaction) and the gradual increase in volume fraction of a rigid, non-sintering phase. To investigate the role of these factors further, two compositions of mixed metal and carbide powders, namely Zr+ZrC and 0. 5 Zr+ZrC, are subjected to RHP. When reaction is complete, the compositions after RHP will correspond to ZrC 0 : 5 and ZrC 0 : 67, respectively, but with the following difference with respect to the metal-carbon mixtures investigated earlier: these new compositions do not experience de-densification due to reaction and they contain significantly more amount of hard phase (53 and 69 %) in the starting composition than their zirconium and carbon mixture counterparts i. e. Zr+ 0. 5 C and Zr+ 0. 67 C (16 and 20 %). These two compositions are subjected to the same process schedules, i. e., RHP at 800 oC, pressureless reaction sintering at 1200 oC following RHP at 800 oC and two step 800 oC and 1200 oC RHP. After 800 oC RHP, Zr+ZrC and 0. 5 Zr+ZrC compositions reach much lower density than Zr+ 0. 5 C and Zr+ 0. 67 C compositions as a direct consequence of the larger amount of hard phase hindering densification at the lower temperature. After the 1200 oC pressureless sintering following the RHP at 1200 oC, the RD of Zr+ZrC and 0. 5 Zr+ZrC compositions increase (which is opposite to the behaviour of Zr+ 0. 5 C and Zr+ 0. 67 C com-positions) as they do not su er from reaction derived de-densification. After two step RHP, Zr+ZrC and 0. 5 Zr+ZrC compositions reach a final RD that is higher than the Zr+ 0. 5 C and Zr+ 0. 67 C compositions, even though after the first RHP at 800 oC, they were much less densified. Thus, the absence of de-densification during reaction is able to more than compensate for the increase in hard phase content. 0. 5 	Reactive Hot Pressing: Low temperature process-ing route Based on the major factors of densification identified earlier, it was investigated whether RHP temperatures could be brought down further while being supplemented by a free sintering step to complete the reaction without de-densification. From a practical standpoint, such a process would allow dense products to be made by hot pressing with low temperature dies and fixtures while carrying out a more economical pressureless sintering at higher temperatures Therefore, Metal-carbide mixtures, Zr+ZrC and Ti+ZrC, are chosen, along with a temperature of 900 C which is above the allotropic phase transformation temperature for Zr around 880 oC, thereby utilizing a zirconium phase that is softer than the hexagonal Zr. For completion of reaction, pressureless reaction sintering is done at 1300 oC and 1400 oC. It is found that after 1400 oC reaction sintering, both the compositions reach almost full density and the Ti+ZrC composition also shows a higher hardness (13 vs 10 GPa) than the Zr+ZrC composition, due to the formation of a binary carbide with consequent solid solution hardening. 0. 6 	Effect of Particle Size on Reactive Hot Pressing During RHP, premature exhaustion of zirconium by reaction can limit densification. One way to have better densification is to slow down the reaction, so that significant amount of densification takes place before the metal zirconium is exhausted. One way to reduce reaction rates is to increase particle size. Larger particles are expected to slow down the reaction without affecting sintering, as densification is controlled by power law creep of Zr which is grain size independent. Because of lack of availability of Zr with different particle sizes, two different graphite particle sizes, i. e. 7 - 10 m and 50 - 60 m, were studied and it was shown that after 1200 oC RHP, indeed the larger particle size improves densification. 0. 7 	Modelling of Reactive Hot Pressing Reactive hot pressing is a complicated phenomenon, and to get an insight and also to optimize the parameters, the availability of a computational model is of paramount importance. Keeping that in mind, a model of RHP has been constructed based on four different parts, namely: 1. Densification of zirconium under pressure 2. Reaction of zirconium and carbon 3. The constraint on sintering from a rigid phase and, finally, 4. The volume contraction during reaction. The model uses published data for the 4 steps and shows reasonable qualitative and quantitative agreement with the experimental results. Further experiments are done with the model to optimize the processing parameters. Results from the virtual experiments consolidates our earlier conviction gained from experimental results, by showing zirconium is the principal factor in densification and exhaustion of zirconium coupled with reaction derived de-densification prevent the higher stoichiometric carbide from achieving full densification. It also shows, RHP gives best densification when reaction is 70 - 80 % complete. So two step RHP where the first RHP will only complete the reaction 70 - 80 %, and a final RHP at temperature which will complete the reaction, will possibly be the way to achieve best densification. 0. 8 	Conclusions The study on RHP of zirconium carbide led to the following conclusions: •	Zirconium plays the most crucial role in densification. •	Transient phases only play a role when the final stoichiometry of RHPed carbide is close to that of ZrC 0 : 5. •	De-densification from reaction prevents higher stoichiometric carbide from reaching full densification. •	Two step RHP, with one RHP at lower temperature at which reaction will remain incomplete, and the other at higher temperature to complete the reaction, yields best densification. •	For lower stoichiometric carbide (ZrC 0 : 5,ZrC 0 : 67), full densification can be achieved at 1200 oC. For higher stoichiometric carbide, even though large amount of densification upward of 90 % RD is achieved at 1200 oC, full densification will be out of reach. •	RHP shows better densification than conventional hot pressing for all stoichiometries...|$|R
