50|$|The Townsend <b>discharge</b> or Townsend <b>avalanche</b> is a gas {{ionisation}} process where free electrons are accelerated by an electric field, collide with gas molecules, and consequently free additional electrons.

The stratification of the rocks on the east face seemed to him favourable, and the slope not excessive. His plan of attack was complicated: a huge rock couloir, the base of which lies on the Italian side below the Breuiljoch, on the little Matterhorn glacier, would be ascended to a point {{high up on the}} Furggen ridge; from there, traversing the east face of the mountain, he meant to reach the Hörnli (north-east) ridge and follow it to the summit. However, when this route was attempted, the mountain <b>discharged</b> an <b>avalanche</b> of stone upon the climbers, and the ascent failed.

40|$|Experiments using {{entangled}} photons {{and their}} applications require {{the detection of}} extremely weak light beams: the incoming photons arrive to the detector one at a time. Visible spectrum single photon detection is a challenging problem because the photon energy can produce only one electron-hole pair and such a signal {{is less than the}} sum of the intrinsic noise of the semiconductor detector and the associated electronics. Nevertheless, a free electron can initiate an <b>avalanche</b> <b>discharge</b> within an <b>avalanche</b> photodiode (APD), reversely polarized at a value slightly higher than its breakdown voltage. The discharge quenching and the restoration of the APD voltage are necessary to enable another photon detection. The module we are talking about is using both the passive quenching – to limit the discharge current to small enough values, considered safe – and the active quenching – to increase the upper margin of the measuring range to values as high as 1,… 1. 5 mega pulses per second. Some major technical problems we have dealt with, to create a single photon detection module are presented:- APD equivalent dynamic resistor evaluation;- shielding against background light;- controlling the APD working temperature.

Avalanche diodes are optimized for avalanche effect so they exhibit small but significant voltage drop under breakdown conditions, unlike Zener diodes that always maintain a voltage higher than breakdown. This feature provides better surge protection than simple Zener diode and acts more like a gas <b>discharge</b> tube replacement. <b>Avalanche</b> diodes have a small positive temperature coefficient of voltage, where diodes relying on the Zener effect have a negative temperature coefficient.|$|R
40|$|A {{laser power}} supply system is {{described}} in which separate pulses are utilized to avalanche ionize the gas within the laser and then produce a sustained discharge to cause the gas to emit light energy. A pulsed voltage source is used to charge a storage device such as a distributed capacitance. A transmission line or other suitable electrical conductor connects the storage device to the laser. A saturable inductor switch is coupled in the transmission line for containing the energy within the storage device until the voltage level across the storage device reaches a predetermined level, which level is less than that required to avalanche ionize the gas. An avalanche ionization pulse generating circuit is coupled to the laser for generating a high voltage pulse of sufficient amplitude to avalanche ionize the laser gas. Once the laser gas is avalanche ionized, the energy within the storage device is discharged through the saturable inductor switch into the laser to provide the sustained <b>discharge.</b> The <b>avalanche</b> ionization generating circuit may include a separate voltage source which is connected across the laser or {{may be in the}} form of a voltage multiplier circuit connected between the storage device and the laser...|$|R
40|$|Analogous to {{terrestrial}} {{dust devils}}, charged dust in Mars dust devils should become vertically stratified in the convective features, creating large scale E-fields. This E-field in a Martian-like atmosphere {{has been shown}} to stimulate the development of a Townsend <b>discharge</b> (electron <b>avalanche)</b> that acts to dissipate charge in regions where charge build-up occurs. While the stratification of the charged dust is a source of the electrical energy, the uncharged particulates in the dust population may absorb a portion of these avalanching electrons, thereby inhibiting dissipation and leading to the development of anomalously large E-field values. We performed a laboratory study that does indeed show the presence of enhanced E-field strengths between an anode and cathode when dust-absorbing filaments (acting as particulates) are placed in the avalanching electron flow. Further, the E-field threshold condition to create an impulsive spark discharge increases to larger values as more filaments are placed between the anode and cathode. We conclude that the spatially separated charged dust creates the charge centers and E-fields in a dust devil, but the under-charged portion of the population acts to reduce Townsend electron dissipation currents, further fortifying the development of larger-than-expected E-fields...|$|R

40|$|In a small high {{pressure}} <b>discharge</b> gap, <b>avalanches</b> and streamers start ionization {{but do not}} produce gas heating or a conducting bright filamentary channel. The electron density is not high enough to promote the ion-electron interaction that leads to rapid neutral gas heating. Nevertheless, long after initial ionization has subsided in a gap, a very rapid transient stage is produced. This constitutes the spark proper and changes a weakly ionized cold gas into a hot, highly conducting luminous fluid. The spark stage may incorporate very rapidly moving luminous fronts, and depending on the power supply, {{may lead to a}} much cooler are discharge. It has been suggested many times that the spark transition can be associated with electron fluid behavior : For instance, using 2 mm long gaps we have shown that the initial ionization produces a long-lived high temperature, non-equipartition electron fluid, and that the propagation of fast luminous fronts can be associated with non-linear electron waves. 1 Here we present evidence to show that, under appropriate conditions, subsonic electron fluid behavior can also be exhibited. It is schown that heating of the gas can be accomplished by electrons that be-have as a fluid and undergo subsonic turbulent mixing. From a practical point of view, the study is pertinent to problems in lightning, explosion and ignition of combustible gas mixtures, vacuum discharges and electrode erosion problems...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} helium {{pressure}} and flow rate on {{the propagation of}} microplasmas obtained inside hollow-core fibers (HCFs) with their inner diameters of 100 - 2000 μm {{has been reported in}} this study.

Comparison between experimental results and analytical mode shows that Townsend's model is valid for understanding the discharge process of microplasmas inside HCFs, where the wall effect has to be considered. Analysis indicates that long-lived metastable species (Hem&z. ast) from one previous discharge period can greatly contribute to the propagation of microplasmas along the microns-thick HCFs.

We confirm the general trend of all single-stage detectors to follow Raether's criterion, i. e. a spontaneous transition from avalanche to streamer, followed by a <b>discharge,</b> when the <b>avalanche</b> size reaches a value of a few 10 7; a noticeable exception is the micro-dot counter holding more than 10 8. In multiple structures, where the gain under irradiation is increased by at least one order of magnitude; we speculate this to be a consequence of a voltage dependence of Raether's limit, larger for low operating potentials. Our conclusion is that only multiple devices can guarantee a sufficient margin of reliability for operation in harsh LHC running conditions...|$|R
40|$|Oxide-based metal–insulator–metal {{structures}} are {{of special interest}} for future resistive random-access memories. In such cells, redox processes on the nanoscale occur during resistive switching, which are initiated by the reversible movement of native donors, such as oxygen vacancies. The formation of these filaments is mainly attributed to an enhanced oxygen diffusion due to Joule heating in an electric field or due to electrical breakdown. Here, {{the development of a}} dendrite-like structure, which is induced by an <b>avalanche</b> <b>discharge</b> between the top electrode and the Ta 2 O 5 -x layer, is presented, which occurs instead of a local breakdown between top and bottom electrode. The dendrite-like structure evolves primarily at structures with a pronounced interface adsorbate layer. Furthermore, local conductive atomic force microscopy reveals that the entire dendrite region becomes conductive.

40|$|Partial {{discharges}} which {{emanate from}} solid dielectrics immersed in insulating oil when high impulse voltages are applied under different environmental temperatures (20, 40 and 80 °C) are discussed. The solid dielectrics {{used for the}} measurements are phenol-impregnated pressboard and industrial bakelite. The samples are cut in wafers of 150 mm diameter and are 1 or 2 mm thick. The insulating oil is a typical transformer oil. The switching type of the impulse voltage used, 250 / 2500 μs, corresponds to functional situations and is long enough to produce the effects that can be detected without the consideration of charge transfer phenomena due to fast rates of field changes. Experimental {{results show that the}} total charge transfer due to partial discharges is increased by temperature. A possible explanation of the undergoing physical process may be that in the low-field regime, temperature perturbation effects on the injected current are characterized by the conductivity changes in the volume of the dielectric, while as partial <b>discharges</b> start occurring, <b>avalanche</b> multiplication of conduction electrons appears to be the dominant phenomenon, characterizing the behavior of a metal/thick insulator/metal structure in the high-field regime.

40|$|Reliability aspects {{are getting}} more and more {{important}} for modern microelectronics and their applications. Effects in the substrate which negatively impact robustness and reliability of a circuit is one such aspect. Cross-talk due to capacitive coupling, latch-up due to parasitic devices or avalanche generation for high currents can occur. To investigate these effects new substrate models are required for circuit simulations. Current conduction is a non-linear problem and can be solved by using a physics-based device simulator like TCAD (Technology Computer Aided Design). For high frequencies and low electric field an AC analysis provides the results for substrate cross-talk. In case of high currents and high electric fields like in an ESD (Electro Static <b>Discharge)</b> event the <b>avalanche</b> breakdown leads to current filamentation and self-heating. TCAD gives very accurate results, but only for single devices and with intolerable runtime. To improve the performance we create models for the circuit simulations out of the TCAD results. For the low field crosstalk this is achieved by simplifying the model to an RC network. In case of an ESD event by creating a mode for one dimensional conduction and connect different compact models on circuit level. In this work both models are compared to each other and the requirements on the tool are shown...|$|R
40|$|The {{doctoral}} thesis deals with diagnostics of local defects in PN junctions and brings {{new information about}} microplasma noise behaviour and its usage for the temperature changes detection inside PN junctions. Defects in PN junctions {{are the source of}} microplasma noise. There were deviations observed in microplasma noise from the common known rectangle shape pulses during the measurements. These deviations were correlated with the temperature change directly in the defect area and in the defect area surroundings. Generation and recombination coefficients are commonly thought to be constant. However, these coefficients were observed to be not stable with time and this effect is explained in this work. The {{doctoral thesis}} then focuses on the PN junction parameters determination in the case when {{it is not possible to}} define unambiguously whether it is abrupt or linearly graded PN junction. The most significant parameters which are to be determined are barrier capacity, diffusion voltage and depleted area width in dependence on the voltage. The correlation between local <b>avalanche</b> <b>discharge</b> in PN junction and negative differential resistance appearance on VA characteristics of reverse-biased diode was qualitatively verified. The last important point in the work is computer modelling of temperature behaviour in the defect area and its surroundings during local avalanche breakdown. Thus the method of real diodes heating area parameters determination was introduced...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} design and {{performances}} of a radiation detector based on plastic scintillating fibers with doubleside readout by means of large-area Single Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPAD). This can be the basic step toward the realization of a large-area, cost-effective position sensitive detector to be employed in future space gammaray observatories. SPADs are silicon devices operated above the junction breakdown voltage (with the typical overvoltage of 5 V), for which a single photon interacting in the active region is sufficient to trigger a selfsustainable <b>avalanche</b> <b>discharge.</b> SPADs can thus {{be used for the}} detection of very low light levels with a fast time response around 50 ps FWHM for single photon detection, without spectroscopic capabilities. Large-area SPAD (500 μm in diameter) have been designed and fabricated at the CNR-IMM facility, with an intrinsic noise lower than 10 kHz at - 15 °C, and are optically coupled to both ends of 3 -meter long scintillating fibers, with the same diameter. Double-side readout is required to operate the devices in coincidence (10 ns coincidence window), {{in order to reduce the}} rate of false detections to the level of 1 Hz. The detectors have been tested with minimum ionizing particles at CERN PS demonstrating a detection efficiency larger than 90 % and a moderate position resolution along the fiber due to the difference in time of arrival between the two photodetectors.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{possibility}} to use Single Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) optically coupled to scintillating fibers as a novel type of gamma-ray detector for space applications. SPADs are silicon devices operating under polarization conditions above the junction breakdown voltage (typical overvoltage of 5 V), for which a single photon interacting in the active region is sufficient to trigger a self sustainable <b>avalanche</b> <b>discharge.</b> SPADs can thus {{be used for the}} detection of very low light levels with an absolute timing accuracy of about 30 ps for single photon detection, without spectroscopic capabilities. In this presentation we report the preliminary results on large area SPAD (actual results refers to SPADs having 200 µm diameter, with the aim to grow up to 500 µm SPADs) coupled to scintillating fibers as the basic module for a particle tracker for space application. Dark counts rate as low as few tens of kHz at room temperature, lowering down to few kHz at − 10 °C have been obtained for the 200 µm devices, in accordance with the basic requirements for the proposed application. Similar instruments based on silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) readout have already been studied, but none based on SPAD has been realized up to now. Moreover, since very few information is available on SPADs for the use in a space environment, we performed bulk damage and total dose radiation tests with protons and gamma-rays in order to evaluate their radiation hardness properties and their suitability for application in a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) space mission.

40|$|International audienceThe runaway {{electron}} mechanism {{is of great}} importance for {{the understanding of the}} generation of x- and gamma rays in atmospheric discharges. In 1991, terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs) were discovered by the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory. Those emissions are bremsstrahlung from high energy electrons that run away in electric fields associated with thunderstorms. In this paper, we discuss the runaway threshold definition with a particular interest in the influence of the angular scattering for electron energy close to the threshold. In order to understand the mechanism of runaway, we compare the outcome of different FokkerPlanck and Monte Carlo models with increasing complexity in the description of the scattering. The results show that the inclusion of the stochastic nature of collisions smooths the probability to run away around the threshold. Furthermore, we observe that a significant number of electrons diffuse out of the runaway regime when we take into account the diffusion in angle due to the scattering. Those results suggest using a runaway threshold energy based on the FokkerPlanck model assuming the angular equilibrium that is 1. 6 to 1. 8 times higher than the one proposed by [1, 2], depending on the magnitude of the ambient electric field. The threshold also is found to be 5 to 26 times higher than the one assuming forward scattering. We give a fitted formula for the threshold field valid over a large range of electric fields. Furthermore, we have shown that the assumption of forward scattering is not valid below 1 MeV where the runaway threshold usually is defined. These results are important for the thermal runaway and the {{runaway electron}} <b>avalanche</b> <b>discharge</b> mechanisms suggested to participate in the TGF generation...|$|R
40|$|As modern {{satellite}} communication systems move toward multi-carrier high power communications, {{there is an}} increased need for high-power RF devices in the space industry. However, at high-power some RF devices have exhibited an electron plasma (multipactor electron <b>avalanche</b> <b>discharge)</b> that severely damages the RF device and could render it unusable. This is especially a problem in space where repairs to communication equipment is cost-prohibitive. As a result, a number of models have been developed {{in recent years to}} predict the onset of multipactor discharge. However, most existing models can only analyze selected geometries and they also require a large number of electrons to predict the power at which multipactor discharge will occur. This has placed a limitation on the types of RF structures that can be analysed for multipactor breakdown. This research work, uses a new generalized procedure to develop an efficient multipactor model {{that could be used to}} analyze the complex structures found in the commercial space industry, by coupling EM field information from established industry-standard EM solvers. A robust secondary emission model is also developed in order to model the advanced phenomenological characteristics of secondary emission that are not taken into account in other models. The result of the generalized approach taken in this research is a highly efficient multipactor model that requires far fewer electrons to be analysed in order to converge to accurate results, and the ability to analyse more complex RF structures than current models. Multipactor analysis for different structures were performed, and the breakdown results predicted by this model were in good agreement with other models where expected. However, for other cases where certain simplifying assumptions do not hold true, such as higher order waveguide multipaction and high impedance transmission line multipaction, results provided by this model were found to be more accurate and efficient when compared to other models...|$|R
40|$|The {{growing demand}} for {{non-volatile}} memories requires new concepts in data storage and mobile computing, as the existing ﬂash technology runs into a physical scaling limit. One of the promising candidates for future non-volatile memories is Redox-based Resistive Random Access Memory (ReRAM). This memory technology {{is based on a}} non-volatile and reversible switching of device resistance with an external stimulus. The reversible resistance change in the memristive device can be attributed to an electro reduction, which takes place in the metal oxide and/or at the metal oxide electrode interface. The formation of ionic defects and their motion are involved in the electrically induced redox processes, which for most metal oxides is correlated to a valence change of metal ions. Within this thesis the microscopic processes in memristive devices are investigated {{in order to understand the}} defect configuration and defect motion in metal oxide thin films. Furthermore, the redox processes localized in nanoscale ﬁlaments induced by field-driven defect motion has been elucidated. The resistive switching characteristic of Ta 2 O 5 −x single layers as well as Nb 2 O 5 −x/Ta 2 O 5 −x heterostructures has been investigated. It could be demonstrated that the forming voltage of the memristive devices can be modified by different reactive sputtering conditions. During electrical biasing a morphological change with a dendrite-like shape occurs at the top electrode. The formation of this dendrite-like structure at the metal oxide/metal interface, has been correlated to an <b>avalanche</b> <b>discharge</b> induced redox process in the metal oxide. The dendrite-like structure can be assigned to an oxygen deficient amorphous phase of the metal oxide. The predominant defects in TiO 2 −x are determined by ionic charge compensation at intermediate oxygen partial pressure and dominated by electronic charge compensation at reducing conditions. For Ta 2 O 5 −x ceramics as well as thin films the electrical conductivity is dominated by ionic charge compensation over the entire investigated oxygen partial pressure range. The formation energy for oxygen vacancies of single crystal/ceramics is comparable to the values of the thin films. At oxidizing conditions the thin films show an enhanced ionic conduction due to an increased concentration of defects at the grain boundaries and an accumulation of the space charges. The equilibration process in TiO 2 −x single crystals as well as in thin films is dominated by a surface exchange process. The velocity of the equilibration process is influenced by the surface orientation of single crystals. In TiO 2 −x thin films a two-fold surface exchange process has been identified. As origin of this two fold process the incorporation or release of a second species such as water was discussed as well as the influence of the texturing of the thin ﬁlm and the influence of the substrate...|$|R
