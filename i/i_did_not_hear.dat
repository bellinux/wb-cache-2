25|$|There {{were three}} or four camps {{under the name of}} Camp Farouk at that time in Afghanistan. I {{attended}} the open mainstream camp, not terrorist camps. I would not have been there if there was any suggestion of terrorist activity or the targeting of civilians. How would a white boy new to Islam, not understanding local customs or languages, largely uneducated in the ways of the world, get access to such supposedly secret camps planning acts of terror? The camps I attended were not al-Qaeda. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>hear</b> about such an organisation until my arrival in Guantanamo Bay.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Montville {{noted that}} more {{books have been}} written about Ruth than any other member of the Baseball Hall of Fame. At least five of these books (including Creamer's and Wagenheim's) were written in 1973 and 1974. The books were timed to {{capitalize}} on the increase in public interest in Ruth as Henry Aaron approached his career home run mark, which he broke on April 8, 1974. As he approached Ruth's record, Aaron stated, [...] "I can't remember a day this year or last when <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>hear</b> the name of Babe Ruth." ...|$|E
500|$|H.F Sills was an AT RR {{engineer}} {{who had just}} arrived in town and knew none of the parties involved. He testified that he saw [...] "the marshal go up and speak to this other party. I ... saw them pull out their revolvers immediately. The marshal had a cane {{in his right hand}} at the time. He throwed up his hand and spoke. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>hear</b> the words though. By that time Billy Clanton and Wyatt Earp had fired their guns off." [...] Grilled by the prosecution, he corroborated virtually all of the defense's testimony.|$|E

2500|$|But the [...] "Farm Hall Transcripts" [...] also {{revealed}} that Weizsäcker had {{taken the lead in}} arguing for an agreement among the scientists that they would claim that they had never wanted to develop a German nuclear weapon. This story was at least untrue {{to the extent that the}} detainees also included scientists actively engaged in eager attempts to build a nuclear bomb, namely Kurt Diebner and Walter Gerlach. Max von Laue later called this agreement [...] "die Lesart" [...] (the Version). Although the memorandum which the scientists drew up was drafted by Heisenberg, von Laue wrote: [...] "The leader in all these discussions was Weizsäcker. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>hear</b> any mention of any ethical point of view." [...] It was this version of events which was given to Jungk as the basis of his book.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{have been}} {{perfectly}} deaf from childhood," [...] she said; [...] "I cannot hear any sound whatever.

6000|$|... "MY DEAR SIR,--You {{will greatly}} oblige me {{by giving the}} [...] {{enclosed}} to Mr. Shelley.

60|$|The single {{unfavorable}} {{opinion is}} Mr. Hunter's, {{who thinks that}} the criticisms are not given with either sufficient seriousness or diffidence, {{and that there is}} a painful sense of effort through the whole.
