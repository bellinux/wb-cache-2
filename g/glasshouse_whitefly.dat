50|$|Trialeurodes vaporariorum, {{commonly}} known as the <b>glasshouse</b> <b>whitefly</b> or greenhouse whitefly, is an insect that inhabits the world's temperate regions. Like various other whiteflies, it is a primary insect pest of many fruit, vegetable and ornamental crops. It is frequently found in glasshouses (greenhouses), polytunnels, and other protected horticultural environments. Adults are 1-2 mm in length, with yellowish bodies and four wax-coated wings held near parallel to the leaf surface.|$|E
40|$|Eretmocerus eremicus is a {{parasitoid}} wasp {{that is not}} {{native to}} Britain. It is a biological control agent of <b>glasshouse</b> <b>whitefly</b> and has recently been released under licence in Britain for the first time. This study assessed the effect of low temperature on the outdoor establishment potential of E. eremicus in Britain. The developmental threshold calculated by three linear methods was between 6. 1 ° and 11. 6 °C, with a degree-day requirement per generation between 256. 3 and 366. 8 ° day− 1. The supercooling points of non-acclimated and acclimated larvae were similar (approximately − 25 °C). Non-acclimated and acclimated larvae were subject to considerable pre-freeze mortality, with lethal temperature (LTemp 50) values of − 16. 3 and − 21. 3 °C, respectively. Lethal time experiments indicated a similar lack of cold tolerance with 50 % mortality of both non-acclimated and acclimated larvae after 7 days at − 5 °C, 10 days at 0 °C and 13 days at 5 °C. Field trials showed that neither non-acclimated nor acclimated larvae survived longer than 1 month when exposed to naturally fluctuating winter temperatures. These results suggest that releasing E. eremicus into British greenhouses would pose minimal risk because typical British winter temperatures would be an effective barrier against establishment in the wild...|$|E
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the Faculty of Sciences, University of Luton, in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of PhilosophyThe incidence, influencing factors and mechanisms of resistance to insecticides {{from a range of}} chemical groups were examined in UK and European populations of the <b>glasshouse</b> <b>whitefly,</b> Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood). Toxicological assessments of populations from a range of plant production glasshouses and comparisons with the responses of a laboratory susceptible strain disclosed levels of resistance to pyrethroid, organophosphate, insect growth regulator (IGR) and neonicotinoid insecticides. Responses to conventional compounds indicated varying levels of resistance, potentially reflecting disparate usage between collection sites. All strains examined possessed resistance to the IGR, buprofezin; some populations were virtually immune to this commonly used control agent. Selection experiments demonstrated reciprocal crossresistance between buprofezin and a further IGR, teflubenzuron, both of which are frequently incorporated into integrated pest management (IPM) programmes for this species. Results for the leading neonicotinoid, imidacloprid, revealed resistance in both UK and European strains, representing the first documented cases of neonicotinoid resistance in this species worldwide, and the first in any insect species within the UK. The lethal effects of vapour emitted by applications of buprofezin and the anti-feedant effects of imidacloprid were demonstrated in T. vaporariorum for the first time. The potential consequences of these factors for both the control and selection of resistance were highlighted. Mechanistic studies using electrophoresis and kinetic spectrophotometer readings showed that neither non-specific esterases nor modified acetylcholinesterases were involved with resistance to either pyrethroid or specific organophosphate insecticides...|$|E
40|$|Two {{whitefly}} species, Bemisia afer (Priesner & Hosny) and B. tabaci (Gennadius) {{were used}} in transmission experiments with Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) (Ipomovirus; Potyviridae). Adults of whiteflies were given access to CBSV by containing them in clip cages on CBSV-infected cassava plants. Whiteflies were then transferred, together or separately, to CBSD-susceptible cassava plants of var. 'Albert' in a controlled environment. In <b>glasshouse</b> experiments, <b>whiteflies</b> were caged with CBSV-infected and virus-free cassava plants. Transmission of CBSV was sporadic and occurred in three of seven experiments when inoculated by B. afer and B. tabaci or B. tabaci alone, but not by B. afer alone. However, rate of transmission was low (maximum 22 %) even when using high whitefly numbers of up to 120 per target plant. Successful transmission was confirmed by the detection of CBSV by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Spread of cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) {{in the field in}} Tanzania coincided with increases in whitefly numbers; further supporting the evidence that B. tabaci is a vector of CBSV. The results of this study establish {{for the first time that}} B. tabaci is the vector of CBSV, similar to other ipomoviruses...|$|R
40|$|International audienceGlasshouse tomato {{production}} {{is reduced by}} the whitefly Trialeurodes vaporariorum, a major worldwide pest of <b>glasshouse</b> crops. <b>Whitefly</b> control is achieved using pesticides or parasitoids, which have drawbacks. There is thus a need for other control methods. For instance, the use of volatile compounds from plant odours could profoundly change the behaviour of plant-eating insects. This practice should be safe because plant odours are usually harmless to humans. Therefore, we have studied the effect of plant volatiles on whiteflies feeding on tomato plants. The rationale was to use the confusion effect by supplying whiteflies with a super-abundance of volatiles. We removed plant headspace volatiles from multiple whitefly host plants. Then, we presented these volatiles to whiteflies feeding on tomato plants. At the same time, whitefly stylet penetration is monitored using electrical penetration graphs (EPG). Plant colonisation, egg laying and honeydew production are analysed in separate experiments. Data are compared to controls in which extracted volatiles from tomato and air alone are presented to the whiteflies. The only significant effect produced by exposure to multiple-host volatiles is a pronounced reduction {{in the incidence of}} phloem-related waveforms during the 15 -h EPG recording. This represents a delay in, rather than a cessation of, phloem-related activities as there is no related reduction in long-term performance. The confusion effect thus does not appear to exert strong effects on whitefly behaviour here...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAbstractThe <b>glasshouse</b> <b>whitefly,</b> Trialeurodes vaporariorum, is an {{important}} pest of many crop plants including tomato, Solanum lycopersicum. Many wild tomato species exhibit a higher resistance to whiteflies. Therefore, locating {{the source of this}} enhanced resistance and breeding it into commercial tomato species is {{an important}} strategy to reduce the impact of pests on crops. Here, we assessed the pest resistance of Lycopersicon pimpinellifolium by comparing oviposition and feeding data from T. vaporariorum on this wild tomato species with data collected from a susceptible commercial tomato, S. lycopersicum var. ‘Elegance’. The location of resistance factors was examined by use of electrical penetration graph (EPG) studies on these tomato species. Results show that whiteflies preferentially settled on the commercial tomato more often in 80  % of the replicates when given free choice between the two tomato species and laid significantly fewer eggs on L. pimpinellifolium. Whiteflies exhibited a shorter duration of the second feeding bout, reduced pathway phase probing, longer salivation in the phloem and more non-probing activities {{in the early stages of}} the EPG on the wild tomato species compared to the commercial tomato. These findings evidence that a dual mode of resistance is present in this wild tomato against T. vaporariorum: a post-penetration, pre-phloem resistance mechanism and a phloem-located factor, which to the best of our knowledge is the first time that evidence for this has been presented. These findings can be used to inform future breeding strategies to increase the resistance of commercial tomato varieties against this important pest...|$|E
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the Panel on Plant Health was asked to provide a {{scientific}} opinion on the report “Evaluation of Strawberry Nursery Plant Cold Treatments on Survival of the Whitefly, Bemisia tabaci” submitted to the European Commission by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) as technical justification for a derogation from requirements listed in Annex IV, Part A, Section 1, point 46 of the Council Directive 2000 / 29 /EC[2]. The Panel reviewed the report to indicate methodological issues of concern and evaluated {{the effectiveness of the}} treatment proposed for the elimination of B. tabaci whiteflies from consignments to be shipped to the EU. In addition, the Panel clarified which viruses listed in the Annexes of Council Directive 2000 / 29 /EC can be transmitted by strawberry plants and by B. tabaci. The Panel concludes that due to the poor quality of the report submitted and to serious shortcomings in the experimental design the report does not demonstrate the effectiveness of the cold treatment proposed. Although there is potential {{for the development of a}} cold treatment protocol for the elimination of B. tabaci from strawberry plant consignments, reliable mortality estimates for the proposed cold treatment of 28 degrees Fahrenheit (- 2. 2 degrees Celsius) for 2 weeks cannot be derived from this study. No B. tabaci-transmitted viruses are currently known to infect strawberry and no viruses of Fragaria spp. listed in Directive 2000 / 29 /EC are known to be transmitted by B. tabaci. However, adult whiteflies of B. tabaci on strawberry consignments can carry plant viruses irrespective of whether strawberry is a host plant for these viruses and thus represent a pathway for the introduction of non-European viruses. There is also some uncertainty concerning the extent to which known or unknown B. tabaci-transmitted viruses could infect strawberry. Two whitefly-transmitted viruses have been recently confirmed as associated with strawberry pallidosis disease occurring in the US: Beet pseudo-yellows virus (BPYV) and Strawberry pallidosis associated virus (Spiv) but are only known to be transmitted by the greenhouse whitefly Trialeurodes vaporariorum and not by B. tabaci. Strawberry plants for planting are vegetatively propagated and are thus subject to infection by viruses. Irrespective of the presence of B. tabaci, strawberry transplants from US may represent a pathway for the introduction of any non-European viruses (and other potentially harmful organisms) of Fragaria. This applies for example to SPaV, which is not reported as present in the EU and, if introduced, could be further spread by its vector, the <b>glasshouse</b> <b>whitefly</b> T. vaporariorum, which is widely established in the EU...|$|E
40|$|Management of pest {{species is}} ordinarily {{required}} {{in the production of}} protected crops. Integrated pest management (IPM) is commonly used when controlling insects. The European Union Sustainable Use Directives states that "integrated pest management’ means careful consideration of all available plant protection methods and subsequent integration of appropriate measures that discourage the development of populations of harmful organisms and keep the use of plant protection products and other forms of intervention to levels that are economically and ecologically justified and reduce or minimise risks to human health and the environment. ‘Integrated pest management’ emphasises the growth of a healthy crop with the least possible disruption to agro-ecosystems and encourages natural pest control mechanisms. ” Effectively monitoring pests is a key component of IPM, with decisions to use biological control agents (BCA) and insecticides often based on the presence of pests in traps. A commonly used monitoring tool is the sticky trap; these traps are coloured and rely primarily on their visual attractiveness to the pest. The capture efficiency of sticky traps can potentially be increased with the addition of light emitting diodes (LEDs). The objective of this project was to use LEDs to enhance the efficacy of yellow sticky traps for trapping a range of insect pests, to enable more effective timing of pest management by optimising pest monitoring. The addition of LEDs may also enable more effective mass trapping via yellow sticky traps, and minimize the trapping of beneficial insects. Comparisons between standard yellow sticky traps and those equipped with green (540 nm) or blue (480 nm) LEDs were carried out at four commercial growing facilities. Green (540 nm) LED equipped traps were compared with standard yellow traps in a mass release of the biological control agent Encarsia formosa Gahan (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae), to determine if there are negative consequences to the addition of green (540 nm) LEDs when using this biological control agent. Relative spectral preferences of western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis Pergande (Thysanoptera: Thripidea)) and <b>Glasshouse</b> <b>whitefly</b> (Trialeurodes vaporariorum Westwood (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae)) were determined using a choice test comparing a range of wavelengths in 20 nm steps against a control wavelength. Green (540 nm), and blue (480 nm) LED equipped traps captured significantly more dark-winged fungus gnats (Bradysia difformis Frey (Sciaridae: Diptera)) and diamondback moths (Plutella xylostella (Linnaeus) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae)) than those without. No {{significant differences were found between}} green (540 nm) LED equipped traps and those without for E. formosa, and a significant decrease in the capture of the shore fly parasitoid Kleidotoma psiloides Westwood (Hymenoptera: Figitidae) was observed. In behavioural experiments F. occidentalis showed a peak spectral preference at 360, 420, and 480 nm, and T. vaporariorum at 320, 340, and 380 nm. The addition of LEDs to yellow sticky traps enhanced their capture efficiency for some key pests in commercial protected crop growing environments, and has the potential to enable pest detection at an early stage, consequently optimising the timing of pest management options...|$|E
