5|$|Warren was {{personally}} responsible for the safety aspects of the Trinity nuclear test on 16 July 1945 at Alamogordo, New Mexico. There was considerable concern about radioactive fallout and a network of geiger counters was established to track the fallout cloud. Groves found Warren at the base camp shortly after the explosion and was displeased to discover that Warren had been awake for the previous 48 hours. Groves had US Navy Captain George Lyons take over so Warren could <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>rest.</b> Fortunately, no problems arose with the test.|$|E

500|$|Late on {{the night}} of August 15, Stark was awakened by the arrival of Parson Thomas Allen and a band of Massachusetts militiamen from nearby Berkshire County who insisted on joining his force. In {{response}} to the minister's fiery threat that his men would never come out again if they were not allowed to participate, Stark is reported to have said, [...] "Would you go now on this dark and rainy night? Go back to your people and tell them to <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>rest</b> if they can, and if the Lord gives us sunshine to-morrow and I do not give you fighting enough, I will never call on you to come again." [...] Stark's forces again swelled the next day with the arrival of some Stockbridge Indians, bringing his force (excluding Warner's men) to nearly 2,000 men.|$|E
60|$|Jacob and I {{would have}} insisted that the old soldier tell us more {{regarding}} the desertion, although it was evident he had imparted all the information at his command; but he, bent on <b>getting</b> <b>some</b> <b>rest</b> before morning, entered the barracks, and we could hardly do better than follow him.|$|R

500|$|On 11 November, he {{returned}} to Maer and proposed to Emma, once more telling her his ideas. She accepted, then in exchanges of loving letters she showed how she valued his openness in sharing their differences, also expressing her strong Unitarian beliefs and concerns that his honest doubts might separate them in the afterlife. While he was house-hunting in London, bouts of illness continued and Emma wrote urging him to <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>rest,</b> almost prophetically remarking [...] "So don't be ill any more my dear Charley till I can be with you to nurse you." [...] He found what they called [...] "Macaw Cottage" [...] (because of its gaudy interiors) in Gower Street, then moved his [...] "museum" [...] in over Christmas. On 24 January 1839, Darwin was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS).|$|E
500|$|Having left Ukraine in September 1922, Quisling and Asja {{returned}} to Kharkov in February 1923 to prolong aid efforts, with Nansen describing Quisling's work as [...] "absolutely indispensable." [...] Quisling found the situation much improved and, with no fresh challenges, {{found it a}} more boring trip than his last. He did however meet Maria Vasiljevna Pasetchnikova (...) , a Ukrainian {{more than ten years}} his junior. Her diaries from the time [...] "indicate a blossoming love affair" [...] during the summer of 1923, despite Quisling's marriage to Asja the year before. She recalled that she was impressed by his fluent command of the Russian language, [...] his Aryan appearance, and his gracious demeanour. Quisling apparently married Pasetchnikova in Kharkov on 10 September 1923, although no legal documentation has been discovered. Quisling's biographer, Dahl, believes that in all likelihood the second marriage was never official. Regardless, the couple behaved as though they were married, and celebrated their wedding anniversary. Soon after the wedding, the aid mission came to an end and the trio left the Ukraine, and from the summer of 1923 onwards they planned to spend a year in Paris. Maria wanted to see Western Europe; Quisling wanted to <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>rest</b> following bouts of stomach pain that had lasted all winter.|$|E
500|$|The {{protagonist of}} the game, {{a young man}} named Danny Roman, suffers from chronic {{insomnia}} caused by worry, stress, and repressed memories. He is admitted to a mental institution for it, where he consults a mad scientist, Dr. Reubens, who treats Danny with his Cognitive Regression Utilizing pSychiatric Heuristics (C.R.U.S.H.) device, which has a sentient female persona. The device's helmet places Danny under hypnosis, during which he can regain control of his sanity by collecting his lost marbles, and facing his primal fears in the form of monsters (i.e. cockroaches, blockwalkers, slugs). Danny starts spilling the beans to Reubens about his city life; moving into his first apartment and his suffering job as a chef. He depends on Reubens for some serious help if he wants to get a good night's sleep. Later, when C.R.U.S.H. projects the image of a bucket and shovel at the beach onto the helmet, he recalls his love life some few years ago with a girl named Tina (who Reubens mistakenly thought was Danny's mother, a recurring joke). Returning the next summer, Danny is jilted for a more handsome man. Devastated, Danny ends up sitting on the pier in shame, accidentally falling into the ocean below, but eventually rescued. Reubens explains that the rejection causes him to distance himself from women, and tells him to <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>rest.</b> The next day, while Dr. Reubens tunes up his machine, making questionable noises, Danny recommends he give them some time alone, but the word [...] "alone" [...] has Reubens lead Danny to recollect the time he was assaulted as a young boy at a local funfair by three thugs, however, Danny blames himself, not his parents, for his mistake, as he ditched his parents to go to the funfair alone, but they find and rescue him (again). He then promised his parents that he'd [...] "stay with them forever." [...] Dr. Reubens uses this evidence to come to a conclusion that homesickness is the cause of his insomnia, recommending that Danny moves back into his parents' house, but his conclusion is proved wrong when Danny returns one more time. Dr. Reubens snaps at Danny for wearing out his machine further, and questions if he is merely [...] "toying" [...] with them. Pushing the limit, Reubens regresses Danny all the way to his childhood, when he was only six years old, against Danny's own will. Danny cries, begging that Reubens stop [...] "unlocking doors that should stay bolted," [...] but in the end, he reveals that his parents went out on a date and left him at his house alone, with disturbing shadows of the night leaving Danny in psychological trauma. Danny discovers that his childhood fears at that time, principally being afraid of the dark, are the real cause his insomnia, sending him [...] "spiraling back into [...] six-year-old self." [...] Reubens is full of disgust that his treatment was a complete waste and that Danny ruined his machine due to his nyctophobia, but tells Danny he's cured. Right when Reubens begins to snap Danny out of hypnosis, C.R.U.S.H. goes over the edge and seems to attack Danny's mind, with Reubens panicking and Danny's life on the line while the screen fades to black {{at the start of the}} attempt.|$|E
50|$|The fake Fleetwood Mac {{consisted}} of Elmer Gantry (vocals, guitar), Kirby Gregory (guitar), Paul Martinez (bass), John Wilkinson (keyboards) and Australian-born drummer Craig Collinge (formerly of The Librettos, Procession and Third World War). Fans {{were told that}} Bob Welch and John McVie had quit the group, and that Mick Fleetwood and Christine McVie would be joining the band at a later date, after <b>getting</b> <b>some</b> <b>rest.</b> The members of the fake Fleetwood Mac apparently had themselves been told that Mick Fleetwood would join them on later dates, and averred that Fleetwood {{had been involved in}} the early planning stages of the tour before dropping out.|$|R

2500|$|Portola's {{expedition}} encountered {{large numbers}} of exceptionally friendly natives, many of whom lived in Syuxtun, a village just {{in back of the}} beach between present-day Chapala and Bath streets. Indeed, the natives [...] – which the Spaniards dubbed the Canaliños for the [...] "canoes" [...] (actually tomols) they used so skillfully – so irritated their guests with gifts and boisterous music that Portola changed the location of his camp on August 19 so the party could <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>rest.</b>|$|E
2500|$|During her visit, Emma thought Darwin looked unwell and overtired.

2500|$|It {{had been}} one of the hardest and closest derny-paced races in history but much more than that this double of Anquetil was one of the {{greatest}} exploits ever seen in cycling. At the Parc des Princes, Anquetil received the biggest ovation of his career, certainly much bigger than after any of his wins in the Tour. The race record was broken, Jacques was mobbed by reporters and photographers but he was tired and really had to <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>rest.</b> Few people realised it at the time but he had to make the long journey to Maubeuge in north-eastern France where the following day he was riding a criterium! ...|$|E

[...] The musicians had been traveling by bus for over a week, and it had already broken down twice. They were tired, {{they had not been}} paid yet, and all of their clothes were dirty.

60|$|Then off Peter Rabbit {{started as}} fast as he could go around the pond one way, and Reddy Fox started around the pond the other way. They were so excited that neither noticed a little splash in the pond.

Only once or twice he stuck his little black nose up to <b>get</b> <b>some</b> air. The <b>rest</b> of the time he swam under water and no one but the Merry Little Breezes saw him. Right across he swam, and climbed up the bank right under the big hickory tree.|$|R

5000|$|In this surreal episode, {{the group}} {{performs}} 33 hours of surgery without sleep. A motor pool administrator refuses to send ambulances {{to the camp}} to evacuate patients (who are piling up rapidly) because they might be damaged by gunfire. In effect, {{they are forced to}} build bunks in Post-Op and move the wounded soldiers into every available space, including Klinger's office (thereby forcing him to sleep in the supply room.) The show centers on the dreams of the cast as they attempt to catch at least a little slumber {{in the midst of the}} crisis. Unfortunately, even their dreams offer no sanctuary from the war, as everyone eventually finds himself or herself glad to be awake. After the marathon of wounded ends and the unit faces a respite from the constant surgery, a few consider <b>getting</b> <b>some</b> long-deserved <b>rest.</b> However, Winchester's glibly-delivered response ("...to sleep, perchance to dream..." [...] from Hamlet, Act 3, Scene 1) causes them to reconsider sleep in favor of coffee to stay awake, and stay away from the dreams.|$|R
2500|$|In mid-April, the {{squadron}} received some glider pilots who were checked {{out on the}} L-5, which enabled the regular squadron pilots to <b>get</b> <b>some</b> much needed <b>rest</b> from their grueling schedules. The Japanese were retreating quickly and {{the order of the}} day was to pursue and attack them whenever possible, liberating village after village. However it was not all work and combat for the unit. Softball games were held and other forms of recreation were encouraged. Occasionally movies were shown and on one occasion, the visit of comedian Joe E. Brown was held. The news of the surrender of Germany on 7 May was welcomed. Combat continued through May and into June and at the end of the month, General MacArthur declared the Luzon Campaign over at midnight of 30 June/1 July 1945. [...] However, the Japanese were still active in the Cagayan Valley, where the enemy had chosen to gather the remnants of their forces. [...] Mission after mission was flown into the area, and it was not until 25 July that the Cagayen Valley was secured.|$|R

Arthur left them for a time to visit Louise, but soon returned with word that she was quietly sleeping {{under the influence of the}} potion the doctor had administered. The three girls—for Mrs. Hahn was only a girl—sat huddled in one corner, whispering at times and trying to cheer one another. The doctor read in his book. Rudolph smoked and lay back in his chair, gazing reflectively at the ceiling. Bul Run had his feet on a second chair and soon fell into a doze, when he snored in such a high falsetto that Arthur kicked his shins to abate the nuisance. The major sat stiffly, gazing straight ahead, and Uncle John tramped up and down the room untiringly. The baby had grown very dear to the hearts of these last two men in the few days they had known her and her sudden loss rendered them inconsolable.|$|R

After the last refugee was on board the British vessels, a party of 22 men, led by the 2º commander of the Mar Negro landed in a boat. They {{took control of the}} port and the hulls of the Spanish steamer Vicente, of 534 ton, the British Dellwyn of 1,420 and a dredger, all of them sunk in shallow waters by earlier air attacks.
