5|$|In Chile, folklorist Oreste Plath {{attributed}} {{the invention of}} the drink to Elliot Stubb, an English steward of a ship named Sunshine, who allegedly mixed <b>Key</b> <b>lime</b> juice, syrup, and ice cubes to create the cocktail in a bar, in 1872, in the port city of Iquique, which at that time was part of Peru. Regardless, the original source cited by Plath attributed to Stubb {{the invention of the}} whiskey sour—not the pisco sour. The oldest known mentions of the pisco sour are from a 1921 magazine attributing Morris as the inventor and a 1924 advertisement for Morris' Bar published in a newspaper from the port of Valparaíso, Chile.|$|E

500|$|The pisco sour {{has three}} {{different}} methods of preparation. The Peruvian pisco sour cocktail {{is made by}} mixing Peruvian pisco with <b>Key</b> <b>lime</b> juice, simple syrup, egg white, Angostura bitters (for garnish), and ice cubes. The Chilean pisco sour cocktail is made by mixing Chilean Pisco with Pica lime juice, powdered sugar, and ice cubes. Daniel Joelson, a food writer and critic, contends that the major difference between both pisco sour versions [...] "is that Peruvians generally include egg whites, while Chileans do not." [...] The version from the International Bartenders Association, which lists the pisco sour among its [...] "New Era Drinks," [...] {{is similar to the}} Peruvian version, but with the difference that it uses lemon juice, instead of lime juice, and does not distinguish between the two different types of pisco.|$|E

Aiming for a codename that was [...] "fun and unexpected", his team pursued the possibility of naming the release [...] "KitKat" [...] instead. Lagerling phoned a representative of Nestlé, who owns the Kit Kat brand and produces the confectionery (outside the United States, where it is produced by The Hershey Company under license), and quickly reached a preliminary deal for a promotional collaboration between the two companies, later finalized in a meeting at Mobile World Congress in February 2013.

5000|$|Chanh muối is a salted, pickled lime in Vietnamese cuisine. Its {{name comes}} from the Vietnamese words chanh (meaning [...] "lime") and muối (meaning [...] "salt"). To make the chanh muối, many <b>limes</b> (often <b>key</b> <b>limes)</b> are packed tightly in salt in a glass {{container}} {{and placed in the}} sun until they are pickled. During the process, juices are drawn off the limes, which dissolves the salt and produces a pickling liquid which immerses the finished chanh muối.|$|R
50|$|Most limes {{are grown}} in the warmer {{southwest}} (60% of total) and southeast of the country (40%). <b>Key</b> <b>limes</b> amount to about 54% of the total lime production, and are {{grown in the}} southwestern states of Jalisco, Colima, Michoacán, Guerrero, and Oaxaca. Persian limes, about 42% of the lime production, are grown in Jalisco, Colima, Hidalgo, in micro-climates in northern Veracruz, and in the southeastern states of Tlaxcala, Chiapas, Tabasco and the Yucatan. The most important lime producing states are Michoacán and Colima.|$|R

5000|$|Shelf life of <b>Key</b> <b>limes</b> is an {{important}} consideration in marketing. The lime still ripens for a considerable time after harvesting, and it is usually stored between [...] at a relative humidity of 75-85%. Special procedures are employed to control the shelf life - for example, applications of growth regulators, fruit wax, fungicides, precise cooling, calcium compounds, silver nitrate, and special packing material. The preferred storage conditions are temperatures of [...] and a humidity over 85%, but even in ideal conditions post-harvesting losses are high.|$|R
50|$|When {{human skin}} {{is exposed to}} {{ultraviolet}} light after contact with lime peel or juice, a reaction known as phytophotodermatitis can occur, which can cause darkening of the skin, swelling or blistering. Bartenders handling limes and other citrus fruits when preparing cocktails may develop phytophotodermatitis due to the high concentration of furocoumarins and other phototoxic coumarins in limes.The main coumarin in limes is limettin which has manifold higher content in peels than in pulp. Persian limes have a higher content of coumarins and potentially greater phototoxicity than do <b>Key</b> <b>limes.</b>|$|R

50|$|Florida {{became a}} state in 1845, but the keys weren’t officially {{incorporated}} until 1870 after they were surveyed by Charles F. Smith. According to locals the key was named after an old settler circa 1855, other documents state the key as being named “Ellis Island before 1855.” The early pioneers suffered from clouds of mosquitos and no-see-ums. They lived in thatched roofed houses that were regularly mowed down by hurricanes, and were cut off from civilization because the island was only navigable by boat. After the FEC built the railroad in 1908, and it brought some prosperity to the area. It connected the island to civilization and opened up {{an opportunity for a}} tourism industry, and ease of moving goods like pineapple, <b>key</b> <b>limes,</b> sponges, charcoal, and shark skins.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are various}} {{approaches}} to the cultivation of <b>Key</b> <b>limes.</b> This variety of citrus can be propagated from seed and will grow true to the parent. The seeds must be kept moist until they can be planted, as they will not germinate if allowed to dry out. [...] If the plants are propagated from seed, the seeds should be stored at least 5-6 months before planting. Alternatively, vegetative propagation from cuttings or by air layering may permit fruit production within one year, and from genetically more predictable lines of plants. Or digging around a mature tree to sever roots will encourage new sprouts that can be transplanted to another location. [...] Clones are often bud grafted into rough lemon or sour orange to obtain strong root stocks (see also fruit tree propagation).|$|R

50|$|The hermit {{tells of}} the Piedras Platas tree where the famed bird stays every night after singing seven songs, warning of the spells in its seven songs which lulls the hearer to sleep and the {{defecation}} which petrifies anyone. He provides Juan with a knife and <b>key</b> <b>limes,</b> both of which Juan must use to cut seven wounds {{on his hands and}} distill into them the juice of the fruits to create the pain that will prevent him from being lulled by the seven songs. The hermit then gives Juan a golden rope which the prince must use to bind the bird's legs while it is asleep and take it prisoner. Before Juan leaves, the hermit provides him with a bucket which he must use to scoop water from a well near the tree and pour over his two petrified brothers to restore them. Don Juan did as was bidden and soon found himself in possession of the desired bird and {{on his way back to}} his home country with his two brothers, Don Pedro and Don Diego.|$|R
500|$|The first {{permanent}} European {{settlers in}} the Miami area did not come until the early 19th century. The first settlements around Biscayne Bay were small farms on Elliott Key growing crops like <b>key</b> <b>limes</b> and pineapples. John James Audubon visited Elliott Key in 1832. Colonel Robert E. Lee surveyed the area around Biscayne Bay for potential fortification sites in 1849. At {{the end of the}} American Civil War in 1865, a number of Confederates passed through the area as they were attempting to escape to Cuba. Elliott Key was a brief stopping point for John C. Breckinridge during his flight to Cuba. The former United States vice president, Confederate general and Confederate secretary of war spent two nights in Biscayne Bay on his journey. Few people lived in the park area until 1897, when Israel Lafayette Jones, an African-American property manager, bought Porgy Key for $300 US. The next year Jones bought the adjoining Old Rhodes Key and moved his family there, clearing land to grow limes and pineapples. In 1911 Jones bought [...] Totten Key, which had been used as a pineapple plantation, for a dollar an acre, selling in 1925 for $250,000. Before Israel Jones' death in 1932 the Jones plantations were for a while among the largest lime producers on the Florida east coast.|$|R
