40|$|Vertical column {{measurements}} of the gaseous composition of the tropical stratosphere were made from the NASA DC- 8 aircraft early in 1992. As anticipated, the burdens of the stratospheric source gases (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> <b>O</b> 3, HF, HCl, ClNO 3, HNO 3) were reduced from their mid-latitude values due to increased uplift and photolysis.

This, together with results obtained from other long-lived gases (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> N 2 <b>O,</b> CH 4, CF 2 Cl 2) indicates that volume mixing ratios found at 22 km altitude at mid-latitudes occurred at 26 km in the sub-tropics and at 30 km in the equatorial zone.

40|$|Four {{experiments}} {{compared the}} effect of forward and backward conditioning procedures {{on the ability of}} conditioned stimuli (CSs) to elevate instrumental responding in a Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer (PIT) task. Two responses were each trained with one distinct outcome (R 1 ->O 1, R 2 ->O 2), either concurrently (Experiment 1) or separately (Experiments 2, 3 and 4). Then, in Experiments 1 and 2, four CSs were either followed or preceded by one outcome (A->O 1, B->O 2, O 1 ->C, O 2 ->D). In Experiment 3 each CS was preceded and followed by an outcome: for one group of participants both outcomes were identical (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> <b>O</b> 1 ->A->O 1, O 2 ->B->O 2), but for the other they were different (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> <b>O</b> 1 ->A->O 2, O 2 ->B->O 1). In Experiment 4 two CSs were preceded and followed by identical outcomes, and two CSs by different outcomes. In the PIT tests participants performed R 1 and R 2 in the presence and absence of the CSs. In Experiments 1 and 2 only the CSs followed by outcomes in Pavlovian training elevated responding. In Experiments 3 and 4 all the CSs elevated responding but based on the outcome that followed them in training. These results support the stimulusoutcome-response (S-O-R) mechanism of specific PIT, according to which CSs elevate responding via activation of its associated outcome representation...|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} ???operational??? {{evaluation of}} the performance of the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modelling system version 4. 6 was conducted in support of pollution assessment in the UK for the calendar year 2003. The model was run on multiple grids using one-way nests down to a horizontal resolution as fine as 5 km over the whole of the UK. The model performance was evaluated for pollutants with standards and limit values (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> <b>O</b> 3, PM 10) and species contributing to acidic and nitrogenous deposition (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> NH 3, SO 42 ???, NO 3 ???, NH 4 +) against data from operational national monitoring networks. The key performance characteristics of the modelling system were found to be variable according to acceptance criteria and to depend on the type (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> urban, rural) and location of the sites, {{as well as on the}} time of the year. As regards the techniques that were used for ???operational??? evaluation, performance generally complied with expected levels and ranged from good (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> <b>O</b> 3, SO 42 ???) to moderate (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> PM 10, NO 3 ???). At a few sites low correlations and large standard deviations for some species (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> SO 2) suggest that these sites are subject to local factors (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> topography, emission sources) that are not well described in the model. Overall, the model tends to over predict O 3 and under predict aerosol species (except SO 42 ???). Discrepancies between predicted and observed concentrations may be due to a variety of intertwined factors, which include inaccuracies in meteorological predictions, chemical boundary conditions, temporal variability in emissions, and uncertainties in the treatment of gas and aerosol chemistry. Further work is thus required to investigate the respective contributions of such factors on the predicted concentrations...|$|R

40|$|Intrinsically ultramicroporous (< 7 Å) {{polymers}} {{represent a}} new paradigm in materials development for membrane-based gas separation. In particular, they demonstrate that uniting intrachain “rigidity”, the traditional design metric of highly permeable polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs), with gas-sieving ultramicroporosity yields high-performance gas separation membranes. Highly ultramicroporous PIMs have redefined the state-of-the-art in large-scale air (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> <b>O</b> 2 /N 2) and hydrogen recovery (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> H 2 /N 2, H 2 /CH 4) applications with unprecedented molecular sieving gas transport properties. Accordingly, presented herein are new 2015 permeability/selectivity “upper bounds” for large-scale commercial membrane-based air and hydrogen applications that accommodate the substantial performance enhancements of recent PIMs over preceding polymers. A subtle balance between intrachain rigidity and interchain spacing has been achieved in the amorphous microstructures of PIMs, fine-tuned using unique bridged-bicyclic building blocks (i. e., triptycene, ethanoanthracene and Tröger’s base) in both ladder and semiladder (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> polyimide) structures...|$|R
