50|$|<b>Humpback</b> and chum <b>salmon</b> {{enter the}} lower {{reaches of the}} Rauchua. Several species of whitefish, {{grayling}} and smelt also live in the river or in the many surrounding lakes. Sticklebacks also live in the lakes along with Arctic char, although the community of char is infested with Acanthocephala. Similar fish exist in the Ust-Chaun region, {{and in addition to}} fish, the wetland is also home to the Siberian newt, which lives in the shrub-covered tundra near the delta.|$|R

5000|$|The Ussuri River has a {{reputation}} for catastrophic floods. It freezes up in November and stays under the ice until April. The river teems with different kinds of fish: grayling, sturgeon, <b>humpback</b> <b>salmon</b> (gorbusha), chum salmon (keta) and others.|$|E
50|$|In {{the summer}} period they feed on blueberries, crowberries, <b>humpback</b> <b>salmon,</b> and steelhead. In autumn, they eat nuts from nut-pines and {{mountain}} ash, and fish. In times of famine they eat dead fish or marine mammals, berries, and graminoid vegetation.|$|E

50|$|The name Whonnock {{is derived}} from a Halkomelem word for <b>humpback</b> <b>salmon</b> or pink salmon, {{the only kind of}} salmon to ascend Whonnock Creek. Whonnock Creek flows from the north, above Dewdney Trunk Road, south to the Fraser River passing Whonnock Lake.|$|E
5000|$|Pink salmon or <b>humpback</b> <b>salmon</b> (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) is {{a species}} of {{anadromous}} fish in the salmon family. It is the smallest and most abundant of the Pacific salmon. The scientific species name {{is based on the}} Russian common name for this species gorbúša (горбуша), which literally means humpie.|$|E
50|$|The {{people of}} Saysetsen would live on Newcastle from January to April {{in order to}} catch the {{spawning}} herring {{before moving on to}} Gabriola Island where they would stay until early August. Then they would traverse the Strait of Georgia to the mouth of the Fraser River. They would stay there until the end of August to catch the sockeye and <b>humpback</b> <b>salmon</b> before continuing back to Vancouver Island for the chum salmon run. They would then be back on Newcastle Island by January. Not much is known about the other village, Clotsun, except that its name means Protector.|$|E
5000|$|Amgun River (Амгу́нь) is a {{river in}} Khabarovsk Krai, Russia that flows {{northeast}} and joins the Amur River {{from the left}} near its mouth. The length of the river is 723 km. The area of its basin is 55500 km2. The Amgun is formed by {{the confluence of the}} Ayakit and Suduk Rivers. Its main tributary is the Nimelen River. The Amgun teems with fish, such as Siberian salmon, <b>humpback</b> <b>salmon,</b> sturgeon, and carp. The Baikal Amur Mainline railway enters the Amgun River valley from the Dusse-Alin Tunnel and follows the river 180 km northeast to Berezovyy where it turns southeast to Komsomolsk.|$|E
30|$|Light spectra in aquatic environments are {{distinct}} from those on land. Not just water itself, but also suspended materials (e.g., mineral particles, detritus, and planktons), can selectively absorb or scatter different wavelengths of light (Litjens et al. 1999). Since the underwater photic environments {{may be affected}} by depth and suspended materials as well as unique features of the habitats, fish under different photic conditions should physiologically adjust its spectral sensitivity {{in order to enhance}} detection ability by maximizing the visual contrast (Endler 1992; Lythgoe 1984). For example, the spectral sensitivity of milkfish (Chanos chanos), <b>humpback</b> <b>salmon</b> (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), and yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) ontogenetically change to fit the photic environment during each developmental stage (Chang et al. 2009 a; Cheng and Flamarique 2004; Loew et al. 2002). Moreover, {{it has been reported that}} spectral sensitivity has evolved to adapt to environmental light parameters in cichlids, seabreams, and moray eels (Seehausen et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2009), especially, the adaptations of RH 1 and LWS opsins to light environments which are documented in cichlid fishes (Sugawara et al. 2005; Terai et al. 2006), as well as in different populations of three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and guppy (Poecilia reticulata) (McDonald and Hawryshyn 1995; Tezuka et al. 2014). The retinal photoreceptor cells of fishes utilize visual pigments, which contain a chromophore (11 -cis-retinal, A 1 retinal, or 11 -cis- 3, 4 -dehydroretinal, A 2 retinal) and opsin, to capture photons. Variations in spectral sensitivity mainly result from the alternative usage of different opsin genes (Flamarique 2013; Johnson et al. 2013; Kasagi et al. 2015; Kondrashev et al. 2013; Valen et al. 2013). Furthermore, sexual selection favors individuals that can display visual signals that are readily distinguishable from the background (Hurtado-Gonzales et al. 2014; Miyagi et al. 2012; Morrongiello et al. 2010; Selz et al. 2014). Therefore, in addition to their link with visual properties, photic environments may also influence overall body coloration of fish.|$|E
40|$|The sauces on {{the basis}} of {{vegetable}} oils and mayonnaise which are traditionally considered tasty, but not really useful at enrichment by functional additives can be used not only for flavoring decoration of various dishes and salads, but also for increase of their nutrition value. Dzhus received by production of salty granular caviar of a <b>humpback</b> <b>salmon</b> represents a full-fledged complex of the major food factors that can serve as motivation for its use when developing new food, including {{in the form of a}} proteinaceous and mineral additive for its additional introduction to compoundings of sauces. In view of existence of a fish smell of a caviar dzhus, it is possible to use it as natural fragrance by production of the wide range of fish products, including emulsion. For an assessment of quality of production, fast and simple the organoleptic (touch) method is very convenient. Various content of easily volatile organic compounds in an equilibrium gas phase over tests is established. Samples of a caviar dzhus among themselves and sauces with its addition differ. Distinctions are defined by amount of the brought ingredient. The intensity of a smell of tests determined by the content of easily volatile compounds on which the massif of sensors is adjusted differs. Sauces with an additive of a caviar dzhus have the greatest intensity of a smell in accordance with GOST at its small contents. In a figure form of "a visual print" of the maximum responses of all sensors in the massif distinctions in a chemical composition of an equilibrium gas phase over tests are established. Distinctions in qualitative and quantitative structure of RGF over samples with addition 1, 5 and 2, 0 of % of a dzhus significantly significant. It is established that addition (on TU and in accordance with GOST) in compoundings of sauces results more than 1 % of a caviar dzhus in essential distinction as a part of RGF...|$|E
