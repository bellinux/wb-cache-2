30|$|Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is an {{important}} food crop globally and the most advanced genetic monocot model amongst the cereal crops (Cantrell and Reeves, 2002). Biotic and abiotic stresses, such as drought and heat, {{are known to be}} detrimental to crop production. Rice production is additionally constraint by submergence stress during the rainy season with complete submergence and water stagnation affecting about 20 million hectares of rice fields in the tropics, causing significant yield and economic losses, and food insecurity (Septiningsih et al., 2012). Rice fields can be <b>flooded</b> with several <b>meters</b> of water for weeks and plants die within a few days from lack of oxygen and impaired photosynthesis (Gibbs and Greenway, 2003; Fukao and Bailey-Serres, 2004). Furthermore, in the attempt to escape the water, plants excessively elongate leaves thereby depleting their carbohydrate and energy reserves, and as water recedes, the plants lodge thus impairing any recovery growth (Singh, Singh, and Ram, 2001; Das, Sarkar, and Ismail, 2005; Fukao, Xu, Ronald, and Bailey-Serres, 2006).|$|R

40|$|The {{flooding}} {{of urban}} areas {{has been a}} serious problem that several municipalities have faced in recent years. The occupation {{of land in the}} municipality of Muriaé - MG has been given the rather chaotic and directing is primarily to the flat regions, especially for the flood of the river floodplains Muriaé. The motivation for this study arose from the need to provide information for decision-making by the municipal administrator in the direction of their public policies. For this reason it was created a Digital Elevation Model Hidrologically Consistent (MDEHC) from a survey planialtimétrico for the characterization of relief. MDEHC possession of the simulations were performed, varying altitudes of flooding in order to determine which neighborhoods would be affected and their respective areas. Another analysis was to perform the intersection of the statement of the council buildings with the simulations to determine the number of homes affected by flooding simulated. The results showed high susceptibility to flooding of urban perimeter, especially the neighborhood bar, which for the simulation of a <b>flood</b> of 192 <b>meters,</b> had 27. 46 % of its area flooded and about 1443 buildings affected.

The Río Aculhuacán broke through its dikes, flooding the entire city from 1 to 2 meters deep. Transportation was by canoe, and many families left the city permanently. The rains continued, and the flood waters did not recede. Probably 30,000 persons died, and it was feared that the capital might disappear completely. Parts of the city remained flooded for four years. On May 19, 1630, the viceroy ordered the capital moved to Tacubaya, nearby but on higher ground, pending an open discussion in the guilds of the city. The guilds were opposed, resolving instead to restart the engineering works. By the end of the year, the engineer Enrico Martínez had restarted the work. By 1632 the Huehuetoca canal had finally been completed and the Calzada de San Cristóbal, atop a wall surrounding the city that served as a dike, had been renovated.|$|R
40|$|Taiwan {{is ranked}} {{as the country}} most exposed to {{multiple}} hazards (The World Bank 2005). Taipei City is the capital city {{as well as the}} economic and political center of Taiwan. The United Nations report World Urbanization Prospects: The 2011 Revision places Taipei City third on the list of the world’s top 10 urban areas exposed to three or more natural hazards, with the highest risk of cyclones, floods, and landslides. In order to gauge the vulnerabilities and damages of Taiwan and Taipei City, this research creates a natural disaster density indicator (NDDI) to conduct a comparative study of Taiwan, Japan, China, U. S. A., U. K., France, and the Netherlands over the past three decades. The results indicate that Taiwan has both the highest disaster occurrence and highest death toll among these seven countries. The Taipei case study, a chronology of policies implemented to prevent flooding, explains that costly engineering structures, rebuilding, and fortification against floods eventually created a false sense of security, which has encouraged more intensive residential and commercial developments in flood-prone areas, and led to a higher level of vulnerability. ^ This research further simulates and evaluates the vulnerabilities of population, land value, properties, GDP, and critical facilities in three scenarios: heavy rainfall, typhoon conditions, and extreme weather rainfall, through the technology of Geographic Information System (GIS) by using ArcMap 10. 2. 2 software. The results indicate 40 % of Taipei City is located in flood risk areas in an extreme weather scenario. This percentage is higher than other global cities such as London’s 15 %, Tokyo’s 10 %, and New York City’s 25 %. Based on the 10 % of total flooding areas above 0. 5 meter, the vulnerable population is estimated at 200, 000 people, or 7 % of the total population. The GDP impact will be more than $ 28 billion. More than $ 67 billion of land value is vulnerable. A least one million subway passengers will be impacted each day. There is little evidence that the urban poor are particularly vulnerable to floods. On the contrary, some neighborhoods with high income households face a higher risk of floods. Very few medical centers, oil and gas stations, and electrical power substations are located in flood-prone areas, but, a large number of public schools, administrative buildings, and major subway stations are susceptible. Additionally, the likelihood analysis of flooding in an extreme weather rainfall scenario concludes that the possibility will be five times that of the existing assumption with a flood in every 200 years. Thus, Taipei City’s infrequent once-in-two-century floods are likely to occur more frequently. Further, the 1 % of Taipei metropolitan region <b>flooding</b> above 1 <b>meter</b> will possibly cost up to $ 1. 5 billion in damages. Therefore, in the future, rather than strengthening and rebuilding costly structures, Taipei should focus on land-use and environmental planning for resilience. Urban policies should include environmentally responsible development in the face of continued population and economic growth, and being resilient regarding natural disasters. Most important is the need of a strong political commitment and leadership to initiate and implement urban policies toward resilience. In doing so, resilience can be achieved in Taipei. ...|$|R
