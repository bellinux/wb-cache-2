5|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} the new command centre was a large liquid crystal display which displayed information regarding the air conditioning unit and sound system. Buyers could opt for a premium sound package, standard on the Fairmont Ghia, which included a full-colour screen. Ventilation outlets were larger than those of previous models, resulting in a cabin that could be more effectively and efficiently heated or cooled. Another change was the <b>headlamp</b> <b>switch,</b> which was now located {{on the end of}} the turn signal stalk for easier reach.|$|E
25|$|Headlight {{flashing}} {{might have}} come into more common use {{as a means of}} attempting driver-to-driver communication by the mid-1970s, when cars began to come with headlight beam selectors located on the steering column—typically activated by pulling the turn signal stalk—rather than the previous foot-operated pushbutton switches. The signal stalk configuration was later wired to permit the momentary activation of the high beams regardless of whether the <b>headlamp</b> <b>switch</b> was turned on or off.|$|E

50|$|The {{gear change}} was {{mounted on the}} {{steering}} column. The direction indicator switch was mounted in the instrument panel. The <b>headlamp</b> dip <b>switch</b> was foot operated. The starter switch was push-operated and mounted on the floor panel below the handbrake.|$|R
50|$|A new AM/FM stereo {{radio with}} {{cassette}} tape player, {{as well as}} Ford's new top-of-the-line Electronic AM/FM Stereo Search Radio with Quadrasonic 8-track tape player, were added as new radio options. The latter received a floor-mounted foot-switch (inboard of the physically identical floor-mounted <b>headlamp</b> dimmer <b>switch),</b> which would allow the driver to left-foot-tap the switch to scan radio stations or advance tracks on the 8-track player, without having to take their hands off the steering wheel.|$|R
5000|$|The basic {{architecture}} of the Silver Cloud II did not change between 1959 and 1963, but there were numerous minor changes implemented, notable among them a succession of improvements to the ventilation system. [...] Interior changes in 1961 included the adoption of blue instrument lighting, {{the introduction of a}} combined indicator / <b>headlamp</b> flasher <b>switch</b> and of a handbrake warning light. A remodelled rear light assembly was introduced in May 1962 and a change to single sealed-beam headlamps was made in August 1962.|$|R
50|$|In 1968, the US Department of Transportation outlawed any {{decorative}} or protective {{element in}} front of the headlamps if the <b>headlamps</b> are <b>switched</b> on. Glass-covered <b>headlamps,</b> like those used on the Jaguar E-Type, the pre-1968 VW Beetle, the Porsche 356, the Citroën DS and Ferrari Daytona, now had to be equipped with uncovered headlamps for the US market, further altering the look of European models sold in the United States. The change meant that vehicles designed for solid aerodynamic performance could not achieve it for the US market.|$|R
50|$|The new Cutlass Salon was {{an upscale}} Euro-style luxury/sports sedan similar in concept to the Pontiac Grand Am of the era. The Salon, which {{included}} {{items such as}} uprated suspension, radial tires, reclining bucket seats and hand-operated <b>headlamp</b> dimmer <b>switch</b> (integral to the turn signal lever) {{was based on the}} Cutlass Supreme series, first as a 4-door Colonnade sedan, joined by a 2-door Colonnade hardtop coupe in 1974. The Cutlass Salon was the first Oldsmobile with the international-flags emblem, later carried on the Cutlass Ciera. Front disc brakes were standard.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} specification includes twelve volt lighting, electrically operated dip and <b>switch</b> <b>headlamps</b> and combined stop and tail lamps, single wiper with provision {{for a second}} blade, chrome finish on all bright parts, petrol gauge, bumpers etc. There is a concealed spare wheel under a metal cover on the back panel and a fold-down luggage grid.|$|R
25|$|In 1968 when Federal auto {{equipment}} and safety regulations were initiated, {{the requirement for}} two large or four small round sealed beams was codified, freezing headlamp design for many years. At the same time, the new regulations prohibited any decorative or protective element {{in front of the}} headlamps whenever the <b>headlamps</b> are <b>switched</b> on. Glass-covered <b>headlamps,</b> used on e.g. the Jaguar E-Type, pre-1968 VW Beetle, 1965 Chrysler and Imperial models, Porsche 356, Citroën DS and Ferrari Daytona were no longer permitted and vehicles had to be imported with uncovered headlamps for the US market. This change meant that vehicles with headlamp configurations designed for good aerodynamic performance could not achieve it for the US market.|$|R
5000|$|The first styling change came in August 1934 with {{a change}} to the {{radiator}} when the plated surround or cowl was replaced by one painted in body colour and it was given a slight slope. Synchromesh was added to second gear and dual screenwipers, flush-fitting self-cancelling trafficators (worked by the steering) and a foot-operated <b>headlamp</b> dip <b>switch</b> were fitted. The engine controls were simplified by the adoption of automatic ignition, compensated voltage control, {{and the provision of}} a [...] "choke" [...] (combined strangler and throttle control). The saloon was given the name Lichfield and got a protruding boot which enclosed the spare wheel. During 1935 the friction dampers were replaced with hydraulic dampers.|$|R
5000|$|For 1999, the Mustang also {{received}} a change to its taillights, making them edgier, with sharp corners and straight lines {{as opposed to the}} rounded off style of previous years. The lamps were still composed of three vertical segments, reminiscent of the original. Minimal changes occurred from year-to-year, most noticeable was a redesigned center panel in the dashboard for 2001, which now allowed double-din stereo head units, including an in-dash six-CD player. The rear window defroster switch, previously mounted below the <b>headlamp</b> pull <b>switch,</b> was moved to the lower center stack below the stereo. When equipped, the fog lamp switch was relocated to the lower center stack as well, previously, it was on the center console adjacent to the cup holders. The third button on the lower switch panel was for the traction control system (on V8 models). On convertible models, the power roof switch remained on the center console - on coupe models, that switch was replaced with a small coin holder.|$|R
5000|$|Bonatti and Hunza climber, Amir Mehdi, {{climbed up}} to deliver oxygen to Compagnoni and Lacedilli for their summit attempt. It was an epic climb {{with the weight}} of the oxygen bottles at that {{altitude}} and both men were exhausted. Bonatti and Mehdi arrived in failing light at a point on the [...] "shoulder" [...] at 26000 ft (7925 m) where the team had agreed to place camp IX. To their surprise the camp was not there. Alarmed, Bonatti and Mehdi called out to Compagnoni and Lacedilli who eventually answered from a site further up and left on the mountain, instructing Bonatti to leave the bottles and descend down the mountain. Bonatti could see the headlamp shining from the site over a difficult traverse in the dark, 600 ft away. Bonatti pleaded with Compagnoni and Lacedilli to join them in the camp. The <b>headlamp</b> abruptly <b>switched</b> off and despite continue pleas from Bonatti and Mehdi, Compagnoni and Lacedilli remain silent, sentencing Bonatti and Mehdi to an unplanned bivouac at 26000 ft in the open.|$|R
