50|$|Both compression-driven and blast-driven shock {{tubes are}} {{currently}} used for scientific {{as well as}} military applications. Compressed-gas driven shock tubes are more easily obtained and maintained in laboratory conditions; however, {{the shape of the}} pressure wave is different from a blast wave in some important respects and may not be suitable for some applications. Blast-driven shock tubes generate pressure waves that are more realistic to free-field blast waves. However, they require facilities and expert personnel for handling high explosives. Also, in addition to the initial pressure wave, a <b>jet</b> <b>effect</b> caused by the expansion of compressed gases (compression-driven) or production of rapidly expanding gases (blast-driven) follows and may transfer momentum to a sample after the blast wave has passed. More recently, laboratory scale shock tubes driven by fuel-air mixtures have been developed that produce realistic blast waves and can be operated in more ordinary laboratory facilities. Because the molar volume of gas is much less, the <b>jet</b> <b>effect</b> is a fraction of that for compressed-gas driven shock tubes. To date, the smaller size and lower peak pressures generated by these shock tubes make them most useful for preliminary, nondestructive testing of materials, validation of measurement equipment such as high speed pressure transducers, and for biomedical research as well as military applications.|$|E

5000|$|The bubble <b>jet</b> <b>effect</b> {{occurs when}} a mine or torpedo detonates in the water a short {{distance}} away from the targeted ship. The explosion creates a bubble in the water, and due to the difference in pressure, the bubble will collapse from the bottom. The bubble is buoyant and so it rises towards the surface. If the bubble reaches the surface as it collapses it can create a pillar of water that can go over a hundred meters into the air (a [...] "columnar plume"). If conditions are right and the bubble collapses onto the ship's hull, the damage to the ship can be extremely serious; the collapsing bubble forms a high energy jet that can break a meter wide hole straight through the ship, flooding one or more compartments, and is capable of breaking smaller ships apart. The crew in the areas hit by the pillar are usually killed instantly. Other damage is usually limited.|$|E

40|$|Observations of the {{extraordinarily}} bright optical afterglow (OA) of GRB 991208 started 2. 1 d {{after the}} event. The flux decay constant of the OA in the R-band is - 2. 30 +/- 0. 07 up to 5 d, {{which is very}} likely due to the <b>jet</b> <b>effect,</b> and {{after that it is}} followed by a much steeper decay with constant - 3. 2 +/- 0. 2, the fastest one ever seen in a GRB OA. A negative detection in several all-sky films taken simultaneously to the event implies either a previous additional break prior to 2 d after the occurrence of the GRB (as expected from the <b>jet</b> <b>effect).</b> The existence of a second break might indicate a steepening in the electron spectrum or the superposition of two events. Once the afterglow emission vanished, contribution of a bright underlying SN is found, but the light curve is not sufficiently well sampled to rule out a dust echo explanation. Our determination of z = 0. 706 indicates that GRB 991208 is at 3. 7 Gpc, implying an isotropic energy release of 1. 15 x 10 E 53 erg which may be relaxed by beaming by a factor > 100. Precise astrometry indicates that the GRB coincides within 0. 2 ' with the host galaxy, thus given support to a massive star origin. The absolute magnitude is M_B = - 18. 2, well below the knee of the galaxy luminosity function and we derive a star-forming rate of 11. 5 +/- 7. 1 Mo/yr.

40|$|An {{acoustic}} analogy {{methodology for}} improving noise predictions in hot round jets is presented. Past approaches have often neglected {{the impact of}} temperature fluctuations on the predicted sound spectral density, which could be significant for heated jets, and this has yielded noticeable acoustic under-predictions in such cases. The governing acoustic equations adopted here are a set of linearized, inhomogeneous Euler equations. These equations are combined into a single third order linear wave operator when the base flow is considered as a locally parallel mean flow. The remaining second-order fluctuations are regarded as the equivalent sources of sound and are modeled. It is shown that the hot <b>jet</b> <b>effect</b> may be introduced primarily through a fluctuating velocity/enthalpy term. Modeling this additional source requires specialized inputs from a RANS-based flowfield simulation. The information is supplied using an extension to a baseline two equation turbulence model that predicts total enthalpy variance {{in addition to the}} standard parameters.
