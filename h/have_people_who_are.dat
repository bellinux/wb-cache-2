5000|$|Good Morning Football {{replaced}} earlier {{attempts by}} NFL Network at a morning television program, including NFL AM and NFL HQ. Unlike its predecessors, which were filmed in Los Angeles, {{the show is}} produced live in the CBS Broadcast Center in New York City. The move was made, in part, because doing the show live from Los Angeles required the live broadcasts begin at 4 a.m. Pacific Time.

[...] Ellison, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> originally told about the Qur'an from an anonymous letter, spoke to the Associated Press in a phone interview.

A visionary like Thomas Jefferson was not afraid of a different belief system", Ellison said.

5000|$|More recently, in his chapter titled [...] "If the Devil Did Not Exist, It May Be Necessary to Invent Him in Certain Contexts" [...] {{published}} in a book titled, Philosophical Approaches to the Devil, through Routledge's Studies in the Philosophy of Religion series, Arp argues not only that Voltaire's claim, [...] "If God did not exist, {{it would be necessary}} to invent Him" [...] is probably false given the preponderance of non-theistic ethical systems, but also that the claim [...] "If the Devil did not exist, it would be necessary to invent Him" [...] is false as well. However, he does argue that it is [...] "not unreasonable to utilize God and the Devil as makeshifts for psychological comfort and social order, given a context in which we <b>have</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> not able to self-soothe or act correctly without the fear of God's judgment and the Devil's pitchfork. So, the upshot is that if God and the Devil did not exist—or do not exist—it may be necessary to invent them in certain contexts." ...|$|E
5000|$|Khaleque Biswas is {{a highly}} {{intelligent}} person. He can condemn the government of Sheikh Mujib in the most attacking manner, and he can also protect it with confidence and evidence, which makes him unreliable as a character. He is also an extremely arrogant person, who believes the world belongs to only those who can think, speak and prosper. In Chapter 13 of Book 2, he says: [...] "It is not mandatory... that a society must <b>have</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> vile and who rear filthiness instead of grit and ambition... All the able and intelligent men in the country, people who are creative and do not surrender {{to the demands of}} hungry stomachs, should rush to this camp at this very moment to burn these tents down, to peel the skin off these shameless human animals. Sheikh Mujib should pass the necessary orders to his militiamen to dig a deep trench to bury all the faint-hearted people alive, thus ushering in a new era for the intelligent to grow up with beautiful minds, and help advance this country. It does not matter how many unfit ones are buried to nurture the fit ones; those who cannot fight for a sustainable existence should perish without mercy." ...|$|E
5000|$|There {{have been}} {{attempts}} to link Coral Ridge Ministries, and Kennedy by association, to Christian Reconstructionists. Though Kennedy has hosted Christian Reconstructionists Rousas John Rushdoony and Gary North on his {{program in the}} 1980s, he has rejected attempts to link him to Reconstructionist or Dominionism movements. “I am not advocating a theocracy,” Kennedy (and co-author Jerry Newcombe) state in How Would Jesus Vote: A Christian Perspective on the Issues. “I would not have America reinstitute the Old Testament civil and legal systems to replace our governmental legislation.” He denounced in the late 1980s any attempts to link him to Reconstructionist or Dominionism movement as a McCarthyist technique of guilt by association, and {{said he does not}} approve of their theology. Critic Frederick Clarkson argues that despite his denial, Kennedy meets Clarkson's criteria for being a dominionist. In an interview with NPR's Terry Gross, host of the program Fresh Air, Kennedy cast his objectives within a democratic framework. Asked whether he wanted all public office holders to be Christians, Kennedy answered, [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> secular and humanist and unbelievers who are constantly supporting in every way possible other people who share those views. And I don't object to that. That's their privilege. And I think that Christians should be allowed the same privilege to vote for people whom they believe share their views about life and government. And that's all I'm talking about." ...|$|E

That same day, during his oath reenactment, Ellison used a two-volume Qur'an once owned by Thomas Jefferson, borrowed from the rare book and special collections division of the Library of Congress. Ellison said that the use of the Jefferson Qur'an demonstrated [...] "that {{from the very beginning of}} our country, we <b>had</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> visionary, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> religiously tolerant, <b>who</b> believed that knowledge and wisdom could be gleaned from any number of sources, including the Qur'an."

Meanwhile, in June of the same year, he confirmed a new album, the rest of the Believe Tour and a movie for 2013. In July, Braun gave an interview for MTV News, where he discussed the album, claiming: [...] "For this project, we want to do things a little bit differently. And there are more songs than 10 or 12, so if you have more music and you have more things you want to express, you gotta think out the box, and like ’How do I get this out there in a unique way where it gets directly to my fans and I can express myself through music directly to them?’ And I think that’s what it’s about when you <b>have</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> incredibly creative, things happen."

There was no studio interference with casting more unknowns, as Wright stated that [...] "Universal never really gave me any problems about casting bigger people, because in a way Michael Cera has starred in two $100 million-plus movies, and {{also a lot of}} the other people, though they're not the biggest names, people certainly know who they are." [...] Wright planned on casting Cera while writing Hot Fuzz after watching episodes of Arrested Development. Wright said he needed an actor that [...] "audiences will still follow even when the character is being a bit of an ass." [...] Wright ran all his casting decisions by O'Malley during the casting session. Mary Elizabeth Winstead was Wright's choice for Ramona Flowers two years before filming had started, because [...] "she has a very sunny disposition as a person, so it was interesting to get her to play a version of herself that was broken inside. She's great in the film because she causes a lot of chaos but remains supernaturally grounded." [...] Ellen Wong, a Toronto actress known mostly from a role in This Is Wonderland, auditioned for the part of Knives Chau three times. On her second audition, Wright learned that Wong has a green belt in tae kwon do, and says he found himself intrigued by this [...] "sweet-faced young lady being a secret badass".|$|E
