50|$|A submerge-arc <b>furnace's</b> <b>shell</b> or casing is {{fabricated}} from steel. The {{lower part}} {{is lined with}} hard blocks of strongly calcined carbon, and the upper part with firebrick. The floor and lower section of the furnace are water-cooled. Three electrodes are placed at the angles of an equilateral triangle with rounded corners. These furnaces can be equipped with either pre-baked electrodes or Söderberg electrodes. The Söderberg electrodes are heated by the electric current and the furnace heat, then baked solid {{in the region of}} the contact clamps. The electrode must become baked solid over its entire cross section (inside the charge) when it is fed downwards to compensate for its consumption in the furnace (which is a few centimeters per hour).|$|R

50|$|The furnace is {{completely}} emptied {{of steel and}} slag {{on a regular basis}} so that an inspection of the refractories can be made and larger repairs made if necessary. As the refractories are often made from calcined carbonates, they are extremely susceptible to hydration from water, so any suspected leaks from water-cooled components are treated extremely seriously, beyond the immediate concern of potential steam explosions. Excessive refractory wear can lead to breakouts, where the liquid metal and slag penetrate the refractory and <b>furnace</b> <b>shell</b> and escape into the surrounding areas.|$|E
5000|$|Smaller arc {{furnaces}} may {{be adequately}} cooled by circulation of air over structural {{elements of the}} shell and roof, but larger installations require intensive forced cooling to maintain the structure within safe operating limits. The <b>furnace</b> <b>shell</b> and roof may be cooled either by water circulated through pipes which form a panel, or by water sprayed on the panel elements. Tubular panels may be replaced when they become cracked or reach their thermal stress life cycle. Spray cooling is the most economical and is the highest efficiency cooling method. A spray cooling piece of equipment can be relined almost endlessly; equipment that lasts 20 years is the norm. However while a tubular leak is immediately noticed in an operating furnace due to the pressure loss alarms on the panels, at this time there exists no immediate way of detecting a very small volume spray cooling leak. These typically hide behind slag coverage and can hydrate the refractory in the hearth leading to a break out of molten metal or in the worst case a steam explosion.|$|E
50|$|Second {{archaeological site}} of Chanhu jo daro is {{situated}} in village Jamal Keerio, Taluka Sakrand. This archaeological site belonging to the post-urban Jhukar phase of Indus valley civilization. The site is located 130 km (81 mi) south of Mohenjo-daro {{near the village of}} Jamal Keryo 2 km from Rohri canal and 10 km south of Nawabshah. The settlement was inhabited between 4000 and 1700 BCE, and is considered to have been a center for manufacturing carnelian beads. This site is a group of three low mounds that excavations have shown were parts of a single settlement, approximately 5 hectares in size. This is one of most important and bigger sites of Indus Civilization. It {{is situated in}} a desert area, but it is believed that the Sarasvati River used to flow near this site. Sarasvati River is believed to have dried up during 2nd millennium BC, causing the life at Chanhu jo daro and several hundreds of dwellings situated on the banks of Sarasvati to become very difficult. The people there probably had to abandon their houses for that reason which led to decline of these dwellings (cities and villages) which in turn contributed to the decline of Indus Civilization itself. For building houses, baked bricks were used extensively at Chanhu jo daro - similar to Mohenjo-daro. Several constructions were identified as workshops or industrial quarters and some of the buildings of Chanhu jo daro might have been warehouses. An impressive workshop, recognized as Bead Making Factory, was found at Chanhu jo daro which included a <b>furnace.</b> <b>Shell</b> bangles, beads of many materials, stealite seals and metal works were also manufactured here.|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the use of}} novel techniques for heat containment {{that could be used}} to build a high temperature transparent furnace. The primary objective of the work was to experimentally demonstrate transparent furnace operation at 1200 C. Secondary objectives were to understand furnace operation and furnace component specification to enable the design and construction of a low power prototype furnace for delivery to NASA in a follow-up project. The basic approach of the research was to couple high temperature component design with simple concept demonstration experiments that modify a commercially available transparent furnace rated at lower temperature. A detailed energy balance of the operating transparent furnace was performed, calculating heat losses through the furnace components as a result of conduction, radiation, and convection. The transparent <b>furnace</b> <b>shells</b> and <b>furnace</b> components were redesigned to permit furnace operation at at least 1200 C. Techniques were developed that are expected to lead to significantly improved heat containment compared with current transparent furnaces. The design of a thermal profile in a multizone high temperature transparent furnace design was also addressed. Experiments were performed to verify the energy balance analysis, to demonstrate some of the major furnace improvement techniques developed, and to demonstrate the overall feasibility of a high temperature transparent furnace. The important objective of the research was achieved: to demonstrate the feasibility of operating a transparent furnace at 1200 C...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{received}} another {{batch of}} polystyrene ballistic <b>furnace</b> <b>shells</b> on December 4, 1998. Assigned the batch number of LSC 012, {{it consisted of}} three cassettes containing 36 shells in each cassette. A group of 27 of the shells were selected for characterization that ranged in diameter from 1880 to 1780 {micro}m. There were two shells with a diameter above 1900 {micro}m, but they were too fragile and did not survive initial handling. For characterization, they examined the shells through a stereo microscope, measured diameter and sphericity on RACI, and weighed {{a subset of the}} 27 shells that did not have large particles or polymer shards adhered to the outside in order to calculate wall thickness. They then selected the cleanest and most spherical shells for Sphere Mapping. This batch of shells has about the same physical appearance as the one they documented August 26, 1998. There were some shells with polymer shards adhered to the outside, a few large vacuoles or large particle embedded in the polymer wall, and some with a scattering of small black particles on the outside. There were no swirls in the shell walls. As mentioned in the previous report, each shell is measured with the RACI system in three orthogonal views. They now have new analysis software on RACI that returns the mode two amplitude of the sphere radius vs. angle of rotation {{around the edge of the}} shadowgram of the shell. From this they report the maximum radius out-of-round, the largest of the three different orientations...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{findings}} of a study of a statistically representative sample of 299 single-family, owner-occupied homes in Wisconsin. On-site audit data, homeowner surveys, and utility billing data were collected to characterize energy-related aspects of owner-occupied housing in the state. The study shows that the average Wisconsin homeowner pays about $ 1300 annually in energy costs. Low-income homes are smaller but more energy intensive to heat. New homes are more energy efficient but also larger; both of these subgroups pay about the same total for annual energy costs. About 40 percent of homes in Wisconsin have a major cost-effective energy efficiency opportunity such as wall insulation, infiltration reduction or an older inefficient <b>furnace.</b> Building <b>shell</b> opportunities tend to be concentrated in older homes, and are also associated with homeowners who state that they have plans to remodel in the near future and homeowners who report winter comfort problems.

The prepared activated carbon was then placed to desiccators to cool down to room temperature. Characterization of the sorbent was done properly using different instrumental techniques such as SEM, BET, FTIR and point of zero charge.|$|R
5000|$|Ben-my-Chree {{was driven}} by three Parsons steam {{turbines}} which were built under licence by Vickers Sons and Maxim, the turbines developing 14,000 shaft horsepower, thereby resulting in a designed service speed of 24.5 knots. The turbines were so arranged so as to work in series, with one high-pressure ahead turbine driving the centre shaft, and two low-pressure ahead turbines driving their respective wing shaft. Astern turbines were incorporated in the casing, with each low-pressure turbine fitted with valves to control the admission of steam for ahead and astern working. These manoeuvring valves were independent of the high-pressure turbine which would run idle when the ship was manoeuvring. The valve gear was arranged for easy operation and was placed at the forward end of the high-pressure turbine. The main valves were of the vertical equilibrium type operated by large handwheels.

40|$|Three {{dimensional}} printing is a {{rapid prototyping}} process that forms parts {{directly from a}} computer model by joining powdered material with a binder. The green part so obtained is subjected to post processing steps that include debinding, sintering and infiltration.

40|$|Journal articleThis review {{examines}} the utilisation of waste products from three sectors (industry, agriculture, and construction and demolition) in filters {{for the removal}} of contaminants from water. Sand is commonly used in drinking water filtration in water treatment plants. However, the use of alternative, low-cost materials could address the limitations of sand, particularly {{for the removal of}} emerging contaminants, and address European legislation which fosters the development of a circular economy, in which materials are used effectively. This review assesses the suitability of potential media by quantifying their adsorption potential across a variety of common drinking water contaminants. The media investigated were fly ash, Bayer residue, ground granular blast <b>furnace</b> slag, coconut <b>shell,</b> tea/coffee waste, rice husk, crushed concrete, masonry waste, and wood waste. There is a potential for the use of these media in the water treatment sector, although certain precautions must be taken to ensure any concerns are mitigated, such as release of metals into water. Recommendations, following this review, include testing the media in large-scale applications, and also constructing filters so as potential media are placed in layers to harness their contrasting adsorptive potentials.

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} {{portrays the}} pilot implementation of Six Sigma DMAIC (Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control) phases {{to improve the}} effectiveness of shell and tube heat exchanger in a small sized <b>furnace</b> manufacturing company. <b>Shell</b> and tube heat exchanger {{is one of the}} critical components of the furnace. The imperative objective is {{to improve the quality of}} the furnace through DMAIC phases. In define phase, the critical to quality (CTQ) parameter was identified as effectiveness in shell and tube heat exchanger through the voice of the customer (VOC) and Pareto Chart. In measure phase, the present effectiveness was measured as 0. 61. In analysis phase, the reason for the reduction of effectiveness was identified as less heat transfer area through cause and effect diagram. In improve phase, the existing design was modified through various alternative solutions by conducting brainstorming sessions. In this phase, the solution was identified with the introduction of circular fins over the bare tubes to improve the effectiveness in the shell and tube heat exchanger. Consequently, the effectiveness has been enhanced from 0. 61 to 0. 664. In control phase, the control strategies were recommended to sustain the improvements in shell and tube heat exchanger. In the end, the annual monetary savings of Rs. 0. 34 million were achieved through the implementation of DMAIC phases in the furnace manufacturing company...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the ability of}} five low cost adsorbent/reactive materials to remove Zn, Pb and Cd from Fe-poor, circum-neutral pH metal mine water in mid-Wales, UK. Compost, iron ochre, basic oxygen furnace slag (BOS) blended with blast <b>furnace</b> slag, waste <b>shell</b> material and fly ash were used {{in a series of}} small-scale passive treatment cells to assess metal removal from mine drainage initially containing, on average, 23. 5 mg/L Zn, 550 mu g/L Pb and 50 mu g/L Cd. Treatment plants contained between 2 and 20 kg of reactive media, with a 15 minute residence time and treated up to 1 L/minute. Fly ash from a peat fired power station was found to be the most effective material for metal removal, with over 99. 0 Zn, Pb and Cd removed from over woo litres of water. The other materials tested initially achieved high levels of metal removal (with between 75 and 99. 9 % Zn, Pb and Cd removed), however all of the materials saturated with Zn after less than 200 litres of water had been treated. The results of the pilot-scale field trials can be scaled to demonstrate that a modest sized fly ash treatment cell only 2. 7 x 2. 7 x 1 metres in size would be sufficient to remove 90 % of the total metal load from this mine (10 L/minute) for a one year period...|$|R
