5|$|For {{several weeks}} Lamason {{negotiated}} with the camp authorities to have the airmen transferred to a POW camp, but his requests were denied. At great risk, Lamason secretly <b>got</b> <b>word</b> to the Luftwaffe of the Allied airmen's captivity and, seven days before their scheduled execution, 156 of the 168 prisoners were transferred to Stalag Luft III. Most of the airmen credit their survival at Buchenwald to the leadership and determination of Lamason. After the war, he moved to Dannevirke and became a farmer until his retirement. During the 1980s and 1990s, he was a regular speaker at KLB Club and POW reunions.|$|E

5|$|Garfield's {{promotion}} {{gave him}} {{command of the}} 20th Brigade of the Army of the Ohio, which was ordered in early 1862 to join Major General Ulysses S. Grant's forces as they advanced on Corinth, Mississippi. Before the 20th Brigade arrived, however, Confederate forces under General Albert Sidney Johnston surprised Grant's men in their camps, driving them back. Garfield's troops <b>got</b> <b>word</b> of the battle and advanced quickly, joining {{the rest of the}} army on the second day to drive the Confederates back across the field and into retreat. The action, later known as the Battle of Shiloh, was the bloodiest of the war to date; Garfield was exposed to fire for much of the day, but emerged uninjured. Major General Henry W. Halleck, Grant's superior, took charge of the combined armies and advanced ponderously toward Corinth; when they arrived, the Confederates had fled.|$|E
5|$|After the 1897 {{baseball}} season, {{he returned}} to his home in Portland, Oregon with his health deteriorating. In December, Parrott traveled to New Mexico in hopes of re-gaining his health. When in New Mexico, he reported that the weather was too cold and that he was planning to move to Arizona where the climate is more mild. On April 14, 1898, while in a hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, Parrott died of tuberculosis. Earlier that day, Parrott had telegraphed his father, Thomas H. Parrott, back in Portland alerting him that it was not likely he would live two more days. Upon receiving the telegram, Thomas H. Parrott sent his son, Archie Parrott, on a train to Arizona to be with the dying Jiggs Parrott. However, after the train left the station in Portland, the Parrott family <b>got</b> <b>word</b> that Jiggs Parrott had died. Archie Parrott continued to Arizona to retrieve his brother's remains. His remains were returned on April 23. Parrott's funeral was held on April 25, at his home in East Portland. His pall-bearers were several former teammates from the Portland Willamettes: Joseph Beveridge, Charles Neale, Frank Buchtel, William Kern, Fred Bailey, and John Rankin. According to The Oregonian hundreds attended his funeral and 500 people attended his burial at Lone Fir Cemetery in Portland.|$|E
5|$|On 19 February, General Smith <b>got</b> <b>word</b> {{that the}} Peshwa {{was headed for}} Pandharpur. General Smith's troops {{attacked}} the Peshwa at Ashti en route. During this battle, Gokhale died while defending the Peshwa from the British. The Raja of Satara was captured along with his brother and mother. The Maratha king, first imprisoned by Tarabai in the 1750s had lost power much earlier but was reinstated by Madhav rao Peshwa in 1763 after Tarabai's death. Since then the king had retained a titular position of appointing the Peshwas. The Emperor Alamgir II in his farman to the Peshwa had complimented them for looking after the Chhatrapati family. The Chhatrapati declared in favour of the British and this ended the Peshwa's legal position {{as head of the}} Maratha confederacy, this was done by a jahirnama which stated Peshwas were no longer the head of the Maratha confederacy. However Baji Rao II challenged the jahirnama of removing him from his position as Peshwa by issuing another jahirnama removing Mountstuart Elphinstone as British Resident to his state. The death of Gokhale and the skirmish at Ashti hastened the end of the war. Soon after this Baji Rao was deserted by the Patwardhans.|$|E

5|$|Being {{somewhat}} delayed, Charles {{broke up}} his winter quarters at Blonie on January 9, 1706 and approached Grodno {{with the main}} Swedish army of 20,000 men and the 10,000 Poles and Lithuanians. A Russian army of 28,000 men was stationed there. Bad weather prevented him from marching out earlier. Urgently seeking battle Charles seemed to walk straight into the trap the allies had set for him, according to their initial plan. In Saxony, Schulenburg still waited with his 20,000 men to cross the Polish border and engage Rehnskiöld. He planned to move with his army {{as soon as he}} <b>got</b> <b>word</b> of Charles crossing the Vistula river. However, Charles commenced with a rapid winter march; this was typical for the Swedes, dating back to the time of Gustavus Adolphus, but quite unusual for continental armies. This in turn surprised the allies as they believed Charles would not begin his march before spring. Having received word of his approach however, they considered three alternatives; to meet Charles' army in the open field, fortify in Grodno, or retreat. While they disagreed among themselves about their course of action Charles' army appeared before the fortifications of Grodno on January 24, after a quick march, forcing the allies to stay in the city. Prior to the Swedish arrival, Augustus who had thus far accompanied the Russian army, broke away with 5,000 cavalry. He strove to increase his troops with another 3,000 men before uniting forces with Sculenburg and the Saxon main army whose only obstacle in order to attack Charles' army in the rear, accordingly, were the 10,000 men under Rehnskiöld stationed at Poznań.|$|E
