40|$|Relevance {{feedback}} schemes use a given set <b>of</b> <b>descriptors</b> and at each feedback iteration {{they just}} modify the importance <b>of</b> each <b>descriptor</b> to the retrieval performance. This {{implies that the}} same type <b>of</b> <b>descriptors</b> is used for all feedback iterations. Therefore, such approaches cannot improve the retrieval performance beyond the efficiency <b>of</b> the <b>descriptors</b> used to represent the multimedia content. In this paper, an alternative concept is to adopt a progressive descriptor organization and to allow dynamic modification of the type <b>of</b> <b>descriptors</b> (expansion or shrink) at each retrieval iteration by exploiting the current user's information needs. In other words, descriptors that best fit the current user's preferences are expanded into more details, in constant to the descriptors that are far way from the user's needs which are shrinking. In this case, instead of using a large set <b>of</b> <b>descriptors,</b> most <b>of</b> them inappropriate {{with respect to the}} current user's information needs, a small number <b>of</b> dominant <b>descriptors</b> is selected for the retrieval process. Thus, the proposed approach significantly increases the precision performance by discarding descriptors that yield noise in the retrieval. © 2007 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{reinforcement}} learning approach for an adaptive selection {{and application of}} 3 D point cloud feature descriptors {{for the purpose of}} 3 D object classification. The result of the learning process is an autonomously learned strategy <b>of</b> selection <b>of</b> <b>descriptors</b> with the property that the successive application <b>of</b> these <b>descriptors</b> to a 3 D point cloud yields high classification rates among a large number of object classes. The order in which the descriptors are applied to an unfamiliar point cloud depends on the features calculated in previous steps <b>of</b> the <b>descriptor</b> sequence, i. e., the sequence <b>of</b> <b>descriptors</b> depends on the object to be classified, thus it is highly adaptive. Our approach starts with a given number <b>of</b> <b>descriptors</b> and object classes, but it is able to adapt dynamically to changes in the environment. For example, further descriptors can be added during the learning process, and new object classes are created autonomously if necessary. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{value of}} {{scientific}} articles titles and abstracts {{as sources of}} terms for documents indexing is studied in relation with six knowledge areas: Library and Information Science, Medicine, Chemistry, Biology and Physics, indexed in the databases ISOC, IME and ICYT of the CSIC. The sintagmatic structures of the indexing terms found in the field ‘Descriptors’ is also examined, as well {{the relation between the}} length of the documents and the number <b>of</b> <b>descriptors</b> it has. In orden to do this six searches were made in the databases for the six knowledge areas, and 450 bibliographical references were selected (75 for knowledge area), obtaining 2077 <b>descriptors,</b> <b>of</b> these, 38, 1 % appear in the titles, in the abstracts or in both. With respect to the sintactic structures it was found that 41, 9 % were ‘nouns’, 32, 3 % are ‘noun+adjective’ groups, and 11, 8 % are ‘noun+noun’ groups, with a 14 % for other different structures. Lastly, regarding the relationship between length of documents and number <b>of</b> <b>descriptors,</b> all possible combinations were found: short articles with a few descriptors, long articles with a small amount <b>of</b> <b>descriptors,</b> short articles with a important quantity <b>of</b> <b>descriptors,</b> and documents with a high number so much of pages as <b>of</b> <b>descriptors.</b> The following conclusions can be raised from the data obtained: first, if the abstracts are not well made and the titles are not precise, they are not definitives sources for the extraction of concepts; second, the most common syntactic structures is the ‘noun phrase’, followed by ‘noun+adjective’ and ‘noun+noun’; third, no significant relation is found between length of documents and number <b>of</b> <b>descriptors</b> assigned to it...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a new {{descriptor}} selection {{method for}} selecting an optimal combination <b>of</b> important <b>descriptors</b> <b>of</b> sulfonamide derivatives data, named self tuned reweighted sampling (STRS), is developed. descriptors {{are defined as}} the descriptors with large absolute coefficients in a multivariate linear regression model such as partial least squares(PLS). In this study, the absolute values of regression coefficients of PLS model are used as an index for evaluating the importance <b>of</b> each <b>descriptor</b> Then, based on the importance level <b>of</b> each <b>descriptor,</b> STRS sequentially selects N subsets <b>of</b> <b>descriptors</b> from N Monte Carlo (MC) sampling runs in an iterative and competitive manner. In each sampling run, a fixed ratio (e. g. 80 %) of samples is first randomly selected to establish a regresson model. Next, based on the regression coefficients, a two-step procedure including rapidly decreasing function (RDF) based enforced descriptor selection and self tuned sampling (STS) based competitive descriptor selection is adopted to select the important descriptorss. After running the loops, a number <b>of</b> subsets <b>of</b> <b>descriptors</b> are obtained and root mean squared error of cross validation (RMSECV) of PLS models established with subsets <b>of</b> <b>descriptors</b> is computed. The subset <b>of</b> <b>descriptors</b> with the lowest RMSECV is considered as the optimal descriptor subset. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by sulfanomide derivative dataset. The results reveal an good characteristic of STRS that it can usually locate an optimal combination <b>of</b> some important <b>descriptors</b> which are interpretable to the biologically of interest. Additionally, our study shows that better prediction is obtained by STRS when compared to full descriptor set PLS modeling, Monte Carlo uninformative variable elimination (MC-UVE).
