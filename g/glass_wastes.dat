Moreover we want to encourage the government to find solutions regarding the disposal to landfills of glassy waste materials and provide new knowledge to the contractors and developers on how to improve the construction industry methods and services by using glassy waste to sustain good product performance and meet recycling goals. Different kinds of <b>glass</b> <b>wastes</b> in the form of sub grain packaging glass cullet, CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) panel glass waste and calsi glass, were used as a sand replacement in AAC production. Large proportion of the post-consumer glass is recycled into the packaging stream again, but some sub grain packaging glass cullet does not meet the strict criteria for packaging glass thus is sent to landfill. CRT is classified as a hazardous glass waste and there are several issues surround CRTs which create barriers to increased recovery of the glass. In countries e. g. Latin America and Asia where still CRT glass is being produced even when shredder, the glass stream is a mixture of panel and funnel glass, making it difficult for reuse in new CRTs. Based on our knowledge also calsi glass as a processed blast furnace slag is not used in packaging production. The viability of current and novel applications of mentioned glasses is examined here. Although aerated concrete was initially envisaged as a good insulation material, there has been renewed interest in its structural characteristics in view of its lighter weight, savings in material and potential for large scale utilization of wastes. Due to this fact we undertake the studies of an influence of different amounts of <b>glass</b> <b>wastes</b> onto properties of aerated concrete in terms of physical (microstructure, density), mechanical (compressive and tensile strengths) and chemical characteristic. Use of milled waste glass in concrete as partial re-placement of sand represents an important step towards development of sustainable (environmentally friendly, energy-efficient and economic concrete-based infrastructure systems...|$|E

Currently, there is a large effort in progress to prepare to ship this waste to WIPP. In order to meet the TRU Waste Characterization Quality Assurance Program Plan nondestructive assay compliance requirements and quality assurance objectives, it is necessary to determine the total uncertainty of the radioassay results produced by the Stored Waste Examination Pilot Plant (SWEPP) Passive Action Neutron (PAN) radioassay system. This paper discusses a modified statistical sampling and verification approach used to determine the total uncertainty of SWEPP PAN measurements for <b>glass</b> <b>waste</b> (content codes 440, 441, and 442) contained in 208 liter drums. In the modified statistical sampling and verification approach, the total performance of the SWEPP PAN nondestructive assay system for specifically selected waste conditions is simulated using computer models. A set of 100 cases covering the known conditions exhibited in <b>glass</b> <b>waste</b> was compiled using a combined statistical sampling and factorial experimental design approach. Parameter values assigned in each simulation were derived from reviews of approximately 100 real-time radiography video tapes of RFP <b>glass</b> <b>waste</b> drums, results from previous SWEPP PAN measurements on <b>glass</b> <b>waste</b> drums, and shipping data from RFP where the <b>glass</b> <b>waste</b> was generated. The data in the 100 selected cases form the multi-parameter input to the simulation model. The reported plutonium masses from the simulation model are compared with corresponding input masses.

While the recovery of primary <b>glass</b> <b>waste</b> is already spread and technological known, the secondary <b>glass</b> <b>waste</b> (<b>glass</b> <b>waste</b> 2) is recovered by few companies in Italy from some years. Consequently the recovery of the waste of this secondary recovery process of <b>glass</b> <b>waste</b> is new (<b>glass</b> <b>waste</b> 3) and therefore to optimize, in order to reach an economic and sustainable industrial process solution. With the aim of optimizing the plant of SASIL already existing for the recovery of the "glass waste 3 ", innovative technologies have been studied and executed. The major difficulty is in the automatic separation of materials as plastic lightweight, synthetic stoppers and cork stoppers that can nowadays find a market. In particular the solved problem is the separation for materials whose density is < 1, using non-impacting methods. The particle distribution and characterization of the waste in entrance in plant and the products obtained in different stage of treatment have been used to dimension the new plant and to suggest new kind of treatment. Among the innovative process suggested two density separation have been performed: - separation by means jig concentrators; - separation of new method of bath suction. In this research the jig concentrator, at difference of the previous research don't use floatation principle but only fluid motion (without chemical addition and collectors). The same is for the "bath suction apparatus" that it needs only of water to execute the separation. The separation of efficiencies are major than 80 % both for jig concentrators, for the separation of heavy plastic and glass from plastic lightweight and synthetic stoppers and cork stoppers, and for bath suction apparatus that led to separate plastic lightweight from synthetic stoppers and cork stoppers.
