40|$|Postmodernism, {{with its}} {{interrogation}} {{of reality and}} the im/possibility of representation, presented a legitimation crisis for the documentary which would potentially signal the <b>end.</b> <b>Gauging</b> by the renewed interest in the documentary tradition (in theory and practice) {{it is obvious that}} postmodernism had the reverse effect on documentary, freeing a filmmaking practice that had become hopelessly trapped within its own representational contradictions. In response to the challenge postmodernism presented, documentary theorists and filmmakers cleared a new space for documentary, and in the process reconsidered the limitations of Western epistemology and the ideal of 'representing reality'. This new space is reflected in the renewed interest in a new and more self-reflexive documentary theory and practice from the early 1980 's onward. This essay will examine the transition which the documentary tradition has undergone in light of the shift from modernity to postmodernity: the shift from Grierson's heavily didactic social documentary to cinema verite and direct cinema and, finally, to the self-reflexive postmodern documentary. A textual analysis of Patricia Gruben's Leylines (1993), a recent postmodern documentary, will allow me to demonstrate how the contemporary documentary deals with the postmodern questions of history, representation, authority, knowledge, and subjectivity.

Unfortunately, optical forces are still {{too small for the}} convenient actuation of integrated switches and waveguide couplers.

To this <b>end,</b> the <b>gauge</b> materials inside the cores should emulate imaginary vector potentials for photons pointing perpendicularly to the waveguide plane. Depending on the relative orientation of the vector potentials in neighboring waveguides, i. e., pointing away from or towards each other, the conventional attractive force due to an even mode profile may be enhanced, suppressed, or may even become repulsive. This and other new features indicate that the implementation of complex-valued vector potentials with non-Hermitian waveguide cores may further enhance our control over mode profiles and the associated optical forces...|$|R

40|$|Magnetic vector {{potential}} (MVP) formulation combined with finite edge elements has gained substantial application in 3 -D eddy-current field computation. Compared with its magnetic scalar potential counterpart, the MVP formulation {{is much easier}} to treat multiply-connected conductors. With the availability of advanced direct linear solvers with high performance on parallel or multi-core platforms, it becomes more and more important to develop gauged MVP formulations. To this <b>end,</b> the <b>gauging</b> technique is essential to ensure that the MVP formulation is uniquely solvable by direct solvers. In this paper, a novel method for imposing Coulomb gauge to transient eddy-current problems using edge elements for approximating the MVP is proposed. The resultant linear matrix equation is symmetric and uniquely solvable. Current excitations and voltage excitations for stranded conductors and solid conductors are formulated, respectively. Field-circuit coupled scheme for solid conductors is also presented. Extensive numerical examples are computed using the proposed formulation, which has proved to be promising in further engineering applications.
