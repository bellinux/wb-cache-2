40|$|Abstract — Metal <b>fills,</b> {{which are}} used to reduce metal {{thickness}} variations due to chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP), increase the capacitances in a circuit. Although current extraction tools are accurate in handling grounded <b>fills</b> and regular interconnects, for floating <b>fills,</b> these tools are based on certain approximations, such as assuming that floating <b>fills</b> are grounded or each <b>fill</b> is merged with neighboring ones. To reduce such inaccuracies, we provide a design of experiments (DOE), which {{will be used in}} addition to what is available in the extraction tools for regular interconnects. Through the proposed DOE set, a design or mask house can generate normalized <b>fill</b> tables to remove the inaccuracies of the extraction tools in the presence of floating <b>fills.</b> The capacitance values are updated using these normalized <b>fill</b> tables. The proposed DOE enables extensive analyses of the <b>fill</b> impacts on coupling capacitances. We show through extensive 3 D field solver simulations that the assumptions used in extractors result in significant inaccuracies. We present analyses of <b>fill</b> impacts for an example technology, and also provide analyses using the normalized <b>fill</b> tables {{to be used in the}} extraction flow for three different standard <b>fill</b> algorithms.
