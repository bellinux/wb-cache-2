They do not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>far</b> Markinson was {{cooperating}} with Rhoemer and Phagan, but Gabe believes they may never know. In a post-credits scene, Aramov approaches a mysterious man inside the Agency headquarters and whispers something in his ear. He congratulates her while the camera pulls back to show PharCom boxes in the office.|$|E
5|$|Roman Academic Cotta ridicules both {{literal and}} allegorical {{acceptance}} of myth, declaring roundly that myths {{have no place}} in philosophy. Cicero is also generally disdainful of myth, but, like Varro, he is emphatic in his support for the state religion and its institutions. It is difficult to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>far</b> down the social scale this rationalism extended. Cicero asserts that no one (not even old women and boys) is so foolish as to believe in the terrors of Hades or the existence of Scyllas, centaurs or other composite creatures, but, on the other hand, the orator elsewhere complains of the superstitious and credulous character of the people. De Natura Deorum is the most comprehensive summary of Cicero's line of thought.|$|E
5|$|Green {{told police}} that she had one or two drinks after dinner and went to her bedroom, leaving it only to speak to Tim in the kitchen some time between ten and eleven in the evening, shortly {{before he went to}} bed. Kelly and Kate had gone to bed earlier, each taking one of the family's two dogs with them. Green said that she had fallen asleep around eleven-thirty. At some point before falling asleep, she recalled, she had spoken to Farrar, who had phoned asking which member of the {{household}} had paged him. She {{told police that}} she and Farrar {{were in the process of}} divorce, though she did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>far</b> along they were, and that although the children were very upset at the prospect, she herself was not and was looking forward to being able to rebuild her life.|$|E

25|$|Henry {{wished to}} <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>far</b> Muslim territories in Africa extended, hoping to bypass them and trade {{directly}} with West Africa by sea, find allies in legendary Christian lands {{to the south}} like the long-lost Christian kingdom of Prester John and to probe whether {{it was possible to}} reach the Indies by sea, the source of the lucrative spice trade. He invested in sponsoring voyages down the coast of Mauritania, gathering a group of merchants, shipowners and stakeholders interested in new sea lanes. Soon the Atlantic islands of Madeira (1419) and the Azores (1427) were reached. In particular, they were discovered by voyages launched by the command of Prince Henry the Navigator. The expedition leader himself, who established settlements on the island of Madeira, was João Gonçalves Zarco.|$|E
500|$|An {{unidentified}} {{crew member}} asked Powers, {{one of the}} students, for his compass reading. Powers replied: [...] "I don't know where we are. We must have got lost after that last turn." [...] Cox then transmitted; [...] "This is FT-74, plane or boat calling 'Powers' please identify yourself so someone can help you." [...] The response {{after a few moments}} was a request from the others in the flight for suggestions. FT-74 tried again and a man identified as FT-28 (Taylor) came on. [...] "FT-28, this is FT-74, what is your trouble?" [...] "Both of my compasses are out", Taylor replied, [...] "and I am trying to find Fort Lauderdale, Florida. I am over land but it's broken. I am sure I'm in the Keys but I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>far</b> down and I don't know how to get to Fort Lauderdale." ...|$|E

500|$|Migratory birds may use two {{electromagnetic}} {{tools to}} find their destinations: one that is entirely innate and another that relies on experience. A young bird on its first migration flies in the correct direction according to the Earth's magnetic field, but does not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>far</b> the journey will be. It does this through a radical pair mechanism whereby chemical reactions in special photo pigments sensitive to long wavelengths {{are affected by the}} field. Although this only works during daylight hours, it does not use the position of the sun in any way. At this stage the bird is in the position of a Boy Scout with a compass but no map, until it grows accustomed to the journey and can put its other capabilities to use. With experience it learns various landmarks and this [...] "mapping" [...] is done by magnetites in the trigeminal system, which tell the bird how strong the field is. Because birds migrate between northern and southern regions, the magnetic field strengths at different latitudes let it interpret the radical pair mechanism more accurately and let it know when it has reached its destination. There is a neural connection between the eye and [...] "Cluster N", the part of the forebrain that is active during migrational orientation, suggesting that birds may actually {{be able to see the}} magnetic field of the earth.|$|E
500|$|The overall standings did {{not change}} until stage 12, on Bastille Day, which ended with the hors catégorie climb to Luz Ardiden. Voeckler {{finished}} ninth on the day, ceding 20 seconds {{to most of the}} race's top overall riders, but still had sufficient time in hand to remain race leader by nearly two minutes. Rolland finished at his side for tenth on the day. Voeckler had said the night before that he expected to lose the jersey on this stage. After the peloton mostly stayed together in stage 13, popular expectation for stage 14, including two first-category climbs on course and another hors catégorie climb at the finish (Plateau de Beille), again was for Voeckler to lose the jersey. But he not only retained the jersey, he also finished with the main group of overall favorites, losing time to only three riders and actually putting time into other riders such as Damiano Cunego and Tom Danielson. Voeckler himself again expressed his surprise at his successes, saying [...] "I was very surprised to be with the best riders up the Plateau de Beille climb. I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>far</b> I can go." [...] Stage 16 ended with a lengthy descent, from the second-category Col de Manse. Voeckler lost time to nearly all the race's top riders, and expressed after the stage his certainty that he could not win the Tour, but he remained race leader.|$|E

2500|$|GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd scored it 3.5 out of 10, {{calling it}} [...] "a buggy mess." [...] He criticised the {{touchscreen}} as unresponsive, and {{the map and}} menu scrolling as [...] "sluggish". He was also {{highly critical of the}} bugs, citing a mission which couldn't be completed until the sound effects were turned off, and another which crashes when the player zooms in or out. He concluded, [...] "when it functions, The Settlers can be laid-back fun. But given that you never <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>far</b> you're going to get before the next crash, why bother?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Goody {{appeared}} {{in her own}} reality TV shows and, regularly, in celebrity, trivia and gossip-oriented women's magazines such as Heat and OK!. She participated in the 2006 London Marathon but did not finish (collapsing after [...] of the [...] course), and recovered overnight at the Royal London Hospital. Before the marathon, Goody described her preparations to TV chef Gordon Ramsay: [...] "I've been eating curry, Chinese and drinking." [...] She said afterwards, [...] "I don't really understand miles. I didn't actually <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>far</b> {{it was going to}} be... I didn't want to let everyone down."

2500|$|A {{reporter}} and news {{director for the}} local radio station WHJB, John Murphy, {{arrived on the scene}} of the event before authorities had arrived, in response to several calls to the station from alarmed citizens. He took several photographs and conducted interviews with witnesses. His former wife Bonnie Milslagle later reported that all but one roll of the film were confiscated by military personnel. WHJB office manager Mabel Mazza described one of the pictures: [...] "It was very dark and it was with a lot of trees around and everything. And I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>far</b> away from the site he was. But I did see a picture of a sort of a cone-like thing. It's the only time I ever saw it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The final was contested by England and Australia. Just before half time, England led 21–0 through tries from Andrew Harriman, Lawrence Dallaglio and Tim Rodber, all {{converted}} by Nick Beal. Michael Lynagh {{scored a}} try before haf time, {{but failed to}} convert his own try. In the second half Australia hit back strongly and first David Campese and then Semi Taupeaafe scored further tries, the latter also converted by Michael Lynagh. However, time ran out on the Australians and it was England captain [...] "Prince" [...] Andrew Harriman who was presented with the Melrose Cup by the Princess Royal. [...] Adedayo Adebayo, {{a member of that}} victorious side later recalled how surprising the victory had been to the players involved in it. He said [...] "We were basically a scratch side. We got {{together for the first time}} as a team the week before, played one practice match and went on to win! But there were a lot of quality players in that side and looking back that's why we were able to wing it slightly – the talent came through.
