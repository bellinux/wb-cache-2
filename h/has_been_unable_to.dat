5|$|Sri Lanka {{became an}} {{independent}} nation in 1948. Since independence, the political relationship between Sinhalese and Sri Lankan Tamil {{community has been}} strained. Sri Lanka <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> contain its ethnic violence as it escalated from sporadic terrorism to mob violence, and finally to civil war. The Sri Lankan Civil War has several underlying causes: {{the ways in which}} modern ethnic identities have been made and remade since the colonial period, rhetorical wars over archaeological sites and place name etymologies, and the political use of the national past. The civil war resulted in the death of at least 100,000 people and, according to human rights groups such as Human Rights Watch, the forced disappearance of thousands of others (see White van abductions in Sri Lanka). Since 1983, Sri Lanka has also witnessed massive civilian displacements of more than a million people, with eighty percent of them being Sri Lankan Tamils.|$|E
