2500|$|Improving {{on earlier}} and less {{efficient}} water turbine designs in one historic mill town, the new Francis turbine {{was created in}} 1848, using scientific principles and testing methods producing a turbine design of 90% efficiency. More importantly, Francis's mathematical and graphical calculation methods advanced turbine design and engineering and allowed confident design of high efficiency turbines to exactly match a site's flow conditions. In the 1870s and deriving from uses in the mining industry, the high efficiency Pelton wheel <b>impulse</b> <b>turbine</b> was developed to use hydropower under very different flow and pressure conditions. [...] Advances in dam design also progressed, with the completion of Old Aswan Dam being considered a milestone of engineering over nature. At {{the time of its}} construction, nothing of such scale had ever been attempted: it also {{became one of the first}} dams to be limited by conservation considerations.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Impulse</b> <b>turbines</b> {{change the}} {{direction}} of flow of a high velocity fluid or gas jet. The resulting <b>impulse</b> spins the <b>turbine</b> and leaves the fluid flow with diminished kinetic energy. There is no pressure change of the fluid or gas in the turbine blades (the moving blades), {{as in the case}} of a steam or gas turbine, all the pressure drop takes place in the stationary blades (the nozzles). Before reaching the turbine, the fluid's pressure head is changed to velocity head by accelerating the fluid with a nozzle. Pelton wheels and de Laval turbines use this process exclusively. <b>Impulse</b> <b>turbines</b> do not require a pressure casement around the rotor since the fluid jet is created by the nozzle prior to reaching the blades on the rotor. Newton's second law describes the transfer of energy for <b>impulse</b> <b>turbines.</b> <b>Impulse</b> <b>turbines</b> are most efficient for use in cases where the flow is low and the inlet pressure is high.|$|R

40|$|Hydro <b>impulse</b> <b>turbines</b> {{are often}} {{referred}} to as a mature technology having been invented around 100 years ago with many of the old design guidelines producing machines of a high efficiency. However with recent advances in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) it is now possible to simulate these highly turbulent multiphase flows with good accuracy and in reasonable timescales. This has opened up an avenue for further development and understanding of these machines which has not been possible through traditional analyses and experimental testing.

The air turbines included in the paper are as follows: Wells type <b>turbines,</b> <b>impulse</b> <b>turbines,</b> radial turbines, cross-flow turbine, and Savonius turbine. The overall performances of the turbines under irregular wave conditions, which typically occur in the sea, have been compared by numerical simulation and sea trial.

Whilst this makes the Parsons turbine much longer and heavier, the overall efficiency of a reaction turbine is slightly higher than the equivalent <b>impulse</b> <b>turbine</b> for the same thermal energy conversion.|$|E

5000|$|The {{arrangement}} {{consists of}} a number of simple <b>impulse</b> <b>turbines</b> in series mounted on a common shaft. The exit steam from one turbine is made to enter the nozzle of the succeeding turbine. Each of the simple <b>impulse</b> <b>turbines</b> would then be termed a [...] "stage" [...] of the turbine. Each stage comprises its ring of nozzle and blades. The steam from the boiler passes through the first nozzle ring where its pressure drops and velocity increases. The high velocity jet steam is directed onto the first moving blades wherein nearly all of its velocity is absorbed. The steam pressure remains unaltered. The steam from the first ring of moving blades enters the second ring of nozzles where its pressure is further reduced and velocity increased again. The next ring of moving blades absorbs the velocity obtained from this second ring nozzle. The process is repeated in the remaining rings until the whole of the pressure has been absorbed.|$|R
