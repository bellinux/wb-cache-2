2500|$|Blasts from Boromir's <b>horn</b> <b>alerted</b> Aragorn, but he {{came too}} late to prevent the hobbits' capture. As Boromir lay dying, he remorsefully confessed to {{attempting}} to take the Ring from Frodo, and that his impending death was his penance. He urged Aragorn to save Minas Tirith, as he himself had failed. Aragorn reassured {{him that he had}} not failed, that [...] "few have gained such a victory". Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas placed Boromir's body in one of their Elven boats, with his sword, belt, cloak, broken horn, and the weapons of his slain foes about him. They set the boat adrift in the river toward the Falls of Rauros, and sang a [...] "Lament of the Winds" [...] as his funeral song.|$|R
50|$|On September 11, 1851, a slaveholder from Maryland (Edward Gorsuch) came {{bearing a}} warrant to recover his slaves. Gorsuch had {{information}} that his slaves were at Parker's farmhouse. Parker had received intelligence that Gorsuch, a federal marshal {{and others were}} on their way to his farmhouse. So when Gorsuch arrived, Parker and his cohorts were prepared. Eliza, Parker's wife, sounded a <b>horn</b> <b>alerting</b> neighbors that slave catchers were out and that help was needed. Both sides were resolute in their determination to prevail: Parker convinced of the immorality of slavery, and Gorsuch confident in the law and his right to own slaves. There are conflicting stories of why and how the shooting started but in the end Gorsuch was dead and his son (Dickinson) severely wounded.|$|R
5000|$|Klaxon is a {{trademark}} for {{a brand of}} electromechanical <b>horn</b> or <b>alerting</b> device. Mainly used on cars, trains and ships, Klaxon horns produce an easily identifiable sound, often transcribed onomatopoeiacally in English as [...] "awooga" [...] or [...] "ah-oo-gah." [...] Like most mechanical horns, the klaxon has largely been replaced by solid-state electronic alarms, though the memorable tone has persisted.|$|R
50|$|Five or more generations ago, this {{building}} housed a bakery and restaurant {{as well as}} a post office. Every midnight, the postal coach would enter the village, coming from the distant town of Freiburg in Breisgau. Long before the coachman approached the Old Post House, he would sound his <b>horn</b> to <b>alert</b> the postmaster to bring his bag of mail out on the street, because the postal coach did not stop.|$|R
5000|$|The film {{used the}} gimmicks of the Fear Flasher and the Horror <b>Horn</b> to <b>alert</b> viewers to grisly moments. [...] The film was {{released}} theatrically {{because it was}} too intense for television. [...] The gimmicks were added (along with a few star cameos like Tony Curtis, Suzy Parker, and Marie Windsor) to increase the running time. There are plot similarities between this and Dark Intruder, which was released the previous year.|$|R
50|$|Just {{after finding}} Laurie, Jill is {{killed by a}} scalpel-wielding Michael, who then pursues Laurie through the {{hospital}}. Laurie escapes {{to the parking lot}} and hides in Jimmy's car. Regaining consciousness, Jimmy exits the hospital and gets in the car to seek help, but he passes out again on the steering wheel <b>horn,</b> <b>alerting</b> Michael to their location. Loomis, Marion, and the Marshall get to the hospital just in time to save Laurie.

5000|$|John Read was {{an active}} member of the local citizen militia, the Union Home Guard. [...] The Home Guard was drawn from the male civilians of the town and {{integrated}} significant numbers of African Americans in the force. These armed and unarmed men patrolled the town at night to protect against raids from Confederate forces, and developed a system of signal <b>horns</b> to <b>alert</b> the regular Union forces in the event of an attack.|$|R
5000|$|At {{this point}} the train's <b>horn</b> blows, <b>alerting</b> the {{authorities}} (and the two fugitives) that someone is on the train. Barstow cancels the derailment. Ranken concludes that his two escaped convicts are fleeing by rail. Meanwhile, the two fugitives are discovered by Sara, a locomotive hostler, who explains that she sounded the horn and that the train is out of control. She convinces them that jumping off the train would be suicidal and explains {{that the only way}} to stop the train would be to climb into the lead engine and press its kill switch, a near-impossible feat.|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{the large}} numbers of Japanese troops in the {{immediate}} vicinity, Schrier's patrol made it to the rim of the crater at about 10:15 am, having come under little or no enemy fire, as the Japanese were being bombarded at the time. The flag was attached by Schrier and two Marines to a Japanese iron water pipe found on top, and the flagstaff was raised and planted by Schrier, assisted by Platoon Sergeant Ernest Thomas and Sergeant Oliver Hansen at about 10:30 am (on February 25, during a CBS press interview aboard the flagship [...] about the flag-raising, Thomas stated that he, Schrier, and Hansen (platoon guide) had actually raised the flag). The raising of the national colors immediately caused a loud cheering reaction from the Marines, sailors, and coast guardsmen on the beach below and from the men on the ships near the beach. The loud noise made by the servicemen and blasts of the ship <b>horns</b> <b>alerted</b> the Japanese, who up to this point had stayed in their cave bunkers. Schrier and his men near the flagstaff then came under fire from Japanese troops, but the Marines quickly eliminated the threat. Schrier was later awarded the Navy Cross for volunteering to take the patrol up Mount Suribachi and raising the American flag, and a Silver Star Medal for a heroic action in March while in command of D Company, 2/28 Marines on Iwo Jima.|$|R
50|$|Cotton and {{the other}} boys climb back into the truck and {{continue}} their journey to the ranch, but {{run out of gas}} just before reaching their destination. They walk {{the rest of the way}} and make their way through the fence maze on the ranch until they get the exit gate open so the bison can escape. However, the bison are content and have no intention of escaping, until Teft hot-wires a state-owned truck and Cotton drives into the herd of buffalo while blowing the truck's <b>horn,</b> which <b>alerts</b> the hunters that are camped out nearby. Cotton drives the truck through the herd of buffalo and over the edge of the Mogollon Rim to his death, which ends the book as the hunters surround the other boys.|$|R
50|$|According {{to popular}} legend, the town's name {{is derived from}} the samarsing, or horn of a Samar, an animal. Historically, it was used as a gateway to the local kingdom, Haihay. When there was any {{invasion}} this samarsing <b>horn</b> to <b>alert</b> the security of the kingdom. The King's palace was situated {{on the bank of the}} Bheden river. A Shiva temple had been constructed at Mahadevpali by the king on the river bank. The king of Ratnapur (Surguja) attacked this kingdom over the marriage of the only daughter of the Haihay king. During this aggression the Haihay King was killed and his kingdom was destroyed.

50|$|The last {{scheme of}} Andrew Moreton aims to prevent street robbery “first by heavenly, {{and then by}} earthly means”. The former consist in “enforcing and {{encouraging}} a reformation of manners, by suppressing of vice and immorality, and punishing profaneness and licentiousness”. Widespread immoral habits are the reading of lustful ballads, swearing, and alcohol abuse. The latter include the introduction of an efficient system of surveillance and lighting of the streets. First of all, {{it is necessary to}} substitute the current inept watch with a body of competent and physically strong men. These new guards should carry firearms, swords, and a <b>horn</b> to <b>alert</b> their co-workers. They should be assigned to areas which are not too large to be effectively monitored. In particular, “no watchman” should “stand above twenty doors distant from his fellow”. Moreover, they ought to be given salaries in recognition of their efforts. Secondly, streets need to be rendered visible a night. Therefore, it is important to set up a reasonable number of lamps which are technically capable of providing adequate lighting.|$|R
50|$|Tomkins tells Megan and Daniel {{to hide in}} {{a school}} bus. Chased by the zombies, Josh and Patrick seek safety in a prison bus, honking the <b>horn</b> that <b>alerts</b> the others to their location.

50|$|Sky Shield III, held on September 2, 1962 from 1:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., was North America's {{first test}} of {{procedures}} for clearing national civilian air traffic at short notice, such {{as would be}} done {{in the event of a}} Soviet attack. Hundreds of USAF trainers were used to simulate normal civil traffic levels and routes. The Air Force trainers launched 319 Lockheed T-33 light jets, 263 in the U.S. and 56 in Canada, from random and unannounced locations. As the <b>alert</b> <b>horn</b> sounded, Federal Aviation Administration controllers hustled to get them to civil airports far from the metropolitan targets that were presumed to be under mushroom clouds. All T-33s were on the ground in Canada within 49 minutes, and in the United States within 72 minutes.|$|R
