500|$|Today, {{forensic}} anthropology is a {{well established}} discipline within the forensic field. Anthropologists {{are called upon to}} investigate remains and to help identify individuals from bones when other physical characteristics which could be used to identify a body no longer exist. Forensic anthropologists work in conjunction with forensic pathologists to identify remains based on their skeletal characteristics. [...] If the victim is not found for a lengthy period of time or has been eaten by scavengers, flesh markers used for identification would be destroyed, making normal identification difficult if not impossible. [...] Forensic anthropologists can provide physical characteristics of the person to input into missing person databases such as that of the National Crime Information Center in the US or <b>INTERPOL's</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>notice</b> database.|$|R

30|$|An {{interesting}} observation {{was made}} during LIBS measurements performed at different spots over the brown painted areas. At the 1 st laser pulse analysis, chromium (Cr) was clearly detected {{but was not}} further observed during analysis at the same spot with the 2 nd and the following pulses. This implies {{that the existence of}} Cr is only superficial. It is noted that no lead (Pb) was detected, which in correlation with Cr could suggest the superficial existence of chromium yellow used in the <b>yellow</b> paint. <b>Noticing</b> that at the brown area investigated, it is seen that {{a small part of the}} paint is missing, in a way that indicates a local intervention performed at a later time, it could be speculated that the localized and superficial presence of Cr could be correlated with the application of an adhesive during a modern restoration (e.g. a lime free casein adhesive in which commonly an oxide or salt of chromium is added to improve water resistance) [40].|$|R

Chopra's golden swimsuit and Abraham's <b>yellow</b> trunks were <b>noticed</b> by the public, {{the media and}} fashion critics. The film influenced fashion trends in India, with its stars' costumes becoming popular (particularly Chopra's silver sari in [...] "Desi Girl"). Her sari's popularity encouraged designer Manish Malhotra to carry varieties of it in his store. The actor' looks and style were popular with youngsters and college students. Bachchan's floral shirts also were popular, and Chopra's look was mirrored by the public. Dostana ranks among the most stylish Indian films of all time, and was voted Most Stylish Film by Filmfare in 2013. Bollywood Hungama also ranked it the most stylish Bollywood film of all time.|$|R

40|$|Sulfur (S) {{is often}} {{classified}} as a “secondary” plant essential element, mainly due to a smaller plant requirement {{but also because it}} is less frequently applied as a fertilizer compared to other nutrients like the “macronutrients” nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). This has certainly been the case in Iowa where research for many years had not documented S deficiency or fertilization need for optimal corn or soybean production. However, if deficient, S can have a dramatic effect on plant growth and crop productivity – more than the classification “secondary” would imply. In Iowa, before 2005 more than forty years of field research with corn and soybean conducted at many locations across the state had measured a yield response to S fertilizer application only three times out of approximately 200 trials – an indication of adequate available S supply and limited deficiency. This began to change in the early 2000 ’s as producers in northeast Iowa <b>noticed</b> <b>yellow</b> plant foliage and reduced growth in areas of alfalfa fields. After investigating several potential reasons for the growth problems, such as plant diseases, research in multiple fields documented improved alfalfa plant coloration, growth, and forage yield with S fertilizer application (Lang et al., 2006). These responses, as well as questions about deficiency symptoms in corn, led to investigation of potential response to S application in corn and soybean...|$|R
50|$|The {{reason that}} Vasa was so well-preserved {{was not just}} that the {{shipworm}} that normally devours wooden ships was absent but also that the water of Stockholms ström was heavily polluted until the late 20th century. The highly toxic and hostile environment meant that even the toughest microorganisms that break down wood had difficulty surviving. This, along {{with the fact that}} Vasa had been newly built when she sank, contributed to her conservation. Unfortunately, the properties of the water also had a negative effect. Chemicals present in the water around Vasa had penetrated the wood, and the timber was full of the corrosion products from the bolts and other iron objects which had disappeared. Once the ship was exposed to the air, reactions began inside the timber that produced acidic compounds. In the late 1990s, spots of white and <b>yellow</b> residue were <b>noticed</b> on Vasa and some of the associated artefacts. These turned out to be sulfate-containing salts that had formed {{on the surface of the}} wood when sulfides reacted with atmospheric oxygen. The salts on the surface of Vasa and objects found in and around it are not a threat themselves (even if the discolouring may be distracting), but if they are from inside the wood, they may expand and crack the timber from inside. As of 2002, the amount of sulfuric acid in Vasas hull was estimated to be more than 2 tonnes, and more is continually being created. Enough sulfides are present in the ship to produce another 5,000 kilograms (11,000 lb) of acid at a rate of about 100 kilograms (220 lb) per year; this might eventually destroy the ship almost entirely.|$|R
40|$|The umbucajazeira is specie {{native to}} the Brazilian Northeast {{semiarid}} areas, which is economically explored based on the fruit. The fruit ha s a high agroindustrial potential, mainly for jam production. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate through sensorial analysis, two formulations of umbu-caja jams: a dietetic one with xylitol, used as an option for sub stitution of the sugars, and a conventional one. The proportion of 50 : 50 : 0. 5 (pulp/sugar/pectin or pulp/xylitol/pectin) was used for jam processing. The mixture was concentrated up to reach 65 ° Brix. The jams were evaluated by 50 non-trained tasters, through a hedonic scale of nine points, whereas the following attributes were used: appearance, color, flavor, aroma and texture. The results of the physical and physicochemical analysis showed that the characteris tics of jams prepared with sucrose are close to the ones made with xylitol, except for the total sugars and the energetic value. The jams had pH values ranging between 2. 37 and 2. 92; titratable acidity varying between 0. 56 and 0. 78 g citric acid/ 100 g pulp; soluble solids ranging between 60. 92 ° and 65. 08 ° Brix, respectively. A tendency for <b>yellow</b> color was <b>noticed</b> by the color analysis. Jam diet had the highest scores for appearance (7. 4 - 7. 7). No significant differences (p > 0. 05) were obtained to flavor and texture. The fruit of the umbucajazeira showed to be adequate for jam manufature since they had good sensorial acceptance. The use of xylitol was satisfactory for obtaining a product with jam charac teristics similar to the conventional jam, but with lower energetic value. </p...|$|R

(These areas are described at the case definition page). In this country, {{only a small number}} of suspected or probable cases of SARS have been detected among exposed healthcare personnel and household contacts of SARS patients. Casual contact with SARS patients at schools, other institutions, or in non-healthcare work settings has not resulted in documented transmission in the United States. The following are interim recommendations to assist businesses and other organizations that have employees returning from areas with SARS after travel for business or personal reasons. More information for persons traveling to areas with SARS can be found at [URL] this time, CDC is not recommending quarantine of persons returning from areas with SARS. While in areas with SARS, persons who have fever or respiratory symptoms should not travel and should seek medical attention. Travelers who arrive in the United States from areas with SARS are receiving <b>yellow</b> health alert <b>notices</b> upon arrival, notifying them of the importance of monitoring their health closely for a period of 10 days and of seeking medical evaluation promptly if fever, cough, or difficulty breathing develop. Persons returning from areas with SARS should be vigilant for fever (i. e., measure temperature twice a day) and respiratory symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, or difficulty in breathing) over the 10 days after departure. These persons need not limit their activities and should not be excluded from work, meetings, or other public areas, unless fever or respiratory symptoms develop. Persons returning from areas with SARS should notify their healthcare provider immediately if fever OR respiratory symptoms develop within 10 days after departure. The healthcare provider should be contacted in advance so arrangements can be made, if necessary, for infection control measures to prevent transmission to others in the healthcare setting (see Updated Interim Domestic Guidelines for Triage and Disposition of Patients Who May Have SARS). Such persons should not go to work or other public areas until advised to do so by their healthcare provider. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, 2003 VirusSARS Viru...|$|R
