Of note were the use of concepts from Android and Windows Phone, such as a similarly minimal and typographic <b>design,</b> <b>Control</b> Center being an equivalent to similar settings toggles on the notification shade of Android, a similar multitasking menu to WebOS, and even {{the design of the}} Weather app being almost identical to those on Windows 8 and HTC Sense. Sascha Segan of PC Magazine stated that [...] "Apple's brilliance is in putting the pieces together and marketing them. Apple's developer APIs and its history of making money for developers still reign supreme—there's less piracy than on Android, and a bigger audience and more design flexibility than on Windows Phone." ...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{accommodate}} the actuator failure, the finite-time stable nonsmooth control method with RBF neural network is used to suppress the structural vibration. The traditional <b>designed</b> <b>control</b> methods neglect influence of actuator failure in structural vibration. By Lyapunov stable theory, the <b>designed</b> <b>control</b> method is demonstrated to suppress the building structural vibration with actuator failure. Finally, there are some examples to numerically simulate the three-layer building structure which is affected by El Centro seismic wave. Control effect of nonsmooth control is compared with no control and LQR control.

40|$|The {{stabilization}} of a Rotary Inverted Pendulum based on Lyapunov stability theorem is investigated in this paper. The key of <b>designing</b> <b>control</b> laws by Lyapunov control method is {{the construction of}} Lyapunov function. A logarithmic function is constructed as the Lyapunov function and is compared with the usual quadratic function theoretically. The comparative {{results show that the}} constructed logarithmic function has higher numerical accuracy and faster convergence speed than the usual quadratic function. On this basis, the control law of stabilizing Rotary Inverted Pendulum is designed based on the constructed logarithmic function by Lyapunov control method. The effectiveness of the <b>designed</b> <b>control</b> law is verified by experiments and is compared with LQR controller and the <b>control</b> law <b>designed</b> based on the quadratic function. Moreover, the system robustness is analyzed when the system parameters contain uncertainties under the <b>designed</b> <b>control</b> law...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- In this paper, we have {{highlighted}} {{the importance of}} the wheeled mobile robot (WMR) model for <b>designing</b> <b>control</b> strategies. In this sense, the differential model has been used as reference model in order to <b>design</b> the <b>control</b> algorithm. After the <b>control</b> has been <b>design,</b> new actions will be generated for each additional wheel of the real vehicle (non-differential model). This new approach simplifies the overall <b>control</b> systems <b>design</b> procedure. The examples included in the paper, illustrate the more outstanding issues of the <b>designed</b> <b>control.</b> Moreover, we have particularized this control for the line tracking based on a vision system. Also, we have simulated and validated this control, studying the effect of the sampling time on the WMR behavior...|$|R

This study case starts on modeling the quadrotor dynamics in order to <b>design</b> a backstepping <b>control</b> which we applied directly to the Lagrangian dynamic equations. The backstepping control is chosen due to its applicability to this class of nonlinear and under-actuate system. To test the <b>designed</b> <b>control</b> law, a complete quadrotor model identification was performed, using a motion capture system. The procedure used to obtain a good model approximation is presented. Experimental results illustrate {{the validity of the}} <b>designed</b> <b>control</b> law, including rich simulations and real indoor flight tests...|$|R
